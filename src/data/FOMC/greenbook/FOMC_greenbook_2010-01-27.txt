Domestic Nonfinancial Developments 
  Note:  A list of abbreviations is available at the end of Part 2. On balance, the data we received during the intermeeting period suggest that economic 
activity has continued to  improve.  Consumer spending was well maintained in the fourth 
quarter, and business expenditures on equi pment and software appear to have 
strengthened.  However, the improvement in  the housing market has slowed lately, and 
spending on nonresidential structur es has continued to fall.  Recent data sugge st that the 
pace of real business inventor y liquidation decreased considerably in the fourth quarter, 
providing a sizable boost to economic activity.  Moreove r, industrial production 
advanced at a solid pace in the fourth quart er after a large incr ease in the previous 
quarter.  In the labor market, layoffs subsid ed noticeably in the fourth quarter, but the 
unemployment rate remained elevated and hi ring conditions remained weak.  Meanwhile, 
increases in energy prices have  pushed up top-line consumer pr ice inflation, even as core 
consumer price inflation has remained subdued. 
 
Labor Market Developments  
The pace of job loss has continued to modera te.  Private nonfarm payroll employment fell 
64,000 in December after no change in Novemb er and a decline of 163,000 in October.  
Smoothing through these monthly fluctuations, the three-month change in employment 
has shown steady improvement since early last year, and this pattern has been widespread 
across industries.  Of particul ar note, the temporary help services industry—a bellwether 
of developments in the labor market—a dded nearly 50,000 jobs per month during the 
past three months.  Employers also may ha ve begun to lengthen workweeks:  The 
average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers was 33.2 hours in November and December after hove ring at 33.1 hours since March. 
 As with the payroll data, key measures from  the household survey show some moderation 
in the rate of deterioration in the labo r market.  The unemployment rate moved up 
another ¼ percentage point in the fourth quarter to an average of 10 percent after an increase of almost ½ percentage  point in the third quarter.  These increases contrast with 
the steep rise of 4 percentage points in the jobless rate that occu rred over the preceding 
year.  In addition, the fraction of workers on part-time schedules for economic reasons 
increased only slightly, on net, in the sec ond half of 2009.  In contrast, the labor force 
participation rate has declined  steeply since the sp ring, likely reflecting, at least in part, 
the ongoing deterioration in labor market conditions.

The slower rise in the unemployment rate since midyear primarily reflects a moderation 
in layoffs rather than an improvement in hi ring.  Both the number of new job losers and 
initial claims for unemployment insurance have  fallen over the past several months.  The 
rate of layoffs and discharges as measured in the November Job Openings and Labor 
Turnover Survey (JOLTS) has also moved dow n from its highs last winter, but its 
progress has been more erratic. 
 
In contrast, hiring conditions remain weak.  Measures of job openings and hiring in the 
JOLTS were little changed, on net, between  April and November, and, although help-
wanted advertising and survey-based indicators of hiring pl ans rebounded a bit in 
December, they remain near the depressed le vels seen throughout 2009.  As a result, the 
average length of ongoing unemployment spells  has risen steeply, and joblessness has 
become increasingly concentrated among those out of work for more than 26 weeks.  
Indeed, as of December, 40 percent of une mployed persons have been unemployed for 
more than half a year, up from 23 percen t one year earlier.  Rising unemployment 
duration is also reflected in the increasing share of total claimants for unemployment insurance who are receiving extended or emergency benefits.  Although the number of persons receiving unemployment insurance be nefits through regular state programs has 
been declining for some time, the total num ber of individuals r eceiving unemployment 
insurance—including extended and emerge ncy benefits—has continued to climb. 
 Most other indicators of the labor market—s uch as the number of firms reporting hard-to-
fill positions in the NFIB survey and individu als’ perceptions of current job availability 
from the Conference Board survey—remain w eak.  However, households’ expectations 
of future labor market conditions have rebounded a bit recently.  We estimate that output per hour of all persons  in the nonfarm business sector rose at an 
annual rate of 7.1 percent in the third qua rter—as hours declined  sharply and output 
expanded—following a similarly large increase in the second quarter.  Over the four 
quarters ending in the third quarter of 2009, labor productivity is estimated to have 
increased 3.7 percent.  Despite  the outsized productivity gains, wage increases have been 
quite subdued.  Average hourly earnings rose  0.2 percent again in December, bringing the 
12-month change to 2¼ percent, noticeably lowe r than the nearly 4 pe rcent rise seen over 
2008.

                                                Industrial Production  
Expansion in the industrial sector was well ma intained in the fourth  quarter.  Industrial 
production (IP) rose 0.6 percent in December, the sixth consecutive increase since its 
trough last June.  The gain in December primarily resulted from a jump in output at electric and natural gas util ities due to unseasonably cold weather.  In manufacturing, 
production edged down last month but advanced at an annual rate of  5¾ percent in the 
fourth quarter as a whole after having incr eased 9 percent in the third quarter.  The 
increases in manufacturing IP in the sec ond half of 2009 reflected the ongoing recovery 
in motor vehicle output, risi ng export demand, and a slower pace of business inventory 
liquidation.   
 The factory operating rate in December, at 68.6 percent, was 3 percentage points above 
its June trough, though it was s till 11 percentage points belo w its average for the period 
from 1972 to 2008.    Production of light motor vehicles edged down in December.  Nonetheless, the average pace for the fourth quarter as a whole, at 6.9 million units, was ½ million units above the 
pace in the third quarter.  Dealer inventorie s expanded moderately in  the fourth quarter 
after having contracted sharpl y in each of the three prev ious quarters.  Days’ supply 
moved up to 53 days at the end of the fourth quarter, a level still we ll below the industry 
target of about 65 days.  Accordingly, manuf acturers’ assembly plans suggest that light 
motor vehicle production will rise further in th e first quarter of 2010, to an annual rate of 
7.3 million units.    Elsewhere in the transportati on sector, commercial aircraft  production increased at an 
annual rate of 5½ percent in the fourth qua rter.  Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, which had its 
maiden test flight in December after more than two years of delays, should provide a boost to commercial aircraft produc tion starting late this year. 
 
Production in high-tech industries posted a m odest increase of 5½ percent in the fourth 
quarter.  Since mid-2009, domestic semiconduc tor manufacturers have benefited from 
strong foreign demand for high-tech products—such as personal computers and cell phones—that use domestically produced chips.  However, with inventories currently lean 
and with utilization ra tes at semiconductor factories at hi gh levels, the industry may have 
trouble promptly meeting further increases in demand.
1  Domestic demand for high-tech 
 
1  Indeed, shortages of components reportedly delayed delivery of computers by a major manufacturer 
over the holiday season, and spot market prices for some key semiconductors remain elevated.

products has also been improving, but the eff ect on domestic producti on—particularly of 
computers—has been limited by rising import penetration. 
   
Looking ahead, available indicators suggest so lid increases in high-tech production in the 
first quarter
.  Orders for circuit boards were  above shipments for a fourth consecutive 
month in November and point to continue d gains in the semiconductors and related 
electronic components industry.  Revenue guida nce from Intel suggests further increases 
in microprocessor production in the current qua rter.  Forecasts from outside consultancies 
as well as corporate comments from IBM, Seagate, Micron, and key telecommunications 
service providers are consistent with rising output for computers and communications 
equipment in the near term.  
 
Outside of energy, mo
tor vehicles and part s, aircraft and parts, and high-technology 
industries, production decreased ¼ percent in December after large a nd widespread gains 
in November.  The output of consumer goods, business equipment, and materials rose in the fourth quarter, though the average monthl y gains in these categories were a little 
smaller than in the third quart er.  In contrast, the output of  construction supplies fell in 
the fourth quarter after having edged up in the third quarter.  
   
The available near-term i
ndicators of production suggest that IP will continue to increase 
in the coming months.  The new orders diffusion index from the national ISM survey jumped in December to a level consistent  with sizable near-term increases in 
manufacturing output, while the new orders  indexes from the regional manufacturing 
surveys are suggestive of more-modest pr oduction gains.  The three-month moving 
average of the staff’s series on real orders for durable goods (adjusted to exclude industries for which reported orders have little information content for predicting 
shipments) rose in November and was consis tent with a moderate gain in manufacturing 
output in coming months.  In the first reading on January activity, the new orders index 
from the Empire State survey reversed most  of its decline from the previous month.  
 
Consumer Spending  
Consumer spending continued to  trend up through the end of last year.  Real PCE rose 
0.3 percent in November, putting it on track to increase at an annual rate of more than 2 percent in the second half of the year.  St ill, overall spending re mained well below its 
pre-recession level.  Smoothing through the sharp movements in income and spending caused by various stimulus programs, the savi ng rate, at 4.7 percent in November, was 
little changed over 2009 following a sharp increase in 2008.

The available data for spending in December have been mixed.  Given the retail sales report and the CPI, we estimate that real PCE control (goods excluding motor vehicles 
and gasoline, plus food services) declined 0.3 percent in December after increasing at a 
solid average monthly rate of 0.6 percent in the four previous months.  However, the 
dropback in spending in December may have par tly reflected transitory  factors, such as 
the unusually cold weather and a major winter  storm the weekend before Christmas, as 
well as an apparent ongoing shift in the timing of holiday purchases.
2 
 In contrast, sales of light vehicles rose to an annual rate of 11¼ million units in December.  Smoothing through the ups and downs related to the “cash for clunkers” 
program, the underlying demand for light vehicles appears to have improved in the fourth 
quarter.  Although consumer attitudes toward  car-buying conditions and incentives at 
automakers were little changed in early Ja nuary, a preliminary estimate from J.D. Power 
and Associates suggests that sales this m onth have been running below the pace in 
December.  The fundamental determinants of household spending strengthened modestly, on balance, 
near the end of the year but were still ma rked by general weakness.  Real disposable 
personal income (DPI) rose 0.2 percent in Nove mber.  Over the past year, real DPI likely 
increased about 1½ percent, with most of this modest gain stemming from fiscal stimulus.  Equity prices continued to advance solidly in recent weeks, wh ile house prices edged 
down in November.  Although household bala nce sheets have improved considerably 
since last winter, household net worth from mid-2007 to present has still experienced a 
loss equivalent to nearly 1½ years of household income.  Measures of consumer sentiment have held steady, on net, since the summer at levels that are much improved 
from those early last year.  Despite the im provement, sentiment remains at low levels by 
historical norms.  Similarly, while credit conditions for auto loans have improved 
significantly since midyear, terms and standard s on other consumer loans, particularly on 
credit cards, remain very tight.  
 
2 In recent years, spending appears to have gradually shifted from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, 
perhaps because of deep post-holiday discounting or the increased use of gift cards.  Because the seasonal 
factors will be slow to incorporate this shift, the s easonally adjusted retail sales data will be held down 
somewhat in December but boosted in January.

                                                Housing   
The recovery in the housing market slowed in the second half of 2009.  Sales of new 
single-family homes in November were 15 percent below their pace in July after having 
risen 27 percent in the preceding six months.  Moreover, although sales of existing 
single-family homes shot up 25 percent from  July to November, the plunge in the 
pending home sales index in November suggests that much of this increase was transitory, possibly reflecting sales that were pulled forward ahead of the anticipated 
expiration of the first-ti me homebuyer tax credit.
3  On net, the pending home sales index 
rose only 5 percent from May to November, co mpared with a 10 percent increase in the 
previous six months. 
 
The slowdown in sales notw ithstanding, a number of fact ors supported housing dem
and 
in the second half of the year .  Interest rates for conformi ng 30-year fixed-rate mortgages 
were very low by historical standards and remained low through mid-January.  Although 
the repeat-sales price index for existing single-family homes calculated by LoanPerformance edged down in November, it still stood 4 percent above its trough in 
March—a marked change from the 22 percen t decline over the 12 months ending in 
March.  In addition, in the Reuters/Universi ty of Michigan Surveys of Consumers for 
early January, the number of respondents who e xpected house prices to increase over the 
next 12 months continued to exceed the numbe r of respondents who expected prices to 
decrease.

ilar to the pattern of new home sales, st arts of single-family homes retreated a little 
from June to December after advancing bris kly last spring.  According to anecdotal 
reports in the Beige Book  , loans for 
acquisition, development, and c onstruction became more difficu lt to obtain in the fall, 
which may have contributed, in part, to the deceleration in construction activity.  
However, adjusted permit issuance in this sector rose in December to a level not seen 
since September 2008, signaling an upturn in starts in the near term.  In the much smaller 
multifamily sector—where credit conditions ar e very tight and vacancies are elevated—
starts deteriorated a bit further, on ba lance, in the second half of the year. 
 
Although th
e pace of new home sales is still modest, it has been ample enough, given the 
slow pace of construction, to reduce furthe r the overhang of unsold new single-family 
 
3 In November, the Congress extended the first-time homebuyer tax credit by six months and expanded 
it to include repeat homebuyers who have owned and occupied a house for at least five of the past eight 
years.

                                                houses.  The stock of unsold new homes fell agai n in November and is now less than half 
of its peak in mid-2006; however, measured re lative to the November pace of sales, the 
months’ supply of new homes, which now stands at 8 months, is only about one-third 
below its peak in January 2009.  More broadly, the vacancy rate for homes intended for owner occupancy (which includes both exis ting and completed new homes for sale), 
although down from its peak in 2008, is stil l quite high relative to pre-2006 levels. 
 
Equipment and Softwa
re  
Real spending on equipment and software (E&S ) appears to have risen robustly in the 
fourth quarter after having increased at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the previous 
quarter.  Business outlays on transportation equi pment apparently surged  last quarter, and 
spending outside of the transportation sector  is on track to post a solid increase. 
   
Business purchases of motor vehicles increase d briskly in the four th quarter.  Although 
sales of light vehicles to fl eet cust
omers fell back a bit in December, they rose in the 
fourth quarter as a whole.  In addition, new vehicle leases have stepped up sharply in 
recent months after having plunged to a very low level in the firs t half of the year.4  Sales 
of medium and heavy trucks moved up in December for the fourth consecutive month.  After jumping in September and October, ne w orders for medium and heavy trucks fell 
back, on net, in November and December; the recent volatility in orders was likely driven 
by new environmental regulations on diesel engines that took effect in January 2010. 
 
After posting a modest gain in the third qua rter, spending on high-tech equipm
ent appears 
to have risen at a considerably more rapid cl ip in the fourth quarter.  Both orders and 
shipments of high-tech equipment rose marked ly, on net, in October and November.    
Moreover, industrial production of computers increased further in the fourth quarter.  
According to a representative from Dell, th e company expects continued strong spending 
on computers over the next 18 months as busin esses do a “rolling refr esh” of an aging 
computer stock.   
 
Outside of the transportation and high-tech sectors, business investme
nt appears little 
changed in the fourth quarter.  Orders and shipments increased in November, reversing 
their declines in October.  The increase in orders and shipments in November was concentrated in industrial machinery.   
 
 
4 New vehicle leases, which are included in the light  vehicle sales data each month, are counted as a 
business purchase in the national accounts even if the vehicle is held by a household.

The apparent pickup in overall equipment spe nding in the fourth quarter is consistent 
with the trend in a variety of  other indicators of business demand.  In December, both the 
ISM index of manufacturing activity and the Philadelphia Fed’s indicator of general 
business conditions rose to their highest levels  in several years.  Similarly, yields on 
BBB-rated corporate bonds have declined to 2006 levels.  In addition, according to the 
latest SLOOS, banks generally ceased tighten ing standards on comme rcial and industrial 
loans but have yet to unwind the unprecedente d tightening that occurred over the past two 
years.  Meanwhile, banks’ responses indicated that the credit quality  of their outstanding 
loans to small firms in the fourth quarter was worse than that of such loans to large and 
middle-market firms.  Those responses are c onsistent with reports that small businesses 
are continuing to find credit difficult to obtain. 
 
Nonresidential Constr
uction  
Conditions in the nonresidential construction se ctor generally remain poor.  Real outlays 
on structures outside of the drilling and mi ning sector dropped at an annual rate of 
23 percent in the third quarter, and r ecent data on nominal expenditures through 
November point to an even fast er rate of decline in the f ourth quarter.  The weakness has 
been widespread across categories and likely re flects the drag from rising vacancy rates, 
plunging property prices, and difficult financin g conditions for new projects.  According 
to the latest SLOOS, a substantial share of banks reported both tighter policies on 
commercial real estate loans and weaker dema nd for such loans.  In addition, the most 
recent reading from the architectural billings index remained at levels consistent with 
further declines in spending in the first half of this year. 
 
Following a steep drop in the fi rst half of the year, real spending on drilling and m
ining 
structures rose at an annual rate of about 9 percent in the third quarter.  Increases in the 
number of drilling rigs in ope ration and footage drilled point to a similar expansion in the 
fourth quarter.  The upturn in investment in this sector was stimulated by a rebound in oil 
prices.   
 
Business Inventories   
The pace of real business inventory liquidation appears to have decreased considerably in 
the fourth quarter.  Information from the moto r vehicle sector indica tes that auto dealers 
added to their stocks last quart er.  In addition, after three quart ers of sizable declines, real 
nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles ra n off at a more modest pace in October, 
and book-value data for this category suggest th at inventories may have  increased in real 
terms in November.  Although the book-value data for October and November received a

                                                sizable boost from
 wholesale i nventories of farm products that reflected an unusually 
large and unusually late crop harvest, the moderation in the pace of stock liquidation 
outside of the motor vehicle industry app ears to have been relatively widespread.5  Taken 
together, the recent inventory data indicate th at the change in inventory investment is 
likely to make an appreciable c ontribution to the rate of change  of real GDP in the fourth 
quarter.  The measure of months’ supply implied by the book-value data has fallen 
significantly since mid-2009 and is only a litt le above the range observed in the year 
before the recession.  
 
The staff’s flow-of-goods inventory system , which uses industrial production data 
through Decem
ber, also suggests that inventor ies outside motor vehicles declined at a 
noticeably slower pace than in the third quart er.  This measure of months’ supply edged 
down, on net, during the fourth quarter and ha s now reversed about one-half of its run-up 
from mid-2008 to mid-2009.  Among market groups, inventories of consumer goods 
appear well-aligned with the current pace of sales, but months’ supply for equipment, 
materials, and construction s upplies remain elevated.   
 
In the m
anufacturing ISM for December, the number of supply managers who described 
their customers’ inventories as too low incr eased further and continued to exceed those 
who described inventories as too high by a very  wide margin.  This reading suggests that 
managers in manufacturing expect their customers to do some restocking in the coming months.

Federal Go
vernment Sector  
Incoming data suggest that total real purch ases by the federal government decreased 
moderately in the fourth quarter after havi ng risen substantially in the preceding two 
quarters.  This decrease in federal expenditures reflects a marked decline in real defense spending as indicated by the Monthly Treasur y Statements through December.  However, 
outlays for defense tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter, a nd defense expenditures 
 
5 Wholesale inventories of farm products rose at an  annual rate of $43 billion, on average, in book 
value terms in October and November after declining $6½ billion in the third quarter. 
6 The question posed to purchasing managers in the ISM survey to determine whether stocks are too 
high or too low does not specify the measure of sales against which respondents should compare the level 
of their customers’ inventories.  If the respondents currently are judging inventories against a level of expected sales in coming months that is materially ab ove the recent pace of sales (a plausible assumption 
given the marked improvement in recent months of the ISM’s new orders index), then the low level of the 
customers’ inventories measure may well be consistent with the inventory ratios in both the book-value 
data and the staff’s flow-of-goods system  that use the current pace of sales.

                                                in the fourth quarter appear ed to be below a trend leve l of spending that is more 
consistent with what would be allowed by budget appropriations.   
 
The unified federal budget defici t widened further in the first three m
onths of fiscal year 
2010, pushing federal debt held by the public up to around 55 percent of GDP.  Receipts 
were 11 percent lower in the October to D ecember period relative to the same period a 
year earlier, primarily because  of the effects of continued weakness in taxable income as 
well as the revenue-reducing provisions of  the 2009 stimulus legislation.  On the 
spending side, outlays declined 4 percent in the first three months of the fiscal year 
relative to the same year-earlier period.  However, this decline reflected TARP-related outlays; excluding these outlays , expenditures increased abou t 7 percent, boosted by both 
the effects of the weak labor market on low-income support programs, such as unemployment insurance and food stamps, and the spending from the stimulus package.
7  
In all, about $285 billion in stimulus funds  (about 36 percent of the total $787 billion 
stimulus package) had been distributed in th e form of spending increases and tax cuts by 
the end of December. 
 
State and Local Government Sector  
Real purchases by state and local governments appear to have been roughly flat in the 
fourth quarter.  Notably, employment appear ed to stabilize:  The sector averaged a 
modest 5,000 net new hires per month in the fourth quarter after having shed 32,000 jobs per month in the third quarte r.  Meanwhile, real construc tion spending moved sideways 
following large increases in th e second and third quarters. 
 Despite the substantial federa l aid provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act, state and local governments continue to  face significant fiscal headwinds because 
tax revenues are still declining.  Ac cording to the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Summary of 
State and Local Government Tax Revenue , total tax collections fell almost 7 percent in 
the third quarter relative to the year-earlier  period.  Personal income tax and sales tax 
receipts decreased significantly  at the state level, whereas local property ta x collections 
rose modestly.  A recent report from The Nels on A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, 
based on data from 38 states in October and November, suggests that state tax revenues 
continued to decline in the fourth quarter but at a more moderate pace than in the 
preceding three quarters.  These revenue declin es have generated budget shortfalls at the 
state level.  The National Conf erence of State Legislatures reports that th ese shortfalls, 
 
7 Outlays associated with the TARP were only $6 b illion in the first three months of the current fiscal 
year, in contrast to the $91 billion recorded in the same period last fiscal year.

Prices  
Consumer price inflation in December was m odest after having been boosted in recent 
months by increases in energy prices.  Base d on our translation of the CPI and PPI, we 
estimate that overall PCE prices increased 0.1 percent in December after rising ¼ percent 
in November; core PCE prices are estimated  to have edged up 0.1 percent in December 
after remaining flat in November.  For the year as a whole, we estimate that overall PCE prices increased about 2¼ percent on a 12-month change basis, up from ½ percent in 2008; the pickup in overall inflation was th e result of a rebound in energy prices.
8  Food 
prices fell last year, while both core PCE prices and mark et-based core PCE prices 
increased 1½ percent in 2009, somewhat less than in 2008. 
 
Consum
er energy prices rose ¼ percent in  December and 4½ percent in November.  
Gasoline prices moved up again in December, and the advance in crude oil prices since the last Greenbook, as well as the latest available survey data, suggest that gasoline prices increased at a faster pace in  January.  Over the 12 months  of 2009, the PCE energy price 
index advanced 21 percent, reversin g most of its decline in 2008.  
 
Food prices have turned up m
odestly of late.  The PCE price index for food and 
beverages edged up 0.1 percent in both Oct ober and November and rose 0.3 percent in 
December after posting sizable declines earlier in the year.  For the year as a whole, 
consumer food prices fell 1½ percent after surging 6¾ percent in  2008; this pattern 
largely reflects the pass-through of the huge sw ings in spot prices of farm commodities 
over the past two years. 
 
Excluding food and energy, PCE inflation slowed noticeably last year.  Core PCE prices 
rose at an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the first half of 2009, simila r to the pace in 2008, 
and then increased at an annual rate of only 1¼ percent in the second half.9  This 
slowdown in core inflation was concentrat ed in market-based components; nonmarket-
based price inflation turned up briskly in th e second half.  Among se rvices, the index for 
 
8 Note that on a four-quarter change basis, we estimate that overall PCE inflation was 1¼ percent in 
2009, down from 1¾ percent in 2008.  The difference between the four-quarter changes and 12-month 
changes reflects the effects of large price declin es recorded in November  and December of 2008. 
9 Excluding tobacco, the deceleration in  core PCE prices was steadier:  Af ter rising at an annual rate of 
1¾ percent in 2008, core PCE prices excluding tobacco rose at an annual rate of about 1½ percent in the first half of 2009 and 1 percent in the second half.

housing services decelerated dramatically last  year and actually fell in the second half, 
likely reflecting the poor stat e of the housing market.  Aside from housing and energy, 
price increases for market-based services sl owed early last year and remained modest 
throughout 2009, possibly reflecting th e deceleration in labor costs.  Prices for core goods 
also decelerated considerably last year apart from the tax-induced increases in tobacco 
prices and the rebound in mo tor vehicle prices.   
 
Median near-term
 inflation expectations in the Reuters/University of Michigan survey 
increased in January to 2.8 percent from 2.5 percent in December.  Meanwhile, median 
inflation expectations over the next 5 to  10 years edged up 0.1 percentage point from 
their December reading to 2.8 percent—still near  the lower end of the narrow range that 
has prevailed over the past few years.  The TIPS-based measure of inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead has changed little since the previous FOMC meeting, 
whereas five-year inflation compensation ha s moved up somewhat; as discussed in the 
“Domestic Financial Developments” section, most  of the increase in five-year inflation 
compensation likely reflects changes in liquidity and infla tion risk premiums. 
 
At earlier stages of proce ssing, the PPI for core interm
ediate materials rebounded in 
November and December following October’s dec line.  Despite these recent increases, 
the December PPI for core intermediates was essentially unchanged fr om its year-earlier 
level.  In contrast, commodity prices have  rebounded considerably over the past year 
from their sharp drop in late 2008.  Since the December Greenbook, both the Commodity Research Bureau spot index of industrial materials and the Journal of Commerce index of 
industrial materials have continued to move up—rising 3¾ percent and 6¾ percent, 
respectively—reflecting, in large part, sizable increases in metals prices.

Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview 
Over the intermeeting period, conditions in fi nancial markets improved a bit further, as 
incoming data bolstered investors’ confidence in the recovery in economic activity.  
Yields and spreads on both investment-g rade and speculative-grade corporate bonds 
declined, and broad stock-price indexes rose.  Bank stoc k prices outperformed broad 
equity indexes, and several large banking or ganizations issued equ ity and repaid TARP 
capital.  However, conditions in  commercial real estate markets remained strained, with 
delinquency rates on commercial mortgages rising further.  In addition, credit flows 
remained weak overall, with further runo ffs in bank loans to both households and 
businesses.  While the Senior Loan Offi cer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
(SLOOS) conducted in January 2010 indicate d that the tightening of banks’ credit 
standards might be coming to an end, st andards and terms on most types of loans 
remained tight, and loan demand continued to weaken, on net. 
 
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
The FOMC’s decision to keep th e target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the 
December meeting and the retention of the “extended period” language in the statement 
were widely anticipated and elicited little price response.   Later in the intermeeting 
period, the expected path  of monetary policy inferred fr om futures markets quotes shifted 
down slightly, on net, as market particip ants interpreted some Federal Reserve 
communications, including the discussion about the large-scale asse t purchases in the 
FOMC minutes, as pointing to a more protracted peri od of accommodative monetary 
policy than had been anticipated.  Futures quo tes currently indicate that the federal funds 
rate is expected to rise above 25 basis points during the third quarter of 2010 and reach 
about 2 percent by the end of 2011.  
 
In contrast to the slight downward shift in policy expectations, yiel ds on 2-year and  
10-year nominal Treasury securities increased  by about 4 basis points and 10 basis points, 
respectively, consistent with a slight fu rther unwind in flight-to-quality demands.  
Measures of TIPS-based infl ation compensation over the ne xt five years rose about 
20 basis points; staff models in terpret the increase as largel y reflecting an increase in 
inflation risk premiums and some improveme nt in TIPS market li quidity.  Inflation 
compensation 5 to 10 years ahead declined about 8 basis points.

Financial Institutions and Short-Term Funding Markets 
Over the intermeeting period, investor sentimen t about prospects for financial institutions 
improved a bit further.  Stock prices of both large and regional banks increased.  CDS 
spreads ticked up for large bank holding companie s and were about flat for other banks.  
In December, a few major banking organizations issued common equity to private investors and repaid the remainder of th e government’s preferred equity shares.  
However, the Treasury Department continues to  hold common equity shares in Citigroup.  
Recently, sentiment about financial institutions  appeared to be boosted by a generally 
positive start to the earnings season and only tempered somewhat by the Administration’s proposal for a “financial crisis responsibil ity fee” that would be levied on financial 
institutions with more than $50 bi llion in total assets.       
 In December, the Treasury announced that it would increase its capital commitment to 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from  $200 billion per institution to any amount necessary 
to ensure that each firm would maintain positiv e net worth over the next three years.  In 
addition, the Treasury provided additional capital to GMAC, though not as much as had been anticipated.  Short-term funding markets were generally st able over the intermeeting period.  One- and 
three-month Libor-to-OIS spreads remained low while six-month sp reads continued to 
edge down.  Spreads on A2/P2-rated commerc ial paper and AA-rated ABCP held steady 
at the low end of their ranges since mid- 2007.  Strong demand for Treasury bills in the 
cash and repo market, together with a seasona l decline in bills out standing, put downward 
pressure on both bill yields and short-term repo rates.    Year-end pressures in short-te rm funding markets were generally modest amid ample 
liquidity.  The repo market experienced some year-end dislocations, with a few 
transactions reportedly occurri ng at negative interest rates, but that market now appears 
to have largely recovered.  
Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities 
Use of Federal Reserve credit facilities edged lower over the in termeeting period, and 
market commentary suggests little concern a bout the impending expiration of a number 
of the facilities.  Three of the facilities scheduled to e xpire on February 1—the TSLF, 
PDCF, and AMLF—have no loans outstanding, while  the CPFF, also set to expire on the 
same date, has a modest amount outstanding.  Because of the normal lack of market 
activity around year-end, there was only  one TALF-supported new issue over the

intermeeting period, a $1.5 billion auto floor-plan ABS deal.  At the mid-December 
CMBS subscription, $1.3 billion in loans coll ateralized by legacy CMBS were extended, 
and a similar amount is expected for the January subscription.  
 
In Decem
ber, the Federal Reserve Board proposed the establishment of a term deposit 
facility.  Under the proposal, the Federal Re serve banks would offer interest-bearing term 
deposits to eligible institutions through an auction mechanism as a means of draining 
reserves.  The news was generally well r eceived by markets and elicited little price 
response. 
 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock-price indexes rose about 4 pe rcent, on net, over th e intermeeting period, 
consistent with further indications that th e economy is recovering.  The gap between the 
staff’s estimate of the expected real e quity return over the next 10 years for 
S&P 500 firms and the real 10-year Treasur y yield—a gauge of the equity risk 
premium—was little changed and remained we ll above its average le vel during the past 
decade.  However, option-implied volatility  on the S&P 500 index edged down to the low 
end of its range since mid-2007.  
 
Over the interm
eeting period, yields on both investment- and specula tive-grade corporate 
bonds declined, even as those on comparable-m aturity Treasury securities inched up.  As 
a result, spreads on investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed 
about 45 basis points and 80 basis points respect ively.  Risk spreads on investment-grade 
corporate bonds have nearly returned to the levels that prev ailed before mid-2007.  
Estimates of bid-asked spreads for corpor ate bonds—a measure of  liquidity in the 
corporate bond market—remained steady.  In the leveraged loan market, average bid 
prices rose and bid-asked sp reads were little changed. 
 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
As shown by data from the national inco me accounts, profits of nonfinancial and 
financial corporations conti nued to rebound in the third quar ter.  Amid relatively few 
earnings announcements or warnings through mid-January, analysts’ forecasts of year-
ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms were little changed.  Over the past several days, the 
initial spate of fourth-quarter earnings re ports generally exceeded analyst forecasts. 
 On balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial firms has continued to improve in recent months.  The aggregate ratio of debt to asse ts for nonfinancial corporations decreased in

the third quarter, while the a ggregate liquid asset ratio rose  and now stands above its 
previous peak in 2004.  The pace of nonfinancial corporate ratings downgrades by 
Moody’s remained moderate in the fourth quarter, while the pace of upgrades rebounded, 
largely owing to the upgrade of Ford Motor Company in December.  Meanwhile, the six-month trailing bond default rate for all U.S. firms dropped further in December and 
has now retraced almost all of the run-up sin ce the outset of the financial crisis.  The 
year-ahead expected default frequency for nonfinancial firms from Moody’s KMV 
inched down a bit in the month ending in mid-January. 
 
Business Finance 
In December, gross issuance of invest ment-grade and speculative-grade bonds by 
nonfinancial corporations continued to be so lid, and early indicatio ns suggest that bond 
issuance has picked up a bit in January.  In  contrast, commercial paper outstanding was 
little changed, and C&I loans continued to c ontract.  Overall, net debt financing by 
nonfinancial businesses was close to flat in the fourth quarter , after declining in the third 
quarter, consistent with weak demand for cred it and still tight cred it conditions at banks. 
 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial  firms m
aintained its solid pace in 
December; the pace was fueled by the continue d strength of initial equity offerings.  
Equity retirements from cash-fi nanced mergers rose sharply in  the fourth quarter, mostly 
because of the completion of two large deals in the pharmaceutical industry.  As a result, 
net equity issuance by nonfinancial firms, which had been positive in the first three 
quarters of 2009, turned negative in the four th quarter.  Although announcements of new 
share repurchase programs were sparse in the fourth quarter, announcements of cash-financed mergers and acquisitions increased. 
 
Public equ
ity issuance by financial firms surged in December, as several large banks 
were able to sell record-high volumes of shares to investors to raise funds to repay the 
Treasury for capital acquired under the TARP program.  Gross bond issuance by financial 
firms continued to be somewhat slower than in the third quarter. 
 
Commercial Real Estate Finance  
Financing conditions for commercial real estate remained strained.  Outstanding 
commercial mortgage debt is estimated to have  decreased at an annual rate of 3½ percent 
in the third quarter of 2009, and recent data su ggest another decline in  the fourth quarter.  
In December, the dollar value of commercia l real estate sales ticked up, as market 
participants tried to close deals by the end of the year, but th e level of activity remained

very low by historical standards and transac tion prices appeared weak.  In October, 
Moody’s index of commercial property prices  decreased about 2 percent, bringing the 
index back to its 2002 level—40 percent be low its mid-2007 peak.  Delinquency rates on 
loans in CMBS pools increased further in December.  CDS index prices on CMBS were 
little changed, on net, over  the intermeeting period. 
  
Household Finance  
The average interest rate on 30-year conformi ng fixed-rate mortgages increased to just 
over 5 percent over the intermeeting period.  Howe ver, the increase in this mortgage rate 
was slightly smaller than that in the 10-year  Treasury yield, leaving the mortgage spread 
to the 10-year Treasury yield a touch narrower.  Net issuan ce of agency MBS dropped in 
November to its early 2009 level.  As yet, there are few signs that the tapering of the 
Federal Reserve’s purchases of MBS ahead of the scheduled completion of the MBS 
purchase program in March is putting much upward pressure on MBS yields. 
 
The repeat-sales house-price index from
 LoanPerformance ticked down in October and 
November, and the S&P/Case-Shiller index was unchanged in October, after rising 
modestly in previous months.  Both indexe s are about 30 percent below their peaks in 
2006.  In November, delinquency rates for fi xed- and variable-rate prime mortgages 
continued to climb and the delinquency ra te for FHA-backed loans reached nearly 
8 percent. 
 
Consum
er credit contracted for the tenth consecutive month in November, pushed down 
by a further steep decline in revolving credit.  Gross consumer ABS issuance slowed in 
the fourth quarter, in response to a widening in spreads and typical year-end effects, but 
is expected to be strong in the first quar ter of 2010, as suggested by the current calendar 
of offers.  Credit card ABS issuance was mi nimal in October and November but picked 
up in December, following the FDIC’s announcem ent of a temporary extension of safe-
harbor rules for its handling of  securitized assets should a sponsoring bank be taken into 
receivership.  Changes in spr eads of consumer loan interest  rates over two-year Treasury 
yields were mixed.  Credit card interest rate  spreads continued to increase in November, 
while spreads on new auto loans continued to trend down through early January.  Delinquency rates on consumer loans remained high in recent months. 
 
Long-term mutual funds received sizable net inflows in December, with large net flows 
into bond funds more than offsetting net redemptions from equity funds.  In early January, bond, hybrid, and equity funds all attracted net inflows.  Money market funds

continued to experience net outflows in Decem ber and early January, as yields paid by 
these funds remained extremely low. 
 
Treasury Finance 
During the intermeeting period the Treasury  auctioned $192 billion of nominal coupon 
securities and $10 billion of inflation-protec ted securities.  Consistent with typically 
weaker demand around year-end, the auctions  in the last week of 2009 were less 
favorably received than those in previous m onths, as indicated by relatively-low bid-to-
cover ratios.  However, the auctions since year-end have garnered stronger demand.   
 
Also consistent with typical  seasonal patterns, Treasury trading volum
es were on the 
lower side of their recent ranges.  The repo market experienced some dislocations, 
including negative repo rates and a modest rise in fails to deliver.  However, the cash 
market continued to function normally, with on-the-run premiums and yield curve fitting 
errors little changed over the intermeeting period.  
 
State and Local Government Finance 
Financing conditions in the municipal bond mark et appeared solid.  Gross issuance of 
long-term municipal bonds remained robust in  December, mostly driven by continued 
strength in new capital issuance.  The pace of short-term issuance picked up a bit, but remained subdued.  Ratings data from Moody’ s show that the numbe r of municipal bond 
downgrades outpaced the number of upgrades in the third quarter of 2009.  Yields on 
long-term municipal bonds were about flat ove r the intermeeting period and their ratios to 
those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities remained at levels within the typical historical range.  
 
Money and Bank Credit 
M2 continued to expand sluggishly in December,  rising about 2 percent at an annual rate.  
Although growth in liquid deposits remained robust, small time deposits and retail money 
market mutual funds continued to contract at  a rapid pace in response to the low yields on 
those assets.  The monetary base was roughly flat in December, as the contraction in 
credit outstanding under liquidity and credit facilities was a bout offset by th e increase in 
reserves from the large-scale asset purchases.

Commercial bank credit continued to contra ct in December; an increase in banks’ 
securities holdings was more than offset by a large drop in total loans1.  C&I loans and 
commercial real estate loans again fell st eeply.  Paydowns continued to be the most 
commonly cited reason for the decline in C&I loans, and reports of large originations 
remained sparse.  In the fourth quarter, C& I loans contracted sharply at large domestic 
banks and foreign banks, while the decline at smaller domestic banks abated somewhat.  
Holdings of closed-end residential mortgages were little changed in  December, but home-
equity loans continued to run off.  Cons umer loans originated by banks contracted 
further, reflecting continued substantia l weakness in credit card loans.   
 
For the year as a whole, the substantial dec line in
 total loans was only partly offset by 
high growth in cash assets, which include reserves and now account for 10 percent of 
total bank assets.  Overall, industry a ssets dropped more than 5 percent in 2009. 
 
Although lending standards for m
ost types of lo ans were little changed according to the 
January SLOOS, banks’ standards and terms on all major loan types remained tight in the fourth quarter, and the demand for loans gene rally weakened further (see the appendix to 
this section).  A substantial fraction of banks  continued to tighten their credit policies on 
commercial real estate loans. 
 
 
 
                                                 
1 Available data indicate that, so far, about 10 banks have consolidated about $115 billion in total 
assets onto their books in conjunction with the ad option of new accounting rules FAS 166 and 167, and 
many more banks are expected to do so by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The effects of these 
consolidations have been removed from the bank credit data presented here.

Appendix 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey on Bank Lend ing Practices  
 
The January 2010 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicated that 
commercial banks generally ceased tightening standard s on most loan types in the fourth quarter 
of last year but have yet to unwind the unpreced ented tightening that has occurred over the past 
two years.  The net fraction of banks reporting tight er loan terms continued to trend lower.  Banks 
reported that loan demand from both businesses a nd households weakened further, on net, over 
the survey period.1 
 
For m
ost major loan categories covered by the survey, the net fraction of respondents that 
tightened standards in the fourth quarter of 2009 was close to zero, an i ndication that the recent 
bout of tightening in credit standards may be draw ing to an end.  However, banks continued to 
tighten a number of terms on loans to both businesses and households, although the net fractions 
of banks that reported doing so in the January  survey generally stepped down again.  Banks’ 
policies on commercial real estate (CRE) lending are an exception, as large net fractions of respondents further tightened their credit standards during the final quarter of last year.  In addition, banks reported that they had tightened  terms on CRE loans substantially over the past 
year. 
 
Banks’
 responses regarding commercial and indust rial (C&I) lending indicated some disparities 
between recent changes in their credit policies for small firms and those for large and middle-market firms.  For example, some banks repor ted easing a number of price and nonprice terms on 
C&I loans over the past three months, and, in sev eral cases, a few more banks did so on loans to 
large and middle-market firms than did so on loans to small firms.  These differences may partly reflect differences in the current and expected credit quality between firms in the two size categories.  Indeed, in response to special ques tions on credit quality, banks indicated that the 
credit quality of their outstanding loans to large and middle-market firms in the fourth quarter was better than that for small firms; moreover, respondents indicated that the outlook for credit 
quality in 2010 was more positive for larger firms than for their smaller counterparts.  
 
Demand from both 
businesses and households for all major categories of loans weakened further, 
on net, over the past three months.  The net frac tions of banks that reported weaker demand for 
                                        
              
1 The January 2010 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses and 
households over the past three months.  The survey also included three sets of special que stions:  The first set asked 
banks to compare the delinquency rate of commercial and i ndustrial loans made to small firms to the delinquency rate 
of such loans made to large and mi ddle-market firms, the se cond set asked banks about changes in policies on 
commercial real estate loans ove r the past year, and the third set asked banks about their outlook for the loan quality of 
a number of categories of loans in 2010.  This appendix is based on responses from 54 domestic banks and 22 U.S. 
branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Respondent banks  received the survey on or after December 29, 2009, and 
their responses were due by January 12, 2010.

business loans continued to decline, while cha nges in the comparable readings on demand for 
loans to households were mixed. 
 
In response to a set of special questions on asset quality, the majority of banks indicated that their 
outlook for the change in credit quality in 2010 was less pessimistic relative to their outlook, 
when asked one year ago, for the change in cr edit quality in 2009.  Outside of commercial and 
prime residential mortgages, banks generally  expect asset quality to stabilize this year. 
 
Lending to Businesses 
 
Questions on commercial and industrial lending.  Overall, banks reporte d little net change in 
their standards for C&I loans in the fo
urth quarter  of 2009.  However, moderate net fractions of 
domestic banks continued to tighten both price and nonprice terms on C&I loans to large and 
middle-market firms as well as to small firms.  In general, the net fractions  of banks that reported 
a further tightening of loan terms over the past three months were considerably below those from 
recent surveys, though the net fraction of banks that reported further increases in loan rate 
premiums for risky borrowers remained somewhat elevated.  In a tentative sign that the current 
credit cycle may be coming to an end, some of the largest domestic banks (those with assets greater than $20 billion) reported having eased lo an terms to large and middle-market firms, 
particularly terms pertaining to loan maturiti es and loan spreads.  Similarly, branches and 
agencies of foreign banks reported, on net, that they had eased most loan terms over the past three months. 
 
The reported thawing of loan term
s at large domes tic banks and foreign institutions for C&I loans 
to large firms is consistent with the substantial narrowing of credit spreads in the corporate bond market—an important alternative source of credit for large business borrowers—and improved 
conditions in the syndicated loan market, which includes many nonbank lenders.  Indeed, almost 
all of the domestic and foreign institutions that reported having eased credit standards or loan 
terms over the past three months cited incr eased competition from other banks and from nonbank 
sources of funding as an important reason for the ch ange in their lending posture.  In addition, a 
majority of banks that eased some of their loan terms viewed the improved economic outlook as an important reason for the change in their credit policies.  
 
In contrast, moderate net fractions of sm
aller domestic bank respondents (those with total assets 
below $20 billion) continued to tighten terms on loans to firms of all sizes.  Moreover, the net fractions of domestic banks that  tightened terms on loans to small firms were generally a little 
larger than the net fractions that tightened terms on loans to large and middle-market firms.  Most 
banks that tightened standards and terms continued to point to a weaker or more uncertain economic outlook as one of the reasons, and many ba nks reported greater aversion to risk as well. 
 
Demand for C&I loans—from firms in both size categories—weakened further, on net, at domestic banks over the past three months.  Th e net fraction that reported weaker demand over

the past three months was only somewhat smaller th an it was in the October survey.  In contrast, 
foreign institutions reported that loan demand was ab out unchanged, on net, over the same period.  
Almost all banks that reported weaker loan de mand indicated that their customers’ financing 
needs for investment in plant and equipment ha d declined as had funding needs for inventories 
and accounts receivable.  Most of the handful of  banks that experienced  an increase in loan 
demand cited a shift in demand from other credit sources to their bank, increased merger and 
acquisition activity, and higher credit demand for financing accounts receivable.  The number of 
inquiries for new or expanded C&I credit lines—which tends to be a leading indicator of near-term changes in loan demand—weakened again, on net, at domestic banks, but at a more moderate pace than in recent quarters; foreign in stitutions, in contrast, re ported little change in the 
number of inquires for new or expanded C&I credit lines over the survey period. 
 
Special questions on delinquency rates on C&I loans by firm size.  In response to a speci al 
question about the quality of C&I loans on banks’ books in the fourth quarter, banks reported 
higher delinquency rates on loans to small firms than on loans to large and middle-market firms.  On net, nearly 65 percent of domestic respondents indicated that in the fourth quarter of 2009, the delinquency rate on their outstanding loans to small firms was higher than the rate on outstanding loans to large and middle-market firms.   
Questions on commercial real estate lending. 
 In contrast to C&I lending, a substantial share of 
domestic banks, on net, reported ha ving tightened standards on CR E loans again in the fourth 
quarter of 2009.  Consistent with the weak f undamentals in the sector, domestic banks reported a 
further weakening in demand for such loans.  Moderate net fractions of foreign banks also 
reported having tightened standards on CRE loans and having seen weaker demand for such loans 
over the past three months.  
 
Special question on commercial real estate lending.  In response to a special 
question (repeated 
on an annual basis since 2001), large net fractions of both domestic and foreign institutions again 
reported having tightened a range of terms on CRE loans over the course of 2009.  The largest net 
tightening was reported on the spreads of loan rates over banks’ cost of funds, debt-service 
coverage ratios, and loan-to-value ratios.  
Lending to Households 
 
Questions on residential real estate lending.  Banks continued to tighten standards on 
residential real estate loans over the past three m onths.  In line with recent patterns, a small net 
fraction of banks reportedly tightened standards on prime residential real estate loans over that 
period, and somewhat larger net fractions of  banks tightened standards on nontraditional 
residential real estate loans.2  For the first time since the January 2009 survey, a moderate net 
fraction of banks reported weaker demand from prim e borrowers for residential real estate loans, 
                                                      
2 Only two banks reported that they had made subprime residential real estate loans over the survey period.

a pattern consistent with the so fter recent data on housing market activity, including home prices 
and new home sales.  Demand from customers seeking nontraditional mortgages weakened 
further over the survey period.  Only a small net fraction of banks reported having tightened 
standards on revolving home equity lines of credit over the past three months, but a substantial net fraction of banks continued to report lower demand for such loans.  
 
Questions on consumer lending.  For the first time i n nearly three years, banks reported an 
increased willingness to make consumer installmen t loans now as opposed to three months ago.  
However, demand for consumer loans weakened fu rther in the January survey:  A sizable net 
fraction of banks again reported weaker demand for consumer loans of all types, a reading that stayed within its range of the past few years.  
Regarding credit card loans, a very sm
all net fraction of banks reported having tightened 
standards on such loans over the past three months.  However, substantial net fractions of banks 
indicated that they had reduced credit limits on cr edit cards and had become less likely to issue 
cards to customers not meeting credit scoring thr esholds.  A moderate fr action reported having 
increased spreads.  These results are consistent  with responses to the October 2009 survey, in 
which banks indicated that they would tighten a wide range of their credit card policies following 
the enactment of the Credit CARD Act.  For cons umer loans other than credit card loans, banks 
reported no change, on net, in their standards in the January survey.  Moreover, respondents 
indicated little change in most terms on such loans. 
 
Special Questions on Banks’ Outlook for Asset 
Quality  
The January survey included a set of special qu estions that asked banks about their outlook for 
delinquencies and charge-offs across major loan categories in the current year, assuming that 
economic activity progresses in line with consensus forecasts.  This set of special questions has been asked on an annual basis since 2006.  In gene ral, the outlook for loan quality in 2010 was 
among the least pessimistic recorded since this ser ies of questions began.  In the previous two 
years, large majorities of banks expected wid espread deterioration in credit quality over the 
coming year across all major loan categories.  In  this survey, by contrast, substantially fewer 
banks reported having such expectations; banks anticipated signifi cant additional deterioration in 
the quality of only CRE loans, prime residential mortgages, and revolving home equity lines of credit this year, with the quality of other loan s expected to change little or improve, on net. 
 Regarding C&I loans, a substantial net fracti on of banks reportedly expect delinquencies and 
charge-offs of such loans to large and middle-mark et firms to decline in 2010.  A much smaller 
net fraction of banks expect an improvement in the credit quality of C&I loans to small firms, 
which suggests that many small business borrowers are likely to continue to face tight credit 
conditions this year. 
 
III-A-8
 
On the household side, a moderate net fraction of banks indicated that the credit quality of their 
prime residential mortgages and home equity loan s would likely deteriorate further in 2010.  
However, banks reportedly expect portfolios of most  other types of consumer and residential real 
estate loans to experience little further deterior ation in credit quality this year—indeed, banks 
indicated that they hold a relatively optimistic outlook for the credit quality of other consumer 
loans, with a moderate net share of banks re portedly expecting some improvement in credit 
quality in this loan category.

The U.S. international trade deficit wi dened to $36.4 billion in November, from 
$33.2 billion in October, as a sharp rise in  nominal imports outpaced an increase in 
exports. 
 
 
 
The value of exports of goods and servi ces moved up 0.9 percent in November after 
increasing by almost 3 percent in both Sept ember and October.  The November increase 
was driven primarily by a surge in agricultu ral exports, which was partially offset by a 
decline in consumer goods af ter a robust October.  Exports  of capital goods rose, as 
computers and semiconductors built further on increases in October.  Exports of 
automotive products were boosted by strong exports to Canada, while exports of industrial supplies were flat.  In the first two months of the fourth quart er, nominal exports jumped a robust 22 percent 
at an annual rate, continuing to retrace the declines recorded in late 2008 and the first half 
of 2009.  The fourth-quarter increase was broad-based across capital goods, consumer 
goods, industrial supplies, automotive products, a nd services.  Agricultural products also 
had a notable increase, reflecting rising quantities and prices.

The value of imports of goods and services ro se 2.6 percent in November after posting a 
modest gain of 0.7 percent in October.  Im ports of oil accounted for roughly one-third of 
the November increase, which reflected rising prices as volumes were  flat.  Most other 
categories of imports also recorded gains in November.  A prominent exception was 
automotive products, which shrank modestly foll owing three months of strong growth.   
 
For the first two m
onths of the fourth quarter , nominal imports rose by 24 percent at an 
annual rate, down somewhat from the rapid third-quarter pace.  However, as with 
exports, these increases have re versed only a small amount of the earlier steep decline.  
The fourth-quarter increase was broad- based across major categories of imports. 
 
Prices of Internationally Traded Goods  
Non-oil imports.   Prices for im ported non-oil goods rose 0.5 percent in December, in 
line with their increases over the past four  months.  The pickup was driven by higher 
prices for material-intensive goods, particularly nonfuel indust rial supplies.  Prices for 
finished goods were flat. 
 
In the fourth quarter, non-oil im
port prices as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS) increased 5¾ percent at an annual ra te.  The increase largely reflected higher 
prices for material-intensive goods.  Prices for finished goods imports rose a more modest 1 percent.   
 
Oil.  The B
LS price index of imported oil fell 2 percent in December after an increase of 
more than 6 percent in November.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil followed a similar pattern, dippi ng roughly 4 percent in December from an 
average of $78 per barrel in the previous month.  Spot WTI has increased early in the 
new year, closing most recently on January 19 at $79 per barrel.  The higher oil prices in late December and early January reflect st ronger demand from China as well as from a 
spell of colder-than-expected temperatures across much of the northern hemisphere. 
 
Exports.   Goods export prices rose 0
.6 percent in December, a little less than in the 
previous month.  Once again, growth in the prices for these goods came from material-
intensive goods, where prices of both ag ricultural products and industrial supplies 
increased about 2 percent.  However, prices  for imported finished goods were unchanged. 
 
IV-5 
For the fourth quarter, goods export prices on a BLS basis increased 3¾ percent at an 
annual rate.  Prices for material-intensive  goods shot up 10 percent, while prices for 
finished goods edged up only 1 percent. 
IV-6 
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Since the previous Greenbook, we have received  Treasury data on inte rnational financial 
transactions through November and partial da ta for December and January.  On balance, 
official purchases of long-term U.S. Treasur ies have remained elevated while private 
foreigners have continued to purchase U.S. equities and, more recently, long-term U.S. 
Treasuries.  
 Foreign official inflows slippe d a bit in November but remain ed strong  (see line 1 of the 
table “Summary of U.S. Intern ational Transactions;” see also  the figure “Foreign Official 
Financial Inflows through November 2009”).  Pu rchases of long-term Treasuries (line 1a) 
increased smartly and offset a shift to net sa les of short-term Treas uries (line 1b).  Since 
August of 2009, official foreigners have been se lling bills or letting their bill holdings roll 
off.  This has brought the share of bills in their portfolios back towa rd pre-crisis levels 
and has been in line with the overall composition of Treasuries outstanding.  Confidential custody data from FRBNY suggest further robust official inflows in December.  
Foreign official holdings of Treasuries at  FRBNY increased modestly and there was a 
large increase in holdings in the Repo Pool, which acts as a deposit account.  Through the 
first half of January, foreign official holdings at  FRBNY declined as Repo Pool holdings 
dropped back.    Net official financial inflows in Novemb er also received a boost from a further 
$11 billion decline in outstanding drawings  by foreign central banks on the Federal 
Reserve swap lines.  Drawings on the swap lines involve U.S. purchases of foreign currency, which are recorded as an official U.S. claim on foreigners, and repayments of those drawings therefore gene rate inflows.  As of the end of 2009, the outstanding 
balances on the lines totaled $10 billion, dow n from a high of $583 billion in December 
2008.  The decline in the swap draw ings has coincided with re newed net lending abroad by 
banks located in the United States amounting t o, on net, $44 billion in November (line 3).  
Bank flows tend to be volatile  but, overall, net lending has grown as gross claims on 
foreigners trended up throughout 2009 while gross liabilities to forei gners leveled out.  A 
rebound in lending through the repo market has contributed to the growth in gross claims, though they are still far below their pre-crisis levels.   
 
Private foreigners purchased on net $47 billion of Treasuries in November, a break from 
the pattern of net sales, which totaled $74 b illion, from March to October (line 4a; see 
IV-7 
also figure “Private Securiti es Flows through November 2009”) .  Purchases of Treasuries 
reflected acquisitions of bonds and notes that outstripped reductions in bills (not shown 
separately).  This pattern is similar to that of official holdings, la rgely reflecting a change 
in the composition of Treasuries outstanding.  Private foreign investors continued to 
show interest in U.S. equities (line 4d) in November and continued to sell, on net, agency 
(line 4b) and corporate bonds (line 4c), despite robust issuan ce of corporate bonds. 
 
U.S. investors purchased, on net, $3.1 billion of foreign securities 
in November, a sharp 
decline relative to purchases in October (l ine 5).  These small purchases of foreign 
securities reflected acquisitions of foreign bonds (line 5a) offsetting small net sales of 
foreign stocks (line 5b).

Foreign Financial Markets 
The trade-weighted value of the broad nominal do llar is slightly higher than at the time of 
the December Greenbook, while foreign equity pr ices and sovereign yields have risen as 
markets seem to have revised up their vi ew of the prospects for global growth. 
 
The major-currencies index of the dollar’s value has increased ¾ percent, while the OITP 
index has declined slightly.  Consistent with  a shift in focus on growth and away from 
risk appetite, there was a change in the te nor of the foreign exchange market, with 
positive U.S. news leading to dollar apprecia tion and negative U.S. news leading to 
depreciation.  The dollar appreciated about 3 percent agains t the euro and yen as the 
market seemed to be driven by a growing real ization that U.S. growth prospects appear 
considerably better than in Europe and Japan.  Partially offsetting these moves, rising 
commodity prices and a strong outlook for Chin a led the dollar to decline against the 
currencies of commodity producers and against most emerging Asian currencies, though Chinese authorities continued to hold th e renminbi stable against the dollar  
 Benchmark sovereign yields have increased about 30 basis points in the United Kingdom, comparable to the increase in the United States, while yields in Germany and Japan have moved up 15 and 5 basis points re spectively.  Consistent with the rise in yields in the 
United Kingdom, expectations for the policy rate set by the Bank of England (BOE) as of 
the end of 2012 has increased as inflation has co me in higher than expected.  In contrast, 
expectations for the policy rates set by th e ECB and Bank of Japan (BOJ) are little 
changed over the forecast horizon.  Most of th e rise in nominal fo reign yields can be 
attributed to an increase in inflation compensation, and st aff estimates of nominal and 
real yield curves indicate that most of the rise in inflation compensation was at the short-
end of the term structure.  This may refl ect some increase in short-term inflation 
expectations associated with the recent move up in commodity prices, as survey measures 
of foreign inflation expectations have also  edged up; however, th e rise in inflation 
compensation may also reflect movements in the inflation risk premium and further improvement in the liquidity of indexed-debt markets.  
Although the rise in nominal sovereign yields is  consistent with greater confidence in the 
growth outlook and rising commodity prices , it may also have been affected by 
expectations of greater government a nd corporate borrowing in the coming year. 
Sovereign issuance is likely to be  at record levels this year  for many countries.  Corporate 
issuance also may be high; in 2009, for the first time on record, global corporate investment grade bond issuance surpassed s yndicated bank lending to investment grade 
IV-14 
corporations.  However, despite the prospect  of a large supply, pub lic bond offerings so 
far this year have met with reasonably str ong demand.  One notable ex ception to this is 
Greece, where the government has avoided any public offerings of long-term debt in 
January, stating that it may choose instead to pl ace its debt privately, out of concern that a 
public offering would not be met with strong demand.  Spreads on Greek debt over 
German bunds rose about 60 basis points as Greece was downgraded from A1 to A2 by 
Moody’s and the country continued intense nego tiations over its fiscal situation with the 
European Union.  Concerns about the fiscal situations in Spain a nd Portugal also led 
spreads on Spanish and Portuguese debt over German bunds to increase. 
 
In line with the mo
re positive view of growth  prospects, European and Japanese equity 
prices rose about 5½ percent.  European ba nk stocks indexes rose by a less than the 
headline indexes.  Although most earnings re ports for the fourth qua rter will not arrive 
for a month or more, Societe Generale issued  a profit warning and the Spanish retail bank 
Banesto posted disappointing results after raisin g its estimates of the losses it would incur 
from bad loans, rekindling some concern as to the health of  European banks. 
 
Although the Chinese stock prices have declin ed slightly on net, most other em
erging 
market equities indexes have risen at least 2 percent and a few have risen as much as 
12 percent.  Earlier in the period, emerging market equities had increased by even more; 
however, news late in the pe riod that the Peoples Bank of  China had raised reserve 
requirements caused a modest retreat in many emerging stock markets.   
 
.  In addition, 
Taiwan's central bank moved to curb speculative capital inflows.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
Incoming data suggest that activity in the advanced foreign economies continued to 
expand in the fourth quarter, though at a mode rate pace.  PMIs and confidence indicators 
generally advanced, industrial production firmed, and measures of capacity utilization 
rebounded from their third-quarter lows.  However, unemployment rate s remain elevated 
and consumption indicators were mixed.  Cr edit conditions improved further, as lending 
to the private sector expanded in most economies.  Increases in export and import volumes point to a gradual recove ry in international trade.   
 Amid rising energy prices, 12-month headline inflation for December picked up in all 
countries except Japan, where deflation m oderated only mildly.  Excluding food and 
energy, inflation remained subdued.  All majo r foreign central banks  have kept their 
policy rates unchanged.

fourth quarter.  Industrial pr oduction rose 2.2 percent in N ovember from the previous 
month and foreign orders climbed, as the industrial sector continues to benefit from the 
recovery in global trade.  I ndeed, real exports increased sharply in November following 
strong gains in the preceding two months.  However, a bounceback in real imports 
indicates that the contribution of the external sector to GDP  growth may be moderating.   
 Indicators of domestic demand, however, re main soft.  The monthly index of real 
consumption fell in November.  In Decembe r, new car registrations were flat and 
consumer confidence weakened for the s econd consecutive month.  Labor market 
conditions have yet to improve  significantly.  In November, machinery orders fell at 
double digit rate.  Higher busin ess confidence and a nascent increase in housing starts, 
however, indicate that private investme nt might be approaching a trough.

In November, the 12-month inflation rate moved up to negative 1.9 percent from an all-
time low of negative 2.5 percen t in October, as energy pric es rose.  Core inflation 
(excluding all food and energy) edged up to ne gative 1 percent.  Incoming data, however, 
point to ongoing deflationary pressures; in  December, both headlin e and core inflation 
declined further in the Tokyo area. 
 On December 18, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) left  its policy rate unchanged and repeated its 
commitment to maintain an extremely accomm odative policy stance.  Furthermore, the 
BOJ reiterated its goal to attain inflation of around 1 percent over the medium- and long-term.    In the next few weeks, the Japanese Parl iament is expected to approve the budget 
submitted by the Hatayama government for the 2010 fiscal year.  The budget proposal provides additional fiscal stimulus, including increased transfers to households and local 
governments.

Third quarter GDP growth in the euro area was revised up 0.2 percentage point to 
1.7 percent, reflecting a larger contribution from inventories.  Recent indicators have 
been mixed but, on balance, suggest that economic activity continued to expand, albeit 
moderately, in the fourth quarter.  Advance reports indicate that German GDP stagnated 
in the fourth quarter, surprising markets on th e downside.  In November, euro-area retail 
sales and new car registrations declined, after a middling perf ormance in October, and the 
unemployment rate reached 10 percent.  In  contrast, after edging down in October, 
industrial production rebounded in  November and PMIs rose further into expansionary 
territory in December.  More over, in December, several measures of economic sentiment 
reached their highest levels since July 2008.   
 
In December, 12-month inflation rose to 0.9 percent from 0.5 percent in November.  
Excluding all food and energy, November inflation was about 1.0 percent.    The ECB kept its benchmark policy rate un changed at 1 percent at its January 14 
meeting.  The ECB has continued to buy covered bonds, and by early January had 
purchased €29 billion out of planned €60 billion of total acquisitions.   
 Euro-area credit conditions ha ve improved considerably in recent months.  Household 
credit continued to expand through November.  Corporate credit edged down in October and was flat in November, suggesting that it might soon start to recover.  Tight bank 
lending standards have induced firms to issu e new debt in capital markets.  In 2009, 
nonfinancial corporations issued almost €100 billion worth of bond debt, making up for 
much of the contraction in bank loans.

In the United Kingdom , recent indicators suggest that the economy is finally emerging 
from the longest recession of the post-wa r period.  Labor market indicators have 
stabilized; the unemployment rate has remained  at just under 8 percent since May and the 
number of people claiming unemployment benefits edged down in November and 
December.  Output in the services sector pos ted modest gains in September and October, 
and industrial production inched up in Novemb er.  The volume of retail sales slid in 
November after registering solid gains in the previous two months.

Surveys paint a mixed portrait of the strength of the recovery.  In December, PMIs were consistent with the manufacturing and serv ices sectors growing at their pre-recession 
average.  By contrast, business and consum er confidence weakened in December, and a 
British Chambers of Commerce survey conducted late in the fourth quarter points to 
further stagnation.  Lenders reportedly incr eased the availability of secured household 
credit and corporate credit, but the ava ilability of unsecured household credit was 
restrained further.  
The housing sector continues to recover at a slow, yet steady, pace.  Loan approvals for 
house purchases rose for a 13th consecutive month in November, although they remained 
at only about one-half their pre-recession level.  House price indexes in December had retraced about one-third of their peak-to-tr ough decline while new construction orders in 
November lingered near their nadir. 
IV-28 
Twelve-month headline inflation surged to  2.9 percent in December as unusually large 
price declines in December 2008 – reflecting the value-added tax cut, sharp oil price 
decreases, and heavy discounts by retailers – dr opped out of the equation.  The recent rise 
in commodity prices and a weak sterling ha ve continued to exer t significant upward 
pressure on goods prices.  The price of c onsumer goods excluding food and energy rose 
3.2 percent in the 12 months to December, the fastest pace since the adoption of the 
current methodology in 1997.  By contrast, serv ices inflation edged up to 2.6 percent, a 
figure well below its recent trend.   
 As of January 14, the Bank of England had acquired £195 billion in se curities at its Asset 
Purchase Facility, nearly all of which (£193.2 billion) were gilts.  The BOE plans to purchase a total of £200 billion in assets through the creation of cen tral bank reserves by 
the end of January.

In Canada , data received for the fourth quarter have been positive.  The monthly GDP 
index rose at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in October following an outsized increase of 
5.2 percent in September.  Gains in output were broad based over the two months.  Real 
retail sales were up in October amid str ong sales of new cars, marking the sixth 
consecutive monthly increase.  Credit growth, which has remained relatively strong through the downturn, may get a further lift going forward.  According to the Bank of 
Canada’s senior loan officer survey, credit conditions eased in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2007.  
 The Canadian housing market has continue d to rebound forcefully.  Building permits 
have increased more than 70 percent from thei r February lows.  The level of permits is 
now only a touch below its average leve l during the boom years of 2006 and 2007.  
Prices for new houses rose 4½ percent at an an nual rate over the three months ending in 
November.  
 
 
Labor market conditions improved further in th e fourth quarter, as total employment rose 
at an annual rate of nearly 1 percent.  Public-sector employment advanced markedly, 
whereas private-sector employment edged up in  the last two months of the quarter, after 
having fallen in October.  Total hours of work  were unchanged over the quarter, as a rise 
in December hours offset previous declines.  The unemployment rate remained at 8.5 percent in December. 
IV-31 
Consumer prices rose 1. 2 percent over the 12 months ending in December, up 
0.2 percentage point from November.  Excluding food and energy, inflation was 
0.7 percent in December, remaining at its lowest level since the early 1990s.   
 
At its January meeting, the Bank of Canada ma intained its policy rate at 0.25 percent and 
reiterated its intention, conditional on the outlook  for inflation, to keep rates at this level 
until at least the end of the second quarter of 2010.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Economic activity in the emerging market econo mies continued to expand in the fourth 
quarter, although at a more moderate pace than in the third quarter.  Within emerging 
Asia, growth appears to have remained robus t in China and to have  slowed elsewhere. 
Exports continued to rebound, a lthough merchandise trade balanc es declined in a number 
of countries where strong domestic demand caused imports to outpace exports.  In Latin America, indicators point to a continuation of growth in much of the region, although 
activity in Mexico appears to have decelerat ed significantly following the third quarter’s 
outsized gain.  Headline infla tion continued to rise in em erging Asia, driven by energy 
and food prices, but remained below its earl ier elevated pace in Latin America.  The 
increase in food prices largely reflected the effects of advers e weather in several 
emerging Asian economies during the fourth quarter. 
 In China, incoming data point to continued strong  growth of real GDP in the fourth 
quarter.  Growth appears to be broad ba sed, with consumption, investment, and net 
exports all likely contributing positively.  In December, real  auto sales were 45 percent 
higher than their year- earlier level, and, more  generally, retail sales growth remained 
strong.  Over October and Nove mber, fixed-asset investment was 28 percent higher than 
the same period in 2008.  The value of nomina l exports and imports jumped considerably 
in December, although the levels of both remain about 5 percent below their pre-crisis peaks.  In the fourth quarter, the growth of exports outpaced that of imports, and, consequently, the trade surplus widened.  
Chinese authorities have recently taken significant steps to tighten monetary policy, as the rapid pace of economic growth has led to concerns about inflation and potential asset 
bubbles.  In particular, the People’s Bank of Ch ina raised required reserve ratios 50 basis 
points, to 16 percent for large banks and 14 percent for smaller banks, after holding these 
ratios constant for more than a year.  In addition, loan growth wa s subdued in the fourth 
quarter relative to the extraord inary growth earlier in the ye ar—in part owing to stricter 
enforcement of mortgage requirements and re strictions on lending to industries with 
excess capacity.  Headline consumer prices  rose rapidly from August through November, 
led by food prices, but nonfood prices also  increased.  Over that period, 12-month 
headline inflation climbed nearly 2 percentage points, from -1¼ percent to ½ percent. 
IV-34 
 
In India, economic activity appeared to pick up towa rd the end of the fourth quarter after 
a slow start, underpinned by st rength in the manufacturing sector.  Industrial production 
shot up 3.2 percent in November, buoyed by a strong rebound in consumer durables.  The 
purchasing managers index, which had been drifting down since May, jumped to 55.6 in 
December, indicating a faster pace of expansion.  Consistent with the domestic demand-
led recovery, the merchandise trade deficit has been widening since May, as demand for 
imports has outpaced that for exports. 
 A severe drought in the summer has led to  rapidly rising food pr ices and caused the 
inflation outlook to deteriorat e in recent months.  Consum er price inflation, which had 
been hovering above 10 percent, rose to 12.5 percent on a 12-month basis in November, 
while wholesale price inflation jumped more than 3 percentage point s, to 4.8 percent.

In the newly industrialized economies  (NIEs) ,1 recent indicators point to slowing 
growth in the fourth quarter from its rapid bounce back earlie r last year.  In Singapore, 
the advance estimate of fourth -quarter GDP indicated a cont raction of 6.8 pe rcent at an 
annual rate after two quarters of double-digit ga ins.  The contraction was mainly due to 
an output decline in the volatile biomedical s ector.  Other sectors, such as services and 
construction, experienced positive growth.  In  Korea, incoming data suggest slowing 
momentum in the economy; industrial produc tion in October and November was, on 
average, unchanged from its third-quarter level.  Howeve r, exports—particularly to 
China—surged in December, suggesting a possi ble pickup in growth toward the end of 
the quarter.  Exports picked up sharply in Taiwan as well during the fourth quarter, 
reflecting increased demand from both Asia and the advanced economies.  
 
Inflation has risen from very low levels across the NIEs, with Korea experiencing the 
largest increase to about 3 percent in December on a 12-month basis.  The increase primarily reflects rising food prices; core inflation, which excludes food and energy 
prices, moderated in recent months.  To date, central banks in the region have kept policy rates on hold.

In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN-4) ,2 economic growth during 
the fourth quarter was uneven across the region.  In Indonesia, industrial production 
accelerated on average in October and November, boosted by improved consumer 
confidence and export demand.  In Malaysia, it  continued to increas e but at a slightly 
slower pace than in the thir d quarter.  In Thailand, indus trial production has edged down 
since September amid subdued private invest ment and the suspension of 65 industrial 
projects at Thailand’s largest industrial z one by a court order on environmental grounds.  
Trade surpluses increased as exports rec overed, but edged down in November in 
Indonesia and Malaysia due to  a boost to imports from strengthening domestic demand 
and appreciating currencies.  
 
Headline inflation continued to rise in Tha iland and the Philippine s, driven mostly by 
energy and food prices.  In the case of Thaila nd, the increase in food prices was related to 
the implementation of a new price insurance sc heme that limits the government’s role as 
a supplier of farm products, and, in the case of  the Philippines, to a crop shortfall caused 
by floods in late 2009.  In Indonesia, headlin e inflation remained flat due to the 
strengthening of the rupiah and delays in increasing administered energy prices.  With 
year-end inflation in line with or below targ ets, central banks kept  policy rates on hold.

In Mexico , indicators of economic activity point to subdued growth in the fourth quarter, 
following the very rapid 12 percent pace seen in  the third quarter, which partly reflected 
the reversal of the H1N1 effects.  Consum er demand continued to be restrained by the 
still weak employment and tight credit conditions.  The overall economic activity 
indicator also points to weak performance in  October.  However, industrial production 
extended its upward trend, though at a somewhat  slower pace than in the previous 
quarter, and the auto sector continued to expand.  The trade balance turned positive in October and November, as exports rose faster  than imports.  Forward-looking indicators 
are also more upbeat; the purchasing managers index increased further for both manufacturing and services, with both now above the neutral level of 50.   
 Headline inflation continued to decline in D ecember, ending the year at 3.6 percent on a 
12-month basis and within the Bank of Mexico’s 2 to 4 percent target range.  The continued decline in inflati on reflected subdued domestic de mand and the appreciation of 
the peso.  It occurred despite a series of  price increases for administered goods and 
services that started in the second half of December, along w ith the 1 percent increase in 
the value added tax approved in the recent fisc al reform.  Separately, Agustín Carstens 
took office as the new governor of the Bank of Mexico on January 1.

In Brazil, real GDP grew 5.1 percent in the thir d quarter, as investment soared and 
private consumption remained robust.  Indi cations are that fourth-quarter activity 
remained strong.  Although November industria l production declined sl ightly, it was up 
3.7 percent on average in October and November relative to its thir d-quarter level, and 
auto production continued to climb in Decem ber.  The purchasing managers index for 
manufacturing was nearly 56 in December, a level consistent with further expansion.  
The recovery has been supported by rapid gr owth of government-directed credit and 
strong domestic demand, particularly for autos and appliances, which benefited from 
government tax breaks.  Import growth fa r exceeded export growth, reflecting strong 
domestic demand, causing the tr ade surplus to narrow.   
 Headline inflation came in at  4.3 percent in December on a 12-month basis, just below 
the midpoint of the central bank’s target rang e.  The central bank continued to intervene 
to mitigate upward pressures on the 
real, and international reserves  climbed to a record 
high of over $240 billion in mid-Janua ry, about 14 percent of GDP.

In Argentina , economic activity appears to have accelerated somewhat in the fourth 
quarter from its relatively flat performance over the first three quarters of 2009.  Growing 
Brazilian demand for automotive products and global demand for commodities 
contributed to an expansion of exports.  Inflation increased in the fourth quarter, 
reflecting a pickup in commodity prices a nd a move by government officials to bring 
official estimates in line w ith actual inflation rates.  
 On January 7, Argentine president Ferna ndez signed a decree ousting central bank 
Governor Redrado for misconduct.  Reportedl y, the governor’s refusal to transfer 
$6½ billion of the central ba nk’s reserves to the govern ment’s Bicentennial Fund 
triggered the action.  Created in mid-D ecember, the fund is intended to pay the 
government’s upcoming debt obligations.  To da te, Governor Redrado has refused to step 
down citing legal provisions, and a court orde r has halted the implementation of the 
decree.  The government’s attempt to use central bank reserves for debt repayments has further blurred the distinction between the assets of the government and those of the 
central bank.  The attempt triggered a U.S. c ourt order that froze the assets of Argentina’s 
central bank deposited at the New York Fed, worth $1.7 million.  The court order was 
later lifted on January 19.

In Venezuela , the currency was devalued in mid-Ja nuary and a formal dual exchange rate 
regime was announced.  The bolivar, which had been set at 2.144 bolivares per dollar 
since 2005, was moved to 4.3 bolivares per dollar.  Dollars will also be available at the subsidized exchange rate of 2.6 bolivares per dollar for certain imports and for debt 
payments.  The devaluation is expected to alleviate pressures on pub lic finances in the 
short term, as oil export revenues, priced in  dollars, comprise a large share of government 
revenues.  
 Inflation remained at more th an 25 percent over the past year, despite the weakening in 
economic activity.  Economic conditions appear  to have weakened further over the past 
few weeks, as a severe drought has prompted  the government to impose drastic rationing 
measures for electricity and water.  Electricity generati on in Venezuela is hydro-based, 
and reservoirs are expected to remain well below normal levels until the rainy season returns in May.

In Russia, economic activity rose at an annual ra te of 10½ percent in the third quarter 
following three consecutive quart ers of decline, led by the industrial and transportation 
sectors.  However, retail sales were flat in  the third quarter and remained sluggish in 
October and November, and unemployment al so ticked up in November.  Consumer 
prices rose 5 percent at an annual rate in  December, bringing 12-month inflation down to 
8.8 percent, the lowest rate in two years.  The central bank has continued to decrease 
interest rates to stem speculative capital inflows and the appreciation of the ruble.
