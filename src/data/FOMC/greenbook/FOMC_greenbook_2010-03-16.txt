1 This apparent bottoming out follows employment losses in 2009 that were significantly greater than 
suggested by the BLS’s initial estimates.  In the January employment report, the BLS incorporated the 2009 
benchmark revision to th e payroll survey, which sharply reduced the estimate of the level of employment in 
the first quarter of last year.  Additionally, the BLS used the revised data to recalibrate its estimates of 
employment changes for the months after the benchmark period.  The combination of these adjustments led to a cumulative downward revision to the level of private nonfarm employment of nearly 1.4  million by 
December.  In addition to the annual benchmark revision, in January, the BLS introduced new series on the workweek , aggregate hours, and average hourly earnings for all employees.  The trends in the series on the 
workweek and aggregate hours, which only go back to 200 6, are mostly similar to the trends in hours 
worked for production and nonsupervisory workers.  
2 Altho ugh the uncertainty surrounding this calculation is considerable, we estimate that private payroll 
employment would have posted an increase of roughly 75,000 in February in the absence of the snowstorms.  This estimate reflects the historical relationship between the payroll estimates and the number 
of individuals in the household survey who report not being at work due to bad weather —our best proxy 
for the effect  of weather on the labor market.  According to this measure, a bit more than 1  million people 
were not at work due to the weather in February , nearly one -half as many as the number recorded during 
the period that included the January 1996 blizzard.  In the household survey, workers who are with a job but not at work because of bad weather are counted as employed; thus, the unemployment rate was probably not affected much by the storms.  
       Note:  A list of abbreviations is available at the end of Part 2.  
 
II-1 Economic activity appears to have expanded at a moderate pace in early 2010.  B usiness 
investment in equipment and software seems to have picked up, consumer spending 
increased further in January, and private employment would likely have turned up in 
Febru ary in the absence of the snowstorms that affected the East Coast.  Moreover, 
output in the manufacturing sector has continued to trend up as firms have increased  
production to meet strengthening  final demand and to slow the pace of inventory 
liquidation.  On the downside, the recovery in the housing sector has  faltered , and 
nonresidential construction has weakened further .  Meanwhile, a sizable increase in 
energy prices has pushed up top-line consumer price inflation in recent months ; in 
contrast, core inf lation has been particularly soft. 
Labor Market Developments  
As best we can judge, the labor market seems to be bottoming out.1  Private nonfarm 
payroll employment fell only 25,000, on average, in January and February and , in the 
absence of the storms, probably would have risen last month .2  The average workweek 
for production and nonsupervisory workers fell back in February after tick ing up to 
33.3 hours in January—its highest level since early 2009—but the drop was likely due to the storms.

3 The continuing high level of initial claims , along with large numbers of unemployed individuals 
exhausting their regular benefits and shifting into emergency and ext ended benefits programs, has pushed 
up the total number of UI recipients to around 10½  million.  The recent data from the household survey also point to a bottoming out in the labor 
market.  After dipping to 9.7 percent in January, the unemployment rate held steady in February, and the fraction of workers on part- time s chedules for economic reasons 
remained below the levels of late 2009.  In addition, the number of new job losers as a fraction of employment continued to drop, while unemployment durations—as gauged by the average length of unemployment spells and the share of the unemployed who have been out of work for more than 26 weeks—fell back a bit from their historic highs in January.  T he labor force participation rate has inched up over the past two months.  
Nonetheless , on net, participation has fallen steeply since mid -2009 in response to the 
scarcity of employment opportunities; indeed, individuals’ perceptions of job availability 
from February’s  Conference Board survey remain quite negative. 
The message from other labor market indicators is  mixed .  After smooth ing through the 
volatility induced by storms and various reporting problems, initial claims have risen a bit 
since the January Greenbook.3  However, help -wanted advertising has risen noticeably of 
late, and readings on future hiring plans from the Manpower survey are up, on net, since 
the start of 2010.  In contrast, information from JOLTS—the layoff , job openings, and 
hiring rates —indicate s little recent improvement in labor market conditions.  Both the 
number of firms with hard- to-fill positions and hirin g plans as reported in the NFIB 
survey are also little changed since the end of last year.  Households’ expectations of 
future labor market conditions remain well above their lows from early 2009. 
We estimate that output per hour of all persons in the nonf arm business sector rose at an 
annual rate of 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009—the result of a surge in output

Industrial Production  
After increasing briskly in the second half of 2009, industrial production (IP) continued 
to expand, on net, in the early months of 2010.  IP shot up 0.9 percent in January , and 
indicators for February (including production worker hours and available product data ) 
suggest that total IP was little changed  as higher output at mines and utilities offset a 
decline in  manufacturing production that was, at least in part, due to the effects of the 
East Coast snowstorms.  In recent months, gains across industries have remained  broadly 
based:  The January reading of the diffusion index of three-month changes in manufacturing  IP indicated  that two -thirds of individual industries recorded increases in 
output relative to three months earlier.  According to the staff’s flow -of-goods system, 
recent production gains have reflected a pickup in final demand, both domestic and foreign, and efforts by firms to slow the pace of inventory liquidation. 
Capacity util ization in manufacturing rose to 69.2 percent  in January, 4 percent age points 
above its trough in June, but still some 10 percent age points below the longer- term 
average.  As a result , incentives for firms to expand production capacity are weak.   
Indeed, based on data for investment, business surveys, and physical measures  in some 
industries, factory  capacity is estimated to decrease 1  percent  in 2010 after declining 
1.2 percent  in 2009.4 
Production of light motor vehicles declined a bit in Febru ary after stepping up in January.  
Over the first two months of 2010, assemblies averaged roughly 7½ million units at an 
annual rate, an increase of ½  million units from the pace in the fourth quarter.  Production 
in February was held down somewhat by a disruption at Toyota, where a major safety recall led the firm to temporarily halt production and sales of several models in late January and early February.
5  Dealers’ i nventories of light vehicles continued to expand 
in the first two months of 2010, and days’ supply moved up to 63 days at the end of February .  Although days’ supply is currently slightly below the industry target of 
65 days, automakers appear cautious about the outlook for sales, and manufacturers’ initial assembly plans suggest that production will re main at an annual rate of about 
7½ million units in  the second quarter. 
                                                 
4 If realized , this two -year decline in capacity would far exceed the decline of 0.5 percent over 2003 
and 2004, the only other contraction since the series beg an in 1948. 
5 Toyota ’s suspension of production covered four  U.S. assembly plants  and lowered production 
230,000 units  at an annual rate in February.  Toyota is also planning some additional downtime through 
mid-April for inventory -control purposes .

Elsewhere in the transportation sector, output of commercial aircraft is likely being held 
down by the slowing of Boeing ’s production of 777 passenger plane s.   
 
 .  
 
. 
P
roduction in high-tech industries increased moderately in the fourth quarter and posted a 
solid gain in January.  In the fourth quarter, the output of communications equipment recorded its first quarterly increase in a year as telecommunications serv ice providers 
continued to increase capital expenditures in order to  boost cellular network capacity.  
U.S. computer spending surged in the fourth quarter, but this jump provided only a limited boost to domestic computer production because the increase in demand was concentrated in products that are primarily imported .  Meanwhile, exports of high- tech 
products rose in December and have been climbing rapidly since mid-2009. 
Upstream, d omestic semiconductor production has edged up, on balance, in recent 
months.  Microprocessor production has flattened out at a high level after surging in the 
middle of last year, but production of other chips and electronic components has 
increased  steadily.   More broadly, the global semiconductor industry, which slashed 
capaci ty during the downturn, has struggled to meet demand from downstream producers.  
As a result, prices have risen for some sem iconductor components, and the industry is 
spending heavily on new equipment, much of which is manufactur ed in the United States.  
Looking ahead, available indicators suggest that high -tech production will be supported 
by increased business spending in the coming months.  Surveys indicate that businesses 
are intending to replace aging equipment and have increased IT budgets for 2010.  W ith 
inventories of high-tech equipment already lean, any pickup in investment will likely lead to higher production.  That said, outside forecasters generally expect revenues for major U.S. information technology companies to only move sideways in 2010, which would be consistent with just a modest increase in production. 
Energy output has boosted IP in recent months.  As a result of unseasonably cold 
weather, utilities output jumped in Decem ber and rose further in January; for February, 
weekly electricity data point to another solid increase in the output of utilities .  In 
addition, weekly product data suggest that oil and gas drilling , which has risen sharply 
since mid -2009, moved up further in February and will boost the output of mined energy 
products for  the month. 
Outside of energy, motor vehicles and parts, aircraft and parts, and high- tech industries, 
production rebounded 0.9 percent  in January  after moving sideways in December.  Gains

were widespread across major market groups, as consumer goods, busi ness equipment, 
construction supplies, and materials each  increased about 1 percent.  The available data 
suggest that production in February was likely little changed , as a number of industries 
were negatively affected by last month’s snowstorms. 
The avail able indicators of near- term manufacturing activity point to moderate gains in IP 
in the coming months.  T he new orders diffusion index es from the national ISM survey 
and from the regional manufacturing surveys remain at levels consistent with a further 
expansion in production in the near term.  The three-month moving average of the staff’s 
series on real orders for durable goods (adjusted to exclude industries for which reported 
orders have little information content for predicting shipments) also suggests  moderate 
gains in the near future.  
Consumer Spending  
Consumer spending has continued to move up.  In total, real PCE rose a solid 0.3 percent  
in Januar
y after similar gains, on average, over the preceding three months.  The rise in 
spending in recent mon ths has been driven by sizable increases in outlays for a wide 
variety of goods, while real outlays for services have remained on a more gradual 
uptrend. 
On average, sales of new automobiles and light trucks were at an annual rate of 
10.6 million units
 in January and February, slightly less than in the fourth quarter of 
2009.  The softening was concentrated in the retail segment and appears to reflect , in part,  
the safety recall at Toyota, which led the firm to halt sales of eight models in late January 
and the first half of February.6  Smoothing through the effects of the Toyota 
suspension—as well as the unwinding of the “cash for clunkers” effects —we estimate 
that underlying consumer demand for light vehicles has been essentially steady  in recent 
months, consistent with the stability in  households’ assessments of car-buying conditions.  
Incentive programs were little changed in January and February; h owever, in early 
March, Toyota announced an aggressive incentive program to lure customers back into showrooms, a move that was quickly followed by other automakers. 
Household income looks less supportive of spending than at the time of the January 
Gree
nbook.  After incorporating the unemployment insurance tax records for the third 
quarter of 2009, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) lowered its estimates for wages and salaries in the second half of last year  by roughly $100 billion at an annual rate ; as a 
result, real DPI is now estimated to have risen just 1  percent  over the year as a whole, and 
even this sm all gain reflected a substantial boost from fiscal stimulus.   In January, real 
                                                 
6 Toyo ta estimated that the sales suspension reduced its sales by roughly 310,000 units at an annual 
rate in January and 240,000 units in February.  However, these estimates appear to cover only the recalled 
models and thus do not include any spillovers to other Toyota vehicles.

DPI fell 0.6 percent , dragged down by a large  increase in the BEA’s estimate of personal 
taxes, and the personal saving rate dropped to 3.3 percent , ¾ percent age point below its  
fourth -quarter average, but still almost 2  percent age points above its pre- recession level.7

ith equity prices having posted moderate gains and house prices holding steady in the 
four
th quarter of 2009, the ratio of household net worth to income was litt le changed after 
increasing appreciabl y over the prior two quarters.  A t the end of last year, the wealth -to-
income ratio stood close to its long-run average, but the loss in household net worth from 
mid-2007 to the end of last year wa s still equivalent to  nearly 1½ years of household 
income.  So far in 2010, equity prices have moved up modestly, on net. 
Housin
g 
The recovery in the housing market seems to have stalled .  Single -family housing starts  
moved sideways over the second half of 2009 and remained at an annual rat e of about 
480,000 in January.  Unusually bad weather apparently  depressed new construction in 
January (and likely did so again in February); this factor, along with the small positive 
gap between adjusted permits and starts in January, sugge sts that some improvement in 
starts may be in the offing once the weather returns to normal.  However, reports from 
homebuilders and our industry contacts suggest that activity in the new home market is being held down by the large number of distressed properties  on the market, new homes 
selling at prices  below building costs, and difficulties in obtaining  loans for land 
acquisition, development, and construction.  In the multifamily sector, starts in January were 18 percent below their  year-earlier level as tight credit conditions and elevated 
vacancy rates continue d to restrain activity.  
On the sales front, t he Census Bureau’s measure of new home sales agreements, which 
had posted sizable declines late last year, dropped a further 11  percent in January to an 
annual rate of 309,000 units—a record low for this series , which began in 1963.

7 The jump in personal income tax payments in January reflects the BEA’s incorporation of the 
Administration’s projection that net final settlements (final payments less refunds) on 2009 tax liabilities 
will rise sharply this spring; following its normal procedure, the BEA incorporated that projection in its estimates of the level of personal taxes in January and will carry a similar level of net final settlements in 
its monthly tax estimates through the end of 2010 .  The BEA’s estimates o f net final settlements are subject 
to substantial revision as information on actual payments and refunds is received.   
Meanwhile, sales of existing homes, which appear to have received a substantial boost 
last fall from the originally scheduled expiration of the homebuyer tax credit, fell considerably in December and January; pending home sales agreements also decreased  in 
January .

The slowdown in sales notwithstanding, housing demand is being supported by a number 
of factors .  Interest rates for conforming 30- year fixed -rate mortgages remai n very low by 
historical standards, and the recent news on house prices is likely contributing to a 
perception that real estate values are near their bottom.  The repeat- sales price index for 
existing single -family homes calculated by LoanPerformance was about unchanged in the 
fourth quarter of last year at a level 4  percent above its trough in April 2009.  Moreover, 
in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers for February, the number of respondents who expect house prices to increase over the next 12 months continued to exceed the number of respondents who expect prices to decrease. 
After moving down dramatically  through the end of last year, the inventory of unsold 
new homes remained at the  very low level  of 234,000 units in January.  However, 
measured relative to the slow pace of sales in January, the months’ supply of new homes moved back up to just above 9 months—only about one- fourth  below its peak last 
January .  More broadly, the vacancy rate for homes intended for owner occupanc y 
(which includes both existing and completed new homes for sale) edged up in the fourth quarter of last year, and , although significantly below its peak in 2008, it remains high 
relative to pre -crisis levels.  
Equipment and Software  
Real spending on equipment and software increased  at an annual rate of 18  percent  in the 
fourth quarter of 2009 and appears to have risen further early in the first quarter.  Purchases of high-tech equipment are apparently rising briskly, business outlays for 
motor vehicles seem  to be holding up after a sharp increase in the fourth quarter, and 
incoming data point to some firming in outlays on other equipment. 
Real spending on high- tech equipment and software increased at an annual rate of about 
30 percent in the fourth quarter, and the latest monthly data for manufacturers’ shipments and IP point to further gains in high-tech investment in early 2010.  While demand stemming from the replacement of existing equipment likely remains  a major driver of 
the step -up in high- tech investment , reports from major high- tech companies suggest that 
some firms may have moved beyond replacing aging capital to actually increasing capacity —for example, both Microsoft and Apple are in the early stages of building large 
data centers.  
Business purch ases of motor vehicles are also faring well.  Deliveries of light vehicles to 
rental car companies and other businesses continued to increase, on average, in January and February.  And although orders for medium and heavy trucks have fallen sharply since m id-autumn ( a swing that likely is related to the new environmental regulations on 
diesel engines that took effect at the start of this year), truck sales were little changed 
between November and January  after moving up, on net, over the preceding few months.

Real b usiness investment in equipment other than high tech and transportation posted 
another small decline in the fourth quarter, but the incoming data hint that an upturn may 
be under way.  Shipments and orders for this broad category of nondefense c apital goods 
have moved erratically in recent months, mainly because of swings in the volatile engine and turbines category.  Excluding engines and turbines, shipments rose modestly in January and stood nearly 1½ percent  above their average level in the fo urth quarter.   
Meanwhile, new orders have been on a steep uptrend since mid-2009 and now stand just below shipments. 
The recent step -up in investment spending is consistent with improvements in many 
indicators of business demand.  Business output rose robustly in the fourth quarter, and 
the February readings of the ISM and Philadelphia Fed business sentiment indicators were near the top of their ranges  for the past several years .  Meanwhile, the cost of capital 
has fallen sharply over the past four quarters , and corporate bond yields  are similar to 
those seen before the recession began.  H owever, c redit conditions for small businesses 
remain difficult, as a large number of NFIB survey respondents again reported having 
trouble obtaining credit in February . 
Nonresidential construction  
Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector generally remain bleak.  A fter 
folding in the latest monthly construction data, we estimate that real outlays on structures outside of the drilling and mining sector fell  at an annual rate of about 30 percent in the 
fourth quarter, and nominal expenditures dropped further in January .  The weakness has 
been widespread across categories and likely reflects the drag from rising vacancy rates, plunging property prices, and difficult financing conditions for new projects.  In addition, 
the current level of architectural billings is consistent with further declines in spending over the next six months, and the nonresidential construction industry has continued to shed workers. 
In contra st, real spending on drilling  and mining structures has picked up strongly in 
response to the rebound in oil and natural gas prices in the second half of last year.  
Spending was up about 70  percent  at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, and increases in  
the number of drilling rigs in operation and footage drilled suggest that spending will remain robust in  the first quarter.  Nonetheless, this pickup follows a massive decline in 
the first half of 2009, and spending still stands well below late 2008 levels. 
Business Inventories  
The pace of inventory liquidation slowed dramatically in late 2009.  Indeed, as measured 
in the NIPA, real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles were drawn down at an annual rate of less than $35 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with reductions of

  9 In the main, the positive inventory swing in the fourth quarter reflected a widespread slowing in the 
pace of liquidation, but it also was influenced by a sizable accumulation of wholesale stocks of farm 
products as a result of last year’s unusually large and delayed harvest.
10 We estimate that the four snow days in F ebruary had only a modest effect on real federal purchases 
in the first quarter because the vast majority of the federal workforce is outside of the geographic area hit by the storms. 
11 More recently, daily tax data indicate that individual refunds are ru nning well above year -earlier 
levels, mainly because of the expansion of refundable tax credits in the 2009 stimulus package.  
    
 
II-25more than $100 billion in each of the preceding two quarters .9 Inventory data for January 
are still incomplete, but the book- value figures for the manufacturing and wholesale trade 
sectors are consistent with a further small liquidation of real stocks early this year. 
Information from the staff’s flow -of-goods inventory system, which uses data on 
industrial production through January, also suggests that large-scale liquidations have 
substantially subsided.  According to this system, inventories outside motor vehicles were little changed in January, and  months’ supply decreased further .  In all, this months’ 
supply measure has reversed about one- half of its run-up from mid-2008 to mid-2009.  
Among market groups, months’ supply remains elevated for equipment, materials, and, to a lesser degree, construction supplies, while inventories of consumer goods and of business supplies appear low relative to demand.  Meanwhile, the number of supply 
managers who described their customers’ i nventories as too low in the manufacturing 
ISM survey for February continued to exceed by a wide margin the number of supply 
managers who described these inventories as too high. 
Federal Government Sector 
Real purchases by the federal government were flat in the fourth quarter, as a hefty 
increase in nondefense spending was offset by a decrease in defense spending, which can be volatile from quarter to quarter.  As for the current quarter, information from the Monthly Treasury Statement for January, along with our read of the Daily Treasury 
Statements for February , point s to little, if any, increase in real defense purchases.  
Meanwhile, nondefense purchases should be bolstered by ongoing stimulus- related 
spending and by hiring for the decennial census, which began in earnest in February and will continue through May.
10 
The deficit in the unified federal budget widened further in the first four months of fiscal year 2010.  Net receipts were about 10 percent  lower in the October to January period 
relative to the same period a year earlier, primarily because of the effects of continued 
weakness in taxable income as well as the revenue-reducing provisions of stimulus legislation.
11   On the spending side, outlays declined about 2 percent  in the first four 
months of the fiscal year relative to the same year -earlier period, mainly reflecting the 
substantial decrease in TARP -related outlays.  Excluding outlays associated with the

   12 The CPI excluding food and energy fell 0.1 percent in January, but we think the weakness in this 
index was exaggerated by a technical issue associated with the incorporation of updated expenditure 
weights; without that technical quirk, the core CPI would have been unchanged. 
II-29TARP, expenditures increased about 1 2 percent , boosted by both the effects of the weak 
labor market on low-income support programs (such as unemployment insurance and 
food stamps) and the spending from the stimulus package.  In all, the CBO now estimates 
that the stimulus package will cost $862 billion; by the end of February, about $340 billion of the stimulus funds had been distributed in the form of spending increases 
and tax cuts . 
In the Administration ’s Budget of the U.S. Government: Fiscal Year 2011, the OMB 
projected a deficit of $1.4 trillion in fiscal 2010, assuming current policies; under the 
President’s budget proposals, which included some additional stimulus , the deficit would 
reach $1.6 trillion.  T he CBO ’s latest projections of this year’s deficit are slightly lower 
than the OMB’s, though not materially different.    
State and Local Government Sector 
Real purchases by state and local governments held up reasonably well in the face of 
difficult fiscal conditions for much of 2009, but they fell appreciably in the fourth 
quarter .  Moreover, the incoming data suggest that these expenditures dropped further in 
early 2010, with considerable weakness in both employment and construction spending. 
At the state level, revenues continued to decline in the fourth quarter, although the 
hemorrhaging of revenues that took a heavy toll on the sector’s budgets for much of 
2009 seems to be ending. Indeed, according to T he Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of 
Government, total state tax collections fell “just” 4 percent  over the year ending in the 
fourth quarter of 2009, compared with average declines of 13 percent in the first three 
quarters of the year.  States will also continue to receive significant amounts of federal 
stimulus aid over the next several quarters.  Nonetheless, many are confronting budget gaps in the current fiscal year an d are dealing with significant challenges as they prepare 
their budgets for the 2011 fiscal year (which begins on July 1 in most states).  States are 
addressing their fiscal difficulties by paring expenditures, raising taxes, and drawing down reserve funds.  
Prices 
Although rising energy prices have continued to boost overall consumer price inflation, 
consumer prices excluding food and energy have been soft .  Overall PCE prices increased 
0.2 percent  in January and have risen at an annual rate of 2 ¼ percent  over the past six 
months.  C ore PCE prices were unchanged in January following increases of 0.1 percent 
in each of the preceding two months.

II-35an annual rate of only a bit more than 1 percent , as a wide var iety of  goods  and services  
exhibited persistently low inflation or outright price declines . 
C
onsumer energy prices increased again in January.  The PCE price index for energy rose 
almost 3 percent, led by a nearly 5 percent increase in gasoline prices.  In  addition, 
consumer prices for natural gas moved up 3½ percent , likely reflecting the effect  of cold 
weather on spot prices.  According to survey data through early March, gasoline prices 
have fallen, on balance, following their January surge. 
The PCE pric e index for food and beverages edged up 0.1 percent in January after 
posting small increases over the preceding three months ; even so, food prices in January 
were still 1½ percent below the level from a year earlier .  Spot prices of farm 
commodities have changed little since the January Greenbook. 
On a 12-month change basis, core PCE inflation slowed from 1¾ percent  in January 2009 
to 1½ percent  in January 2010, as a marked (¾ percent age point) deceleration in market -
based core PCE prices was partly offset by a sharp acceleration in nonmarket prices.  
Meanwhile, t he 12-month average of trimmed mean PCE inflation (as calculated by the 
Dallas Fed) has fallen 1¼ percentage points from a year earlier, highlighting the 
widespread nature of the deceleration in PCE prices .  Notably, housing services inflation 
slowed dramatically , likely because of  the poor state of the housing market , while 
inflation for other market-based services stepped down considerably, possibly reflecting 
the deceleration in labor costs.  A part from tax -induced increases in tobacco prices and a 
rebound in motor vehicles prices, prices for core goods also decelerated over the past 
12 months. 
Movements in survey measures of inflation expectations over the intermeeting period 
have been small.  Median near -term inflation expectations in the Thomson 
Reuters/University of Michigan survey ticked down 0.1 percent age point in February to 
2.7 percent , while median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years edged down 
0.2 percent age point, to 2.7 percent —near the lower end of the narrow range that has 
prevailed over the past few years.  According to the first-quarter reading of the Survey of Professional Forecasters, expected PCE inflation over the next 10 years held steady at 2.1 percent , and expected CPI inflation over the next 10 years edged up from a historic 
low to 2.4 percent .  The TIPS -based measures of inflation compensation 5 years and 5 to 
10 years ahead have both moved down somewhat since the January  Greenbook. 
At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for core intermediate materials has risen at a brisk pace in recent months .  However, despite these increases, the index in January stood only 
1 percent above its year -earlier level.  In contrast, commodity prices —though up steeply 
over the pa st year —have increased more slowly of late.  Since the January Greenbook,

Last year’s deceleration in h ourly compensation now appears to have been even sharper 
than had been indicated earlier.  Based on the revised data on labor compensation from 
the NIPA  (which were discussed in the “Consumer Spending” section) and updated 
estimates of hours worked, hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector is now 
reported to have edged down in the third quarter of last year, and we estimate that it increased at a subdued ½ percent annual rate in the fourth quarter.  For 2009 as a whol e, 
hourly compensation rose only ¾ percent , 1½ percent age points less than suggested by 
previous BLS estimates and more than 2 percentage points less than the increase recorded 
over 2008.  Given the limited increase in compensation and the sharp rise in productivity, 
unit labor costs are estimated to have plunged 4½ percent last year and the markup 
moved up further. 
Other measures of compensation costs have decelerated as well.  The employment cost 
index (ECI) for hourly compensation of private industry wor kers rose at an annual rate of 
1½ percent over  the three months ending in December, with the indexes for wages and 
salaries and for be nefits both posting small increases.  Over the 12 months of 2009, the 
ECI increased 1¼ percent , down from 2½ percent in 2008.  This deceleration was led by 
a noticeable slowing in wage gains , a sharp fall in nonproduction bonuses, and a drop in 
employer contributions to retirement and savings plans. 
The new BLS measure for average hourly earnings of all employees —now the main 
source data for the BEA’s estimates of wages and salaries  in quarters for which 
information from unemployment insurance records is not yet available—rose 0.1 percent 
in February to a level 1¾ percent  higher than a year earlier; over the previous 12 months, 
the increase had been 3½ percent .  As for the narrower average hourly earnings measure 
that covers only production and nonsupervisory workers, the 12-month change in 
February was 2½ percent , down from 3¾ percent  in February 2009.

 Domestic Financial Developments 
Overview 
Financial conditions remained  supportive of economic gr owth over the intermeeting 
period, despite economic data that were somewh at weaker than expected, on balance, and 
a temporary escalation in concerns about fiscal  strains in Europe.  Investors marked down 
the expected path of the federal funds rate , on net, over the period.  Nominal Treasury 
yields were about flat, and TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation declined.  
Broad stock price indexes increased, booste d by positive earnings news, while risk 
spreads on corporate bonds were little cha nged.  The expiration of many of the Federal 
Reserve’s special liquidity facilities on Februa ry 1 had no significant effects in financial 
markets.  Also, despite further tapering of  the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset 
purchases of agency debt and agency-backed MBS and the imminent completion of the 
program at the end of this month, MBS yiel ds were roughly unchanged.  Conditions in 
both the commercial and residential mortga ge markets remained strained, with 
delinquency rates rising further. Meanwhile , net debt financing by nonfinancial firms 
was roughly flat, as solid bond issuance was offs et by declines in commercial paper and 
C&I loans. Consumer credit expanded in  January for the first time in a year.   
Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
The expected path of monetary policy imp lied by futures market quotes moved lower, on 
net, over the intermeeting period.  Implied ra tes on Eurodollar futures contracts maturing 
around year-end decreased about 10 basis points, and those on contracts maturing in early 
2012 fell about 25 basis points. Although the outcome of the January FOMC meeting 
was largely in line with expectations, market participants reportedly read the statement’s 
characterization of the economic outlook as somewhat more upbeat than they had 
anticipated, and Eurodollar futu res rates rose a bit in response.  However, subsequent 
economic data were somewhat weaker than expected, on balance, leading investors to 
mark down the expected policy path.  The ch anges to terms for primary credit and TAF 
loans that were announced on February 18 resu lted in a small increase in near-term 
futures rates, but this uptick proved short li ved, as the statement and subsequent Federal 
Reserve communications—most notably the Chairman’s congressional testimony the 
following week—emphasized that the modifica tions did not represent a shift in the 
overall stance of monetary policy. 
Based on the staff’s usual term premium assu mption of 1 basis point per month, futures 
quotes currently indicate that the federal funds  rate is expected to rise above 25 basis 
points at the end of the third quarter of 2010 and reach about 1¾ percent by the end of 
2011. In contrast, quotes from the market for interest rate caps suggest that the most

III-3likely path of the federal funds rate—that is , the mode rather than the mean of the 
distribution—involves a later liftoff in the policy rate and was roughly unchanged over 
the intermeeting period.  The results of the Desk’s March pr imary dealer survey were 
about in line with those from the January  survey, with one-half of the respondents 
expecting the first policy rate increase to occur by the end of the year.   
Nominal Treasury yields were essentially  unchanged over the intermeeting period.  
Yields may have been supported by an easing of flight-to-quality demands with a modest 
reduction in perceived downside risks to th e economic outlook, broadly consistent with 
increases in equity prices and reductions in  implied volatilities on Treasury securities 
over the period. TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation moved down at all 
horizons, likely reflecting the weaker-than-expected incoming economic data and the 
publication of lower-than-anti cipated CPI figures.  Survey  measures of inflation 
expectations that were released during the pe riod also pointed to s light declines in both 
short- and long-term inflation expectations.  In addition, analysts re ported that supply 
pressures may have boosted yields on TIPS somewhat relative to their nominal 
counterparts. 
Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities 
Over the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserv e continued to taper its large-scale asset 
purchases. Cumulative Federal Reserve purchases  of agency debt securities and agency 
MBS reached about $171 billion and $1.22 trillion, respectively.  All purchases are 
expected to be executed by the end of March. 
On February 18, the Federal Reserve announced  an increase of 25 basis points in the 
primary credit rate, effective February 19, and a reduction in the typical maximum 
maturity for primary credit loans to overn ight, beginning on March 18.  These changes 
were made in light of recent improveme nts in financial market conditions.   
The Federal Reserve’s emergency lending f acilities continued to wind down with no 
apparent adverse effects on markets or inst itutions.  The expirati on of the AMLF, CPFF, 
PDCF, TSLF, and the temporary liquidity swap arrangements with foreign central banks 
on February 1 had no significant effect on fi nancial markets.  The final two non-CMBS 
TALF subscriptions took place over the intermeeting period and supported a large 
number of deals relative to recent subscriptions, as sponsors re portedly sought TALF 
support for deals that would otherwise have b een more difficult to bring to market.  At 
the mid-February CMBS subscription, $1.3 billion in loans colla teralized by legacy 
CMBS were extended, an amount about in line  with recent subscriptions.  The final TAF

III-5auction occurred on March 8, offering $25 billion in 28-day credit. The minimum bid 
rate for this auction was raised 25 basis points, to 50 basis points, consistent with the 
change in the primary credit rate.  The auction was undersubs cribed, with bids totaling 
just $3 billion, compared with $15 billion of maturing loans. 
On March 8, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced plans to expand the list 
of counterparties with which it can conduct reverse repurchase agreements to include 
domestic money market mutual funds.  The announcement elicited little price reaction. 
Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates 
Broad stock price indexes rose  about 4 percent, on net,  over the intermeeting period, 
boosted in part by favorable earn ings reports from the retail sector.  Bank equity prices 
slightly outperformed the broader equity markets.  Option-implied volatility on the 
S&P 500 index dropped back to pos t-crisis lows after ratche ting up early in the period on 
concerns about Chinese monetary  policy tightening and fiscal st rains in Europe.  Even so, 
the gap between the staff’s estimate of the e xpected real equity re turn over the next  
10 years for S&P 500 firms and the real 10-year  Treasury yield—a measure of the equity 
risk premium—remained well above its  average over the past decade.   
Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate 
bonds were little changed. As a result, sp reads on corporate bonds remained at their 
lowest levels since early 2008. Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-rated 
ABCP held steady at slightly above their pre-crisis levels. 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Earnings news was generally favorable, partic ularly in the retail sector.  Profits of 
nonfinancial corporations in the S&P 500 continued to rebound, with quarter-over­
quarter growth maintaining a double-digit pace  in the fourth quart er.  In contrast, 
financial corporations, in aggr egate, continued to post near-zero profits.  On balance, in 
the month ending mid-February, analysts agai n revised up their fore casts of earnings for 
S&P 500 firms over the coming year. 
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms has continued to improve, on balance, in recent 
months. The aggregate ratio of debt to asse ts for nonfinancial corporations moved lower 
again in the fourth quarter, wh ile the aggregate liquid asset ra tio rose a bit further to a 
new high of about 11 percent. Moreover, th e pace of nonfinancial  corporate ratings 
downgrades by Moody’s slowed again in the fi rst two months of 2010 and was below the 
pace of upgrades. Meanwhile, the six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial

III-9firms edged down in January and February to th e low end of its histor ical range.  The rise 
in the C&I loan delinquency rate moderated a bit in the fourth quarter, and the year-ahead 
expected default rate for nonfinancial fi rms from Moody’s KMV was roughly unchanged 
in February, although at a so mewhat elevated level. 
Business Finance 
In January and February, the pace of gro ss bond issuance by nonfinan cial corporations 
remained strong.  In contrast, commercial pa per outstanding conti nued to contract and 
C&I loans ran off steeply again. Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial firms was 
about zero over the first two months of 2010, consistent with firms’ weak demand for 
credit and banks’ tight credit policies. 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firm s was robust in the fourth quarter of last 
year. Meanwhile, equity retirements from cash-financed mergers rose sharply as two 
large deals in the pharmaceutical industry  were completed.  In addition, equity 
retirements from share repurchases are estima ted to have increased a bit from recent low 
levels. As a result, net equity issuance by nonf inancial firms, which had been positive in 
the first three quarters of 2009, turned negative in  the fourth quarter.  Since the turn of the 
year, gross public equity issuance has sl owed somewhat, while announcements of both 
new share repurchase programs and cash-financed mergers and acquisitions have picked 
up. 
Public equity issuance by financial firms declined in January and February following 
very strong issuance in December, when several large banks issued equity to facilitate the 
repayment of capital received under the TARP program.  Gross bond issuance by 
financial firms remained solid. 
Commercial Real Estate Finance 
The contraction in commercial mortgage debt  accelerated in the fourth quarter.  The 
dollar value of commercial real estate sales remained at a ve ry low level in February, and 
the share of properties sold at a nominal loss inched higher.  Property prices in December 
were about 40 percent below their 2007 peak s.  The delinquency rate on commercial 
mortgages in securitized pools increased to more than 6 percent in January, and the 
delinquency rate on commercial mortgages at commercial banks  deteriorated further in 
the fourth quarter. The per centage of delinquent constructio n loans at banks also ticked 
higher in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless,  commercial mortgage CDS index prices 
changed little, on balance, over the intermeeting period.

  1 Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 166 and 167, implemented by the GSEs on January 1, 2010, 
removed mark-to-market capital expenses imposed on a GSE when it purchases a loan from its MBS pools. 
As a result, the GSEs have a strong incentive to purchase delinquent mortgages from their pools to avoid 
the costs associated with forwarding monthly payments of principal and interest to MBS investors. 
III-13Household Finance 
Mortgage interest rates and sp reads were about flat, on net, over the intermeeting period.  
The average interest rate on 30-year conf orming fixed-rate mortgages stayed around 
5 percent, and its spread to the 10-year Treasury yield rema ined at the low end of its 
range over the past few years. Agency MBS yields were also little  changed, on balance, 
despite some volatility surrounding the initial announcements and subsequent 
information about Freddie Mac’s and Fa nnie Mae’s buyouts of delinquent mortgages 
from agency MBS pools.1 The tapering of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS purchases 
over the same period and the impending end of its asset purchase program seems to have 
had little effect on MBS yields to date. Howe ver, the high level of the Federal Reserve’s 
purchases and the relatively low level of mortgage originations have reportedly 
contributed to reduced liquidity in the MB S market, leading to a higher incidence of 
secondary market fails-to-deliver.  
Residential mortgage debt declined further in  the fourth quarter.  House price data for 
December were mixed:  The FHFA price i ndex decreased, while the LoanPerformance 
and S&P/Case-Shiller price indexes increas ed slightly.  Delinquency rates on prime 
mortgages continued to climb in January, and the number of delinquent FHA-backed 
mortgages topped 530,000 in December, up from 320,000 a year earlier. Consumer credit expanded at an annual ra te of about 2 percent in January, its first 
increase since January 2009. The three-mont h percent change in revolving consumer 
credit became a bit less ne gative, while the re spective change in nonrevolving consumer 
credit moved up to about zero.  Despite low a nd stable consumer ABS spreads, the pace 
of ABS issuance in the first two months of the year was somewhat below that in the 
fourth quarter, reflecting the very weak pace of consumer credit originations late last 
year. The spread of credit card interest ra tes over the two-year Treasury yield ticked up 
in January, while spreads on new auto loans declined slightly, on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  Delinquency rates on cred it card loans in securi tized pools and auto 
loans at captive finance companies remained  elevated in January but were down a bit 
from their recent peaks. 
Long-term mutual funds continued to rece ive sizable net inflows in January and 
February, largely driven by continued robus t inflows into bond funds.  Money market

III-15mutual funds, especially institutional funds, experienced further substantial net outflows, 
as yields paid by these funds remained extremely low.   
Treasury Finance 
During the intermeeting period, the Treasury issued about $325 billion of nominal 
coupon securities across the term structure.  The auctions were generally well received, 
with bid-to-cover ratios within their recent ranges.  Measures of foreign participation in 
Treasury auctions remained elevated, alt hough they have trended downward somewhat 
since late 2009. The Treasury also conducted the first 30-year TIPS  auction since 2001.  
While the yield at the auction was 7 basis poi nts above the when-issued rate prior to the 
auction, the bid-to-cover ratio was 2.45, and market participants generally characterized it 
as successful.   
In its quarterly refunding st atement, the Treasury announced that it expects nominal 
auction sizes to stabilize near current le vels, while noting that TIPS issuance would 
gradually increase going forwar d.  Following the passage of le gislation raising the federal 
debt ceiling, the Treasury began increasing the balance in the Supplementary Financing 
Account; this account now stands at $50 bill ion and will increase to $200 billion by mid-
April. Treasury market functioning was about unchanged over the intermeeting period.  The 
average absolute fitting e rror of the staff’s nominal Treasury curve—a proxy for 
unexploited arbitrage opportuni ties in the nominal Treasury market—declined slightly 
over the period, and fails-to-deliver in the Tr easury market remained low.  On-the-run 
premiums on the 10-year Treasury note increas ed slightly, while trading volumes in the 
nominal and TIPS markets were little changed on net.   
State and Local Government Finance 
Conditions in the municipal bond market showed  little sign of strain  despite the growing 
evidence of budget problems faced by many states  and municipalities.  Gross issuance of 
long-term municipal bonds rema ined solid in January and February, mostly driven by 
continued strength in new capital issuance.  In contrast, the pace of short-term issuance 
stayed subdued. The number of municipal bonds downgraded by Moody’s rose further in 
the fourth quarter, far outpacing the number  of upgrades, as a la rge number of small 
municipalities saw their ratings lowered. Ev en so, yields on long- term municipal bonds 
were about flat over the intermeeting period, and their ratios to yields on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities  were also roughly unchanged.

III-19Money and Bank Credit 
M2 decreased 8½ percent at an annual rate in January, reflecti ng in part a contraction in 
liquid deposits. Several inst itutions opted out of the FDIC’s Transaction Account 
Guarantee Program because of higher fees asso ciated with participation after the year 
end, reportedly driving depositors to transfer funds out of  transaction accounts and into 
alternative investments outside of M2.  In February, however , M2 expanded 8 percent at 
an annual rate, as liquid depos its resumed their growth.  Sm all time deposits and retail 
money market mutual funds contracted in January and, to a lesser extent, in February, 
while currency declined a bit in January but advanced notably in February.  Growth of 
the monetary base averaged 27½ percent at an annual rate in both months, as the increase 
in reserve balances resulting from the ongoing large-scale asset purchases more than 
offset the contraction in reserve balances asso ciated with the decline in credit outstanding 
under liquidity and credit facilities. 
Total bank credit contracted at an 11 pe rcent average annual rate in January and 
February. Banks’ securities holdings declined at a modest  pace in both months after 
several months of steady growth.  Total loan s on banks’ books continued to fall at a rapid 
pace.2  C&I loans again declined steeply, as sp reads of interest rates on C&I loans over 
comparable-maturity market instruments climbed further in the first quarter and 
nonfinancial firms’ need for external fina nce likely remained subdued.  Commercial real 
estate loans also posted s ubstantial declines.  Household loans on banks’ books 
contracted as well, in part because of a pickup in banks’ securiti zation of first-lien 
residential mortgages with the GSEs in Fe bruary.  The decline in consumer loans 
originated by banks was mostly associated w ith a big drop in credit card loans.  In 
contrast, other consumer loans—including au to, student, and tax advance loans—were 
about flat over th e two-month period.  
According to Call Reports, bank profitability remained low in the fourth quarter, as 
slightly improved profits at banks in the 25 largest bank holding companies were about 
offset by a sixth consecutive quarterly loss at al l other banks.  The better results at larger 
banks primarily reflected hi gher noninterest income.  Although the rate of banks’ 
provisioning declined somewhat in the fourth  quarter, provisions continued to be the 
most significant drag on earnings. Reduced provisions are consis tent with signs of 
stabilization in delinquency and charge-off rates for certain categories of loans, 
particularly credit card loans. 
 
 
 
III-20Call Report data also showed a continue d decline in unused loan commitments, 
consistent with industry commentary suggesting that banks have moved to trim credit 
lines. The further drop in industry assets last  quarter, combined w ith additional capital 
infusions from parent holding companies, boosted banks’ aggregate regulatory capital

 U.S. International Transactions 
Trade in Goods and Services 
The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $40.2 billion in December, from 
$36.4 billion in November , as a sharp rise in nominal imports outpaced an increase in 
exports. 
The value of exports of goods and services moved up 3.3 percent in December after 
increasing about 1 percent in November.  The Dec ember increase was fairly broad ly 
based  across product categories, with notable gains in industrial supplies, capital goods, 
and automotive products.  Half of the increase in industrial supplies was driven by 
chemicals, while most of the increase in capital goods was due to strong aircraft sales 
following a decline in the previous month.  Automotive products further added to 
increases that occurred  in October and November, which were driven by strong increases 
in sales outside of North America. 
In the fourth quarter, nominal exports jumped a robust 28½ percent at an annual rate, 
continuing to retrace the declines recorded in late 2008 and the first half of 2009.  The fourth -quarter increase was broad based across all major categories of goods and 
services .

 The value of imports of goods and services jumped 4.8 percent in December following a 
gain of 2.6 percent in November.  Imports of oil accounted for more than one-third of the 
December increase, reflecting  both higher prices and volumes.  Most other major 
categories of imports also recorded gains in December , with the exception of consumer 
products, which were flat. A notable contributor to the rise in capital goods was 
computer products and accessories, which added to strong increases in the previous two months.   
For the fourth qua rter, nominal imports rose  34¾ percent at an annual rate, about the 
same pace as in t he third quarter .  However, as with exports, these increases have 
reversed only a portion of the earlier steep decline.  The fourth -quarter increase was 
broadly based across major categories of imports.

P
rices of imported non-oil goods rose 0.6 percent in January, in line 
with their increases over the past five months.  The pickup was driven by higher prices 
for material -intensive goods.  Although prices for finished goods were flat, on net, prices 
for consumer goods increased slightly after several months of remaining unchanged. 
Oil.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics price index of imported oil rose 4.8 percent in 
January following a decrease of 1.4 percent in December.  Similar ly, the spot price of 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil rose about 5 percent in January to average $78.50 per barrel .  Spot WTI fell back a touch in February to average about $76.50 per 
barrel before rising once again to close most recently on March 9 at nearly $82.  Over the 
past 8 months, the spot price of WTI has generally traded between $70 and $80 per barrel. 
Exports.  Exported goods prices rose 0.8 percen t in January, a bit faster than  in 
December .  The increase largely reflected higher prices for material -intensive goods, 
which rose 1.8 percent.  Prices f or finished goods increased 0.3 percent, a step -up from 
the pace of recent monthly changes.  P rices for automotive products and capital goods 
pushed finished goods prices higher, more than of fsetting  declining consumer goods 
prices .

U.S. International Financial Transactions  
Since the previous Greenbook, we have received Treasury data on international financial 
transactions through January and partial custody data from FRBNY through early M arch.   
In several respects , U.S. financial flows have returned to their pre- crisis levels .  In 
particular, foreign official inflows, bank lending, and outflows associated with U.S. purchases of foreign securities have returned to near pre -crisis levels.  The one notable 
exception is foreign private purchases of U.S. corporate debt securities .  These purchases 
have declined steadily since mid -2007 and remain well below their pre- crisis level.  
 
F
oreign official inflows slowed a bit in January to $13 billion (see line 1 of the table 
“Summary of U.S. International Transactions”; see also the figure “Foreign Official Financial Inflows through January 2010”).

N
et official financial inflows in January also received a boost from a further $10 billion 
decline in outstanding drawings by foreign central banks on the Federal Reserve swap lines (line 2).  Drawings on the swap lines involve Federal Reserve purchases of foreign currency, which are recorded as an official claim on foreigners, and repayments of those drawings therefore generate inflows.  These swap lines, which were closed in February, had a balance of only $100 million at the end of January, down from a high of $583 billion in December 2008. 
 
W
hen swap line drawings were on- lent by foreign central banks, they were generally 
priced at a backstop or penalty rate.  As such, the reduction in drawings reflect a renormalization of funding markets.  Indeed, the small net bank lending abroad in January (line 3) reflects a return to a more normal pattern.

Private foreigners purchased, on net, $6 billion of Treasur y securit ies in January, in line 
with the pattern of net purchases prior to the crisis ( line 4a; see also the figure “ Private 
Securities Flows through January 2010”) .  These purchases reflected strong acquisitions 
of bonds and notes that were partly offset by reductions in bills  (not shown separately) – 
a pattern similar to that of official holdings .  Private foreign investors continued to show 
interest in U.S. equities (line 4d) in January but continued to sell, on net, agency (line 4b) and corporate bonds (line 4c).  This lack of interest in U.S. corporate debt can be attributed to several factors, including the structur e of U.S. issuance, a rebound in 
issuance by foreign firms, and an increase in general home bias on the part of foreigners.  These considerations are discussed further in the box entitled “Recent Weak Foreign Demand for U.S. corporations’ Debt Securities” in Greenbook Part I. 
U.S. investors purchased, on net, $18 billion of foreign securities in January, about the 
pace recorded for 2009 (line 5).  These purchases of foreign securities were concentrated 
in foreign bonds (line 5a), along with small net purchases of foreign stocks (line 5b).

Foreign Financial Markets 
The trade -weighted value of the dollar, as measured by the staff’s broad nominal index, 
has risen a little more than 1  percent since the January Greenbook, as th e euro fell 
5 percent against the dollar and the British pound fell 9 percent.  The dollar’s strength 
against the euro owed to disappointing euro- area data and the heightened focus on the 
risks posed by the fiscal situation in Greece and some other euro- area countries.  The 
appreciation against the pound owed to weak U.K. economic data, including sluggish fourth -quarter GDP and January retail sales and the first January budget deficit on record, 
as well as to concerns that a potential political deadlock after the upcoming elections could significantly hinder future deficit reduction.  The dollar was little changed on net against most emerging market currencies; although it appreciated against many currencies early in the period following reports that Chinese authorities were moving to restrain bank lending, this appreciation was largely reversed as data for emerging markets came in, on average, stronger than the market had expected. 
The large fiscal deficits in Greece and, to a lesser extent, in Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and 
Spain, coupled with questions about their ability and willingness to take meaningful steps to shrink their deficits, have led to elevated spreads on sovereign bonds yields relative to German bonds.  Greek sovereign bond spreads have been volatile and are currently just above 300 basis points, about 50 basis points higher than at the time of the January Greenbook.  Spreads of other peripheral euro- area countries over German bonds are 
down slightly, on average, over that period.  Last week Greece announced further plans to reduce its 2010 deficit, and EU officials stated that these plans put Greece “on track,” likely indicating that the EU will not take action to sanction Greece.  Sentiment was also aided by reports that EU countries were ass embling a plan to help Greece in the event it 
is necessary, reportedly involving potential purchases of Greek debt by quasi-national institutions in Germany and France or possible guarantees of some Greek sovereign debt.  After these announcements, the governm ent was able to successfully issue €5 billion in a 
syndicated debt auction.  Market estimates indicate Greece must finance €13 -€15 billion 
in maturing debt and deficit spending before the end of May. 
Yields on benchmark German government bonds have fallen about 15 basis points since 
the January Greenbook, as concerns about sovereign risk prompted flows from peripheral European countries into core countries.  Other major foreign sovereign benchmark yields are little changed.

Weak incoming data have pushed back market expectations for policy tightening by both 
the ECB and BOE.  Market-based measures of expectations for policy tightening in the United Kingdom and the euro area point to tightening in the first and fourth quarters of 2011, respectively, about two quarters later than at the time of the January Greenbook.  The Bank of Canada is expected to tighten late in the third quarter of this year, and the Bank of Japan is expected to remain on hold for the foreseeable future; both of these expectations are l ittle changed. 
Foreign equity prices are down, on net, although most of the decline took place shortly after the time of the January Greenbook following reports that Chinese authorities were acting to restrain bank lending and following the announcement of the Obama Administration’s proposal to place limits on the activities of big banks.  Japanese and euro-area equities are down roughly 3  percent, since the January Greenbook.  Emerging 
market equity prices are down less than 5 percent on average.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
Economic performance in the advanced foreign economies was mixed in the fourth 
quarter, with real GDP advancing sharply in Canada and Japan but rising only slightly in the euro area and the United Kingdom.  That divide appears to have persisted in the first quarter, as indicators point to continued rapid economic growth in Canada and moderate expansion in Japan but somewhat anemic growth in Europe.  Manufacturing PMIs and industri al-sector confidence indicators continued to rise in all major countries, spurred by 
rebounding global trade.  However, retail sales showed weakness recently in the euro area and the United Kingdom.  Furthermore, consumer confidence turned down in the euro area, as the turmoil over Greek debt depressed asset prices and raised concerns over economic prospects. 
Amid rising energy prices, 12-month headline inflation for January rose in all major 
countries but remained below their respective targets except in the United Kingdom, 
where an increase in the value-added tax helped push inflation to 3½ percent.  Excluding food and energy, inflation in the advanced foreign economies remained subdued.  All major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged.

In Japan , real GDP increased 4.6 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter according 
to the initial estimate, but growth was revised down from 1.3 percent to zero in the 
previous quarter.  The recovery continued to benefit from the rebound in global trade and showed signs of spreading through the economy.  Domestic demand, which had fallen since the first quarter of 2008, finally rose in the fourth quarter, as private and public consumption accelerated and private investment turned up.  
Recent indicators suggest that the Japanese economy  has continued to expand in the first 
quarter.  Real exports rose in January at a pace just below the fourth-quarter average, 
while real imports accelerated, pointing to a positive but moderating contribution of net exports to GDP growth.  Other January data suggest that the recovery continues to spill over to the domestic sector.  Industrial production rose 2.5 percent, the eleventh 
consecutive monthly gain; r etail sales increased 2.9 percent, the fastest growth in six 
years; and housing starts, which had fallen to a record low last August, continued to 
rebound.  In addition, more than half a million jobs were added in January, driving down 
the unemployment rate to 4.9 percent from 5.2 percent in December.  Furthermore, 
consumer and business confidence edged up during the first quarter.  In contrast, new car registrations fell for the second straight month in February and machinery orders slipped in January.

The 12-month inflation rate rose 0.4 percentage point in January, to negative 1.3 percent , 
but the so- called core-core inflation, which excludes both fres h food and energy prices, 
remained at negative 1.2 percent, the low est rate since records began in 1971.  
Preliminary data for February, available only for the Tokyo metropolitan area, suggest that deflationar y pressure may have eased a bit, and Japanese 1 2-month wage growth 
turned positive in January for the first time in 20 months. 
On February 18, the Bank of Japan left its policy rate near zero and repeated its 
commitment to overcome deflation and return to a sustainable growth path with price 
stability .  On March 2, the Japanese parliament advanced a record large budget for the 
next fiscal year.  The new budget includes increased transfers to households and local governments but also substantial cuts to public works projects. 
In the euro area , real GDP grew at an anemic annual rate of 0. 5 percent in the fourth 
quarter.  Import growth slowed more than export growth so that net exports made a 
1¼ percentage point contribution to GDP growth, but final domestic demand continued to

decline and inventory adjustment made a negligible contribution to growth.  Among 
countries, G erman GDP stagnated after two quarters of growth; Italian GDP retreated 
0.8 percent after one quarter of growth; and Spanish GDP declined 0.4 percent, a significant improvement over the previous three quarters. France was the one major 
country with strong growth at 2.4 percent. 
Other recent data als o suggest little near -term momentum in the euro -area economy.  The 
euro-area composite PMI has been about flat, on net, since November.  Continued 
improvement in the manufacturing PMI has been offset by declines in January and February in the services PMI, as the export -driven recovery in manufacturing has been 
slow to spread to the domestic economy.  Euro- area retail sales fell 0.3 percent and new 
passenger car registrations declined 8.5 percent in January, consistent with continued weak household demand. Consumer sentiment retreated in February amid deteriorating 
prospects for personal finances and the overall economy.  Euro-area industrial production 
declined 1.7 percent in December, but data for individual countries pointed to a rebound 
in January. 
Indicators for Greece since the last Greenbook point to worsening economic conditions 
and increasing fiscal strains.  Output fell 3 percent in the fourth quarter, economic 
sentiment turned down notably in January and February, and the purchasing managers’ survey stayed in recessionary territory for January.  Since last fall’s announcement of 
revised deficit projections of almost 13 percent of GDP for 2009, market sentiment toward Greece has turned sharply negative.  An ambitious 3-year consolidation plan presented in January called for budget cuts of 4 percent of GDP this year and 3 percent in each of the following two years.  In addition, as part of negotiations with the European Union related to the Stability and Growth Pact, the Greek parliament recently app roved 
further austerity measures, including lowering public sector wage costs and increasing a number of taxes.  Moreover, so far this month there have been additional indications that European aid could be made available to Greece, if needed. 
In February , 12-month inflation in the euro area eased slightly to 0.9 percent according to 
the flash estimate.  Core inflation, e xcluding energy and unprocessed food, was 
0.9 percent in January, the lowest rate in 10 years. The ECB kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1 percent at its February  and 
March meeting s but took further steps to unwind its enhanced credit support measures.  
The ECB announced on March 4 that it would return to variable- rate tender procedures in 
 
   
 
 
 IV-25
 
its three -month refinancing operations starting on April 28 but with allotment amounts 
aimed at “ensuring smooth conditions in money markets.”  The ECB said it will continue 
to conduct its main refinancing operations (of one- week funds), as well as its special one-
month operations, as fixed- rate tenders with full allotment as long as necessary, and at 
least until October 12.  The ECB has continued to implement plans to buy €60 billion worth of covered bonds ; by early March, it had purchased € 40 billion in such bonds.

In the United Kingdom , real GDP expanded at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the fourth 
quarter, the first quarterly increase since 2008:Q1.  Many analysts had expected 
households to bring forward consumption expenditures ahead of the expiration of the 
value- added -tax cut on January 1, 2010.  The rise in private consumption was modest, 
however, and was more than offset by a sharp drop in investment spending.  Inventories 
contributed nearly 2 percentage points to GDP growth, as the decline in manufacturers’ stocks slowed markedly .  Imports rebounded more strongly than exports, despite weak 
domestic demand  and the relatively low level of the pound, leading to a negative 
contribution from trade. 
Incoming data suggest that overall activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. 
The February readings of the PMIs for services and manufacturing were consistent with 
GDP growth at its historical average, and confidence indicators have more than retraced 
their year -end losses.  Moreover, the level of employment has been roughly stable in the 
second half of 2009. 
The nascent recovery remains fragile, however, as several sectors continue to stagnate. 
Construction orders were flat in the fourth quarter, and industrial production in December remained close to its nadir.  Investment intentions improved only marginally in January, while the volume of retail sales dropped nearly 2 percent.  However, net lending to 
individuals increased more than expected in January.

The 12-month change in consumer prices jumped to 3.5 percen t in January, prompting 
Bank of England (BOE) Governor Mervyn King to wri te an open letter to the c hancellor 
of the e xchequer , explain ing that headline inflation had exceeded the 2 percent target 
because of three factors: the ex piration of the temporary va lue-added -tax cut on 
January  1, 2010; the recent increase in oil prices ; and the effects of the sharp depreciation 
in sterling in 2007 and 2008.  The BOE judged that inflation is more likely than not to 
fall below target over the coming year as these “shor t-run factors wane and spare capacity 
builds.” 
The BOE completed its £200 billion asset purchase program at the end of January.  Gilts 
accounted for almost all (£198.3 billion) of assets purchased .  The BOE voted to keep the 
size of its quantitative easin g program unchanged in February and March but left the door 
open to further purchases should the outlook warrant it.

Real GDP in Canada rose 5.0 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter following an 
upwardly revised 0.9 percent increase in the third.  The strong growth was driven 
primarily by domestic demand, as private consumption, residential investment, and government expenditures all rose robustly.  In contrast, nonresidential fixed investment fell and inventory accumulation subtracted from growth.  Net exports contributed about 1½ percentage points to GDP growth.  Exports surged, boosted by strong gains in automotive exports; the rise in imports also was concentrated in automotive products.  
Acceleration in activity late in the fourth quarter, combined with a few positive indicators 
for the first quarter, points to robust near-term growth.  The pace of m onthly GDP growth 
increased over the fourth quarter, rising from an annual rate of 4 percent in October to 7.5 percent i n December.  The gains were widespread across industries.  Consumer 
credit, which remained relatively strong throughout the downturn, has accelerated lately, rising 7.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December.  
The Canadian housing market has continued to rebound forcefully.  Building permits 
have increased more than 80 percent from their February 2009 lows to a level near the average of the boom years of 2006 and 2007, and prices for new houses are increasing. 
The business sector continues to lag behind the household sector.  Manufacturing 
industrial production in December was only 2.7 percent above its June 2009 low and

remained more than 20 percent below its January 2006 peak.  Manufacturing orders, 
however, rose a robust 13 percent in December, and the Bank of Canada’s Business Outlook Survey indicates strong growth and healthy investment in 2010.  
Labor market conditions continued to improve in January, as total employment rose by 
43,000. Total hours of work also rose following a strong incre ase in December. The 
unemployment rate fell slightly to 8.3 percent in January. 
Consumer prices rose 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in January, up 
0.6 percentage point from December.  E xcluding food and energy , inflation  jumped to 
1.3 percent from  0.7 percent in December.  The increase in inflation was due to a rise in 
gasoline prices and a sharp increase in the prices of passenger vehicles, which were up 3.2 percent in the 12 months to January, the first 12-month increase since June 2007.   
At its March meeting, the Bank of Canada maintained its policy rate at 0.25 percent and 
reiterated its intention, conditional on the outlook for inflation, to keep rates at this level until at least the end of the second quarter of 2010.

Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Economic activity in the emerging market economies continued to expand in the fourth 
quarter , although performance was somewhat uneven across countries.  In emerging Asia, 
growth was robust in China, and several other economies, but stalled in Korea, and 
slipped into negative territory in India and Singapore.  Inventory restocking, along with 
increased domestic and foreign demand, appears to have supported activity for a number 
of countries.  Exports continued to pick up, although merchandise trade balances declined for some countries where strong domestic demand caused imports to outpace exports.  In 
Latin America, economic activity also remained strong, particularly in Mexico, where it 
was supported by continued expansion in manufacturing and exports to the United States.  However, the severe earthquake in Chile is having a negative impact on activity there. Although inflation has moderated a bit in parts of emerging Asia, headline inflation remained elevated in much of the emerging market world and moved up in Mexico and 
Brazil.  Adverse weather -related food price increases remain ed the key driver of inflation 
in most cases. 
In China , real GDP growth remained robust in the fourth quarter.  Recent indicators 
point to a continuation of strong growth in the current quarter.  The PMI  for the 
manufacturing sector edged lower to 52 in February, but still signals expansion.  Auto 
sales in January set a monthly record, with 1.7 million cars sold, up 126 percent from 
their year -earlier level .  Both imports and exports rose in January and February, keeping 
the average trade surplus over the two months about the same as in the fourth quarter.  
Authorities reported a $ 284 billion  current account surplus for 2009, down from 
$426 billion in 2008. 
In February, the People’s Bank of China raised required reserve ratios 50 basis points, to 
16½ percent for large banks and 14½ percent for smaller banks, the second increase this year.  Chinese authorities acted partly in response to an acceleration in bank lending in 
January and an upward trend in consumer price inflation since the middle of last year , 
although inflation edged lower in January.  In addition, the China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered banks to limit new lending to investment companies set up by local governments; these companies have been the primary vehicles by which local governments have funded stimulus spending.

In India , real GDP contracted in the fourth quarter, marking the first quarter of negative 
growth since 2004.  The contraction wa s primarily driven by a decline in agricultural 
output, which reflected a poor harvest following a drought in the summer.  Industrial production continued to grow at a strong pace in the fourth quarter.  T he merchandise 
trade deficit widened sharply in Dec ember , with a run-up in imports at the end of the 
year, but narrowed somewhat in January.  Recent indicators point to a continuation of 
momentum in manufacturing activity in the first quarter:  T he PMI for manufacturing 
shot up to 58½ in February, indicating the fastest pace of expansion since June 2008.      
Headline consumer price inflation continued to increase, reaching 15¼ percent on a 
12-month basis in January .  The rise in inflation primarily reflected  rapidly rising food 
prices.  However, more recent indicators point to a moderation of inflationary pressures from food prices.

In the newly industrialized economies  (NIEs) , real GDP growth slowed sharply during 
the fourth quarter in Korea and Singapore but rose in Taiwan and Hong Kong.1 
According to the advance estimate, growth slowed to less than 1 percent at an annual rate 
in Korea, partly reflecting frontloading of production into the previous quarter due to the 
lunar holiday in October. The rapid increase in fourth -quarter real GDP in Taiwan and 
Hong Kong reflected broad -based gains in both domestic and ex ternal demand .  In 
Taiwan, there was also a large contribution from inventory accumulation .  Recent 
indicators point to a continuation of recoveries in manufacturing and exports, with Singapore’s manufacturing sector appearing to be particularly strong. 
Headline i nflation in the NIEs has generally risen this year from very low levels.  Within 
the region, Korea experienced the largest increase in consumer prices—2.7 percent in 
February from a year earlier —largely reflecting rising food prices; core inflation, which 
excludes food and energy, has moderated in recent months.  To date, central banks in the 
region have kept policy rates on hold.

In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN-4) , real GDP grew rapidly in 
Thailand and Malaysia in the fourth quarter, reflecting a rapid  rise in inventories after 
several quarters of destocking.2 In addition, economic activity was b oosted by a new 
fiscal stimulus package and the recovery of private consumption in Thailand , and a 
continued increase in investment in Malaysia. Real GDP  in Indonesia and the Philippines 
expanded at a moderate pace, led by domestic demand.  Within the reg ion, indicators for 
the current quarter are only available in Thailand, where consumer confidence and 
exports continued to improve in January; industrial production declined after a spike in 
December , but remained above the average level of the fourth quar ter. 
Headline inflation in the region continued to rise this year on a 12-month basis.  C ore 
inflation is also following  an upward trend, amid an economic recovery, most notably in 
Thailand and the Philippines.  Inflationary pressures from food prices remained significant in Thailand, but eased elsewhere. Inflation generally remained below central 
bank target ranges, except in the Philippines .  In early March, Malaysia's central bank

In Mexico , real GDP gr ew at a strong 8.4 percent pace in the fourth quarter, led by 
surpri singly rapid expansion in the manufacturing sector , and an increase in exports.  A 
competitive exchange rate and a surge in demand for durable goods from the United 
States supported the rise in manufacturing exports.  However, growth in the services 
sector  remained subdued as still-weak employment and tight credit conditions weighed 
on consumer demand.  Incoming data suggest that the economy continued to expand in 
the current quarter, albeit at a slower pace. The PMI edged up higher in February for the 
services sector but decreased a bit for the manufacturing sector .  The trade surplus 
narrowed as imports rose more than exports. 
Twelve-month headline inflation jumped to 4.5 percent in January and increased further 
to 4.8 percent in February, above the 2- to-4 percent target range of the Bank of Mexico 
(BOM) .  The increase in inflation primarily reflected the effects of the recent  hikes in 
taxes and administered prices.  Unusual weather conditions also boosted prices of fresh 
fruits and vegetables.  In late February, Mexico's Foreign Exchange Commission— 
composed of officials from the BOM and the Ministry of Finance—announced a revival 
of the foreign exchange reserve mechanism that was in place during the 1996 -2001 
period. T he BOM will auction $600 million worth of put options to domestic financial 
institutions at the end of each month.  The owners of the options will have the right to sell 
U.S. dollars to the BO M in exchange for pesos at the previous day’s fix rate, whenever 
that rate in pesos per dollar is lower than its average over the previous 20 day s.  With this 
mechanism, the Mexican authorities aim to accumulate reserves on a gradual basis without putting too much pressure on the peso .

In Brazil , economic activity was strong in the fourth quarter, with industrial production 
and retail sales growing briskly.  Activity appears to have continued to expand in the first 
quarter, albeit at a more moderate pace. In January, industrial production was boosted by still-strong growth in output of consumer durables, which has benefitted from tax breaks introduced in response to the financial crisis.  Consumer confidence continued to rise.  The PMI for manufacturing declined in February, but remained in expansionary territory.  Although the government has begun to withdraw fiscal stimulus measures, government-directed credit continued to expand and reached 42 percent of total credit in January, up from 34 percent in September 2008.  The trade balance narrowed in January and February, with imports rising more than exports. 
Headline inflation increased to 4.8 percent in February on a 12-month basis, above the 
central bank’s inflation target of 4 ½ percent.  Central bank officials h ave expressed 
concern about inflationary pressures.  In late February, the central bank announced 
changes in its complex system of reserve and liquidity requirements that partially unwind the unconventional measures enacted in the fall of 2008.  There is policy uncertainty amid speculation that c entral bank President Henrique Meirelles might  leave his post to 
run for political office in the upcoming elections in October.
