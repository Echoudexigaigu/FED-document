 1 Government employment was little changed in the first quarter, as declines in state and local 
employment were offset by hiring for the decennial census. Temporary census hiring totaled 87,000 
through March, similar to the average pace seen for the 1990 and 200 0 censuses.  In th e 2000 census, the 
temporary workforce rose to 530,000 in May. 
2 We estimate that the February snowstorms depressed the change in private payroll employment in 
February by about 75,000 and boosted the change in March by a similar amount.  We also think that the 
0.1 hour decline in the av erage workweek for all employees in Febr uary—and its subsequent reversal in 
March—were due to the snowstorms. 
3 In the first quarter of this year, employment increases in the household survey (adjusted for updates 
to population estimates) averaged 450,000 per month, about 400,000 per month more than the employment 
gains in the establishment survey.  Large discrepancies are common; in the fourth quarter of last year, for example, employment in the household survey fell by 235,000 per month more, on average, than 
employment in the establishment survey.  We tend to view the establishment survey as the more reliable 
indicator of changes in employm ent at quarterly frequencies.                                                  
           Domestic Nonfinancial Developments
 
Note:  A list of abbreviations is available at the end of Part 2. Economic activity appears to have expanded at a moderate rate in the first quarter, as 
private final demand has strengthened furthe r and the pace of inventory liquidation has 
greatly diminished.  Consumer spending has increased solidly since the beginning of the 
year, and business investment in equipment a nd software appears to have posted another 
sizable gain last quarter. On the downside, activity in the housing market has remained 
lackluster since the middle of last year, a nd conditions in the nonr esidential construction 
sector generally remain bleak.  In add ition, budgetary pressures led to a further 
significant contraction in  state and local expenditures la st quarter.  Turning to other 
indicators of economic activity, industrial pr oduction advanced briskl y again in the first 
quarter, and labor market conditions impr oved, on net.  Meanwhile, both headline and 
core consumer price inflation have been soft in recent months. 
 Labor Market Developments 
The labor market is showing signs of a nas cent recovery.  After falling steeply through 
most of 2009, private nonfarm payroll empl oyment increased about 50,000 per month, on 
average, over the first quarte r of 2010—the first quarterly increase since the onset of the 
recession.1  With the average workweek also up last quarter, aggregate hours of all 
employees increased at an annua l rate of about 2 percent fo r the quarter, after declining 
6 percent in 2009.2  The upturn in private employment has been widespread across 
industries, as the three-mont h diffusion index in March move d above 50 for the first time 
since January 2008. 
Data from the household survey also point to a firming in labor market conditions.3 The 
unemployment rate held steady at 9. 7 percent throughout the first quarter—

   4 We estimate that the government’s hiring of census workers had minimal effects on the 
unemployment and participation rates in March. 
5 The snowstorms that hit the East Coast held down production in February, and the swing from a cold 
February to a warm March was a large drag on utilities output last month.  0.3 percentage point lower than the fourth-quarter average.4  Furthermore, the number of 
new job losers as a percent of household em ployment continued to drop, and the fraction 
of workers on part-time schedules for econom ic reasons has moved down, on net, since 
the end of last year. In a ddition, the labor force participa tion rate has increased over the 
past few months following sharp declines over the second half of last  year.  Nonetheless, 
finding a job remains very difficult, and unemployment durations—as gauged by the 
mean duration of unemployment and by the share of the unemployed out of work for more than 26 weeks—continued to rise. 
Other labor market indicators have improved somewhat in recent months.  The layoff rate 
from JOLTS remained on a downward trajectory  in February.  And, although initial UI 
claims moved up over the first ha lf of April, we think that at least part of that rise 
reflected seasonal adjustment difficulties  and the four-week average still remains 
modestly lower than at the end of 2009.  Vacancies, as measured by the job openings rate 
from JOLTS and the help-wan ted advertising index, have moved noticeably above their 
end-of-year levels. In addition, alternative measures of labor market slack, namely the number of small firms with hard-to-fill positions and households’ perceptions of job 
availability, have improved slightly, on balan ce, since the beginning of 2010.  To be sure, 
the hiring rate in the JOLTS has yet to s how clear evidence of a rebound.  However, the 
signal from hiring plans in the March NFIB survey was more optimistic than the one suggested by the hiring rate, as the fract ion of small firms planning to increase 
employment in the next three months exceeded the fraction planning to decrease employment for the first time since fall 2008.  Finally, households’ expectations of future 
labor market conditions, though only moving si deways in recent months, remained well 
above recession lows. 
 Industrial Production 
Industrial production (IP) continued to expand at a brisk pace last quar ter.  Despite only 
modest gains in February and March, total IP increased at an annual rate of nearly 
8 percent in the first quarter, while manufact uring output rose more than 6½ percent.
5 In 
addition, the production gains were widespread across i ndustries, with the March 
diffusion index of three-month changes in manufacturing IP reaching its highest level in 
almost seven years.  According to the staff’s flow-of-goods system, both foreign demand 
and a mild restocking of inventories contribut ed positively to output gains last quarter.

 6 Toyota suspended production at four U.S. assembly plants for one week at the beginning of February; 
a more limited production downtime occurred in late February and the middle of April.  
 Capacity utilization in manufacturing, at 70.0 percent in March, stood nearly 
5 percentage points above th e trough recorded last June but was still more than 
9 percentage points below its  1972–2009 average.  With the exception of the aerospace 
product and parts and the food industries, most  major industry groups continue to operate 
at rates of utilization well be low their historical averages. 
The production of light motor vehicles stepped up  to an annual rate of 7.4 million units in 
March after being held down in February by a recall-related susp ension of production at 
Toyota.6For the first quarter as a whole, li ght vehicle assemblies were at a pace of 
7.4 million units, 400,000 units above the fourth-quarter average, as automakers cautiously began to rebuild dealers’ inventorie s.  Indeed, the overall  stock-sales ratio—at 
59 days in the first quarter—was well below the industry target of 65 days.  Moreover, 
initial assembly plans for the second quarter indicate that light motor vehicle production 
will hold steady at first-quarter levels. 
Production in high-tech industries increased so lidly in the first quarter.  The output of 
semiconductors rose briskly, and gains were  widespread across chip types.  The 
production of comm
unications equipment acceler ated substantially, with export demand 
surging early this year. By contrast, the rate of increase in co mputer output slowed 
somewhat last quarter following a fourth- quarter leap in output fueled by consumer 
demand. Looking ahead, the available indicators point to a further expansion in the high-tech 
sector in the near term.  Orders received by North American factor ies for circuit boards— 
a key input into electronics of all kind s—stood well above shipments in February, 
suggesting that further production gains are in  train.  In addition, Intel recently noted 
clear signs of improving business demand for pe rsonal computers, as corporate customers 
have moved to replace their aging stocks.  Capital expenditure plans announced by major 
telecommunications service providers for this year also  suggest further support for 
computer and communications equipm ent production in coming quarters. 
Energy output rose at an annual rate of near ly 9 percent in the first quarter, reflecting 
increases in utilities output and in drilling activity.  Av ailable weekly product data 
indicate that energy output will contri bute little to IP growth this month. 
Production outside of energy, moto r vehicles and parts, aircra ft and parts, and high-tech 
industries—which accounts for roughly two-thir ds of total IP—acceler ated in the first

quarter.  Indeed, the nearly 7 percent annual rate of increas e was the larges t since late 
1999, and gains were widespread across all ma jor market groups.  In particular, the 
production of business equipment incr eased 16½ percent last quarter. 
On balance, the available indicators of near-term manufacturing activity remain quite 
positive.  The new orders diffusion index from the national ISM survey and the average of the new orders indexes from the regional surveys moved up in March to levels consistent with brisk increases in manufactur ing output in the sec ond quarter.  Moreover, 
the first readings on new orders for April, from the New York and Philadelphia surveys, 
both increased.  In contrast, the three-month moving average of the staff’s series on real 
orders for durable goods (adjusted to exclude  industries for which reported orders have 
little information content for predicting shipments) flattened out in February and suggests only moderate gains in the near future. 
Motor Vehicle Sales 
Sales of light motor vehicles jumped in Marc h to an annual rate of  11.8 million units after 
falling for two consecutive months.  This increase was likely due, in large part, to 
Toyota’s aggressive incentive program and the quick matching of these incentives by 
other automakers.
7  J.D. Power and Associates estimates that sales this month have been 
running below the March pace despite the r ecent improvement in consumer attitudes 
toward car-buying conditions and the continua tion of automakers’ generous financing 
incentives. 
For the first quarter as a whole, sales of light motor vehicles averaged about 
200,000 units above their fourth-quarter level.   
 
 
 .  Orders for medium 
and heavy trucks fell sharply, on net, in the first quarter, likely because of the new 
environmental regulations on diesel  engines that took effect at the start of the year.  Even 
so, truck sales in the first quarter were littl e changed from their modest fourth-quarter 
level. 
Consumer Spending 
Consumer spending has continued to rise at a solid pace so far this year.  Real PCE 
increased at an average monthl y rate of 0.4 percent in January and February, and nominal 
                                                 
7 After its major safety recall in late January and early February, Toyota ratcheted up financing and 
leasing incentives in March, and other automakers quickly followed suit.  More recently, several 
automakers extended and expanded these incentives for an additional month.

   8 While real outlays on motor vehicles surged in March, the recent increase in this category followed 
two months of sizable declines that reflected weaker spending on both new and used motor vehicles.  
 
 
 sales at establishments in the retail control category—which the BEA uses to estimate 
expenditures on most non-auto goods and food services—moved up r obustly again in 
March. Together, these data suggest that spending for the first quarter as a whole 
increased noticeably faster than the 2¼ percent annual rate in the sec ond half of last year. 
The recent spending gains have been especi ally pronounced for most non-auto goods and 
food services. Factoring in our estimate of pric es in March, increases in real spending in 
the control category averaged about ¾ percent pe r month in the first three months of this 
year—stronger than the already solid increases in the second half of last year.  Real 
spending on services continued to  increase at a moderate pace early this year, abstracting 
from the weather-related pickup in energy serv ices through February.  In contrast, outlays 
on new and used motor vehicles fell again in the first quarter.8 
Although the usual determinants of spending have shown some signs of improvement 
recently, they remain at generally lackluster levels.  For example, while equity prices 
have risen strongly since the start of the y ear, household net worth remains well below its 
pre-recession level and is likely a continue d source of restraint on spending.  Similarly, 
although wages and salaries picked  up earlier this year with the apparent stabilization in 
the labor market, real disposable income was fl at in February after a ½ percent decline in 
January that reflected a one-time jump in personal taxes.  Furthermore, banks have 
indicated somewhat greater willingness to le nd to consumers in recent months, which has 
likely provided some support to spending increa ses, but terms and standards on consumer 
loans remain restrictive.  (For more information, see the appendix on SLOOS at the end of the financial section.) Finally, as a sign that households  are still anxious about their 
economic prospects, consumer sentiment dropped back in early April and has changed little, on net, since the beginning of the year. 
 Housing 
The recovery in the housing market remains stalled.  Single-family housing starts edged 
up, on net, over February and March, but much  of this gain likely reflected delayed 
projects getting under way as weather conditions returned to normal.  The small positive 
gap between adjusted permits and starts in March suggests that we might see some 
further pickup in starts in April. Weather effects aside, new construction has not moved 
up much since last summer.  Activity has likel y been held down by builders’ difficulties 
in obtaining construction financ ing, by new homes selling be low construction costs, and 
by the large number of distressed properties on the market.  Multifamily starts have also

remained at a low level due to elevated vacancy rates and tight credit conditions for 
builders. 
The demand for new homes has been especially weak in recent months.  The Census 
Bureau’s measure of new home sales agr eements inched down further in February 
following a sizable decline in January.   
 
 
. 9  As the pace of sales has slowed, the inventory of unsold new homes has edged 
up after sharp declines last year.  Conseque ntly, the months’ supply of new homes moved 
back up above nine months in February—onl y about three months below its peak in 
January 2009.  Sales of existing homes, which are recorded at closing, also ticked down 
in February, but the increase in pending hom e sales in February suggests that resales 
might move up some as the homebuyer ta x credit expiration de adline approaches.10 
The softness in housing demand has persis ted despite a favorable level of housing 
affordability and an apparent stabilization of residential real estate values.  Interest rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have changed little in recent months and 
remain at levels that are very low by historical standards.  And, while the repeat-sales price index for existing singl e-family homes calculated by LoanPerformance edged down 
in February, its current level is 3 pe rcent above its trough in April 2009.  Looking 
forward, the early April reading of the di ffusion index for year-ahead house price 
expectations constructed from the Thomson Re uters/University of Michigan Surveys of 
Consumers remained markedly more positive th an it was last spring, with the number of 
respondents who expect house pr ices to increase about th e same as the number of 
respondents who expect prices to decrease. 
Equipment and Software 
Real spending on equipment and software c ontinued to rebound in the first quarter.  
Investment in both high-tech and transporta tion equipment advanced further, and the 
gains now appear to be spreading to ot her categories of cap ital goods as well. 
Real spending on high-tech equipment and softwa re appears to have increased at a solid 
pace so far this year, albeit less than the ga in of over 30 percent (annual rate) posted in 
the fourth quarter.  The recent increases in high-tech investment continue to be 
concentrated in computers and software.  The average level of nominal shipments of

 computers and peripheral equipment in January  and February was well above the fourth-
quarter level, which combined with falling prices implies strong r eal increases.  In 
addition, imports of computers increased bris kly in February, and IP for this category 
registered a solid gain last quarter. Moreover, Adobe, Oracle, and IBM reported 
substantial revenue gains in  the first quarter, which, t ogether with upbeat revenue 
estimates for other major software companies,  indicates another larg e increase in business 
spending on software last quart er.  In contrast, shipments of communications equipment 
in January and February were below their f ourth-quarter average, suggesting that the 
recovery in domestic busine ss outlays on communications equipment may have paused in 
the first quarter. Looking ahead, a number of major hi gh-tech companies have reported 
that business demand appears to be picking up fu rther, as firms continue to replace aging 
equipment and are starting to expand capacity with the construction of new data centers 
and the buildup of wireless networks. 
Real investment in equipment other than hi gh-tech and transporta tion, a broad category 
of capital goods that accounts for nearly half of the total outlays on equipment and 
software, appears to have turned up sharply in the first quarter after falling for more than 
a year. Excluding the volatile engines a nd turbines category, average orders and 
shipments of other equipment in January and February were each more than 2 percent 
above their fourth-quarter average. This, together with the re cent increase in the 
diffusion index for shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, suggests that the recovery in spending ha s now become more broadly based. 
The recovery in investment spending is consistent with the strengthening in many 
indicators of business activity.  Business output  likely posted its third consecutive gain in 
the first quarter, and the recent readings of the ISM and Philadelphia Fed indicators of 
business conditions have now moved above the le vels that prevailed during the recovery 
that followed the prior recession. Furthermore,  the cost of capital has fallen sharply over 
the past year, as corporate bond yields return ed to levels seen before the recession, and 
the April SLOOS reported that, for the first time in a bout three years, a majority of banks 
eased standards and some terms on loans to  large businesses.  In contrast, small 
businesses, which are more likely to depend on bank credit for funds, continue to face difficult credit conditions:  A relatively high fraction of respondents in the March NFIB survey still reported tighter credit conditions , while the April SLOOS  indicated that, on 
net, banks continued to tighten te rms on loans to small businesses. 
 Nonresidential Construction 
The nonresidential construction sector remain s on a downward track.  Real outlays on 
structures outside drilling and mining plunged throughout last year, and recent data on

 11 According to the latest SLOOS, banks continued to  report that they tightened policies further on 
commercial real estate loans. nominal expenditures through Febr uary suggest a further declin e in the first quarter.  The 
weakness has been widespread across categ ories and likely reflects the drag from  
elevated vacancy rates, low levels of prope rty prices, and difficult financing conditions 
for new projects.11  In addition, the most recent reading from the architectural billings 
index edged up but remained at a level consis tent with further declines in spending over 
the near term, and, smoothing through weather-induced sw ings, nonresidential 
construction employment continued to decline, though at a slower pace compared with  
the sharp falls early last year.  
In contrast, real spending 
on drilling and mining structures picked up strongly over the 
second half of last year in response to the rebound in oil and natu ral gas prices.  And 
increases in the number of drilling rigs in operation and in footage drilled suggest that 
spending continued to rise rapidly in the fi rst quarter, likely return ing to levels posted 
prior to the large swings in energy prices over the pa st four years. 
 Business Inventories 
The data in hand for the nonfar
m business sect or excluding motor vehi cles suggest that 
the pace of inventory liquidation moderated fu rther in the first quarter after slowing 
sharply in the fourth quarter of last year.  Moreover, information from the motor vehicle 
sector indicates that auto dealers adde d to their stocks in the first quarter. 
The staff’s flow-of-goods system also sugge sts that large-scal e liquidations have 
substantially subsided, and indeed, it shows a small uptick in inventories over the past 
three months.  Inventories appear  to be approaching comfortable levels relative to sales in 
the aggregate, although there is some divergen ce in inventory positions across industries.  
Months’ supply remains elevated (when meas ured at the current pace of sales) for 
equipment, materials, and, to a lesser degr ee, construction supplies.  By contrast, 
inventories of consumer goods (particularly motor vehicles), business supplies, and high-
tech goods appear low relative to demand.  Finally, the ISM index on customers’ 
inventories remained at a very low level in March, despite increasing from its record low in January; this reading implies that supply ma nagers in manufacturing continue to expect 
their customers to do some re stocking in the coming months. 
Federal Government Sector 
Real federal government purchases appear likely  to hold steady in the first quarter.  Data 
from the Monthly Treasury Statements thr ough March suggest that real defense spending 
edged down last quarter, reflecting a temporar ily slow rate of spend-out from the hefty

  12 The Treasury now estimates that th e expected losses from last yea r’s TARP transactions were less 
than originally anticipated, and, in March, it record ed a downward adjustment of $115 billion in outlays.  
13 Preliminary data collected by the Rockefeller Institu te, based on a sample of 45 states, suggest that 
the decline in state revenues lessened even further in January and February.  
 
II-27amount of budget authority available for these programs.  Meanwhile, nondefense 
purchases should be bolstered in the firs t quarter by stimulus-related spending.  
Although federal debt continues to climb steep ly, the deficit in the federal budget may be 
starting to stabilize following its significant de terioration over the last year or so:  The 
budget deficit in the first half of fiscal year 2010 was a little narrower th an in the first half 
of fiscal year 2009. In particular, receipts in the first quarter were up nearly 5½ percent 
relative to the same year-earlier period, even  though last year’s stimulus policies appear 
to have held down tax receipts this year more than last y ear; indeed, we think that the 
revenues excluding the effects of  stimulus tax cuts may have increased at a double-digit 
pace in the first quarter.  Total federal spending fell roughly $100 billion in the first 
quarter relative to a year ear lier, reflecting lower outlays associated with the Troubled 
Asset Relief Program (TARP).12 However, outlays excluding financial transactions rose 
15 percent compared with a year ago, due both to the effects of the weak labor market on 
low-income support programs and to the sp ending associated with the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  Through the end of March, the ARRA had 
boosted spending and had reduced taxes by a combined amount of about $370 billion, 
still less than half of the to tal $862 billion stimulus package. 
State and Local Government Sector 
State and local governments con tinue to struggle with sign ificant budgetary  pressures, 
and incoming data point to a sharp decline in  real expenditures by these governments in 
the first quarter. Real outlays on constructi on plunged at an average annual rate of 
18 percent in January and February. More over, state and local hiring continued to 
contract, as employment decreased at an average of about 25,000 per month in the first 
quarter. 
Nonetheless, there are some tentative signs that the fiscal st ress faced by states and 
localities may have begun to ease a bit.  The Census Bureau’s Quarterly Summary of 
State and Local Government Tax Revenue  indicates that local government tax receipts 
posted a strong increase in the fourth quarter relative to the same period a year earlier 
because of rising property tax collections. Furthermore, at the state level, the pace of 
revenue declines moderated noticeably.13  For the sector as a whole, total tax collections  
by state and local governments increased almo st 1 percent over the four quarters of 2009, 
the first four-quarter increas e in their total revenues si nce the third quarter of 2008.

   14 Although roughly one-third of the March increase in consumer electricity prices reflected a rebound 
in rates in the mid-Atlantic region following a February rebate, consumer electricity  prices were up in all 
reporting regions last month.  
 
 
 
II-29Looking forward, the National Conference of St ate Legislatures reports that 42 states 
project revenues in fiscal 2011—which will begi n on July 1 in most states—to rise above 
their level in the current fis cal year.  In addition, federal stimulus funds for states and 
localities continue to ramp  up, and municipal borrowing for new capital projects has 
remained solid at relatively low interest rates. 
 Prices 
Consumer price inflation has been soft recently.  Both headline and core PCE prices are 
estimated to have inched up 0.1 percent in March after no change in February.  This 
increase would put the rise in core PCE prices  over the past three months at an annual 
rate of only ½ percent. Taking a longer view, core consumer price inflation slowed to an 
estimated 1¼ percent over the 12 months ending in March, compared with 1¾ percent over the year-earlier period. In contrast, the 12-month change in the headline index 
moved up noticeably over the past year, to  2 percent in March, as energy prices 
rebounded. Survey measures of long-run inflation expectations have been fairly stable in 
recent months at levels slightly lo wer than those posted a year ago. 
After rising sharply into the be ginning of this year, PCE en ergy prices are estimated to 
have edged down in both February and March.  Retail prices for gasoline declined again 
last month, and consumer prices for natural gas moved down after being boosted by unusually cold weather in Janua ry and February.  However, these price declines were 
mostly offset by a sizable jump in c onsumer electricity prices in March.
14 Survey data 
through mid-April suggest that consumer prices for gasoline have declined again this month. The spot price of crude oil ha s swung widely since the March Greenbook but 
ended up slightly, on balance. However, the sp ot price of natural gas has declined more 
than 10 percent since the time of the March Greenbook, and this will probably push down retail rates for natural gas somewh at further in coming months.   
The PCE price index for food and beverages is  estimated to have risen 0.3 percent in 
March, reflecting a jump in the prices for fru its and vegetables.  Nonetheless, food prices 
in March remained nearly ½ percentage point below their year-earlier level.  So far this 
year, spot prices of farm commodities are up a bit, as small declines in crop prices have 
only partly offset increases in  prices for livestock products. 
As noted, PCE prices excluding food and ener gy decelerated over the past year, with the 
12-month change ending in March estimated to be ½ percentage point less than in the

II-36previous 12 months. Market-based core prices decelerated even more noticeably, 
increasing only about 1 percent over the 12 months ending in March, down 1 percentage 
point from the increase over the year-earlier period.  Furthermore, this deceleration has 
been widespread, with the 12-month changes in  prices for housing services, market-based 
services excluding energy and housing, core nondurable goods, and durable goods 
excluding motor vehicles all down rela tive to the year -earlier period. 
Measures of inflation expectations have held fairly steady in recent months.  In the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan pr eliminary survey for April, median year-
ahead inflation expectations edged up to 2.9 percent, while median 5-to-10-years-ahead inflation expectations were unchanged at 2.7 percent—a readi ng that is near the low end 
of the range observed over the past few year s.  Meanwhile, the TIPS-based measures of 
inflation compensation for both 5 years and 5-to-10 years ahead have both edged up 
slightly since the March Greenbook. 
Cost pressures from rising commodity prices are showing through to  prices at earlier 
stages of processing. The PPI for core intermed iate materials continued to rise at a brisk 
pace through February, and the 12-month change in this index was nearly 3 percent, 
compared with a small decline posted over the year-earlier period. Commodity prices 
have also extended their si zable rebound following their collapse in 2008.  Since the 
March Greenbook, the Commodity Research Bu reau spot price index of industrial 
materials has increased about 3 percent, while the Journal of Commerce  index of 
industrial materials has moved up 7 per cent; commodity prices increases were 
widespread but especially pronounced for wood products.   
Labor Costs 
Measures of labor costs decelerated sharply ove r the past year.  Compensation per hour in 
the nonfarm business sector increased only ¾ percent ove r the four quarters of 2009, 
down from a 3 percent increase ove r the four quarters of 2008.  As a result of this small 
increase in compensation and the outsized gain  in productivity last year, unit labor costs 
fell 4½ percent in 2009 after rising 1¾ percent in 2008. 
Average hourly earnings of all employees also  decelerated during the past year.  Over the 
12 months ending in March, this wage measur e increased 1¾ percent, down from an 
increase of 3 percent over the ye ar-earlier period.  In the firs t three months of this year, 
the average monthly increase in averag e hourly earnings was only 0.1 percent.

 Domestic Financial Developments
  
 Overview 
Ma
rket participants appeared to become more optimistic about economic conditions over 
the intermeeting period.  Better -than-expected news about the economy and generally 
favorable earnings reports pushed stock prices  higher while  corporate bond spread s 
narrowed amid improved credit quality.  Yields o n Treasury securities  moved up a bit, 
but the expected path of the federal funds rate edged down, on net , largely reflecting 
FOMC communications. The end of the Federal Reserve’s programs to purchase agency 
debt and agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS) e licited little  response in financial 
markets. 
Indicators of credit flow were mixed over the intermeeting period.  Corporate bond 
issuance was extraordinarily strong, and commercial paper outstanding increased.  However, bank loans to businesses and households continued to contract significantly.  Resp ondents to the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
indicated that, on balance, lending standards were little changed in the first quarter , but 
some terms on loans to businesses and households were tightened further and loan demand continued to weaken broadly. 
 P
olicy Expectations and Treasury Yields 
A
lthough investors seemed to read the incoming economic data as pointing to continued 
firming in economic activity, e xpectations for the path of monetary policy fell slightly , on 
net, over the intermeeting period, largely in response to Federal Reserve communications.  
Some market participants reportedly interpreted the retention of the “extended period” 
language and the lack of a comment on an exit strategy in the March FOMC statement as 
indications that the federal funds rate might stay in a low range for a longer period than 
was previously expected. Policy expectations also decreased in response to other official 
communications during the intermeeting period, including the minute s of the March 
FOMC meeting and testimony by the Chairman, which  were generally perceived to be 
somewhat less upbeat about the overall economic situation than had been expected . 
Futures quotes continue to suggest that investors expect the federal funds ra te to exceed 
25 basis points in the fourth quarter of this year and to reach 1½ percent by the end of 
2011. M arket quotes for interest rate caps provide information on the anticipated 
distribution of the federal funds rate at future dates, and these distributions suggest that 
investors’ assessment of the most likely level of the federal funds rate does not move 
above 25 basis points until 2011.  Results from the Desk's primary dealer survey suggest that dealers on average see about a 40 percent chance that the first policy tightening will

III-5occur before year-end, which is not inconsistent with our interpretation of the March 
survey. 
Yields on nominal Treasury securities increased slightly over the intermeeting period, 
with the 2-year and 10- year yields  up 7 basis points.  Yields were apparently boosted by 
greater confidence in the economic recovery as well as increased concerns about the 
fiscal outlook; but these gains were tempered, in part, by reactions to FOMC communications.  TIPS -based i nflation compensation also moved up slightly over the 
intermeeting period ; however, s urvey -based measures of longer -term inflation 
expectations were little changed. 
The spread of the 10-year swap rate to the 10 -year Treasury yield , which narrowed 
sharply in the fall of 2008 and has continued to trend down since then, dipped into 
negative territory during the intermeeting period.  Several factors appear to have 
contributed to the downward trend in the swap spread over recent quarters, including 
projections of elevated federal deficits , reduced demands for hedging private holdings of 
agency MBS , and declining risk premiums embedded in Libor rates . 
   Fed
 eral Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities 
Ove
r the intermeeting period, the legacy CMBS TALF program  expired with l ittle effect 
on related markets.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York requested term sheets by 
April 19 for any new -issue CMBS deal proposed for TALF financing; no term sheets 
were received.  AAA CMBS spreads to Treasury yields dropped substantially , on net , 
over the period but remain elevated relative to pre -crisis levels .  Also of note, the first 
multiborrower CMBS offering since 2008 was scheduled to be issued on April 22.  The deal was not designed as TALF -eligible, and, indeed, the AAA tranche priced below the 
TALF lending rate. 
The Federal Reserve’s programs to purchase agency debt and agency MBS came to an 
end in late March, with little apparent effect on markets. Agency  debt spreads and the 
Fannie Mae 30- year cur rent coupon spread were little changed , on net, over the 
intermeeting  period.  Failures to deliver in the agency MBS repo market have continued 
to come down, reportedly reflecting decreased purchases by the Federal Reserve, which 
has increased the supply of securities available to market participants.

III-7quarter earnings  reports .  Leading up to the earnings announcements, f inancial sector 
share prices outperformed the broader equity markets, but they retraced some of those 
gains following the SEC announcement of legal action against Goldman Sachs.  Option-
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index generally trended down over the intermeeting 
period but spiked on the SEC announcement.  The spread between the staff’s estimate of 
the expected real equity return over the next 10 years for S&P 500 firms and an estim ate 
of the expe cted real return on a 10- year nominal Treasury  note—a measure of the equity 
risk premium—narrowed a bit but remained above its longer-run average.  
Over the intermeeting period, yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds were little changed , 
leaving their sprea ds to yields on comparable- maturity Treasury securities slightly lower .  
Yields on speculative-grade corporate bonds declined about 30 basis points, and their 
spreads narrowed about 35 basis points.  The term structure of corporate bond spreads suggests that investors are expecting continued higher- than-average  default risk in the 
near term, but that the required compensation for risk-taking, a dominant influence in the 
movement of far -term spreads,  now stands near the lower end of its historical range.  
Spreads on A2/P2- rated commercial paper and AA -rated ABCP remained low . 
Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality 
Based on the initial spate of earnings reports and Wall Street analyst forecasts, the staff 
estimate s that p rofits for firms in the S&P 500 index rose about 10 percent at a quarterly 
rate in the first quarter .  This growth  reflects both a continuation of strong gains for firms 
in nonfinancial industries and an upturn in financial sector profits from recent rock -
bottom levels .  The first -quarter earnings of banki ng institutions have been well above 
analysts’ forecasts,  on balance, with the largest banks posting strong capital markets 
revenue and banks of all sizes reporting a decrease in loss provisioning.  Leading up to the earnings report ing season, revisions to analysts’ forecasts of year- ahead earnings for 
S&P 500 firms were , on balance,  positive. 
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms improved further over the past few months.  The ratio of aggregate liquid assets to total assets for nonfinancial corporations moved further 
into record-high territory in the fourth quarter, while the aggregate debt- to-asset ratio 
declined somewhat.  Upgrades by Moody’s of nonfinancial corporate bonds in the first 
quarter significantly outpaced downgrades, with more than one-third of the dollar value 
of upgrades coming from the auto sector.  With no bonds defaulting last month, t he six -
month trailing default rate for bonds issued by nonfinancial firms edged down a bit more 
in March  to the low end of it s historical range .  Earnings reports for some of the largest 
early -reporting banks suggest that delinquency rates on loan s held by those banks

Moody’s KMV model ticked down but remained elevated relative to its typical levels in 
expansionary periods.

Ove
rall, net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations turned positive in the first 
quarter after being negative in the second half of last year.  Gross bond issuance by 
nonfinancial corporations surged in March and remained robust in early April , and 
nonfinancial commercial paper increased significantly as well .  In contrast , C&I loans 
outstanding contracted again in March , reflecting both subdued demand and lending 
standards that only recently appear to have ceased becoming tighter . 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms picked up in March, boosted by str ong 
seasoned equity offerings, and has continued to be solid in April.  In the first quarter, 
equity retirements from share repurchases are estimated to have picked up, and equity 
retirements from cash -financed mergers decreased to still - robust levels, leaving net 
equity issuance negative in the first quarter . 
Gross issuance of corporate bonds by financial firms was very strong in March and has 
been s olid again in April.  Gross equity issua nce by financial firms has also picked up, 
but remained below its robust pace in  2008 and the first half of 2009. 
 Co
mmercial Real Estate Finance 
Cre
dit quality in commercial real estate markets continued to deteriorate over the 
intermeeting period.  The delinquency rate for securitized c ommercial mortgages jumped 
in March , although one large loan accounted for most of the increase; e xcluding that loan, 
the increase in the delinquency r ate last month was close to that in previous months.  The 
decline in outstanding commercial m ortgage debt in the fourth quarter of last year , nearly 
9 percent at an annual rate, was the largest in the roughly 60- year history of the series, 
and the available indicators suggest that another contraction in the first quarter is likely.  The volume of commercial property sales remained low, with roughly one- half o f sellers 
incurring  a nominal loss .  Commercial real estate prices continued to fall in the fourth 
quarter, while the Moody’s index of commercial real estate prices ticked up in December 
and January before falling again in February .  Nonetheless, indexes of commercial 
mortgage CDS prices ticked up not iceably over the intermeeting period , putting AAA -
rated tranches at their highest levels since mid -2008, in line with the overall reduction in 
financial market risk premiums .

III-13  Household Finance 
The
 average interest rate on 30 -year conforming fixed -rate mortgages rose about 10 basis 
points, on net, over the intermeeting period.  That increase was roughly in line with 
changes in yields on Treasury securities , suggesting that the completion of the Federal 
Reserve’s l arge-scale asset purchase program has not triggered a notable increase in 
mortgage funding costs. 
House price index changes were mixed but slightly negative , on balance, in January and 
February .  Delinquency rates for prime and subprime mortgages climbed further in 
Janua ry, while the number of delinquent FHA-backed mortgages topped 550,000 again in 
February , up from 350,000 a year earlier. 
Consumer credit, particularly revolving credit, remained weak in recent months, and 
consumer credit ABS issuance slowed in the first quarter, reflecting the persistently weak 
loan originations.  Consumer credit quality, however, continued to improve, with the latest data and anecdotes indicating slight declines in the delinquency r ates of most types 
of consumer credit.  Spreads of yields on high-quality credit card and auto loan ABS over 
yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities edged down to levels last seen in 2007. Spreads on new auto loans also declined appreciably over the intermeeting period.  
However, the spreads of credit card interest rates edged up again in February. 
Long -term mutual funds, particularly bond funds, received large  net inflows in March, 
while net flows to equity funds remained moderate .  In contras t, money market funds 
continued to experience sizable net outflows in the same month, as yields paid by these funds remained extremely low. 
 T
reasury Finance 
D
uring the intermeeting perio d, the Treasury issued about $200 billion of nominal 
coupon securit ies across the maturity spectrum.  Some of the auctions held before the end 
of the quarter, particularly those for 5- and 7-year notes, saw somewhat weak demand, and stop-out rates in these auctions were noticeably above when-issued rates.  However, the 3-year, 10- year, and 30- year auctions in the week of April 5 were better received, 
with strong bid- to-cover ratios and stop- out rates closer to when -issued rates .  The 
Treasury also conducted a 10- year TIPS reopening of $8 billion on April 5, which was 
met with robust demand.  The Treasury continued to ramp up its issuance of bills to 
finance increases in balances at the Federal Reserve under the Supplementary Financing Program; those balances reached the targeted level of $200 billion on April 15.

  1 The new accounting standards make it more difficult for U.S. banks to hold assets off balance sheet. 
Banks adopted the standards in the fourth and first quarters, and the cumulative effects were folded into the 
bank balance sheet data published by the Federal Reserve as of March 31. While all major loan categories 
were affected to some degree by banks’ adoption of FAS 166/167, the largest effect was on credit card 
loans on commercial bank balance sheets, which nearly doubled as a result. The largest 25 b anks brought 
all of their previously securitized credit card loans (nearly $300 billion) back on balance sheet, while 
smaller reporting banks returned all but $16 billion to their balance sheets. Banks also consolidated 
significant amounts of other consum er loans ($41 billion), C&I loans ($33 billion), and residential real 
estate loans ($27 billion).  In addition, the allowance for loan and lease losses increased $36 billion. 
III-15  State a nd Local Government Finance 
The
 municipal bond market remained receptive to issuers , despite continued concerns 
over the financial health of state and local governments.  Gross issuance of long- term 
municipal bonds remained solid, helped by continued stren gth in new capital issuance 
under the Build America Bonds program.  The pace of short- term issuance was 
seasonally slow.  Yields on long-term municipal bonds moved in line with those on 
comparable -maturity Treasury securities, leaving their ratios to long- term Treasury yields 
little changed. 
 M
oney and Bank Credit 
M
2 contracted moderately in March as the growth of liquid deposits slowed significantly , 
and retail money market mutual funds and small time deposits continued to contract sharply.  C urrency growth moved up to an annual rate of 6 percent, and staff estimates 
suggest that this reflects solid domestic demand and a pickup in overseas demand.  The 
monetary base contracted at an annual rate of  19 percent because of a drain in reserves 
associated with the increase in the Treasury’s balances under the Supplementary 
Financing Program.  
After the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 166 and 167, loans held on 
banks’ balance sheets increased about $450 billion, or 7 percent, at the end of the first quarter.
1 This amount was substantially less than initial industry estimates (some as high 
as $1 trillion), in part because FASB indefinitely deferred the date by which banks would need to consolidate certain bank -sponsored investment funds.  According to the results of 
a special question on the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, banks did not 
tighten their lending standards or terms in response to these accounting changes. 
After adjusting to remove the effects of the FAS 166/167 consolidations, bank credit fell 
about 5 percent at an annual rate in March.  The principal driver behind the decrease was core loans, which dropped 9 percent, with all major comp onents of core loans 
contributing to the decline .  Commercial and industrial loans fell sharply again  in March, 
continuing the streak of monthly declines that began in October 2008.  Commercial real

III-19estate loans contracted again in March, at roughly the same rate as in recent months.  
Residential real estate loans als o decreased further, though the ir rate of decline in the first 
quarter as a whole was somewhat less than the rate posted in the second half of 2009.  
Both credit card loans and other consumer loans declined in March.  Banks’ holdings of 
securitie s also contracted, as continued strong purchases of Treasury and agency debt 
securities were more than offset by sales and maturities of MBS and other securities. 
The steep decline in core loans during the first quarter is consistent with the further 
widespread weakening of loan demand and the continued tight supply conditions reported in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey conducted in April.  Although most banks reported that lending standards were little changed over the previous three months, if the 
responses are weighted by the share  of outstanding loans each respondent has in each 
category, the survey implies a small net easing of bank lending standards duri ng the first 
quarter, the first such net easing in more than three years.  However, this change likely 
reversed only a small amount of the previous cumulative tightening of standards, and banks continued to tighten some terms on loans to both households and businesses, on balance.

 1 The April 2010 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses and 
households over the past three months.  T he survey also included three sets of special questions.  The first 
set asked banks about lending policies regarding business credit card accounts for use by small firms.  The 
second set queried banks about the use of loan extensions on commercial real est ate loans.  The last set 
asked banks about the effects of new statements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on standards and terms.  This appendix is based on responses from 56 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Respondent banks received the survey on or after March 30, 2010, and responses were due by April 13, 2010.

     Appendix
  
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
The April 2010 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicated that 
most banks kept their lending standards unchanged in the first quarter,  but that moderate net 
fraction s of banks further tighten ed many terms on loans to businesses and households .  However, 
when each response is weighted by the bank’s share of outstanding loan balances in each major 
loan category , the April survey implied a small overall easing of lending standards in the first 
quarter , the first such easing in about three years.  Moreover, f or almost all loan categories for 
which the survey did indicate a further net tightening of credit standards, the fraction of banks 
that reported having done so edged down.  On balance, the April survey points to a small 
improvement in credit availability from banks, although the improvement generally appears to be 
limited to higher -quality borrowers.  The survey also indicated that loan demand generally 
weakened furthe r.1 
Most of the banks that reported having eased some lending policies in the April survey were large banks. 
2 A number of large domestic banks eased standards and some terms on commercial and 
industrial (C&I) loans to large and middle- market firms.  Br anches and agencies of foreign banks, 
which tend to lend to relatively large firms, also reported easing standards and terms on C&I 
loans, on net.  However, standards on C&I loans to small firms were roughly unchanged, and 
terms on such loans were tightene d further over the past three months.  Turning to lending to 
households, t hree of the respondent panel’s largest residenti al real estate lenders, which account 
for 40 percent of such loans on the books of domestic banks , reported that they had eased 
standards on residential mortgages  for prime borrowers or home equity lines of credit.  On net, 
large banks also accounted for an easing of standards on non- credit card consumer loans.  In 
contrast, m odest net fractions of large and other domestic banks continue d to tighten standards 
and terms on credit card loans over the past three months. 
Domestic survey respondents indicated that demand weakened further for all loan types.  A 
decline in demand for residential real estate loans was reported by a larger net fr action of 
domestic banks than in the January survey, but for other types of loans the net fraction s of banks

III-A-3that reported weaker demand  continued to wane.  In deed, branches and agencies of foreign banks 
reported an increase in demand for C&I loans, on net, over the past three months. 
 Lend ing to Businesses 
  Q uestions on commercial and industrial lending. On ba
lance, a small net fraction of banks 
reported easing their lending standards on C&I loans to large and medium- sized firms.   The 
previous survey in J anuary showed the first net easing of standards on such loans since the onset 
of the financial crisis in the summer of 2007.  While the net fraction of banks that eased  standards 
on these loans in the April survey increased only slightly, t he latest survey mark ed the first time 
since 2006 that banks reported ly eased standards in two consecutive quarters. However, 
standards likely remain quite stringent following  the prolonged and widespread tightening that 
took place over the past few years. 
Among domesti c institutions, l arge banks were responsible for the reported easing of standards to 
large r C&I borrowers.  None o f the smaller banks, which compose roughly half of the respondent 
panel, indicated that they had eased their standards on C&I loans to large f irms over the past three 
months.  On net, a small fraction of branches and agencies of foreign banks participat ing in the 
survey  reported easing standards on C&I loans.  These respondents tend to be subsidiaries of 
large global institutions and concentrate on lending to relatively large firms .  Large domestic 
banks also eased some terms on  C&I loans for large and middle -market firms , on net, as did the 
foreign branches and agencies.  On balance, the large domestic institutions mostly trimmed their 
pricing terms, including t he cost of credit lines and the spreads of loan rates over the ir costs of 
funds , while the branches and agencies eased each of the seven surveyed C&I lending terms , on 
net.  
When asked about changes in standards o n C&I loans to smaller firms, almost all domestic banks, 
regardless of size, reported little change. However, significant  net fractions of domestic 
institutions reported tightening terms on C&I loans extended to smaller firms.  This  reported 
tightening of terms was more prevalen t at smaller banks.   Notably, the net fraction of banks that 
had increased premiums on loans to riskier borrowers remained fairly elevated  in the April 
survey . 
According to the survey, competitive pressures , the economic outlook, and tolerance for risk in 
the C&I loan market were the three factors that exerted the greatest influence on banks’ C&I 
lending policies over the past three months.  In particular, domestic banks that eased their C&I 
lending standards pointed to increased competition from other banks or nonbank sources of credit 
as an important factor in their decision, a response c onsistent with the receptive financing 
conditions in the corporate bond market and reported changes in the lending stance of foreign institutions.  Also , about two-thirds of such banks cited a more favorable or less uncertain 
economic outlook.  O nly a few banks reported having eased lending policies in response to an 
increased tolerance for risk.  By contrast, b anks that tightened standards or terms on C&I loans

    3 Survey respondent s were instructed that for the purposes of the special question, a loan extension was 
to be defined as a modification of a loan at or near the end of the original term that extends the term of the 
loan, as opposed to a newly underwritten loan used to refin ance a maturing loan.  
    
   
  
    
    
 
   
  
   
   
  
   
   
 
  
    
    
   
 
  
   
   
 
  
    
    
    
  
   
   
   
     
 
 
  
      
 generally indicated that they viewed the economic outlook as less favorable or more uncertain 
and also reported further reductions in their tolerance for risk .   
Small net fraction s of banks reported that demand for C&I loans from large and middle- market 
firms and from small firms weakened further over the past three months.  The reported weakness 
in loan demand was concentrated at smaller domestic banks, while large domestic banks reported 
little change in demand on net.  A moderate net fraction of foreign banks indicated that demand 
for C&I loans strengthened over the same period.  Nearly all of the domestic respondents that 
reported weaker demand cited borrowers’ reduced need to finance plant and equipment 
investment, and large majorities also indicated that demand for inventor y and accounts receivable 
financing declined .  Among the domestic banks that reported increased demand for C&I loans, 
the most commonly cited reasons were increased need s to finance inventories and accounts 
receivable, as well as a pickup i n mergers and acquisitions.  About half of those banks also 
reporte d having seen a shift of demand to their bank from other sources of external finance.  
  Spec ial ques tions on credit card loans to small firm s.   Th
e April survey included a set of 
special questions that asked domestic banks about standards and terms on credit cards for use by 
small firms.  A majority of respondents indicated that their standards for approving such business 
credit card accounts are currently tighter than the longer -run avera ge level that prevailed before 
the crisis.  In addition, significant net fractions of respondents to these special questions indicated 
that their banks had tightened their terms on business credit card loans to small firms—for both 
new and existing accounts—over the past six months. 
  Qu estions on commercial real estate lending. Wit
h fundamentals in the commercial real estate 
(CRE) sector remaining weak , a significant number of domestic banks, on balance, continued to 
report having tightened standards on CRE loans .  However, this net fracti on was considerably 
smaller than in the January survey.  As in the previous survey, domestic banks reported weaker 
demand for CRE loans, on net.  However, in the latest survey , the net fraction of banks reporting 
weaker demand moved below 10 percent for the first time since the financial crisis began.  In 
contrast, branches and agencies of foreign banks reported no change in CRE lending standards, 
on balance, and a small net fraction of these respondents experienced an increase in demand for 
CRE loans.  
   Spec
ial question on the use of CRE loan extensions. In respons
e to a special question , sizable 
fractions of both domestic and foreign respondents reported having increas ed their use of CRE 
loan extensions over the previo us six months.3 A few  banks reported having reduced their use of 
loan extensions during that period.  The beginning of the six-month period that this special

(October 30), “Prudent Commercial Real Estate Loan Workouts,” 
www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/2009/SR0907.htm . Wit
h regard to loans secured by residential real 
estate, most banks reported essentially no change in their  standards on prime and nontraditional 
mortgages  over the past three months.  A few of the largest banks eased standards for prime 
mortgages , while a roughly comparable number of the remaining banks indicated that they had 
tightened standards on such loans. A handful of large banks also contributed to the first net 
easing of standards on home equity lines of credit since the question was first asked in January 
2008, a change that may reflect the stabilization in home prices since the middle of last year.  
Compared with the January survey, a more sizable fraction of bank s indicated that demand for 
prime mortgages weakened over the past three month s, a result that is consistent with the weaker ­
than- expected readings on home sales during the first quarter. Fairly large ne t fractions of banks 
also reported that demand for home equity loans weakened over the survey period. 
Questions on consumer lending.   On balance, d omestic banks reported tightening their lending 
standards and terms for credit cards, but their lending stan ce toward  other consumer loans eased. 
A small net fraction of banks reported having tighten ed standards for credit cards, and moderate 
fractions reported having reduced credit limits and increased spreads of interest rates charged on 
outstanding credit ca rd balances .  The further tightening of standards and terms on cred it card 
loans, however, did not carry over into  other consumer loans , as small net fraction s of banks 
reported having eased standards and reduced spreads for such loans.  Moreover, t he net fraction 
of banks that reported an increased willingness to make consumer installment loans increased 
again, putting this indicator of credit availability  near the upper end of its range over the past 
decade. As in recent quarters, a moderate net fraction of respondents reported weaker demand for 
consumer loans of all types.

 U.S. International Transactions 
 Trade in Goods and Services 
The
 U.S. international trade deficit widened to $39.7 billion in February, from $37 billion 
in January, as a rise in n ominal imports outpaced a small increase in exports. 
The value of exports of goods and services moved up 0.2 percent in February after 
decreasing by about the same amount in January.  The February increase was fairly broad 
based across product categories with the exception of agricultural goods and consume r 
goods, both of which fell back slightly.  Capital goods rose in spite of falling aircraft and 
computer sales, driven by a large increase in machinery and semiconductors .  Automotive 
products moved up, though only partially reversing a sizable decline in January . 
On average in January and February , nominal exports increased  10¼ percent at an annual 
rate.  The increase reflects the quarterly arithmetic of a sharp jump in December, as the level of exports in February was almost unchanged from the December level.

 The value of imports of goods and services increased 1.7 percent in February , undoing a 
similar sized decrease in January .  Imports of oil accounted for more than one-third of the 
January decline, reflecting lower volumes, but only about a tenth of the February uptick, 
as volumes rebounded but prices fell .  Services imports recorded a large increase 
reflecting royalty payments associated with  broadcast rights for the winter Olympic 
games .  Capital goods rose as strong computer imports more than offset falling aircraft 
sales , and industrial supplies and consumer goods also moved up.  There was a notable 
decline in automotive products driven by sharply falling imports from  outside of North 
America.  
For the first quarter, nominal imports rose 13 percent at an annual rate.  However, as with 
exports, the increase is wholly reflected in the quarterly arithmetic of a sharp increase in 
December, with the level of imports in February actually coming in lower than t hat 
recorded in December.

ces for imported non-oil goods fell 0.2 percent in March because of 
a sharp drop in natural gas prices, while c ore import prices  rose 0.3 percent.  Within core 
imports, prices for material -intensive goods rose 0.7 percent in March, t he same pace as 
in February.  After declining in February, prices for finished goods were little changed in March, as f alling prices for automotive products and capitals goods (excluding computers 
and semiconductors) offset rising  prices for consumer goods. 
As measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), core import prices rose 5 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, as prices for material -intensive goods rose almost 
16 percent at an annual rate.  Overall, prices for finished goods were little changed, as slightly higher prices for consumer goods were offset by lower  prices for automotive 
products.    
Oil.   The BLS  price index of imported oil rose 4 percent in March after  a decrease of  
1.4 percent in  February.   The spot price of West Texas  Intermediate (WTI)  crude oil  
followed a broadly  similar  pattern , dropping  2½ percent in  February before increasing  
about 6 percent to average just over $81 per barrel in March .  Thus far in April, spot WTI  
has continued to edge higher, closing most recently  on April 20 at over $83.  The  
modestly higher oil prices may reflect a more  optimistic  outlook regarding  the global  
economic activity and, in particular, the prospects  for stronger oil demand in developed 
economies .

Exports.   Prices of exported core goods  rose 0.9 percent in March following Februa ry’s 
0.5 percent decline. This  pattern largely  reflects  movements in prices for agricultural  
products, which fell 3.8 percent in February and increased 2.1 percent in M arch.  In 
addition, after a 0.4 percent drop in February, prices for industrial supplies increased 
1.6 percent.  As in February, prices for finished goods were  flat.  
I
n the BLS data, p rices of exported core goods rose 7½ percent at an annua l rate in the 
first quarter, largely because of higher prices for material -intensive goods.  Non­
agricultural industrial supplies experienced the largest increase.  Prices for all major 
categories of finish ed goods were also up in the first quarter.

 U.S. Current Account 
The U
.S. current account deficit was $462 billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of 
2009, $53 billion wider than in the third quarter (revised) and the second consecutive 
quarter of widening deficits since the low reached in the second quarter of 2009.  The widening resulted primarily from an increase in the trade deficit. In addition, the su rplus 
on investment income decreased as profits earned on foreign direct investment in the United States recovered strongly from a dip in the third quarter and increased more than those on U.S. direct investment abroad. 
IV-9 
U.S. International Financial Transactions 
Since the March Greenbook, we have received balance of payments data for the fourth 
quarter of 2009, Treasury (TIC) data on U.S. international financial transactions for 
February,  and partial and confidential data on custody accounts at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York (FRBNY) through mid-April.  The data show that acquisitions of U.S. Treasury securities by foreign official institutions remain strong and that foreign official net purchases continue to provide the major share of net financial inflows.   
 
In 
February, foreign official net purchases of U.S. Treasuries picked up to nearly $30 
billion following two months of relatively small inflows (see lines 1a and 1b of the table “Summary of U.S. International Transactions”).  
 
 .  Custody data from FRBNY suggest 
particularly strong official inflows for March, including the largest acquisition of U.S. agency securities since mid -2008, and similar strength thus far in April.  This strength 
runs counter to news reports in recent months of slowing official inflows.  Such reports often point to the unadjusted TIC data, particularly for December and January, and the lower share of foreign participation in Treasury auctions in February and March (not shown).  However, official institutions often use private foreign entities to purchase securities, and these purchases would not be recorded as foreign official in the published TIC data.  Confidential adjustments to TIC data for this effect using daily custody data from FRBNY yield the stronger inflows reported here.  Furthermore, while foreign participation in Treasury auctions has declined, the FRBNY custody data confirm that foreign officials are nonetheless acquiring substantial amounts of Treasury securities.   
 
For
eign private net purchases of U.S. securities continue to be mixed, although stronger 
overall in February than in January.  Private foreign investors, mainly in Asia, made unusually large purchases of Treasury securities in February (line 4a).  In addition, foreign purchases of equities returned to a strong pace in February after a somewhat slower January (line 4b).  But private foreign acquisitions of agency securities remained fairly flat, and foreigners continued to sell U.S. corporate bonds, on net, as discussed in the previous Greenbook (lines 4b and 4c).  In banking, strong growth in gross positions, led by continued recovery in the RP market, ne tted to a small outflow (line 3).  
 
U.S
. investors slowed their pace of acquiring foreign stocks and long-term bonds in 
February (line 5).  For foreign stocks, this is a continuation of a slowdown from the fourth quarter.  However, we also received additional data for the fourth quarter of 2009 showing that U.S. investors purchased almost $100 billion of foreign negotiable CDs and 

  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
   
  
 
 
 
   
   
 
   IV-10
 
other short-term securities (included in line 10).  Therefore, the slowdown in long- term 
securities purchases may reflect more of a shift in instrument preference rather than an 
overall decline in U.S. demand for foreign assets. 
Turning to the fourth quarter-balance of payments data, U.S. direct investment abroad 
(line 6) was healthy, driven by strong retained earnings.  Retained earnings also boosted foreign direct investment in the United States (line 7), although they were offs et by 
declining inflows from intercompany debt.  But most strikingly, recorded net financial inflows fell far short of the recorded current account, resulting in a sizable $70 billion statistical discrepancy for the quarter and a $225 billion discrepancy for 2009.  This positive statistical discrepancy indicates some combination of under recorded net 
financial inflows or over recorded net imports of goods and services and other transactions measured in the current account balance. 
Since the balance of payments data were published, we also received derivatives data for 
the fourth quarter.  They show a decline in gross outstandings and a record net inflow of $21 billion (line 8).  (By convention, we show the headline numbers of the published balance of paym ents in the attached table, but all else equal, the derivatives data should 
narrow the fourth- quarter statistical discrepancy by $21 billion).

  Foreign Financial Markets 
Asset prices in most foreign financial markets appeared to reflect growing confidence 
that the global recovery is gaining momentum, particularly in emerging market 
economies.  Equity indexes rose in most countries, implied volatilities remained low, and 
emerging -market risk spreads generally declined.  However, despite the European 
Union’s announcement that it was negotiating a substantial package of financial 
assistance for Greece, Greek sovereign debt remained under severe pressure. 
The trade -weighted value of the dollar, as measured by the staff’s broad nominal index, 
has decli ned ¾ percent since the March Greenbook, as gains against the euro and yen 
were more than offset by declines against the Canadian dollar and most emerging market 
currencies.  The dollar appreciated 1 percent versus the euro, which was buffeted daily by 
news about Greece, and nearly 4 percent against the yen.  But the dollar depreciated 
2½ percent against the Canadian dollar, which was supported by Canada’s solid recovery and by rising commodity prices.  Late in the period, the Bank of Canada dropped its 
“conditional commitment” to keep policy rates unchanged until July, which supported the 
Canadian dollar.  Chinese authorities did not allow the renminbi spot exchange rate to fluctuate meaningfully against the dollar.  There are, however, widespread expectati ons 
among market participants that China will soon let the renminbi appreciate, particularly in light of China’s very strong GDP data for the first quarter, and the dollar depreciated 
against most other currencies in emerging Asia.  Of some note, the Monet ary Authority 
of Singapore revalued its currency about 1½ percent after strong first- quarter GDP data. 
The dollar depreciated more than 2 percent against the Mexican peso and the Brazilian 
real. 
Despite promises of financial support by euro- area countries, spreads of Greek sovereign 
debt over German debt began to rise again in the second half of March.  In early April, ten-year spreads rose above 400 basis points, and one-year Greek government bond 
yields shot up to more than 7 percent.  These spreads fel l after the April 11 
announcement by the European Union of a potential assistance package of up to

€45 billion to be funded by bilateral loans from euro- area countries and by the IMF. 
However, as it became clear that parliamentary approval for the aid wo uld be required in 
several potential donor countries, including Germany, spreads on Greek sovereign debt 
rose again, reaching record highs as the period ended.  On net since the March 
Greenbook, the ten-year spread of Greek debt over German debt has risen 210 basis 
points.  The debt spreads of most other “peripheral” euro-area countries only showed a 
modest response to the gyrations in Greek debt, with the exception of Portuguese debt 
spreads, which rose 80 basis points over the period.  Fitch cut Portugal’s sovereign rating 
and the EU warned that the Portuguese government may need to enact further fiscal cuts 
to meet its deficit goals. 
Reflecting widespread optimism that the global recovery is well under way, headline 
equity indexes rose in many industrial countries (Greece was one exception).  Equity 
prices also generally rose in Latin America, emerging Asia, and, particularly, in Eastern Europe.  Share prices in China declined slightly, likely affected by the Chinese 
authorities’ efforts to slow the growth of credit.  EMBI spreads declined in all regions: 
the Greek situation did not lead to a widespread pullback from risk.  Ten- year sovereign 
yields in Germany and other “core” euro -area countries were little changed on balance, as 
were U.K. and Japanese yi elds.  However Canadian and Australian ten- year yields rose 
about 20 and 30 basis points, respectively, reflecting stronger economic growth and firming expectations of future policy tightening.

  Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies 
Recent indicators in the advanced foreign economies suggest a continued divergence in 
the pace of recovery, with a strong performance in Canada, a moderate expansion in Japan, and a more sedate rebound in Europe.  Canadian household spending continues to grow at a solid pace, and the contribution of external demand is positive.  Japanese trade is rebounding further and business confidence is improving, but other recent indicators have been mixed.  In Europe, PMIs and other indicators point to a pickup in the pace of manufacturing production; however, household spending is lagging markedly, and consumer sentiment remains subdued.  The Greek debt crisis intensified during the intermeeting period and, in mid -April, euro- area member st ates announced a plan to 
provide financing aid to Greece if necessary, in coordination with the International Monetary Fund. 
The recent increase in commodity prices is pushing up 12-month headline inflation rates 
across the advanced foreign economies.  However, core inflation performance has 
remained more subdued, with the exception of the United Kingdom.  All major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged since the time of the March Greenbook. In addition, the Bank of Japan doubled the siz e of its three -month fixed- rate loan facility, 
and the European Central Bank announced that it would extend its special collateral rules beyond the end of 2010.  In contrast, in its April 20 meeting, the Bank of Canada dropped its conditional commitment to  keep policy rates unchanged through the end of this 
quarter.

In  Japan , real GDP rose  3.8 percent in the  fourth quarter, 0.8 percentage point lower than 
reported in the preliminary  release.  Incoming indicators suggest that the recovery  
continued in the first quarter, led by exports.  In February, real  exports rose at a robust  
1.1 percent monthly pace, just marginally below the fourth- quarter average ; however, real  
imports  continued to accelerate, rising 1.8 percent, indicating that  the recovery is  
gradually spilling over to the domestic sector.  In addition, consumer sentiment continued 
to improve, car sales reached a five -year peak  in March, and the ratio  in February  of 
active job openings to applications edged up further.  T he Bank of J apan  (BOJ)  Tankan 
index, an important measure of business confidence, improved in March for the fourth consecutive quarter.  According to the  BOJ Senior  Loan Officer Opinion Survey, demand 
for bank loans by individuals and firms increased in the first quarter.  Other s indicators, 
however, have softened.  In February, the monthly index of real consumer spending was  
flat, industrial p roduction fell, and machinery orders declined.   
IV-24 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 IV-25
 
The 12-month inflation rate edged up in February, to negative 1.1 percent , and core 
inflation  (excluding food and energy prices ) also increased.  On a monthly seasonally 
adjusted basis, headline prices rose 0.4 percent and core prices edged up 0.1 percent, the 
first monthly increase since September 2008.  Yet, much of February’s outcome in headline inflation was attributable to an increase in gasoline and other retail energy prices, and preliminary data for the month of March, available only for the Tokyo 
metropolitan area, suggest that prices resumed declining, although at a more moderate 
pace than throughout 2009.  In addition, the government ’s decision to eliminate public 
high school tuition fees is estimated to shave  about 1/3 percentage point off the 12-month 
inflation rate in the current quarter. 
On March 17, the  BOJ took some modest steps to extend monetary policy  easing out the  
yield curve, by doubling  the size of a loan  facility to  20 trillion yen ($222  billion) .  
Financial market reaction to the news was negligible.  Thus far, the facility,  which was  
set up in December and  makes available three -month loans at a fixed interest rate of  
0.1 percent  against a broad range of collateral, has contributed to slightly lower short-
term interest rates.   On March 24, the Japanese parliament approved the budget for the  
2010 fiscal  year, in line with the government proposal announced last December, with  
spending of 92.3 trillion yen ($1 trillion).  This  new budget, which calls for increased 
transfers to households  and local governments but also for substantial cuts to public  
investment, is  expected to result into a moderate increase in the deficit and to provide 
further stimulus to the economy.

In the euro area , real GDP growth in the fourth quarter was revised down to an annual 
rate of 0.2 percent.  Private investment fell 5¼ percent, and both private and government 
consumption also declined.  Import growth slowed more than export growth, allowing net 
exports to make a 1 percentage point contribution to GDP growth.  I nventory adjustment 
contributed ½ percentage point to growth.  
Recen t economic indicators show strength in manufacturing but suggest a subdued pace 
of overall activity .  In January, euro-area industrial production posted an impressive gain 
of 1.6 percent, and it surpassed expectations again in February, growing 0.9 percent .  In 
February, the trade balance of the euro area registered a €2.6 billion surplus, compared 
with a €9 billion def icit in January, as seasonally adjusted exports rose 2.7 percent while 
imports rose 1.5 percent.  The composite PMI rose above expectations in March, reflecting ongoing improvement in the manufacturing PMI and a recovery in the services PMI, which had edged down in February.  In contrast, real retail sales fell in both January 
and February, consistent with continued weak household demand.  Mor eover, while the 
business climate index and overall economic sentiment index continued to improve in March, the consumer sentiment index was flat after retreat ing in February .  Labor market

conditions remain weak. In February, t he unemployment rate ticked  up to 10 percent, 
compared with  a low of 7.2 percent in early 2008. 
Twelve-month euro- area headline inflation  moved up to 1.4 percent  in March, from  
0.9 percent in  February .  Core inflation, excluding all  food and energy, edged up to 
1 percent in March .  Energy inflation accelerated in March to 7.2 percent, from  
3.3 percent in  February.  
The European C entral Bank (ECB) has kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 
1 percent since May 2009.  The ECB has continued to implement plans to buy €60 billion 
worth of covered bonds; by mid-April, it had purchased €46.4 billion in such bonds.  On 
March 25, the ECB announced that it would continue to accept bonds as collateral with 
ratings as low as BBB - beyond the end of 2010.  Details released following the April 8 
policy meeting indicate that the ECB will implement a graduated schedule of haircuts to 
the value of assets rated in the BBB+ to BBB -range , and that this schedule will replace 
the uniform haircut of 5 percent currently applied to those assets. 
The Greek debt crisis intensified during the intermeeting period.  In light of worsening 
market sentiment regarding the Greek turmoil, euro-a rea m ember states announced on 
April 11 a plan to provide financing to Greece via bilateral loans as part of a package co-financed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) .  The program would cover a 
three- year period , with  member states contributing up to €30 billion in the first year, in 
addition to potential IMF financing of €10-15 billion.  The plan is expected to allow 
Greece to borrow at lower rates than in private capital markets; if fully implemented, this 
funding would probably be sufficient to meet Greece’s financing needs for this year.  In a 
letter to the European Union, the IMF, and the ECB, Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou on April 15 asked to begin discussions on “a multi- year program of 
economic policies. ”  The letter stopped short of asking to activate the aid package 
discussed above, but Papaconstantinou wrote that the program of economic policies 
“could be supported with financial assistance from the euro- area member states and the 
IMF, if the Greek authorities were to decide to request such assistance. ” Currently, teams 
from the IMF, the European Union, and the ECB are set to begin talks in Athens on April  21.

In the United Kingdom , fourth -quarter real GDP growth was revised up to an annual rate 
of 1.8 percent .  Inventories made a larger positive contribution to growth than initially 
estimated, as the moderation in the pace of inventory decumulation was revised up.  Final domestic demand growth was flat, as increases in private and public consumption were offset by large cutbacks in investment. 
First-quarter data on real activity have been mixed.  The unemployment rate edged up to 
8 percent in February , but the number of job seekers receiving unemployment benefits 
posted declines in February and March.  The volume of retail sales grew 2.1 percent in 
February after a sharp drop in January, a pattern likely reflecting a temporary drag f rom 
the 2.5 percentage point hike in the value-added tax at the turn of the year. Industrial production firmed in February but remained near its nadir. 
Forward -looking indicators continue to send conflicting signals about the strength of the 
recovery.  March PMIs were consistent with the output of services and manufacturing 
industries expanding at their historical average. Confidence indicators and most 
components of the Bank of England’s (BOE) Agents’ Summary of Business Conditions 
posted gains in March, although they typically remained below their pre- recession levels .

By contrast, a survey conducted by the British Chamber of Commerce late in the first 
quarter  pointed to furt her stagnation in domestic sales and orders. 
Rising commodity and energy prices continued to exert pressure on producer and tradable prices.  A rise in gasoline prices pushed up headline inflation to 3.4 percent in March.  However, the large amount of economic slack also had moderating effects on wages and services price growth.  The 12 -month change in average earnings excluding bonuses 
remained near a series record low in February. 
In early April, the BOE voted to keep Bank Rate at 50 basis points and ma intain at its 
current level (£200 billion) the stock of asset s purchased through the issuance of central 
bank reserves. On March 24, the government released its budget for the 2010–11 fiscal year (which runs 
from April to March).  The deficit is projected  to edge down from 12.2 percent of GDP in 
2009–10, to 11.2 percent in the current fiscal year, before declining to 4.2 percent by 
2014–2015. Gross debt, currently at about 70 percent of GDP, is expected to peak near 90 percent of GDP in 2013–14.  The budget provided few details about how the government intended to achieve its deficit path.  On April 6, the Queen of England dissolved the U.K. parliament following a request from Prime Minister Gordon Brown to hold a general election on May 6.

In Canada, indicators for the first quarter point to robust near- term growth. In January, 
monthly GDP rose at an annual rate of 7.9 percent, exceeding the 5 percent growth rate in 
the fourth quarter by a sizable margin.  Recent gains have been widespread across industries.  Real exports continued to expand through February, as real import  growth has 
remained  tepid, setting the stage for a large positive net export contribution in the first 
quarter. 
The growth rate of business and household credit, which dipped but remained solidly 
positive throughout the downturn, rose to 4¼ percent in January, well above its low point in August 2009.  Amid this solid credit growth, the Canadian housing market has continued to rebound forcefully.  Building permits rose more than 50 percent over the 
12 months ending in February, remaining in line with the average level of the boom years of 2006 and 2007.  Prices for new houses are increasing. 
The recovery in the business sector continues to lag behind the household sector but is 
starting to pick up steam.  Over the six months ending in January, manufacturing industrial production rose more than 10 percent at an annual rate.  Combined with the positive results from the Bank of Canada’s Business Outlook Survey, the surge may 
indicate a rebound in business investment later this year.  The recent rise in investment reported in the National Income Accounts primarily reflects the rebound in residential

investment.  Nonresidential structures and equipment investment fell 8.8 percent at an 
annual rate in the fourth quarter. 
Labor market conditions continue to improve.  Employment rose 1.2 percent at an annual 
rate over the six months ending in March, just below the 1.6 percent 10-year average 
annual growth rate.  The unemployment rate has continued to decline so far this year, 
reaching 8.2 percent in February, from 8.7 percent in August 2009. 
Consumer prices rose 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in February, down slightly 
from January.  Excluding food and energy , inflation  was 1.5 percent. 
The Bank of Canada maintained its policy rate at 0.25 percent at its April meeting. 
However, the Bank removed its conditional commitment, introduced in April 2009, to keep interest rates at this rate through the end of this quarter.  In response, markets 
increased odds of a near -term policy -rate increase.

  1 The ASEAN -4 countries are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.  
  Economic Situation in Other Countries 
Economic activity in the emerging market economies (EMEs) continued to expand 
robustly in the first quarter and appears to be supported by both domestic demand and 
external demand. Activity picked up in China, and incoming data point to a strong bounceback in growth in the first quarter in India, Singapore, and South Korea, which experienced anemic or negative growth in the fourth quarter. The expansion in the ASEAN-4
1 and Latin America remains strong, although it appears to be moderating to a 
more sustainable pace.  Despite the strength of exports, merchandise tr ade balances 
declined for some countries where strong domestic demand caused imports to outpace exports, most notably in China.  Although inflation has declined a bit in some key countries of emerging Asia, it has moved up in Mexico and Brazil.  Food price increases 
remain a key driver of inflation in many EMEs. 
In China , real GDP increased at a higher -than-expected annual rate of 11.3 percent in the 
first quarter.  The economic recovery remained broad based, with industrial production, 
fixed asset investm ent, and domestic demand remaining robust.  Auto sales in the first 
quarter reached 4.6 million units, up 72 percent from last year.  With imports growing faster than exports, the trade surplus fell in the first quarter to its lowest level since 2005.  Trade in March was essentially balanced on a seasonally adjusted basis, although 
commentators have been highlighting the headline nonseasonally adjusted number, which shows a trade deficit for the first time in six years. 
Headline consumer price inflation came in at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first 
quarter, down from the fourth quarter on waning food price inflation, but 4- quarter 
inflation in March edged higher owing to deflation early last year.  Bank lending slowed in March, but, for the quarter as a whole, outstanding loans rose 26 percent from a year earlier, owing to a large increase in January.  Likely in response to the earlier pickup in lending, and as part of a general tightening in monetary policy, the People’s Bank of China increased its is suance of bonds in the first quarter, draining liquidity from the 
banking sector.

In India , after a contraction of GDP in the fourth quarter, available indicators point to 
strong growth in the first quarter.  The average level of industrial production over January and February was 3 percent above its fourth- quarter average.  The PMI for manufacturing 
hovered around 58 throughout the first quarter, suggesting a vigorous pace of expansion, and was up significantly from the previous quarter.  Despite a sharp rise in exports, strong demand for imports caused the trade deficit to widen in February.  Favorable weather conditions point to a rebound in agricultural output in the first and second quarters, following the drought-related contraction in the fourth quarter of 2009.   
Inflationary pressures have continued to mount.  Twelve-month wholesale price inflation, 
which had been rising in recent months, nearly reached a double-digit pace in February and March, despite some signs of moderating food price inflation. In mid -March, the 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) unexpectedly hiked the repo and reverse repo policy rates by 25 basis points each (to 5 and 3.5 percent, respectively) in an intermeeting decision. It 
followed up with an additional 25 basis points hike at its quarterly monetary policy 
meeting in mid -April. The RBI noted that the strong rebound in economic activity had 
raised the risk that inflationary pressures would spill over from food to other sectors of the economy and unhinge inflation expectations.

In the newly industrialized economies  (NIEs ),2 economic activity appears to have 
accelerated in the first quarter, driven largely by an outsized gain of 32 percent at an 
annual rate in Singapore’s GDP, according to the advance release; if this release is confirmed, this would be the highest quarterly growth rate on record.  The strong performance reflected continued strength in exports and manufacturing, as well as a rebound in the volatile biomedical industry, which had contracted in the fourth quarter.  Recent readings for industrial production and export orders in Taiwan, and robust retail sales and improving labor market conditions in Hong Kong, suggest continued strength in the first quarter.  In Korea, where growth was anemic in the fourth quarter, the average level of industrial production in January and February was above the fourth quarter; confidence indicators, exports, and retail sales in recent months also suggest an upward trend in activity . 
Headline inflation in the NIEs has generally risen this year from low levels, largely 
reflecting food price increases.  Inflation appears to have peaked in Korea and Taiwan in 
January and February, respectively, and is now declining.  To date, central banks in the region have kept policy rates on hold.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore effectively tightened monetary policy at its semi- annual policy meeting by recentering its exchange 
rate target band, shifting it up by about 1 percent, thus allowing for more appreciation of the currency.

In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN-4) , growth appears to have 
remained robust in the first quarter, although it moderated in some cases from the very 
rapid pace of the fourth quar ter.  The average level of industrial production in January 
and February was  3 percent above and 1½ percent above its fourth- quarter level in 
Thailand and Malaysia , respectively .  In Indonesia and the Philippines, industrial 
production in January also improved over the pre vious quarter.  Exports from the region 
continued to increase, causing the trade surplus to expand in Malaysia in the first quarter. However, spurred by strong domestic demand, imports outpaced exports in the Philippines, leading to a narrowing of the trade surplus.  
With the exception of the Philippines, headline 12-month inflation has moderated in the 
region relative to earlier in the year, partly reflecting a decline in food price pressure s at 
the out set of a better -than-expected rice harvest season. With inflation still below the 
target ranges of the central banks in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, policy rates 
have remained unchanged. 
Political tensions have intensified in Thailand .  After four weeks of antigovernment 
protests in Bangkok, the government declared a state of emergency, and violent clashes 
between protesters and troops erupted in early April , leading to a declaration of a state of 
emergency by the government. Protesters cl aim that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva was 
not democratically elected (he was appointed by the parliament in 2008) and are 
demanding new elections.

In Mexico , indicators suggest that economic activity  continued to expand in the first 
quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter, when activity was boosted by 
the reversal of the effects of H1N1 .  Industrial production growth has slowed, after a 
rapid expansion in the fourth quarter.  The PMIs for both the manufacturing and service 
sectors moved higher in Mar ch, and exports continued to gain strength in January and 
February .  Domestic demand has been boosted by falling unemployment, and t he trade 
balance turned to a deficit in the first quarter as imports rose more than exports. 
Headline consumer price inflation on a 12-month basis remained elevated at about 
5 percent in March, still above the Bank of Mexico's (BOM) target range of 2 percent to 
4 percent.  In addition to the effects of hikes in taxes and administered prices, a surg e in 
prices of fruits and vegetables and an increase in air fares and vacation packages related 
to the Easter holiday period appear to have contributed to inflation remaining relatively high.  In early April, the Foreign Exchange Commission—formed by the M inistry of 
Finance and BOM—announced the suspension of its daily dollar auctions, which were 
established in October 2008 to provide dollar liquidity to financial institutions. The 
BOM had sold nearly $8.4 billion through this mechanism.

In Brazil , data releases since the March Greenbook indicate that growth remained robust 
in the first quarter.  In February, industrial production climbed further and retail sales 
continued to be strong.  The March manufacturing PMI remained in expansion territory.  In the first quarter, exports were boosted by higher commodity prices, but the trade 
surplus narrowed further, as import growth surged.  Strong aggregate demand has strained capacity in several areas, fueling inflationary pressures.  Headline inflation has climbed in recent months and came in at 5.2 percent on a 12-month basis in March, up 
from 4.3 percent in December.  Finance Minister Mantega has suggested reducing tariffs to “combat abusive price increases.” 
In March, the central bank voted 5 to 3 to maintain its policy rate at 8.75 percent, with 
three governors preferring an increase of 50 basis points, which the market now expects at the late April meeting.  Central Bank President Henrique Meirelles announced that he will not run for office in the October elections, but he suggested that he may leave his 
central bank position early.
