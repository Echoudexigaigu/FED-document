CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. The a yes have it. The next item on the agenda is the selection  of a Federal Reserve Bank to execu te trans action s for the Sys tem Open I hear ob jections, I will p resum e that the Comm ittee has again  authorized the sam e Bank. 2/2-3/99 3 Next is the selection of the Manager of the System Open Market Account. Our incum bent is Peter Fishe r. I assum e that his nomination is a cceptab le to the New York board? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH . It is indeed. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If the re are no objections except m ine, [laughter] I will assum e that the Committee is a gain auth orizing our inc umbent, Peter Fishe r. We have an exam ination report on the Sy stem  Open Market Account. Are there any question s on that rep ort? If not, I  will assum e that it is acceptable with out objec tion. Next we have a review of the System’s  security lending program  and a related proposal to am end the Comm ittee’s Author izatio n for Dom estic Open Market Operations. Peter, would you like to re view briefly what this involves? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, let m e mention a f ew points, if  I may. The Comm ittee reviews th e Authoriza tion for Dom estic Open  Market Operations at th e first m eeting each year. I have propos ed an am endm ent to the Authorizatio n for the Committee to consider. You have a rather lengthy m emo from m e on the subject. There are a few points I would like to try to cover again. I think I could have done a better job in the memo in providing a clearer contrast betw een the existing program  and the proposed program . Let m e try to do that very briefly. Under the current program  we lend secu rities for one week. We do it in accordan ce with the rath er low lim its on bills  and coupon securities as described in th e memo. We charge a flat f ee of 150 basis points, regardless of the security’s current value in the m arket, and there is a p rohibiti on on short selling. That is, w e are not supposed to lend to dealers who have sold the security short, even though that is virtually impossible for us--and in som e cases for the dealer--to de termine with accuracy. A major change we are proposing is that in stead of charging a flat fee, we would hold an auction with a m inimum reserve fee of 100 basis points. In effect, for the dealers who want the security, this provi des an allocation m echanism  that involves something other than a first-com e first-serve d, helter-skelter basis of who calls the Desk first. An au ction is also a m echanism that allows us not to w aste public assets, so to speak. That is, when we charge a flat fee of 150 basis points for som ething that is worth 2/2-3/99 4 more than 150 basis points “on special” in the T reasury financing m arket, we are giving away System property, if you will, by accepti ng less in come than the Sy stem  could receive. The second change that we are proposing is  in the lim it structur e. Instead of the rather low lim its, higher lim its are proposed, as explained in the m emo. The m ost important shift is from  the one-week term of the lending to overn ight lending. I don’t think I underscored quite enough in the m emo what an im porta nt shift that would be. I have previously described to the Co mmittee m y concern that any change in this program should not simply m ove both the dem and and su pply curves out equall y. That would not accom plish very m uch. The longer we thought a bout th is, the m ore we realized that the willingn ess of  dealers an d market par ticipants to short secu rities is r eally b ased on te rm financing. No one shorts a s ecurity and plans to finance it through a series of overnight borrowings. They think in term s of one-w eek or longer tim e periods when they are trying to finance their short sales. That is where the dem and and supply for shortening securities co me from. By lim iting th e Syst em’s lending to an overnight program  whe re transactions occur only at noon, which is rather late in th e day, I think we would do a better job of  providing a lending facility th at add resses clearin g issues and keeps the apart f rom short se lling activ ities. On the 25 percent lim it that I suggested we begin with, we would actually be lending less than we are lending currently, as  a rough-cut calculation. I noted that I would clearly expect to ra ise that limit som ewhat as I saw increased dem and, but I certainly wo uld not do s o without talking to th is Comm ittee. As I also in dicated in th e memo, it is hard to im agine ra ising that lim it at any one auction to  anything higher than 50 percent of our total holdings in an issue. We think of the proposed program  change s as enhancem ents that will better enable us to achieve ou r existing objectives. These change s are designed to provide a little g rease for the clearing m echanis m and to enable th e dealers to avo id som e of the games that go on when a security is so scarce  that borrowing it has essentially the sam e cost as failing to cover. Then people m ay not  try to cover sho rts at all and  that c reates some perversions. 2/2-3/99 5 That is the nature of the proposed program . As we have designed it, it is still intended to be a lim ited program . I would be  happy now to answer any questions about what I have just said or about any asp ect of the mem o that I circulated to the Comm ittee. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Peter, thank you for th e memorandum . It was very detailed and com plete. In a sense, the m emorandum  presents this as an operational issue, but it seem s to m e that this proposal is closely related to broade r issues about how we m anage our portfolio and where along the m aturity cu rve we operate and so forth. There is something of  the sentim ent of  the old “bills only ” controv ersy that the Comm ittee ha d around this table m any years ago. I have a comm ent that is perhaps half observation and half question. The m emo seem s to imply that in order to run moneta ry policy effectively and engage in open m arket operations effectiv ely, we have to operate all along the curve including issues of longer m aturity. I am not su re that is true. It seem s to m e that we could run m onetary policy entirely, if we n eeded to, by operating only at the short end of the curv e. The question I have is: Doesn’t this proposal raise so me potential problem s and issues?  It seem s to m e that by getting involved in this  kind of operation, we could becom e engaged in argum ents as to why we d ecide to m ake a loan of secu rities in a particular case and not m ake one in som e other case. Whene ver we conduct one of these operations, especially if it involve s a thinly traded issue, we are likely to af fect prices. And in such a situation, som ebody is going to lose and som ebody is going to gain. I don’t think it is too m uch of a stretch to thi nk that conceivably som e moral hazard issues might arise if we conduct lending operations on a regular basis. I just wanted to throw that out and ask if you have thought about som e of these broader issues in addition to the more detailed technical issues th at you covered in the m emorandum . 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. It certainly was not my in tent that any aspect of the program would suggest anything about the m aturity st ructure of the portfo lio; and if the m emo suggests that, I want to corre ct that misim pression. In fact, the dem and for borrowing comes as much from  the bill s ector as the c oupon  sector. So, I really thin k this propo sal is independent of the structure of the portfolio. We could talk  about that, and we have in the past, but I think this proposal st ands apart from that debate. 2/2-3/99 6 On your second point, we have tried to esta blish a set of rules that will avoid our using any discretion. I am not sure I would characterize the issue as involving a m oral hazard p roblem . I want a set of rules  that wi ll enable th is pro cedure to op erate every day without our having to m ake any discrete d ecisions affecting prices or changing our behavior. If we were to ch ange any of the program ’s major features, the big change would be to move from  overnight lending to, say, one-week lendi ng. I would im agine that in a situ ation like th e Drexel c risis, we  would have to com e back to the Comm ittee to propose such a change. I would add that we probably have had a rather bizarre, if whatever dealer happens to call the Desk first in the m orning. So, while the lending program  clearly has some im pact on the price- setting process, I th ink the open auction feature of  the new progr am will resu lt in a m ore transpar ent a nd less eg regious im pact on prices. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. I think the propo sals in the m emorandum  are an improve ment over present procedures. There’ s no question about that. I am really asking the basic question of whether we need to engage in th is activity at all. According to market analysts, the m arket is rath er liqui d and deep. Do we really need to do this? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. The short end of the m arket currently is no t very deep, though I know we all com e with habits of m ind about “r elative to what.” In fact, the bill m arket is as tight as a drum , and the Treasury suppor ts the proposed change. As I have noted a couple of tim es, we have a bit of “after  you, Alphonse” on whose proposal this is. They do not want to be telling us to  do it or not to do it. Their interest in th is actually is focused on the short end  because the  bill s ector is so tigh t that if we decid e to lend a little m ore in that a rea, they think that would be helpful. That conclusion is based only on m y conversations with Treasur y officials. As I pointed out in the m emo, if we had wanted to get out of this business in the late 1980s and early 1 990s on the grounds that the m arket was very deep and liquid and we re ally didn’t need to lend se curities, that could have been a com pelling argum ent. But we  have seen a declin e of 25 percent in the number of prim ary dealers in th e last two y ears. Issue size is contracting. As I will discuss later in the day, the spread between the on-the-run and the twice off-the-run 30-year bond is still at 20 basis points. This m oment in history, when the m arkets are going 2/2-3/99 7 through this supply-shock transi tion, would seem  to be a rather awkward tim e to say these m arkets are deep and liquid an d can take  care of them selves. That would be my counter to the argum ent you are m aking. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think one could also argue that an entity that holds a huge portfolio of Treasury securities and is not allowing them  to be  lent on the m arket in itself creates potential distortions. We are a very large part of the m arket. Certainly, the Federal Reserve has been concerned about pri ce distortions in the Treasury securities potential for shortages in that m arket to di stort and reduce liq uidity  over tim e. This proposal is in m y view an attem pt through th e auction technique to keep the Fed out of the price-setting pro cess except when  the s hortages are quite acute and fairly large overall. I view it as a public policy obj ective to k eep those shortages low and to prom ote liquidity in the m arket in which we operate. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I don’t have any objection to the proposed program , but I m ight understand it better if the fo llowing were explained: W hat difference would we see in the m arketplace if we did no lending  at all versus  lending as o utlined under this proposal?  Tell me what I would look for with and without the lending. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. May I add to that ques tion? You m entioned in your m emo, Peter, that at a tim e of market  crisis it had proved helpful in  the past to ra ise th e lend ing limits above those th at were in p lace. It would help m e to understand this issue if you explained that. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. At the extrem e, one is worried about--I hope I can get all of m y signs right--the problem  that arises when the specials p rice ap proaches zero. That occurs when a security is so scarce that to get m e to lend the security to you, you have to give m e the cash collateral for free. At the Desk, we lend bonds against other bonds as colla teral because ca sh collateral would dra in reserves from  the banking system  and we want to avoid that; however, the m arket pr actice is to use cas h colla teral. Once the specials rate goes to zero, everyone in the m arket who has a short position in that security is encouraged to “fail.” There is then a tendency for the problem to escalate because thos e who have an obligatio n to unwind short pos itions and deliv er the 2/2-3/99 8 securities to others have an econom ic incen tive to do nothing and create a series of “fails”--failures to s ettle. The m ultiplier ef fect kic ks in and worsens th e adverse m arket impact. The result is a s eries of fails  that generally m ake life m iserable and divert attention from price discovery to back o ffices and lead to settlem ent shortages and unsecured p osition s. And this s ituation creates other perv erse incentives. I imagine you get the p icture. So, at th e margin we are trying to reduce the fre quency with which that happens. When I first brought up this issue at the May m eeting last year, I think it was President Hoenig who asked m e whether we co uld do all this discreetly. Could we just lend secu rities when it looked as if we were on the cusp of a problem ? But as we thought long and hard about it, that seem ed to pose the m oral hazard issue that we are now discussing. What is the right specials pr ice? That is, we would be deciding when to interject ourselves, and we would end up inte rvening in th e Treasu ry market in a manner si milar to our intervening in the forei gn exchange m arkets, trying to pick a level and decide when to intervene. We don’t want  to go that route. That would create big problem s for us. So, if we want to have so me impact on the m argin, we think the better way is to use this lending device and do what we  can with our large supply of securities. Now, in the spirit of  this,  let m e be clear. This relates to what Don said. With the hats that the Comm ittee and the T reasury have given m e, I am  engaged in m arket surveillance to preven t the next Salomon Brothers ep isode from happening. I go around giving talks to dealers, telling them  that if they have a long po sition, they ought to be lending it back into the m arket. Well, we have a long position and a lot of securities. If we are concerned about the sm ooth functio ning of the m arkets and if we think good behavior of portfolio m anagers involves being on both sides of the m arket to help keep it deep and liquid, then I think we have a duty in  that regard, too. We really live in the financing market. That is wh ere our operations are. And I think we owe som ething to the m arket to help keep it as liquid as possibl e. So, that is the positive reason. I have also desc ribed what we will be tryin g to avoid, which is th e risk of  fails and specials rates approaching zero. That happens from  time to tim e, and I don’t want to say that we are going to prevent that from  happening. But at the m argin should we be leaning against that with our large por tfolio?  I’d say “yes.” 2/2-3/99 9 Let m e go back to the bills we now hold in  our portfolio. Having sat still and not bought a bill in a bill pass for a couple of y ears, we have gone from  owning 23 percent of bills outstanding to 30  percen t. That illus trates how m uch Treasury issu ance has contracted. So, in the bill sector in particul ar, we m ay really have som ething to offer in terms of trying to keep the m arket liquid. And that m arket does indeed have a very close connection to the m oney m arket in w hich we operate. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Peter, I certainly am  not trying to give you a hard tim e. I understand the kind of pressure you are under, dealing with these people day in and day out, and I know you feel you have certain obligat ions. The difference is that we are the centr al bank , and ther e are sens itivities tha t I hop e we will be very aware of . The m emo tries to deal with som e of these problem s; it really does. But it m akes m e nervous that we have this kind of relationship w ith this m arket. I think it is risky over the longer run. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. But, Al, you do think this pr oposal is preferable to what we do now? 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Yes, absolutely. I was raising a broader question. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further que stions for Peter?  Would som ebody like to m ove the Treasury securities  lending authority he is requesting? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. I move the authority that is requested, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objec tion, so ordered. The next item  on the agenda is the review of the Foreign Currency Authorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with  respect to Foreign Currency Operations. Are there questions for P eter on the m emorandum , which I assum e all of you have read? If not, would som ebody like to m ove approval of the changes he has proposed in the memorandum ? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH . Move approval. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objectio n. Finally, before we get to the main substance of the meeting, you have received a m emorandum  from  Don Kohn on proposed changes to the Program  for Securi ty of FOMC Infor mation. Are there any questions for Don? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I would like to  clarify a few points, Mr. Chairm an, if I m ay. 2/2-3/99 10 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Why don’t you go ahead. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I was trying to respond to a series of issues th at have arisen over the last couple of years in th e course of the investigations of leaks of confidential FO MC inform ation and in conversations with Comm ittee m embers and staff. In this propo sal we are tryin g to accom plish a couple of obj ectives. One is to m ake clear that confidential inform ation extends  beyond the physical or even  electronic docum ents that people possess into what one learns at FOMC  meeting s--the inf ormational content of meetings. Our intent is to define  better what is co nfidentia l. Secondly, we want to facilitate policy discussions am ong staff at the Reserve Banks and here at the Board and between Committee m embers and the staff. So we recomm end reclassifying the Bluebook to Cla ss II to give it a wider circulation and clarifying th at Comm ittee m embers and Bo ard and Bank senior staff can have conversations about research issues that ar ise at m eetings with staff who do not have Class I clearances. Conversations like that  can occur. Those c onversations would not be about what happened at a m eeting, or who said what, and would not be about the results or the vote but about re search issues that need to be pursued betw een m eetings. Thirdly, we want to protect the confiden tiality of the decisionm aking process and the policy decision itself  by continuing to cla ssify the directive, the trans cript, and th e draft m inutes as Class I docum ents. We would continue to lim it the number of people at each Reserv e Bank who can see those docum ents to about 4 o r 5--basically the people who are authorized to attend m eetings. There is som e confusion about this in the docum ent itself, and we will try to clear that up. The new program  also avoids a confusion that apparently existed about the di stinction be tween what is curren tly Class I and who is authorized to see the directive. So, we are shrinking the num ber of Class I docum ents by taking the Bluebook out of that  category. We are making Class I m ore clearly aim ed at what go es on at FOMC m eetings, the m ost conf identia l information that people have. Finally, after readi ng through this and getting co mments from several people around the room , I recognize that som e points st ill need to be clarif ied. We weren’t as clear as we could have b een in every  case.  I would appreciate having comments either at this m eeting or after the m eeting fro m Comm ittee m embers and the staff around the 2/2-3/99 11 room . I would suggest that th e best way to proceed would be  for us to incorporate your comments, clean up the draft, and get back to the Comm ittee in March with a cleaner draft that says what we want it to say. If you don’t vote on this  today, the current program  will continue in  effect for another se ven weeks until the next m eeting. So, it’s not as if we wouldn’t have som ething in e ffect. That would be m y recommendation, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It seem s reasonable. Does anybody have any objection to that? Let’s do that then. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. If som e people have co mments, I’d be happy to hear them . 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. I have just one quick comm ent. I worry a little about the degree of restrictiveness being proposed for what is now going to be Class I, which involves any discussion of wh at actually happens at a m eeting. If we limit Class I inform ation to four people, as I understa nd the proposal, at my Bank that would m ean me along wi th Marvin Goodfriend and only two other people. The way we operate now, I involve five or six people in discussions that get into this kind of detail, and this change would be lim iting for m e. There is  also th e matter of involving new people, giving them  incentives to ge t interested in policy and becom e more knowledgeable about what goes on at th ese m eetings, because at some point they will have to tak e over. I would hope that in rev iewing this p roposal, you will th ink about that asp ect. That is the one point that I really choke on. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Is there a way to have a general set of rules and then, under certain cond itions, to have tem porar y alterations  or rules that endeavor to address a specific situation?  That strike s me as the type of issue you are raising, President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. There is already in these rules, Mr.  Chairm an, the author ity to make exceptions for specific situations. I think P resident Broaddus is raising a broader issue about how m any people norm ally have access to these docum ents. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. What I am  trying to say is that I can conceive of the num ber of people given acces s as being flexible, depend ing on the particular situation and circum stances. We might be wise to be sensitive to that because the purpose is not to withhold inform ation from those who should have it within the System 2/2-3/99 12 but to classify it. The obvious way in whic h we could restrict inform ation is to m ake certain th at nobody knows about it by passing o ut amnesia pills at the en d of each meeting! There has to be som e balance here. It is a tough balance to determ ine. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I talked with Don about this a couple of tim es. Based on your comments, Don, I assum e you plan to do away  with the current arrangem ent in which the sam e group of people who brief a Reserve Bank President also know the outcom e of a meeting. You are pro posing wider access to  the Bluebook  which in th e future will no longer include the directive; a sm aller group w ould be allowed to read the directive; and an even sm aller group could discuss what  went on at the m ost recent m eeting. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think that second distincti on would go away. Its inclusion was an error and is one of the things I would clean up. The directive would be Class I, so the distinction between Class I and direc tive access would go away. The second investigatio n by the Ins pector General po inted to the lim ited access to th e directiv e as one of the rules that a lot of people were confused about. I think that if we can correctly set the num ber of people who should be gi ven access to inform ation about policy discussions at m eetings, th at distinction would not be necessary and should be eliminated. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Let m e then put in a reques t that we take one step back and ask ourselves how m uch sense this m akes. How many people in most Banks get access to all the polic y alte rnative s and are p art of the very intim ate group of people who are advising the President on what he or she should do at the m eeting?  Can we ask ourselves whether it m akes sense not to let a ll those who advise th e President know what went on at a m eeting?  I know the rule lim iting access to the d irectiv e exis ted before and a lot of us didn’t know about it. I am questioning that rule. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Obviously, it is up to the Co mmittee whether it wants to give m ore people access to inform ation about w hat goes on at meetings. Maybe that’s a choice we could give the Comm ittee at the next m eeting: How m any pe ople do you want to have access to Class I inform ation ? You know the risks on both sides. We were try ing to make a distinction between knowing what went  on at a m eeting in the sense of what issues arose and what staff work needed to be done versus knowing what went on in terms of inform ation that could cause a pr oblem  if leaked to the newspapers. 2/2-3/99 13 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I kno w. Obviously, there ha ve to be restrictions. But to treat as outsiders, in term s of what went on at a meeting, people one considers part of one’s close circle or people w ho are involved in di scussions of the issues one brings to the table really does not si t very well with m e. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Communicate to Don whatever issues you would like to raise.  We will try  to clos e this  at the n ext meeting, but it m ay spill over to the meeting af ter tha t. The ultim ate req uirem ent is to get gene ral agre ement on all of  this. We will now go to the s ubstance of  the m eeting and our regular m eeting f ormat. Would som ebody like to move approval of th e minutes of the Decem ber 22 m eeting ? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH . Move approval. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. Peter Fisher, you have the floor. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I will be referring  to the package of colored charts that begins with the chart on 3-m onth deposit rates. You should have that package som ewhere in front of you on the table. 1/ The charts d epict forward rate agreem ents as they have traded over the past seven m onths since July 1st.  As you can see in the top panel for the United S tates, the 9-month forward 3-month rate has been rising rather consistently since November. That tr end continued in January, with some fits and starts, and that rate is now  above the current 3-m onth rate, while the 3-m onth forward rate is  trading just below curren t rates. The point of interest here, I think, is that the po sitive spread in the 9-m onth forward over the 3-month forward is now the widest since June 1997. For the first time in the period shown in this pa nel, expectations are upward sloping, with the 9-month forward trading ab ove rather than below the 3-m onth forward. Looking at the m iddle panel--for Germ any or the euro zone--I think the continued fall in both the curren t and forward rates reflects the expectation that the European Cent ral Bank will respond to signs of weakness in the continental econom ies with further easing, even if that occurs a little later this  year. The weekend conve rsion to the euro went quite sm oothly, as did o ur convers ion of 32.4 billion of System and Treasury holdings of deutschem arks into 16.4 billion of euros. There were some problem s related to volum e in the European paym ents system  and the ta rget sy stem  that lin ks the na tional paym ent system s. This caused 1/ A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Fisher is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 1) 2/2-3/99 14 some frustration with lags in m oving funds around the euro zone, but those seem  to be working them selves out  now after a m onth of transition. Looking at the bottom  panel for Japan, the 9-m onth forward Japanese 3-month rate backed up a fair am ount in late Decem ber and into January and has been trading as much as 20 basis points over current 3-m onth rates. There is m uch going on in Japanese m oney m arkets that I don’t pretend to understand, but the sim ple point I have com e to understand is that since O ctober Japanese govern ment T-bill rates have backed up approxim ately 30 basis points. Having come off their zero an d below zero levels, they have backed up 30 basis points in a period when the Ministry of Finance has increased bill issuan ce by about 20  percen t. This increas e in bill rates seem s to have fl owed through to the money m arket. On January 11, with dollar/yen having broken through 109, the Japanese authorities intervened by purchasing This seem ed to provide som e stability to the exchange rate at around 111 or 112. Last week the yen traded up toward 115 on the increasing perception of the U.S. economy’s robust perform ance. It is back down to around 111 to 112 this week. There is s till a f air bit of noise in the dolla r/yen m arket but, again, I wouldn’t pretend to understand why. Instead of focusing the rest of m y remarks on the Japanese econom y or the U.S. equity m arkets or Brazil, which have received a fair am ount of atten tion in our own written reports  and elsewhere, I though t I would focus on two areas that have been ge tting less attention. Nevertheless, these areas have generated a great deal of uncertainty as well. The first is how to price the dollar/euro and the second is how to price fixed incom e On the seco nd page you will see a 1 0-year h istory of a synthetic euro, based on a m ethodology developed by Hong Kong Shanghai Bank. There are a num ber of m ethodologies out ther e, but over the 10-year history there is not much difference am ong them . This chart is for broad-brush purposes. A basic fact to keep in m ind is that the euro is quoted in dollars per euro. The dollar was weakest--at the top of the chart--in 1992 when it traded at almost $1.50 per euro; it was strongest--at the bottom  of the chart --in 1989 and 1997 when it traded through $1.05. To give som e perspective, we have indicated w eeks in which the  U.S. authorities intervened in dollar/m ark, but we did not include dollar/ye n interventions. They are not m arked here, but clearly there we re occasions w hen we intervened in dollar/yen, and that in tervention had a rather strong im pact on dolla r/mark as well. This just li sts the dollar /mark interve ntions to provide reference points. 2/2-3/99 15 My point in bringing th is to your attention is, first, that there seem s to be relatively little aw areness in  the m arkets about how strong the dollar has been recently; it traded around 10 -year highs during m ost of 1997 and 1998. Secondly, it is not at all clear what people m ean when they say that they expect the euro to be a strong currency. Do they m ean that they expect it to trade above it s launch rate of about 1.18?  Do they m ean that they expect it to trade up into the 1.30 s during a norm al cycle?  Or do they mean that they expect its  average ra te over the next 10 years to be higher than its average rate over the past 10 y ears? The fact of the matte r is that people speak rather loosely about this. That reflects, in m y view, a great lack of conviction on how to price this currency. Even though people think they know about dolla r/mark, dollar/euro is really a different anim al. To give you som e flavor of that lack of conviction and the jitteriness in the target system closed one hour late. Mr. Chairm an, at the last m eeting you asked m e if I could explain the differential between U.S. and U.K. swap spreads and those on the continent, and I feebly mum bled so mething about central bank trading. On som e reflection, I would not want to hang m y hat on that answer. I know that staff at the Board and New York have tried to com e up with some explanation, but we are still uncomfortable with our lack of understanding of that phe nomenon. One reason I am  uncomfortable is that the longer I look at the relationships, the m ore I realize how much I don’t understand about the underlying re lationships am ong governm ent bond yields, which are shown at the top of page 3. The top panel shows the yields since last July 1 on U.S., U.K., Italian, French, and Germ an 10- year governm ent bonds as well as the yield on the U.S. Treasury inflation-indexed 10- year bond, which is depicted by the dotted red line. You can see that th ere was quite a rally in European governm ent bond m arkets in Novem ber and December. That brought us to the m oment on January 5, which was the day before an auction of new U.S. inflation-indexed 10-year secu rities, when the yield on both the outstanding Treasury indexed security and the outstanding Italian governm ent nom inal 10-year bond stood at an identical 3.94 percent. While the U .S. inflation-indexed yiel ds have fallen about 15 basis points since then and the Italian nom inal yields have traded sideways, both Germ an and French governm ent 10-year bonds have traded through the U.S. inflation-protec ted 10-year rate. We know that the pricing of our inflation-indexed security is problem atic, but the problem s are likely measured in tens of basis points. I don’t pretend that I have a m agic ru le here, but we know we  are dealing with a prem ium for illiqu idity and in pa rticula r for the tax trea tment that the dea lers complain abo ut quite a b it. But there must be something 2/2-3/99 16 happening on the European side of this  equa tion a s well. The optim ists in Europe would like to explain th e low governm ent bond yields as a reflection of the rush of capital in to the euro and the confidence that global investors have in the EC B. Others, perhaps m ore plausibly at least so far, suggest that the declinin g yields reflect the dete riorating outlook for the continental econom ies. But if the eu ro’s own econom ies are as weak as these yields suggest, where are the tax r eceipts going to com e from  to help these governm ents avoid issuing a lot more bonds? To m ake the general point, let m e offer what is clearly m y own opinion: That fixed incom e markets have  been s low to recog nize th at the so-called sh ort-run supp ly/dem and dynam ics have recen tly been having a much bigger im pact on yield curve movem ents than have changes in inflation exp ectations, at least over the most recent period. Consider the U.S. Treasury m arket over the last 2 years with d ecreases in n ew issuance and the flight-to-quality buying. Consider the Japanese governm ent bond There is also considerable unease in the U.S. governm ent bond relatively little im pact on spreads th at were g reatly affected by the even ts of last August, Septem ber, and October. The traders in U.S. Treasuries are still not at all com fortable. Liquidity rem ains at a very high prem ium. The bottom  red line shows that the twi ce off-the-run spread is still around 20 basis points, as contrasted with th e 2 to 5 basis point spread that had prevailed f or most of  the last 5 y ears until the eve nts of  the pa st few months. Again, let m e make clear that I am  offering m y own opinion. While the events of last fall effectively knocked fixed incom e markets off their then-ex isting equilibriu m, m arkets have not yet found a new equilib rium that they are comfortable with. I don ’t mean to suggest that m arkets are fragile, bu t I do m ean that they are s till groping a nd do not ha ve a grea t deal of conviction about their pricing of fixed incom e instrum ents. It would be fair for any m ember of the Comm ittee to point out that I m ay be having problem s getting supply and dem and right in m y own backyard of the fed funds m arket! Turning to the next page, let us go over our operations in the dom estic periods depicted in the top two panels, we set out to be quite generous--to lean against the tightness that we ha d been seeing during the late fall and in early Decem ber and against the norm al year-end funding pressures. We then found that our generosity in supplying reserves was heavily supplem ented by unanticipated weathe r-induced float from  the winter storm s acros s the Midwe st and th e Northeas t. In the f irst maintenance 2/2-3/99 17 period, our generosity was aim ed at avoiding a firm  end-of- period settlem ent date, which w e feared m ight set us up f or a tight year-end that coincided with the first day of the se ttlem ent period. We debated at som e length am ong ourselves how best to pr epare the m arket for the Decem ber 1999 year-end Y2K event. We deba ted whether we should be intentionally generous to calm  anxieties or intentiona lly stingy to engine er a tight close this year in order to encourage everyone to think they had better lock in their funding in advanc e for the next year-end. We chose the generous route and w ere reward ed at least in one sense with a noticeable decline in the 1999 year-end prem ium, as evidenced by futures prices over the last coupl e days of the year. In the second period, bad weather contributed to especially high, unpredictable float and we drained reserves aggressively on several occasions. In the th ird m aintenance period, I h ave only m yself to blam e for the softness. I thought we had ro om to do a term  operation of m odest size and thereby avoid th e need to op erate each d ay with overnight RPs of different sizes and still leave room  for any additional float or change in other factors. I was either wrong or  unlucky or both, and we ended up with a little more float and a soft rate through the m iddle of the period. Overall, I am glad that we now ha ve the long-term  RP in our tool kit, and I thank the Comm ittee for adding it. We are going to continue to reflect on our experience of this past year-end as we begin to plan for the coming year-end. Mr. Chairm an, I will need a vote to ratify our dom estic operations, and I would be happy to answer any questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Are there questions? 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Peter, I probably shoul d know this from  som ething else you have sent us, but when you converted our holdings of securities denom inated in deutschem arks to securities denom inated in euros, what did you do? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. We did a series of forei gn exchange trades with ourselves, which is really what everyone did to convert. These are not done with any counterparty. We just take out all the assets denom inated in m arks and then put them  back in denom inated in euros, asset by asset. Then the challenge is to confirm  that with  all our counterparties and custod ians down the supply chain , if you will, to m ake sure we get to the sam e numbers. But essentially the conversion i nvolved a rather rudim entary process of doing 2/2-3/99 18 a foreign ex change trade with oneself; that was the case for u s and for all the m arket participan ts. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You leave us hanging. Did you check to see if it worked? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes. I meant to cover th at. I did say that our conversion went quite well; m aybe I covered that too quickl y. We were am ong those who experienced some of the glitches in the new European paym ent system . We were holding our breath sometimes to m ake sure we did not fail on our delivery of euros while waiting for the queue to work through, but we avoided any prob lems with that. The real issue cam e in the first week when the Germ an paym ent system did not seem to be up to the volum e, which is curious becaus e the volum e was m uch reduced. The Germ ans had put throug h some changes in th eir own dom estic paym ent system  simultaneously with the shif ted target. That taxed the capacity of the Ge rman paym ent system and there were som e bottlenecks. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. The portfolio now has euro-d enom inated d eposits at th e Bundesbank, euro-denom inated Germ an governm ent securities, and euro-denom inated deposits at the BIS? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, and euro-denom inated repo agreem ents with our counterparties, with Deutsche Bank as our custodian. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Okay. Under what circ umstances would we wind up having in the por tfolio euro-denom inated ob ligations  of other taxing authorities besides the Germ ans? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. We will not, until th is Comm ittee discusses whether I sho uld buy some other assets. That is, we are limiting our repos to Germ an governm ent instrum ents. I think I mentioned so me months ago that we will se e how the m arkets develop, and  we m ay com e back to the Comm ittee to discuss  divers ifying . In particu lar, the French short end is much m ore liquid, so  the issue is whether we would want to migrate ther e if we want our holding s to be m ore liquid. The Desk will n ot make that other. I already have a list of people from  non-Germ an EU governm ent finance ministries w ho want to com e visit with m e. I am very m uch looking forward to being 2/2-3/99 19 able to say: “I’m  happy to consider your pr oposal but I have to talk to the FOMC before we m ake any decisions.” 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Incidentally, I noticed th at the issuance of euro bonds in the international m arket in January exceeded the issuance of dollar-denom inated bonds and exceeded th e com bination of those denom inated in the p revious curren cies that went in to the euro. Is this a short-term , one-tim e adjust ment? Or are we looking at the longer-run im pact of presum ably narrowing bid-ask spreads on the euro vis-à-vis the predecessor curren cies? In short, does th e introduction of the euro represent a m ajor developm ent in the international bond m arkets or one that is going to fade once th e one-tim e impact diss ipates? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. That is a well phrased question. My view is that a lot of issuers want to test the m arket quickly. That is, we  are talking about the i ssuance of new bonds. Everyone wants to g et in because in  their se ctor of the euro m arket they can be the benchm ark, just as all European governm ents are debating who is going to be the benchm ark. If Philips or  whatever co rporate entity can get in and crea te a nam e for itself, will it have a leg u p on others ? Some corporations m ay find it wor ks very well f or them , and they m ay expa nd their program . I have a sense that it’s a matter of “Let’s try it and see how it goes.” If I followed your question, I’m  not quite sure I see a sm ooth trans ition f rom that to h ow the euro/dolla r exchange rate will trade and what its bid-ask spread will be. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. No, I wasn’t referring to the exchange rate. I was referring to the notion th at as the agg regate issu ance of euro securities in creas es, one would expect the bid-ask spread in the si ngle euro currency to be narrower than the average bid-ask spread in its predecessor curr encies. Even though differences still exist with respect to taxes and even  though there are all sorts of other concerns, the liquidity differences presum ably will na rrow the ave rage euro bid- ask spread, and that shou ld increase both the dem and for and the supply of new issues in the euro m arket. The question I am putting to you rela tes to m y recollection that the predecessor currencies accounted f or 30 to 35 percent of the issuance m arket but in January issuance in the euro 2/2-3/99 20 broadening of the m arket or the m ere novelty of it. Perhaps people who had been thinking of doing an offering in deutschem arks decided to wait another few weeks to do it in euros. That’s the nature of m y question. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Right. I think the January effect we are observing is a curiosity effect. Your other hypothesis m ay well pr ove right over tim e, but I don’t expect a smooth m ovem ent from  where we are now, given what happened in January. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Is the increase in the offerings, which effectively means going short in euros, a factor in the eu ro’s declin e from its in itial of fering price ? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. That is som ething som e of us ha ve speculated on. I don’t think we have firm evidence that there will be a lot of borrowing by people who don’t live in the euro zon e, since they  have to take their proceeds out. So, the first-run effect of such borrowing would be to weaken the euro. Some of us have been telling E CB and NCB officials for som e years that having a deep and liquid capital m arket is not a one-way-up ticke t for the  exchange r ate, and I thin k there may be som e of that. I still ascribe the thinness of the m arket and m ost of the tenta tiveness in exch ange ra te tra ding to th at. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further questions? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH . Mr. Chairm an, I m ove approval of the domestic operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Approved without objection. Let’s move on to the Chart Show and Messrs. Pr ell, Alexander, and Stockton. Gentlem en. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I will start the p resentation. We will be referring to the package of charts entitled “S taff Presentation on the Ec onom ic Outlook,” which m ay be at the bottom of the pile of papers in front of you. 2/ Chart 1 provides a basic summ ary of the staff econom ic forecast. As you know, the BEA published its advance estimate of four th-quarter GDP on Friday; it was a half point above our 5 percent guess. However, given that the BEA num bers do not really point  us in a different direction--and they are only tentative, in any ev ent--we have stuck with the Greenbook figures for our presentation today. The top panels of the chart s how our projection for real G DP, on a four-quarter percent chan ge basis. We are looking for a substantial 2/ A copy of the m aterial used by the staff is  appended to the tran script. (Appendix 2) 2/2-3/99 21 report--to around 2½ percent this year a nd next. As the bars in the left panel indicate, the slowing is entire ly accounted for by dom estic spending: The negative contribution from  net e xports is expected to diminish considerably  over the forecast p eriod. Though the growth of output is m uch slower, it is pretty close to our estim ate of  the trend rate  for potentia l, so tha t the unem ployment ra te--the red line in the m iddle panel--changes lit tle from  where it was last quarter. The chart also shows the m ovements in the factory utiliza tion rate. Over the past year, we observed the odd patte rn of the plant utilization rate dropping som ewhat below its long-term average even as the jobless rate was reach ing a 28-year low. We are anticipating that these in dicato rs of supply pressures will conti nue to send conflicting messages, each of them changing little on net over the next two years. As Dave will be d iscussing la ter, we have giv en grea ter w eight to the labor m arket tautness in arriv ing at the inflation forecast sho wn in the bottom  panel. We foresee a noticeable  pickup in the pace of price increase over the next two years--about a percentage point as m easured either by the CPI or by the GDP chain index. Chart 2 presents some of the financial backdrop for this projection. The basic as sumption is that the fe deral funds rate will be un changed through nex t year. As yo u can see in the top pan el, given ou r forecast of rising inflation, this im plies a furthe r decline in the real funds rate-­proxied by the nom inal rate m inus the r ecent inflation rate. In fact, it is not at all clear that inflation expectati ons have com e down as far as actual inflation in the past year, so this measure m ay overstate the current level of the real rate--and consequently may exaggera te the dec line that lies ahead. But I would characterize ou r forecast as incorporating  a real short-term interest rate that is at th e low end of the range since 1995. The real short ra te is scarcely an unam biguous or com prehensive gauge of the financial im petus to dem and, s o it is worthwhile to look at a few other indicators of credit m arket cond itions. The picture is m ixed. In the middle left panel, you can see that nom inal yields on Treasury and investm ent grade corporate bonds have  fallen over the past couple of years--probably by m ore than longer- term inflation expectations. Junk bond yields also eased a bit until th e market was jolted by the Russian default shock last summer. The junk  rate index plotte d here is now up roughly 1½ percentage points from  a year ago, suggesting that the typical low grade firm  is facing a considerably increased long-term  borrowing cost. The senior loan officer survey --the basis of the right panel--indicates that bus inesses also are facing a little  less friendly recep tion at comm ercial 2/2-3/99 22 banks, with loan underw riting standards having been tightened som e in recen t months, especially in the case of larger firm s. Credit has not dried up, however, as m ay be seen in the bottom  panel, which plots the real debt growth of  households and businesses com bined. Through the fourth quarter, the end of the solid portion of the line, debt growth rem ained rap id. We are forecasting a m oderation, but this is scarcely a credit-crunch scenario--as might have been feared for a while last fall. Lenders have turned a bit more cautious, but m ost of the explanation for the projected slackeni ng in debt expansion com es from  the demand side. If there are corresponding signs of  increased caution in eq uity m arkets , they are rather difficult to find. Share prices have continued to soar, and where they are headed from  here clearly is a cru cial ques tion for the econom ic outlook. The top panels of Chart 3 don’t answer that question, but they provide som e provocative perspective by com paring the perform ance of the U.S. stock m arket in the 1990s with a couple of other impressive b ull m arkets of yesteryea r--Japan in the 1980s an d Wall Street in the 1920s. Given the am ount of ar tistry involved in choosing the base periods and thus aligning these cu rves, I would recomm end t aking the pictures with at least a grain of salt . But, if you have a taste f or salt, perhaps they are suggestive of som e of the risks confronting us. The m iddle panels com e at the is sue from  an angle that is perhaps a b it more analytical. At the left, I have repeated an ex hibit I’ve u sed in prior presentations to dem onstrate why share prices had to peak soon. Perhaps you should stop m e befor e I do it again! [Laughter] The latest observations are rough approxim ations, given yesterday’s prices and our estim ates of earnings through year-e nd. The S&P 500’s aggregate P/E is at an unprecedented level. And, to underscore the abnorm ality, it has achieved this m ultiple n ot when ear nings had a cyclical up turn in f ront of them  but rather, as you can see in th e bottom  left panel, when the profit share of GNP has risen to a m ulti-de cade high. A nd, if the S&P m ultiple is remarkable, that for the NAS DAQ c omposite--at the right--is astonishing, moving rapidly toward triple digits! Although som e analysts would sa y--indeed, have said --that earnings are beside the point in va luing sto cks in this New Era, we have not been able to break the habit of looking at them --which m ay help to explain our forecast erro rs. I have sh own, in th e bottom  right panel, annu al percent changes in NIPA corporate profits-- the black line--along with those for S&P 500 earnings per share. The accoun ting concepts and coverage of the two series differ, but they have tended to move together. In that light, the divergen ce between our forecast of NIPA profits in 1999 an d the S&P predictions of W all Street strategists is worth noting. It suggests that the 2/2-3/99 23 months ahead. If we had an ade quate sam ple of t he W all Street expectations for 2000, I suspect that th e story would be reinforced. Such disappointments have not stopped the market to date, but we have assum ed that--from  such high valuations --it will be difficult to extend the uptrend in prices. If we prove to be anywhere close to right about th e trend from  here, the couple of years. Chart 4 summarizes som e of the key considerations in our forecas t for dom estic dem and. Because these are fam iliar stories, I shall just run through the list very quickly. The upper left panel highlights th e fact that though we have the wealth-incom e ratio declining, the lags in the effects on spending lead us to expect that consum er outlays will con tinue to grow faster than incom e for a while longer, pushing the saving rate still lower. But spending growth does m oderate. In the housing m arket--depicte d at the right--we expect that with mortgage rates rem aining near current  levels, the m onthly paym ent burden of hom e-ownership will rem ain attractively low. This should keep housing dem and from  falling sharply as incom e and wealth growth weaken. In the business sector, the slow ing of output growth, depicted in the middle left panel, will turn the acc elerator effects on capital spending negative. But that should be partly offset by the favorable effect of a continu ing declin e in th e relative p rice of equipment--charted at the right. Inventory investm ent, the red line in the bo ttom left panel, is exp ected to move pretty closely with final sale s. Not m uch of a story there. And, finally, governm ent purchases ar e projected to run a little stronger on balance over the next two years. In the state and local sector, surplu ses are growing to the point where we would expect to see som e greater expenditure on infrastructure. In the federal secto r, real purch ases are expected to com e closer to bottom ing out, with som e obvious upside risks in defense and other outlay categ ories. The pickup in governm ent spending, however, is only a m odest offset to the slackening in the growth of private dem and that we foresee. Lew will now shift the focus from the dom estic side to the extern al sector. 

[SECTION]

MR. ALEXANDER. The m ain changes in our f orecast on the international side have been driven by events in Brazil. Our previous 2/2-3/99 24 assum ption that Brazil’s exchange rate  peg would hold has obviously been proved wrong. Your next chart focuses on recent developm ents in Brazil and highlights the key policy problem s facing the Brazilian au thorities at this tim e. As can be seen in the upper left panel of Chart 5, the Brazilian real depreciated by m ore than 40 per cent in the last three weeks through last Friday. The real has appreciated about 8½ percent following the announcem ent that Arm inio Fraga, a for mer intern in the Division of Intern ational Finance, [laughter] would rep lace Francisco Lop ez as th e head of the Brazilian Central Bank. Early in January, a dispute over in tergovernm ental debts between the state of Minas Gerais and the Br azilian Federal Governm ent, though relatively insignif icant by itse lf, high lighted the lack of consensus on the need for fiscal consolidation within  Brazil’s com plicated federal political system . As the dispu te threatened to  widen to other states, pressures on the real m ounted. On January 13, th e Brazilian authorities attem pted a controlled devaluation of 8 percent. Significant capital outflows continued and the r eal was allowed  to float two days la ter. The antic ipated fallout from the colla pse of  the re al--including continued high price-adjusted inte rest rates, heig htened econ omic uncertainty, a greater burden of fo reign currency denom inated debt, and pressures on  the financial system --is projected to cause a severe downturn in econom ic activity in Braz il this year. As shown at the upper right, we now expect the downturn in Brazilian GDP  to steepen in the f irst ha lf of this year and to extend, although at a diminishing rate, for the rem ainder of the forecast period. Brazilian po licym akers now face a dilemm a. With the ch ange in the exchange rate regim e and the sharp devaluation of the real, it may be necessary to keep interest rates high to contain inflation. But Brazil’s fiscal position rem ains precarious, owing in pa rt to high debt service costs. The red bars in the m iddle left panel indicate that Brazil’s public sector borrowing requirem ent was over 8 percent of GDP last year, even with a m odest surplus on  the non-interest, or prim ary, part of the budget. Fiscal po licy action s enacted s ince last fall are expected to increas e Brazil’s fiscal balance by about 3 percent of GDP this year. But a substantia l overall def icit will r emain unless in terest costs dec line. Over the last year, dom estic sho rt-term interes t rates in Br azil--the black line in the m iddle right pane l--averaged about 28 percent, while inflation--the red line--was only abou t 3 percent. Roughly two-thirds of the governm ent’s dom estic debt carries an interest rate th at is linked to overnigh t interes t rates. At the end of last year, Brazil’s federal debt was already equal to about 50  percent of GDP, up from just 35 percent in 1996. 2/2-3/99 25 Persis tent h igh inte rest r ates cou ld put Brazil’s governm ent debt on an explosiv e path. On the o ther hand, h igh interest rates m ay be necessary to contain inflation expectations. One of the critical uncertainties  facing Brazilian po licym akers at this tim e is the degree to which the recen t devaluation will pass through to inflation. The bottom two panels offer som e perspective on this problem. The bottom  left panel shows the exchange rate, dom estic inte rest rates, and inflation for Mexico over the period from  1994 to 1996. In this case the sharp devaluation of the peso at the end of 1994 was followed by a burst of inflation that peaked at an annual rate of over 100 percent. The lower right panel shows the sam e three va riables for Korea ove r the last two years. The devaluation of the Kore an won at the end of 1997 was roughly the sam e magnitude as the devaluatio n of the Mexican peso, but in the Korean case inflation only reached a peak of about 30 percent. Before 1997 Korea had less historical experien ce than Mexico with either large exchange rate depreciations or high in flation, and this m ay have helped to limit the passthrough of the depreciation to inflation expectations and hence to dom estic inflation itself. Our forecast for Brazilian inflation o ver the n ext year falls so mewhere between the Korean and Mexican ex amples. Empirical analysis of exchange rate passthrough in Brazi l, covering the period before the adoption of the real plan in 1994, w ould have suggested a pattern m ore like the Mex ican exam ple. But over the last four years th e Brazilian governm ent has pursued policies intende d to lim it inflationary dynam ics. For exam ple, explic it ind exation of wages was banned in 1995. Obviously, there is considerable uncer tainty abou t our inflatio n forecast for Brazil. Your next chart focuses on our outlook for other em erging market econom ies. Our curren t forecast does not anticip ate ex treme contagion to other em erging m arkets from  recent events in Brazil. To som e degree, this represents a change in our thinking, in  that in our previous “w orse case” analyses we assum ed that a failu re of Brazil’s program  would likely generate severe financial pressures on other em erging m arket econom ies. This change in our thinking reflects the fact tha t over the las t severa l months financial m arkets have increasingly distinguished Brazil from other em erging m arket econom ies. The top left panel of Chart 6 show s yield sp reads relative to U.S. Treasuries, f or Brazilian, Mexican, and Argentine Brady bonds. In the immediate afterm ath of t he Russian devaluation and default in August, these sp reads generally moved toge ther. But sin ce Decem ber Brazilian Brady spreads have m oved up m ore sh arply than those for Argentina and Mexico. Domestic inter est rates in Mexico and Argentina, shown in the 2/2-3/99 26 top right panel, are up som e since the m iddle of January, but these increases are m odest compared with those seen in August and Septem ber. Perhaps not surprisingly, the financ ial contagion from  Brazil to Asian emerging markets is ev en m ore m odest. Cred it spreads for Korean and Thai sovereign bonds--the black and red lines in the m iddle left panel-­ticked up w hen the real was devalue d, but those increases have been reversed. The events in Brazil raised  som e speculation about the viability of currency pegs in Hong Kong and China, but these pressures were relatively m ild. As shown in the m iddle right panel, the 1-m onth Hong Kong interbank interest rate has in creased about 150 basis points since mid-January. Interest rates im plied by offshore forward contracts for the Chinese renm inbi m oved up som ewhat m ore but this was probably related to the Chinese governm ent’s decision not  to give preferential treatm ent to foreign investors in the bankrupt cy of GITIC, a failed Guandong investm ent com pany. Our outlook for GDP growth for e merging m arket econom ies, other than Braz il, is shown in the lower r ight panel. The repercussions from Brazil’s eco nomic difficulties are ex pected to have negative impacts-­lower exports to Brazil and som e spill over of financial m arket pressures-­on other Latin Am erican countries. Consequently, we expect the rest of Latin Am erica to suffer a recession in 1999, with real GDP in these countries falling about 1½ percent before rebounding 2¾ percent in 2000. In contrast, real GDP in all five of  the so-ca lled “ Crisis Asia” em erging sharp declines in output in 1998--is e xpected to bottom  out and return to positiv e gro wth by the end of 1999. As you can see in the lo wer left panel, indu strial production has alrea dy return ed to positiv e territory on a year-over-year basis in K orea, a nd Thailand is not far behind. We continue to assum e that Hong Kong’s peg to th e dollar will h old, but at th e expense of som ewhat higher interest rates. Accordingly, real GDP in Hong Kong is now expected to decline 2 percent in 1999. Real GDP in China is expected to grow by about 6 percent in 1999, a slower pace than estim ated for 1998. Your next chart presents the sta ff’s outlook for Japan and Canada. We continue to be very pessim istic about the prospects for recovery in Japan. Since m id-Nove mber long-te rm Japanese governm ent bond yields --the red line in the top left pa nel--have m oved up m ore than 1½ percentage points, and the yen--the black line in that panel--has appreciated about 6 percent relative to the dollar. The sharp increase in bond yields followed the m id-December announcem ent of a 1999 budget and associated financing  plans th at envision som ewhat greater fiscal expansion and greater bond issuance  this year than m ost m arket participants had expected. The chan ge in Japan ’s cyclically adjusted fiscal 2/2-3/99 27 deficit, shown in the upper right panel,  is expected to exceed  2 percen t of GDP this year and to be about  ¾ percent of GDP next year. There are few signs of a revers al in the downward trajectory of underlying private dom estic dem and, howev er. In the fourth quarter of last year, housing starts and new car registrations fe ll to th eir lowest levels in over a decade, and the labor m arket rem ains depressed. Since the beginning of  the year Japanese bank st ocks- -the re d line in the m iddle lef t panel--have been buoyed by potential m ergers and the per ception that the Japanese authorities m ay be beginning  to m ove more aggressively to reform  the banking system. Such optim ism may be prem ature. In late Japanese banks, including Ba nk of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. We project that Japanese  real GDP--the black bars in the m iddle right panel--will continue to fall over the f orecas t horizon even with significan t fiscal stim ulus. Japanese consum er prices --the red bars--are expected to fall 2 percent in 1999, but part of this decline is the reve rsal of  special factors th at artificially elevated cons umer prices at the end of last year. Our outlook for other industrial countries is not so gloom y. Declines in comm odity prices over the last two years put downward pressure on the Canadian dollar, shown in real eff ective term s as the black line in the bottom  left panel, particular ly in th e first th ree qu arters of last year. Given that we now project a pickup in both oil and non-oil comm odity prices this year, we expect the Canadian dollar to appreciate som ewhat against the U.S. dollar this year and next. Our outlook for Canada is shown in the lower right panel. Canada should re gister growth near 2½ percent this year and in 2000--the black bars--with only a m odest uptick in inflation, as shown in the red bars. The staff outlook for Europe is presented in Chart 8. Exchange rate strength has been an im portant f actor in a tightening of m onetary conditions in Europe over the past year  and a half. The black line in the upper left panel shows a constructed seri es for the real effective exchange rate for the euro area, using the DM  as an historical proxy. Although the real v alue of  the effectiv e euro ha s fallen since O ctober, this move retraced on ly partially th e steep appr eciation th at occurred following the outbreak of the Asian crisis in m id-1997. The real value of sterling--the red line--ex perien ced an  even greate r appre ciation, which sta rted e arlier, before it, to o, eased so mewhat in recent m onths. The latest data suggest that m omentum behind European grow th has ebbed lately and the outlook for Europe has softened. This has been especially apparent in Germ any, but has started to show through in other key European countries as well. As shown in the m iddle left panel, 2/2-3/99 28 indicators of  business confidence in  both Germ any and France--the black and blue lines, respectively--have fallen steadily since the spring of last year. Despite a sharp uptick in la te 1998, U.K. business conf idence--the red line- -still is well of f its ear ly-1997 level. Euro-a rea labo r market conditions improved som ewhat last y ear, as illustrated by Germ an and French une mploym ent rates in th e middle right panel. But the declines in unem ployment rates have been m odest and, as activity has slowed recen tly, tho se rates have leveled off. The upper right panel shows three-m onth interest rate futures in Europe. In view of increasing s igns of deceleration in Europ e, markets appear to have factored in a m odest  declin e in eu ro-denom inated short-term interes t rates ov er the near term . Futures r ates also sugg est th at following substantial d eclines alr eady  implem ented since Octo ber. The staff forecast is cons isten t with this pattern. The European outlook f or real GDP growth is summarized in the lower left panel. Growth in both the euro area and the United Kingdom should slow by about ½ pe rcentage point this year before recovering somewhat in 2000. U.K. inflation, the top line in the lower right panel, should stay on target at 2½ percen t. Although in flation rates will vary across the euro area, they should stay low on average and w ell within the target range of zero to 2 pe rcent spec ified by the ESCB. My next chart outlines the influe nce of the foreign outlook on the U.S. external accounts. The top left panel depicts trends in the value of U.S. exports to our principal export m arkets. U.S. exports to Europe--the black line--and to Canada, the green line, advanced steadily last year. Exports to L atin Am erica--the bl ue line--rem ained relatively strong throughout 1998 as well. U.S. shipm ents to Asia--the red line--fell sharply last y ear. The jum p in shipm ents in the f ourth q uarte r to Asian m arkets was largely due to aircraft. U.S. exports have been restrained  by weak econom ic activity abroad and a strong dollar. Turning to line 1 in the table in the top right panel, we estim ate that econom ic growth in th e foreign industri al countries was below trend last y ear; we projec t that growth will pick up only  slightly during the next two years. Strength in Canada and W estern E urope will only partially offset the eff ect of the recess ion in Japan. As shown in the m iddle left panel,  the dollar had a ppreciated sharply in real term s during the past two year s, by nearly ten percent against m ajor currencies--the red line--and by m ore than 15 percent against those of our other im portant trading partners--th e black line--before depreciating during th e past few m onths. In our f orecas t, the dollar re mains essentially 2/2-3/99 29 flat in real term s, appreciating ag ainst the currencies of Latin Am erica an d depreciating with respect to m ost of  the currencies of Asia and Europe. This assum ption reflects a balancing of risks, with the prospect of strong U.S. growth tending to support the dolla r and concerns about the widening U.S. externa l deficit tend ing to depress the dollar. The m iddle right panel depicts the arithm etic contribution of U.S. exports and im ports to U.S. GDP growth. Real exports of goods and services, the black bars, fell during th e first half of last year before rebounding last quarter. We project that exports will decline again during the first half  of 1999 and then stage a slow recovery. We project that imports--the red bars--will co ntinue to advance at a slower, but still strong, pace th is year and nex t. The U.S. external accoun ts are p lotted in the lower lef t panel. We estim ate that the nom inal U.S. trade balance--the red line--in current dollars in the fourth qua rter recorded a deficit of  $182 billion, nearly $70 billion larger than in the fourth quarter of 1997. With accumulating U.S. curren t acco unt deficits and the resul ting deterioration in the U.S. net international investm ent position, net investm ent incom e--the blue line--is projected to continue its decline th rough 2000. We project that the deficit in the cu rrent accoun t--the black lin e--will increas e to $374 billion in 2000 which, as shown in the lower right pane l, is equivalent to 4.0 percent of U.S. GDP, noticeably ab ove the peak  reached in the 1986-87 period. In recent m onths financial m arket participants have focused increasingly on the widening U.S. exte rnal deficits and their implications for the exch ange value o f the dollar.  Your next chart considers the relationship between the value of the dollar over the m edium  term and the likely path o f the U.S. net inves tment position --that is, U.S. f oreign as sets less U.S. lia bilitie s owed to f oreigne rs. The top right panel shows the ratio of the U.S. net investm ent position to  GDP, on an inverted scale, over the next 20 years under two assum ptions about the path of the real exchange rate. The black line shows the path  under the assum ption that the dollar depreciates, in real term s, at a rate  of about 1½ percent per year after the end of the Greenbook forecast perio d. The projection is based on an updated version of the long- term model the IF Division used in its Current Account Sustainability project two y ears ago. One of the conclusions of that project was that a steady deprec iation of the dollar of 1½ percent per year was sufficient to stabilize the ne t investm ent position. As the black line in the u pper lef t panel indicates, that conclusion is no longer valid. The red line on the chart indicates that even a 3 percent rate of depreciation is not quite enough. The m ain factors that change the basic result are shown in the upper right p anel o f the chart. First, th e dollar has appreciated substantially 2/2-3/99 30 relative to the baseline that was us ed in 1997. Second, the current account deficit over the last two years has be en above the 1997 baseline. Finally, our new higher estim ate of U.S. trend growth m akes a substantial difference b ecause the incom e elasticity of U.S. im ports is es timated to b e substantia lly higher than the incom e elasticity of the dem and for U.S. exports. The bottom  two panels of the char t show the net investm ent position to GDP ratio and real effective exch ange rates since 1980 for Canada and Australia. These are the only two m ajor industrial countries  that in recen t projecting f or the United States. In both cases their ex chan ge rates hav e trended dow n but with c onsiderable variation. That these projections have changed so m uch over the last two years is indicative of the fact that in such long-run proj ections initial conditions matter a lot. Moreover, there is no w ay to know, as the experience of Australia and Canada suggests, ex actly how large a country’s net investm ent position could be, nor when the prospect of further deterioration would prompt a fina ncial m arket reaction. But these projections do suggest that the poten tial problem for the dollar has gotten worse rath er than better over the la st two years, and the prospect of widening U.S. current account defic its is likely to exert downward pressure on the dollar at som e point in the future. Dave will n ow continue our presen tation.

MR. STOCKTON. Your next few charts focus on the aggregate supply side of the economy, beginning with a question raised at a num ber of recent m eetings, “Just how low is inflation ?” The upper left panel of Chart 11 displays the four-quarter cha nges in two alternative m easures of consum er prices, the PCE chain price index--the black line--and the CPI-­the red line. Prior to 199 5, these tw o indexes increased at roughly the same pace, on average. Since then, however, PCE inflation  has been running consistently below that of the CPI, with the difference last year about ¾ percentage point. For th e measures excluding food and energy, shown at the right, the gap was even la rger last year--about 1¼ percentage points. The m iddle left panel highlights the m ajor differ ences between the CPI and the PCE indexes. One im portant difference is the ag gregation formulas. The CPI uses fixed wei ghts at both the detailed and more aggregate levels, while the PCE inde x uses weights that vary with spending patterns from  period to pe riod. All told, these aggregation differences account for about three-four ths of the gap between the reported inflation rates over the past couple of years. 2/2-3/99 31 A second difference is the scope of the two indexes. The CPI covers the out-of-pocket expenditures of urban workers, while the P CE measure covers total consum er spending. For exam ple, PCE includes third-party paym ents of m edical costs by insura nce com panies and the governm ent. The PCE index also includes services  provided to individuals by nonprofit institutions. A third dif ference is tha t, while the P CE index is mostly constructed using com ponents of th e CPI, the BEA occasion ally us es price data from other sou rces. Most pro minently in recen t years,  they have b een using a measure of m edical serv ice prices th at has incre ased conside rably le ss tha n the correspo nding m easure in the CPI. Finally, the weights used in the i ndexes are developed from  different source data; the CPI uses spendi ng reported by households in the Consum er Expenditure S urvey, while the PCE weights are derived from various econom ic censuses. One notable  differen ce is that  the weight of housing in the CPI is considerably la rger than that in the PCE index. Because hou sing prices h ave been rising relatively  rapid ly, this  has given an added push to the CP I. To get a sense of the importance of the weighting and price differences, we recalculated the CPI using weights derived from the PCE data and the PCE’s m easure of m edical serv ice prices. As you can see by com paring the red and blue lines in the m iddle right panel, this exercise  suggests that about anothe r ¼ percentage point of the difference can be accounted for by these factors. The lower left panel lists som e of the pros and cons of the PCE price measure relative to the C PI. Clearly, as  a measure of the cost of living, the chain form ula of the PCE index is superi or to the fixed-we ight structure of the CPI, because it avoids substituti on bias. In addition, the PCE program has been m ore flexible in introdu cing new m easurem ent techniques, and the index can be revised to incorporate new source data. For exam ple, unlike the P CE index, the historical CP I data will never be revised to incorporate the geom etric m ean weighting th at will be introdu ced this year. That said, the PCE  price index does have one significant shortcom ing and that is its reliance on  imputed measures of service p rices for som e major com ponents. These imputations, about 3½ percent of the total index, are not actual m easures of  market prices, but rath er are BEA constructions, m ost using input co st inform ation of questionable reliability. These im puted prices have had a pr onounced effect on the pattern of PCE inflatio n of late. The deceleration in core P CE over the past year is almost entir ely attr ibuta ble to the sl owdown in imputed service prices. 2/2-3/99 32 As shown in the lower right panel, ex cluding these prices, the incr ease in core PCE was 1¼ percent last year, the sam e as in 1997. The bottom  line of our analysis is that consum er pri ce inflation almost certain ly has been running below the rates suggested by the CPI, but the extent of the slowing suggested by core PCE is considerab ly less certain. Of course, we think that even th ese low rates of m easured PCE inflation are still biased u pward; PCE prices suffer from  many of the sam e deficienc ies of  quality ad justm ent tha t afflict th e CPI. The shaded band in the upper left-hand panel of Chart 12 shows a one percentage point wide confidence interval around our estimate  of the upward bias in the PCE price index, which we put at about ½ percentage point pe r year . By this assessm ent, we m ay well have been at price stability last year. As m ay be seen, our projection anticipates som e turnaround in inflation over the next tw o years. By 2000, total PCE inflation picks up about one percentage point and the ch ange in core PCE increases by about ½ percen tage point. Some of the accel eration reflects our ex pectation th at imputed service prices will rebound  from  the unusually low increases of the past year. More im portant, we ar e anticipating som e reversal of the favorable influences that have been  helping to hold down inflation over the past couple of years. Food pric es--the black bars in the m iddle left panel--are expected to be a neutral in fluence. But, retail energy prices-­the red bars in the m iddle left pa nel--are projected to post m odest increases over the next two years, after plunging in 1998. Moreover, core non-oil im port prices--the m iddle right panel--are expe cted to register their first in creas es since 199 5. As Mike noted earlier, indicators of tautness in product and labor continue to diverge. As shown in the lower two p anels, that d ifference does not appear to be a statistical artifact. Business reports on vendor delivery perfor mance, the left panel, reveal few if any signs of production bottlenecks. In contrast, the percent of households that perceive jobs as plentiful--th e black line on the right-- exceed thos e reporting that jobs are hard to get--the red line--by a very w ide m argin. Turning to the upper panel of Chart 13, tight labor m arkets have been an im portant factor driv ing an acceleration of real wages, m easured here as ECI compensation per hour deflat ed by the nonfar m business price index. However, owing to low price in flation, hefty real wage gains have required only a m odest acceleration in nominal com pensation  over the p ast couple of years. To be sure, favorable  price shocks provided an extra boost to real wage growth that we are expe cting to recede as thes e influences are partly reversed in com ing quarters. But m ore fundam entally, we expect 2/2-3/99 33 the leg acy o f the recen t low inflation to  put a lid o n inflation expectations, and thus nom inal wage dem ands, de spite the tightness of labor m arkets. The sim ulations presen ted in the middle panel highlight som e risks surrounding this outlook. A model in which wages are a function of, among other variables, past consum er price inflation and the unem ployment rate--the dashed blue  line--pro jects incre ases in ECI compensation per hour that are even  lower than the staff projection. The picture is quite different, howev er, if wages are determ ined not by past price inflation or  inflation expectations, but rather by the past mom entum  in wage increases. A model with thes e chara cteristics--the red line--projects a substantial accelera tion in com pensation per hour over the next two years. Barring a further in crease in pro ductiv ity growth, a step-up in labor costs of this dim ension likel y could not be absorbed entirely in business profit m argins and would resu lt in m ore serious upw ard pressure on price inflation than is envisioned in our forecast. As you can see, the staff projection- -the black line--is shaded toward the wage-p rice m odel. We read the statistical ev idence as favoring th is specification , but our pro jection is above this m odel becau se we are skeptical that inflation expectations have fallen as m uch as suggested by this m odel’s straight reading of lagg ed prices. And, we rem ain im pressed by the anecdotal reports that wages are under upward pressure. In the lower panel, the staff projec tion for core PCE is com pared with two reduced-form  models in which price inflation depends on lagged prices and alternative m easures of resource utilization. The staff price projection--the black dash ed line in the lower pa nel-- is a bit higher than a reduced-form m odel using the unempl oyment rate--the red line--largely because we do not believe som e of the special factors that h ave held down core PCE, most notably the im puted services, will carry forward. An identical m odel that uses m anufact uring capacity utiliza tion a s the measure of resource utilization, the bl ue line, suggests a m ore serious departure from  the staff pr ojection. Over the long er haul, the em pirical evidence provides a slight edge to the unem ploym ent rate form ulation, though in the past couple of years th e capacity utilizati on m odel has been closer to the m ark. Taken together, the m odel results suggest that, while there m ay be som e upside risk to our wage projection that could well feed through to prices, the low expected rate  of factory utiliz ation im plies that the inflation risks are not one-sided. Your next chart reviews the productivity projection. As you know, last spring w e revised up our estim ate of trend productiv ity gr owth--line 3 in the upper panel--to 1.8 percent at an annual rate. As m ay be seen on line 4, the in vestm ent boom  of recent years has lif ted cons iderably the 2/2-3/99 34 pace of capital deepen ing--that is, the increase in capital per w orker. And, the ava ilable data hin t at som e step-up in the g rowth of multifactor productivity--line 6. The recen t behavior of labor produc tivity appears to have conf ormed reasonab ly well with ou r estim ate that  som e acceleration has occurred in the underlying trend. The m iddle panel shows our estim ate of trend productivity (the thin black line), actual  productivity (the thick black line), and a sim ulation of  a pro ductiv ity m odel tha t attempts to capture cyc lical variation around that trend (the red line). As can be seen, sim ulated productivity closely m atched actual last year. The recen t behavior of th e unem ploym ent rate als o provides s ome support for our productivity assum ption. The lower panel shows the actual unemploym ent rate--the black line--and a sim ulation of Okun’s law starting in 1990--the red line. As you can see, the sim ulation using our estim ate of potential output growth of  2.1 percent in the first half of the 1990s and 2.8 percent since then has tracked the unem ploym ent rate closely in recent years. While the recent data have been kinder  to this aspect of our projection than m any others, it’s far too soon to f eel confident. It should com e as no surprise that putting addi tional breaks in our estim ate of trend productivity improves the f it of these  equation s, and it is cer tainly poss ible that af ter we complete this business cycle our upward  adjustm ent of the trend will have proven too optim istic. On the other hand, if we are in the m idst of an ongoing im provem ent in the pace of technological advance or organizational efficiency, further upsid e surprises could be at hand. The greater productivity im plied by last Friday’s GD P release, if it should hold up through revisions, would provide  som e suppor t to that view. In assem bling this Char t Show, we briefly contem plated dispensing with a discu ssion of our baseli ne Greenbook forecast in favor of presenting only alternatives, given th at the experience of the past year might suggest that th is Greenbook’s alternative will be nex t Greenbook’s baseline. [Laughter] In the end, we decided not to take that approach, but your next chart is offered in that spir it. Perhaps one of the largest risks surrounding the perform ance of the dom estic econom y is associated with the course of the stock m arket. In this char t, I consider  the consequences of both a continued boom and of an abrupt bust in the m arket. In the boom  scenario, we have assumed that the gains in the stock boost the stock m arket--the blue line in the upper left pa nel--by 20 percent in each of th e next two y ears, all else  equal. Mon etary po licy is assum ed to respond to this shock accord ing to  the Taylo r rule. In con trast to ou r 2/2-3/99 35 baseline assum ption of no change in the federal funds ra te through the end of 2000--shown as the black line in the upper right panel--the stronger activity prompted by the boom ing s tock m arket results in a 100 basis point increase in the funds rate by the end of next year. This tightening of policy leans agains t the s trengthenin g of activity, but it is not prom pt enough or large enough to prevent the unem ploym ent rate--the lower left panel- -from falling be low 4 percent.  Despite tha t, the inf lation rate --the lower right panel--rem ains about unchange d from that in the baseline; in the m odel’s view, the increase in inte rest rates w ould boost the exchange value of the dollar enough to  offset the inflationary effects of tighter labor In the bus t scenario--sho wn as the re d line in all four panels--we have assum ed an increase in the equity prem ium that would, all else equal, produce a 4 0 percen t decline in the s tock m arket by the third quarter of this year. In this sim ulation, the Taylor  rule calls for a cut in the funds rate of 125 basis points by the end of next year. The unem ployment rate rises to 4¾ percent by the end of next year. Again, the inf lation rate is little changed from the baseline path. In constructing these scenarios,  I have deliberately kept the alternatives sim ple. In neithe r case have I allowed for any special disruptions to financial m arkets or  to the real econom y not already accounted f or by the structure of the m odel. However, if  eithe r scen ario were to m aterialize, it is not dif ficult to envision a considerab ly more chal lenging policy environm ent. For exam ple, a continuing bo om could, at som e point, spill ov er more noticeably into other asset m arkets--a dding extra stim ulus to activity and inflation. On the other hand, a steep decline in the stock m arket could have m ore adverse consequences for the behavior of capital m arkets and for credit provision than is em bodied in these sim ulations. Moreover, if such a decline were to trigger an ab rupt shift in the econom ic outlook of businesses or households, the risks of  a sharp cyclical downturn would increase m arkedly. The final chart presents your econom ic projections for 1999. The central tend ency of your forecasts sh ows expected growth of nom inal GDP of 4 to 4½ percent this year. This is accom panied by growth of real GDP between 2½ and 3 percent, leavi ng the une mploym ent rate in the 4 ¼ to 4½ percent range. The increase in the CPI is p rojected to b e in the neighborhood of 2 to 2½ percent. Mr. Chairm an, that concludes our presentation.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. That was a pa rticularly im pressive perform ance by the three of you. I thought it m ost interesting in all respects. I found the results of the 2/2-3/99 36 forecast s cenario that as sumes the largest ch ange in stock m arket prices s omewhat startling in the sense of how re strained the secondary effects were. If we look at the end result, we find that a stock m arket “bust” brings the unem ploym ent rate to just over 5 percent. Five or six years ago we thought 5 percent was just terrific, an exceptionally low number. The inf lation ra te in that s cenario is under 2½ percent. Again, that is som ething history would suggest is fully accep table. So, if som eone we re to say that a bust in stock percent, some m ight say “Bring it on!” That tells us som ething about our inability to create, with a lim ited nu mber of equations, som e of the history of past extraordinary events. As Dave Stockton pointed out, the en deavor to hold everything else the sam e is clearly m isleading. Were these types of shocks  to occur, I suspect the end results would be quite different. But it is very difficult to  capture exactly w hat those results would be. Nonetheless , I think the forecast ex ercise is sugg estiv e of the types of iss ues that are involved. Questions for our colleagues? 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I have a couple of questions. First, on Chart 1, the inflation rate as measured by the CPI goes up alm ost a percen tage point over the forecast h orizon. In your opening comments, Mike, you said that you were leaning toward giving som ewhat greater weight to labor m arket tightness in th e inflation picture. Yet, as I look at the projected perform ance of the CPI, it seem s to m e that it is m ostly dr iven b y the dissipation of the declines in energy prices. The effect of labor m arket tightness is there only m arginally in the n ext yea r. This year the la bor m arket tightness is s till being fully offset by other forces. Is that a fair statem ent? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. The rise in oil prices that we have assum ed is accounting for a very substantial p ortion of the overall CPI increase in the forecast. In think ing about the story in term s of underlying resource pressures, as Dave indicated, we have leaned m ore toward the unem ploym ent rate as the indicato r of resource pressures rather than capacity utilization. But the core price m easures de finitely do not acceler ate the way the overall CPI m easure does. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I had a question, too, about Chart 10, entitled “U.S. Current Account Sustainability.” You talked about the factor s that have affected the sustainability of the current account deficit since 1997, includ ing the appreciation of the 2/2-3/99 37 dollar and the deterioration of external accounts. It seem s that m any of these developm ents reflected cyclical phasing and th e crisis in Asia, for exam ple. So, I am wondering why at som e point in the future--whe n the cycles in the United States, Japan and Europe becom e more in phase and we ge t to the other side of  the Asian cr isis--w e won’t recoup som e of the losses in the curren t account. Are these transitory and related to the cyclical crisis or are th ey long-term  structural changes? 

[SECTION]

MR. ALEXANDE R. I think in part what  you are picking up are the initial conditions and com pounding effects. If we have  a cyclical swing that  makes the situation worse now and if the other econom ies com e back  later, we will in the interim  experience a further increase in our net external de bt positio n. And because of the co mpounding, that m atters.  An underly ing assum ption in the Greenbook forecast is that there will be some strengthening in fo reign econo mic activ ity during th e forecast period, but faster-than-trend g rowth abroad is delayed un til the period beyond the Greenbo ok horizon. So, part of the problem  is that if we have a boom  and therefore a bigge r trade deficit in the curren t acco unt now, we will ac cumulate additio nal foreign d ebt; and the inte rest cost of that will m ount. In part, therefore, the grow ing extern al def icit is  the effect of the compounding. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. That’s a very good point. Just one last comment: I was a little surprised in Chart 15 by the lim ited impact on inflation of whether there was a positive demand sur prise or a negative dem and surprise. The Taylor rule, with the exchange rate consequences, just offsets that. Was that not su rprising to you? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOC KTON. Yes, it was. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Okay. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Incidentally, as I think you are aw are, the im plicit assum ption for the crude oil price em bodied in  the forecast do es exceed th e price im plied by the forward futures market for the rest of th is year and next. If you had substituted the the CPI forecast? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. It would have taken a c ouple of tenths off the forecast. Our price is just a dollar or so hi gher than the m arket’s, so the ef fect would be a tenth or two. If one wanted to assum e that oil prices stay  flat going forward, th at would take another 2/2-3/99 38 couple of tenths off, roughly speaking. The assumptions we have m ade on both the import price side and on the oil price are critic al factors in explaining the upturn we have forecast in inflation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Ther e is a wage/price interaction, which m eans that the chan ge in the cru de oil p rice gives us a m ultiplier in the inf lation rate. Are you counting that in the 0.2 and 0.3 or are you doing just a direct accoun ting translation into the product prices in the CPI? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. We are doing th e full accou nting. On PCE price inf lation, flat oil prices and, let’s say, 1 percent slow er non-oil im port price inflation would take about 0.2 off the forecast we are sho wing in 1999 and 0.4 off in 2000, including all of the feedback effects. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. That is what I am getting at. It is a full simulation effect. I would presum e that if the price of crude oil went down, it would have even more of an effect. So, in a sense a not insignifi cant part of the forecast is dependent on an endeavor to m ake judgments abou t a very difficult issue. We do the best we can, but it is important to realize that we c ould be wrong on either side of that. We could very readily get an increase in W est Texas Interm ediate  to $15 a barrel, a nd that would m ake a difference; or it could go down to $9 a barrel a nd that would throw the whole forecast off. It is im portant for us to recognize that so we  can monitor this and make certain we m ake some good j udgm ents about where we are. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mike, I want to ask you a question about the perform ance of equity m arkets over the last several years. Typically, one talks about  that in term s of earnings and  P/E m ultiples. Does it m ake sense to focus on risk prem ia in equity m arkets and look at it from  the viewpoint suggeste d in som e of the studies by Ibbotson and Sinquefield? Those studies i ndicate that over the longer te rm there is a significant prem ium in equity m arkets in the se nse of  a greater return on equi ties th an on risk-fre e Treasur ies that is m ainly a ref lection of the risk prem ium. Is there reason to think that over this period as a result of persistent growth of earnings and volatility--perhaps almost all in one dir ection --that the m arket’s  percep tion of the risk in equity m arkets m ay have changed?  If that risk prem ium is com ing down, obviously a given tr ajectory of earnings 2/2-3/99 39 could have a powerful impact on the level of e quity prices. It’s a nother way of talking about P/E multip les that has a little  more analytical bas is, I think. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. It certainly has an analytical ba sis. It is an abs tract notion that is unmeasurable. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. That is why it’s wort h spending tim e talking about it. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Yes. One of the active hypothe ses is that invest or perceptions of the holding periods over which they need to as sess the volatility in d ifferent asse ts may have changed, so that investors are not as pr eoccupied with the grea ter sh ort-run vola tility of equities a s they were histor ically. Peopl e may have recogn ized th at they had been giving up excessive am ounts of yield historically by avoidi ng equities, given this new perception of risk. That m ight m ake higher valuations su stainable for given earnings trajecto ries and interes t rate le vels. That said, w e are real ly squeezing these things do wn by som e estim ates to very, very narrow risk m argins. And there is a certain euphoria that one senses in the m arkets; people m ay be exa ggerating the saf ety of equity investm ents. So if a shock occurs th at jars inves tors out of  this com placency, if that’s what it is, we could see a reversion to wider equity prem ia that, on top of more realistic earnings expectations, could result in a very marked ad justm ent of equi ty prices. I might note that the sim ulations that Dave Stockton presen ted were concocted basically by assum ing changes in the equity prem ium. So it is es sentially a totally autonom ous s hock of this sort th at lea ds to thes e numbers. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you. The bottom  panel of Chart 13 shows a set of projections, one of which uses the capac ity utilization equation. I believe you commented that recen t history would  seem  to be  a bit m ore consisten t with this view of the world. That raises in m y mind the f act that m anufacturing capacity focuses on a relatively narrow part of the econom y. Have  you thought about other factors that this measure m ight be picking up? Is it a proxy for som ething?  If you wanted to explain why it seem s to work, what explanation would you offer? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I would say it works principally because the m anufacturing sector is the most cyclical  com ponent of the entire econom y and therefore involves 2/2-3/99 40 enough variation to pick up som e correlation with what is going on in product m arkets more generally. It certainly am plifies, in  som e sense, what is happening in product portion of the econom y is precisely what m akes us hesitant to go the full distance tow ard this m odel. We know that in the current ci rcum stances, given what is happening to our trade accoun ts, there sho uld be special stre ss in the m anufacturi ng sector and that, therefore, it m ight not be as reliable an i ndicator of overall econom ic conditions as it has been in the past when we have not seen su ch disparate behavior between the goods sector and the rest of the economy. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I doubt that there is m uch that  I can add to Dave’s  expertise on this, but one thing we have talked  about among ourselves is whether the m odels that we use really pick up the im portance of the dolla r and import price move ments. Given the confluence of events recently and th e way they have im pinged on the m anufacturing sector, this a lternative is perh aps picking up a bigger im port-price effect th an is m anifest in the m odel sim ulation we have used for th e une mploym ent rate v ersion of  the Phillips curve. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What happens  if you use the GDP gap instead of the unem ploym ent rate ? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. The outcom e is quite close to the unem ploym ent equation results. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Doesn’t that address Pres ident Stern ’s question ? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. It does that except one has to rem ember that the way we construct the GDP gap is basically a versi on of Okun’s law. It is a little more complicated  than tha t, but it do es no t bring m uch additional infor mation to bear relative to what is already inco rporated in Okun’s law. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. In order words, these are two independent methods, and the com bination of the two doesn’t add anything? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I have a quick question of fact on financing conditions in the U.S. corporate bond m arket. I should know the an swer, but I don’t. Roughly speaking, what 2/2-3/99 41 fraction of the new issue s is at the lo wer-ra ted end and what fraction is at the highe r-rated end?  Your chart em phasizes the corporate junk bond rate, and that is up substantially. How im portant is that q uantitatively ? I’m  just asking for a ballpark figure on that. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. To be honest, I don’t have a good num ber in m ind. It has varied considerably over tim e. The table on page III-2 in Part II of the Greenbook shows the gross issuance of bonds by U. S. corporations in 1998. Sales of investm ent grade issues averaged $14 billion a month, whereas thos e at the speculative grade were $9.5 billion per m onth. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. So the percentage breakdown is roughly 60/40. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. If one wants to take into  account the degree to which these data represent refinancing, this becom es a tricky que stion to deal w ith. One of the problem s in trying to exam ine the changes we’ve seen in credit m arket conditions over the past year is that the variations depend not only on a firm ’s credit rating but on which institution it turns to for f inancing and also the maturity range. Take, for exam ple, a non-prim e borrower looking at bank loans, where the money m arket rates have been com ing down considerably. Even if the spread wide ned a bit--and it m ay not have yet--the firm might still b e borrowing more cheaply at a bank as opposed to  trying to sell securities in the bond m arket. The cost m ay not be unam biguously higher. It is a very dif ficult situ ation to a ssess. My judgm ent would be, taking the totality of th is picture go ing forward with our sto ck market assum ption, that we do hav e perhaps a m odest degree of overall financial restra int. But it is hard to read at this point, and thus you m ight not have discerned a clea r-cut bottom  line in m y presentation. I think it is a m ixed bag. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. We h ave fa irly d etailed inf ormation on the outstanding stock of debt by cred it ratings. I thin k the m edian is just at the edge of investm ent grade versus noninvestm ent grade. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I suspect so. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. I am back on the bottom  chart on Chart 13, and m y question is an offshoot to Gary S tern’s question. Ther e is a lot of uncertainty about the NAIRU. I believe your equations have it in the low to mid 5 percent area, perhaps 5.3 or 5.4 2/2-3/99 42 percent. This chart actually he lps to get at a question that I have worried about, which is: How im portant is that u ncertainty ? I think one m ight take the capac ity utiliza tion equation as a proxy for things a bout as they are now, as if we are roughly at the NAIRU. Your wage projections would be based on th e notion th at we are subs tantially be low NAIRU. So I think the answer to m y question is that over a period of a couple years we get about l percentage point m ore in inflation depending on whether this NAIRU assum ption is 5½ or 4½ percent.  Is that roughly correct? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOC KTON. Over this tw o-year period th at is exact ly in lin e with the basic rules of thumb, yes. It is certainly true th at ther e is enorm ous uncertainty in all thes e estim ates. Indeed, in term s of the capacity u tilization type equations , we are in essen ce below the model’s estimate for the natural ra te of capacity utiliza tion. It might even suggest, as this sim ulation indi cates, that there could be so me further downward pressure on inf lation if  that in f act were th e measure of ov erall res ource utilization. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. In the Bluebook, Governor Gr amlich, there is a sim ulation with a 4½ percent NAIRU, which does exactly what yo u said. The econom y is at equilibrium. Nom inal and real rates are where they need to be and inflation ends up about ¾ of a percen tage p oint lowe r than in the b aseline. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I fou nd the paper that you circulated on the PCE versus the CPI measures very interesting, and the charts ar e interesting as well. What I found m yself asking, however, was this: If price stabil ity is characterized by people not taking inflation into account w hen they are enga ging in decisions--along the lines of the Chairm an’s def inition of  price s tability-- it is not clear to m e which of these m easures does a better job of m easuring the inflation that people perceive and care about. For a long tim e we thought it was the CPI; in f act, I thought that was what the CPI was constructed to do. There obviously are technica l as well as nontechnical  reasons to prefer the PCE. But som e aspects of that m easure s eem very arcane to m e in term s of whe ther people really see what is going on. Have I m issed the point here som ehow? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I think the clearest area where the PCE h as that kind of problem  is that it includ es prices ass ociat ed with  nonprofit in stitutions such as relig ious organizations and other charitab le organizations. If prices  in those areas a re chang ing 2/2-3/99 43 because the statisticians are im puting  prices fo r labor costs an d so forth, I don’t th ink that affects anybody’s expectation very much. Clearly, one m ight argue that the nonm arket price portion of the PCE is not so relevant. On the other hand, I think that m ost peopl e probably are not looking only at their out-of-pocket expenditures in considering wh at is happening with the overall price situation. For exam ple, in the area of insurance costs they m ight very well care about third party paym ents or the part that the gove rnment is picking up. I view  the weighting structure in the PCE as clearly sup erior and probably closer to what m ost people perceive. It does not involve a fixed m arket basket of goods that people were consum ing five or six years ago but is m ore a period- to-period type of wei ghting structure that probably is much closer to what people perceive is happening. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Are you saying that the CPI or the PCE weighting is better? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. The PCE weighting is pr obably m ore appropriate and closer to most people’s think ing than the f ixed-weight structure of the CPI. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, let’s a ssum e that the C PI weighting is wrong, because it clearly is a sample  and people m ake very poor jud gments as to  what the weights are with respect to what  they spend. But that is ind eed what they think they are doing. The point is that thei r perception of the inflation rate m ay be wrong from  an econom ist’s point of view. But if you view  it in the context of  the point P resident Minehan is raising, it is an interesting questi on of whether their perc eption is the relevant one or not. Remember that in the University of Michig an Survey, for exam ple, their view of the rate of inflation is usually higher th an it is  in rea lity. The broader question is whose perception m atters--the perception of the business community or the consum er community? I thought the m emo demonstrated conc lusively that the true  rate of inflation is far better m easured by the PCE. But th e question you are raising is a different one. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes, it is a different one. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I would add just one co mment on that. Part of the difference in reporting in the consum er expenditure surv ey that is used for the CPI is probably deliberate. It is not necessarily a m isconcepti on. The fact is that consum ers significantly 2/2-3/99 44 underrepo rt their consu mption of alcoholic b everages and to bacco. Now, it cou ld very well be that they just don’t rem ember. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There is som e evidence that suggests that the m ore you drink, the less you rem ember! 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. And the less you care! 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. People certainly rem ember how much they paid for that last pack of cigarettes. I suspect that even if they are underweighting it  in the survey, it is on their minds.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. I want to ask abou t the last chart because it g oes into the Hum phrey-Hawkins report and does get som e attention from  the public. I was struck that the central tendency on the real GDP num bers and on the CPI num bers stayed the sam e as those we had last summ er but the nom inal GDP range went down. That im plies, I suppose, that our idea of what deflator is ap propriate was revised down compared to what we thought last July. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. We don’t get the m embers’ estim ates of the deflator. I must say that, when I look at the num bers you give us, I can see that in som e cases people are not distinguishing between the CPI and the deflator  in getting to the nom inal GDP number. People m ay have been on top of that more this time than at a prior tim e. There is, I think, a conside rable loos eness in th ese numbers. Also, we sim ply elim inate the high three and low three f rom the indiv idual d istributions to get the cen tral tendency and  there can be a lack of coherence across the com ponents in  som e instances. I don’t know whether that was the case, but that distortion can creep in.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, the Twelfth District econom y expanded at a strong pace in 1998  and entered  the new year with  subs tantial m omentum . Initial estim ates indicate that total payroll em ployment in the District grew by 2.7 percent last year, nearly ½ percentage point faster than the nation. Following a slow third quarter, District employm ent regained lost m omentum during the fourth quarter, when net hiring stepped up noticeably in the retail tr ade and construction sectors. However, the District’s employm ent growth rate in 1998 was about one p oint below its 1997 pace and our gro wth rate advantage over the nation fell substantia lly. The key weak spot was the durables manufacturing sector, w hich was hindered by de terioration in the District’s East Asia export perform ance. Among subs ectors, a sharp contraction in  the aircraft and parts m anufacturing sector has begun, with 3,600 jobs lost during the fourth quarter in W ashington State and another 1,800 jobs lost in Los Angeles Count y during the past year . Manufacturers of computers and other h igh-tech equip ment al so had to face a slowdown. As a resu lt, employm ent in the San Jose m etropolitan porti on of the San Francis co Bay area was flat during m ost of 1998. Despite the slowdown in durables m anufact uring in California, wage and salary growth in the state has been sustained by the creation of high-wage jobs in other sectors of the California economy. The largest contri bution cam e from finan ce, insurance, and real estate, which grew rapidl y in 1998. Among other states, Nevada and Arizona were at the top of the national employm ent growth ranking in 1998, and grow th during the fourth quarter surged in Oregon, Utah, and Idaho, wh ere it had fallen nearly to a standstill earlier in the year. Turning to the national econom y, our  outlook has changed little since the 2¾ percent this year and unchanged core CPI in flation of 2½ percent or  slightly less b oth this year and next. Along with the expected slowdown in growth, we have an assumption of an unchanged stock m arket price level, reflec ting th e rand om-walk nature of stock prices. In fact, the waning of the expansionary  effect of past incr eases in stock m arket prices contributes to slower consumption growth this year . I suppose I should m ention 2/2-3/99 46 that we forecasted a sim ilar growth slowdow n last year, along w ith an unchanged stock It is not hard to think of  developm ents that could a lter this year’s outcome. Recent prob lems in Brazil serve to rem ind us  of the potential downside ris ks stemm ing from  fragility in m any Asian and Latin Am erican  countries, as well as their im plicatio ns for international and dom estic f inancial m arkets. But on the other side, last Friday’s data on econom ic activity in the fourth quarter followed the fa miliar pattern of stron g output growth and low inflation. It seem s more and m ore likely that our econom y is benefiti ng from  a more rapid expans ion of potential GDP, probably due to advances in technol ogy. In fact, our staff has looked at a consum ption-based m easure of potential GDP, wh ich has the potential to pick up shocks to the supply side of the econom y. It shows a considerably faster expansion in potential output last year than do conventional m easures. This factor also would help to explain why inflation has been so well behaved in the face of strong labor m arkets and why the stock m arket has been so strong. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Seventh District econom y generally co ntinues to sh ow trends sim ilar to what I repo rted in Decem ber, nam ely strength in consum er spending and housi ng activity, m ixed signals in m anufacturing, tight labor m arkets, and a f ew signs that in flation will ac celerate in the n ear future. Consum er spending rem ains healthy, boosted in part by robust activity in the housing sector, including re financing activity. Two of our directors, one a m ajor bank cr edit card issuer and the other a m ajor retailer, reported that consum ers have been  paying down outstandi ng credit balances, in part reflecting strong mortgage refinancing activity. Most of our retailers experienced better-than-expected sales during Decem ber, and that continued into January. Sales have been particularly strong for big-ticket item s such as appliances, consum er electronics, and cold weather products. The blizzard we ha d in early 1999 forced som e merchants to close stores tem porarily, but th e impact on sales for the m onth was said to be m inimal. Light vehicle sales were in the stratosphere in Decem ber but cam e back to earth in 2/2-3/99 47 weather crimped sales a bit in January, but sales continued to be boosted by high incentives. Autom akers have rev ised 1999 sale s forecasts up ward, althou gh they still are not quite as high as in the Greenbook. Continued strength in the m otor vehicl e industry, including heavy trucks w here there is a 13-m onth order backlog, stands in sharp contrast to the weakness still being reported in our steel and agri cultural equipm ent industries. In the steel industry, two small fir ms declared ban kruptcy last year. Three more m ay do so in the first quarter of this year. A couple of recently op ened m ini mills are now up for sale. Among the m ajor steel producers, half were still profitable in the fourth quarter , but all are likely to lose money in the first quarter. This will m ake it easier f or the in dustry to d emonstrate in jury from  steel imports. Production in the farm  equi pment industry this year  is expected to be down 25 percent. Moreover, since Brazil is a major soy bean produ cer, the devaluation of the real w ill like ly put downward pressure  on prices and e xacerba te co nditions for our soy bean farm ers and ag equipm ent m akers. District labor m arkets generally rem ain tight, although som e easing is reported in locales affected by weak ness in certain m anufacturing sectors and in agriculture. In terms of prices, firm s continue to report that  as a result of inte nse dom estic and foreign competition they la ck the  ability to ra ise pr ices. Firms continu e to pres s supplie rs for lower prices , and we had several repo rts recen tly of larger firm s, both within the s ame industry as well as across different industr ies, establishing purchasing alliances to increase their bargaining power with suppliers. But som e firms have m anaged to increase prices. Magazine advertising prices have been raised 5 percent. Also, several of our directors expressed concern about highe r prices for construction projects. I asked our directors to report on 1999 capit al spending plans. It appears that a few of our District firm s altered their capital  spending plans in response to last fall’s financial m arket turm oil. Changes th at have been m ade appear to be driven by prospective business conditions. Y2K issues are not driving change s in th eir cu rrent plans at the mom ent. Turning to the nation, our outlook f or econom ic activity in 1999 has strengthened somewhat since our Decem ber m eeting. Our an alysis sugg ests that real GDP growth will be around 2. 6 percen t this year and th at CP I inflation will b e about 2.3 percent. Our 2/2-3/99 48 forecast is sim ilar to the Greenbook’s, a lthough the Greenbo ok has trav eled a greater distance to get there than we did. Last week we m et with our Academ ic Advisory Council. They continue to look for a strong econom y in 1999, with inflation remaining around 2½ percent. Though they indicated that the curr ent setting of monetary  policy is about right for now, they expect inflation to accelerate so mewhat in the year 2000. I share th is concern about accelerating inflation. As we have discussed before, th e special factors that  led to the 1998 CPI inflation rate of 1½ percent are not likely to  recur this year. Since we see aggrega te demand dec elerating only to the growth rate of potential output, re source im balances are unlikely to dim inish soon. Last fall there were very real concern s that the f inancial turm oil cou ld neg atively affect creditworthy borr owers and in stitutions. This Comm ittee’s agg ressive ac tions were an appropriate response to those shocks . But if and when those risks dim inish sufficiently, an appropriate re sponse would be to move to ward a m ore neutral policy setting. The uncertainties about  the Brazilian situation probabl y mean that it is still too early to tell if its financial crisis has passed, but w e may not be too far from knowing.

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an. The situation rem ains about the same in Ne w England. Labor m arkets are ti ght, with the regional unem ploym ent rate at 3.2 percen t in Decem ber. Connecticu t and R hode Island reported the two largest d eclines in unem ploym ent a mong the nation’s states in  the m onth, and both st ates achieved new lows for this  decade. Job growth co ntinues to be slower than  that for th e nation as a whole, as it has been for m ost of 1998, and a wide array of businesses complain that a lack of workers, skilled and unskilled, ham pers growth. Even m anufacturing firm s that are shrinking noted that labor m arkets are tight . Term inated workers do not rem ain out of work for long. One fir m used furloughs around the holidays to avoid layoffs. They 2/2-3/99 49 feared that layoffs woul d cause them to lose  workers to other businesses and that they would face search, recru itment, and traini ng co sts to get new employees when they needed them . Consum er prices rose m easurab ly faster in Boston than for the nation as a whole throughout the year, with prices of food and medical care rising m arkedly faster--at a pace at least twice as fast in Boston as in the n ation. However, tigh t labo r markets and local price pressures did not seem  to lead to  rising wages generall y, at least in 1998. But we continue to see large prem iums being paid  for workers in various  skilled occupations. At least part of the success in holdi ng wages down has involved increased investm ent in capital goods. A wide range of firm s, from  dairy farm ers to jewelry manufacturers, repo rted that they were incr easing capital spen ding as  well as engaging in in-house training and offering m ore incentive pay to offset the rising co st of labor and to make such labor m ore productive. Interestin gly, while both retail ers and m anufacturers expect a slower 1999, most reta ilers and about half of the region’s m anufacturers expect significant capital expansions in 1999. Real estate and credit m arkets are healt hy. Residential real estate indicators exceed tho se of a year ago, with the m arket for newly built h omes in the greater Boston area very strong and prices up sm artly. On the comm ercial side, the speculative wind was taken out of the sails of developers a nd financers starting in the spring of 1998, after the supervisory warnings on REIT lending. Major developers and lenders both tell m e that securitization m ay now be playing a ro le in stabilizing real es tate cy cles. The sp eed with which the m arket corrects th e cost of financing m akes projects less feasible m ore quickly than  the m ore tra dition al process used by commercial mortgage ba nkers, who I am told never saw a building project they didn’t love. More broadly, credit spreads, while wide r than at earlier poin ts last year, do not seem  to be shutting out borrowers. Moreover,  lenders across a broad range of financial firms in Boston report very good con ditions for their own pro fitability. One larg e insu rer reported very solid yields on lending activity an d the lowes t rate of delinq uencies in at least a decad e. Finally, am id the doom  and gloom  of repor ts about the U.S. agricultural industry, there is a bright spot. New England’s dairy industry is reporting the best year ever. This 2/2-3/99 50 is due to higher m ilk prices and low er cost s for feed and other--I should hesitate to use this term --inputs. [Laughter] Even in da iry farm ing, however, there is a shortage of workers. One contact, a cheese m anufacturer , is running his cut-an d-wrap operation on a 7-day-a-week schedule and is speeding up installation of labor-saving devices. On the natio nal scen e, the data we deve loped for our Hum phrey-Hawkins forecast for 1999 differ very little from  those in the current Greenbook, although w e, like Chicago, had a little less far to travel. We, too, project a flat  stock m arket and stable oil prices, and we see consum ption and busine ss spending slow ing to about half the 1998 pace. Our forecast of overall GDP growth is a bit high er than the Green book’s and the unem ployment rate drops a bit even from  its current low level. The continuing pressure in labor m arkets and the flatte ning of oil prices produce a m odest rise in inflation, with both the core and the overal l CPI rising to just below 3 percent by year-end 1999. In view of this,  for the Humphrey-Hawkins for ecast we have projected a modest tigh tening in mid to late 1999 and probably would see an other m odest tightening in 2000 as well. Even with th is, it is hard to im agine a m ore sanguine forecast than either o urs or the Greenbook’s. One has to wonder whether eith er is just too good to be true. We have all talked ab out upside and downside risks to Greenbook forecasts for th e past year. However, the risks tha t have m aterialized a ll seem to have been on the upside. We have seen lots of growth, which is good, but lots of  upward pressure on asset prices and labor capital m arkets seem  to have resum ed financ ing just about anything, albeit with greater spreads than  earlier las t year and with in creased volatility. Some fragility in thes e facing in October. Arguably, monetary policy is stim ulative, given the available liquid ity in m arkets and the reduction in real interest rates brought about by th e 75 basis points of easing in the fall. The question we have to ask is whet her w e really want to stim ulate the economy right now or whether it m ight be prudent to bring policy closer to neutral, recognizing how difficult it m ight be to m easure where neutra l is. I do not say that because of a near-term threat o f inflation. I say it b ecause whether o ne thinks we face risks o n the down-side from  a large m arket break or from an international situation, or on the upside from 2/2-3/99 51 continuing pressures on labor capacity and wages, stim ulative policy right now seem s to run a greater risk of m aking things w orse la ter in term s of a big drop in the m arket--a bursting of the asset bubble, if there is one--o r more price pres sures,  if and when they begin to build.

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The regional econom y was very strong in the fourth quarter of last year, but that no doubt refl ected the weakness at midyear associated with  the auto strike. But it is crea ting wh at I think of  as a ski jump effect. Inevitably we are going to reach a poi nt where people’s expectations are going to be disappointed. The anecdotal reports suggest  that people are expecting 1999 to be a stronger year than 1998, but that m ay just be a reflection of how strong autos, construction, and other sectors were as we finished the year. We are told  that the bac klog of presold, not-yet-built hous es is at reco rd levels and w as rising as of year-end. Constructio n em ploym ent this year is expected, by the cons truction trade un ions anyway , to exceed the leve ls recorded in 1998. Overall, the labor m arkets continu e to be very tight. One of the large regional banks that operates in a num ber of states in the G reat Lak es region said that as of the end of last summ er they had 3,000 open position s. In order to cut that, they significan tly increased their use of retention bonuses. For example, any teller who was on the payroll on Septem ber 1, 1998 will g et a $1,0 00 cash bon us if he or s he is still on the payro ll on happened after tellers get their bonuses! The company also was planning an across-the-board increase of 4 to 5 percent in base wages for 1999. Reports from people in the retail sector alm ost never square with the subsequent data. That m ay reflect overcapacity in that  sector or it m ay just be unrealistic expectations by the people in the sector. The retailers co mplained in December about warm  weather hurting sales; then they com plained in January about cold weather hurting sales. Even in the last w eek of December they were say ing th at retail sales were soft o r disappointing and they subsequently reported that it was the best Christm as since 1984. 2/2-3/99 52 A directo r from  the retail sect or says that no m atter what hap pens in 1999 , we will hear retailers saying that it was not as good as 1998. Bankers report that C&I loan dem and is very strong. One of the regional banks said th at at the end of the year loans in th e pipeline were at the highest level ever, and they ar e now able to im prove the ir profit margins. Earlier in  the yea r they felt the ir Even the hard-hit s teel in dustry s truck a not e of optim ism recently. Steel prices in the fourth quarter of last year were said to have been down 6 percent on average from a year earlier but som e view that as the botto m. That m ay be wishful thinking. And it was asserted th at steel im ports, especially  from Japan, had peaked som etime last fall and are now declining. With consum ption last year at  a record and expected  to be as high or bette r this year, steel ind ustry executives are starting to tu rn optimistic. I agree with what Mike Prell said about the ear nings num bers. LTV reporte d a big loss for the fourth quarter, but even they ar e less bearish going forward. Turning to the national econom y, I have the same problem  with this Greenbook as I have had with other recen t ones, es pecially for the Hum phrey-Hawkins projection period, in th at I like the Greenbook forecast; I just  don’t b elieve it. I continue to want to believe it because it looks so good. For the f irst meeting of  the year, I look back over the fore casts of the last several years. This f orecas t is no w the highes t current year forecas t for rea l growth that we have had, at 2.6 percent on a fourth- quarter-to-fourth-quarter basi s. That looks really good. It’s higher than last year’s 2.4 percent. The year before it was 2.4 percent and in 1996 I think th e forecast at th e first m eeting of th e year was only ab out 1.8 percent for the f our-quarter period. Growth substantially  exceeded that initial forecast in each  of the last three y ears and inflation cam e in lower than p rojected. It’s hard to beat that. It’s easy to say: I want more of the sam e--faster growth, lo wer inflation. This is  the first tim e in the last couple of years, though, wh ere the unem ploym ent rate is not  rising in the current year and the out year. I also like that outcom e, but I doubt that, given what we inherited f rom 1998, we have conditions in place that will pr oduce that result agai n. Certainly in m y region, but I think nationally as well, a si gnificant portion of the surge in econom ic activ ity ref lected an a cceleration of  final de mand--fueled by what I consider to be very 2/2-3/99 53 rapid growth in all of the reserve, m oney, and credit m easures--to a pace that was associated in part with larg e and growing current account def icits. That, as the Chart Show illustrated, gave th e appearance of a vi rtuous cycle of rapid growth,  strong dem and, and low inflation that cannot be sustained. Some com ponents of that are going to start to revers e on u s and will g ive us a disappointing result of less o utput and m ore inflation . The longer we wait to start to rein in som e of the nom inal aggregate incom e growth and spending growth, the longer we ar e subsequently going to have to endure a period of very weak growth in output and em ployment in ord er to lean ag ainst the r ise in inflation. So, at som e point we have to cont emplate an adverse transitory tradeoff, and I think th e sooner the b etter.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. For the sake of variet y let m e start off by saying that not everything is great in our Distri ct. Agriculture is hurting in our region as elsewhere. The dairy farm ers, as in Cathy Minehan’s District , are doing better than the others, but overall the agricultu ral secto r is very weak. Currency depreciations in a num ber of com peting countries have really hammered apparel m anufacturers in the Carolin as, and there have been som e significant layoffs in that industr y. So, we have a few holes in our region. But, by and large, our District economy is probably as robust now as at any tim e I can remember in m y career. Even in m anufact uring, which apart from  agriculture is the weakest sector of our region, there are pockets  of strength. The furniture industry in Virginia and the Carolinas, which has been  in the doldrum s for a long tim e, has been revived to a rem arkable degree by the stre ngth of new and existing hom e sales. Elsewhere, consum er sentim ent and spending rem ain very strong essentially across the b oard. We had a good holiday se lling season, acco rding to the anecdotal inform ation anyway. There is a lot of sp eculative building in the W ashington region, especially around Dulles Airport, and in seve ral other cities in our District, notably Charlotte. Labor m arkets rem ain very tight ex cept in th e are as I m entioned a little ea rlier where there are som e layoffs. State unem ploym ent rates are below 4 percent in four of our six jurisdictions. Generally, the picture is pretty strong. Let m e make m y comments on the nationa l econom y in the context of our Bank’s Hum phrey-Hawkins forecast. We are asked to s ubmit a forecast bas ed on what we 2/2-3/99 54 regard as an appropriate mone tary policy. I have always ha d a little dif ficulty with tha t procedure b ecause in so me situation s I am  not at all su re that the Comm ittee, in its wisdom , is going to adopt what I personally think is appropriate m onetary policy. It usually does not do that. [Laughter] In that  case, my projection would be m isinterpreted if som ebody thought it was a statem ent of what  I think is the most  likely actual outcom e for the econom y over the year. So, a little less ambiguous a nd perhaps more informative way to proceed in m y view would be sim ply to  assum e that there is not going to be any change in po licy, and that is what I h ave done  in generating o ur forecast this year. As it turns out, of course, that is the sam e assum ption as the one underlying the Greenbook projection, but we do use a different model to  derive ours, nam ely a s mall six-equation VAR model. We get broadly sim ilar but somewhat different results: Our real GDP growth projection is 3 percen t as against 2½ percent in the Greenbook; and we have a somewhat higher inflation rate of 2½ percent. At first glan ce, as we have been saying, both our numbers and those of the Greenbook look pretty good. But the 2½ percent CPI inflation rate we are project ing, while obviously a big im prove ment over what we had not too m any ye ars ago, still worries m e. That is really the m ain point I want to m ake today. The Labor Departm ent has now corrected  about ½ percentage point of the 1 percentage point upward bias in the C PI that  is us ually a ssociated with th e Boskin Comm ittee Report results. So our 2½ percent CPI projection is equivalent to an unbiased projection of 2 percent, which I personally  believe should be the upper bound of our tolerance range for inflation going f orward. That seem s to m e as good a place as an y to draw the line on inflation, given where we are now. In this regard, it is worth noting also that  the core CPI rate increased from  2.2 per cent in 1997 to 2.6 percent in 1998 on a consis tently m easured basis, which is not an inconsiderable m ove in the wrong direction. The lower PCE inflation numbers certainly are com forting to som e degree, and I enjoye d the discussion about that today. But the fact is- -and this is related  to what Cathy Minehan was saying- -the CPI is s till the na tion’s inflation standard. I think it, m ore than a ny other m easure of inflation, drives people’s expectations and perceptions of  aggregate inflation in the country. So for now, at least until that ch anges, it seem s to m e that the CPI is  what we should focus on. 2/2-3/99 55 I would add just two quick final points. First, las t fall’s ¾ percentage point reduction in the funds rate was done because  unsettled financial m arket conditions threatened to restrain ag gregate demand in  the f uture, bu t the negative shock did not really m aterialize. I am not sure that the im plications of  this are captured in our own model’s es timation and hence in ou r forecast that I jus t sum marized. If not, then ou r forecast m ay understate and underestim ate the poten tial lagged stim ulus that could still be coming in the m onths ahead from  last fall’s eas ing. That could hit th e eco nomy at a tim e when it is already in full stride. That, to m e at least, rep resents a clear up side risk. Second, M2 growth last year overshot the top of its target range by 4 percentage points; if I am correct, that is  the biggest overshoot by a substantia l margin since the late 1970s or m aybe 1980. I recognize that som e of this problem  is due to anom alous factors affecting m oney dem and. But keep in m ind that our m oney targeting procedure--and here is a bla st from the past- -still allo ws base  drift. So last ye ar’s ove rshoo t will now b e ratified by the targ eting procedur e. That bi g potentia l monetary im pulse will still be out there as we move through 1999, even if we are able to keep M2 growth within whatever target range we set for 1999. So, bottom  line, I think the balance of risks in the outlook has now shifted back to the upside.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. I could just say that th e District econom y is doing well and that the risks to the nation al econom y are balance d, bu t I will bow to Comm ittee trad ition and elaborate so me. The regional econom y in the Philadelphia Di strict rem ains strong and, if anything, has picked u p a little strength recently. Manufacturing has accelerat ed in recen t week s, following several m onths of deterioration. Retail sales have held up, with notable strength in autos. Hom e building has been  on the rise. Commercial construction is doing well without the em ergence of the kind of boo m/bust signs that have  characterized the industry in past expansions. Labor markets remain tight. There are layoffs am ong som e of the larger firm s, but s maller firm s are hungry for e mployees. Large signing bonuses for som e job specialties such as programme rs are common, but general wage pressures are not show ing through in the form  of higher prices. 2/2-3/99 56 Looking ahead, m ost bus iness people f eel confident about the outlook for 1999, but on the w hole they expect a less robust year than in 1998. The risks to the national outlook are still broadly balanced with perh aps a shade m ore upside than downside risk because of the m omentum from  domestic dem and com ing into the new year. Nonetheless , the downside risks are there, mostly in the f orm of potentia l turm oil emanating from  international developm ents. With inflation low and not likely to accelerate q uickly, we h ave the luxu ry of watching and waiting.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Sixth District has begun 1999 on a moderate growth path, consistent with a healthy and balanced e xpansion. Residential building has m oderated, at least for the m oment , but that should be offset by a healthy commercial real estate sector . Factory activity w as sluggish again in December, and new orders and production are soft com pared to a year ago. However, the outlook indicators from  our latest survey are positive. The streng th is in th e hig h-tech area. The exceptions are apparel and paper, which continue to be weak, but that is not a new story. As for our important tourism  industry, in  recent m eetings I have noted som e sluggishness in future bookings but the outlook is prom ising this tim e. While there was some disappointm ent regarding the traffic over the year-end holiday season and som e continuing concern about a falloff in Latin Am erican visitors, the Super B owl provided a big shot in the arm . And dom estic tourists  with money to spend fleeing the cold weather in the North should ensure a strong first quarter . Airline flights to Florida and the Florida resorts are fully booked through February, and the cruise industry is bullish on 1999 due to strong bookings. Low energy prices continue to pose a pr oblem  for Louisiana. The rig count The only clues about capital spending plan s in the region com e from  our Decem ber manufacturing survey. It showed that expect ed capital expenditures six months out were more positive than in Novem ber. About one-thi rd of our respondents sa id they expect an increase in capital outlays  over the com ing period. Consisten t with the na tional pr ice d ata, pr ice inflation in th e District gen erally remains subdued. However, as others have sa id, labor m arkets rem ain tight; and we are 2/2-3/99 57 now getting reports of growing wage pressure s, with in creases in the 15 to 20 percen t range being necessary to retain key employees with certain specific skills. It is no t clear to us whether these wag e gains are being fully picked up by th e ECI data b ecause m any of the increases are in areas other than re gular wages, such as incentive pay, prem ium pay, and bonuses. The only other area where we c ontinue to get report s of price increases is health care, as others have noted. Brazil’s problem s have worsened the outl ook for the District’s exports to Latin America, damping earnings prospects for regi onal com panies investing he avily in tha t part of the w orld. Although not huge in the total schem e of things in 1997, com panies based in the Southeast ex ported $2.6 billion to  Brazil, accounting for about 20 percent of the value of the nation’s shipm ents to that coun try. We think Florida is th e state with the largest exports to Brazi l, with about two-fifths of th e value of the state’s shipm ents attributable to com puter equipm ent, electronics, and transportation. At the national level concerns clearly rem ain about the international sector. I will turn to that in just a m oment. I suggested  last tim e that I saw a danger in having our attention diverted from  the stronger-than-s ustainable growth and the inflationary pressures that m ay now be build ing within th e domestic econom y. I am no less concerned n ow than I was at the last m eeting. Although our judgm ental forecast, like that of the G reenbook an d most others, sees som e slowing in the pace of growth over 1999, as of yet there are few m easurable signs of that slowing. Our concern that growth projections of our Bank’s econom etric m odel. That new VAR m odel, which has tracked the perform ance of the econom y quite well over recent years, is  now suggesting a significant upturn in inflation during 2001 to a rate approach ing the 4 percent level as measured by the CPI. Importantly, that m odel also suggests that a si gnificant increase in the federal funds rate--to a level above what we may be com fortably willing to contem plate--will be required to keep in flation at even a 3 percent pace. While I am  not cam paigning for a monetari st label, I would also note that the growth of the m onetary aggregates shows no signs of abating and in  fact continues to accelerate. The longer that continues, the gr eater the risks m ay be of an outbreak of inflation. I expressed the view last tim e that with the lags that we know exist, the 2/2-3/99 58 implications of this relatively long period of strong m oney growth m ay not yet have shown through in our inf lation m easures. Governor Rivlin also m ade som e observations about lags at our last m eeting, suggesting that for a nu mber of reas ons we m ay now have the luxury of waiting long er to institute needed policy changes because th e econom y has becom e more responsive to shocks than it was previously. That hypothesi s piqued our curiosity and we attem pted to investigate it a bit. We did so by exam ining differences in  the im pulse responses in our model, estim ated over different periods of  time. Indeed, as was hypothesized, that modeling work does suggest a faster response recently to real side shocks than was the case previously, although the quant itative response to those shocks appears to be sm aller. At the sam e time, we found no evidence that there was any change in the econom y’s response to monetary policy shocks, which c ontinue to work with  long lags, requiring over two years for 80 percent of  the total response to be reflected in m easures of inflation. Obviously, we have a lim ited num ber of recent data points from which to do such m odeling but, in addition to the other r easons I suggested for cau tion, the results of that work are flashing caution lights f or me. Turning very briefly to international developm ents: W e have followed recent problem s in Brazil with special care, given the ongoing bank supervision work we do in Latin Am erica, working with central banks a nd other supervisory aut horities. Early in the yea r my staf f was telling m e that the m ajor key to possible developm ents in Brazil lay in whether authorities could e ngineer an orderly depreciati on of the currency and whether it cou ld be a ccommodated peacefully  by Brazi l’s multila teral creditors. We did not expect that the depreciation would com e so soon or that the value of the real would been m uch spillov er effect to o ther countries as might have been expected. After initial authorities have assured th at peso/dollar convertibility  would be m aintained, and Venezuela does not appear to be under substant ially m ore pre ssure th an it was prior to the Brazilian problem s. Moreover,  trade ties with Br azil and the rest of  Latin  America, except f or Argentina, ar e relatively lim ited. 2/2-3/99 59 In summ ary, the in terna tional situatio n certainly rem ains fragile, and we could have to contend with the shock of worseni ng problem s in Brazil, added contagion from the Brazilian problem , or both. Having said  that, I don’t think we should give undue weight in our policy deliberations  at this m eeting  to what cou ld happen in that part of the world and too little weight to the still very strong dom estic econom y, given inflationary tendencies that have been identified by bot h the Greenbook and the independent work at some of our Reserve Banks.

MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Kansas City District continues to do well and its econom y is basically sound. Our weak areas continue to be agriculture and energy, and there has been som e slowdow n in certain areas of our m anufacturing sector. Of course, there is som e concern on the m anufacturing side  about the Brazilian situation, particularly if that were to sp read to Mexico, on which we are much m ore dependent. Having said that, th e econom y otherwise is doing very well even in som e of the m anufac turing sectors as well as in the housing sector and cons truction generally. Retail sales continued strong, even in January. Overall, ou r major cities are still boom ing. On the national front, I exp ect the econom y’s growth to m oderate toward trend this year with low inflation, as others have said. In other words, basically we see the econom y continuing to g row. The issue we face continues to be very stro ng dom estic demand set against the backdrop of weak international demand, which is further complicated by the possibility of adverse shocks . That has not change d much in the la st several m onths. Nevertheless, com pared to la st fall I believe that the risks to the outlook are now far more balanced because o f the earlier  rate reductio ns taken to o ffset the glo bal financial turmoil. As a result, as others he re have indicated, I am  becom ing m ore focused on the poten tial upside risk to inf lation if we continue to m aintain our current m onetary stance. To m e, a key issue for this Comm ittee at this m eeting or very soon is whether, when, and how fast the policy actions of  last fall should be unwound. Thank you.

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The e conom y of the Ninth District remains strong outside of som e parts of ag riculture and m ining. But aside from  that, 2/2-3/99 60 consum er spending is continuing to expa nd, construction is very strong, and labor that is a term I do not use often. As just one  indication of that, th e unemploym ent rate in the Twin Cities m etropolitan area is now a bout 1½ percent, which obviously m eans that everybody who wants a job has one or probably several. So that area is going along very well. There are wage pressures but selective ones. They tend to be for some entry-level position s, for som e infor mation technology professionals, an d so forth, but they by n o means see m to be generalized. When we ask business people whether they are seeing inflation or deflation, the an swer we get back m ost frequently is “neither.” The one thing that gives m e real pause about the District econom y--and it is a little disconcerting--is that bankers still seem  to be  chasing deals very a ggressively. That is my general sense from  conversations with th em and with some of their custom ers. As far as the national econom y is concer ned, let m e say first that I was impressed with both the num ber and the variety of the scenarios presented in the Greenbook, the Bluebook, and in this afternoon’s presentation. I believe they help us think about the risks and ab out how we ultim ately m ight want to be positioning m onetary  policy. But an equally intriguing question is the reasonablen ess, or the accuracy, of the baseline forecast. In that regard, I would say that I am a bit m ore optim istic about real g rowth in 1999. That is as a consequence of both th e momentum  behind aggregate dem and as we go into th e year and also because I am more positive abou t productiv ity trends and, therefore, the supply side. So, I think we m ight see som ewhat greater real growth than in the Greenbook. Another reason for being positiv e about the real outlook is that our VAR forecasting model is quite positive. It has been reasonably accurate in 1 996, 1997, and 1998, so it is harder to dism iss the model forecast than it used to be sin ce it is bu ilding up a bit of a track record. I agree with the Greenbo ok’s view of a m odest uptick in inflation m ainly because I think ther e will be som e unwinding  of the ef fects of  the f avorable sho cks that we hav e experienced in recent years. But I m ust say the anecdotes abo ut essen tially no inf lation give m e some pause as I think about that.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Rivlin. 2/2-3/99 61 

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN. I am glad I stim ulated rese arch in  Atlanta. I am interes ted in seeing it. A couple of m eetings ago I referred to th e cheerful little el ves who run the U.S. econom y and get their kicks out of proving the cautious forecasters wrong. The only thing that can be said about the econom ic news since our la st meeting is that the elves have scored again. When I heard that th e estim ate of the 1998 fourth-quarter GDP was likely to be about 5 percent, I said, “Wow!” Then the official estim ate turned out to be 5.6 percent with the pos sibility of an upward revision to perhaps over 6 percent. The elves clearly have been working overtim e and they have gotten m ore ingenious. They have figured out how to c ontro l the weather,  at least temporarily, and how to keep productivity growth increasing when any reasonable elf would suspect that all the reeng ineering and  restructu ring and co mputerizing that could be done had been done already. Most amazing of all, they seem  to have figured out how to keep unem ployment rates lower than what the NAIRU  enthusiasts have said for a long tim e is the drop-dead rate, while wage  increases actually have dece lerated and inflation does not seem  to be a danger at present. The elves are clearly beginning to underm ine the confidence of their opponents, the Greenbo ok forecasters, [laughter] who are st arting to dou bt their own models, or at least are getting a little defensive abou t them , and perhaps even doubt their common sense. To be sure, the Greenbookers are too sophisticated to fall for the elves’ m ore brazen g immicks like the weather p loy, or th e bounceback from  the auto strik e, or perhaps even the extraordinarily low oil price.  They think those cannot be sustained, so they are boldly forecas ting a relativ ely quick s lowdown to trend and some acce leration in prices. But after pointing out for som e time that stocks were overvalued and that the stock m arket likely would com e down, th e Greenbookers are now saying that those stocks are even m ore overvalued than th e last tim e they looked. And although they expect p rofits to dec line f urther, th ey do not expe ct sto ck pric es to f all. They will on ly move sideways. What can be the explanation of  that? It’s on ly the fear th at the elves have been right so often that the Greenbooke rs would be em barrassed to be caught wrong again. Besides, nobody can predict the stock m arket. 2/2-3/99 62 The question now is: Have the elves run out of tricks or can they beat the gam e one m ore tim e? If it were not for the rest  of the world, I woul d bet on the elves. However, I am  not sure they speak P ortuguese. I am not sure they can m ove the Brazilian political system into higher gear  fast enough to reassure a nervous world international investors or cont rol the contagion that m ight fl ow from a collapse in Bra zil or from  some other m ajor negati ve event as yet unpredicted. So despite history, I am  left thinking that the Greenbook m ay actually win this time, though I m ust adm it that I also thought th at about the Atlanta Fa lcons. [Laughter] There is som e risk that the econom y may prove stronger in the early part of the year than the Greenbo ok forecast. I also hav e my doubts about whether the increase in the o il price will be as much as they think. On the other h and, the Greenb ookers m ay have overreacted to the elves on the stock m arket and could be understa ting th e chances of  a negativ e wealth effect. On the domestic fr ont, I see the risks of upside and downside surprises aro und the Greenbook forecast as approxim ately balanced. However, internationally, I see the risk as principally on the downside and possibly quite serious. As for the FOMC, I believe we should watch the gam e very carefully from our comfortable seats on the sidelines bu t resi st gettin g into th e action. Right now, any action, or even any indication of possible ac tion, is likely to do m ore harm than good.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Little h as changed in the Eleven th Distr ict since our last meeting, so I will b e very brief. As I said th en, th e growth rate in the E leventh District econom y slowed throughout 1998, and that has continued in recent weeks. With oil prices hovering in the $12 ra nge and not expected to pick up appreciably in the near future, consolidations and layoffs in the ener gy sector will likely cont inue for quite som e 2/2-3/99 63 time. Mexico, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of Texas exports to foreign countries, continues to weaken due to lower oi l prices and the higher interest rates they experienced in the weeks following Brazil’s cu rrency devaluation. This does not bode well for the Texas economy in the months ahead. On the other hand, our contacts in the semiconductor industry, which also has been a source of weakness recen tly, indicat e that there are s igns that d emand has bottom ed out and that sh ipments have begun to improve. We recen tly learned th at some of the workers who have been laid off in the sem iconductor and communications sectors have been rehired as contract workers. Other segm ents of the  econom y that continue to show strength are all the areas of construction. Labor m arkets rem ain exceptionally tight, and the only group that we hear has pricing power is com puter programm ers; everyone else says they have none. Offic e rents, which were rising very st eeply in the f irst half of last year, have been increasing much m ore slowly as new supplies have com e on the m arket. Other than in these two areas, there is little or no talk of inflationary pr essures in ou r District. Regarding the national econom y, I a m looking for 1999 to be pretty m uch a repeat of 1998. I expect the expansion to slow onl y slightly, due prim arily to labor force constraints, but for inflation to m aintain its downward tilt. Our contacts  in the oil indu stry are considerably m ore pessim istic than the Greenbook staff re garding oil prices over the next year or two. I guess outside of T exas tha t pessimism would tr ansla te as optim ism! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, in the Eighth District the sto ry is prim arily an echo of recent m onths. The Eighth District was not m uch affected by the credit m arket disturbances last fall and, th erefore, we have not been m uch affected by the weakening  of those disturbances. Rather than repeat the echo of what we have seen, I would just like to make one comment: It seem s to m e that more and m ore firms are learn ing to liv e successfully with what they had regarded as labor shortages. They still do not see the pricing power needed to raise prices and, therefore, they are learning to get along with what they previously regarded as a short-st aff situation. We just do not hear so m uch about that any m ore, although when we ask pe ople they tell us a bout all their unfilled position s. 2/2-3/99 64 On the national level, my contacts at UPS and Fe dEx say that they see steady growth in the United States. They see the situation in Europe as  solid. They see a bottom ing process in Asia and they see Latin  America as weak, though they do not have extensive business there. I would comm ent with regard to Bra zil that the market respon se to th e Bra zilian upset has seem ed to m e very sensible and m easured. The m arkets have made distinctions that m ake good sense; that is com pletely un like the response in A ugust to the problem s faced in Russia. I think the s ituation is entirely different. The staff forecast m akes good sense to m e. We could all quib ble with a tenth or two here or there. I think the staff has done a fine job of incorporat ing everything that is reasonab ly forecas table. What is going to get up and bite u s at som e point is som ething that we cannot foresee, but I am  not going to  criticize th e staf f for not f orecasting the unforecastab le. That’s all I am  going to say at this  point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The forecast rev isions in th e Greenbook are very sim ilar to m y own and in my view constitute som ewhat of a sea change in the econom ic outlook. It doesn’t seem to m e that most of you share that view, so let m e explain why I think that is so. Previously the Greenbook, the consensus forecast, and  my own forecast p rojected what I refer to as a rev erse soft lan ding. Growth slowed to below trend and the unem ploym ent rate gradually incr eased, unwinding som e of the excep tional tigh tness currently  prev ailing in labor m arkets and reducing the inflation risk posed by the above-trend growth  and the very tight labor markets. The revised forecast has the econom y slowing, but now  just toward trend. And the result is that the une mploym ent rate s tabilizes at a lowe r level than for any quarter in the previous Greenbook forecast. My first question is: Should such a sea ch ange in the outlook have a counterpart in monetary policy?  When I talk about pol icy here, I really am not referring to the targeted funds rate for th e interm eeting peri od th at we will talk about tomorrow. I am talking about policy in term s of the path of  the funds rate that we think would be consistent w ith our outlook over the next ye ar or two and whether or not that should change in light of the changed forecast. 2/2-3/99 65 Let m e just say a word about the inflation forecast. It does not seem  to have changed dram atically, but it has changed a bit. First of all, we have m ainly what I call a convergence story in 1999. That is, although co re CPI does not really change, we have an increase in both the o verall inflation rate and in GDP chain inflation as these m easures converge toward m ore norm al relationships to  the core rate, with overall inflation rising because of the dissip ation of the favorable supp ly shocks, particularly in th e energy area. But thereafter, with labo r markets very tight, the Greenbook and m y own forecast wo uld expect continued increases in inflation going fo rward. I think that is what we have to worry about. I pay a lo t of atten tion to the policy prescriptions from the Taylor rule. Som etimes the different rules that are in  the standard packet yield qu ite different im plications f or policy. Today, while they offer a variety of prescriptions for the current rate setting, there is one commonality. Whether one looks at the CPI or the chain GDP price version, at the v ersions with im posed or es timated coeffi cients or with the backw ard- or forw ard-looking specification, the prescription for the federal funds rate in the current quarter is higher than the prevailin g target. For exam ple, it ranges from 5.1 to 6.3 percen t for th e rules with imposed coefficients. So, I ask m yself: How have we ended up departing so aggressively from  the Taylor ru le prescription s? First, we hesita ted to tighten in the face of global ins tability following th e cris is in Korea and the n again f ollowing the tu rbulence af ter the devaluation and default by Russia. But neither  of those events to date has slowed the expansion. Second, our forecast gen erally ca lled for a slowin g to trend growth just around the corner, so we waited for the spont aneous slowdown rather than im posing a policy-induced slowdown. Of course, while  we waited for the slowdown, continued above-trend growth kept pushing the unem ploymen t rate low er until we ended up at a 4¼ percent unem ployment rate. And now we fi nd ourselves at that rate with one of the highest Greenbook growth forecasts in som e time and m any other forecasts also are pointing to relatively robust growth. Another reason we have  ended up there certainly is the possibility of a structural change suggested by the com bination of declining inflation along with a declining unem ploym ent rate. That provided a good reason for not slavishly following any historical regularity. 2/2-3/99 66 Let m e end with a suggestion on how we m ight want to think a bout the strategy of monetary policy going forward. We ought to follow and think a bout what I refer to as an increm ental asymm etric Taylor ru le. To star t off, I would con sider s etting the in itial specification of that Taylor rule by calculating what NAIRU would have to be to m ake the current setting of the funds rate the Taylor rule prescriptio n. The answer is that in the Taylor Rule with im posed coefficients, the NAI RU would have to be about 4½ percent. I think that is very m uch on the low side, but  som e might find it a plausible num ber. That is fine. It seem s to m e that going forward we  should at the very le ast follow the Taylor rule increm entally, raising the funds rate if continued above-tre nd growth was pushing the unem ploym ent rate even lower. That is, going forward we should be careful to begin again to lean  agains t a cy clical wind; ot herwise w e will con tinue to accom modate and indeed reinforce any and all positive dem and shocks. On the other hand, if the unem ployment ra te were to rise m odestly, given its already very low level, I w ould resist easing imm ediately. Hence the a symmetry in my approach. If inflation increases--and here I m ean incre ases in  the core CPI rath er than  a convergence of the overall rate to the core CP I--then I think we s hould respond as in the Taylor rule with m ore than proportionate in creases in the nom inal funds rate. On the other hand, if inflation d eclin es modestly fu rther,  I would passively accep t an increase in the real federal funds rate in light of the very low level of the prevailing unem ploym ent rate. That again is an asymm etric response.  So, I offer that as food for thought as we turn to d iscuss policy str ategy in m ore deta il tom orrow.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Second District’s econom y retained  strong mom entum  going into 1999, with price pressures largely in check. Private sect or job growth in New York a nd New Jersey accelerated to a 3.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. New York C ity registered its strongest annual job growth on record, 2.7 percent; the pr evious high had been 2.2 percent in 1969. Retailers report brisk post-hol iday sales in January, buoyed by a later-than-usual cold snap, a relaxation for eight shopping days of  the sales tax in N ew York City, and I suppose the view that since it got cold people needed winter coats after all. 2/2-3/99 67 Availability of  office spa ce in th e New Yo rk City area was tig ht but stable  in the fourth quarter. Vacancy  rates stopped falling an d rents rose at a less fren zied pace. Our District’s ho using m arket showed m ore signs of strength in Decem ber as indicated by rising hom e construction, brisk hom e sale s, and sturdy pric e appreciation. A benevolently warm , delightful December m ight have had som ething to do with that. Surveys of Purchasing Managers indicate continued weakness in the region’s manufacturing sector. Hotel occupancy rate s in Manhattan rem ained exceptionally high in Decem ber, with room  rates contin uing to r un about 10 percent ahead of  a year ago. In spite of all that, the CPI in the m etropolitan New York City area rose only 1.6 percent in 1998. That is the lowest since 1964, and I assum e that the mayor is extraordinarily unhappy that he cannot run for reelection. At the natio nal lev el, our forecas t for growth is v ery much like that of the Greenbook. The Greenbook suggests 2.6 percent in 1999 and we have it at 2.5 percent; we have growth at 2.3 percent in 2000 as compared with 2.4 per cent in the Greenbook. We are a little m ore concerned abou t--or at least our forecas t shows a hig her increas e in-­inflation. We have the C PI at 2.8 percent in 2000 com pared with the Greenbook’s 2.4 percent. The question of the balance of  risks is an interesting one at the m oment. If one were looking only at the dom estic econom y in the United St ates, there is no question in my m ind that the balance of risks would be on the upside. That is, the ec onom y is lik ely to grow faster than we anticipate. On the other hand, the risks on the international side would have a negative effect. But I think they are likely to be understandable m ore quickly than  has been th e case in the past. Japan is weak and could get w eaker because of the com bination of and terribly low consum er and business confidence. Continental Europe and the United Kingdom  are slowing down a bit, but probably not to a point where som e policy action co uldn’t turn those econom ies around. The interesting case, obviously, is Brazil. Brazil is a coun try th at I think is very, very different from  just about  every place else. It has im mense natural resources and a very diversif ied high quality popu lation. They  are given to consid erable swings of confidence and to periods of believing that the national lead er is capab le of great and wonderful things. For a quite understandable reason, they thought that  President Cardozo 2/2-3/99 68 would be able to continue to lead the ec onom y and to m ake good his comm itment to the exchange rate design, which was both the ec onom ic and perhaps m ore importantly the psychological base of the real plan. The law of gravity prevailed, or m arkets prevailed, and that was  no longer p ossible. The leadersh ip in the country had been s o comm itted to what they were doing that they did not ha ve contingency plans ready. That is not surprising; most people don’t ha ve contingency plans ready. Therefore, the Brazilians are still going through a period of trying to fi gure out what to do. However, just in the last couple o f days, it loo ks as if peop le are begin ning to find a m ore positive view of the situation. Now, that could reverse because  as one bum ps along a psychological trough it is difficult to know whe ther the next bounce will be down or up. The im portant thing is that between no w and our next m eeting, the Brazilians either are going to restore their sense of c onfidence in their leader ship and their country or they will not. If they do, the Brazilian shock probably wi ll be less great than we now think it is likely to be. On the other hand, if  they don’t regain their confidence, the shock will be a b it greater and the contag ion effect on Argentina a nd Mexico a  bit m ore severe. Therefore, at the p resent time watching a nd waiting clearly makes a great deal of sense for us. We do have to be careful not to fall into th e trap of thinking that we a re the central bank  of the world because w e are no t. With any luck,  we will hav e a much better opportunity at our nex t meeting to calculate m ore accurately what Brazil is lik ely to d o. Then we will be in a po sition to m ake a m ore accurate judgm ent about wh at policy path we should follow and how quickly we m ight need to adjust our current policy.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I felt the fourth-quarter growth statistics were sign ifican t news. They pushed the slowdown further into the future. There is still a slowdown in both the Greenbook and the Blue Chip forecast but it is smaller. The Greenbook now has only one quarter of growth below 2.5 percent. It seem s to be nearly a perfect sof t land ing in both forecasts without requiri ng po licy changes. The question is: Is that too good to be true? The slowdown in the Greenbook forecast h inges on three factors. I would  like to discuss each one briefly. The first is the internatio nal situation . I am  beginning to change m y view about th at becau se in a way we have taken the full shock. We are now 2/2-3/99 69 on the pessim istic outcom e track for Russia, Japan, and Brazil, along with having a modest slackening in Eu rope. The effects are no ticeab le, but as we saw in  the Chart Show earlier, they have done relatively little dam age to U.S. dem and growth. The U.S. econom y may not be an oasis of prosperity, but  at least it seem s to be a cluster of palm trees. [Laughter] On the stock  market, even the Green book seem s to have giv en up waiting  for the agree with that. My own reasoning is sim ilar to the point that Bob Parry’s question brought out earlier, which is that  the earnings/price ratios are not  out of line with falling real interest rates ov er the past few years. So I th ink the Greenbook forecast on sto ck prices is rou ghly accu rate, and that h as actu ally changed the s taff’s forecast som e. The third factor is som ething we have not talked about m uch here; it is the investm ent accelerato r. Investm ent is slow ing do wn from  the rapid pace of a few years ago, but it is still growin g more rapid ly than output in th e forecast. With the prev alence of infor mation technolo gy investm ent, it’s not clear to m e how m uch of a n accelerato r-induced slowdown we s hould expect in investm ent any m ore. In summ ary, m y view is that each of th ese neg ative factors th at could generate a slowdown is either partly digested, weakened, or in som e doubt. There are still grounds for expecting som e slowdown, but as far as I am concerned the balance of risks m ay be shifting. At the sam e time, I th ink it is too ear ly to change policy becau se I also see very few signs of price acceleration yet. There is  some in the Greenbook forecast, bu t that is partly due to special factors su ch as oil and partly due to an  estim ate of NAIRU that I am growing uneasy with, though I don’t want to wr ite down m y own num ber. There is not much acceleration of inflation in the Blue Chip forecas t. So, all things considered, it is difficult to p roclaim  that we see an acceleration y et. The second factor is produc tivity growth, which Dave St ockton illustrated in his charts earlier. That growth m ay be st epping up by a fairly noticeable am ount, which actually gives us m ore room  for vibrant dem and growth. The third f actor is the la gs in m onetary  policy, the subject that Governor Rivlin put on the table at our last meeting. Unlike the Atlanta Fed, I was not able to do any research on this in th e last month, so I accept what she said. I do believ e that m onetary 2/2-3/99 70 policy operates m ore quickly these days, and I think that does give us the luxury of waiting for evidence. We still have to be aler t. We have to move quickly. But we don’t have to m ove in advance of real evid ence of  acceleration in in flation which, as I said, is not available yet. All this adds up to m e as an argum ent fo r sitting tight. But as a result of the continued strong growth in the U.S. econom y, I do think the balance of risks is changing. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. As we start the new year, we are clearly faced with a different s ituation from the one we faced last y ear, and we probably will have so me difficult decis ions to m ake in the not-too -distant future. Last yea r, our forecast of slowing obviously was b eing driv en by extern al events; now we have a forecast that suggests s lowing w ill be driven to a large ex tent by internal f orces, nam ely private domestic final purchases.  It is obvious that just as  dom estic forces proved m uch stronger than the drag from  deteriorating ne t exports last year, so too the f orward mom entum  of the economy m ay prove to be  stronger than the forces for dom estic slowing featured in the current forecast. As the Greenbook notes,  the near term w ill probably reflect s ome unwinding of special factors that led to the upside surp rise in the fourth quarter, nam ely unusual weather and an auto strike re bound. Certainly there is som e truth to that. But the m ajor factor for the long-term  slowing, as I read the Greenbook, appears to be a forecast that the bull m arket has run its course and that the hou sehold wealth-to-incom e ratio will decline. I must adm it that to m e, as to oth ers, the stock m arket does seem  to be levitating above what one m ight think of as reasonable levels. But it is also true that we simply do not know enough about the f orces that drive the st ock m arket to put significant weight on a forecast that has a flat s tock m arket as a prom inent feature. Therefore,  it is really un clear to me that we are going to see the slowing that  we all seem  to have in our forecasts. The risks seem  to be m ainly to the upside. It is easy to determ ine what those risks are and what m ay drive econom ic growth above th e forecast: plentiful  jobs, accommodative credit conditions, and upbeat consum ers. 2/2-3/99 71 The extern al sector was a m ajor downside risk  last year. This year m uch of that has been res olved with the obvious excepti on of Brazil. Brazil is still a large and troubling question m ark, but the contagion t hus f ar has been contained and m arket reaction has been m uted. Most of the other issues that we were con cerned about last year seem  to have resolved them selves. They are reasonably well understood and probably have already had their strongest im pact on the U.S. econom y. Emerging Asia seem s to have bottom ed out. The most credib le forecast fo r Japan is th at while it w ill no t strengthen in the next severa l years, the deterio ration will be moderate f rom this tim e forward. Europe shows som e slight weakening, but there are reas ons to believe that monetary policy there can offset that. Ther efore, despite the u ncertainty created by the Brazilian situation, we have probably seen the w orst of the risks from  the external sector. While citing these forces for faster growt h, one must also admit th at there are few signs yet of em erging inflation. The econom y has achieved this benign price picture through a combination of special factors a nd possibly through increasing productivity growth. However, there are som e risks to th e inflation ou tlook. One is th at the specia l factors will unwind m ore quickly than we currently expect. Another is that labor m arket tightn ess will worsen at a faster  pace than businesses can offset. It is not only that the unem ployment rate is at a generation low, we also have fewer excess reserves, if you will, in the labor m arket. The num ber of  people o f working age who are n ot in th e lab or force but want a job has been decreasing at a fairly steady pa ce and is now at its lowest level since 1970, when that statistic first began to be tracked. Given the string of surprises we have ha d, including the strength of the fourth quarter, like m any others here I approach a forecast of slow ing with som e skepticism  and see the risks both internationally and perhaps ev en dom estically as shaded  slightly to the upside com pared to the b aseline forecast. I think the appropriate response  for us is to re ly less on a future as predicted by m odels and m ore on inferences, both quantitative and qualitative, that com e in with the late st data. Obviously, for those of us who take this approach th ere are som e challenges. By nece ssity we are likely to have a shorter tim e frame for action. However, the corollary is that once the evidence is m ore clearly in hand, we should not hesitate to m ove decisive ly if the data so warrant. We are not precluded from  acting preem ptively if new infor mation were to tip the ba lance of  risks to 2/2-3/99 72 the outlook much m ore decisively to ward an unacceptab le probability of higher inflation. Such a probability, if it were to em erge, woul d in m y judgment warrant a policy response. We are not there yet in my view, but we m ay be soon. We must be careful not to misinterpret the signals that we receive.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Thank you. Mr. Chairm an, I would not have thought it possible, but som ehow the Comm ittee’s polic y dilemm a continue s to deepen ra ther than to sho w signs of beginning to resolve itself. The econom y continues to surge ahead. We all, or at least most of us, believe that it should  and will s low. But we have had goo d reason to believ e that for som e time and yet the pace, if any thing, has accelerated an d there are f ew signs of slo wing so far. If the pace of growth  begins to s low as we expect, we likely will have to address the possible need for furthe r easing at som e point. If, however, the present p ace or som ething close to it should c ontinue, we soon will alm ost surely need  to consider at what point policy will have to le an in to tha t stren gth in th e interest of sustainability. I say this realizing fully th e difficulty that such a policy m ove could present internationally. But even if one adopt ed the m ost optim istic reasonable scenario of the strength and durability of the current vi rtuous cycle--an d I am  pretty m uch in th at camp--it is still necessary to realize that it has lim its beyond which unsatisfactory conditions b egin to gain mom entum . At th e pace the econom y has been g rowing, we are very likely getting close to those lim its. In the Hum phrey-Hawkins forecast m ade at  this tim e last year for 1998, we were well off the m ark. Everything turned out to be much better than we expected. Growth was stronger, unem ploym ent lower, yet infla tion quiescent. The out come was literally wonderful. Can we reasonably expect a repeat ? I doubt it. At the m oment, working with the ava ilable data, th e risks appear to be d ecidedly on the upside. But I can envision the possibility, perhaps the likelihood, that this could be reversed  very quickly for any of a combination of reasons arising from  the dom estic or international, real or f inancial econom y. I continue to be uncertain as to which di rection our next m ove m ay be or when we should tak e it. But m y sense is th at the upside risk s will hav e to begin to d issipate soon or they are going to need to be addressed. 2/2-3/99 73

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Comm ittee m ust decide wh ether to adopt the provisional money and debt ranges it chose last July or to m odify them . In the Bluebook, we did not present alternat ives to the provisional ranges because of the Comm ittee’s previou s skepticism  about the reliab ility of the relationship between these aggregat es and econom ic perfor mance and hence their usefulness as guides to policy. Inste ad, the Comm ittee has f or some time chosen ranges for m oney th at it viewed to be benchm arks under conditions of price stability and of ve locity behavior that conf orms to typical historical experience. The Committee has not found that this practice ha s impeded its ability to ex tract and use inform ation from  the monetary aggregates as an input to its decisionm aking. In the case of debt, the Comm ittee has chosen ranges based on expected growth--not the price stability benchm ark--but the inconsistency between the m oney and debt ranges has not been a problem . Today, I would like to review the staff’s projections and to discu ss recen t experien ce with m oney as an econom ic indicator. Your first exhibit presents th e provisional ranges and the staff’s projections of m oney and debt gr owth for 1999 consistent with the Greenbook econom ic forecast. 3/ Also shown are actual outcom es in 1998. The staff foresees growth in both  M2 and M3 slowing this year, but remaining ra pid with r espect to their provisional price st ability ranges and with respe ct to growth in  nom inal GDP . Debt of dom estic nonfinancial sectors also is projected to dece lerate this ye ar bu t to f inish th e year around the 5 percent m idpoint of its provisional range. We believe that the behavior of money m arket mutual funds is an important elem ent in understand ing recen t and p rojected declines in monetary velocity. As shown in th e lower panel of the exhibit, m oney funds in both M2 and M3 have grown at double-digit rates in  recen t years, and both typ es of funds registered a pronounced acceleration last year. Of course, if growth in these com ponent s cam e solely at the expense of the other com ponents in M2 and M3, their strength w ould not have implications for overall growth in m oney. However, we are of the view 3/ A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Sim pson is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 3) 2/2-3/99 75 that m uch of the expansion in m oney funds in recent years ref lects other influences that have had the effect of boosting growth in M2 and M3. At the M2 level, we think that m oney funds m ay have been benefiting from  efforts by households to diversif y portfolios swollen by the surge in equity va lues. Illustrative of this process is  the top panel of your next exhibit show ing shares of mutual fund assets. Even with the hefty double-digit increases in m oney funds, the money fund share of total mutual fund assets h ad been drifting dow n until the m iddle of last y ear. It turned up in the th ird qua rter am id the m arket turmoil and heightened demand for liquid and less risky assets and then tu rned back d own in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, in an environm ent of essentially stagnant equity p rices, as assum ed in the s taff forecast, g rowth of total assets will diminish. But investors are expected to view m oney fund returns as m ore attractive in rela tive term s than th ey have in the recent past and to seek to rebuild somewhat the m oney fund portfo lio share. In short, we foresee money funds continuing to grow fair ly rapidly, lifting M2 growth again this year. As a consequence, M2 velocity sh ould decline further this y ear even though stab le short-term  interest rate s imply little change in op portunity costs, as shown in the bottom  panel of the chart. The 2 percent expected drop in velo city and the staff’s for ecast of 4 perc ent growth in nom inal GDP i mply the 6 percen t forecast for M2 in 1999. Turning to M3 and Exhibit 3, m oney m arket mutual funds are believed to have contributed to growth in this aggr egate beyond their impact on M2. In particular, those funds in M3 only, so-called institution-only funds, have becom e an ever-popular cash m anagem ent instrum ent, substituting on business balance sheets for direct holdings of money m arket asse ts ou tside M3, suc h as Treasu ry bills, as well a s othe r balances in M3. Firm s can outsource this function to m oney funds and thereby dispense with in-house tim e and effort required for the frequent placing of liquid balances in the m arket. We believe that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future, boosting M3; however, with no further favoring m oney funds reem erging, money funds in M3 only should Another factor that boosted M3  growth last year was a surge in bank credit and associated funding need s, shown in the bar chart in the middle of Exhibit 3. This was cause d in part by the disruptions to financial m arkets beg inning la te in th e summ er that led som e businesses to tap bank lines instead of m arket sources and banks to hold rather than securitize loans and to acquire secur ities having unusually large spreads. In the less tu rbulen t market se tting a nticipated fo r the cu rrent year, we are 2/2-3/99 76 forecasting that growth in bank cred it will s low some, contrib uting to a slowing in growth in overall deposit ory credit, the bottom  panel. As a result, growth in depository credit should move c loser to that of total debt of dom estic nonfinancial sectors. W ith the distribution of funding between M3 and other sources sim ilar to last y ear, we are led to a still consider able 8 percent expansion in M3 this ye ar, im plying more than a 3½ percent drop in its velocity, which is sm aller than in 1998. The anticipated slowing of debt grow th this year shown in the chart-­to 5¼ percent--is accounted for both by a larger run-off of federal debt, owing to a $100 billion projected fisc al surplus, and to som e moderation in business and household borrowing. Nonetheless, growth in total debt again exceeds that of nom inal GDP by about the sam e margin as in 1998, as spending rem ains tilted toward cr edit-intensive consum er and producer durable goods and housing and as de bt-financed m erger activity stays brisk. Last year, both m oney a nd incom e growth exceeded staff expectations, resurfacing the question of whether the m onetary aggregates As I noted earlier, som e of the unusually strong growth in M2 and M3 last year reflected not only incom e growt h but also outsized declines in their velocities, much of which had not been anticipa ted. Still, the surprises in money and incom e were large and corre lated, however loosely. Certainly, the rapid m oney growth in the fall was suggesting that the banking system was able to interm ediate credit witho ut ser ious str ains. To exam ine the question of whether the m onetary and debt aggregates evidence on Exhibit 4--evide nce that should be regard ed as illustrative and not definitive of indicator  properties. Each panel contain s the coefficients and t-statistics for sixteen-quarter rolling regressions that relate growth in nominal GDP on a quarterly basis to  growth in money or debt on a contem poraneous and o ne-quar ter-lagged basis.  Large, and positiv e, values for th e coefficients and t-s tatistics im ply value of  the aggregate as an indicator of quarterly growth in nominal GDP growth. As shown in the top panel f or M2, the last tim e the t-s tatistics appr oached the important level of 2 was in th e mid-1980s. In recent years,  coefficients have been very sm all and statistica lly insign ificant at standard levels, suggesting by this m etric that M2 has had little va lue as an indicator of nominal GDP. Moreover, the story doesn’t change much for M3 and debt, shown in the m iddle and bottom  panels, respectivel y. It is worth noting that these are quite s imple statistical exercises  and there may be tim es when surprises in the m onetary aggregates, allowing for special factors that m ay be affecting velocity, are giving off clearer s ignals that the econom y is 2/2-3/99 77 departing from  expectations, especi ally when tho se surprises are corroborated by other indicators. Thus, at this point we are hard pressed to suggest that you treat the broad monetary or debt aggregates any differently as indicators than you have in recent years. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions for Tom ? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. In Exhibit 4, what does a negative t-s tatistic m ean? Does that mean that there’s a negative sign ? 

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON. The coefficient has  turned neg ative. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Tom, is there any evidence to suggest that the big surge in velocity that occurred, contrary to expectations, from opportunity costs in the early 1990s m ay be in the pr ocess of reversing itself? 

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON. That’s a possibility, but it is r ather hard to co me up with the econom ic intuition as to why that m ight be happening. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Any more so th an was the ca se with re spect to the econom ic intuition in 1990?  What happened subsequent to 1990 was far more of a surprise than a reversal would be  today, if I m ay put it that w ay. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think that by 1991 we were beginning to get som e sense of what was going on--specifically, that banks were getting into the mutual fund business. Mutual funds in particular were m uch more freely available to households, and households were diversifying their portfolios ou t of deposits. That was encouraged at the time by a steeply upward sloping yield curve whic h, to be sure, is reversing. So there were a lo t of purchases -­

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We knew a bout that but we didn’t forecast a change in the gap between opportunity costs and M2 velocity as a consequence, as I recall. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. If you look back at ou r forecasting  in 1990 and  1991, that developm ent caught us som ewhat by surprise . But toward the end of 1991 and in 1992 we were doing a better job of forecasting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. You we re putting in add factors. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Yes, because we knew that  the w orld had changed, so the old equations weren’t working. Exactly. 2/2-3/99 78 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. I must say that I have not changed m y vie w that inflation is fundam entally a m onetary phenom enon. But I am becom ing far m ore skeptical that we can define a proxy that actu ally captures what m oney is, either in term s of transaction balances or those elem ents in the econom ic decisionm aking process which represent m oney. We are strugg ling here. I think we have to  be careful not to assum e by definition that M1, M2, or M3  or anything is m oney. They are all proxies for the underlying conceptual variable that we all em ploy in our generic evaluation of the im pact of money on the econom y. Now, what this sugge sts to m e is that m oney is hiding itself very well. Don, do you think we ought to discuss the Hum phrey-Hawkins issue before we go into th is or a fter? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. It’s up to you. You need to do two things here. One is to decide whether to readopt the ranges you had on a prov isional basis. If people have views on that, m aybe while they are giving thos e views they can also comm ent on-­

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let me suggest the following: If we are all of the same view as we were the last tim e--to stay  essentially with the noninflationary or price stability ranges for M2 and M3--m aybe we can  get that out of  the way and then discuss what to do with debt. If it turns out after we  go around the table that we have significant differences of view, it may be desirable to di scuss both issues together. That way we can have a single conversation covering not only what we want to do today but what, if anything, w e want to recommend to the Congress with regard to potential revisions in our reporting requirem ents under the H umphrey-Hawkins Act. So, I would appreciate getting a quick sense from everybody as to wh ether they would like to stay with the prelim inary M2 and M3 targe ts. We will l earn ve ry quick ly whether o r not to go on to the next discussion. The sim plest way to do that is to start with you, Governor Rivlin. 

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN. I would stay with the prel iminary ranges because I don’t feel that I have any basis for a new  set of targets. [Secretary’s note: In the subsequent go-around, all Board m embers and Reserve Ban k Presiden ts indica ted th at they  concurred with Ms. Rivlin’s sta tement.] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. On the debt ra nge, we have a little inconsistency. What would be your recomm enda tion on what to use for debt? 2/2-3/99 79 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think you’ve done very well with what you have been doing. No one has really noticed this inconsistency. [Laughter] Seven months ago I gave up on this! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. What specifi cally are we using for debt? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. The prelim inary range was 3 to  7 percent, and the projection is that growth in de bt will b e right in th e middle of  that range. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Does anybody di sagree with adding the debt range to the vote on the M2 and M3 ranges? Hearing no objections, I suggest we vote on the three of them. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD. Do you want m e to read the d irective lang uage ? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Yes, please. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD. The l anguage is shown in the Bluebook on page 23 under the heading “1999 ranges”: “The Federal Op en Mark et Comm ittee seeks m onetary and financial co nditions tha t will f oster price stability and prom ote susta inable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Co mmittee at this m eeting estab lished ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from  the fourth quarter of 1998 to the f ourth quarter of 1999. The range for growth of total dom estic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of  the m onetary aggrega tes will con tinue to be eva luated in the light of  progr ess toward price level stability, m ovements in their velocitie s, and developments in the econom y and financial m arkets.”

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Let me take a minute to explain this issue of the Hum phrey-Hawkins reauthorization. Unbeknownst to 104 percent of the world, [laughter] a piece of leg islation went through th e Congress a few years ag o which effectively sunset virtually every report requ ired to be issued by various governm ental agencies. One reason it happened th at way wa s because the legis lation s aid that all reports listed in som e obscure source would be “included under this Act,” and that list included absolutely everything. Nobody here caught it except Don Winn, who does that sort of thing for a living. It cam e as a gr eat puzzlem ent to everybody. So it turns out that under law the reporting requirem ents in the Hu mphrey-Hawkins Act--not the Act itself but the reporting asp ect o f it, I ga ther, Don--will expire at year-end. 

[SECTION]

MR. W INN. It is the repo rting requirem ent that expires, not the goals of the Federal Reserve Act. This doesn’t have anything to do with the goals of m aximum employm ent, price stability-­

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I underst and. Do you know offhand if our testim ony is included in the reporting requi rements? How is that stipulated? 

[SECTION]

MR. W INN. The way the Federal Reserve Act reads, we are supposed to subm it this report on a sem i-annual basis and then we are to consult w ith the Congress on the report. The “consulting with  the Congress” has m eant th e testim ony. If there is no report, it is hard to see how there is  any obligation to testify on anything. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. So, e ffectiv ely, on e can read th e sunsetting as applying to both the report and the testim ony? 

[SECTION]

MR. W INN. That is m y understanding. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Clearly, when that inform ation rolled its way onto somebody’s agenda, it created a few sparks. The general presum ption was that there would be som e autom atic rollover or reauth orization of the Hum phrey-Hawkins reporting requirem ents and that would be that. Someone asked the newly ensconced Chairm an of the Senate Banking Comm ittee, Phil Gramm, whet her in fact that w ould be the case and when he was going to p ut reau thorization on the Comm ittee’ s agenda. He said that it wasn’t clear to him  that such legislation wa s needed, and that response opened up a host of repercuss ions. Within hours, Chairm an Leach of the House Banking Comm ittee indicated that he was adam antly opposed to any change. We are now in the position 2/2-3/99 81 where, as best I can judg e, Phil Gram m isn’t saying he is going to fight this to the death but just that he thinks we ought to discuss it. It is clear, how ever, that it’s an issue about which he doesn’t feel all that strongly. But there is a secondary issu e here, which is not irreleva nt to the consideration of this reauthorization. And that is that we do have an opportunity, if we so choose, to offer recomm endations on changes in the nature of what we report and how  we report it. So, rather than just having an extension of the existing legislation with no alteration, it is quite conceivable that recommendations fr om the Federal Op en Marke t Comm ittee would have som e influe nce on the C ongress in  term s of how t he reauthorization would go forward. Since this is not anything urgent, there is no need to com e to any conclusions today. But if you have som e suggestions that  you would like to raise today, that would be useful. And if you have a suggestion at a later tim e, communicat e with Don Kohn. In the process, when the tim e for the actua l reauthorization ro lls around and we are requested to give our v iews--indeed, it is conce ivable th at I w ill be asked at the Hum phrey-Hawkins hearings on February 23--

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN. I think it is incon ceivable th at yo u will not b e asked. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I guess that’s right. So, it would be helpful to hear from  you on any change that you think m ight be useful. Obviously, the sooner you bring it up, the better, but it need not be today. Having said that, if anyone has any thoughts at the m oment triggered by the m emo that was se nt to you earlier, it m ight be useful to get them  on the table so tha t we can get a  sens e of the Comm ittee’ s tentativ e views on this. Presiden t Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. I’d just like to comm ent on the broad issue rather than make specific sug gestions for change. One of the cr iticism s traditionally leveled at th e cen tral bank is th at we are a pec uliar institution in a dem ocracy in th at we are no t accoun table and som ehow are out there on our own. While the Hum phrey-Hawkins reporting has not eliminated that cr iticism , it does s eem to m e that it goes a long way toward saying that indeed we are accountable. It gives us an opportunity to explain what we are doing and to consult with the Congress. So, I think Hu mphrey-Hawkins has turned out to be very 2/2-3/99 82 useful, not o nly for us as  a central bank but also because it probably has enhanced understanding to som e extent on Capitol Hill. In term s of the broad issue, I think we  ought to com e down foursquare in support of a continuation of the basic nature of the Hum phrey-Hawkins report and the testim ony. That said, th ere prob ably are som e modificati ons that m ight be put on the table that could improve it or bring it m ore into  line with som e of the things we actually do. I’d like to give som e further thought to what those m odific ations m ight be specifically. But on the broad question of its reauthorization, I think we ought to be for continuing it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Yes, I think th e few people I have talked to on this subject would fully agree with you on that. If anything, we ought to over-emphasize that particular point because that is the crucial part of the Hum phrey-Hawkins Act, even if there are e lements within it, which I suspect there are, that are ju st fillers and do not repres ent an y useful communicatio n from  the Federal Open Market Com mittee to the Congress. Those elem ents really ought to be elim inated; they are a waste of tim e for a lot of people here in W ashington and throughout th e Federal Reserve. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I am totally in agreem ent with what Ed Boehne has said. I think there is a real downside risk if we do not  report on a frequent basis to the Congress. We do have our autonom y to be concerned abou t. If we are not accoun table, that can b e taken away. We have to dem onstrate that we  think about the right things and that our action s are well m otivated. And the Hum phrey -Hawkins report is one way of doing that. I have one question, though. I’m not all that familiar and I don’t know whether my staff is all th at fam iliar w ith this “filler”--to u se your la nguage--that is  required by the Hum phrey-Hawkins Act. That m ight not be all that obvious to us. Is it just the estimates on GNP, inflation, and unem ploym ent that we pr epare or are there a lot of  other things the staff has to put in the report? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Brian Madigan has copies of  Section 2A of the Federal Reserve Act, which covers that. Why don’t you pass them out, Brian. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think a lot of  it relates to our interpretation, as distinct from what is  statutorily required. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Right. Obviously, the monetary  aggregates ran ges are in th ere, but so is the req uirem ent to take accoun t of past and prospective developm ents in 2/2-3/99 83 employm ent, unem ploym ent, production, i nvestm ent, real incom e, productivity, international trade, payments, and prices. And th ere is the po int about discussing the relationsh ip of all tha t with the goa ls in the Pr esident’s Econo mic Report. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. So we have to weigh that  Report, which we get after it is given to Congress. And as far as the staff is concer ned, alm ost all of that  is required as opposed to things we have added? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. To a considerable extent we  feel they are required. The Act has been am ended over th e years to include  additional em phasis on international developm ents. In response to that, we have beefed up the in terna tiona l section s. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Obviously, our treatm ent of a lot of things in cluded in that list probably could be m odified in som e way or another. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. That is the ty pe of recomm endation that w ould be helpf ul for me to get. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I figu red that m ight be what you had in m ind. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. I have m y own ideas, but it w ould be very helpful to me to get a good sense of the Comm ittee’s thoughts, as dis tinct from  my own, on any specific issue. I might be unaware of str ong support for including certain things that I thought people m ight not want to include. So I would like to get a sense of the Comm ittee’s views. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I can’t comm ent on all the details, but there is one thing I’m sure we ought to do. We ought to convey the view that while there m ay be real inform ation in the m onetary aggregates c onceptually, we believ e the sp ecific ranges suggest a precision about our knowledge of the relationship of  those ranges to econom ic perform ance in the upcom ing years that is somewhat lacking. We have told Congress that. I think som e of the detailed inf ormation we are required to produce on that m ay not be serving us well and m ay not be conveying anything about what we really think is going on. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. I don’t have a lot of detailed suggestions, Mr. Chairm an. More generally, a key point to m e about th e Humphrey-Hawkins reports, which we do twice a year,  is that they are very useful  both inte rnally and e xterna lly from the 2/2-3/99 84 standpoint of developing a strategy. Naturally, at our FOMC m eetings we are focused on current developm ents and the imm ediate policy issues; this sem i-annual reporting requirem ent gives us a chance to stand back and think a bit more strategically. I think that he lps us  internally a nd it he lps u s in term s of communicating to  the public by giving them  a background against which to interpret our short-term  actions and statem ents. I think that is a key value of  this reporting requirem ent. In term s of the changes, I agree with what has been sa id abou t the ranges f or the monetary aggregates. It seem s to m e that, in terms of comm unicating our strategy, we need to supplem ent those num bers with som ething. As I have said in these m eetings a number of tim es be fore, my own feeling is th at som ething like inflation targets would be a particularly prom ising direction in which to move. W e now have som e experience with other central banks doing this. I would hope, now  that the issue of the report is going to come up in any event, that one of the things  we m ight consider seriously is adopting an inflation target of som e sort. I would suggest one other change. One of the key parts in the report is the summary of the individual projections we pr ovide, which are encapsulated in the central tendency projections in the repo rt. To clarify those, it woul d be helpful if we all m ade them  contingent on a uniform  assumption of no change in policy. That w ould in a sense put us all on the sam e page and elim inate a ny am biguity or confusion or lack of clarity that m ight result from  the fact that different m embers of the Comm ittee may be using different policy assum ptions in generating their own individu al forecas ts. It seem s to m e one of the advantages of  that would be th at it wo uld help to signal the undesirable consequences of not taking policy actions in one direction or the other that we need to take. It might put us in a position to be more proactive in presenting our policy stance and perhaps less defensive in public discussions of monetary policy. I believe that is the procedure the Bank of England uses in its cu rrent reporting approach. That is another suggestion I think we ought to look at. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I agree with m uch of what ha s been said. Just to add to a point that Cathy Minehan was m aking: This does seem  to present us, as a Committee, with an opportunity to discuss in the te stimony what we think the role of the aggregates should 2/2-3/99 85 be. We have spent a great deal of tim e over the years talking about th is issue, and w e end up giving the targets m ore prom inence than m ost of us think is warranted. This m ay be an opportunity to adopt a procedure that would more closely reflect wh at we in fact do and what we believe in term s of the weight th ese statistics versus others should be given. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH . Mr. Chairm an, it seems to m e that everybody here is in agreem ent that the Hum phrey-Hawkins testim ony is a great opportunity and should be continued. I have a little difficulty, just procedurally, hearing people say they like this , that, o r the other thing b ecause that results in a d isorderly debate. People m ake suggestions, som e of whic h I think are grand and som e of which I think are quite bad. If people gave their ideas to Don Kohn, as you suggested, then at the next m eeting we could have an orderly discu ssion of the ideas that have been offered rather than have som ebody announce an idea and others by their silence give the impression that they agree with it. In som e cases I agree and in som e cases I don’t. But we could spend the rest of the week here if we debated every idea brought forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The difficulty is that the February 23 testimony is before our next m eeting. One possibility is for D on Kohn to send around a questionnaire and list the various suggestions  that would involve changes to the statute. Changes on things not mandated by statute we  can m ake any tim e we want. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. I was of  the im pression that at the testim ony on February 23 you would be as ked what you thought and you would give a generic ans wer that the testim ony is appr opriate and that we will be think ing of suggestions on the content of the reauthorizing legislation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Yes, I could do th at. In fact, that is what I would plan to do. What do you think, Don? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think this coul d be a two-stage process. That is, you could m ake it very clear on February 23 that the F OMC strongly supports the continuation of a reporting regim e of some sort em bedded in law. And you could sa y that we would be more than happy to work with the C ongre ss over tim e on designing a reporting regim e that m eets their needs and that we think is reasonable. So, I don’t know that we need to reach a conclusion before February 2 3 about wh at we want in  the leg islation except th at 2/2-3/99 86 we want the regim e to continue and that we will be m ore than happy to work with Congress on how that process will go. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. That strikes m e as a quite reasonable approach. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Why don’t we leave it there, then? 

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN. May I raise a technical point as a word of caution?  If we start to indicate what we would like future H umphrey-Hawkins reports to include, in term s of what we would want spe cified in the law, we w ill not get the last word. They will. Every member of the Banking Comm ittee is going to have an idea about what  ought to be in the law, and the easies t thing for the Chairm an of that comm ittee to do is to pu t them  all in.  I think we should not encourage a rewriting of  the law, even though I personally would like to get rid of the m onetary  ranges,  because once we start do wn that road  we m ight end up a lot worse off than we are now. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That is indeed a thoughtful comment. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. That’s a good point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The more I thin k about it, the m ore it strikes m e as being subtly obvious. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Yes, I agree. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. We m ay actually be better off with the sam e legislation. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. We can m ake som e changes without changing the Act. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. We can m ake a lot of changes ourselves because the statute itself  is not all the exp licit. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. I think Alice has sp oken wisely; I think she’s right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You earned you r pay today! President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . I think Alice’s caution is very well stated. In looking at this though--and this is really the first tim e I have  looked at it carefully--I assum e this is the entire reporting requirem ent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. That is the Act. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . The se ction is entitled “M onetary and Credit Aggregates.” All the reporting is under m onetary and credit aggregates, which is rather ironic given the 2/2-3/99 87 discussion we just had about the lim itations of the aggregates them selves. I recognize that there is som e risk in trying to co me up with changes to this, but it really is misleading to the Am erican people to have  the reporting requirem ents in a section entitled “Monetary and Credit Aggregates.” I would hope that we could do som ething bette r than that in term s of how we a re going to comm unicate. 

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN. If none of us has read it, you can rest assured very few other people have. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I’m not sure whether that t itle is som ething we put on the docum ent or--

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I will b egin my brief ing today with a  discuss ion of  the sim ulations presented in the Bluebook, and I will be referencing the charts in the Bluebook in the process. These exerci ses were designed to shed light on the econom ic and policy environm ent em bedded in the staff’s Greenbook forecast, and  they m ay have im plications for the Comm ittee’s policy strategy. The baseline scenario, shown on Cha rt 3 following page 8, extends the Greenbo ok forecast. It was des igned to be co nsisten t with  the 2/2-3/99 88 underlying logic and econom ic trends of  that forecast, and hence preview what could be in store after 2000. The staff’s assessm ent is that the econom y is now in diseq uilibrium  in th at the unemploym ent rate is below its sus tainable lev el; moreover cond itions are no t in plac e to c orrec t this situation. Real interest rates are low er than their natural levels and fall further over the next two years as the no minal interest ra te is held cons tant while inflation and, by assum ption, infla tion expectations rise. Decreasing real rates do not produce an even gr eater intensification of inf lation pressures because som e of the econom ic strength of 1998 is seen as trans itory an d because th e equilibriu m real rate is falling. Over the long run, the wealth-to-income ratio declines  as the stock m arket levels out, governm ent debt is paid down, and fo reign indebtedness grows, raising household saving and depressing the natural interest rate. This disequilibrium  implies that pol icy m ust firm  at som e point and that the econ omy must experien ce su bpar econo mic growth to lim it inflation. In the baseline, the policy response was assum ed to be delayed and the Comm ittee satisfied with capping inflation at 2¾ percent. To hold inflation down by m ore, as in the price stab ility s cenario, the Comm ittee must begin to tighten so oner and be w illing to co ntinue to f irm policy ev en as the unem ploym ent rate rises. The disequilibrium  in the baseline arises from  a judgm ent that the surprisingly favorable in flation perform ance of recent years h as been th e product in part of transitory factors de pressing prices and labor costs. The lower NAIRU scenario in the second set of sim ulations, show n on Chart 4 after page 9, considers the conseque nces if instead the disinflation is assum ed to have been a result of last ing changes in the structure of labor and product m arkets. If the NAIRU i s as low as 4½ percent, the econom y is not in d isequilib rium  at presen t and  nom inal an d real inte rest rates are close to sustainable levels. Under these conditions, keeping the federal funds rate at 4¾ percen t over the n ext several years will b e associated with a slight uptick in inflation as oil a nd import prices turn around, but only to a steady state rate of 2 percent. As it happens, a 4½ percent NAIRU al so would h elp to recon cile the curren t stance of m onetary  policy with th e resu lts of Taylor-type rules. Governor Gram lich noted at the la st meeting and Governor Meyer yesterd ay that the v ersions of  this rule the s taff calcula tes all tend to show that the federal funds rate is too lo w. This undershoot results from  the existence of a large gap of actua l over potential out put, by standard calcu lations.  If the NAIRU is at th e lower 4½ pe rcent le vel, however, the gap about disappears, and the current f unds rate is m ore nearly consistent with the Co mmittee’s p ast pattern o f reaction s to actual and forecasted levels of output and inflation and with  Taylor’s rule. Of course, it is possible to look at the results from  both types of experim ents from  another 2/2-3/99 89 perspective: For the current level of the funds rate not to be too accomm odative over tim e, structural ch anges in labor and pro duct m arkets must be very substantial and persistent. The surprise s over re cent years hav e been in agg regate dem and as well as agg regate supp ly, and the s imulations shown on Chart 5 after page 10 look at the im plications of situ ations in which aggregate dem and deviates from the baseline. We chos e alternativ e paths for the dem and for producers ’ durable equip ment because that h as been an im portant source of unanticip ated s trength in aggreg ate dem and in recen t years and feeds back on supply as well. Greater  capital spending does raise the productivity of labor and the level of  potential output over time, but its more significant effect in the short run is on dem and. Thus , policy m ust be appreciably firm er if dem and sur prises on the upside, even if it is productivity-enhancing spending that constitutes the surprise. The simulation f ollows the T aylor ru le to tighter policy; perhaps the m ore general point is that with labor m arkets already stretched, policy needs to respond promptly to unexpected ove rshoots in dem and to hold down the rise in inflation. Against this background, the decision  at this m eeting would seem  to rest in part on whether the Comm ittee agrees with the basic m essage in the staff forecast that exis ting and prospective p ressures on resou rces and th e likely recovery in oil and im port prices  point toward higher inflation. If the Comm ittee views the risks as stro ngly skewed in this direction, it might want to consider a firm ing of po licy, if not at this m eeting, then in the near future--as m ight be indicated by a tilt tow ard firm ing in the directive. Growth has yet to slow from  an unsustainable pace, and labor resource utilization is higher than ex pected when you eased in Nove mber. From  a somewhat longer perspectiv e, over the past year both the unem ployment rate and the federal funds rate have been reduced significantly. Other things  equal, policy interest rates and unemploym ent rates ought to m ove in opposite direc tions, since the lower unem ploym ent rate g enerally raise s inflation r isks. Of course other things haven’t been equal. For one thing, inflation and, to a lesser extent, inflation expectations  were falling  in 1998, raising real sho rt-term  rates . But a good portion of the decline in nom inal sh ort-term rates  since last su mmer probably has fed into real rates, offset ting m uch of the previous increase. In addition, inflation expectations m ay be less likely to fall going forward to produce such a passive tighteni ng with the nom inal funds rate unchanged. Even if the staff has given too little weight to the possibility that the econ omy is m uch less " inflation prone," transitory factors surely have played som e role in holding down  prices. Absent additional serious problem s abroad that red uce comm odity  prices and put upward pressure 2/2-3/99 90 on the dollar , those f actors will abat e, giving und erlying cost pressur es more of a chance to show through to prices and price expectations over time. Another thing that wasn’t equal la st year was th e financial m arket disruptions that led to a tightening of credit conditions for a tim e. However, the expansion of econo mic activity has been supported by reasonably well functioning financial m arkets of late. Growth of m oney has been strong, and credit has been read ily available in m arkets as well as at banks. While risk spreads rem ain high in som e sectors of the m arkets, they have stabilized for the m ost par t; despite higher spreads, the cost of credit for many borrowers has declin ed on balance since last summ er, owing in part to Federal Reserve easi ngs. And increases in equity prices have boosted wealth and reduced the cost of equity capital. Improved conditions in credit m arkets have been  signaled by their resilience to year-end pressu res and to th e difficultie s of Brazil. Indeed, to th e extent you r easing last Nove mber was undertaken to  protect against the possibility of major financial d isruptions from these particular events, that protection might see m to be less needed now. Despite the ongoing risks of great er price pressures, however, inflation has rem ained very well behaved. Moreover, threats persist to U.S. econom ic perfor mance from  developm ents abroad. In these circum stances, the Comm ittee m ay be inclined to leave policy unchanged today, and also to consider the odds on tightening in the near future rem ote enough to justify reta ining a symm etrical directive. The benign inflation new s, especially when coupled with a lack of acceleration in nom inal com pensation , might sugg est th at the potential for higher inflation has not yet been dem onstrated. Uncertainties about the supply side of the economy m ake preem ptive policym aking especially difficult. Although the Comm ittee m ay not wa nt to await the "sm oking gun" of a string of higher inflation num bers before it firm s, it m ight want more indicators that current levels of  pressures o n resources were raising costs than it now has. And in this  price environment, it m ay have the scope to wait for confirmation that growth rem ains above potential before leaning against tigh tening labor m arkets. Moreover, our econom ic perform ance may be viewed as still subject to downside risks from  developm ents overseas. A highly unsettled Brazilian situation has the continuing potential for financial contagion to other coun tries beyond that assum ed in the staff forecast. And industrial econom ies aside from  the United States appear to be weakening. In Japan and Europe, the risks to growth pros pects m ay be tilted to the downside partly as a consequence of constraints on m onetary policy from the zero 2/2-3/99 91 bound in Jap an and from  the des ire to gain credibility and im pose discipline on fiscal policy in the Euro zone. Financial markets looking at the in form ation on the U.S. and foreign econom ies have taken out their previous  expectations of ease, but they have not built in any odds of a tighteni ng in the foreseeable f uture. With inflation low and expected to rem ain contained for som e time, and with econom ic prospects around the globe stil l more likely to be dism al than encourag ing, the poten tial benef its of sitting tigh t may be seen as outweighing the potential costs of ri sking a possible future buildup of inflation p ressures. As a rem inder, the im plem entation of the new announcem ent policy is slated to begin in March, after it has been published in the Minutes and explain ed by the Chairm an in his testim ony. Should the C ommittee change the s ymmetry in the directive or  otherwise feel that it has m ade a significant change in its view of th e risks, an ann ouncem ent of that without this preparation m ight pr ovoke an especially sharp market reaction and  an expectation of i mminent tightening. In any event, the Comm ittee will have an  opportunity  to give a nu anced view of its assessm ent of the econom ic and polic y outlook in the m onetary policy report and testim ony on February 23. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions  for Don?  President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Don, I have a couple of tec hnical questions and then a comment. On page 10 of the Bluebook there is a reference th at says “the real funds rate is now at its natural rate.” I am familiar with what an equilib rium  real ra te is; I don’t know what a “natural” fu nds rate is. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I was using it as a synonym  for the equilibriu m real  rate, as in th e “natural rate” of une mploym ent--the sam e thing. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Turning to Chart 4, the top ri ght-hand chart, I was a little surprised at the difference in real f unds rates in the simulations, particularly the one called “Lower NAIRU.” Why would that p roduc e analytically  such a differe nt real equ ilibrium  rate? The equilibrium  rate has to be there som ewher e. Do these co nverge in so me year some time out in the future at som ething different  from 3 percent?  I’m asking because I don’t think of the equilibrium  real funds ra te as being 3 percent. Do you? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Let m e address the first que stion f irst: Why is the rate with the lower NAIRU lower than the other two? 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Or why is the nom inal rate so low  in tha t simulation ? 2/2-3/99 92 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. The reason is that the econom y can produce at a substantially higher level with a NAIRU that is one per centage point lower than assumed in the baseline. As a consequence, interest rates need to  be lower to stim ulate th e dem and to use that additional production. That is a level adjustm ent of production out into the infinite future. Production can be higher by a couple of percentage points than at the higher NAIRU, and a lower interest rate is needed to stim ulate the dem and to use the extra production that is now av ailable at the lower NAIRU. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Don, I m ight suggest that another w ay to thi nk of this is as follows: If the NAIRU is really more like 4½ per cent, we m ight be ar ound the NAIRU now and looking at the prospect of a st eady inflation path, which is th e sign that we are essentially around the natural rate of intere st. That’s different from  what is in our forecast, which suggests that we are headed toward an accele ration of prices at th e prevailing level of interest rates. I think that’s a very simple way to look at that. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I see. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. As for the level of the natura l rate, it is h igher than it ha s been in some of the past forecasts, although as I not ed it drifts down over tim e as the wealth-to-incom e ratio drifts down. I think the height is a result of the fact th at the wealth-to-incom e ratio is a lot higher than we thought it was--or thought it was going to be a year or two ago--given what has happened to the stoc k market. Dem and has be en m uch stronger. In effect the experience, in term s of the level of the wealth -to-incom e ratio and the strength of dem and at previous interest rate s, has led us to think that the n atural or equilibrium  rate is a lot higher than we used to  believe and a lot higher  perhaps than it has been in history. If the strength of dem and for producers’ durable equipment and so forth persis ts, th e saving ra te, even if  it is creep ing up, is going to be lo wer th an it has b een historically, and then the natura l real rate will be high relative to history. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Interesting. I have a co mment about the simulations. They suggest that we are going to ha ve to m ake decisions in the ne xt year or so that indicate whether or not we are serious about price stab ility. Secondly, if I can  go back to one of my favorite topics, which is opportunism --clearly locking in the gains to date--there are not m any simulations w here we lock them  in, are there? 2/2-3/99 93 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Except for that p rice stabil ity one, which does a little m ore than lock them  in, that’s right.  But that is th e underlying prem ise of the staff forecast that you all talked about yesterday: That the econom y is produci ng a bit beyond its potential. How m uch beyond is un known, but it’s som ewhat beyond. In the staff for ecast the assum ption is that po tential is at a lev el of unem ployment nearly a percentage point higher than where it is r ight now and that ultimately, over tim e, that is going to show through in inflation. If you believe that  analysis, the sim ulations show you the implications of that analysis and those assu mptions. And then in fact, yes, nom inal and real inte rest rates will h ave to r ise from here. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. It is very troubl ing that PCE inflation is 2¾ percent in  all of the alternatives but one. In that one it is 2 percent. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Right. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. The s ame simulations five years ago had a wholly different lev el with the s ame model, as I re call. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. That is true. You only know wha t you know at a given tim e. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Mr. Chairm an, during my years in Chicago, I know I chatted with  Milton Friedm an about the na tural rate of unem ployment, but I have m anaged to spend about 58 years of my life without ev er hearing that the NAIRU was confusing econom ists by its existen ce. So, taking advantage of not being a Ph.D. econom ist, let m e tell you what I see in co mparing Charts 3 and 4, or at least give a possible interpretation. Chart 3 says that this is the world that used to exist and, based on the last couple of years of experience, probably does not exist any m ore. But central b ankers are supposed to be hardboiled fighters against infl ation, so let’s make believe that the world is the way it used to be and launch oursel ves into a fight agai nst inflation. Chart 4 says  that this is the world tha t we in fact have been living in rather successfully for the last couple of years. It doesn’t appear to m e that we have to m ake an act of faith that it will co ntinue forev er in order to think th at this world, w hich produces a much better clim ate for our citizens, could be  allowed to continue . We may get som e 2/2-3/99 94 evidence tha t in fact this is not th e real world- -that it has involved a series of lucky breaks and that the real world is going back to som ething m ore like what is depicted in Chart 3. If we do get such evidence, we would not want  to be in a position of believing that Chart 4 will last fo rever b ecaus e that would  lead us to make m istakes that would  be quite dangerous if  in fact the world of Chart 3 were  the real world. But based on what we have been seeing, even though we do not fully unders tand it, the world of Chart 4 seem s to m e closer to the world we now appear to be living in. And I’m  not sure why we shouldn’t give that world a chance to endure. Am I missing som ething? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I wondered whether that was a question or not! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. I had to put in a question m ark at the end because this is the tim e for questions.  My questio n is: W ould the gentleman not agree? [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. The gentlem an would agree. A ke y elem ent in inte rpreting what has happened over the last few years is this: To what extent has th ere been a fundamental shift in the structure of labor and product m arkets that will persist?  And to what extent do the favorable results of the last few years st em at least partly from  factors that are not funda mental to labor and product m arkets such  as the very sharp appreciation of the dollar through the m iddle of 1998 that lowere d import prices, the collapse of economies abroad, th e collap se of comm odity prices and sim ilar developm ents? These factors n ot only lowered inflation directly but helped  keep inflation expectations down. In effect, the  staff has chosen to assu me it was a little of each.  We used to have, not that long ago, a NAIRU of 6 per cent or perh aps a little more than 6 percent. We have interpreted the good inflation num bers as reflecting in part a lowering of the NAIRU by ½ or ¾ percentage point, depending on what day we talk to people about it, and in part as the product of som e of these othe r factors. But I to tally agree that it is in large m easure a judgm ent call. The reason we showed Chart 4 was to indicate that if you had the other interpretation--tha t the favorable inf lation resu lts reflected almost entirely a change in struc ture an d that the de clining oil p rices and rising dollar really  were not im portant factors--then you would com e out wi th the lower NAIRU pat h as shown in Chart 4. These two charts were an effort to give you a way of doing what you just did, which is to compare across charts an d make a ju dgment. But the key jud gment rela tes to what 2/2-3/99 95 accounts for the good price perform ance of the last three years and what is the m ix between a change in s tructure and o ne-tim e price effects. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. In a sense there is som e link between what you just said and what the Chairm an said earlier. I may not have  known exactly what char ts the Chairm an had in mind from prior years’ sim ulations, but if you view what has happened as having benefited from  som e supply-side shocks, basically those things  have becom e engrained in the inflation expectations . And as long as  the Co mmittee follows a policy  that doesn’t lead to excessive pressu res in the market, it can consolidate that progress and continue the lower path. But if thes e are transitory developm ents and you pretend or hope that they are changes in th e structure, then you c ould be faced with a very sev ere turnarou nd. And what we could be looking at a year or  two from  now is a m uch-elevated set of simulations of inflation paths going forward. It is a judgm ent call that each of you has to make at this point as to just what has  led to  the p ositiv e surp rises on inflation. It’s not at all clear that it is entire ly due to perm anent structural changes. I think one can see clear risks in the m edical care m arket, for exam ple, that the benefits from  som e structural changes there m ay have run their course a nd th at costs pressu res are turning things around in that area. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. If I c ould m ake a comm ent: I think an appropriate degree of skepticism  is no doubt appropriate. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. As always. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. That is by defi nition a safe statem ent! President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Don, having looked at the analysis in the Bluebook and at the various charts, including Chart 3, and having listened to your comments this m orning, I want to talk a little about so mething I m entioned yesterday. That is the possibility of wanting to unwind the actions we took earlier. Last fall we were projecting growth in the fourth quarter to be less than half the growth we apparently got, and we were expecting even lower growth in the first quarter of this year. We took actions to ease partly because of those projections and the financial turm oil that was occurring. We have m oved into a much m ore stable financial environm ent. You did m ention the idea of perhaps unwinding our easing m oves. I assum e for the sake of discussion that one reason we are 2/2-3/99 96 not looking more favorably at unwinding at this juncture is  the continuing concern and uncertainty about external factors. Is that why you touched on it but did not really develop an alternative for unwinding our earlier actions? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I mentioned it as a possibility. That is, to th e extent that you were buying insurance against a hurricane and th e hurricane season has passed and you don’t expect another season, then you don’t need th e insurance. But in part the decision involves a judgm ent, in term s of the risks, as  to whether the hurricane season really has passed, if I can stretch the m etaphor beyond its  breaking point. [Laughter] Certainly most of us were pleasantly surprised by how  well the financial m arkets, not only in the United States but in other Latin Am erican c ountries, weathered the Br azilian crisis. But the cr isis is not over ye t, so that is s till a po tential issue. The other thing that has happened over the last couple of m onths is that we all were probably once again surprised not only by the strength of the economy but by how well behaved inflation h as been excluding the to bacco price increas es. In particular, the ECI and nom inal wage com pensation have exhibited very good perfor mances. That is another factor you m ight think about going forward. We’ve not only had positiv e surprises on the real side, but we have som e pleasant surprises still com ing in on the p rice side to balance the other concerns. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. That’s a good point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. I’d like to address the point that Bob Parry brought up on whether we have locked in progress on infla tion. Let m e refer everybody to Chart 13 that Dave Stockton showed yesterday. The bottom  panel of that chart show s that if  we take out food and energy in the PCE and use the ca pacity utilization approach, which is in effect a proxy for the lower NAIRU--or in Bill McDonough’s term s the issue of whether the present situation can go on--i n fact, we have locked it i n. The only reason there is a little up tick in Chart 4 is because of food and energy prices. It may be that we want ev en more aggressive action to get to  lower inflation. But if it is  true that something like the present reg ime can go on, which m eans either th at capa city utiliza tion could be a standard or tha t NAIRU is at abo ut the cu rrent leve l of the unem ployment ra te, then arguably we have locked in our gains. 2/2-3/99 97 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I don’t understand that. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. Well, in Chart 13 the inflation rate actually goes down. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. What about its behavior in term s of the long-run sim ulation on Chart 4 of the Bluebook? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. Chart 13 is a long-r un sim ulation of PCE without food and energy, and the inflation rate actually goes down in that sim ulation. Apparently the only reason it goes up in Chart 4 is food and energy. So if we lock in the endogenous part of prices, leaving aside food and en ergy, then I think we could ar guably say that this regim e does lock in the progress on inflation. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. But that’s not true in te rms of the long-term  simulation shown on Chart 4, which goes beyond the year 2000. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. They give slightly different results. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. If you thought that the capaci ty utilization equation was the m ore accurate equ ation in terms of predicting PCE, then as you rem arked yesterday, Governor Gram lich, it would be very m uch like the lower NAIRU situation. It would indicate that the structure of the econom y had changed and that capacity u tilization was  a better measure than the unem ploym ent rate. Then you would be in the lower N AIRU world rathe r than the unem ploym ent rate world. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. You don’t even need a structur al change. If som ehow, for reasons we don’t understand, capacity ut ilization really is the true  measure rather than the unem ployment rate, then that sim ulation refl ects the fact that the level of  econom ic activ ity is ac tually below  the natu ral rate of capacity utilization . There is s lack in th e econom y, putting down ward pressu re on inflation. If you were lookin g at the unem ployment rate and you thought the NAIRU was 4½ percent or a little below, it would be a close call. We are in the nei ghborhood, but that means we would not have the depressing effect that we would have by looki ng at capacity utilization. What we noted yesterday is that, as an approxim ation, that ap proach m ay be telling us roughly the same story and not that we are a point below som ebody’s notion of the NAIRU  at this juncture. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. So, for these purposes a ny differences are sm all, they  are hard to predict in the long run, and they may not concern us too m uch. 2/2-3/99 98 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I would ju st add a no te of caution o n the bas is of bitter expe rienc e, which does not have to be repea ted adm ittedly. When one studies th e history of  the p ast few cycles, it is not unusual to see a tendenc y to r einterpret capacity constrain ts becau se the inflation turnaround isn’t in sight. I think it is m anifest  in the current episode that there h ave been extraord inary shock s in term s of world activity, exchange rate move ments, declining im port prices, and stru ctural changes in various m arkets. And there m ay be still m ore structural changes on the horizon after the el ectricity deregulation and so on. A lot of these developm ents are, in the abstract, in th e nature of one-tim e shocks, which we can’t depend on being repeat ed. But we can consolidate the gains we have m ade if we are able to figure out where that level of sustaina ble resource utilization is in th is model. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Rivlin. 

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN. This is not so m uch a que stion as a plea for perhaps a different structuring of the problem next tim e around. I think the difference between the world depicted in Charts 3 and 4 is very inte resting, but it becom es dram atic only if one assum es that we stay with the policy im plied by one or the other for a very long tim e. I don’t know whether we are in the w orld of Chart 3 or Chart 4, and asking m e to decide is silly. There is no way I can know that. What we have to focus on, given that we don’t know and that the truth is likely somewhere in between, is what the co sts are of m aking a mistake and how to m ove back from  one to the other if we do m ake a m istake. I don’t know how you could help us think about that, bu t that is what I believe w e need to be thinking about for the next several m eetings.

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. When I  raised m y hand, I didn’t know there would be so m any people talking after Bill McDonough. I basically wanted to associate m yself with his remarks. I would associate m yself with Ali ce Rivlin’s com ments, too. We now have had three years during which econom ic growth has be en faster than m ost people’s estim ate of potential and the unem ploym ent rate has been  below m ost people’s estimate of NAIRU. Three years is a long tim e. So, we have a real econom y that we can m atch up against simulations, and I’m  not sure why we wouldn’t use the real econom y rather than som e of the sim ulations. I don’t know if you rem ember the com edian Richard Pryor, but if he 2/2-3/99 99 were here he would say som ething like:  Who are you going to believe--m e and m y simulations or your own lying eyes?

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I am struck as I look at  Chart 4 that we are being asked to make an either/or decision. That is, we ha ve to think either that the NAIRU has dropped or that adverse price shocks are going to hit us. Is there no simulation that actually suggests som e of both--that the NAIRU m ay indeed be below 5.3 percent, and perhaps at 4½ percen t, but also that these o ther special f actors have been hitti ng us?  It strikes m e that that does not necessarily end up bei ng your baseline because your baseline has a somewhat different set of assum ptions in it.  Even though I unders tand what Bob McT eer had to say about believing your own lying eyes in som e sens e, is there a sim ulation that does a little of both?  I’m sure that is doable, but is there one that has been done? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. We have not done that, though th e baseline does do a li ttle of that in the sense tha t the NAIRU in the bas eline is c onsiderab ly low er than it would have been a couple of years ago. That’s part of what the Chairm an was talking about. But the baseline does take som e of the favorable pr ice and output news as stemming from  supply shocks. We have not done an interpolation with an assum ption, say, that the NAIRU is 5 percent. But we could easily do that. One can do that visually by looking between the two charts. Then in f act the in terest rate would be a little too low, but not a lot. The Comm ittee would have to tighten at som e point, but the urgency of a m ove would perhaps be less than indicated in the baseline . One can do an ocular regression and figure out that we are som ewhere in the m iddle of these two scenarios. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Okay. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I should note that we did the sim ulation showing the adverse price shocks, the dotted lines in Chart 4, in part to illustrate the power of supply shocks. Those are not very big supply shocks relative to  the baseline assumptions. There is a $5 difference in the price of oil and a 1 percen t faster growth in benefits costs, which translates into only ¼ percent faster grow th in compensation. Those supply shocks notice ably raise the inf lation r ate. And with the Fed leaning agains t increasing inflation-­not in a really aggressive way but at least by raising the funds rate  right away--we get a higher unem ploym ent rate and a higher infla tion r ate simultaneously with these adv erse 2/2-3/99 100 shocks. Think about the flip side of that. We have had a lot of favorable shocks over the last couple of years, and that has given us  both lower unem ployment and lower inflation than we would have expected. The dotted lin e was put th ere in par t to let the Comm ittee members think about that and about what might have been if  we had not had the favorable price shocks over the last few year s. These price shocks are very powerful in shaping econom ic perform ance. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Let m e ask one other th ing on the locking-in point. Ned was going back to Chart 13, but doesn’t the bottom panel of Chart 4 get to the issue of the long term ? That strikes m e as sugge sting that even if one believes the NAIRU has dropped to the 4½ percent you have assum ed ther e, we will end up in the long run with a PCE excluding food and energy of about 2 percent. I think th at goes back to Bob Parry’s question. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. If I understand the construc tion of  this--please correct m e if I’m wrong, Don--basically this repres ents the staff’s baseline a ssumptions naturally extended, at least for the near term . Those assum ptions  include a rebound in o il prices and the turn of the dollar and so on. So in a sense this is already the lower NAIRU pa th. It adjusts down the NAIRU, but it doesn’t remove that m odest reversal of the favorable supply shocks that we have experienced. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Including most im portan tly the depreciation of  the dollar. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Okay, thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I am attracted som ewhat to  the construct that Alice talked about of not really knowing where we  are between Chart 3 and Char t 4, because I really don’t know how much of the good news we have been  hearing for the last  couple of years is temporary or perm anent. But I am  drawn to thinking about w here we were last August or even last July. At that tim e, with the fed funds rate 75 basis points higher than it is currently, m any of us were thinking--using th e usual constructs and equations and so forth and given the resource constraints--that we were facing a real risk of an inflationary increase over the forecas t horizon. Some of that, not a lo t, was built into the Greenbo ok forecast as well. At that point, with the fed funds rate 75 b asis points hig her than it is now, I think we were still be tting that we were som ewher e between Chart 3 and Chart 4. 2/2-3/99 101 We thought we faced an adverse sho ck stemm ing from  developm ents in financial m arkets that we expected to have a big im pact on the real econom y. We m oved the funds rate lower, but the expected impact on the econom y did not m aterialize. So where is our betting now?  Our betting, it se ems to m e, is m uch m ore weighted than it was last summer toward the v iew that ev eryth ing has ch anged. A lot of us were not com fortable with that bet last summ er. So why isn’t Tom Hoenig’s logic in favor  of reversing a little of the easing not good logic now as a tactical matter, if not as a worry about near-term inflation? I would view that as a way of  expressing where we think we really are between Charts 3 and 4. Is that a question?  I am trying to f ind a question! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. One reaction, though, is that in a sense you are beginning to bring Chart 5 in to the pic ture. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. That raises the question of whether som e of the dem and-shock surprises we  have been e xperien cing will be sus tained. My se nse of  the discussion yesterday, as we were thinking about the colo ration of the Humphrey-Hawkins report, is that this group m ight see great er risks that we will have stronger dem and, other things equal, th an is assum ed in the current staff forecast. It does raise the ques tion of whether you want to blend in som e of the flavor of  Chart 5 in term s of the policy content. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. This is really a que stion, even though it m ight sound like a comment! [Laughter] If we try to choose be tween the world in Char t 3 and the world in Chart 4, I think we have to be som ewhat a gnos tic and have a fair am ount of hum ility. But as long as we’re being hum ble and as long as we’re being som ewhat agnostic, how do we know there isn’t a Chart 5 that represen ts a different world?  How do we know that the NAIRU couldn’t be 4 or 3½ percent?  If one goes back, for exam ple, to the 1960s there was a lot of talk that we could have price stability and unem ploym ent rates of 3½ percent or certainly 4 percent. I think the term  used was “3 to 4 percent.” I don’t know whether that is realistic or not. I believe if  any of us had been asked two or three years ago if we thought we could have a 4½ percent unem ploym ent rate and inflation still falling, we would have said that was a pretty nutty idea. How do we know that the string has run out? How do we  know that we can’t hav e a still b etter world ? The question is 2/2-3/99 102 whether we have looked at that  possibility analytically. I ask because I think we do have some historical experience where unem ploym ent of 3 to 4 percent without rising inflation was considered realistic. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. That proved to be an error,  in a sense. The econom y got very overheated partly becau se of  the optim ism about how low an unem ployment rate cou ld be sustained without inflation. To go back to what your eyes have  been perceiving, labor manifest in the labor m arkets. Now, that  hasn’t fed all the way through to prices, depending on what m easure one exam ines. If one looks at the core CPI adjusted for the technical changes, that has been accelerating. The PCE m easures a nd the GDP m easures look a whole lot better. The answer is not entirely cl ear. We may have ha d a productivity surprise that helped. We could get another. I think the case for a substantially lower level of  unemploym ent that is sust ainable without a buildup of inflation is perhaps a bit wishful, though I can’t rule it out. But we on the staff resist that notion pretty strongly at this point. I would not be as resi stant to the notion that the NAIRU m ight be below 5 percent or maybe significantly below 5 pe rcent. It is hard to be strongly opp osed to th at notion based  on recen t experien ce. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Chart 3 has a price stability sim ulation, which Chart 4 does not have. I have what I think is a sim ple question. Roughly speaking, what would the federal funds path be in Chart 4, assum ing the NAIRU were lower but the sam e end result--converging on ¾ percentage point less inflation per year than the baseline--is desired? To get that in Chart 4, presum ably we would have a federal funds rate somewhere between the baseline and  the dot-das h line. Is that correct? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Right. On Chart 3 there is a difference of about 2 percentage points between the inflation rates, and you’re talking about a scenario that m ight result in an inflation rate roughly one per centage point lower than the baseline. So I would take about half the difference between the real f unds rates of the tw o sim ulations on Chart 3 and load it into Chart 4 to get the inf lation rate f or that scena rio. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. So Chart 4 is built under the assu mption that we are satisf ied to converge m ore or less on the existing rate of  inflation. That addr esses the question of 2/2-3/99 103 what we have to do if the NAIRU is lower, if we’re satisfied with where we are on th e inflation rate. But for those who have an objec tive of a lower rate of  inflation, we’d need to add that to Chart 4 in our discussion of the implications for policy of Chart 4. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Right. Looking back at Ch art 3, you would have to tighten by about ½ percentage point, let’s say, in the ne ar term , but run with a substantially higher real funds rate over the next couple of years,  though not as high as in the price stability case. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. A sim ple rule-of-thum b exerci se using our m odel is that a 100 basis point higher funds rate imp lemented imm ediately and su stained would knock about ¼ percen tage p oint or a little m ore off  the inf lation rate in the f irst yea r. The inflation ra te in the second year would be about ¾ percentage point lower. I suspect there would be overshooting in term s of getting that inflation rate to flatten out. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. A hundred basis points sounds too--

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I think that would be mo re than enough to get you there very prom ptly, so Don’s response of perhaps ½ percentage point sounds about right. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. At the beginning of this traj ectory, where we are right now, even if the NAIRU is as low as 4½ percent we need a higher funds rate to start to work the inflation rate down or we are at risk of actually s eeing th e inflat ion rate rise. That is what the baseline tells us even  at the curr ent unem ploym ent rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Right, that’s the lower NAIRU sce nario. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Anybody else?  If not, let m e get started and try to focus on som e of the sam e issues that m any of you raised. The Comm ittee discussion that we ha d yesterday elicited general agreem ent around the table that, with the exception of energy, agricultu re, and som e manufacturing and m ining industries, th e econom y has been exh ibiting sub stantial, and what m any analysts regard as unsustainable, strength. The strength is esp ecially ev ident in in terest-sensitive areas such as housing and light m otor vehicles. That, of course, would suggest that our m onetary stance is too loose a nd unless econom ic growth slows quickly, the failure to tig hten will reaccelerate inf lationa ry pressures. Many of you have noted th at the sequence of crises and decided weaknesses abroad cl early have had no broadly negative impact on the rate of growth in  the United States, at least not yet. 2/2-3/99 104 I have not heard it argued specifically, but  our 75 basis point action las t fall was directed at countering a freezing-up of financial markets, which constituted a demonstrable threat to th e stability of our economy, a nd arguably we have largely succeeded. It is tru e that one can still obs erve so me residual im pact of the liqu idity problem s that we have experienced, with yields on junk bonds re maining significantly above Treas uries and ev en obligatio ns ra ted A and AA still running spreads agains t Treasuries that we haven’t seen for a very long tim e. If it is co rrect that we have succeeded, then one could argue th at we ought to reverse at least part of our easing moves. There has been a legi timate concern abo ut stock p rices that, as an  inadvertent side effect of our easing actions, have retu rned to  record leve ls--a dev elopment that clearly has augm ented effective dem and. All of this makes a com pelling case, indee d. There is little question in m y mind that, unless we see a pronounced slowing in  the expansion of econom ic activity, som e form of preemptive actio n may be called fo r. I say “preem ptive” becaus e there is remarkably little ev idenc e that inf lation pressu res are building. There is none in the data, and I heard very little commentary about price pressures in our round-table discussion yesterday. Everyone was arguing that the pressures were ther e, but no one was saying, at least that I h eard, th at an ything was happening to prices as a consequence. Indeed, the CPI change for Decem ber, if we tak e out the tobacco price in creas e, was slightly neg ative for the total CPI and only slightly po sitive for the core CPI. The sam e is essentially tr ue for the PCE data. If this is inflation, som ething is wrong with  our data system . The poi nt is that we are at the tail end of a series of  years in which, by all our historic m easures, growth has been above trend. Price pressu res should be m ounting at this stage, but instead they are going in the other direction. This involve s, in m y judgm ent, a m ajor issue that w e need to understand before we  move forward with a policy shift. The discussion that has just been joined  relates precisely to this issue. I find the resum ption in the fourth quarter of the steep decline in the num ber of those seeking work to be the m ost compelli ng evidence of an unsustainable, and perhaps an unstable, econom ic expansion. That statis tic, of course, includes the unem ployed plus those not in the labor force w ho nonetheless say they would li ke a job if they could get one. You may recall that thr ough the first three quarters of  last year we had a sharp 2/2-3/99 105 divergence between the still strong growth of payroll em ployment and the apparently stagnant growth indicated by the household data. The surge in household em ploym ent and the decline in unem ploym ent in recent m onths have now fully closed the gap. Our great dilemma is that although the la bor m arket has tightened, and tightened quite appreciably in a statistica l sense, gains in compensation per hour have slowed! It is not that they haven’t risen, but their growth  has slowed. Doubtless, the E CI change for the fourth quarter is biased downward. As I have indicated before and as a num ber of you have argued, it is very likely that to som e extent wage increases are being m asked as prom otions in one for m or another. But ev en if the ECI is biased in that regard, compensation per hour is not. Preliminary da ta for com pensation per hour in the fourth quarter, at least for the n onfinancial corporat e sector that I believe  probably m irrors the total, indicate an average annual growth rate  of 3.7 percent. That is dow n from  an average of about 4 percent in a num ber of prev ious quarters. Indeed, for the nonfinancial corporate sector, it was running 4.4 percent in the m iddle part of la st year on a four-quarter-change basis. For the fourth quarter of last year, year-ove r-year, it was estim ated at 4 percent. Moreover, despite our tightened labor m arkets, when we disaggregate the data, there is only very weak evidence of signifi cantly g reater com pensation gains in are as where the unem ploym ent rate is demonstrably  below the national average. The national average unemploym ent rate currently is 4.4 percent. Gary Stern was m entioning yesterday that Minneapolis had a 1½ percent unemploym ent rate. Their m anufacturing wage increases over the past two years have be en close to the nationa l average. If we look at other cities, Boston with an unem ployment rate of 2.2 pe rcent has had average hourly earnings increases over the last two years only som ewhat higher than the national average. Indeed, the on ly two cities  on m y list with low unem ploym ent rates tha t have experienced wage increases significantly a bove the national average are C harlotte and Richm ond. What are you doing, right or wrong, Al ? [Laughter] San Francisco has a 2½ percent unem ployment rate, an d its average hourly earnings  growth over the last two years is about average. Denver unemploym ent is 2.6 percent, and its average wage incre ase is well below the nation al average, as indeed are the increases for Phoenix and Dallas. So, there is ve ry little eviden ce, gran ted a ll the qualif ication s we want to m ake 2/2-3/99 106 with rega rd to these da ta, that the NAIRU is  alive and kicking. It may exist, but it certainly is in hiding, no m atter how we look at it. Using NAIRU in our structural models is in effect like using a phantom . Chart 4 in the Bluebook is the real world; the NAIRU got lost som ewhere. If we look at com pensation gains, th ey are virtually fully m atched by the acceleration in productiv ity. Total unit costs over the four qu arters of 1998 rose just 0. 2 percent. Indeed, unit labor costs for nonfinancial corpora tions over the latest four quarters, as estim ated by Larry Slifman who never m akes a mistake, increased only 0.2 percen t. That es timate is com prised of compensation per hour of 4 percent, as I mentioned before, and productivity growth of  3.8 percent. The productivity growth figure for the fourth quarter is 4.8 percent, pr eceded by 4.7 percent in th e third quarter. Clearly, something is happening. As I said  before, absent the cigarette price hike, we cannot find inflation in either the CPI or  the P CE index for Decem ber, and we surely do not find it in the pipeline data anywhere in  the system . I subm it that in terpr eting th ese results requ ires a fundam ental reass essment of  how we look at the world.  I will take a shot at this and try to de scribe what I think we kn ow and what we don’t know. How is it possible, first, for hourly com pensation growth to be flat or falling in an ever-tightening labor m arket?  Let m e begin by suggesting what does not explain it. You m ay recall that two or three years ago I was arguing that fear  of job obsolescence was a m ajor factor suppressing the nom inal increase in com pensation per hour. That factor clearly has not gotten worse; if anyt hing, it has eased. The International Survey Research Company is the source of the data  that I was quoting back in 1995 and 1996, as you m ay rem ember. When workers were asked whether they frequently were concerned about being laid off, 46 percent responded “yes” in 1995 and 1996 com pared with figures in the teens or in the twen ties throughout the 1980s. The 46 percent number is now down to 37 percent. Statistics on job leavers, another indicator I would use, likewise do not indicate any significant change. So an increase in uncertainty and the fear of job loss amongst workers cannot account for this ex traordinary com bination of lo w unem ployment and no acceleration in hourly co mpensation. The evidence, anecdotal and otherwise, suggests that the explanation lies in pressure com ing from  employers, who have app arently los t virtu ally all pric ing power--2/2-3/99 107 an issue that a num ber of you raised in our discussion yesterday. We saw quite sim ilar episodes during the long period of the gold st andard, which produced price stability on average p rior to th e 1930 s, although obviously th ere was a lot of price volatility. During that period, wage increases were limite d by the exogenous price capping of the gold standard. The technologically driven pr ocess that is breaking down barriers to cross-border trade today has apparently created an envir onment tha t simulates th e old g old stand ard forces. One way of looking at th is is that in earlier decades wh en there m ay have been excess capacity o r exces s potential in one part  of the world, it didn’t m atter becaus e that excess could not be m oved to another part of the world. But in the current m ore technologically advanced envi ronm ent, as barriers com e down we get an increase in potential supply relative to to tal actual physical capacity in  the world econom ic system. And it is conceivable, but by no m eans provable,  that g lobalization --the m ajor force that people are talking about--m ay be having an impact on the price level, and our price measures may be reflecting that. It may also be , with regard to m y previous discussion of compensation gains, that the data are capturing that phenom enon, although the argum ent I am making is global as distinct fr om a specific m anufacturing issue. The argum ent is basically that tradable goods prices are being significantly held down by excess world capacity and that the arbitraging into the nontradable goods areas that occurs within econom ies, largely thr ough w ages, is the reason why service price inflation, which arguably has very little in th e way of direct international globalization components, also has been restrained appreciably. In the United States this process has been augm ented by a dram atic increase in th e backlog of new technol ogies, which is an issue we have discussed in the past. This re ally gets down to the question of whether the synergies that have evolved over recent ye ars have created a la rge pool of potential capital investm ents that firm s can dip into to ob tain a rate of return in exces s of the cost of capital. We have seen cons iderable evid ence of  this in th e sense tha t rates of  return everywhere seem  to be moving up. There has been a very interesting pic kup since 1994 in the aver age rate of price computers, comm unications equipm ent, and other high-tech goods was going down at an 2/2-3/99 108 annual rate of about 4 percent. Starting in 1994, the rate of price decline fell off the chart, and th e most recent data suggest that high -tech prices are dropping at an annual rate som ewhere in the area of 17 to 18 percent.  Thus, even though that sector’s share of GDP is only a few percent, these price declin es are having an appr eciable influence on the over all inf lation r ate. What this implies is that we are gett ing a rapid increase in opportunities for investm ent in new technol ogy. It is overwhelm ing the expansion of demand, and the acceleration in the down ward adju stment of prices suggests that we have a very large backlog of unexploited investm ents that, as they are im plem ented, are dis placing labo r and ef fectuating a ve ry significant increas e in m ultifactor pro ductiv ity. That in turn h as spilled over into labor productivity. Indeed, estim ates produced by the staff’s econom etric m odel suggest that we have seen a f airly dram atic pic kup in recent years in multifactor productivity  consistent with this pro cess. I don’t believe that tr ansitory factors can explain the failure of  models to forecast successfully  in recent years. I suspect that wh at we have here is a m issing variable, if  I supply generally appears to be overwhelm ing dem and despite the evident continued seekers--that is, the sum  of une mployed plus those not in the labor force but seeking a job--is currently ten m illion; and it h as been  falling by alm ost one m illion  annually. We have no way to judge how far down that num ber can go before there occurs an inevitable acceleration in nom inal wage dem ands. Unless the laws of supply and d emand have been repealed, there has to be som e level of labor m arket tightness at which nom inal wages begin  to accelerate. The tru th of the matter is th at we don’t know where that is; we only know that the n umber of job seekers h as been redu ced by alm ost a m illion in each of the last several y ears, and no thing has hap pened. That is lik e my falling off a building and saying when I reach the fifth floor on m y way down that I am in great shape. Something has to give, but we don’t know wh en. I think the presum ption that we do know is very difficult to m aintain. The Greenb ook forecast of a renewal of infl ation  statistically rests in part on a 2/2-3/99 109 output per h our. Indeed,  without a s lowing in m ultifactor pro ductiv ity growth, we obviously could not have a deceleration in  labor productivity growth unless we significan tly lowered th e forecast of capital d eepening or lab or qualit y, and that is very unlikely to be the case. So what we have  is a p rojected slowd own in m ultifactor productivity growth, which is based in turn on a substantial slowing in the pace of overall econom ic growth. I am not saying that the inte rnal workings of the m odel actually have that linkage; they do not.  Nevertheless, if  you plot the m ultifactor p roductivity that is implicit in the staff’s forecast along with th e change in econo mic activity,  you will see a fairly high correlation. I assum e that the reason we have this dram atic falloff in multifactor productivity  growth in 1 999, after ve ry strong g ains in the two previous y ears, is the forecasted slowdown in econom ic growth. But if the slowdown in econom ic growth  does not occur, then presum ably productivity growth will not slow  much either. And unless ther e is a really dram atic rise in nom inal wage incre ases, unit cos ts will no t move very m uch. I am having dif ficulty knowing where th is high er inflation in the m odel forecast wo uld com e from if I leave that out. That is especially th e case when the pairing o f multifactor productivity growth an d low unit cos ts is e ssentia lly com bined with an oil price increase to get the CPI increas e. As we discussed yesterday, the oil price incr ease is based on the presum ption that we know m ore than the m arket about the long-te rm direction of the price for W est Texas Interm ediate . Now, that m ay well be  the cas e, bu t histo ry has  been less th an helpf ul in that regard. I would not be t the ranch that one could buy Decem ber futures for W TI and know for certain that it would result in a profit. Our structural and VAR models that are projectin g this pri ce acceleration are not properly specified, in m y judgm ent, unless som e means are found to capture the technologically driven price- capping variable. Lagged depend ent variables do not do it. VARs m ay appear to give us good results, but they are beggi ng the question on the crucial m issing variable. Moreover, it is evid ent that whenever nominal wage pressures have surfaced, producers have chosen to dip into the availa ble technology to substitu te profitable capital for labor. This has m ade the growth of poten tial output per hour vari able; indeed, it’s a function of nom inal wage increases. The reason  is that if nom inal wage increases pick 2/2-3/99 110 up, there is clear evidence in recent years that producers will  endeavor to dip into that untapped pool of technologi cal capital projects. We have had m any anecdotal conversations on this subject. We had a di scussion yesterday in which I mentioned talking abou t this issu e with the he ad of British Telecom . He was saying  that the availability of new technologies and  synergie s is accelerating  at such a p ace that they don’t know what to invest in. Everything is te rrific. It is a question of which of the individual rates of retu rn is higher. They are all above the cost of capital. Larry Meyer mentioned a discussion he had with a senior  Microsoft researcher who was confirm ing the sam e thing. Something different is ha ppening here, and our m odels are m issing a crucial variable. As we all know, when econom etricians ge t regression results that appear out of line with the real world, as Bob McTeer wa s saying, they have to look for the m issing variable. I subm it that there is a m issing variable, and we  are learning m ore about the nature of its characteristics. I think it m ay be about tim e to try to substitute this variable for NAIRU. Let m e put it this way: Neither one is an observable phenom enon, but neither was the planet Pluto before 1930. Scientists figured out that there had to be something there, giv en the exten t to which Ur anus and Saturn were deviating from  their forecast o rbits. Well, I s ubmit that at som e point we are goin g to com e to the conclusion as sta tisticians that the s imultaneity o f a falling inflation rate and an  ever tightening labor whether we can get som e answers that do not gi ve us Chart 3 and Chart 4, which in their present f orm are not ter ribly helpf ul. There is very little evidence at this stag e that the expansion is slowing. I know it is supposed to decelerate signi ficantly in the first quarter, a nd I don’t deny that the m otor vehicle segm ent is going to reduce it by som e 2 percentage points. I also gather that we will get some further deceleration fro m governm ent and probably from  trade. But thes e are forecasts. As of the mom ent, we  have  a 5.6 percent annual rate of growth in the fourth quarter, and th e impression I have is th at that num ber will be revis ed up, not d own. In the first quarter, som e points m ay be ta ken off the possible 6 pe rcent fourth-quarter growth number, but it has to go down by a signif icant am ount. I recognize that productivity  increases cannot explain  all of the g rowth because if they cou ld, then we 2/2-3/99 111 would not be getting a reduction in the tota l number of people who are either unem ployed or out of the work force looking for jobs. So, som ething has to give here at som e point. The inflatio n rate, as we m easure it, is at zero currently; if we got the measure ment right, it probably would be negati ve. Given that there is s till som e bias in these s tatistics, we certainly can wait a while. But it is conceivable that the data we a re going to see in the weeks ahead will confirm something that w e have not seen to date, namely underlying inflationary forces. I don’ t mean strong econom ic growth. That tells us little except that produc tivity is accelerating. But wh at is happening in the labor becom ing significant. We m ay find when the data are published at the end of the week that av erage hourly earnings will sho w a spik e, and we m ay see another s pike the m onth after. Clearly, that would s uggest that som ething different from  what we ’ve been seeing is happening. What I would recomm end after this long discussion is that we stay where we are at the m oment. I would be disinclined to go asymmetric tow ard tighten ing at th is stag e because the data m ay turn out to be s ofter than I s uspect, and f lipping the s ymmetry back and forth would not help us. If it turns out, however, that th e labor m arket data we get on Friday really tighten up or if the data we get on the CPI or the PPI show that som ething is stirring, I think a fairly str ong signal in the Hum phrey-Hawkins testim ony that we m ight tighten would be wholly appropriate. Indeed, I would say it would be highly desirable. I don’t think we have reached that point yet, but I can readily concei ve of the possibility that we will. I would sug gest th at we wait a few week s before we show our hand and leave it for the Humphrey-Hawkins testim ony to sugge st som e asymm etry toward tightening if that seem s appropriate. If I were to sum up the general discussion at this m eeting, I would say that the consensus is probably a sh ade in the direction of asymm etry. I request that we do not adopt asymmetry, but that really depends on our strategy. I don’t sense any pressure to m ove today, but I do detect so me inclination on the part of a significant number of the Comm ittee m embers to m ove in the direction of asymm etry toward tightening. I frankly would prefer n ot to do th at. Whichever way we go will prob ably have zero impact on when and to what extent  we m ove or do not m ove in the weeks 2/2-3/99 112 ahead or on what we decide when we m eet again on March 30. If inflation were not actua lly dea d in the water at this sta ge, I would say that we would have to be far m ore concerned about being p reemptive. I don’t see the necessity f or that at this m oment. Vice Chair.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH. Mr. Chairm an, I fully support your recomm endation. Clearly, it seem s inappropriate  to change policy. And with inflation dead in th e water, I also  believ e this is  not the mom ent to go asymm etric toward tightening.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. I certainly support your recomm endation, Mr. Chairm an. Let m e make a fe w som ewhat random , but hopefully not  too random , comments. First of all, I enjoyed your analysis, especially the point abou t the im portan ce of  global capacity and the arbitrage between the m anufacturing and servi ce sectors. It is som ething I have been trying to con vince m y staff of without a grea t deal of success to  this poin t, and perhaps you have aided in that effort. I must say I am  a little p uzzled by th e fascination  with NAIRU. I thought work done by Stock and W atson and others suggest ed that if there is a NAIRU, it lies somewhere between 4 to 7 percent or som e range like that, wh ich is qu ite wide. If that is right, it is no t a te rribly u seful concept for policy. So, I have  been reluctan t for som e time to go down that path very aggressively. Let m e also add a thought about wages a nd compensation. At least as far as our employees are concerned, and this is confirm ed by the labor leader on our board as well, the issu e we hear m ost about is th e scarcity of tim e. What m any employers are doing--I 2/2-3/99 113 know we are--is offering more flexibility in work hours to m ake it easier for people to do the routine tasks of running a household and taking care of fam ily obligations that obviously take a lot of tim e. My gue ss is th at at the end of the day this is probably productivity enhancing. If it shows up in wage s or com pensation at all, it m ay not affe ct unit labor co sts adversely if it has a positiv e effect on productivity. I am a little suspiciou s about attribu ting a lot of the recen t favorable inflation perform ance to special factors. Back  in m y youth when I was doing bottom -up forecasting, one could always fi nd special factors to explai n virtually every thing. It seem s to m e that this sub dued inflation behavior has gone on long enough now that it probably reflects a lot more than special factors.  And I am  struck by the f act that m ost, if not all, of the m ajor central banks around the world are comm itted to a low inflation policy. The fact that we are getting low infl ation and som e surprises on the downside is perhaps not so surprising, if you get my drift. That to m e is the policy regim e that we probably have in the world today. The one thing that concerns m e in the curr ent situation is a comm unications issue. I have the perception that fina ncial m arket participants and others feel that we cannot change polic y in either d irection in th e current c ircumstances and that we will not. I certainly don’t feel that we should any tim e soon, but I do think we should m ake an effort to comm unicate that ind eed we are p repared to change policy if and when it is appropriate to do so. As for what we m ight point to as a rationale for changing policy in either direction, right now I don’t think there is any such rationale, which is why I cam e out where you did. But it seem s to m e that we would want to put people on notice that indeed we are prepared to m ove under som e circum stances. We m ight want to call people’s attention to m oney growth, exchange  rates, nom inal interest rates, the bond paying attention to those vari ables among other things in as sessing the appropriate stance of policy going forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairm an, I support both halves of your recomm endation. I also want to comment a b it on the strategy, which I strongly endorse. As I said yesterday, in periods when models  do not seem  to be working very well--and 2/2-3/99 114 we seem  to be in one of those period s--I th ink it is quite im portan t to weig h the incom ing data m ore heavily. To som e extent that is what you were suggesting. That doesn’t mean that ou r han ds are tied in any sense. It does m ean that onc e the data beco me clearer, we should be prepared to move. And I sense that that is where we are. I’d say one other thing. You put som e emphasis, appropriately, on productivity. But we are aware that productivity is quite cy clically related, and I’m  not sure we have parsed out those cyclical differences well enoug h yet. There m ay be some studies of the data that do that. One of the things we have to continue to  look at is the degree to which we can pull apart the cyclical com ponents fr om the underlying changes in productivity. I also would  agree with Presiden t Stern’ s point with respe ct to NAIRU. It has never been m easured very accu rately, and I’m  not sure it is going to be m easured any more accurately in the fu ture. It is an  interesting concept, bu t we should not put too much weight on it for policy purposes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I support your  recomm endation. I would like to talk a bit about what I regard as a very important issue, which Larry Meyer em phasized yesterday. And that is that we  need to be talking not just about the s etting of the f ederal funds rate, b ut about the polic y strategy from  which the cu rrent rate settin g arises. It is clear that the central fact occu pying us is this ongoing surprise in the relationship between real activ ity and the rate of inflati on, which we call the Phillips curve. The Phillips curve fram ework has been around in its current form  essentially since the la te 196 0s. We have worked with what we c all the expec tations-aug mented Phillips curve. I believe there is far too m uch emphasis on the NAIRU and not enough em phasis on the expectations part of the behavior in these m arkets. To m e the experience over the last couple of years indica tes that expectations trum p the unemploym ent rate in determ ining the cur rent rate of inflation--tha t the expectation of c ontinuing low inflation is the factor dom inating this outcom e. Firm s say over and over again that they don’t have pricing power, and that is because their com petitors won’t follo w any pri ce incre ases th ey have trie d to put in to place. Competitors beh ave tha t way because th ey think th e inflation rate will rem ain low 2/2-3/99 115 and, therefore, if they can re tain control over their costs, they are happy to grab m ore I agree with you that em phasizing the exch ange rate and oil prices as special factors is not the way to l ook at those variables. Thos e above all are expectational variables. Oil is a storable comm odity. Oil is behaving so well in good part because it is expected that prices will rem ain low in th e future. Oil is not a good store of value any more with the rate of inflation down. The sa me is true of the exchange rate. It has behaved so well becau se of the sustained low rate of inflatio n in the United States. Now, that does not m ean that the unem ploym ent rate is not below what is sustainable in the long run. There are so m any stories about the existe nce of labor m arket pressures and shortages and so forth that we  probably are operating below  the NAIRU. It is just that the expectations part of it is dominating the outcom e in term s of the current rate of inflation. The ideal situation, if we knew how to do it,  would be to peg the rate of inflation at a very low level and go for price stability, letting the real ec onom y run wherever it wants to run. What we would all like to see happen is to have the m aximum  possible employm ent and productivity growth consistent with price stability. The problem  is that there seem s to be so m uch evidence that the real econom y leads the cy clical process, with inflation com ing later. So, to say that we can ignore the real econom y in setting current policy seems to m e likely to be  a mistake in the long run. Therefore, I com e down to sa ying that we are going to have to pay attention to the fact that the real economy is growing very vigorously and that the unem ploym ent rate is low. We should not ignore the anecdotes about very tight labor m arkets. Credit conditions and m onetary growth are both ve ry clearly on the stim ulative side. The financial tur moil that m otiva ted th is Comm ittee last fall appears to be m ostly behind us. Over the course of this year , starting som etime this spring, I think it is going to be appropriate to be tightening up on the funds rate. I would like to com e back to the orig inal point that I was m aking about the importance of expectations. I think we need to do everything we can to seal in this expectational environm ent. That is what m akes all this pos sible in my view. That means that if we get som e bad news on the inflati on rate, we need to be  prepared to pounce in 2/2-3/99 116 order to demonstrate that we are not going to let that continue. To show that we take inflation very seriously is to m e the most constructive thing we can do. Whether or not we want to act before we get som e uptick in inflation is ano ther matter. But we are no t faced with that issu e immediately at this m eetin g. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. I support your “B” symmetric recomm endat ion. I believe watching and waiting is the right ap proach at this point. I think m ost of us feel that we are sitting o n a situ ation  that is re ally very positive; or at least our  experience over the last severa l yea rs has been f avorable. We may have som e inner sense tha t it will not las t or that we a re going to hav e to do som ething ove r the next f ew months. Maybe we will or might be. I do think that when reality tells us som ething different from  the m odels that we ought to take a new look at the m odels. Your contribution this m orning was helpful in that regard. As far as NAIRU is concerned, m y personal view is that it is a useful analytical tool for econom ic research but that it has about zero value in term s of making policy because it b ounces arou nd so m uch that it is very elusiv e. I would not want our po licy have been s o far off in recent years. As far as your testim ony goes, I think it would be appropriate to lay out the possibility that we m ay have to tighten and for you to describe the kinds of circum stances that m ight lead us to that. On the other ha nd, that discussion ought to  be balanced in the sense that th ere m ay be a set of circu mstances  in which we do not have to tighten. So, the possibility of tightening ought to be raised, but the possibil ity that we m ight not have to tighten also ought to be discussed.

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, I am satis fied with your recommendation.

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairm an, I lik e your recom mendation, including the handling of the symm etry issue. I hope, like o thers, that you will use the Hum phrey-Hawkins setting to put people on notice that we are in fact p repared to tigh ten if circum stances suggest that is appropriate. I was particularly please d that you resurrected the notion of “preem ptive” policym aking this m orning, som ething we have gotten further and further away from as we have gotten caught up  in the euph oria of good experiences recen tly. Last nigh t I was reflecting on yesterday’s discussion and I was struck by how m any of us have fallen back on our m odels recently. I know we have all been using them , but we talked about them more yesterday than in the past. I think we  did that perhaps as a second check on our loss of peripheral vision, as a check against just going on our instincts. Those models, even with their flaws and possible m issing variab les--and you gave them  another licking this morning--do  serve to re mind us that there is a da nger of  making the m istake of  waitin g too long to tighten policy and that  there is in fact a price associated with that. So I am pleased that we at least have left th e door open to a preem ptive m ove. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. As my comments over the last couple of days probably have indica ted, I can accep t not changing policy bu t I am a little m ore uncom fortab le with n ot changing the symm etry. In our m eetings last summ er we discussed--though you were m uch m ore expansive in your discussion today--the vari ous aspects of what is going on and how difficult tha t is to m easur e and to cap ture in our equations. But it is  easy to see, if one looks at it closely, that in term s of global capacity and changes in technology and so forth you could h ave given th at sam e speech last July. To som e extent you d id. We had forecasts then that looked toward no change in po licy go ing o ut over a p eriod of several years and the trajectories didn’ t look terribly different from  what we are looking at now, in that growth was a little slower and we had some sm all pickup in inflation. As I recall, 2/2-3/99 118 your Hum phrey-Hawkins testim ony reflected that in July. Some of us we re uneasy then, and we had a bias toward tightening at that point in tim e. What has changed?  We experienced so me financial turm oil. We changed monetary policy to provide protection to the real econom y. The need for that has largely dissipated. We have an easier m onetary policy now, and we have the sam e kinds of concerns that were disturbing me at least in the spring and the ear ly summ er. I’m talking about credit conditions, monetary growth c onditions, stock market conditions, and asset matter what one feels about the future, we could be facing som e real problem s down t he road. The higher everything flies,  the farther it ha s to f all. For m e anyway, it is not a si tuation of when we see the “eyes of inflation” but of what we are building in with regard to overa ll conditions. I think that relates to the expectations issue. It feeds into what pe ople expect. I don’t have any problem  with it right now. But if people continue to see not ju st the sam e market c onditions as last year but those sam e market conditions and an eas ier monetary policy, th ere is  a point where they will begin to think that we aren’t going to change our policy--that nothing can convince us to change in a preem ptive fa shion. That could feed into a negative expectations  process that will de feat us in the end . So I am  very worried about where we are. I do not have a vote so I can’t  dissent, but I am really concerned. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. When I think about the inflation process and the inflation dynam ic, I always point to two things: exces s dem and and special factors. I don’t know any other w ay to think about the proxim ate sources of inflation. When I think about excess dem and, I think about NAIRU. If we  elim inate NAI RU and that concept of excess dem and, it m oves us into very dange rous territory with m onetary policy. I would remind you that in the 20 years prio r to this recent episode, the Phillips curve based on NAIRU was probably the single  most reliable com ponent of any large-scale forecasting m odel. It was very useful  in understanding the inflation episode over that entire period. Certainl y, there is greater uncertainty today about where NAIRU is, but I would be very cautious about prem aturely burying the concept. 2/2-3/99 119 I was also surprised to hear how m any pe ople believe that sp ecial factors --the appreciation of the dollar, heal th care cost developm ents, and so forth, which I feel have been so im portant over this recent episode--ha ve been so immaterial  in their views of inflation. Declines in oil prices from  $26 to $12 per barrel seem to me quite relevant in understanding the recent in flation experience. So, I think we have to keep som e balance in this. Even if productivity growth has m oved upward, we know it has been above trend because we know the unem ploym ent rate h as been  declin ing. So I com e back to m y story about the increm ental Taylor rule. If you thi nk NAIRU is as low as 4½ percent, fine. But that still m eans to me that if the econom y is growing above trend, there is a considerable prospect that it will continue to  do so and that w e should put som e discipline in monetary policy by leaning ag ainst the cy clical winds. Otherwise, ev ery tim e there is an upside de mand shock, we will allo w moneta ry growth to ac celerate to a ccommodate it and wait for the day of reckoning. In term s of symmetry and asymm etry, the risks seem  reasonably balanced around trend growth. Does that m ean we should have  a symmetric or an asymm etric directive? The problem I have is that I believe the initi al conditions are such that we are already operating beyond the point of sustainability in labor m arkets. If we have balanced risks around trend growth, that tells m e that we shoul d have an asymmetric directive. Growth a little lower than trend would not call for a ny easing of m onetary policy, but any growth above trend would call f or a ti ghtening of m onetary policy. Mr. Chairm an, I can certain ly accep t your recom mendation and wait a little longer on the asym metry story. But I hope som e of these concerns will be reflected in your testim ony. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. Mr. Chairm an, I am  happy to support your recomm endation for sitting tight. I think Larry Meyer m ade a useful contribution yesterday. I have been thinking in my own m ind about how to resuscit ate the Taylor rule. I may not agree with everything he said, but I view it as a reasonabl e strategy. One thing it m eans is that as soon as we see eviden ce of any acceleration in in flation, we h ave to m ove against it. I’d say that alm ost everybody around th e table would agree with that. 2/2-3/99 120 Models have taken a hit this m orning, so let m e say a good word for them. For many years they have been a useful fram ework for thinking about the econom y. Actually, I think the staff should be commended for this week’s presentations because they have employed m odels very well in illu strating the issues, even though the m odels did not resolve all uncertainties. The m odels say that we ought to be a little nervous about the current situ ation, and I am , even though I am happy to sit tight and follow your recomm endation. On th e other h and, you and others have m ade som e very telling criticism s of the m odels, and a lot of you set your  staffs to work on points that cam e up at the last m eeting. Some points have com e up at this m eeting that would be worth exploring. Bill Poole raised a point about expectations. For a long tim e, how to factor expectations into the m odels has been a real  puzzle. The treatm ent of expectations has always been fairly haphazard, and it m ay be th at expectations are m uch more im portant now in a different way from  what has been built into the m odels. We ought to take a serious look at that. You also raised a very important point on the price-capping i ssue. I don’t know exactly what adjectives to use to describe it. I consider it importan t; I h ave been m ulling it over m yself. It may be tim e, and there m ay be enough data, to try to work that into the models. Let’s try to have the m odels step up to the challenge and see if they can deal with som e of these issues that clea rly ought to be dealt with. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, in term s of the earlier discussion about the way the world works, I want very much to  believe m y lying eyes but I am having difficulty doing that. I don’t doubt that there is a m issing variable out there. Your point on that is very well taken. But the fact is that we really  don’t know what it is exactly. We do not yet have a very clear understanding of  its strength or its likely persistence. That is the b ackground against which  I will p resent m y own way of approaching th e current situation. The comments tha t Larry Meyer and  Cathy Mine han m ade, and especially Bill Poole’s com ments on expectations, really resona ted with m e in term s of the way I view the world today. It seems to m e that even if we knew what this m issing variable was and could som ehow specify it and analyze it, we still would very likely conclude that 2/2-3/99 121 domestic dem and is growing at an u nsustain able pace. I thin k we would also suspect that in the m onths imm ediately ahead it m ay be sustained and even boosted by the lingering and lagged effects of the easing actions that we took last fall a nd possibly also by the strong growth in the m onetary aggregates. I worry about where all of this is going to take us. What worries m e the m ost now is that the m arkets seem  to be discounting alm ost completely--others have m ade this sam e point--any tightening action on our part, despite these con tinuing upside surprises in the data . At a m inimum we need to send a clear signal that there is at lea st a possibility that at som e point in the near term  we m ight tighten. I think that would help sensitize th e markets. There is a ball gam e going on here and we just are not in it . We need to get back in it in so me way so that if we have to act on short notice, or m aybe on no notice, at leas t we will not be so m uch of a lightnin g rod. I am probably the only person in the room who fe els this way, but I believe one could m ake a case for undoing at this m eeting so me of the easing that we did last fall. Actually, in the Bluebook on page 19 the staff made a good case for that. Of course, they made som e other cases as well. That’s th e problem. [Laught er] Speaking for m yself, I would strongly prefer an asymm etric directiv e this tim e. If we don’t do that, I hope, as you have already sugges ted, Mr. Chairm an, that y ou will stron gly signal in  your testim ony that there are upside risks in the current situation.

We frequently speculate about whether or not this Com mittee should or should not be preemptive. If we believe, and I think we all do, that policy affects the econom y with long an d variable lags, then we should keep in m ind that we are always, ev ery day, unavoidably being preem ptive. Even taking no action at a m eeting is preemptive, in  the sense that any decision is going to impact the econom y a ye ar or two years out, or however long those lags m ay turn out to be. I think it is useful to keep in mind that we are always being preem ptive. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. Quite a few references have been m ade to the role of expectations. I did not com e into this m eeting with any expectation that there would be an adjustm ent in the funds rate at this m eeting. I didn’t know  what the reasons for not making an adjustm ent might be, but I did not expect an adjustm ent. However, I still stand by m y dissent on the cut in the funds rate  taken in Novem ber, and I think it should be reversed. I don’t think this would be the tim e to do it, with  due respect to Al Broaddus and others w hose views are that  perhaps it should be done now. A reason for acting at th is tim e that I w ould not find desirable would be that the econom y is growing too fast. In fact, ther e is a potential that  the econom y would not grow so fast if we tightened at this m eeting. There is the potential for an unfortunate, undesirable m isinterpretation, com ing after last Friday’s report on re al growth, that the Comm ittee thinks tha t there is  too much growth and too m uch em ploym ent and that we are unhappy about that. That w ould not be desirable. In fact, I believe we ought to go the other way by trying to em phasize how delight ed we are with this strong growth, how deligh ted we are with th e low unemploym ent rate, and how delighted we are with low inflation and, therefore, we did not take action. Nevertheless, expectations going forward ar e going to be a dom inant concern to us and to everybody who watches us. As m uch as we and the world are happy that the average level of current consum able goods and service prices is not changing very rapid ly, that is the n ecessary conditio n for successful m onetary policy bu t it is no t a 2/2-3/99 123 sufficient condition. If it were a sufficient condition, we would still be under the gold standard. In fact, the Federa l Reserve would not exist if it were a sufficient condition. We have had cases in our history and cases in other countries’ history w here the present price of claim s to future consum ption m oved very substantially--som etimes too far up and then som etimes very rapidly down. This creates finan cial ins tabilities tha t are unhealthy for the perform ance of an ec onom y. Otherwise, 1907 would not have happened; 1893 would not have happened. Central banks and m onetary policy are designed to try to correct som e of the flaws inherent in a pure gold standard type of environm ent. That m eans that we have to take into account things, such as the present price of future consum ption, that are m issing in our usual m easures of goods and services prices. For som e time, people have been purchasi ng eq uities in the e xpectation of selling them  to somebody else at a higher price, w ith not a thought as to what the earnings potential or real value is--and it’s probably m ore than just my three kids. [Laughter] There are people m aking real estate investm ents for residential and ot her purposes in the expectation that prices can only go up and go up at accelerating rates. Those expectations ultim ately b ecom e destabilizing to th e econom ic system .

MR. MOSKOW . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. It is clear from our discussion that there is a lot we don’t know. I think we all feel this c onflict--I certainl y do--between what econom ic theory and econom ic models are saying on the one hand and what we have seen as  the reality in recen t years. We all have been ov er-forecastin g inflation and under-forecasting growth for at least three years.  Som eone raised the question as to what has changed. The way I look at it, the longer it goes on, the more it becom es such a puzzle and the m ore one questions it. So I certainly agree with  the thrust of your comments that we should be questio ning our forecasting m odels with regard to the h elp they give us in policym aking. But having said that, I am concerned that  our current m onetary policy stance m ay be too loose because of the actions we took la st fall. I don’t think the risk s are strongly skewed toward the ups ide, but I believe they are som ewhat skewed to the upside at th is point. I agree with the comm ents that have be en m ade today that we have to be prepared 2/2-3/99 124 to move very quickly w hen we see som e evidence of inflation in the pipeline. It doesn’t have to be in the actual num bers, but we have to be sure that we see som e evidence. Clearly, we have not seen any eviden ce in recent years. So, I support your recomm endation a t this tim e. But we have to be very, very vigilant.

MR. BERNARD. This language begins  at the bottom  of page 23 of the Bluebook: “To prom ote the Comm ittee’s long -run objectives of pr ice stability and sustain able econom ic growth, the Comm ittee in the imm ediate future s eeks condition s in reserve m arkets consistent with  maintaining the f ederal funds rate at an average of around 4¾ percent. In view of the evidence curre ntly av ailab le, the Comm ittee believ es that prospective developm ents are equally likely to  warrant an in crease o r a decreas e in th e federal funds rate operating objec tive during the interm eeting period.”

MR. GRAM LICH. I have just one questi on on som ething Don Kohn said earlier. Next m eeting we will be under the n ew regim e where if som e significant change in  the Comm ittee’s consensus develops, in the sense that  we talked about at the last m eeting, we would announce that in the afternoon. Is that right? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. If it invo lves a sign ificant shif t in the Comm ittee’s cons ensus, that would have to be considered. Yes, the new regim e would be in effect. 2/2-3/99 125
