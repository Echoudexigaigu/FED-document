[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. So m ove. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection. We will turn to Peter Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I will be referring to the three As you can see in the top panel, this tim e I have added in the 6-m onth forward 3-m onth rate as a black dotted line; it should not be infected with any end-of -year Y2K prem ium, at least f or the next f ew days. You will recall that I used to include routinely the 6-m onth forward rate in all of these panels until all three of the m oney m arket yield curves becam e so compressed that they were too hard to see on the charts. Looking at the top chart on the U.S. dollar forward rates, you can see that the upward drift in m oney m arket rate expectations began in m id-to-late January and was accelerated significantly by the m arket’s initial reaction to the Chairm an’s Hum phrey-Hawkins testim ony. These heightened expectations began to unwind rather quickly over subsequent days, however, as data cam e out indicating an absence of price pressures and com ments by m embers of the Com mittee suggested an absence of urgency for a m onetary policy m ove. But even ignoring the peaks of late 3-month rate and the 6-m onth forward 3-m onth rate are alm ost 40 basis points higher today than they were in m id-January. In particular, I would note that the 6-m onth forward 3-m onth rate, the black line, has been trading for the last few days at a prem ium of about 15 to 20 basis points over the current 3-m onth rate. And that is the widest spread between that forward rate and the current rate since the June-July 1997 period. The m iddle chart depicts the Germ an m ark and euro forward rates. It is intriguing to see, even with an eventual further ease by the ECB being widely discussed, the extent to which those forward rates m oved up in late rates. In the bottom  chart, on the Japanese forward rates, I would suggest that the spread shown there between the 9-m onth forward and the current 1 / A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Fisher is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 1) 3/30/99 2 rates probably reflects a Y2K prem ium and should be interpreted that way and not as the anticipation of a significant upward m ovem ent in Japanese rates. Turning to the second page, let m e go over som e yield and spread relationships. In the top panel you can see yields on selected 10-year governm ent bonds for the United States, the United Kingdom , Italy, and Germ any and for the 10-year U.S. inflation-indexed security. A very simple point to note in this panel is that during the period from  October through Decem ber som e rather dram atic changes in the relationships among m ajor G-5 governm ent bond yields em erged, and those changes occurred abruptly. But from  January forward--dating roughly from  the tim e of the real float on January 15th--you can see that these bond yields began to march in parallel, giving the m arket a rather strong sense that U.K. and continental governm ent bond m arkets are following the lead of the U.S. Treasury m arket. The m iddle panel shows a series of spread relationships over the on-the-run Treasuries. In the top orange line, you can see that there was a narrowing in the m ortgage-backed spread as long-term  rates backed up in this country, reflecting a reduction in the prepaym ent risk for the m ortgage-backed portfolios. It is interesting that the other spread relationships have remained rather constant, notwithstanding the backup in the U.S. Treasury yield curve and the rather heavy issuance of  securities in the f ixed-incom e incom e markets with the current spread relationships. On the other hand, the bottom  red line, the twice of f-the-run U.S. Treasuries, shows that while this spread has narrowed a little to around 15 basis points, or roughly half its October peak of  30 basis points, it is still 3 tim es its pre-Russian-crisis norm  of around 5 basis points. So, while there has been som e unwinding of anxiety in that area, there still is a rather pronounced desire for liquidity in fixed-incom e markets; m arket participants seem  anxious to hold instrum ents that they can sell quickly if they want to. In the bottom  panel, you can see that both Mexican and Argentine Brady spreads have returned to, or just past, their pre-Russian-crisis levels. And the Brazilian bond is now trading at a spread against Treasuries that prevailed in Decem ber of last year, before the intensification of the problem s in Brazil. Turning to dom estic open m arket operations, page 3 has a scatter plot similar to one I have shown you before in which each dot represents a day. The horizontal axis shows the divergence of each day’s effective funds rate from the target rate. And the vertical axis depicts a m easure of  volatility 3/30/99 3 expressed by the num ber of basis points contained within one standard deviation of trading around the effective rate. The blue dots on the chart cover the period from  Septem ber 30th of last year through February 3rd and the red dots cover the days since your last m eeting. Eyeing the chart, you can see that the red dots are giving us a rather better cluster around the target rate, showing a tendency toward lower volatility than we experienced in the rather dif ficult period f rom the end of panel with a m ore precise m easure of this to give you a sense of how the funds m arket is calm ing down. That panel shows the m edian value of the daily divergence of the effective rate from  the target rate regardless of sign and the m edian value of the daily standard deviation. Looking at the first line, in 1997 there were as m any days on which the effective rate diverged from  the target by less than 7 basis points as there where days on which it diverged from  the target by m ore than 7 basis points. Similarly, on roughly half the days the standard deviation was less than 9 basis points and on roughly half the days it was m ore than 9 basis points. As you can see, those values were m ore or less m aintained through m uch of 1998 until the end of Septem ber. After that we experienced a rather significant period of volatility, when roughly half the days had an absolute deviation from  the target of  more than 15 basis points and a volatility standard deviation of more than 24 basis points. But, as seen in the red line covering the period since the last FOMC m eeting, the values have returned to m ore norm al levels. Looking back, I think it is quite clear that in the fourth quarter of last year we faced a very anxious funds m arket, with elevated and erratic demand for excess reserves leading to volatility and f irm rates. To be candid, in January we on the Desk probably were slower to reduce our anxiety than the m arket; we were just a little behind the m arket in unwinding those anxieties and we were probably tending to be a bit generous in the provision of reserves. But that effect was overwhelm ed by the generosity that the weather-induced float provided, giving us som e rather volatile and squishy-sof t days in January. But we seem  to have come through that, and in the last interm eeting period the funds m arket appears to have returned to m uch m ore m uted and norm al conditions. Let m e conclude by noting that starting this com ing Monday we will be m oving our routine operating tim e to around 9:30 a.m ., one hour earlier than has been our practice. I want to thank the staffs of the Board and the Reserve Banks as well as the Treasury for their efforts to provide data on reserves to us m ore quickly so we can do this and participate in the m arket when it is a little m ore deep and liquid than later in the day. 3/30/99 4 We had no foreign exchange intervention operations to report. We concluded the foreign currency rebalancing that the Com mittee authorized, which we will report on in f ull in the written quarterly report we will be sending you during the m onth of April. I will need the Com mittee’s ratification of our dom estic operations. I will be happy to answer any questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for Peter? 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I have a quick question regarding the on-the-run and off-the-run Treasuries. Could you rem ind m e what the norm al relationship has been over the last 20 years or so? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I have data going back about 15 years, and the difference has been around 5 or 6 basis points. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I just wanted to be sure that the less than 7 basis points you were talking about is not the anom aly against the norm . 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. No, it is not. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. The Septem ber 30 through January relationship is the anom aly. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, the 5, 6, 7 basis point difference was the long-term  trend for m any, m any years. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Peter, what has been happening to the bid/asked spreads of both on-the-run and off-the-run forward Treasuries? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I don’t have that on the tip of m y tongue. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Peter, your staff provided m e som e inform ation on that; let m e see if I can rem ember it. The on-the-run bid/asked spreads are back to norm al levels. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If you are trying to em barrass Peter, you are succeeding! 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. No em barrassm ent as long as m y staff gets the credit! 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. The on-the-run spreads are back to typical levels in all sectors of the m arket--in bills and both short and long coupon issues. The off-the-run spreads have 3/30/99 5 come down a lot, but they are not back to where they were before the Russian crisis. They are close, but not quite there. They’re still a little wider. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further questions for Peter? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I move approval of the dom estic operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Without objection. We will m ove now to Mike Prell and Karen Johnson. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. For the benefit of those of you who didn' t get your fill of basketball cliches over the last few days, I perhaps should characterize the U.S. econom y as continuing to hit “nothin’ but net”--rapid expansion and low inflation. In any event, as you know, GDP cam e in even higher in the fourth quarter than we anticipated at the last m eeting, and we’ve now raised our sights on first-quarter growth the better part of a percentage point, to about 3½ percent. Meanwhile, recent readings on wages and prices have been even m ore benign than we expected. Under the circum stances, I guess I’m  obliged to explain why we won’t just get with the new era program  and sim ply extrapolate the good news--rather than predicting, once again, that the econom y will decelerate appreciably and that inflation will pick up. I’ll be brief, just em phasizing a few key points in the Greenbook. Our basic thesis is still that dom estic dem and growth will slow enough over the next several quarters to m ore than offset a lessening drag from  the external sector. The two key elem ents in that story are by now familiar--indeed, in danger of becom ing quite shopworn. The first is that the stocks of consum er durables, houses, and business equipm ent are already growing so rapidly that, absent som e deceleration, they’ll get way out of whack with longer-term  incom e and output trends. The second elem ent is that if share prices continue rising at anything approaching the pace of the past several years, they’ll get way out of whack with profit trends. Of course, there can be an interaction between the two elem ents--a virtuous cycle up to a point, but one that can carry too far on the basis of unrealistic expectations. So, what are the m ost recent signals as to whether we are on the verge of som e moderation? Frankly, on the face of it, there aren’t m any signs of slowing as far as household and business investm ent is concerned. Real expenditures for consum er durables appear to be headed for about a 12 percent annualized gain in the first quarter; residential investm ent appears 3/30/99 6 to be headed for about a 12 percent gain; and business equipm ent outlays appear to be headed for--you guessed it--about a 12 percent gain. But, let m e try to put a little spin on these num bers. In the case of business equipm ent spending, our guess for the first-quarter growth rate is off considerably from  the 17 percent increase last year, and the recent orders data and other indicators suggest further m oderation ahead. Meanwhile, for both consum er durables and residential investm ent, one can point to special factors that have boosted activity of late and that m ight reasonably be expected to prove transitory. One of these is the intense com petition am ong autom akers sparked by GM’s effort to regain m arket share. The com panies are m aking enough money on light trucks that they probably can afford to continue this competition f or som e time, but it seem s unlikely that they would escalate the pricing battle enough to push sales above the recent elevated pace-­especially given their capacity constraints. More likely, with som e dem and having already been pulled f orward by incentive program s, sales will f all this spring. Another special factor is the m ortgage-refinancing wave, which is now receding. Pinning down the effects of refinancings on spending hasn’t proven an easy thing to do, but intuition, anecdote, and som e statistical work suggest that dem and has received an extra boost from  refinancings stimulated by lower interest rates last f all. Finally, the further run-up in housing starts in recent m onths likely has reflected the efforts of builders to satisfy the backlog of orders that built up with the surge in dem and last year--ef forts aided by a m ild winter. Going forward, tight supplies of construction workers could m ake it difficult to achieve, from  where we have been of late, the norm al seasonal pickup in activity. But builders m ay not even want to try, given the recent hints of peaking dem and for hom es. Consequently, we are projecting a substantial negative swing in residential investm ent over the next couple of quarters. Of course, other com ponents of household dem and conceivably could pick up the slack, if the fundam entals of incom e and wealth are still favorable. This is where the stock m arket com es in. With som e trepidation, we stuck with our assessm ent that the bull m arket has pretty much run its course. We were encouraged in this regard by the nervousness that has been expressed by m arket analysts about high valuations and earnings prospects. Time will tell whether the enthusiasm of breaking the Dow 10,000 barrier will override those concerns. As the 3/30/99 7 simulations in the Greenbook indicate, though, it probably would take quite large further increases in share prices to totally underm ine our forecast of demand deceleration. It could happen, but it is far from  a certainty. This brings m e, in a way, to the supply side of the picture and the inflation outlook. The bull m arket m ight be said to need a continuation of low inflation--and thus no greater threat of substantial Fed tightening--and strong productivity growth to extend the recent uptick in profits. We’ve becom e more optim istic on both these scores, but not enough to transform the picture and lay out a really upbeat scenario. Labor productivity increases in the fourth quarter and, on our estim ate, in the first quarter have been im pressive. Looking at how the various relationships in the econom y fit together in light of those readings-­and recognizing that we could be m aking a m ole hill of a pebble--we’ve tacked on a tenth of a percent per year to our assessm ent of the average pace of structural im provem ent in productivity since 1995. In addition, considering what seem s to be going on with respect to investm ent and the apparent unceasing drive for efficiency, we’ve extrapolated that sm all increm ent through 2000. The cum ulative effects of this slight change in trend productivity are great enough to offset m ost of the effect of our higher GDP path on the prospective level of the unem ploym ent rate and also to ease som ewhat the apparent squeeze on the m arkup of prices over trend unit labor costs. Consequently, we’ve been able to carry the recent good news on inflation through in the forecast. Owing to the backup in oil prices, however, the picture is still one of a noticeable rise in headline inflation over the com ing months. By this sum mer, we’ll probably be looking at year-on-year CPI increm ents in the 2s, once again. It is, of course, arguable that the latest productivity num bers are a sign that we’re entering a period of even better perform ance than we’ve anticipated. If so, that’s clearly a good thing. But, if it m eans that the demand for capital goods is stronger, it could reinforce the assessm ent in our baseline forecast that interest rates probably will have to be raised at some point to m aintain econom ic stability. Karen will now offer an update on som e of the key external influences in the outlook. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. The basic picture from  the external sector is very similar to that in the January Greenbook. We expect net exports to continue to be a drag on GDP growth, but to a dim inishing extent going 3/30/99 8 forward. In the very near term , exports are a negative factor as som e elem ents that boosted exports strongly in the fourth quarter of last year are unwound. That com bined with the upward revision to U.S. activity and thus to im port growth results in a m ore sizable drop in net exports for the first half of this year than we expected in January. Exports should rebound in the second half of this year and grow m oderately next year, even after we take into account the som ewhat stronger level of the dollar that we now see as likely. Two developm ents in particular since January inspire som e confidence in our positive view toward the prospects for exports. One is the m ove in Japan to significantly m ore aggressive m onetary ease, coupled with signs that financial sector reform  is proceeding. Although we continue to have activity weakening in Japan through the m iddle of next year, we now are looking for an upturn to begin during the second half of 2000. Financial m arket participants seem  to have applauded the latest policy m oves in Japan m ore than we would, and am ple downside risks remain there. Nevertheless, there are reasons to see developm ents in Japan over the past two m onths as m ovem ents in a positive direction. Recent developm ents in Brazil have also lent credence to the view that m eltdown can be avoided in Brazil and, therefore, that the risk of contagion to its neighbors is lim ited. As a consequence, we have revised slightly upward our outlook for Mexico. The Brazilian real has retraced some of its decline in term s of the do llar, even in the face of a reduction in the overnight interest rate by the central bank of Brazil. Thus far, support among Brazil’s bank creditors is holding up, and last week one Brazilian bank was able to return to the global m arket and raise voluntary funds with a one-year m aturity. The reform  program  still faces m any hurdles, and success is not assured, but events in the past several weeks have been encouraging. There are still places in the world where new econom ic crises could erupt. We have seen one such case in Ecuador, but so far it seem s contained, with no signs of further contagion. A potentially m ore serious case is China, where m ajor dom estic problem s would no doubt have greater implications for its neighbors. We see real output growth slowing this year in China and have built into the forecast a gradual m ove in its exchange rate next year. A more severe deceleration, or a m ore abrupt change in the exchange rate, would threaten the signs of recovery now evident in the developing countries of Asia and coul d risk another round of financial and real m acroeconom ic turm oil in em erging m arkets. Finally, there is now the possibility of the events in Kosovo triggering som e financial m arket reaction or underm ining consum er or business confidence sufficiently to 3/30/99 9 affect econom ic activity, particularly in Europe. At the m oment, any econom ic consequences seem  very lim ited, but further escalation of the conflict could change that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for either? 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. I have a question for Karen. You are projecting a further deterioration in the trade balance currently and in the near-term  future, but the projection for the dollar shows it fairly steady or actually increasing a bit. I know that last year we had a worsening trade deficit and the dollar actually appreciated, but there was a huge inflow of  capital as a result of  the f light-to-quality m ovem ents, which I would im agine we are not expecting this year. So, I am  wondering how confident you are that the dollar will hold up, given this situation going forward. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. The com prom ise forecast of a basically flat nom inal dollar-­or an upward tilt in the real dollar, which is what m atters in the forecast--com es about prim arily because U.S. inflation is projected to be slightly higher than the very, very low inflation we expect to see in m ost other industrial countries. So in som e sense, we are forecasting a generally flat nom inal dollar as the offset of forces whose size we can’t really project. Theref ore, the notion that the dollar will likely be f lat is som ewhat of  an agnostic forecast rather than one in which we have great confidence. On the one hand, we see the European and Japanese econom ies as still quite weak. We expect m onetary conditions in Europe to be eased at som e point and we expect Japanese m onetary conditions to rem ain very, very aggressively easy. The sense that the U.S. econom y has experienced positive surprises that are not going to end abruptly vis-à-vis the m onetary easing that we expect abroad m ight actually have led us to forecast an appreciation in the dollar. What stopped us from  moving that far is our concern about the ongoing widening of the extern al balances. So we have put together those f actors--one likely having positive ef fects and one likely having negative ef fects-­and have tried to com e up with a neutral com prom ise by positing a flat nom inal dollar and a rising real dollar. In fact, we even have the euro com ing back up som e on the grounds that weakness in Europe is not so pronounced and that our external deficits will becom e a more im portant factor. 3/30/99 10 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mike, I have a question about real wages. With the forecast that you have for the ECI and the core CPI, real wages are up about 1¼ percent in 1999 and about 1 percent in the year 2000. I know that represents a continuation of the pattern that seem s to have existed at least since 1992 in term s of the Greenbook num bers. But it seem s perplexing given the fact that you have productivity, one assum es, growing at an average rate of 1.9 percent and also very tight labor m arket conditions. In such a case one would norm ally expect the growth rate of real wages to be in excess of 2 percent. Do you have any ideas about what is happening and how realistic that forecast m ight be for the next two years? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Well, our forecast for real com pensation in term s of the employm ent cost index is greater than 2 percent over 1999-2000 when m easured against product prices--for exam ple, nonfarm  business prices. And I think that is the m ore appropriate m etric to look at in this context. It is m ore consistent with thinking about the shares going to labor and to capital. It also m akes m ore sense of what we saw in 1998 when we had not only a tight but a tightening labor m arket. So, that is what we have been focusing on and I think our forecast m akes reasonable sense in that regard. There are still questions, too, about what the nom inal wage m ight do and I think we tried to be quite clear--for exam ple, in the Chart Show last tim e--about the uncertainties that surround that aspect of the forecast and the different m odels one can apply. But in term s of real wages, I think we have fairly sensible num bers. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. I want to ask som ething that doesn’t really have an answer. But I’d like to get your views from  the dom estic and international side in trying to tie together som e thoughts and observations about the U.S. econom y and the rest of the world and which is m ore likely to change and why. Looking back on 1998, for the U.S. econom y everything was, if anything, better than expected in term s of output, employm ent, inflation, and other m easures we talk about. Looking at the rest of the world, econom ic perform ance was, if anything, worse than hoped for or expected. In our 3/30/99 11 efforts to understand the U.S. econom y, we use words like technology, innovation, and various business efficiencies to try to explain its extraordinary perform ance. Then, in thinking about what is going on in the rest of the world, at least in the non-English-speaking world, it is tem pting to think that technology, efficiencies, and so on do still recognize borders, which is probably not likely. So if it is not a uniquely Am erican phenom enon or even a phenom enon of English-speaking countries, as som e people m ight argue, what is likely to change?  Also, on Al Broaddus’s question about the exchange rate, I don’t know to what extent we ought to be thinking that it is a pull phenom enon-­where everything is wonderful here, which allows the capital inflow and a worsening of the current account deficit and yet we don’t have a problem . Or how m uch of it is push? If everything is so bad every place else, when are they going to get their act together and figure out what we are doing right?  That w ould help us understand at what point this large and growing current account deficit and external debt will becom e a problem  for us. Will it be either when we stop doing things so perf ectly or when the rest of  the world starts doing things a lot better?  Any com ments or observations? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I have posed the essence of your question to a lot of people. The question I have pondered is: If technology, productivity, com puters, internets, or whatever are the fundam ental explanation for why the U.S. perform ance has been better-­not just for 1998 but for about the past three years--why is it that we don’t see it elsewhere? One m ight expect to see it especially, say, in Canada, where we see it a little but not a lot. We actually are looking into how m uch of it is apparent in Canada. When I ask this question of Europeans, I get answer s that have a lot to do with the well-known structural problem s that beset the European econom y, but I also som etimes hear surprisingly optim istic accounts that at the m icro level people are beginning to see a change. I have even had sim ilar accounts about Japan from  people who have been to that country recently and to whom  I have posed this question. My contacts say they have heard stories from  people they talked to last week or last m onth that suggest that at individual firm s and in selected industries this phenom enon is beginning to m ake its way into the econom ies of Europe and Japan. That 3/30/99 12 makes som e sense in that we know from  studies of past m ajor innovations--the introduction of electricity to replace steam , for exam ple--that the actual econom ic im pact came long after the invention. It took a very long tim e for people to figure out how to do things differently and how to exploit the pa rticular advantages of the new technology as opposed to just m imicking the old technology. Given the structural problem s in Europe and the degree to which risk-taking and m obility are lim ited there, it is not im plausible that it would take longer in Europe than it m ight take in the United States. I honestly don’t know how m uch credence to put in the stories that, in fact, there is som ething bubbling under the surface and that a global technology event really will becom e visible. But it is at least a little reassuring that, in som e micro-type anecdotes, there is an echo of what we see in the United States that suggests there is hope for Europe. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Let m e touch briefly on another aspect of your question. There is a school of thought--John Makin com es to m ind, for exam ple--arguing recently that an improvem ent in the econom ies of Japan and som e other Asian countries will have negative ef fects f or the United States. The view is that dem and abroad will reduce the supply of savings--which as you indicated has been flowing readily into the United States because we appear to be a safe haven or an area with fast im proving technology--and that will exert general upward pressure on interest rates, which will be dam aging. It is rather hard for m e to get m y arm s around the thought that better econom ic perform ance in the rest of the world is a detrim ent to the United States. But I suppose when one thinks about 1998 and the shocks that we’ve had and the bene ficial effects in our financial m arkets, the argum ent is that the accom modation that in a sense the Fed provided actually added to aggregate dem and and pushed the unem ploym ent rate perhaps below sustainable levels. There m ight be som ething to the view that we have to give that back at som e point if we have overshot sustainable levels of resource utilization. That is another version of the worry about the reversal of the “supply shocks” that we have been experiencing and how we m ight have to cope with that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan. 3/30/99 13 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Mike, in the introduction to your com ments you im plied that the forecast does not reflect in som e way a belief in the “new econom y.” But over the last three or four years I have seen your trend rate of productivity growth first go down to less than 1 percent--say, to about 0.7 to 0.9 percent--and then just about double to where it is now. Two questions: If you were a believer in the “new econom y,” how high would that num ber be?  [Laughter] And second, if in fact productivity growth had been a little more stable than that and what we are seeing is really m ore cyclical, how sensitive is the timing of the inflation increase in your forecast?  Could inflation actually rise by ½ percentage point later this year? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I’m sorry, I’m  not sure I caught the last part of your question. I was thinking about answering the first part and I lost the thread on the last part. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Sorry. The second part of the question is: If you were to take a trend productivity num ber that was slightly less than the one you have now--let’s say 1.7 percent--how sensitive is your inflation forecast in term s of the tim ing?  You have inflation up by about ½ percentage point or som ething like that by the end of 2000. With a lower productivity num ber would that increase actually occur a lot sooner? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. The latter question is extrem ely difficult to answer, as is the first one. There are questions of definitions here. What do we m ean by “new econom y” or “new era” and so on?  I don’t think that’s easy to pin down. In many accounts it is something that rejects all the known rules of econom ic behavior, or what we thought were known rules. In other views, as I suggested in a briefing som e time back, it m ay be that what we need isn’t necessarily a new paradigm  but sim ply som e new param eters. We know that productivity historically has not grown at the sam e rate in all eras. We know that the com position of the workforce and other factors can affect the natural rate of unem ploym ent. So we are always in search of what the current values of those param eters are. As we have gained experience with how the econom y is operating, what we have been trying to do is to put those num bers into better alignm ent with the facts. And that is what we have been doing over the past few years as we have seen better productivity perform ance than we thought could be reconciled with a continuation of the 3/30/99 14 weak trend we had seen in the post-1973 era. W e could also see that investm ent was at a very high level, producing considerable capital deepening. That em boldened us to m ove apart from  most of the pack and raise our estim ates of productivity trend. And as we looked at the experience of the past year or so in our latest forecast round--and we looked at all the various behavioral relations in the econom y--we once again thought that edging up that productivity trend estim ate a bit further was warranted. If we were to go to the new era concept, I think we would probably start by saying that resource utilization levels have absolutely no influence on inflation. That seem s to be one of the tenets. It is not clear what does determ ine the rate of inflation in this new paradigm , but the new era tenet certainly seem s to be rejected by m ost people. And it is not part of our forecast; we haven’t incorporated that. We basically just jiggled the param eters of a fairly conventional m odel. Now, if we had knocked a couple of tenths off the productivity trend, the effects would depend on where we started and whether we sensed that trend was perceived by people in the real world or not. I guess I’d have to say that the outlook for inflation, if we reached back a couple of years and changed this productivity trend, would deteriorate fairly rapidly relative to our baseline. To the extent that we give any weight to the m arkup over trend unit labor cost, which is a fairly conventional m odel of price determ ination--and I m ust say we don’t give it the preponderance of weight--we would find that the m arkup was being squeezed considerably over the past few years with a 1.7 percent productivity trend. And that would have negative im plications going forward, especially in the tight m arkets that we have; firm s would be trying to restore their terms of the dif ferences but, given that we already have an upward tilt, it would perhaps make a m aterial difference in our perception of the upturn in inflation.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I have a labor m arket question. We know that the labor m arket in the aggregate has done very, very well. We expected solid perform ance and it has come in better than expected. The participation rate has gone to postwar highs, I believe. 3/30/99 15 At the sam e time, we know that m anufacturing em ploym ent has been on the weak side; that is related in good part to the problem s in Asia. My question is this: Do we know anything about the laid-off workers in m anufacturing or perhaps even som ething about physical capacity in m anufacturing?  Have these workers been absorbed perm anently or on som e sort of long-run basis elsewhere in the econom y? Or are a lot of people sitting around unem ployed so that the aggregate num bers reflect other people who have com e into the labor force?  What will happen when dem and for m anufacturing, because of eventual Asian recovery, com es back? Will these resources com e back into manufacturing in the United States?  Or do we have steel capacity that is perm anently shut down and workers that have been dispersed to other industries?  Do you have any feel for that? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Not as m uch as we’d like. We’ve actually been thinking about exam ining the data on som e aspects of that. One assertion that has been m ade is that wages are being held down because m anufacturing has been weak and thus manufacturing wages haven’t been rising, and that m ight be a sort of pattern-setting elem ent in the picture. We don’t find any system atic relationship over tim e in that regard. It is an interesting hypothesis but not one for which we have been able to find confirm ation in the data. It is possible to look at the m ovem ents of workers. One question I raised was whether this trend in m anufacturing em ploym ent could be providing som e relief in the construction industry. People who could not get jobs on assem bly lines or had lost jobs on assem bly lines m ight be f illing the gap there. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Similar skills are involved. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Well, they are not always sim ilar; the skilled construction worker has special skills that som eone who has worked at a steel plant doesn’t necessarily have. But in term s of the opportunities available, a relatively low skilled construction job m ight be attractive as opposed to working at McDonalds. At this point we have looked at this hypothesis in only a lim ited way and we haven’t found m uch confirm ation of it--statistical or anecdotal. 3/30/99 16 I’m really not sure precisely what has happened on unem ploym ent in manufacturing; I don’t have the data in front of m e. Those are shaky num bers because the survey asks what a person’s last job was, and a laid-off m anufacturing worker could have been em ployed elsewhere after he lost his m anufacturing job. Those data would be one place to look, and perhaps I should, to see if there is evidence that idled manufacturing workers are still lingering out there am ong the unem ployed. My suspicion is that the decline in m anufacturing em ploym ent hasn’t been going on long enough that these people have totally abandoned their hopes of getting another m anufacturing job. Unfortunately, in our forecast m anufacturing does not grow rapidly enough to generate any increases in em ploym ent. While trade is im proving, we really are going to be generating little, if any, additional em ploym ent in m anufacturing over the forecast period. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who would like to start the Com mittee discussion?  President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. The econom y in the Eleventh District appears to be maintaining its overall health and positive growth trend. Recent revisions to Texas employm ent data suggest that Texas em ploym ent grew 2½ percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year, which is a bit higher than indicated in the original numbers. The data also show that em ploym ent was growing at a rate of around 3½ percent during the first two m onths of this year. Signs of stabilization in som e Asian econom ies and a rebounding of prospects in Mexico have turned around the export picture for the Texas econom y, boosting the electronics industry in particular. Total exports from  Texas grew m odestly in the fourth quarter after falling for the first three quarters of 1998. The electronics industry in Texas experienced em ploym ent gains in demand and above average com puter replacem ent dem ands stem ming from  Y2K, we have seen a m arked increase in chip sales. This has been accom panied by increases in DRAM prices of over 20 percent as inventories have declined. Oil prices have increased about 20 percent over the last couple of weeks, following the OPEC agreem ent to cut output; the perm anency of  this increase is 3/30/99 17 debatable, but it m ay slow som e of the hem orrhaging in the Eleventh District energy industry. Our directors still believe that the problem s in the oil and gas industry are structural in nature and that the trend in oil prices is m ore likely down than up. They also believe that OPEC is no m ore likely to hold down output this tim e than it did the last several tim es. Characteristic of the pessim ism in the energy industry was a rem ark made by one of  the m embers of  our Sm all Business and Agricultural Advisory Com mittee last week. He said that he was just as likely to see a working oil rig in the Texas panhandle as he was to see a dinosaur crossing the road. [Laughter] I also learned in that m eeting that f or a lot of  the operators of  small oil wells, the price they actually get at the wellhead is significantly below the benchm ark of W est Texas Interm ediate. Construction activity rem ains strong, but signs are beginning to em erge that activity is at or near a peak. Contract values have already edged down. In Dallas, builders com pleted 6,000 m ore apartm ents than they leased in 1998. In Houston, the supply of apartm ents expected to be brought on stream  this year is generally thought to be excessive unless the energy industry turns around. A year ago I was reporting commercial and office rent increases of 20 to 30 percent but, as expected, m arket signals worked and now the com pletions of new office space have begun to outpace new leasing activities. Office rent concessions of  up to 4 m onths have already been reported in Dallas and Houston early this year. The abundance of real estate capacity should reduce inflationary pressures in that sector. Low capacity utilization levels in m anufacturing prom ise to do the sam e. As for agriculture, the outlook for a continuation of weak com modity prices is remain tight in m ost of our large urban areas, wage increases have been in line with national productivity trends. That allows m e to be com fortable with the Greenbook forecast, which does not see wage acceleration as a source of inflationary pressures. At the national level, a long period has elapsed since our last m eeting, so we have had two com plete rounds of statistical reports and they show m ostly m ore of the 3/30/99 18 same. Output and em ploym ent growth rem ain strong and unem ploym ent continues favorable. Contem porary m easures of inflation rem ain flat. The CPI rose 0.1 percent in both January and February; inflation in the pipeline and leading indicators of inflation continue to be favorable; and m ost com modity price indexes are down further. The dollar is som ewhat stronger. Capacity utilization rem ains low in the United States and is even lower globally. Oil prices are the exception, although in m y part of the country it is dangerous to com plain about the rebound in oil prices. In any case, m oney growth has slowed, which is good news everywhere.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Econom ic activity continues unabated in New England. Labor m arkets continue to be tight, with the unem ploym ent rate for the region m ore than a percentage point below that of the nation. Employm ent growth continues above trend for the region, but it is still below that for the nation. Research done at the Bank attributes this lower level of job growth to a lack of labor supply. This is confirm ed by anecdotal reports in which alm ost every type of worker is said to be hard to find. However, except for high-tech workers, wage increases are in the 3 to 6 percent range, depending on the industry. In addition, growth in the Boston area’s CPI seem s to have m oderated. It had been rising faster than the nation as a whole but it now appears to be m atching the national experience. Staff at the Bank spent som e time since the last FOMC m eeting talking with temporary help firm s in New England in an effort to understand their perspectives on local and national labor m arkets. The five firm s contacted reported strong dem and and difficult supply conditions; that is, their clients were requesting additional em ployees and workers were very hard to com e by. Nonetheless, firm s reported increases both in workers on assignm ent and revenues, with wages rising steadily. Three of the five firm s noted that they are unable to increase client charges as m uch as wages, so profits are being squeezed. The tone of these conversations was m uch m ore upbeat than when the last contacts were m ade in Novem ber. Several of the firm s contacted act both as recruiters for perm anent staff and as suppliers of tem porary help. They report that the 3/30/99 19 mix of assignm ents is shifting toward perm anent positions. Early in the recovery, temporary help seem ed cheaper and labor was m ore plentiful. Now it has becom e more difficult and expensive to find tem porary workers and to deal with the inevitable issues of high turnover and training costs. Real estate m arkets rem ain strong. Residential construction surged in dipped a bit and price increases m oderated, at least as reflected in regional data. Anecdotally, however, house prices are said to be rising rapidly in the Boston m etro area. And we could use a few of the apartm ents that they are building in Dallas! Com mercial real estate supplies have expanded a bit with the addition of som e new space, and vacancy rates in Boston have leveled out, albeit at very low num bers. As I have noted before, there is not a lot of speculative building going on; credit m arket conditions over the past year have not m ade financing speculative new projects very easy. Thus, the business of  com mercial real estate rem ains “v ery sweet” in the words of one contact, with strong dem and and high rents. One item  of local interest relates to the continuing decline in m anufacturing jobs in the region. Manufacturing jobs appeared to be on the rise m arginally in early 1998 but now are declining faster than for the nation as a whole. This captures the attention of local people who, despite very low unem ploym ent rates, see this as a negative trend. Growth in construction jobs, albeit from  a low base, and in retail trade and services has m ore than absorbed the decline in m anufacturing jobs. However, m any do not see service jobs in particular as the equivalent of those in m anufacturing. This is a topic that has engaged local labor leaders and politicians, especially considering that tax breaks granted over the past two to three years were directed at m anufacturing firm s and were given in the expectation of keeping jobs in the states of the region. Credit m arket conditions continue to be regarded as favorable, with spreads wider than a year ago but funding readily available. Local lending growth has declined since last fall, in line with national trends. I spent som e time recently with two partners of local venture capital firms, one specializing in high-tech start-ups and the other in larger firm s in the 3/30/99 20 entertainm ent and m edia areas. They both noted that deals were being m ade at extrem ely rich prices and that new entrants into their businesses were winning deals based on offers that to these two contacts seem ed nonsensical. In the words of one, “This is a tim e for selling, not buying.” A form er Bank director a nd partner in another very large venture capital firm  corroborated these accounts and noted that his firm  is com pletely out of the investm ent com munity with whom  I meet regularly echoed this cautionary tone. They all view econom ic conditions and financial m arkets as frothy, bordering on excessive. Their sense was one of tim es being too good and a concern about what will happen when the party stops. Certainly, the fact that we were m eeting as the bom bing in Kosovo was intensifying did not help this sense of foreboding. On the national scene, our forecast is not terribly different from  the Greenbook’s on the growth side. However, we see a bit m ore stable trend rate of productivity growth and thus a decline in the unem ploym ent rate to a little less than 4 percent--3.9 percent in 1999 Q4. We also see inflation rising earlier than does the Greenbook, though, as I’ve said before, we have to be hum ble about any projection on that front. I am puzzled by the m oderation in wage inflation in the last couple of m onths and confounded by the strength I see everywhere except in pricing power. Downside risks on the international side seem  to have m oderated considerably and we, like the Greenbook, have a slightly higher external growth forecast than we did in January. However, we do continue to see a drag on gr owth of about ½ percentage point or m aybe a little greater than that from  the external deficit in 1999 as a whole. On the other hand, considerable risk rem ains that growth will exceed current estim ates for the first half of this year, driven by consum er spending on houses, cars, and other durable goods. The stock m arket rem ains exuberant, to say the least; credit is plentiful; and the boom  in interest-sensitive sectors suggests that the cost of capital is too low. It is true that inflation is also quite low, and therein lies the issue. The exuberance of the econom y may well com e back to haunt us, even if inflation does not take off in the 3/30/99 21 near term . To paraphrase W illiam  McChesney Martin: The party seem s to be in progress and the question now is, “W hen can the punch bowl justifiably be taken away? ” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, the econom y in our District continues to perform  quite solidly. Employm ent growth in February was a bit flat, but we think that and construction are both very strong in our m etropolitan areas, and our surveys show a very high level of consum er confidence. Manufacturing activity, as in other areas, has cooled of f a little, and the num ber of  manufacturing jobs in the District f ell a bit in since 1992. Energy activity declined in January and, of course, people on the producing side have hopes--from  their vantage point--for the oil price increases that they see stem ming from  the OPEC discussions. The Di strict labor m arkets rem ain very tight, even with the weakness I talked about in m anufacturing, and we have seen in our surveys a slight uptick in wage pressures. District labor m arkets now have an unem ploym ent rate of about 3.3 percent, and that actually m ay understate the real decline slightly because we have a very high participation rate, well above the national average. The other area of som e weakness, obviously, is the agricultural sector. That sector continues to struggle with good supplies and a falloff in dem and, especially from Asia. And we are hearing m ore and m ore discussion about whether a farm  aid package will be needed again in 1999 as in 1998. As for how that will go, we’ll have to wait and see. Even with the continuing troubles in agriculture, econom ic growth in our region is strong, driven by the strength in the m etropolitan areas and even in som e of the rural areas. On the national level, our forecast is fundam entally very sim ilar to the Greenbook’s. The difficulty is that we have as m uch confidence in our forecast as Mike Prell does in the Greenbook’s. In any case, the projected strength in the econom y leaves us a bit uneasy. I want to raise again, though it m ay be a little early in the m eeting, the issue of where we were last sum mer and the actions we have taken since then as an 3/30/99 22 insurance policy. I think those easing actions were wise. But as I look back over the three years ending in 1998, we have had for m uch of that period a funds rate of about 5½ percent, steady growth, and declining inflati on. And I can’t help but continue to wonder if we should not be unwinding som e of our easing if the circum stances warrant. With that I will stop. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I am beginning to sound like a broken record, but the story for the Seventh District econom y is quite sim ilar to what I reported in the last two m eetings. Reports continue to suggest strength in consum er spending and housing activity, m ixed signals in m anufacturing, and tight labor m arkets, but few signs that inflation will accelerate in the near future. Housing rem ains robust, although there are signs that activity m ay have peaked. Strong housing m arkets continue to support consum er spending for hom e-related item s, and m ost retailers reported higher-than-expected sales, with discounters still faring better than general m erchandisers. Light vehicle sales were exceptionally strong in Fe bruary, and industry contacts indicated that sales so far in March were still running above 15½ m illion units. Earlier this m onth, the autom akers again revised up their sales forecast for this year. Manufacturing activity continues to be m ixed, but the sector overall m ay be showing som e early signs of improving. And that m ay be a little different from  som e of the other reports we have heard this m orning. The Chicago Purchasing Managers’ survey results for March, to be released tom orrow m orning, will show activity m oving higher, from  52.9 percent in paid” com ponent m oved above 50 percent for the first tim e since last April, from  41.6 percent in February to 52.5 percent in March. That inform ation, of course, should be treated confidentially until it is released tom orrow m orning. The strength in the m otor vehicle and construction industries is offsetting softness in steel and agricultural equipm ent. Heavy-duty trucks appear headed for a record year. Dem and for construction equipm ent and m aterials rem ains very strong. Construction equipm ent producers expect to benefit significantly from  the 6-year 3/30/99 23 highway funding program , and one gypsum  wallboard firm  operated at 101 percent of capacity last year by working holidays. There have been reports of wallboard being imported, which is a very rare event in our country. Price increases for wallboard have been announced and 25 percent additional capacity will be com ing on stream  over the next two years. Steel im ports have com e down sharply since Novem ber and there are signs that activity in the District steel industry m ay be bottom ing. In addition, reports indicate that steel output between now and the end of July m ay be boosted by efforts to build inventories to m eet auto industry dem and ahead of a possible strike by steelworkers. Their contract expires this sum mer. However, one of our directors who heads a m ajor steel firm  believes that a steelworkers’ strike is unlikely. And, of course, we have autom obile labor negotiations later this year as well. Farm  equipm ent m akers still expect sales and production to be down sharply this year. Com ments m ade at our Agriculture, Sm all Business, and Labor Advisory Council m eetings a couple of weeks ago echoed reports we have heard from  other contacts: That conditions in parts of the agricultural sector are bleak and that em ployers are learning to cope with tight labor m arkets. Also com plem enting the council m ember reports, a contact at a large tem porary help firm  said that wages were not going up m ore rapidly than before. Relevant to Bill Poole’s question earlier about m anufacturing workers, this contact also said that there has been som e modest pickup in the dem and for blue-collar industrial workers early this year. That has been true for several m onths now after eleven consecutive m onths of declines. He also saw som e softening in dem and for high-tech em ployees on a national basis. Turning to the national econom y, the data since our last m eeting have been surprisingly strong. Given the m omentum  that we’ve seen so far this quarter and the calm er financial conditions, we have upped our forecast for this year’s real GDP growth from  2.6 percent to around 3 percent, which is in the sam e ballpark as the Greenbook forecast. Of course, the inflation num bers also have continued to com e in quite favorably, suggesting that such high levels of econom ic activity are not currently 3/30/99 24 straining productive capabilities. Given the very heartening productivity growth we’ve seen lately, the relatively good inflation perform ance m ay well continue. Indeed, we have even lowered our core CPI forecast a bit for 1999. However, the prospect of som e upturn in inflation in 2000 from  the low rates we’ve been experiencing rem ains worrisom e. I recognize the difficulty we all have had in forecasting inflation, but all of our statistical m odels that forecast low inflation for 1999 expect core CPI inflation to accelerate noticeably next year. As econom ic growth around the world picks up over the forecast horizon, m any of the special factors re straining inflation will dissipate. Given what I still believe are substantial lags in the transm ission of  monetary policy, we need to keep in m ind the likelihood of accelerating inflation in form ulating policy over the coming m onths. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, the pace of econom ic activity in the Twelfth District has been solid in recent m onths and only a little slower than last year’s rapid pace. In the State of W ashington, the overall job count recently increased at about a 1½ percent annual rate despite the beginning of large cutbacks in the aerospace sector. Arizona also has been able to shrug off cutbacks by m ajor m anufacturers. Despite job losses in the Phoenix area, the local unem ploym ent rate is still below 3 percent. In California the econom y also is strong outsi de of m anufacturing. A pickup in state population is boosting activity in retail trade and the housing-related sectors such as construction and real estate. And state tax authorities report strong receipts from  sales taxes and personal incom e withholding in early 1999. Initial claim s for unem ploym ent insurance have rem ained low in California. With a relatively low rate of layoffs and continued strength in hiring, the state unem ploym ent rate drifted down further in the last few m onths. Tightness in the labor and housing m arkets is particularly evident in the San Francisco Bay area, where the unem ploym ent rate has rem ained below 3½ percent and housing prices have jum ped 15 percent in the past year. Turning to the national econom y, developm ents since our last m eeting have not caused us to change the tenor of our outlook for this year. We continue to think that 3/30/99 25 the m ost likely outcom e is a slowdown in real GDP growth to around 2¾ to 3 percent, with inflation in the GDP price index of 1 to 1½ percent. The slowdown of the econom y in our forecast results in part from  the waning effects of past increases in stock m arket wealth. I felt m ore confident about that assum ption when we ran the m odel than I did when I was putting this report together last evening after yesterday’s stock m arket rise! While this appears to be a reasonable forecast, there are large uncertainties. The econom y has defied expectations of a slowdown for several years, and I am  more convinced that we are seeing the effects of a favorable supply shock, perhaps related to technological developm ents, that is not being picked up by standard m odels. I believe that recent data have reinforced this view. I am referring to the evidence for the fourth quarter of even m ore rapid real GDP and pr oductivity growth and very low inflation, as well as indications for the current quarter of very low CPI inflation in com bination with moderately strong growth. I would not be at all surprised if this year’s growth once again exceeded our forecast. On the other hand, we can’t ignore other possible developm ents that could underm ine econom ic activity this year. For exam ple, growth could be seriously reduced if som e shock were to underm ine the U.S. equity m arket. However, neither of these uncertainties, from  a positive supply shock or a negative financial shock, would seem  to pose a great threat to inflation in 1999. Prospects for inflation next year, however, are more uncertain and, I believe, m ore troubling. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. For the past couple of m eetings, I have reported that the Atlanta District econom y has been on a slightly lower expansion path than the econom y as a whole. However, now it looks as if the District econom y has once again edged ahead of the nation and is expanding at a robust rate. While reports for retail sales have been m ixed, showing m ainly better sales for discounters relative to traditional departm ent stores, m anufacturi ng according to our Southeast m anufacturing survey im proved in February. Notable gains were reported in current production, employm ent, the factory workweek, and also in the outlook indicators. With regard to 3/30/99 26 the latter, capital investm ent for six m onths out surged in February. Tourism  and travel remain healthy, with substantial additions to hotel and cruise ship capacity planned. Construction prospers despite shortages in wallboard. The m ain negatives in our region are trade, agriculture, and energy; none of those negatives is surprising or new. The trade gap at our District ports over the last year rose from  $5 billion to $12 billion, alm ost six tim es the rate of deterioration nationally, as exports through those ports declined and im ports increased. Latin Am erica is in our backyard and has special im plications for our region. Because of that I would like to offer a few brief observations about Brazil, which has been given so m uch play recently. Our people spend a lot of tim e in that region and I had the benefit of paying a personal visit to Brazil since the last FOMC m eeting. I talked with a num ber of dom estic and foreign bankers and business leaders about what is going on in the Brazilian econom y. It is the case that Brazil has m ade som e progress on both the financial and the fiscal fronts. But I m ust say I cam e away with three broad im pressions that caused m e some worry. First, I sensed that the depth of  Brazil’s f iscal problem s and the political difficulties the country faces in addressing them  are m ore serious, longer term  in nature, and m ore difficult than one m ay appreciate from  reading the popular press. Second, I did not detect the broad-based sense of urgency to address those problem s that m ight have been expected. Interestingly, a num ber of  Brazilian businessm en and bankers told m e that they knew how to continue to operate profitably should Brazil return to an inflationary environm ent, and thus they could m uddle through. Finally, I found that several large U.S. com panies headquartered in m y region are m ore than a little uneasy about their investm ents in Brazil. They are uneasy because of the reneging on som e concessions, including tax f orgiveness, that were m ade by Brazilian authorities at the time those investm ent decisions were m ade. That kind of environm ent does not encourage additional investm ent. I would guess that we have not seen the end of troublesom e developm ents in Brazil. 3/30/99 27 The decline in dom estic energy production that I have reported on previously continues. As Bob McTeer indicated, ri g counts are down; Louisiana’s seasonally adjusted rig count is down to 138, the lowest level since June of 1995. To em phasize the ripple effects of this decline in energy production dom estically, the largest oil drilling service com pany notes that their benchm ark supply boat, which last year rented for $10,000 a day, is now going for $2,500 per day. Labor m arkets continue to be tight; and while there are scattered indications of wage and benefit increases, there are few new signs of overall price pressures. I might m ention a conversation I had last week with one of the largest, if not the largest, com mercial builders in the Southeast who is doing work for us. He reported that the fees they are now able to charge as a percent of the project cost have gone from 2½ to 3 percent to 3½ to 4 percent; that’s a 25 percent increase in the fees they can charge. In addition, he says they can now extract additional fees for doing up-front consulting work during the design phase. This m ay be a regional phenom enon, but given the fact that his com pany does work across m any m arkets in the Southeast, I find it interesting that he has been able to get those kinds of m argins. Two other sm aller commercial builders on our board of directors reported that they have quit bidding on jobs and will only entertain work on a negotiated basis. So, the com mercial construction sector, at least in our region, is very strong. At the national level, I continue to see som e downside risks stem ming from international developm ents, as does everyone else, despite the recent period of relative quiet and m ore settled conditions. Brazil, China, Japan, Russia, and other nations we can name are candidates for new, negative developm ents. At the sam e time, and deserving much greater weight in m y view, we have a dom estic econom y that continues to surprise us with its strength and staying power and appare nt resistance to inflation. It appears that our econom y very likely is operating beyond sustainable levels at the m oment. We have to continue to watch f or the strains and bottlenecks that m ay be associated with that. Despite the absence of a sm oking gun in the data, it is the case that our near-term inflation outlook shows som e pickup. This is due to relative price changes as 3/30/99 28 energy and com modity prices return to m ore norm al levels. More troublesom e for m e, however, are the longer-run inflation paths in the Greenbook sim ulations and our own Bank’s m odeling work. The sim ulations, as well as the charts on inflation-targeting rules contained in the m ost recent financial indicators package supplied in connection with this meeting, all im ply that a significant increase in the fed funds rate would be required to keep inflation even close to its current path. The im plication also is that the longer we wait, the higher interest rates will have to be to accom plish this task. It is hard to know whether we should take back right now at least a portion of the rate decreases we delivered last fall or whether we should wait a while longer. But it is my guess that Y2K concerns m ay make consideration of a policy shift m ore difficult as we m ove into the latter part of the year, unless the case is com pelling or we face som e very unexpected developm ents. For m e, that is another reason to be ready to m ove sooner rather than later. I find m yself leaning at this point toward at least a tilt toward tighter policy. And I would like for us to talk at least about the possibility of using our newly initiated change on disclosure of  the tilt in the directive in order to lay the groundwork for future policy m oves. This would give us m ore flexibility to m ake a policy m ove before late in the year without either surprising m arket participants or committing ourselves to a policy change if it proves not to be needed. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Conditions in our District for the m ost part m irror the robust national econom ic situation. Consum er spending rem ains very strong. Indeed, our latest service sector survey suggests that retail sales are now rising m ore rapidly than they have at any tim e in the last year. Residential construction and housing sales are extrem ely robust pretty m uch across our District. Com mercial real estate activity is less uniform ly strong, but it is very strong in certain m arkets, including the one right here. There is very little available office space in the District of Colum bia and rents are rising. 3/30/99 29 Labor m arkets rem ain very tight. In answer to Bill Poole’s question, textile companies are the m ain source of layoffs in our District, and they are laying off a lot of people. The service sector and construction com panies are going after these displaced employees and are hiring them . Of course, the textile job losses are perm anent, so what is going to happen in the long run is an open question. But the losses m ay be having some moderating effect on wages elsewhere in our econom y. In any case, wages generally in our District still seem  to be rising quite m oderately, although we hear from some of our contacts now that wage of fers are a little richer than they were a f ew months ago. Still, on the whole, final prices in our region show little upward m ovem ent. At the national level, the beat goes on. The incom ing first-quarter data, as everybody knows, suggest continuing considerable upside risk in the near-term  outlook. When one thinks about it, as we have gone through the first quarter, the changing prospects for the quarter, as they evolved, really have been extraordinary. At the tim e of the last FOMC m eeting, the Greenbook--along with just about everybody else--was forecasting about 2 percent growth in dom estic final dem and for the quarter. In the current Greenbook, that projection has been raised to close to 7 percent. I believe it is im portant that we understand as clearly as we can the reasons for this extraordinary strength in spending and its im plications. It seem s to m e that two m ain factors are involved. The first is the apparent increase in trend productivity growth. The resulting greater return on investm ent is keeping business investm ent spending at an advanced level, and the current and expected higher real wages are helping to keep household spending high. A rise in productivity growth, I m ight just note parenthetically, norm ally im plies an increase in real interest rates. So that is one factor. The second factor, I think, is the high credibility of our low inflation strategy. That supports the increases in real incom e and allows labor m arkets to operate at m uch lower unem ploym ent levels without generating the potentially inflationary wage increases that have been typical historically. As I see it, m aintaining this credibility is the key to what we can do to help sustain the expansion. In order to do that, I think we need to be sure 3/30/99 30 we interpret the risks in the outlook as accurately as we can. I would like to m ake a particular com ment about this. In the second half of 1997 and last year, there was a lot of concern, understandably, that the East Asian crisis would have a significant negative effect on the U.S. econom y. There certainly were som e negative effects. But there also were very powerful offsetting effects in the form  of a big capital inflow that helped hold U.S. interest rates down and in that way helped hold dom estic dem and up. At the end of the day, as I see it, the Asian crisis really didn’t have a terribly m arked negative effect on the U.S econom y. And I think these offsetting factors played at least as significant a role in this as our easing of policy last fall. In my view it is desirable, and I think im portant, to avoid a sim ilar possible prem ature conclusion going forward. In that regard, as I m entioned earlier, the Greenbook is projecting a significant further dete rioration in net exports this year, which is portrayed not only here but by a lot of other forecasters as a significant drag on U.S. growth. In the Greenbook, this deterioration is projected to be accom panied by a modestly stronger dollar which, of course, would help keep inflation in check. I can think of an alternative scenario, which is pr obably closer to John Makin’s point of view, where the trade deficit indeed widens, but in the absence of any tightening of U.S. policy or som e fortuitous capital inflow into the United States as we experienced last year, the dollar declines. I think there is am ple historical precedent for such a scenario. With the dollar depreciating, foreign central banks m ight well feel they have m ore room  to ease policy. But with the outlook for m uch of the rest of the world im proving and the U.S. econom y already operating well above potential GDP, a worldwide easing of policy could cause com modity prices to snap back. And that, along with the decline in the dollar, could well turn inflation expectations back up in this country. We could then find ourselves in a situation where we are forced to tighten sharply to contain inflation, with all that m ight im ply for the expansion going forward. Now, we m ay see this com ing in plenty of tim e to act in a m easured way to prevent it, but I wouldn’t count on it. I hope 3/30/99 31 that we will consider later in the m eeting som e near-term  preventive action that will reduce the risk that som ething like this scenario will unf old.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairm an, the Second District’s econom y showed m ore signs of brisk growth in the first quarter, with little increase in overall price pressures. In fact, the 12-m onth CPI increase in New York City at the end of February was 1.4 percent, so it was even lower than the national average. Unem ploym ent in New York and New Jersey fell to a cyclical low of 4.9 percent in Anecdotally, to go back to the discussion earlier about where m anufacturing workers go, we have a rather interesting m icrocosm  in the area between Albany and Buffalo--or probably an even sm aller area between Syracuse and Buffalo--where manufacturing jobs continue to be lost. The people find other jobs rather quickly or they migrate. The unem ploym ent rate in that area is quite low, in the 3 to 4 percent range. We have phenom ena like firm s from  Cleveland, Ohio holding a job auction in Buffalo, an indication of  the benef it to our society of  its ability to be f lexible. I would like to talk first about the international side and then go back to the domestic side. I continue to be concerned about the possible negative effects, even greater than those reflected in the Greenbook, on our econom y from  events abroad. Let me start with Japan, which we all know is in a serious recession. I am not at all optim istic that their recapitalization of the banking sector, although a good thing in and of itself, is going to have any positive effect on the econom y in term s of ending the credit crunch. This seem s to be a tim e of year when we have virtually nonstop visits by CEOs of Japanese banks. And I have yet to fi nd one who is planning to have his newly recapitalized bank becom e more aggressive in lending. Their posture is very m uch a defensive one. They have no additional ability to actually get rid of the underlying assets, which I think is essential to end the credit crunch in tim e. But probably m ore importantly, the Japanese visitors I’ve m et with, from  both the official and the private sectors, are talking m ore and m ore about their country being in the greatest cultural crisis 3/30/99 32 in their history--even greater than that of  the period of  the Meiji restoration or the period after the Second W orld W ar. What they are seeing is a breakdown in the traditional ability to m ake decisions and to arrive at policy. It is not likely in that kind of environm ent that the econom y will pull itself out of its recession faster than we think. In fact, it seem s to m e more likely that the econom y will continue to weaken sim ply because of an ever deteriorating level of confidence, both at the consum er and at the business levels. The recovery in the rest of Asia is spotty. One can see it in Thailand and Korea, especially in Korea. In Thailand one can see som e recovery by looking pretty hard, but it certainly is slow. In China, I think a leading indicator of what is going on is the The reason for that, I believe, is that the governm ent is getting m ore and m ore concerned that the Achilles heel of their restructuring--that is, the level of unem ploym ent as they restructure the state-owned enterprises--could be reaching the point of getting out of hand. They are doing som e in order to try to keep the lid on, but that is a very finely balanced approach. It always has been. I view that indicator as rather worrisom e. In Europe, econom ic growth is slow. There is very little going on at the governm ental level, except in the United Kingdom , to bring about the structural reform s that are required. Even though one does see bits of light at certain well m anaged companies in continental Europe, those econom ies are still a long way from  the kind of structural ref orm needed. I agree with earlier speakers that the Brazilian situation is better but also risky. It is a confidence-building effort in which the Brazilians m ay have overcom pensated by m aking the program  appear to be too successful too soon. As a technical m atter, their lowering of interest rates by 3 percentage points probably m ade sense. But it does have the significant risk of m aking everybody think that things are wonderful again. The Brazilians are wont to believe that. If there is a slowdown this summer, we could see a reversal in confidence that would be quite dam aging. The conclusion I draw from  all that is this: Although one need not be unnecessarily pessim istic about what is going on in the rest of the world, it is very 3/30/99 33 difficult to be optim istic about it or to think that there will be a positive effect on the United States that we don’t anticipate. Rather, it seem s to m e that the risks are on the downside. As for our dom estic econom y, it seem s to be behaving exactly in the way that the Federal Reserve should wish it to behave. We have sustained econom ic growth and we have price stability, which to the best of m y knowledge is what the Congress of the United States has told us is our m ission. Our Bank believes that we will continue to have a healthily growing econom y. And though our m odels forecast som e increased inflation in 2000, our m odels have been consistently wrong in forecasting inflation, as have everybody else’s m odels around this table. Therefore, I think we should be som ewhat modest about basing any policy change on that forecast. It seem s to m e that the present stance of policy is extrem ely well balanced. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Econom ic activity in the Philadelphia District rem ains strong and s hows few signs of slowing. Labor m arkets continue to be tight, but com petition rem ains fierce and there appear to be f ew inflationary pressures. The outlook is also positive whether one talks to m anufacturers, retailers, auto dealers, hom ebuilders, or com mercial real estate people. That said, however, one does not get the feeling that we are crossing over from  strong growth to boom  conditions. There is an absence of inflationary pressures in the pipeline. Businesses are still operating on the basis that prices will not rise. There is, to be sure, some upward pressure on wages, but productivity gains and cost-cutting are acting as effective offsets. And even in real estate, one does not get the sense of the kind of boom conditions that prevailed ten years ago, even in areas that are prone to such conditions. I think m uch the sam e can be said about the national econom y. We see strong growth, few signs of a buildup of inflationary pressures, and the absence of boom conditions. As for the risks, the upside risk to the dom estic econom y is still there, as it has been; and the downside risk f rom abroad is also still there, as it has been. The risk of financial contagion, while still there, appears to have subsided--a little anyway. 3/30/99 34 While a case can be m ade for tinkering with the federal funds rate to cancel, in effect, som e of the insurance we took out last fall, I am  much m ore persuaded that we should leave well enough alone for now and continue to see what unfolds in this truly remarkable econom y. And it is rem arkable in the sense that it is about everything one could wish for. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. With regard to the District econom y, overall conditions rem ain quite favorable and, if anything, activity has picked up a bit. Retail sales have been strong in recent m onths, m anufacturing activity for the most part has been positive, construction activity has certainly been healthy, and labor agricultural and other natural resource industries are continuing to struggle. Hom e sales in the Twin Cities m etropolitan area have slowed a bit, although realtors tell us that it is due to a lack of supply rather than a lack of dem and. And bankers are expressing a little concern about the credit quality of their com mercial loan portfolios--or rather the other guy’s com mercial loan portfolio. [Laughter] As far as the national econom y is concerned, I find m yself in agreem ent with the general pattern of the Greenbook forecast. By that I m ean that the current quarter is turning out very well once again and that the m oderation in real growth going forward, certainly relative to last year and m aybe to the last three years, is som ething with which I agree--without getting into details about the precise m agnitudes. I also would expect, as does the Greenbook, som e modest acceleration of inflation. Having said that, m y feeling is that the risks to the forecast, if anything, have diminished recently. Or m aybe I was sim ply too pessim istic earlier. On the upside, of course, the concern is not the rate of real growth but the rate of inflation that m ight accom pany it. And certainly in recent years I have been reducing m y inflation forecast with som e frequency. My sense is that m any of the rest of us have been doing the sam e thing, or have been reducing the level of the federal funds rate that goes with any inflation forecast, or both. 3/30/99 35 On the downside, I have been im pressed at the lack of repercussions from events in Brazil on the rest of Latin Am erica and elsewhere in the world. My feeling, for what it’s worth, is that we are in a better situation than I anticipated and that the risks going forward have dim inished, if anything. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. As I was preparing for today’s meeting, I was thinking about what has changed in the econom y that m ight require a change in the stance of m onetary policy. I cam e to the conclusion--sim ilar to what others have expressed--that a great deal has happened but in som e ways very little has changed. With respect to what has happened, the econom y to date obviously gives little evidence of a dom estic dem and-driven slowdown. Personal consum ption and business investm ent spending are both quite robust. I suppose this should not be surprising given the strength in em ploym ent and the relative ease of access to credit for both consum ers and businesses. Secondly, as Gary Stern com mented, the international econom ic outlook, though far from  settled, seem s a lot better than it has been at alm ost any tim e in the last eighteen m onths or so. Developing Asia is healing. I was interested to note just yesterday that short-term  interest rates in Korea and Thailand are both lower than they were at the start of the crisis, while their currencies have not in any sense gone down. In fact, they have stabilized and gone up som e. Moreover, contagion from  Brazil continues to be quite m ild with respect to most countries, Argentina being a m ajor exception. And Europe, while softening, clearly has som e room  for further m onetary response. I suspect and would not be surprised to see that occur. Japan obviously is a question m ark. It is facing a daunting set of very unattractive policy alternatives, but it does at this stage seem  to be bouncing along a relatively shallow bottom  and probably will continue to do so f or the f oreseeable f uture. I will not deny that there are som e risks there, but exactly how things are going to turn out is not yet clear. The third thing that has happened since we last m et is that inflation seem s to be doing som ething of a disappearing act. It is a bit like that cat in the m usical 3/30/99 36 “Cats” who, when the case is solved, is not there. Inflation seem s to have disappeared, at least currently and as far as one can see in the pipeline. One thing that has not changed very m uch is the contour of the Greenbook forecast. But I suspect, as with other forecasts, that we will take that with a grain of salt. Therefore, given the constellation of incom ing data and the uncertainty we all have at this stage with respect to our m odels, I believe that growth is likely to be greater than forecast. There is a possibility that the special factors that have held down inflation m ay start to unwind, but that m ay well occur in the context of an uptick in trend productivity growth. Therefore, while I can im agine som e reason to unwind a portion of the insurance that we took out last year, I think at this stage “steady as she goes” is probably the better policy approach. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The staff’s revised forecast features once again an upward revision to gr owth and a downward revision to inflation and hence a m ore favorable outcom e for 1999 than was projected in the last Greenbook. Nevertheless, the staff forecast raises an im portant question for m onetary policy going forward: How will the econom y make a successful transition to sustainable growth and labor m arket equilibrium  without an unacceptable increase in inflation?  The forces that threaten to raise inflation over the forecast horizon are the prospect of a dissipation of favorable supply shocks and the expected persistence of very tight labor m arkets. Of course, the staff forecast m ay be wrong and inflation m ay continue to decline. For m y part, I adm it that to date I have not been able to retire from  my discussions of econom ic perform ance the phrase “stronger-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected inflation.” Nevertheless, if one accepts the staff forecast, and I do, then it seem s to m e they have asked the right policy question and left it to us to answer it. The key to the outlook in the context of m onetary policy, therefore, is not the blissful state projected for 1999 but the pattern  of rising inflation, especially in 2000, and the prospect of further increases thereafter based on the continued labor m arket tightness 3/30/99 37 at the end of the forecast horizon. The key policy question, therefore, is whether and when to adjust policy to im prove the prospects of a better outcom e in 2000 and beyond. It is hard to m ake such a policy adjustm ent appear urgent today and, indeed, it is not. But I hope we can focus attention today less on the decision about what the target funds rate should be during the period from  March 30 to May 18, 1999, and m ore on whether and when an adjustm ent in policy m ight be appropriate in light of the forecast through 2000. I would also note that if a tighter policy appears justified, it m ight be better to m ove in that direction sooner, while the econom y is still growing above trend, than later when growth m ay already have slowed spontaneously to below trend. I accept in broad outline and in m ost details the staff forecast for growth over the forecast horizon, assum ing unchanged policy. The key developm ents recently have been stronger-than-expected momentum  in dom estic dem and in the first quarter, partially offset by sharper-than-expected declines in net exports and m ore-m oderate-than-expected inventory building. But the upward revision to GDP growth and the m ore favorable m ix of GDP projected for the first quarter provide two reasons to expect stronger second-quarter growth relative to the last forecast: stronger m omentum  in dem and and a positive contribution from inventory building. My m ain quibble with the staff forecast relates to the further upward revision to their estim ate of trend productivity growth. That revision, though sm all, lowers the staff inflation forecast by perhaps as m uch as ¼ percentage point by the end of 2000. As a result, I am  a little m ore pessim istic than the staff about the inflation outlook in 2000 and beyond. But the key to the inflation forecast is that the initial conditions--the very tight labor m arkets--would m ake it very difficult to avoid a significant increase in inflation without an adjustm ent to policy, even if the econom y were to slow to trend immediately. To put into perspective the im plications of the initial conditions in the staff forecast, let m e pose the following question: How well will we take advantage of the extraordinary disinflationary forces during this expansion, given the staff forecast or m y slightly m ore pessim istic scenario, in order to lower the underlying inflation trend going 3/30/99 38 forward? Another way of  asking this question is: To what degree will the current episode be an exam ple of opportunistic disinflation?  Inflation m easured by the core CPI was 3.1 percent over 1995 before the coincidence of favorable inflation developm ents impacted the econom y. How m uch will we lower inflation over the expansion from  this point with the help of the extraordinary di sinflationary forces that are so clearly important? Let’s take the staff forecast first. To put inflation on a m ethodologically consistent basis, I add 0.6 percentage point to their estim ate of 2.5 percent for the core inflation rate over the year 2000. So the staff’s forecast says that we have not lowered the underlying inflation rate at all. We get the sam e conclusion if we use the GDP chain measure of inflation. Of course, inflation is rising at the end of the forecast period, so we can inf er that bef ore this expansion is over inf lation actually will have increased despite the extraordinary disinflationary forces at work. In my forecast, the latter outcom e is m ore evident and em erges earlier. What is driving this outcom e? Blessed with a com bination of positive supply shocks and supply-enhancing structural changes, m onetary  policy is the critical factor shaping how the benefits of these developm ents are shared between higher output and lower inflation during the expansion and, therefore, how they will affect the underlying trend of inflation beyond this expansion. To date their benefits have been split between higher output and lower inflation. However, in the process--in the staff’s judgm ent and m ine as well--we have allowed the econom y to m ove beyond its sustainable capacity. The low overall CPI inflation during the period of supply shocks will be partly reversed as the supply shocks dissipate. That is an im portant part of the inflation story this year. And the benefits of a possible upward shift in the productivity trend itself are transitory, unless taken advantage of by m onetary policy. To be sure, recent econom ic developm ents have been exceptional. It has been a wonderful ride, and we have all enjoyed it. But we will ultim ately be graded--and indeed we will grade ourselves--on the ef fect of  current policy on the inf lation trend in coming years. Might we not achieve a higher grade on the final exam  by accepting a less 3/30/99 39 exceptional growth perform ance in the near term ? That is the question we have to answer in com ing m onths. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The basic condition of the econom y in this country is well known by everybody here. It has been very well articulated this m orning and I will not try to recite again all the factors involved. At our last m eeting I felt that the risks faced by policym akers were balanced but that if the upside risks brought on by overly strong growth did not begin to m oderate soon, they would need to be addressed. That m oderation has not becom e evident as yet and the case can be m ade that the tim e may have com e to take a first step. I find m yself pulled toward an asym metric directive. But two factors give m e pause. First, an asym metric directive, if im mediately announced under our new policy, would quite likely cause a spontaneous increase in m arket rates, especially since it would come as a surprise to m any. Such a response m ight well turn out to be prem ature but, more im portantly, would be undesirable because of m y second reason. That second reason is that we seem  to be m oving ever closer to what could becom e a very nasty war in the Balkans. Indeed, it has begun. We all pray for an early peaceful solution, but we cannot know what will happen. At a m oment such as this, if the Com mittee considered it necessary to raise rates for whatever reason, it should and would do so. If, however, the Com mittee were m erely inclined to get a preem ptive jum p on a likely threat, I question whether it would be wise to do so at a tim e like this, rather than await further developm ents in a potentially dangerous situation. Like the m ilitary itself when it is heading toward a fight, it probably would be a good idea to keep our powder dry.

Those of you who are careful listeners will rem ember m y comments about the little elves who get their kicks out of confounding the experts and modelers and doom sayers by m aking the U.S. econom y perform  just a bit better than any of those folks im agined that it could. Well, as I read things, not only have the elves been 3/30/99 40 scoring again on all fronts, they have driven the enem y from  the field. Now they are writing the Greenbook! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Is that a short person joke?  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN. Despite Mike Prell’s denial of “new era” thinking, the Greenbook forecast actually looks pretty good. And as Cathy Minehan pointed out earlier, a good deal of the shift in the staff’s thinking over tim e reflects changing views about productivity and hence about potential growth. As I read what they are saying at the m oment, it is that the econom y could grow at roughly 3 percent for quite a while, with unem ploym ent below 4.5 percent and with not very visible internal pressure on inflation, although one has to worry about risks from  outside supply shocks. The favorable current picture has been detailed around the table and seem s to validate the Greenbook optim ism. We have the phenom enon of growth slowing from  the improbably torrid pace of the fourth quarter to a still strong but seem ingly m ore solid rate at present. We have continued extrem e tightness in labor m arkets everywhere but no sign of general wage inflation--indeed suggestions of deceleration--well predicted by our staff, it should be said. We have rapid productivity growth plus a wildly com petitive econom y in which no one thinks they have any pricing power, which apparently allows real earnings to rise and be com bined with declining inflation without putting any stress on profits. We have a core CPI that has risen only about 2 percent over the last year despite outsized jum ps in tobacco prices. The latter have to be considered good news if they induce som e people, particularly young people, not to sm oke as m uch. We have other inflation indicators still falling. And the outlook for the next year or two, while showing som e acceleration in inflation, is so benign that I think the elves are getting bored or becom ing bureaucratized. Even the worries that Brazil m ight fall apart and precipitate another overseas downward spiral, which seem ed quite real at the tim e of the last FOMC m eeting, have receded som ewhat. The view has turned into som e modest optim ism of “the worst m ay be over variety” and an expectation of slow but sure recovery in the world econom y. 3/30/99 41 Are there risks? Certainly there are. On the upside there is the risk that the stock m arket’s apparently unwarranted continued upward price m arch m ay accelerate again to even m ore bubbly heights, leading to  a devastating crash when the bubble bursts. Another risk is that all the things that have held inflation in check for so long will suddenly reverse, leading to an upward jolt to prices that m ight be sufficient to rekindle inflationary expectations and leave inflati on fighters playing catch-up. Another is that some unforeseen set of events in an unnam ed country m uch bigger than Ecuador--som e have nam ed China--will set off a new round of investor panic on the international scene. These are all possible. But the risk of  rapid shif ts seem s a little f ar-fetched. The m ore likely m oderate turns for the worse that m ight occur seem  likely to do so in the context of a fairly firm  atmosphere of confidence am ong investors and consum ers in the United States and of low inflation expectations so that rapid snowballing effects are unlikely. The sustained solid good news for quite a long tim e now on both growth and inflation seem s to m e to have brought us to a point where we will have tim e to react even if the good news begins to turn. So I see the risks as fairly balanced, with not a great deal of urgency for us to be preem ptive. In the m eantim e, there is a serious task for econom ic analysts all around the country--not so m uch at the Board, although he re too--to try to find out why things are going so well and what we can do to keep them  going well. That analysis m ust focus on what is really happening at the firm , the household, and the m arket levels. It is hard not to conclude from  recent events that tight labor m arkets are good for productivity growth, or can be under certain circum stances. W hat is happening to m ake this true?  Is it that new m anagem ent attitudes see scarce labor as an opportunity to reengineer processes or substitute capital f or labor, or both? Is it that an awareness of  the im portance of  skill acquisition and adaptability, com bined with new techniques f or training both on the job and in newly f lexible and relevant educational institutions such as com munity colleges, has given new opportunities for productivity im provem ents? Is it that new workers moving into the tight labor m arkets have a m ajor contingent of unusually am bitious and upwardly m obile im migrant workers?  Does it relate to the unusual backlog of 3/30/99 42 technological innovations flowing out of new kinds of practical research and developm ent?  The answers are not going to be found in m acro statistics or in m odels. We have to get into the interstices to find out what is happening and how we can keep it going. But that is not such a bad assignm ent for analysts--to investigate the causes of the good news.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, econom ic conditions in the Eighth District are largely the sam e. Some industries and som e geographic regions are doing a little better and som e are doing a little worse, but the overall picture is certainly one of steady, sustained growth without undue strains or problem s. Two of m y contacts, one at FedEx and one at UPS, both report steady growth in their dom estic business. My contact at FedEx had som e detailed com ments about the company’s international business. He said that Fed Ex is seeing the first pickup in a year in its international business--an increase of 18 percent in the latest quarter on a year-over-year basis--led by strong shipm ents originating in Asia and going both to the United States and to Europe. That would suggest th at exports are flowing out of Asia. South Asia had the best growth, Japan showed single-digit rates of increase, and growth in Europe was slowing a bit but still fairly strong. However, there was no growth whatsoever in the traffic from  the United Stat es to Japan, and that would be consistent with what we know from  other sources. I was particularly interested in talking with contacts and others about the labor m arket situation. I heard from  these people the sam e stories we have been hearing about problem s in recruiting entry-level em ployees and problem s with increased turnover. I have been trying to m ake sense out of that situation. I certainly do not get the im pression that the business leaders I am  talking to believe this is anything approaching a crisis situation. They are learning to live with it. Nevertheless, I have the distinct im pression that they regard the situation as inherently tem porary; it’s not something they want to see continue nor do they expect it to go on indefinitely. They are expecting som e of the pressure to com e off. Of course, that is the sam e story we have 3/30/99 43been hearing for eighteen m onths now, and the pressure has not com e off. But the strains have not been so severe as to cause them  to do anything very dram atic. There continues to be pressure around the edges in com pensation that is not showing up in the wage numbers. is providing tuition scholarships because a lot employees are part-tim e and so forth.

But I would like to suggest that som e of the di fferences around the table m ay reflect different views on what our inflation target really ought to be. My own view is that our inflation target ought to be in the neighborhood of 1 percent on the CPI. Given the not com pletely understood discrepancy between the CPI and the GDP chain index, perhaps I should say 1½ percent on the CPI. My suspicion--though of course I would let everyone speak for himself on this--is that som e people around this table are m ore com fortable with allowing the inflation rate target to be som ewhat higher because they believe it is inappropriate to try to push it down. So, certainly, m y policy views reflect in part m y belief that we are 3/30/99 44 clearly on the high side of the appropriate inflation target. I just throw this question out as som ething we ought to be clear about: To what extent do our policy differences reflect differences in our views about the outlook and the risks, and to what extent do they depend on differences in where we really want to go in the long run?

MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Before I com ment on current events, I would like to step back to another interesting tim e, the 1960s. At that tim e we thought the rate of productivity growth was high and the NAIRU was low, though we didn’t call it NAIRU then. It turned out we were wrong on both counts. Both variables, which one m ight expect to change at rather glacial rates, seem ed to change rather abruptly--the NAIRU in the late 1960s and productivity growth in the early 1970s. It is difficult to proclaim  that now is another era of abrupt shifts--the truth only becom es known m any years after the fact--but there is som e evidence in favor of that hypothesis. The staff has done calculations of productivity and it looks as if there is enough evidence to suggest an upturn in productivity growth rates of about ½ percentage point beginning in about 1995. The staff has also done NAIRU calculations. While these are m uch m ore speculative because the NAIRU is not directly observable--and m any things could be responsible for the good price behavior--at least one interpretation of the data is that the NAIRU shifted down by about ½ percentage point also in about 1995. One could m ake a justifiable case for an even larger shift in the NAIRU. The evidence is still m urky. But this could be a tim e when the unfavorable shifts of the late 1960s have been reversed and, as then, the shifts could have taken place rather abruptly. I won’t get into causes. There could be m any, and a num ber of you have raised interesting hypotheses. But the im plication is im portant. If we have had this dual shift, the implication is that output could grow at a rate  of nearly 3 percent a year without sparking new inflation and that unem ploym ent could stay in the neighborhood of 5 percent or perhaps even a bit below that, again without sparking new inflation. One apparent casualty here is the Taylor rule, which is now telling us that we should be raising interest rates significantly. As I have noted before, and others have 3/30/99 45 also, that rule needs precise point estim ates of the inflation and unem ploym ent targets. If the estim ates are off, the advice is off. We could get around these uncertainties by supplanting the Taylor rule with what I will call a speed lim it rule: That we should target growth in aggregate dem and at about 3 percent, or perhaps a bit less, and stay with that policy as long as inflation does not accelerate. On the dem and side, conditions look about right. The current Greenbook forecast for 1999 is exactly 3 percent, with so me slowdown forecast after that. I will not go through all the forecasting uncertainties; they have been talked about at length. But I will point out that m ost Blue Chip forecasts are in a very sim ilar neighborhood and, as many of you have said, m ost Reserve Bank forecasts are as well. On the inflation side, the Greenbook does forecast a m oderate pickup, but it is partly due to special factors such as oil, with only a relatively sm all am ount due to tight labor m arkets. The latest evidence, after stripping out various kinds of shocks, seem s to suggest a slight deceleration, not acceleration, in the trend of both prices and wages. Surveys of inflation anticipations do not show m uch evidence of acceleration. There has been a very slight increase recently in anticipated inflation based on a com parison of long-term  nom inal and real interest rates. But this increase is m ore likely explained by the reversal of  flight-to-quality f actors that had previously lowered nom inal interest rates more than real rates. The Blue Chip forecasters continue to write down their inflation forecasts even as they write up their real output forecasts. Putting it all together, it is hard for m e to find m uch evidence of accelerating inflation right now. But this all involves guesses and estim ates. What if we are wrong? In that regard we m ay benefit from  another welcom e change. Monetary policy m ay work more quickly than we had thought previously. There is lots of uncertainty about that as well. It is a good area for research. But in addition to the reasons that Alice Rivlin brought up earlier, another factor is how anticipatory credit m arkets have becom e. The Chairm an could change long-term  interest ra tes by 25 basis points, if he wanted to, by just frowning in a certain way! [Laughter] So, if the lags are shorter, being wrong does not trouble m e quite as m uch as it did a while back. We should look at the evidence 3/30/99 46 carefully, particularly on inflation and dem and growth, and change rates quickly if we need to. But as others have said, I don’t think we have to be preem ptive now. This all adds up to an argum ent that our present policy stance is about right. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. In the m aterial we received at the hotel last night was the proposed draft statem ent of the directive, which begins: “The inform ation reviewed at this m eeting suggests that the expansion in econom ic activity has moderated in early 1999.” I was curious whether I would hear that view expressed around the table because I certainly did not hear it in m y District. I have not heard it around the table. If that sentence is supposed to convey som ething about the real GDP number, I don’t think it fully captures what we have been hearing and feeling about econom ic activity, whether from  the Purchasing Managers’ Report or anything else. The directors and Advisory Council m embers in m y District continue to be generally upbeat about the first quarter. While we’ve had som e reports of a slowing in demand in these first few m onths com pared to the fourth quarter of last year, which was surprisingly strong to m ost people, those were  more than offset by reports of further increases in sales and orders in the first quarter. Retailers, who had expected a slowing after the surprisingly strong year-end num bers, are now reporting that the first quarter will show f urther increases. They also say that their inventories are below desired levels and that they want to try to get them  up. One retailer said that catalog sales were up sharply com pared to in-store sales, about 30 percent in the first two m onths of this year versus last year. They break their sales figures into two com ponents, those from  800-number calls and those from  Internet orders. The Internet share has risen dram atically, and the profit m argin on the Internet sales share is significantly higher than on the 800-number catalog sales. The labor m arkets continue to be tight throughout the District, especially in the southwest Ohio and central Kentucky m etro areas where reported unem ploym ent is less than 2 percent. As others have noted, tem porary em ploym ent agencies say they have more requests for workers than they can m eet. One large regional com mercial bank that 3/30/99 47 is headquartered in the Cincinnati area but operates in several states said it currently has over 500 approved openings that it is unable to fill. Com panies, both large and sm all, continue to report an escalation of health care costs. Some of the increases they report are really very, very high. Some com panies are trying to contain these costs by cutting coverage or by raising the deductibles. They are targeting prescription drugs especially because they say those costs are rising very, very rapidly; so they are trying to get the em ployees to pay m ore of the cost for prescriptions. One com pany with a unionized workforce is bargaining for what they call a “total com pensation increase” over the life of the contract and letting the union and the employees decide how m uch will go into the paycheck and how m uch will go into benefits. They say that if they can contain the increase over the life of the contract to a total of 6 percent per year for the two com ponents, they will be satisfied. Construction spending is accelerating further from  the record 1998 pace, and unions are reporting that contractors are now offering bonuses to previously retired construction workers to com e back into the workf orce, especially to train and tutor apprentice workers. We even have had som e reports of retailers giving as their reason for going out of business the difficulty and cost of attracting and retaining workers. Bankers continue to report strong loan dem and. Hom e sales have been so strong that there is a growing backlog of appraisals to be done. As Mike Moskow reported, steel com panies are feeling a lot better about their situation, especially since steel exports fr om Japan have dropped off sharply. They do mention that there has been som e increase in steel com ing from  Europe and Mexico. Nevertheless, consum ption of steel has continued to be extrem ely strong, and price increases have been posted for the second quarter. We don’t know if those price increases are going to stick, but the industry is quick to point out that the increases are only a reversal of price cuts taken last year that they considered too large. So, in their view, the price hikes are not inflationary. 3/30/99 48 Turning to the national scene, I would note that also in our hotel room s last night was a copy of the Board staff’s briefing yesterday on dom estic nonfinancial developm ents. I thought that did a very good job of sum marizing what the im plications of an im proving productivity trend--technological efficiencies or those other labels we have talked about in analyzing the real growth num bers--m ight be for m onetary policy. I would encourage the staff to go further in that analysis to develop an understanding of the im plications for the financial sector, not only for banks but for other financial interm ediaries. There m ay be im plications for asset-based lending or incom e-stream  or working-capital-based lending if lenders begin to m ake som e mistakes. There is a tendency to overshoot especially when negative second differences com e into play and the rate of change starts to slow. Both short-run business earnings and m arket valuations of assets can be influenced by the dynam ics that are described in that analysis. If so, an inherited approach to credit risk analysis would subsequently prove to have been a myopic way to look at the risk/return relationship. One does not have to have been a lender in Southern California, Arizona, Texas, or som e other places in the 1980s to see how those dynam ics work out. But the people who m ade those m istakes back then are now retired, so I guess there’s a new group that has to repeat those m istakes. The tendency is for positive productivity surprises, by their very nature, to be reflected in favorable earnings reports. If that tendency has been am plified by a failure of workers or their union leaders to fully appreciate that the value of the m arginal product of labor has in fact risen, then there is going to be a further but tem porary acceleration in returns to capital versus returns to labor. And those dynam ics at som e point have to reverse. A reversion to conditions where real wages do reflect the value of the m arginal product of labor, which we know will ultim ately happen, requires a m irror im age of surprises on the returns to capital. The risk to f inancial stability depends on the ability of lenders, both banks and financial interm ediaries, to absorb those adverse surprises. As I’ve said before, stability in various m easures of average prices of consum er goods is not a suf ficient condition f or overall m onetary and f inancial stability. It is a bigger issue than that. Thank you. 3/30/99 49

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think we can break for coffee. [Coffee break] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Don Kohn has the floor. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I will be referring to the table m arked “Financial Conditions.” 2 / Once again the Com mittee is faced with considering policy against the backdrop of unexpected strength in output and weakness in inflation. Central to that consideration would seem  to be the need to determ ine whether financial conditions are consistent with econom ic growth slowing to trend reasonably prom ptly, preventing substantial further tightening of the labor m arket. If they are, the case for continued “watchful waiting” would be strengthened, though the question of whether the level of production when growth finally slowed was too high to be sustained without inflation pressures em erging would still be open. To help with judging the appropriateness of current financial conditions, I have distributed a table showing inform ation on key financial returns, prices, and quantities. I chose two tim e periods to com pare with current conditions: The first is the average of June and July of last year, which predates the Russian crisis and subsequent turm oil in financial action. Other things equal--m ost im portantly the underlying strength of demand--over tim e, unchanged financial conditions in real term s should be consistent with output growing around its long-term  trend rate. In the context of the current situation, such financial conditions ought to contribute to a slowing of the pace of econom ic expansion to around the rate of growth of its potential, although the average level of output would not necessarily line up with the level of the econom y's potential. Looking across these periods, what is striking is how little effect monetary policy easing has had on m any of these m easures. Short-term borrowing costs for businesses, lines one and two, have fallen, of course, but tightening standards and non-price term s at banks over this interval have probably offset the effect of som e of the recorded drop in the average bank loan rate. Lower short-term  rates have not shown through to the cost of longer-term  business credit, lines 3, 4, and 5, perhaps the m ore im portant determ inant of spending. Investors have becom e much m ore discrim inating, and while the highest quality borrowers have experienced a On average, it would appear that the nom inal cost of long-term  credit to 2 / A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Kohn is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 2) 3/30/99 50 businesses has changed little on balance since Novem ber and has increased a bit since early last sum mer. With longer-term  inflation expectations dropping since then, as shown by the survey results on lines 16 and 17 at the bottom  of the table, real long-term  borrowing costs m ost likely have risen. In the household sector, nom inal interest rates are about unchanged on fixed-rate m ortgages, line 7, but have declined on consum er credit, here represented by auto loans at banks, line 8. Trend growth in the m onetary assets of households and others, shown by M2, line 11, rem ains quite rapid. However, expansion in broad m oney has slowed m ore sharply in March than had been expected, suggesting that m ore of the spurt of last autum n might have been attributable to m arket turm oil than we had estim ated and that a slower growth trend m ay be em erging. The foreign exchange value of the dollar, lines 12 and 13, has fallen m odestly on balance since last June and July, but has appreciated since Novem ber. In fact, after the recent firming of interest and exchange rates, m arkets have already taken out many of the effects of the third easing last Novem ber, and they have done so without building in expectations of  an im minent tightening on your part. The notable exception to this pattern of generally m oderate and m ixed changes in financial conditions, of course, is the stock m arket. The cost of equity capital for business, line 6, apparently has dropped considerably further and the im petus to spending from  outsized increases in household wealth rem ains substantial. The longer-run m oving average of equity price increases, line 10, is weighted to capture the lagged effects of stock m arket wealth on consum ption; it suggests that the contribution of equity appreciation to growth above trend has eased only m odestly since last summer. In the staff forecast, equity prices decrease slightly and interest and exchange rates rem ain near current levels so that financial conditions are roughly unchanged for som e time. This stability stands in sharp contrast to the substantial declines in long-term  interest rates and increases in equity prices in the year leading up to last June and July, which undoubtedly contributed to above-trend growth. Stable conditions should, other things equal, tend to slow econom ic growth to a rate m ore in line with the econom y's trend rate of growth. Of course other things in addition to the changes in financial m arkets captured in the table have not been equal over the last nine m onths. Importantly, prospective foreign dem and has been revised down considerably as the em erging m arket crisis has spread to Latin Am erica and the Japanese and European econom ies have weakened. At the sam e time, domestic dem and has been m ore resilient than anticipated. However, Mike has discussed a num ber of stock-flow or accelerator-type relationships that 3/30/99 51 work in the staff forecast to reinforce the tendency for the econom y to slow at the stable financial conditions assum ed in that forecast. As noted, reasonable prospects that such a slowing will occur bef ore very long would seem  to be an im portant factor behind a decision to keep policy unchanged in the near term . Halting the intensification of strains on labor resources at som e point is a necessary condition for keeping inflation in check. It may not be suf ficient: Inflation pressures still m ay build, as they do in the staff forecast, even around current levels of labor utilization. In that case, the funds rate will eventually need to be raised to contain inflation pressures. But in light of the considerable uncertainty about the relationship of labor m arket tightness to inflation, if the econom y is expected to slow, the Com mittee m ay opt to await firm er evidence that costs and prices are likely to accelerate. The recent downturns in 12-m onth averages of inflation in core CPI and nom inal wages serve to underline these uncertainties and also should help to keep inflation expectations in check as the Com mittee sorts through the incom ing data for early signs of building inflation. In contrast, expectations that growth will continue to exceed its longer-run trend for som e time might warrant consideration of near-term policy firm ing, even without hard evidence in hand of an upturn in price inflation. A significantly delayed econom ic slowing could leave labor than today. The subsequent tightening of policy and induced weakness in econom ic activity needed to correct those im balances would tend to be larger and hence m ore disruptive. Moreover, the possible downside risks to the forecast that the Com mittee was in part insuring against in its easing moves last fall have dim inished in recent m onths. Emerging m arket econom ies generally have weathered the effects of Brazilian problem s and shown increasing signs that investors are regaining confidence. In domestic financial m arkets, liquidity has im proved substantially, and risk appetites and assessm ents look m ore reasonable. hence would react strongly. In a situation that called for policy firm ing such a reaction m ight be seen as a necessary aspect of im parting restraint on dem and, provided it were orderly and did not precipitate a renewal of exaggerated f lights to quality and liquidity. In that regard, the im proving trends in dom estic and foreign financial m arkets have not been hindered by the appreciable backup in interm ediate- and long-term  interest rates in the United States over the interm eeting period. To be sure, the effect on not likely to be the sam e as the effects of experiencing such a firm ing 3/30/99 52 today. But the reaction of m arkets m ay indicate at least that the chances of disruption from  a policy tightening today are considerably sm aller even than they were from  not easing a short tim e ago. If the Com mittee saw the probability of a turnaround in inflation as having risen, and as now m ore sizable than the probability of undue softness in activity, but not by enough to tighten policy at this m eeting, it might want to consider adoption of an asym metrical directive. Such a directive has m eant different things to  different people at different tim es. But based on past experience, an initial shift to asym metry m ight connote that, in light of those risks, the Com mittee saw its next m ove as m ore likely to be a firm ing than an easing and that such an action probably was m ore than a theoretical possibility in the distant f uture. The Com mittee has reaffirm ed its option to announce im mediately such a shift in its outlook. As a rem inder, the Minutes and the Chairm an’s testim ony noted that not every change in tilt would be published immediately and that those that were would m eet a couple of criteria: They would represent a significant change in the Com mittee’s thinking, one that was not appreciated by the public or the m arkets, and one in which that lack of understanding or knowledge could seriously m islead the public and At this tim e, markets have built in expectations that your next m ove is more likely to be a tightening than an easing, but not any tim e soon. predict, and could be shaped to a degree by the accom panying announcem ent. We did, unfortunately, have one recent test--the leak of the futures m arkets m oved up their im plied probability of  firming at the next meeting to 30 percent, and interm ediate- and long-term  rates backed up 10 basis points even though m arkets already had built in a 10 percent chance of firm ing. A case could be m ade for a m ore m uted response today on the grounds that m arkets would take into account the fact that after March 1997 the m any asym metrical directives toward tightening were not reliable predictors of subsequent Com mittee action. But the Com mittee did say that it was reserving announcem ents for significant shifts that it wanted to alert the m arkets to; and with no near-term  policy f irming now built into the yield curve, an even larger reaction than a year ago is a distinct possibility. Markets m ight build in substantial odds on tightening in May or June, and ratchet up expectations of short-term  rate levels for the rest of 1999 and 2000 as well. Moreover, with the Com mittee having alerted the incom ing data especially hard for their im plications for the next m eeting. 3/30/99 53 If the Com mittee sees firm ing action over its next few m eetings as considerably m ore probable than is now built into the m arkets, it m ight want to consider publication as well as adoption of an asym metrical directive. Presum ably, the Com mittee would be contem plating such a possibility because it was concerned about the strength of dem and and its implications for inflation. In this circum stance, the m arket reaction would be helpful, putting in place som e probably needed restraint m ore quickly than if the Com mittee had sim ply waited and then tightened. If, on the other hand, the adoption of an asym metrical directive was seen as a m ore m arginal shift, reflecting a changing balance of risks but not necessarily significantly higher odds of tightening at upcom ing m eetings, then the extent of m arket m isunderstanding is relatively less, as is the need for im mediate restraint. Indeed, encouraging the m arket to build in a significant chance of tightening would itself be m isleading. In this case, the Com mittee could allow the asym metry to be published in the Minutes of this m eeting to be released in May, explaining why it did not choose to publish it im mediately. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for Don?  If not, let m e get started. For quite a while our Greenbook and indeed all m odels have been projecting slower econom ic growth and higher inflation than actually have m aterialized. Looking back, it is conceivable and perhaps likely that the m ajor explanation for these projection errors is that the m odels have m issed the extent of the acceleration in productivity. By that I m ean that the cyclically adjusted rate of increase in productivity, as now shown in the data, has been rising appreciably since the m id-1990s. The evidence of this in the underlying data is fairly clear-cut. That is, the speed-up of productivity growth can explain to a large extent both the significant acceleration in GDP from  the supply side, as a num ber of you have indicated, and the suppression of unit labor costs and total unit costs m ore generally, which in turn explains the softness in inflation. The interesting question, however, is how to project that trend of acceleration in productivity. It is clear arithm etically, and indeed it is in the nature of any structural model with fixed coefficients, that if we continuously underestim ate one fundam ental variable that is rising faster than its unde rlying coefficient would suggest, then once we stabilize its rate of growth, we engender the type of forecast that we have in the 3/30/99 54 Greenbook, nam ely, a forecast that im plies a slowdown in econom ic activity or econom ic growth and an acceleration in inflation. That is algebraically necessary. I think the question on the table is whether we are looking at an aberration or at the em ergence of a new era. If we take away the new era alternative and ask ourselves what the cyclically adjusted productivity growth rate was for a significant part of the pre-1995 period, it was flat. Indeed, one of the m ore interesting statistics that corroborates this independently is that terribly flawed num ber that we often discuss, the expected long-term  growth in earnings per share of the S&P 500 as estim ated by security analysts. Such analysts throughout the country predict the individual com pany earnings that are aggregated in an averaging process of the I/B/E/S organization. As we are all aware, those forecasts are highly biased on the upside. Nevertheless, if we look at the history of these long-term  earnings expectations, from  1983 until late 1994 the data fluctuated in a very narrow range of about 1 percentage point. If we presum e that the bias in those num bers has not changed significantly over the years--and there is no evidence that it has--we then see a m ajor breakout of this series in late 1994. Between late 1994 and the current m onth, the rise is alm ost 3 full percentage points. What does that m ean?  It m eans basically that the earnings expectations for individual com panies, as evaluated by the security analysts who obviously are speaking to corporate m anagem ent and getting an excess dose of optim ism, are changing very dram atically. These are long-term  earnings expectations of individual companies that are not unrepresentative of the econom y as a whole. I will argue that the noncorporate sector, which is not included, does raise very interesting statistical problem s. In any event, we are looking at som ething that raises a question as to why the analysts are changing those estim ates. Roughly 40 percent of the earnings stem  from foreign affiliates and are foreign directed. It just is not credible that the acceleration in long-term  earnings expectations in the last year has been the result of a m ajor increase in expected long-term  earnings of foreign affiliates. This underscores the likelihood that increased earnings are basically dom estic. 3/30/99 55 Since pricing power is clearly nonexistent, the im proved earnings expectations have to be the result of cost containm ent of som e form  or another, which on a consolidated basis is essentially labor productivity for the econom ic system . We therefore have a variable m issing from  our m odels, if I m ay put it that way, which is essentially this change in expected long-term  earnings. Those of you who have seen the chart know that there was a dram atic acceleration that started in late 1994 and has persisted. The rise is not a cyclical change; the line just keeps going straight up. It slowed a little during the crisis in the sum mer of 1998 and previously in the crisis in 1997, but it did not go down; it just flattened out and then it took off again. If we could forecast that variable, it strikes m e that we would have a very important insight into the process. But im plicit in the Greenbook forecast, and indeed in everybody else’s forecast, is that this variable will flatten out because a constant cyclically adjusted long-term  growth rate in output per hour is also im plicit. That has not occurred in the last four years or so. However, this process is incom plete, m eaning that it still has som e distance to go. You m ay recall the anecdotal com ments at our last m eeting about technological synergies. Reportedly, they are occurring at a pace that im plies that rates of  return on new capital f acilities vis-à-vis the cost of  capital still have not crested. Anecdotally, people we speak to in businesses such as com puters, software, telecom munications, and obviously the Internet all say that the backlog of potential profit-m aking investm ents is still rising. That is what the security analysts are saying. The latter obviously are not independent observations. It is just that the security analysts’ expectation is a far broader sam ple m easuring the sam e phenom enon. As a consequence of all this, we were all concerned at the last m eeting, and I think rightfully so, that we were experiencing a m ajor acceleration in aggregate dem and. And if anything, the acceleration is even greater now. The num bers for private dom estic final purchases are truly awesom e, as everyone has been observing. Everyone has been concerned about weakness in m anufacturing, but I suspect that m anufacturing activity m ay have turned up. Indeed, som e of the num bers we use to estim ate industrial production suggest that the m anufacturing com ponent of industrial 3/30/99 56 production could very readily be up ½ percentage point in March. That is showing up in the Chicago Purchasing Managers’ report as well as in a lot of anecdotes relating to the manufacturing sector. There is no evidence of which I am  aware of any acceleration in prices. I think the uptick in the Chicago Purchasing Managers’ prices-paid survey reflects the rise in oil prices. Everybody has seen an oil price increase, and the proportion of people who report that they have seen price increases goes up every tim e there is an increase in oil prices. But oil prices are not what they used to be in this econom y. The extent to which energy affects m anufacturing industries has declined dram atically, and the im pact of oil on GDP and inflation has fallen quite m arkedly. We have to be careful in our assessm ent of the CPI. That m easure of prices can show a big increase, and it has. But the CPI is a f lawed statistic; it is a statistic that overweighs housing and overweighs a significant part of personal consum ption expenditures. The big difference between the PCE chain-weighted index and the CPI is largely in the weights. That is, if we ask people what they spend m oney on, which is the basis of the CPI survey, they rem ember their housing costs. When we m atch the housing costs, m ortgage paym ents, and all the big ticket item s against known retail sales, we discern a very significant bias in the weighting system  of the CPI that is creating a considerable divergence from  the far superior PCE deflator. Nonetheless, in the first two months of this year the two m easures have shown the sam e thing, virtually zero inflation, both on the total and on the core. That is going to change for the March data as the oil prices com e in significantly higher for the CPI than for the PCE. What is m ore interesting are the wage data, which I find increasingly difficult to understand. Why are wage increases slowing down in this exceptionally tight labor the extent to which wages have decelerated in this period when the labor m arkets are so tight. Nonetheless, the com bination of a slightly slower rate of increase in com pensation per hour and accelerated productivity has lowered the growth in unit labor costs for the nonfinancial corporate area to 0.1 percent over the last four quarters, a significant 3/30/99 57 improvem ent. That is a lower increase in unit labor costs than in the preceding period. As a consequence, the change in value-added prices in the nonfinancial corporate sector-­that is, the deflator for gross product originating from  corporations--is actually negative and has been negative for a num ber of quarters. The difficulty that I have in looking at overall business sector productivity is an issue that we have discussed previously, nam ely that the m easurem ents we see in the corporate and the noncorporate areas cannot be reconciled. The m argins of noncorporate profits, if I m ay use the term , are not bad. Yet the im plicit output per hour num ber in total business sector productivity or nonfarm  business sector productivity is picking up an implicit output per hour num ber in noncorporate business that has been declining, on balance, for two decades. For exam ple, in industries where we have very significant amounts of noncorporate business--the legal profession, the m edical profession, and business services--m easured annual productivity has declined about 2 percent per annum on average since the late 1970s. That is just not credible. So, we have a m ajor m easurem ent error problem  in the noncorporate area that distorts our view of what is happening to productivity. As a result, the corporate data-­especially nonfinancial corporate data--are far m ore reliable. When we look at manufacturing, the num bers are rising at a very sharp pace, m ore than for all nonfinancial corporations. I might add that the January-February data for m anufacturing show strong productivity growth, to the extent that we have hard data, and they show unit costs going down. Indeed, if anything, overall m argins in the m ost recent quarters are starting to open up after being constrained through a good part of last year. And the num bers for farm  productivity, for which we have hard data, are rising over 4 percent per year. So, the crucial statistic that is throwing this whole forecast off is the growth rate of productivity, properly m easured. When the increase in that num ber slows, then I think the new era will be over. We will go back to the relationships where the f ixed coefficients, the NAIRU, and all the other factors that are being overridden by this variable com e back into place. 3/30/99 58 We have not reached that point yet. At the m oment, if we want to look at the evidence both anecdotally and in the security analysts’ forecasts, March is virtually unchanged from  February. We may be seei ng the beginning of the topping-out process, but it follows a very sharp acceleration. Nonetheless, I think we are confronted with the fact that labor m arkets are very taut. Initial claim s are unbelievable. The tightness in the First District is being restricted by a lack of workers. And I dare say that is probably true in one way or another throughout the w hole country. We may at som e point soon begin to see the wage acceleration, but we are not yet at the point where inflation is beginning to m ove in the pipeline. While I think it is exceptionally likely that the next m ove the Com mittee will be m aking will be on the upside, I do think--with inf lation ef fectively at zero and with no evidence yet that the acceleration in productivity has com e to an end--that we have tim e. Indeed, if this acceleration in productivity continues, I believe we are going to start to see prices falling, although that would not be defla tion in the usual sense of things im ploding. As a consequence, even though in one sense I feel inclined toward asym metry toward tightening because I think that is the likely direction of our next m ove, I am  a little concerned about adopting an asym metric directive today. I am assum ing that we will choose not to m ove, which is what I generally heard in the com ments around this table this m orning. I would be disinclined to m ove toward asym metry if for no other reason than I think, were we to do that, that we would have to announce it. I agree with Mike Kelley; I am  getting very queasy about this Kosovo war. I see potential dangers here. The antiseptic wars that we have been experiencing--the Gulf W ar and the m ore recent air attacks on Iraq and Serbia--have given us, I think, a m istaken view of what war is. We are m oving very quickly toward using Am erican ground troops in Kosovo. The situation is getting scarier and scarier. As Mike Kelley points out, if there were any urgency about m oving toward a firming at this stage, I would say we would have no choice. We would just do what we have to do. But considering that we do have som e time and flexibility, I would 3/30/99 59 recom mend that we stay where we are at this point both with respect to m oving interest rates and with respect to rem aining neutral on sym metry. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Ch airman, I not only support but applaud your recom mendation. I think an announcem ent of a tightening in policy at the present tim e would m ake us seem  oblivious of what is going on in the world. But perhaps even m ore seriously, with a com plete absence of inflation, it would put the Com mittee on record as being opposed to econom ic growth. Inevitably that is how a tightening m ove would be perceived, and I don’t think that would be an appropriate message for us to send. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, if I were a voting m ember I would, with respect, dissent from  your recom mendation. I want to explain why. First of all, I believe the appropriate inflation goal, properly m easured, is zero in principle. As I translate that into price indexes, it gives m e a CPI som ewhere in the area of 1 or 1½ percent, given the ambiguity of the reading that we are getting out of the chained price index. So if we stated the target as a CPI of 1½ percent, plus or m inus 1 percentage point, it seem s to m e that we are already at the upper end of that range and probably heading a little higher. Secondly, in the absence of the credit m arket disturbances last fall, m ost of which have dissipated, I think it is very unlikely that we would have cut rates then. So now that the monetary policy back on course. Thirdly, I think the balance of the risks is on the upside. I would illustrate that point by com paring the f ollowing two options: One option is to raise rates now and have it turn out ex post not to have been necessary; the other option is to hold rates steady now and have it turn out after the fact that we should have tightened. I would m uch rather deal with the form er situation than the latter because I believe it would be m uch easier to reverse a tightening than to have to catch up if it turns out that we are behind. I absolutely agree with you that if we have a tilt in the directive, it ought to be disclosed given the changed announcem ent policy. If the inform ation regarding the tilt 3/30/99 60 were released six weeks from  now after our next FOMC m eeting, the m arket would be confused about what our new disclosure policy m eans. So, if we are going to have a tilt, we should disclose it. And that, I think, is a good reason not to have a tilt. I also believe that at present we have as good an opportunity as we are ever going to have to em phasize that our objective is low inflation and not an attem pt to control the rate of growth of GDP or the unem ploym ent rate. I say that because there is a widespread expectation that the increase in oil prices will lead to an increase in the price indexes in the m onths ahead. Whether that m eans that we should act now or wait until we actually see that in the price indexes is a m atter for discussion. I think it would be better to act ahead of tim e before we see it in the indexes. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. I support “B” sym metric. I don’t think there has been enough of a change since the last FOMC m eeting to warrant a change in our basic directive. As far as what we stand for, I don’t think our prim ary objective is zero inflation. In my view, our prim ary objective is m aximum sustainable growth, and low inflation is sim ply a means to that end. Therefore, I think we need to see som ething in the pipeline, even very prelim inarily, that suggests that the econom y is beginning to experience a buildup in inflationary pressures that puts sustainable ec onom ic growth in jeopardy. Or we need to see som ething, even if it is very prelim inary, that suggests that we have the beginning of boom  conditions. Neither strong growth alone nor a low unem ploym ent rate alone is a reason to tighten m onetary policy. So, I favor steady as she goes. Our next m ove m ay indeed be a m ove to tighten. But that in and of itself doesn’t justify a change from  “B” symmetric at this point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, m y views on policy are related to a couple of the points I m ade earlier in the econom ic go-around. First, as the Greenbook indicates and as you have stated very eloquently, we are looking at an acceleration of productivity in this country. If that is true, that im plies an increase in real interest rates. That is not antigrowth; that is just the way the m acro econom y works, as I understand it. And I 3/30/99 61 worry that if we fail to validate that increase, we risk over-stim ulating the econom y and eventually producing inflation. Secondly, whereas the increase in the trade deficit last year reflected widespread weakness abroad, it seem s to m e more likely that an increase this year could reflect excessive dom estic dem and in the U.S. econom y, which could lead to a depreciation of the dollar and inflationary im pulses from  that direction. What worries m e the m ost, ironically, is that our high credibility m ay in som e sense be perm itting us to delay confronting this inflation risk. But if things ever begin to go in the other direction, I think they could unravel very quickly. So, as I said at the last m eeting, I think it is tim e for us to get back in the ball gam e. In my view, a step toward an asym metric directive would be a good way to do that. I hear your com ment about Kosovo. I don’t know exactly how to read that in the sense that I think, as you suggested, it is likely to be a lengthy conflict. And it is a very dangerous situation. But the longer we wait, the m ore difficult it will be to m ove. It seem s to m e that we m ight want to try to preem pt that problem  by m oving sooner rather than later. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, I basically agree with your recom mendation. I am som ewhat m ore inclined to favor the adoption of an asym metric directive to the upside. But, quite frankly, there does not seem  to be m uch risk in waiting to see how events unfold between now and the next m eeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Mr. Chairm an, based on our discussion today, the m ost serious concern is the inflation outlook for the year 2000. Our current policy stance is too expansionary relative to the acceleration in inflation projected in the Greenbook and in our outlook as well. I don’t think it is im portant to shift policy now but if we accept these inflation forecasts, then it will be im portant to increase rates later this year. The key, of course, is whether we accept these forecasts, and we have had a lot of discussion about that. Given the fact that we have very  low inflation rates now, I agree that we have 3/30/99 62 to see som e indication of wage increases or price inflation or inflation in the pipeline before we would want to take som e action. In this environm ent, it is im portant that we not becom e com placent about our current econom ic good fortune. But I agree with your recom mendation on both counts--on m aintaining the current funds rate objective and also the sym metric directive. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. I support your recom mendation of “B” sym metric. I will elaborate very briefly by saying that if I were a betting m an, given initial conditions, I would bet that our next m ove is m ore likely to be an increase in the federal funds rate than a decrease. But I don’t have any conviction about its tim ing and I don’t see anything significant to be gained by adopting an asym metric directive now or by becom ing m ore aggressive now. So I am  com fortable with your recom mendation. I would add, with regard to the actions we took last fall to reduce the funds rate, that nothing I have seen in subsequent developm ents has led m e to believe that things have gone wrong in the wake of those actions. So I see no reason to want to undo them  at this point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairm an, as is evident from  my com ments during the earlier go-around, I am  a little less com fortable with waiting to have obvious inflation “in our faces,” as the teenagers say, and I am  perhaps at least a bit m ore inclined to support forward-looking and preem ptive policym aking. Having said that, if I had a vote this year, I would support your recom mendation today because I don’t think the case for a move is com pelling, or at least com pelling enough. That said, I am  going to continue to worry and try to weigh the consequences of  erring on both sides of  what will turn out after the fact to have been the optim al policy. I think there is a chance that we are underestim ating the im portance of good policy and the payback from  the low inflation expectations that we have helped engender in this current policy environm ent. And I hope we will continue to stay extrem ely alert and be willing to revisit this issue if the need for tightening becom es more obvious. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. 3/30/99 63

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I support your recom mendation for “B” sym metric. I am asym metric in m y head but, as long as there is the luxury of time, I think we can afford to m ove against an acceleration of inflation or super rapid econom ic growth when we see it. Otherwise, I don’t think we should act because we are sure to be m isinterpreted. While I do think we have the luxury of tim e, I will also say that it m ay be necessary to m ove sharply later, and we should recognize that as well. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I agree with your position on policy, Mr. Chairm an. I might be a little m ore com fortable with an asym metric as opposed to a sym metric directive, but if I had a vote, I probably could live with a sym metric directive as well. For som e time I have been concerned about what I referred to in m y com ments earlier as a party building up again, as it clearly was at this tim e last year. I think the stance of policy is contributing to that. I don’t think we are seeing the party as m uch as we m ay ultim ately see it in the real estate m arkets, but we certainly are seeing it in other asset m arkets. The price-earnings ratios m ay be appropriate because they do reflect expectations of a better return on capital going forward than we have had in the past, and that m ay have to do with m ajor changes in productivity. I am a bit agnostic about all of that. But I think it is possible that we will have significant problem s with our econom y working itself up higher and higher without seeing signs of infl ation, so that ultim ately when conditions do change--either we tighten or som ething else happens--the fall m ay be a lot farther than we would otherwise experience. We saw that in Japan. We are not like Japan; a lot of things separate us, not the least of which is the health of the financial sector in our econom y versus the Japanese situation. But I think there are som e lessons to be learned from  the Japanese experience. Also, with regard to your com ments about Kosovo, I think the rest of the world is looking to us for leadership. That leadership goes to our stance on the econom y broadly speaking, with respect to financial m arkets as well as everything else. And in that regard I would opt, actually, for a m ore conservative rather than a less conservative 3/30/99 64 position, given what is going on in the rest of the world. So, as I said, I can live with your recom mendation for now. I just hope we have our eye on the ball and don’t wait until we see significant signs of inflation before  we decide to m ove, because at that point it might well be too late. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I support both halves of your recom mendation. I think we are struggling with an im portant issue: Do we act based on forecasts or do we, as Don Kohn said in his statem ent, look for evidence in the incom ing data? In part the challenge is that since the forecasts have been inaccurate, we are forced to look m ore and m ore at the incom ing data. As you indicate, the incom ing data do not show even the earliest buildup of inflation. If they did, we should act. In som e sense what we are trying to understand in this econom y is: W hat is its m aximum sustainable growth? We aren’t really sure. So, since there is very little pressure on inf lation now or in the pipeline, and since we haven’t in any sense prepared the m arkets for a policy m ove in a way that would avoid an adverse m arket reaction--including a m ove to asym metry which, if we m ade one, I think we should announce--I believe the m ore prudent action at this stage is to wait and see. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I can support your recom mendation for no change in the federal funds rate target today. In my view, however, m onetary policy should be biased toward tightening going forward. Let m e explain why and then confront the issue of whether or not a m ove to an asym metric bias should be m ade and announced at this m eeting. I think there are three im portant considerations that relate to possible adjustm ents in m onetary policy in the period ahead. First, there is the reassessm ent issue, which the Chairm an articulated very clearly in his Hum phrey-Hawkins testim ony. That is, given what I see as an im provem ent in financial m arket conditions and given a significant upward revision in our forecast com pared to what it was at the tim e we 3/30/99 65 implem ented the recent easing, we need to reassess whether the full am ount of that easing is still justif ied. Second, and here is where I place m ost of m y em phasis, there is the question of how policy should respond to developm ents going forward, specifically to changes in the unem ploym ent rate and inflation. I suggested at the last m eeting that we follow a strategy that I call an increm ental asym metric Taylor rule. This is a policy that is not forward-looking but reactive; it responds not onl y to changes in inflation, but also to changes in the unem ploym ent rate. Following the strategy would entail raising the real federal funds rate in response to declines in the unem ploym ent rate and to increases in inflation. Based on the staff forecast, following such a strategy would indeed result in an increase in the federal funds rate over the next year. Third, there is the question of how m onetary policy should respond if there is in fact an acceleration in productivity growth under way. This is an issue that the staff has addressed recently and that President Broaddus talked about today. I think the conclusion that we reached in that analysis is that such acceleration in productivity growth raises the equilibrium  real interest rate of the econom y and requires, in order to maintain an unchanged stance of m onetary policy, an increase in the real federal funds rate. Governor Kelley along with the Chairm an m ade a persuasive case, nevertheless, for not changing the policy bias at this m eeting given prevailing international tensions and the prospect that the first announcem ent of such a change in the tilt could produce a particularly large financial m arket response. So I can accept the Chairm an’s recom mendation for continuing the sym metric posture under these circum stances with the understanding, as I’m  sure we all agree, that this is no obstacle to changing policy going forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Rivlin. 

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN. I also concur in your recom mendation, Mr. Chairm an. I don’t see any evidence that inflation is a clear and present danger in the United States at the moment. I concur with Ed Boehne and others that what we really should be focused on is 3/30/99 66 maximizing sustainable growth. We don’t know exactly what that is. And I am unconvinced that at the m oment we are operating at a rate which is unsustainably high or that we will be in the near future. I see risks on both sides. I concur with your feeling that Kosovo introduces m ore uncertainty, although it is not clear which way the risks would cut. I also see plenty of tim e for action if we turn out to be wrong. So I would stay where we are. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I agree with what Bill McDonough said at the outset: It is highly likely that if we were to take a firm ing action today, it would be interpreted in view of the strong growth num bers as being antigrowth, and that would be very undesirable. It is al so true, in view of the stock m arket finally closing above 10,000 yesterday, that a tightening step could easily be interpreted-­unfortunately, and in m y view wrongly--tha t we considered that undesirable and we reacted to it. What is troubling about that is that it leads to the im plication that we have to wait until growth slows sharply and the stock m arket drops and then it will be saf e to raise rates. [Laughter] I don’t know how to get out of this box because, certainly, once the need for a m ove is obvious it is too late. It is easy for m onetary policy steps to be taken when it is obvious to everybody that they are appropriate. I believe, however, that some of our greatest successes in the past have occurred when we were willing to take actions that were not, in fact, obvious to everybody. If my memory is right, our May FOMC m eeting will m ark the second anniversary of our looking at dom estic conditions and forecasts of the future, taking account of our concerns and the lags and saying: W ell, we probably should m ove in an anticipatory or preem ptive way, but there are certain external reasons for not doing so. Since then we have had a whole succession of reasons. Sometimes they have been compelling--for exam ple, in the fall of 1997 and even last fall when the newsletters were full of stories about how the Asian crisis was going to bite us if we waited just a little longer. 3/30/99 67 We have had som e discussions around this table in the past about the partial analysis of  the negative im pulses and the partial analysis of  the positive im pulses affecting the U.S. econom y com ing from  events abroad. It is very difficult to net these factors out. But it is hard for m e to im agine that the econom y today in the United States would be even stronger had these events not happened. So it is easier to com e to the conclusion that the netting would lead to the view that we have had m ore beneficial than adverse consequences, though certainly not every sector or industry would agree with that. But we cannot live on just-in-tim e crises around the world to sustain this econom y. At som e point the effects on our econom y have to com e from  internal decisions. I don’t believe that recessions are caused by the econom y running out of gas, with dem and just drying up for lack of stim ulus. Rather, I believe they are caused by the kinds of conditions that Japan created for itself: Dram atically expanding dom estic industrial capacity far beyond the ability to absorb it internally and creating conditions in its financial sector that they have been trying to work off for a decade. If we get to a point where we have to have a protracted pe riod of no growth or a contraction, it will be because we have overstim ulated on the front end, not because we ran out of stim ulus to demand.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I support your recom mendation and I agree with it in both respects. At our last m eeting we voted for no change and a sym metric directive. As I indicated earlier, two m onths of statistics have com e in since then. They continue to show em ploym ent growth, a low unem ploym ent rate, very strong output growth, and contem porary m easures of inflation that are flat, with no inflation in the pipeline. So I agree with Bill McDonough that if we were either to tighten or adopt an asym metric directive toward tightening, we would be interpreted as being antigrowth and probably rightfully so. I don’t think that is the way we should be perceived. So I agree with your recom mendation. 3/30/99 68 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, understanding the difficulties of these an unwinding of the actions that we took in the m idst of the crisis last fall. Last sum mer we were continuing to experience strong growth in econom ic activity and jobs. We took some easing actions because of the Asian crisis. We introduced additional stim ulus into this econom y, which is playing out now. I think we could legitim ately and forthrightly explain a tightening m ove as an unwinding of those earlier actions; that would m ake it more acceptable. In the long term  such an action would be healthy. Having said that, I would m ake the directive sym metric if the Com mittee adopts a no-change policy, as it appears it m ight, because we probably will not act during the interm eeting period and I don’t think we should suggest otherwise. So m y preference is to unwind. However, if we don’t, I would not have an asym metric directive. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. The m ajority of the voting members appears to favor “B” sym metric. Could you read the directive, including the change that has been recom mended in the general paragraphs? 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD. I will begin with that, Mr. Chairm an. There is a change in the very first sentence of the general paragraphs. Basically, it involves dropping the words “has m oderated.” So the first sentence would read: “The inform ation reviewed at this m eeting suggests that the expansion in econom ic activity is still robust.” Moving on to the operational paragraph, the draft language is shown on page 13 of the Bluebook. It would read: “To prom ote the Com mittee’s long-run objectives of  price stability and sustainable econom ic growth, the Com mittee in the im mediate future seeks conditions in reserve m arkets consistent with m aintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 4¾ percent. In view of the evidence currently available, the Com mittee believes that prospective developm ents are equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease in the federal funds rate operating objective during the interm eeting period.”
