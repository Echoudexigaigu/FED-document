CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Who would lik e to m ove to approve the m inutes of the March m eeting? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOU GH. So m ove. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objec tion they are approved. Mr. Fisher, you have the floor. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Thank you. I will b e referring to the packag e of charts in f ront of you.1/ I will b e discussing th ree distinct to pics th is morning: first, recen t interest rate and exchange rate deve lopm ents; second, the recent behavior of the funds rate and Desk opera tions; and third, som e prelim inary thoughts about the Y2K issues the Desk m ay be facing. Turning to the first chart on fo rward rate contracts for 3-m onth deposits, you can see in the top panel tha t after the las t meeting U.S. forward rate s drif ted lowe r and then began rising, intriguingly, from  about the tim e of the European Central Bank (ECB) rate cut. Subsequently, they rose sign ificantly f urther after the rel ease of the first-quarter GDP data and the Chairm an’s May 6 rem arks in Chicago. Of course, last F riday the CPI data caused an even bigger jum p in the forward rates, with the 9-m onth forward 3-month rate backing up 21 ba sis points to 5.51 percent and the 3-month for ward rate backing up 10 basis points to 5.18 percent. The percent and the long bond backed  up 17 basis points to around 5.92 percent. In the m iddle panel you can see that the ECB m anaged to surprise the your last m eeting. And forward rates have shifted  lower m ore recen tly, with the 3-month forward 3-m onth rate  right on top of the current 3-m onth rate. The bottom  panel shows rate m ovements in Japan. While a few brave souls were suggesting a few week s ago that there m ay be evidence of a reviving Japanese econo my--the Wall Street Journal,  for exam ple, brought out the old hackneyed story a bout a rise in golf club m emberships --there are no such signs in the forward interest rate m arket. Looking at interest rate m arkets, it is hard not to notice that at th is poin t, almost 1 / A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Fi sher is appended to the transcript. 5/18/99 2 halfway through the year, the U.S. ec onom y seems to be chugging right along, while the rest of the wo rld is at best sluggish. Turning to the second page, the t op panel shows selected 3-month deposit rates in term s of t he change in basis points from  January 4 and the bottom  panel shows the percentage change in various currencies against the dollar, indexed to January 4. Without going through all the details--the specifics are covered in our written report--twelve central banks have cut rates since your last m eeting, six of th em more than once. As you can see, much of the world has declining 3- month rates and d eclin ing curren cies relative to th e dolla r. But as can b e seen clearly in the bottom panel, two interesting exception s are Mexico an d Canada, whose currencies have been strengthening against the dollar. However, it m ay be worth considering the possibility that the w eakening of our exchange rate with our North Am erican counterparts could reflect the strength of the U.S. econom y and its spillover to the north and to the south. The charts on the third page disp lay changes in the Treasury yield curve over the las t two y ears. The top panel shows rates for on-the-run coupon securities from  May 1, 1997 through May 14, 1999 and the bottom panel depicts selected yield curves. Again, as a consequence of the CPI release last Friday, you can see that the long end of the on-the-run curve has backed up to about where it was a y ear ago. That backup is a little hard to see in the top panel becau se of the brownish-orange v ertical lin e, but the bottom panel shows it m ore clearly; the yield on the 30-year bond rose to 5.91 percent and the 10-year ra te went to 5.61 percent. But it is worth pointing out in the m icro picture of the last few days that the 30-year bond had backed up--you cannot see it in this scale--to 5.86 percent on Wednesday in anticipation of  the PPI num bers to be released on Thursday. Those data gave the m arket som ething of a pleasant surprise and the bond closed Thursday at 5.75 percent. So the m arket had been bracing itself for a negative inflation s hock, got a head fake from  the PPI numbers Thursday, and then got fake d out again Friday. This m orning, the long bond is actually trading at 5.87 percent, only 1 basis point higher than the close on W ednesday. It cert ainly was a big m ove, but it is worth noting that som e of it had already occurred, was taken away, and then given back. Of the four yield curves shown in  the bottom  panel, the steep est was on May 1, 1997, which is before any of the pressures developed in Thailand. The panel also depicts the rather flat yield curve of May 1998, the inverted curve of last October, and last Friday’s yield curve. The floating diamonds reflect the twice o ff-the-run 30-year bond yield, which I have noted there as a placeholder. I think of that rate as providing something of a crude m easure of m arket uncertainty about the level of long-term  rates. Which way to look at  the liquidity prem ium is som ething 5/18/99 3 worth pondering. To anticipate what the Chairm an m ay ask me after m y remarks: Yes, bid/ask spreads on both on-the-run and off-the-run securities are a good bit wider today than they were at the time of your last meeting. They had com e in a little further by the end of April, but the noise of the last few days has m oved them  out a bit. Turning to open m arket operations, the top chart on page 4 shows the trading range of the funds rate over the last four m aintenance periods. As shown in the upper left portion, coveri ng the first m aintenance period from get th rough the quarter-end and m onth-end period , but we faced fairly typical pressures for such a period. However, the intriguing interval was the second period, depicted in the uppe r right portion of the chart, when we never quite appreciated the speed w ith which banks shifted to a desire to be on the short side of m eeting th eir reserve requirem ents. You can see there how softly the funds  rate traded over the period, when we supplied only $900 million of excess reserves on average. Initially, lower-than-expected tax receipts through most of April were a contributing factor, as receipts lagged our daily estim ates. They caught up at the end of the month, leaving the m arket in itially in the next period with higher reserve levels than we intended. There also seem s to have been some hangover effect from  last year when we had a very soft funds rate. To bring pricing back in line, we le ft excess reserves in rather short supply at the start of the Apr il 22 m aintenance period, which was compounde d by a bit of a m iss and gave us a rather firm  market on April 26 with a standard deviation of 197 basi s points. That did seem to shock the m arket back to a trad ing level a li ttle clos er to the target. But, again, we have seen som e oscillation. Yesterday’s fund s market was a bit firm er than we had hoped, but rath er typical for a quarter ly refunding day; the effective rate was around 5.01 percent. The average rate for the period w e are in now is still just 4.76 percent, including yesterday’s firm rate. Turning to the next page, I’ve pr ovided a quick summ ary so you can see that this year’s tax season was roughly sim ilar to last year’s tax season. The blue dots represent 1998 and the red dots 1999. Funds have traded around zero for the effective rate m inus the target rate, as is evident by the cluster of dots near zero on the ver tical axis showing the standard deviation. If you look rather carefully --perhaps if you squint--you can see that the softness of last year was not entirely repeated. The shorthand way to see that is  to note that there are s lightly m ore red dots than blue dots to the right of the zero, i.e. on the firm er side. But the pattern w as roughly similar to last year’s. Let m e mention a few other issues regarding our open m arket operations. We comm enced the securi ties lending program  on April 26. 5/18/99 4 Since then we have lent securities on 16 different days, and on 5 occasio ns we had overbidding in the 30-year bond, beyond our lending lim it of 25 percent of our holdings. There were also 3 occasions when we had m ore bids than we needed in the 10-year  area. There were 4 days of no borrowing. Interestingly, on 8 days we  lent bills and coupons that were not being actively traded. I view that  as a very good sign for the program --that it really involved securities loan s that were very close to m aturity and m ight have led to fails; so, that was very helpful. Let me be clear that I think this program  is going well. As I mentioned last tim e, I am  likely to want to raise the lim its at som e point  in the future, but before doing so I will com plete a m ore thorough analy sis of our ex perien ce with the program , which I will share with the Comm ittee and the Treasury. In our outright operations since your last m eeting, we added a net of $11.74 billion to the SOMA portfolio in  16 different pass operations over 12 different days. We did a TIPS pass where we purchased $ 303 m illion of inflation-indexed securities agains t bids by the dealers of $3.9 billion. The reaction  to our purchases in the TIPS m arket was very muted. I would note that currency in circulation has been growing m ore rapidly this year than last year, which explains in part the extent of our outright operations through April. The currency com ponent of M1 has grown at an average annual m onthly rate of 10.9 percent versus 6.7 percent last year. For the com ing interm eeting period, we are now forecasting a $9.9 billio n growth in curren cy as opposed to $ 5.3 billion over the same period last year. A num ber of you have asked m e abou t our prelim inary thinking at the Desk on Y2K issues. I thought it would be helpf ul to share with you som e thoughts on this, but I want to be clear that these are very prelim inary views. I am not comm itted to the se ideas, but it m ight be helpf ul to take you through them , even though I am  not looking for approval or concurrence at this tim e. If you turn to the next page, I have listed som e of our prelim inary thoughts on this subject. First and m ost im portantly, I think there is an increased lik elihood that later in th e year th e Desk  will be operating on both sides of  the m arket, alternately adding and draining reserves in any given period  of tim e. Secondly, th e Special Len ding Facility  that the Board addre ssed yesterd ay, if used a s intend ed, will prov ide a m eans f or the System ’s balance sh eet to expan d as we lend to sm all banks, who m ay be perceived to be less well prepared  than the large banks to handle any Y2K problem s. Small banks m ay lose  deposits either through outright withdrawals or transfers of deposits to  larger banks that are perceived to be better prepared. 5/18/99 5 Now, the large banks m ay not be comfortable with either holding high levels of excess reserv es or recycling deposits back to lesser credits. This could lead to a tiering in the fu nds m arket, with the Sys tem acting as an interm ediary--providing added rese rves to the sm all banks through the Special Len ding Facility  and perhaps  needing to drain r eserves from the large banks. Thus, the System ’s balance sheet may expand through the use of the Special Lending Facility as well as through our outright and longer-term  repo operations. We are likely to need to fine-tune m ore frequently, alternating the use of re pos and m atched sale transactions. Perhaps the sim plest way to put th is is just that we m ay have greater uncertainty ; and in a pe riod of greater uncertainty, the Desk is likely to need to be on both sides of the m arket. A separate and m uch narrower issue is  that as we approach th e year-end, if there appears to be a developing scarcity of collateral, as som e fear, we m ay be inclined to oversupply rese rves intentionally early on with term repos. Then we can fine-tune total reserves over the turn of the year through m atched sale draining operations , where we provide the collateral; thus we would not be dependent on the securities  markets to come forward with the co llateral for ou r operations. Also, we are giving som e consideration to the need for late-day operations. We are still thinking this  through, but we think w e might need to conduct som e operations late in the day; otherwise there m ight be pressure around the tim e of the regular 3 p.m . close of the securities wire. To drain reserves, we m ight do m atched sales late in the day, though we would have to find som e means of cred iting the c ollateral to the deale rs’ accounts after what would be the norm al close of the wire. To add reserves, we are giving som e consider ation to the use of a third-party custodian--really just Ch ase and Ba nk of New York who could act as custodial ag ents for us--in the accepta nce of certain types of collateral. The Desk’s system s simply are no t geared up to take som e form s of colla teral that in f act are  eligible for use in our operations. Finally, the next page is a chart of the year -end b utterfly trad e for 1999/2000, the red line, and for the prev ious three year-end periods. The difference b etween the y ields on the 3-m onth De cember Eurodollar contract against the average of th e two surrounding contracts is an expression of year-end funding anxi ety. You can see the rather extrao rdina ry levels to w hich tha t differential rose over this past year-end and early this year. It has com e off quite a b it since then. While it was trading at th e higher lev els, we gave som e consideration to the question of how we m ight respond, if you wished us to, to anticipated year-end pressures in the funding m arket. The onl y tool that we have in our arsenal now would be a forward RP--to inject reserves by doing forward RPs that the dealers m ight execute with us. I have to say that gives me som e paus e 5/18/99 6 in term s of putting on ou r books operations  that m ay not be necessary. It seem s to m e to be a less- than-op timal approach. Conceptually, a tidier tool would be the use of options: We would sell options on both repo and matched sale trans action s at strik e prices ou t from the Comm ittee’s ta rget and allow the dealers to bid for those as a way of getting assurance that year-end financing would be available. I want to repea t that this is rea lly a conceptual issue regarding how we might respond if this prem ium began to rise again and the Committee were concerned about funding in the year-end m arket. That is really all I can say at this point on thes e Y2K issues that a num ber of you have asked m e about. I hope this gives you a sense of our thinking on the subject. In conclusion, Mr. Chairm an, we  had no foreign operations during the per iod but I will nee d the Com mittee’s ratif ication of  our dom estic operations. I have a s eparate issu e to bring before the Comm ittee about the renewal of our Mexican and Canadian  swap lines. I sent a m emo to the Comm ittee explainin g that the ap propriate tim ing for a vote on that is now rather than later in the year. So, I will also n eed a vote o n that issue. I would be happy to take questions on any aspect of m y report, and then, as you wish, we could take the two votes separately. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Peter, in the ev ent, a low prob ability even t, of very significant runs on sm aller banks for cu rrency withdrawals or deposit transfers, do those banks have enough collate ral to com e to the discount window and liquefy the asset side of their balance sheets  to weather that drain? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I would not consider m yself the System ’s leading expert on the subject. I think they have collateral. At the discount window we can take pretty m uch anything they have in term s of custom er notes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I know we can  do that, but I am wondering what they have. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Well, if your question re lates to what collat eral we currently have in our possession, I should not e that we also take on-site collateral in som e cases. The discount officers have been working on th is issue, writin g letters enc ouraging the banks to get their collateral in and pledge it, but we are not there yet. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Suppose a bank holds a note of a long-term friend of the bank’s president, which is  10 percent of the asset side of the balan ce shee t. Let’s say everything about the loan looks f ine: It’s a perform ing loan and the bank itself is perfectly co mfortable with i t; indeed , it is a te rrific loan. Can we accept that? 5/18/99 7 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Yes, with a haircut. If it’s a loan, there is a haircut be cause  it is not m arketable and is therefore hard to value.  And there ’s a further ha ircut if it is a lo ng-term loan. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Now the pr emise changes and the good friend of the pres ident of the bank  is in ev ident difficulty, not in servicing th e loan but in repaying it at the end of its term . What is the point at which we effectively throw these people into bankruptcy? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. That is the issue that I think the most thoughtf ul institutions in the m arket are anxious about in terms of Y2K concerns: What will be good business practice with regard to closing out counterpa rties?  How m any grace day s are going to be appropriate ? Will this b e a one-day hurric ane an d then eve rything will be  back to norm al, or will it be so mething m ore than th at? Swap agreem ents have three d ays, repo agreem ents have two days; a grace period is written into the contracts. So having the loan as co llateral makes things a bit e asier, but there are a huge number of instrum ents out there that are on what m ight be considered hair triggers. It is a very awkward subject, and not jus t for us. We will be pa rt of a larg er community that will be g rappling with that question. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. But we are the only lender of last resort. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Absolutely. But if you think of banks as big as Chase or Citibank, it’s a virtual certainty th at some of their custom ers will have co mputer problem s. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think our supervisors would be looking at the funda mental soundness of those custom ers and whether the li quidity problem  is a short-term  or a long-term problem. I thought your question had to do  with whether this particular customer might be in a dif ficult lo ng-term  situation so the viability -­

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I am concerned about our being in a position where we are unprepared to m ake judgm ents on which banks we effectively will shut down because we are no t going to accept th eir paper at the discount wind ow and by definition there is no other lender of last resort. 5/18/99 8 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Our supervisory people are working very closel y with the o ther supervisory authorities through the F FIEC to m ake sure that the lines of communication are open and that thought has been given to thes e very points in advance of the year-end. So it is very much on the agenda of the c ontingency planners. I don’t know if that provides any comfort, but people are thinki ng about precisely the issue you’ve raised. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Communicati on is fine. But suppose somebody at the other end of the line says : “Hey, I am  drowni ng. What are you going to do for m e?” 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Well, I would point out th at in the m iddle 1980s in Chicago and through the late 1980s and early 1990s in New England and T exas, we m ade huge volum es of l oans to banks that had a lot of bad assets without ever im pairing our collateral position. For most ba nks, if we look hard at the assets they have, I think we can get enough collateral for com fort. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think that is  the judgm ent we have to m ake. All I am suggesting is that w e try to m ake it in advance. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. That is why, as Peter noted, we are urging very strongly that banks come in ahead of  time to pre-pos ition colla teral and talk to th e discoun t officers. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Mr. Chairm an, Don is correct that we are doing that. The discount officers are urging both sm all banks and large banks to have their borrowing docum ents up-to-date an d their collateral in place ahead of tim e. But given the num ber of people involved and the speed with which this is happening, it seem s clear that m any banks are not going to have done this in advan ce. So there will be a lot of last m inute scurrying around. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. We can m ake a judgm ent as to whether we are looking at a system ic risk, in which case we can act under certain provisions specified in the Federal Reserve Act. But what do we do if the risk is not obviously system ic but a very sign ificant prob lem for, say, Texas or som e other a rea wh ere th ere is a  multitude o f small banks? 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Don, are banks executing all-asset pledges?  Isn’t that a way to--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I am not sure, Bob. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. We have done that in the past. 5/18/99 9 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. We have done that with banks. The Bank of New York is a classic exam ple where we took the building, the furnitu re, virtually everything as collateral. In this case, we have the complicat ion of the Hom e Loan Banks. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I think we did som e variant of that for smaller institutions at the tim e of the New England banking crisis. We can do these things fairly fast but it is hard to do s o for multiple institu tions fairly f ast. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. But there is a problem with the Federal Home Loan Banks. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Right. We are working on that. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. The other issue we have  been tracking on a m onthly basis is how m any banks versus how m any thrifts ha ve filed their docum entation and pledged collateral. We are at close to 70 percent on the banks. The thrifts are the concern. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I have a very quick comm ent. My im pression is that a lot of the small institu tions are not setting up lines w ith us because they are assum ing that the Hom e Loan Banks will p rovide the liquidity. It is not obvious  to m e that the Hom e Loan Banks know where they are going to  get their liquidity. So I w ould think that’s a critical point to straighten out with the Hom e Loan Ba nk System . We need to m ake sure that we somehow either backstop that system  or that  they tell their ban ks in no unc ertain terms what those lines are go ing to be. That will f orce the sm aller b anks to se t up arrang ements with us. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If we backst op tha t system , it will be d ifficult to unwind it because th ey are going to  want to keep  it in p lace. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I agree w ith that. That is  why I think we m ight be able to get them  to be more explicit about how much th ey will be ab le to provid e through their own resourc es so that the ban ks will r ealize tha t they must backstop them selves with us. In my conversations with sm all banks, there is th is presum ption that it is all taken care of and that their Hom e Loan Bank will take care of them . I don’t th ink they  have really thought that through. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Certainly not on the cash side. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Vice Chairm an. 5/18/99 10 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. The Hom e Loan Banks put out a statem ent, over the week end I believ e, which I read as saying : We will ta ke care of  all the banks w e deal with but m aybe we won’t, so then you will have to  go to the Fed. That puts us in an untenable position. We have to  increase the pressure as we get into the summer because we really cannot wait until th e last days of Decem ber and have som e banks that have been asleep all year wake up and decide they have a problem . I think we have to be b anging on th eir doors or banging on th eir heads, if necessar y, to bring this to their attention. We also have an issue regarding the larg e banks that will be  the recipients of large flows of funds. Some of the m are ge tting v ery concern ed about th e flows gettin g so large that th ey could bec ome less tha n well cap italized. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. We h ave that worry, too. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. I think we  have to find a way consistent with our regulations that allows the banks to  do exactly what we want them do to--that is, to bring in the funds and recycle them even  though they will blow up their balance sheets as a result. Work is going on in the Syst em now on how to handle that problem . 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Any further questions on open m arket operations? If not, who would like to m ove to  ratify the domestic tr ansac tions ? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOU GH. So m ove. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objec tion they are approved. Mr. Fisher, you wanted to discuss our swap arrangem ents with Canada and Mexico. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, I sent the Comm ittee a m emo on May 13 about the renewal of our swap arrangem ents with Mexico and Canada that were esta blished under the N orth American Fram ework Agreem ent. A reading of the fine print--indeed Mr. Trum an’s reading of the fine print--m ade us realize th at under the term s of th ese swap arrangem ents 6 months’ notice is required to  term inate th em. Therefore, the appropriate tim e for t he Comm ittee to decide to renew or  not to renew them at year -end is now and not, as has been our custom , in Novem ber. Given som e of the Y2K issues as well as  the separatist issue still af oot in Canada, our counterparts in Mexico and C anada m ay be particularly anxious about them . So it is m y recommenda tion that the Committee vote to ren ew these two agreem ents a t this tim e. 5/18/99 11 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions for Peter?  If not, would som ebody like to move that? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Move  approval, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Is there a second? 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL. Second. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objec tion. Thank you very m uch. Let’s turn now to Mr. Prell. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The April Consum er Price Index, published the day after we printed the Greenbook, obviously is occupying center stage in the financia l markets and I would guess that it’s a pretty prom inent question m ark for m any of you today. But, before getting into the nuts and bolts of that  report and our interpretation, I’d like to say a few words about the broader aggregate dem and and supply setting. First, on the dem and side, the picture is  still one of strength overall. We think, however, that the first-quart er increase in real domestic final purchases of  7 percent greatly overst ates the underlying trends. A variety of transitory  factors com bined to boost outlays: the di p in inte rest rates las t fall, since reversed; the stepped-up incentives for auto-buyers, as GM drove to restore its m arket share; th e abnorm ally m ild winter weather; and so on. Given those considerations, it ’s quite reasonabl e to anticipate a noticeable slackening of expend iture growth this quarter. And the latest retail sales figur es support that assessm ent--although we didn’t realize it fully when we fini shed our forecast las t Thursday. The surprisingly large increase in goods pri ces in Friday’s CPI report im plied that the softening in real spending wa s even m ore m arked last m onth than we had thought on the basis of the nom inal retail sales data. If we’re right, real PCE growth in the current quarter will be som ewhere in the neighborhood of 4 percent, at an annu al rate--scarcely a weak num ber, but one that wo uld be at the low end of the range of recent quarters. Another area of deceleration in ou r forecast for the second q uarter is residential investm ent. Our thesis has been that, although the dem and for homes probably hasn’t fallen off m uch, builders would find it difficult-­perhaps pr actically im possible --to mainta in the s easonally ad justed leve l of starts they record ed during th e late fall and winter m onths. This morning’s report is consistent with that notion. Actually, single-fam ily starts fell m ore than we anticipate d, 11 percent; but, as we thought last month, the s ingle-fam ily perm its figures m ay be telling a m ore accurate story, having fallen about 4½ percent in March and anot her 3 percent in 5/18/99 12 The final m ajor elem ent of deceleration in spending this quarter is state and local purchases--e specially outlays for cons truction. In this case, we still have no useful data beyond March, but it just doesn’t seem plausib le to extrapo late the surge th at we saw this  winter. Unusually favorable w eather alm ost certain ly helped m ove building ahead of schedule, and som e reversi on to trend is to be exp ected in the near term . This is not to deny that the underlying  trend in public construction could be relativ ely steep a t this time. Am ong other things, the transportation bill passed last year is helping to spur ac tivity, and states and localities have been experiencing a bit o f a wealth effect them selves, as their revenues reflect, directly or i ndire ctly, the cap ital gains tax payers hav e been enjoying. The wealth effect rem ains central  to our projection of dom estic demand and econom ic activity through next  year. To be sure, we believe that waning accelerator effects should be a m oderating force with respect to houses, consum er durables, and business capital goods--and, as we noted in the Greenbook, one can discern some hints of this already in various categories of expe nditu re. But, if  the st ock m arket continues to soar, consu mers’ perce ptions of  their perm anent incom e will rise and so too will bu sinesses’ p erceptions of  their sa les prospects ; target leve ls of household and business investm ent goods will move still higher. So, th e fact that we’ve anticipate d that the market will peak soon is crucial to our predic tion th at GDP growth will moderate over the com ing year. As it is, the run-up in stock prices la st month prompted us to raise our forecast of d emand growth during the next  several quarters. However, this has shown through to ou tput rather than to prices because of the m ore favorable supply-side environm ent we  are now projecting. Perhaps m ost notably, we’ve raised our sights on the prospects for gains in labor productivity , and that h as perm itted us to raise p rojected output without commensurate increas es in pre ssures on labor m arkets. Our reassessm ent of the productiv ity outlook is yet one m ore in a sequence of adjustm ents we’ve m ade on the basis of incom ing data over the past few years. We’d prefer to re ly on deep analytical insights, but the fact is that the behavior of produc tivity is not well unde rstood, let alone readily predictable; if it were ot herwise, econom ists wouldn’t still be scratching their heads over the post- 1973 deterioration in the trend of econom ic growth. Consequently, we’ve had to feel our way on this. In our view, the pickup in output per hour over the past year or so has been greater than is likely attributab le sim ply to the rapid growth of output--the s o-called “cy clical” influ ence. Firm s do seem  to be achieving substantial structural gains in efficiency through technological 5/18/99 13 innovations, investm ents in m ore and better equipm ent, i mproved inform ation m anage ment, and reorganization of production and distribution processes. Given the continuing high level of investm ent and what we hear from  business peopl e about their ef forts to im prove productivity, there doesn’t appear to be any reason to anticipate that these gains will f all off markedly in th e near term --apart from  some tendency f or reductions in worker hours to lag th ose in output as the rate of GDP expansion slows. And even that cycli cal elem ent m ight be weaker th an in the past, given the heavier use of con tingent workers and the pressures on executives to deliver strong earning s quarter after quarter--except, I suppose, in the dot-com  sector. So, putting this all together, we’ve added several tenths to the rate of increase in output per hour through the year 2000. Obviously, the outlook f or productivity is a consideration in the near-term prospects for inflation. Among other things, the recent surge in productivity has helped boost profit m argins and thereby given firm s more room  to compete for m arket share without forgoin g acceptable rates of return on equity. Moreover, the comp ensation part of the unit labor cost ratio is also looking m ore favorable. Even taking the first-quarter ECI with a large grain of salt, we now have  som e evidence that, perhaps in part because of a lagged resp onse to th e lower pric e increas es of the past couple of years, nom inal pay gains are not m oving up--despite a tight labor m arket. These considerations encouraged us to take a sm idgen off our core inflation forecast--as did the surprisingly low price num bers through March. But, especially with o il prices and other “special factors” already, or expected soon to be, taking a turn for the worse, we’ve maintained our view tha t an unem ploym ent rate in the low 4s will in tim e prove incom patible with stable or declining inflation. The question is whether th e four-tenths leap in th e Apr il core CP I is telling u s that the da y of reckoning actually has arrived. We’re inclined to be fairly sanguine on this score at this point. In part, this is s imply because what we hear from  businesses do esn’t sugg est that there’s been anything approach ing a sea ch ange in the pric ing environm ent. But on the statistical si de, while it’s alm ost always possible to slice and dice th ese d ata to find s ome residua l that fits your priors, we think th ere are elem ents in the April CPI report that prov ide at least som e grounds for skepticism  that the burst in  the core index is truly a sign that the trend of inflation has now turned  upward. For exam ple, the sizab le incre ase in a pparel p rices merely rev ersed su rprisingly large d eclin es in the firs t quarter; we expected an o ffsetting firm ing of prices som ewhere along the line, and we may sim ply have m issed the tim ing. And the rebound in tobacco prices after som e discounting in March p robably is telling us little about fundam ental macro im balances in the econom y. Inciden tally, it’s p erhaps  worth notin g that, s etting aside tobacco prices, 5/18/99 14 which have risen 33 percent since last  April, the twelve-m onth change in the core CPI is the sam e as it was a y ear ago, even after we add back in the effects of the techn ical changes in th e index. All that said, though, we didn’t anti cipate the outsized  April increase and we wouldn’t feel comfortable ignor ing it. If we were redoing our projections now, we’d tack a tenth or two onto our inflation projections f or 1999 and 2000. This would not really alter the basic conclusion that we, and now m any bond m arket comm entato rs, have reached : that the best news on inflation is behind us and th at prices will m ost likely tend to accelerate o ver tim e unless dom estic dem and softens cons iderably or we experience a ddition al fortuitous exte rnal shocks. Given that we cannot divine those s hocks, we’ve pointed to the likely need for som e monetary policy tighten ing aim ed at reining in aggregate demand. The fixed-incom e markets ha ve been firm ing on their own in recen t week s--esp ecially  in the case of Treasury securities. But it isn’t clear that this is wholly a real tig htening, as opposed to an escalation of inflation prem iums. Moreover, m any lower quality corporate bond issuers have seen rates fall and their m arket access im prove of late, and the s tock good fashion. Barring further adverse ne ws, we can easily see stock and bond prices turning back up in the co ming weeks. Thus, we don’t believe that the m arkets alone can be relied upon to do the work of curbing the financial support for unsustainabl e levels of aggregate dem and. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Mike, in line with the notion you raised ab out the inability of m aintaining the s eason ally adjus ted level of housing starts as we m ove into the period where th e seas onals start to  rise, I do re call that the una djusted April starts figures were down. Were the perm its down unadjusted? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I don’t have any additional detail beyond the knowledge that total starts were down som ething under 3 percent in A pril. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Unadjusted starts? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Yes. But, given that the level of starts look s low relative to perm its at this point, I suspect  that in reality we probably did not have an unadjusted data to refine that imm ediately. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You don’t re call whether the perm its, unadjusted, were down? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I don’t have that inform ation. 5/18/99 15 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. We d o have that? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Yes, we do. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, it is no t crucial. Does anyone rem ember whether or not the seasonal for May goes up over the April seasonal? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I think the seasonals do conti nue to move in that direction to som e degree. I have those numbers with m e, so let me check. Well, actually, the season al factor in May is about the sam e as in April a nd then June is the low point f or the seasonal factor. It is just a little lower. We have had the m ajor swing in the s easonal factors in the last two m onths. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Really from  February to April is the big surge? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. It’s basically February to April. The surge starts in February, but from  January to April is the story. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Other questi ons for Mike?  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Mike, I want to ask you about your statements regarding productivity. That, of course, is  something in which we are all very interest ed. I thought I heard you say in your comments that becau se of structural im prove ments and efficiencies you have added several tenths onto your productivity forecast for 1999 and 2000. Part 1 of the Greenbook on page 13 has a re ference to an increase of ½ percentage point in you r forecas t of labor produ ctivity gain s. One questio n is: Are we talk ing abo ut the sam e number here?  My second question relates to your comment that you didn’t think there was any reason to expect this to fall off in the near term . The question is: What is your sense as to what is goi ng to happen beyond 2000 on these structural improve ments? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. On the first question, part  of the increase in the productivity growth that we have in o ur forecast reflect s the stronger dem and trends an d the cyclical component. I would say that a little more  than half, roughly, of the increase in productivity  growth goin g forward is attribut able to the m ore positiv e view we have of the structural im prove ments in productivit y. The second question is obviously very important if one is in the business of m aking 10-year budget forecasts or 75-year social security f orecasts. It is n ot a to tally u ninte resting question for us, either, even with our shorter tim e frame, in part because one would want to have a sense of what expectations 5/18/99 16 might be and what would be built into peopl es’ p ermanent incom e views. If people felt that we were just experiencing a brief period of prosperity with these huge productivity gains, they m ight behave differently than if th ey viewed this as a new era , as it were, that will last de cades. I think in a sense the sto ck market is proba bly behavin g as if  it is a new era. That is the way one can  best understand the longer-term profit forecasts and so on. So, while we prefer to be noncomm ittal, it a ppears that what is going on in the economy forecast, if not a better o ne. I can easily se e this productivity  performance not persisting. I can also see this as being a transition phase into a sustained period of more rapid growth. After all, we have had perio ds of  more than decades in duration in which productivity growth has averaged 3 percent. The num bers we are working with are in line with the very long-term  trends in the United S tates. So we are not looking at a radically high productivity advance here  in a broader historical context. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . I agree that it is n ot rad ically high in an hist orical context; but compared with three or four years ago when we were talk ing about a 0.9 percent increase in productivity on average, it is a very significant difference. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Some of this reflects cha nges in m easurem ent--the introduction of new weighting that has altered the history by a fe w tenths. But, as we look at it, we also had a period in the late 1980s and early 1990s when in particular capital w as shallowing, and the low levels of investm ent did not help to boost productivity in that period. In the mid-1990s and since then, we have seen that change considerably. So there are factors that a re readily id entifiable. It isn’t possibl e to pin down what contribution investm ent is making, but the norm al kinds of calculations one  can do suggest that investm ent has been a significant elem ent in boosting productivity im provem ent in recent years. On top of that we do s eem to be getting som e extra produ ctivity incr ease, so-ca lled multif actor productivity gains. All that  fits with one’s sense of what has been going on in the business sector--that firm s have been ta king advantage of new technologies, have reorganized the way they do things, and so on. It has not been just the brute force addition of capital goods that has promoted this improvem ent. We are extrapolating this out for a lim ited tim e here, given our projection period. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 5/18/99 17 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mike, I have two questions, and the first one is on productivity as well. Estimates of the productivity trend seem  to have been revised quite frequently in the last few years. To me, this suggests  greater uncertainty about the productivity forecast. W ouldn’t you h ave to conclude that  the uncertainties associated with our forecast of real outpu t and inflation must be  greater g iven the uncertainties that are associa ted w ith th e produ ctivity forecast? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. If the locus of the uncertainty is productivity, I’m not sure that we are m ore uncertain about it now than we were  three years ago or six years ago. I think there has always been a considerable ba nd of uncertainty around the prospects for productivity. We were puzzled by w hy productiv ity gains were so low for m any years. I guess I don’t feel any more uncom fortable on that score. The only way I feel uncomfortable is that, in a se nse, we are m oving a bit beyond the pack. But I think others are m oving up their assessm ents of productivity  trends, too, as they overcom e the basic scien tific skeptic ism reflected in the of ten heard statem ent that th is recent experience isn’t y et a statis tically signif icant de viation from the previous trends. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. The second question relates to the fact that the Y2K effect in the Greenbook forecast appears quite large. Com pared with the consensus o f Blue Chip forecasters, for exam ple, it is consid erably larger.  Do you wa nt to comm ent a little on what your thought process was? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. This is an area where m any fo recasters h ave been reluctan t to take a position, and thus it probabl y hasn’t shown up in their forecasts. I know that the National Association of Business Econom ists ju st com pleted a poll of their m embers, and they ind icated that they expected ab out a ¼ percent addition to third-quarter GDP growth and a ½ percent addition in the fourth quarter. But there is still som e reluctance, given the lack of hard inform ation, to go ou t on a lim b and write do wn a num ber that will stick out in any w ay. Now, I m ight note that th e latest forecast by Goldm an Sachs, which I just received  yesterd ay, looked som ewhat like our forecast. They have a considerab le increase in inventory investm ent in the four th quarter, driving GDP growth up to about 4 percent and then a drop-back in inventory investm ent in the first quarter, though not to a very low level, which gets their first-qua rter GDP down to around zero. I know from having talked with their econom ists that their security analysts are hearing reports from 5/18/99 18 various com panies that f irms are planning to do som e precautionary stock building. It is not across the board, but they are hearing this and  I think g radually e conomists are probably building som ething into their foreca sts. But this is an area of enorm ous uncertainty. It is very difficult to quantify. What we have in our for ecast is a very small increase in the num ber of days’ supply; in fact, it isn’t even a day’s supply. So there is a lot of room  to m aneuver here if people begin to  get worried. In som e sense this is just flagging the fact that som ething m ay happe n. There probably is going to be som e turbulence in the data. I am afraid we are going to have a hard tim e sorting out the underlying trends late this y ear and early next year. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I have a question about the outlook for investm ent, which is driven im portan tly, as it should be, b y acceler ation considerations. My sense is th at investm ent has been very strong both because of the labo r market tigh tness and the n eed to substitute capital for la bor and because of the attrac tiveness of new technologies designed to improve productivity. When you look at capacity utilization, do you have a sense of how m uch of t he re ported capacity is really genui ne capacity, given the newer technologies that are com ing in?  I rem ember what happened in the early 1980s, for exam ple, when the steel industr y was being hit hard. There wa s a lot of steel capacity on the books that, in fact, w as never put back to work even though the economy revived. I would guess that we m ight have som ething similar going on now with the rapid growth of these new technologies that  are simply m aking som e of the old capacity on the books no longer relevant for capacity utilization co nsiderations. Do you have a sense of that? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I would say that we ha ve som e reasonable anchors for our assessm ent of capacity utilizati on. The series is periodically  benchm arked to Census data in which companies report what they perceive  to be their level of  capacity utilization based on a given definition. That definition ha s been uniform  over tim e, so we think we have a consistent tim e series. The N ationa l Association of Purc hasing Managers sem i-annually asks its m embers to report on what th ey believe their capacity utilization to be. It usually isn’t exactly our num ber. But the two series track togeth er over tim e, and the 5/18/99 19 readings through the end of last year sti ll looked reasonably ali gned. We should get another reading in a few weeks in the m idyear survey of the purchasing m anagers. Finally, if one looks at vendor perform ance, whic h historically has been pretty well correlated with capacity utilization, we don’ t see anything to sugge st that we are far off the m ark. One additional point is that there is nothing in the behavior of producer prices that is signaling that the capacity utilizatio n num bers are leading us astray. Now , one m ight wonder--g iven a world in which m any goods are availab le overseas and h ave relatively low transpor tation cos ts and where pla nts m ay have the f lexibility to adjus t their production on a tighter sc hedule and so on--whether th e supply curve has precisely the sam e slope in the sho rt run that it used to  have. That is an interesting analytical question, which we need to continue to explor e. But in term s of the reading on capacity use at this point, I don’t think we are any furt her off now than we have been in the past in judging that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. I remem ber that s teel issue. My recollection is that a lot of plant m anagers knew at the time that they had open hearth furnaces and rolling facilities which were clearly of an ear lier age. It would be interesting to know whether in the Census Bureau data, as distin ct fro m the Am erican Iron and  Steel Institu te data, the plant m anagers were reporting that as true capacity under the Census definition, which has a cost elem ent in it as I recall. That is, the question is not sheer physical facilities but what can be brought into producti on at a reasonable m arginal cost. I would doubt very much that those stee l facilities would have m et that definition back then. I guess we would have to argue at this partic ular stage that individual m anagers who are reporting to the Bureau o f the Census are awar e of whether what they have is obsolescent or not. They can be wrong, but it is their judgment, and I don’t know how we could do bette r than that. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. There is a strong tendency  on these form s for people to put in about the sam e number they di d last year, as we all know. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Sure. But I th ink the point that Mike is m aking is that we don’t project capacity i ndependently. What is projected  is the operating rate. We get capacity by division, a nd that is essentially--

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. That is true of the estim ation of ca pacity utilization up to a point. 5/18/99 20 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Then you sm ooth it out. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Then we look at investm ents and so on to judge what capacity growth would be going forward. I think the quest ion they are asked to answer is what is their capac ity utiliza tion rate  given a norm al operation of th eir plants, not allowing for additions of extra shifts and t hose sorts of things. It is a question that is consistent over time. So whatever it is m easuring, it is m easuring it on a reasonably stable basis. Given all the other pieces of inf ormation, I don’t see an ything th at seem s particu larly odd. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. The point is that it may be consistent over time, but you don’t want it to be consistent o ver tim e if the underly ing pace of technology has suddenly changed dram atically. A whol e lot of new technology is com ing in. That’s not unlike the change in the exchange rate in the earl y 1980s, w hich perm anently put under water a whole lot of U.S. m anufacturing capacity. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. They are not reporting that th ey have the sam e capacity as before nor that they are using the sam e amounts as  before, but the question they are responding to is consistent. So, conceptually w hat they are trying to m easure is consistent over tim e. As I said, I just don’t see anyt hing that looks particularly odd in the variables that we would expect to respond to capacity utilization. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We have two m easures--the ones I assum e you are talking abou t--which are the le ad tim es on th e deliveries of materials and the num ber of items in short supply. The lead tim es are stre tching out som e, especia lly in steel with the prospect of a steel strike. The num ber of item s in short supply, which are reported on a reasonably consistent basis by the purchasing m anagers, has been zero for a long period of time. So the sym ptom s of capacity res traint are not there and what we see is no t inconsistent with the 80 percen t or so capacity utilization rate  that we show for industrial production in m anufacturing. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. The other point to raise is one that the Chairm an reiterated in a speech recently. And th at is, if you see inci pient labor cost p ressures, ho w readily can you adjust the productive capacity of your plant?  How quickly can you purchase and install capital goods?  That is another elem ent that one would have to think about in term s of the dynam ics going forward. 5/18/99 21 I might just respond to the Chairm an’s ear lier question on perm its. My colleague handed m e the press release, which I didn’t have  with m e earlier. The perm its for single-family hom es in April w ere the sam e as they wer e in Mar ch; the drop was  in m ultifamily perm its.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Yes, unadjusted. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I hav e a couple of questions about som e issues that have been talked about already. First, on the Y2K effect, you have GDP growth m oving from somewhere in the high 2 percent to th e middle 3 percent area through 1999 down effectively to zero in the first quarter of 2000. That seem s to be driven both by the change in business inventories and the cha nge in consum er expenditures on nondurables, which in som e sense is a double whammy. I am sure it is extrem ely well thought out [laughter] but it just seem s--

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Need I say m ore?  [Laughter] I wish I could! We are flying blind again. Maybe we are ov erly influenced  by our experience with snowstorm s in Washington D.C. when e verybody runs out and buys m ilk and toilet paper and cleans off the shelves of the grocery stores. I think we  should expect, even if we don’t get all kinds of dra matic Y2K program s on television and sc ary stories on talk radio, that people are going to be concerned. Polls s uggest that if people are prom pted to think about the Y 2K issue, th ey say: “Yes, we will take s ome precautions.” So th e notion is that people will buy som e extra food and those who are dependent  on prescription drugs will try to refill their prescriptions early so they don’t have to worry about computer  glitches creating a problem  in early 2000. There are various th ings I think p eople will want to buy, figuring that they will just use them up in January  if they don’t need them  over the year-end period. We also hear sto ries abou t people plann ing to buy guns and amm unition, dehydrated food, electrical ge nerators, and wood burning stoves. These things are happening. The questio n is whether they ar e eco nomically m eaningful. But som e little move ment at the end of the year seem s inevitable. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do you recomm end that we move our February FOMC m eeting back to Decem ber?  [Laughter] 5/18/99 22 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. From  what I understand about the thorough preparations that people are m aking at the Federal Reserve Board, I suspect we would be able to m eet here even on January 2nd if we wanted to. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I was  just wondering wh ether people will be building up an invento ry at hom e of som e of the sam e things that busin esses will be bu ilding and ho w much double counting there m ight be. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. We have allowed for that on a very lim ited scale in both cases. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. The other thing I wanted  to ask you about is the distinction you draw between the productivity that is dr iven by additional dem and and that which reflects some underlying trend increases. I am wondering how it is that we can be at all sure about that. I know from  our own busine ss advisory councils that in m any different industries people are beginning to  say they are in a sense ha nging on by their fingernails. They don’t want to add people; they don’t want to add to cost s; they are driving their own production facilities as f ast and as hard as they can. In our own Bank the volum es in our check-clearing operation s recen tly are doubl e our norm al volum es for a variety of reasons. And I have heard stories from e mployees at breakfast about staff running pell-mell to the elevato rs with cartloads f ull of ch ecks to try to m ake the courier tim es because processing has been so much heavier than us ual. I don’t think th is has anything to do with the econom y; it has to do with banking reorganization in our District. Our own productivity undoubtedly looks re ally great right now, but we  would not be able to continue to move this volum e of checks out the door for very  long. Reconcilem ent issues and other kinds of issues would come back to bite us if we did that for very long. I am just wondering how you tell the difference. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. It is obviously very difficu lt and it is a judgm ent call. But I think the kind of situation you are describing, though co mplicated, is one reason to anticipate that a t least som e com panies will hir e additional workers. You say com panies are working beyond sustainable levels of  labor  utilization, but you also say they are absolutely determ ined not to add workers. In other cases, I think people are working very hard, and firm s would like to add workers bu t are finding it difficult to do so in a very tight labor m arket. For the la tter group, we would anticipate th at, even if business begins 5/18/99 23 to flatten out, som e of these firm s will follow through on their hiring plans to reach a more comfortable position. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. And they would be entry workers. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. And that would be a s ource of a cyclical weak ening in productivity. On the other hand, there is stil l obviously a very strong culture of cost control--that m ay be your firs t group--and m anagers will do ab solutely anything they can do to keep their labor fo rce to an abs olute  minimum . And where they use tem ps and other contingent workers, those people wi ll probably find thei r hours or employm ent reduced fairly rapidly. So I think th ere is a b alance in th is prospect. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. I think there is a distinction here on which we cannot put a num ber, but we can get a judgm ent. The point I was m aking at Mike Moskow’s conference earlier this m onth, and I may have m entioned it at our last FOMC meeting as well, strikes m e increasingly as the really c rucial elem ent in m aking that differentiation. A number of years ago--m aybe 5, 8, or 10 years ago--those of us who were working as business consultants of som e kind or another spent a very considerable amount of ti me addressing the fact that al l key business decisions were m ade with a probability distribution around them . And in order to pro tect either the level of production that the firm  needed or the value of the franchise, a com pany had to introduce layers of saf ety stock inventory on the one hand and redundancies of people on the other. And as inform ation technology gradually reduced  the variance of error in the decision-making processes--in a sense knowledge becam e more and more cru cial--the need to have all of these redundancies gradually dissi pated. When they are stripped out of the system , they are perm anent structural pr oductivity changes; output per hour is perm anently changed. The type of productivity you are discussing is not in a sense real productivity. Well, I guess you could call that productivity, but it certainly is not trend productivity. It is, I would say, a cyclical dynam ic. And that is the reason why we try to cyclically ad just th e prod uctiv ity da ta; we try to get a rate of change with that cyc lical factor rem oved. And the tru th of the m atter is that I don’t s ee how we will know which is which until after the fact. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Right. 5/18/99 24 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Further que stions for Mike?  If not, would somebody like to start the go- around?  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, the Fifth District economy rem ains robust overall. I think I have probably started m y comm ents at the last eight or nine FOMC meetings with that sam e statem ent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I don’t know why I even ask f or your report! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Nevertheless,  that is definitely the case. But, if anything, there s eems to be som e evidence of a possible acceleration in activ ity ove r the la st sev eral weeks. Manufacturing is stil l a very important part of th e econom ic base in our region; you nam e it; we m ake it in the Fifth District . And manufacturing ac tivity clearly seems to have bottom ed out and turned up. Consum er spending is very strong. We had expected it to be strong, but its recen t strength has exceeded  even those ex pectations. Probably the strongest sector  in the D istrict’s econom y now i s construction, both residential and commercial. We are sitting in one of the hottest m arkets in the region right h ere in the D.C. are a; that’s true  in the Dis trict of Columbia as well a s in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs. There is plen ty of m oney around to finance all of this building, m aybe too m uch. The only apparent co nstraints that we are seeing and hearing about in con struction are the shortages of skilled workers and  certain m aterials. Elsewhere, both comm ercial and consum er credit are readily  available. So far we do not have any significant evidence of a d ecline in credit quality. But we are hearing from  experienced bankers, anecdo tally at leas t, that the com petition f or loa ns is very, very strong--probably excessi ve--which m ay be laying the foundation for problem s down the road. On the price and wage side, retail pri ce increases in the region have been accelerating lately, slowly but steadily accord ing to the s ervice secto r surv ey we do monthly. At our last board m eeting the Chairm an of Reynolds Metals, who has been complaining about weak m etals and other comm odity prices f or at leas t a year and a half, told us th at prices of  a broad rang e of item s--not only m etals but othe r commodities h e deals with in his business--have turned up. Finally, while there is not yet a lot of hard evidence regarding rising wages in the District, w e are hearin g more and more anecd otal 5/18/99 25 comments regarding pay increases and a speedin g up of wage increases here and there in different industries. At the natio nal lev el, it s eems to m e that when one puts last w eek’s CPI and industrial production reports in a longer-term  context, they i ndicate that the risk in the outlook has now m oved pretty sharply to the ups ide. Back in Nove mber when we put in place the las t of our three polic y easings, we did so because we were concerned that the financial turmoil and the credit crunch that  might com e with it could push the econom y into a recession. There is no question that t hose easing m oves did calm  financial m arkets at the tim e. But they als o delive red, in m y view, a very strong m onetary impulse to an econom y which, even then, was arguably at risk  of overheating. I think we have seen and are seeing th e results. Private dom estic final purchases rose at a 7½ percen t rate in the first quarter. I agree with you, Mike, that that is probably ab ove trend, but it’s probably not too m uch above trend; I think final purch ases grew 6½ percent last year. And given the num ber for the f irst quarte r of this year, the staff has increased its projection of real GDP growth over the next two years by ½ percentage point and now sees the unem ployment rate as low as 4 pe rcent by the end of the year. That is the context in which we have to view th is April CPI report. Obviously, I don’t want to put too m uch we ight on one figure, especially one that m ay have som e seasonal adjustm ent problem s, as I gather th is one m ay have. But against the background I just rev iewed it is worrisom e to m e because it offers the firs t direct evid ence in som e time that inflation pressures m ay be building. The breadth of the increases in the core index I found especially troubling. But even the headline figure--ref lecting the jum p in oil prices--had a big im pact. The oil price increas e is going to get som e attention if  it stimulates increased inflati on expectations going forward. And sooner or later, if it continues, it is going to show up in the core price com ponent of the index. Finally, the 20 basis point jum p in the long bond rate to alm ost 6 percent, which came on top of an increase after m id-April of  about 15 basis points, m akes it clear that the m arkets have taken this report reasonably seriously and have not just dism issed it as monthly noise. So for me, the bottom line is tha t at this po int everyone is watching us. People in the m arkets especia lly are watching to see how we  are going to respond to what 5/18/99 26 Just one add itional thoug ht if I m ay, Mr. Chairm an: The m onetary s timulus we injected in 1998 I think is a bit rem iniscent of the stim ulus we injected in 1987 in the immediate wake of the stock m arket crash. With that in m ind, I think it is worth remembering that the latter was sufficient to  help  set off an increas e in ov erall CPI inflation--briefly to 6.3 percent in 1990. Oil prices were a fa ctor then, but the core rate also went up  in tha t period. It is tru e, of course, th at we have more credib ility now th an we did then, but dem and is stronger now than it was then. Labor m arkets are a lot tighter. I know I have been crying wolf around this ta ble for a long tim e and my fears have not been realized, but we have to take each day as it com es, I guess. So, wolf! [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You’ve m ade it impossible for anyone else to come after you! [Laughter] Who wa nts to try?  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . I was hoping it was not going to be m e! [Laughter] The Seventh District econom y continues to expand at a m oderate pace. However, we are starting to see som e subtle changes. Consum er spending rem ains healthy and housing activity is at high levels, but we are now seeing a few signs of  moderation in these areas. Conditions in the ag sector generally rem ain depressed, but results from  our recent survey of agricultural bankers suggest  that there has been no furt her deterioration in farm land values. Despite the continuing problem s in steel and farm  equipm ent, our m anufacturing sector is perfor ming well and m ay be pick ing up steam . As e vidence, the Purchasing Managers’ S urveys from  Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee indicate that expansion of overall m anufacturing activity has picked up in the past three m onths. Motor vehicle producers continue to experien ce strong sales. April sale s of light vehicles again surprised us on the upside, and heavy-duty truck backlogs are still quite high. In fact, the autom obile industry is doing so well that prof its are high, leading one senior official at a major automaker to m ention to m e that he expected very difficult la bor negotiations later this year. Tensions are high and there is a strong potential f or labor disruptions. One major issue in the negotiations, of cour se, will be the use of outsourcing. More generally, our labor markets rem ain tight, and the puzzle of slowing compensation growth is even m ore pronounced  in the Midwest than in the national numbers. Our business contacts  are starting to report less cu stom er resistance to price 5/18/99 27 increases than was apparent a year or two ago. This is no t a sea change, as Mike Prell discussed, but we are hearing m ore anecdotes , and I thought I would m ention a few. One of our form er director s with a large trucking opera tion noted that his f irm was negotiating contracts with higher prices fo r the f irst tim e in m any years. A major printing firm reported that a dvertising rates are increasing. A national specialty retailer mentioned to m e that wholesale prices for fu rniture were up sharply;  he added that costs for building new stores, includi ng land, had risen 50 percent ov er the las t three years. Last tim e I noted that the prices paid co mponent from  the Chicago Purchasing Managers’ Survey m oved above 50 percent in March fo r the first tim e since April 1998. That component moved even higher this April, from  52.5 to 56.7 percent. And purchasing managers from  Detroit and Milwaukee also reported that prices paid m oved above 50 percent in both of those months. The Milw aukee report pro vides ev idence that energ y was not the only culprit, as 11 of the 21 co mmodity prices survey ed were above 50 in This regional pricing news leaves me qu ite sensitive to the d ata con tained in Friday’s CP I report. As Al Broaddus m entioned, of course, we should not m ake too much of a single m onth’s data, though the increas es appear to be broadly based. In fact, my biggest concern rem ains not inflation this  year, but rather th e acceleration in core inflation exp ected nex t year, perhaps from  a higher level than we forecasted before. In addition, incom ing data have re mained strong since our last meeting when we raised our forecast of real GDP growth for both this year  and next; if productiv ity growth rem ains as rapid as it has been for the past few quarters,  then this projected real growth would be sustainable. But if, as my som ewhat pessim istic staff keeps telling m e, trend productivity growth has not picked u p as m uch a s the Greenb ook asserts, we could face a substan tial incre ase in inf lation by the end of  next year. Thus, I think the  risks hav e becom e tilted

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, econom ic growth in the Twelfth District has shown som e signs of m oderation, but it is still rapid. In Nevada and Arizona, the pace of job growth has slowed som ewhat from last yea r’s very fast pace, but th ese states still r ank first and third in term s of em ploym ent growth over the past tw elve m onths. In the Pacific 5/18/99 28 Northwest, employm ent growth pick ed up in Oregon but cutb acks in aero space manufacturing jobs held down such growth in the state of Wash ington. California’s relatively rapid pace of job grow th also m oderated a bit in recent m onths as a contraction of the state’s m anufacturing payr olls partly offset em ploym ent gains in other sectors. Overall, California em ploym ent has grown at roughly a 2 per cent r ate so f ar this ye ar, which is down about 1 percentage point from  last year’s pace. Even so, California’s unem ployment rate of 5.6 percen t is down significantly since the end of last year. Turning to the national scene, obviously th e data have revealed a stronger- than-expected econom y once again, cau sing us to revise our real GDP forecast upward. The contour of the forecast h as not chang ed very m uch, however. We still exp ect th e econom y to slow, only now the phrase “slowing econom y” means a growth rate of about 3¼ percent for the rem aining quarters of the y ear. The GDP price index is projected to grow at a rate of about 1 to 1½ percent over the sam e period. However, recent forecast errors suggest that there is considerable uncer tainty associated with this outlook. We are all well aware that real output has consiste ntly grown faster than predicted in recent years. And if we had som ehow known how  fast the econom y would grow over this period, we would have overpredict ed inflation even m ore than we actually did. It seem s clear that we are experiencing a positive supply shock but one whose m agnitude and duration are hard to determ ine. The e xiste nce of a supply shock m akes it hard to judge inflationary risk by looking at  real output growth, since su ch shocks tend to change the output/inflation m ix in the econom y. A reasonable response to this uncertainty is to follow a strategy that is fairly robust in the face of such shocks. One such strategy would be to pay m ore atten tion to the growth in nom inal GDP or spending. As supply shocks change output and inflation growth in op posite d irections, they w ill obv iously  have a sm aller im pact on nom inal GDP. Keeping an eye on spending would allow us to keep inflation within reasonable bounds, even if we are unsure about the econom y’s potential growth rate. Using nominal GDP in this way--tha t is, as an ind icator--is similar to the wa y that we ac tually em ployed the m onetary aggregates before velocity sh ifts made them  hard to in terpret. The data show that nom inal GDP growth has averaged close to 5½ percent ove r the previous three years. This suggests to m e that, despite the uncertainties associated with the supply 5/18/99 29 shock, the policy choices m ade during this peri od have been appropriate. By allowing growth to com e in higher and prices lower than anticipated, we have in effect been stabilizing n ominal GDP to som e degree. In this light, howev er, the recen t acceleratio n in nom inal GDP in the past two quarters causes m e som e concern. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. Discussions w ith directors and advisory council members since our March 30 m eeting have gone in the direction of reconfirm ing that the regional eco nomy is very strong. Even th e com munities that are m ost in fluenced by steel, which had been registering som e concern earlier, have reported that business conditions never got as bad as they had feared  and that they have started to show some improve ment. Wheeling Steel, for instance, is al ready recalling workers. Structu ral steel orders are s till strong an d it was sug gested th at some “strik e hedge” sto ckpiling m ay be going on at the present tim e, with the backlog building. Because of worldwide o vercapacity, st eel industry people exp ect to see significant consolidation in th e steel industry. In particular, they expect W estern European companies to be acquiring U.S. pr oducers. In the first quarter, an overall would be com ing in. And there was a declin e in Japanese steel and Russian steel. However, that was m ore than offset by an increas e in Korean and Brazilia n steel. So, steel imports in the f irst quarte r were up 4½ percent versus a year earlier. In motor vehicles, production is reported to be flat out at the plants around the District, with som e of the larg er plants, at General Motors in  particular, operating 7 days a week. And the workers are getting tired of it. One of the truck body manufacturers responded to a shortage of welders by starting to offer courses in the high school, where he pays his em ployees to go and teach welding shop. We have an interesting situ ation with Honda. They have a number of plants in Ohio and they have in the past been consid ered a m odel of l abor/m anagem ent relations in the non-unionized sector. The UAW attem pted to organize them  twice, in 1985 and 1989. Early this year, a petition from work ers asked the UAW to try again. The UAW Team sters. The Team sters went to the UAW  and the UAW  said th e attempt would not 5/18/99 30 work and they were not interest ed in trying again, so the Team sters decided to try. Out of 8,000 workers at the various plants, they ha ve already collected 3,800 cards--they have not certified them  all and they need to ha ve about 2,400 certified--which got the UAW’s attention very quickly. The UAW  has petitioned for a hearing, which is being held today, to decide whether or not the Team sters do in fact have jurisdiction or whether they will have to turn the organizing effort over to th e UAW. A contact in the Team sters local in Colum bus said that they had not expected th e organizing drive to be successful the first time around. They were caught com pletely off guard by the response of the workers. So, that is one w e plan to m onitor closely. Union communications workers just settled with a company in Cincinnati; the contract is for three y ears and the package is 6  percen t per year for the three-year period. In construction, the situation has been desc ribed as a surge of  new business, even though there continue to be shortag es of work ers with various  crafts and s kills. Some said those shortages are worse than before. The Ohio building trades now  expect to have at least two more years of hi gh levels of construction activity . On the residentia l side, builde rs say the prob lem with sta rts activity is that they are so far behind schedule on existing projects that they are seeing more delays, longer tim es to com plete projects w hen they do start new ones, and thus they are relu ctant to extend the pipeline any further. People f rom Pittsbu rgh s ay that the c ity is in the early s tages of a major construc tion boom  that will las t five y ears; and that includes th e build ing of stadium s, convention centers, theaters, bank operation centers, downtown retail space, tunnels, and bridges. Earlier, people from  western Pennsylvani a had been saying that they were lagging considerably behind Ohio and Kentucky but now  they claim  that they h ave closed the gap. They have experienced very rapid growth  and have labor shorta ges in  an increasin g number of  comm unities.  A contact f rom one of  the community banks in s outhwest Pennsylvania said that a signi ficant employer for their comm unity decided to go out of business and laid off 200 workers. So the bank joined with som e others to co-sponsor a job fair for the displaced  employees. But th ey had to cancel the job fair b ecause the workers had  all found jo bs before th e fair took p lace. A food processing com pany in Ohio reported continued strong sales at both what they ca ll the in-sto re retail and their 8 00 Intern et services or catalog sales. They are very 5/18/99 31 happy about that. But th ey are no t happy on th e cost sid e: Freezer sto rage rates in the first quarter were up 13 to 18 percent from a year earlier; health care costs in 1999 are now budgeted to be up 14 percent from  a year earlier; and prices of corrugated packing material in the first three m onths of the year  were 15 percent above year-earlier levels. Other m anufacturing reports included tool a nd die com panies who say they have now fully recovered from  the earlier loss of business to Asian im ports. A manufacturer of safety equipm ent for m ining and m anufacturi ng com panies reports that in addition to continued strong U.S. orders, they h ave recen tly seen som e pickup in orders from  both Asia and Europe. Bankers in the region report strong loan  dem and in every category. We asked our Comm unity Bank Advisory Council why we no longer hear the stories we were hearing a couple of years ago about people walking in and tu rning over the keys to their vehicle because they could not afford to pay for the car, the truck, or whatever it was. And the bankers did not really have a coherent  response. They said these stories have stopped totally. Some guess that it has to do with wealth effects from  the stock m arket, the equity taken out from refinancing hom es, and debt consolidations. They m ention various reasons why they conjec ture that those “stretched” consum ers no longer exist. But no one had any stories to tell. In agriculture, conditions in our area sound a little better than  in Mike Moskow’s District. Bankers and one agri cultural supplier have told us that it has been a very good planting season; all the planting has been done. They experienced fall ing seed, fertilizer, and energy prices during the planting season and--assum ing th ey get appropriate am ounts of rain--they are optim istic at this point about having a good year , the first in three years. We still h ear reference s to, in one per son’s words,  “outrag eous prices ” bein g paid f or farmland. The reports are that it is not th e neighbor farm er buying the land but som ebody coming from som ewhere else, and often these ar e cash deals. Another banker said that he tracks what he calls the debt serv ice per acre of farm land and it is the highest level he has ever seen. Let m e turn to the na tional scen e for a m oment. I always have trouble using the word “inflation,” m ainly because of the way people also use words like “deflation.” So inste ad I th ink in te rms of the purchasing power of our currency and I try to give som e 5/18/99 32 meaning to the express ion “price stab ility.” What we m ean by price s tability is th at people m ake decisions in the expectation th at the purchasing power  of a dollar in the future is going to be the sam e as it is today. When that condition is m et, we get efficient allocation of  resources at the business le vel and the household level, and we get maximum growth in our standards of livi ng. We have had the experience of people revising downward their expectations for the future about what we call inflation, though perhaps not by as m uch as the declin e in the reported num bers for late last year and the early m onths of this year. And that was, in words that we used som e time ago, a pe riod where we could have exerci sed “opportunistic disinflati on policy” and locked that progress in. We clearly m issed that opportunity  and did not lock it i n. It’s m uch more likely that people expect the purchasing power of  the dollar to declin e faster in th e future than has been the cas e in their recent experien ce. I think we h ave to an ticipate th at fro m this point forward people are going to exp ect higher rather than lower inflation.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The e conom y in the Kansas City District remains quite strong: Employm ent e dged up again in March; retail sales remain generally strong; and constructi on indicators are quite strong. The price of  construction m aterials has in creased significan tly so far th is year, both in the region and more broadly. As a side note, I will tell you that about 10,000 homes and businesses were destroyed or severely dam aged by the recent tornadoes in Oklahom a and Kansas. While the short-term effect is obviously devastating, that does imply som e additional b uilding boo m com ing our way. That will b e a factor in our District. More specificall y, though, one of our directors who is in the construction industry has seen sizable price increases on m aterials in that  industry since the beginning of the year. Prices of roc k, gravel, and aggregates are up 10 percent, lum ber 6 percent, concrete 4½ percent, an d sheet rock, of course, is up about 50 percent. While m anufacturing a ctivity h as bee n a little slu ggish in the District up u ntil recen tly, it is picking up . Some of our m anufacturers are seeing an increase in dem and from Asia, and that inclu des China, d espite som e of the other developm ents in that region. Also, at least from  our directors’ point of view, some of the recovery in alum inum  prices ref lects incre ased d emand in Asia. Energy a ctivity with in the Distric t 5/18/99 33 has steadied in the sense of not declining any longer; firm s in that industry are waiting to see to what extent these energy pr ice incre ases w ill stick bef ore m aking their own plan s for future activity. Wage pressures appear to be increasing in  the District, at leas t som ewhat. Our unem ployment rate is about 3.4 percent and we have a very high participation rate, so we have very strong pressure on our labor m arkets. In fact, in the construction industry, which is obviously under the m ost pressure, and in the crafts industrie s such as carpentry and plum bing, contracts for wage increases of  5½ percent per year  for the next three years hav e recently been  signed in o ur area. Retail prices have edged up, as som eone else m entioned. And I would echo the point, based on talking with business people in our region, that there is a hint of a different attitude toward pri ce increas es. There is a sense of challenging the status quo and seeing if  perhaps pr ice inc reases will stick this tim e, with more of  an expecta tion that they will. Whether that will o ccur w ill only b e known in tim e, I realize. The farm  econom y rem ains fundam entally weak. Supplies are large and export dem and has not picked up that we can s ee. Despite this, farm  finances rem ain strong, and there is a lot of anticipation about what will com e out of Congress this year on that issue. Our land values have rem ained resilien t despite thes e kinds of pressures, although our last survey indicated about a 1 percent decline in land prices in the aggregate. Turning to the national econom y, I s ee another year of strong econom ic activity. While growth in GDP m ay moderate, I think it is going to m oderate to a rate well above its longer-term trend and rem ain significantly stronger th an the FOMC central tendency forecasts from  our February Hum phrey -Hawkins meeting. I must say th at I am struck by the strength of th e dom estic econom y. Over the last four quarters private domestic sp ending has g rown about 6¼ percen t and we are forecas ting that it will g row about 5 percent this year. If one put trend productivity at a very optim istic 4 percent-­higher than I think one m ight expect--and added on 1 percent for labor force growth, that would result in potential output of , let’s say, 5 percent. And private dom estic spending at least has bee n growing f aster than th at. Offsetting  this, of  cour se, has been the weaknes s in net exports; in a sense the deterioration from  the external sector has been the relief 5/18/99 34 valve. But I think som e of the relief now is com ing from  dom estic dem and rather than the weaker external or foreign dem and. That is som ething we have to keep in m ind in terms of the pressures on global resources going forward. In sum , wha t I am  saying is that I see increasing upside risks to our forecast. Look at the Greenbook forecast, for exam ple, which shows a $450 bill ion deficit in net exports by the end of next year--though I know  the staff m ay reduce that--and still good growth in the 3½ percent range. Should our domestic dem and or foreign exports pick up, we could have even stronger growth. The poi nt is that against this background I have becom e, as I think Al Broaddus has, increasi ngly worried about th e current stance of policy and o ur ability to m aintain lo w inf lation g oing f orward.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Little h as changed in th e Eleven th District econom y since our Over the last six m onths em ploym ent growth has averaged ab out 3 perc ent, and the n ear-term outlook is for m ore of the same. Activity in both comm ercial and residential construction has been robust. In recent w eeks concerns abo ut comm ercial overbu ilding have become m ore common as the credit strain s that dev elopers faced las t Septem ber and the Dallas area, has heated up. For the firs t time in m any years used hom es have been selling the day they are listed, som etimes above the listed prices. Were it not for the continued shortage of cem ent and som e othe r building m aterials, building  activ ity wo uld be even stronger, and perhaps we woul d see less upward pressure on existing hom e prices. To some extent the shortag es will ge t wor se in th e coming months as crews a nd materials are diverted to Oklahom a to rebui ld areas destroyed by tornadoes a few weeks ago. Efforts to relieve som e of the short-term  capacity constraints are in the works. U.S. Brick com pleted a new and entirely autom ated plant adjacent to its existing facility; th e $17 m illion plant will produce 60 m illion b ricks a year, trip ling output at the site. Fifteen new jobs will be created, a testam ent to produc tivity increases. Texas Industries, a firm on whose board Governor Kelley used to serve I believe, is also expanding capacity that will m ake its facility the larges t cem ent pl ant in the United States. That $ 200 m illion 5/18/99 35 project will increas e cement capacity from  1.3 to 2.8 m illion tons per year by the fall o f the year 2000. The energy industry continues to consolidat e and contract in spite of the higher oil prices in the last few months. The Te xas rig count is at a 30-year low and our projections are that Texas dr illing activity and oil and gas employm ent may not have bottom ed out yet. The rebound in oil prices has surprised our industry contacts and they remain skeptica l that these pric es will las t. The com puter and telecommunications industries have rebounded slightly. However, we are beginning to hear com plaints  that m ore and more sectors of the business are becom ing commodities with falling prices and shrinking, razor-th in margins. A few years ago it was DRAM chips; m ore recen tly it’s  pagers. Now there is  talk of saturation in the m arket for inexpen sive com puters. The higher oil prices together with a stronger peso have boosted consum er and business confidence in Mexico. Our border ci ties have been seeing very strong retail demand from Mexican shoppers. In spite of ev er-tighter labor m arkets, we are hearing less and less discussion of upward pressu re on wages. With capital becom ing incre asingly substitutab le for labor, tight labor market s are le ss like ly to a dd to inflation ary pressur es unless th e cos t of capital ris es signif icantly. The m ain de velopm ent in the national econom y was the giant m ood swing in financial m arkets in April. Suddenly ever yone decided that the crisis countries had bottom ed out and that, given the flattening in commodity prices and the rebound in oil prices, the best days on the in flation front were behind us. Interestingly, the bad news on oil prices for the country has not been celebrated as particul arly good news in our area. As I said, our industry contacts didn’t expect  the rebound and they question its durability. The blockbuster, of course, was Friday’s CPI report. I will h ave to conc ede that it wa s only one m onth’s data; however, the risks have shifted upward.

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, conditions in the E ighth Dist rict are larg ely unchanged. The only significant developm ent is the announcem ent, which I think everybody is aware of, that Boeing will be la ying off about 7,000 workers from  a de fense 5/18/99 36 plant. But, of course, that business is goi ng to go to som e other defense plant; those aircraft, tho ugh different m odels, will be bu ilt so meplace els e. My contacts at FedEx and UPS repor ted that conditions were largely unchanged dom estically but that the volum e coming out of Asia was substantially stronger. They both m ade a point of  emphasizing to m e the pickup in Asian m arkets. And both said that Latin Am erica rem ained we ak while Europe was solid--neither strong nor weak, but just solid. My FedEx contact reported that their la bor situation is eas ing a little due to aggressive recruiting, but the com pany is still short of labor. The UPS representative said that the labo r market in Louisville is  the tightest the com pany has ever seen. One other point about FedEx I thought was interesting:  Dom estic volum e for shipm ents of aut o-related parts has expanded substantially. I gue ss Fed Ex does a lot of last m inute delivery of auto parts com ing out of Mexico and from  within the United States. And that would confirm  the other evidence we have that the auto industry is operat ing at a fairly high rate. As for the national outlook, I think that depends critically on our policy, so I am going to delay m y discussion of th e outlook un til I fold it in to the po licy discuss ion in the next go-around. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you. The District econom y rem ains robust, which is not a change in conditions. That is true virtually across th e board, whether one looks at consum er spending, tourism  activity, or m anufacturing activity. Construction is very strong, both residential and commercial, and hou ses are selling as soon as they hit the Despite the problem s in that s ector, I think it is w orth rem embering that they are no t nearly as severe as they were in the m id-1980s nor do they have the im plications for the banking system , at least at this point, that they had back then. I had a m eeting recently with a range of representatives from  the financial servic es ind ustry in the Twin Cities,  and genera lly they conf irmed this very positive v iew of regional conditions as well as broader conditions. There was a sense in their conversations about the econom y that is a bit different this time from  past experience. 5/18/99 37 One m ight expect th at from  som e of the financial people, at least thos e who are close to the equity market. I think one reason  they f eel th at way re lates to the inte rnationa l situation. They see the U.S. economy as be ing able to tap into capacity abroad, both traditional manufacturing capacity as well as la bor. They also f eel, of  course, tha t the United States is playing a particularly critic al role at the m oment in the global econom y. As far as the national outlook is concerned, I believe the prospects for real growth are f avorable. I don’t think there’s much question about that. Aggregate demand is strong and I am  relatively optim istic about ag gregate supply. I agree that we have a lot of problem s in m easuring productivity, m uch le ss forecasting  it. But I ask m yself what I think determ ines productivity. If one approach es the analysis in that way, there is reason to believe that productivity is on a m ore durab le and positive trend. And I think it is worth bearing in m ind that business people ha ve been saying f or quite some tim e--well before it s tarted to show up in the s tatistics --that they were getting sizable increas es in productivity. As far as inflation is concerned, that CPI num ber captured lots of attention, I think justifiably. It is worth rem inding our selves, though, that we have been anticipating a modest acceleration of inflation. In my judgment the p roblem  with getting too comfortable with that observation is that that m odest acceleration m ay depend crucially on m onetary policy assumptions. Thank you.

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Southeast econom y continues to operate at a very high leve l of utilization and that constr ains us from  experiencing the kind of growth rates that we saw earlier in th e expansion. Recent re tail sales gains in our area have been m odest, and single-fam ily housi ng activity has been up only slightly. At the sam e time, office and other commercial c onstruction has been a bit stronger since our last FOMC m eeting. Manufacturing has pi cked up. Our im portant tourism industry continues to do well, especia lly along the Mississippi Gu lf Coast where another huge gambling casino has just opened. That gra nd opening and the associated dem and for another 5,000 casino workers have given rise to the latest tight labor m arket story. The casino operators reportedly bought or leased  a complete apartm ent com plex to house 5/18/99 38 workers they are now bringing in from othe r less tight labor m arkets throughout rural Mississipp i. Of the specific areas of regional wea kness that I noted last tim e--na mely, energy, agriculture, and tr ade--problem s in our energy sector  have m oderated slightly to the extent that wells are no longer being ca pped; but we have not  been experiencing increases in production and drilli ng yet. There is no sign of a turnaround in the District’s trade d eficit with Latin A merica or with Asia for that m atter, and ag riculture continues to suffer from  low comm odity prices. Anecdotal infor mation on re giona l price p ressures is qu ite similar to what I have been reporting, as have ot hers. Labor m arkets are clearly  tight. Business people are complaining about finding workers. Our directors and other contacts continue to emphasize the growing role of nontradition al com pensation--b onuses, sign ing bonuses, and incentive pay--with thos e non-base salary types of com pensation being pushed further and f urther down the organizational leve l in m any fir ms. One director reported that truck drivers are being paid a $5,000 signing  bonus in order to get more trucks on the road. Benefits are also being m ade more wide ly available, e specia lly in sm all com panies, but at the sam e time som e companies are res tructuring some benefits, notably m edical, to control their costs. Two final observations from  our regional contacts: First, on e larg e reg ional retail chain has reportedly sc heduled several van loads of  spring goods from China for delivery two m onths early as a hedge agains t possible Y2K disruptions; and secondly, to build on Al Broaddus’s comment a few m inutes ago, our bank exam iners tell m e that they see som e evidence of a deterioration in cred it quality. From  their field work they have found that lenders are concerned about over ex pansion in the hotel/hospitality industry and som e relaxed credit standards and increased cr edit risks in the hea lth care sector. At the national level, like others, I have continued to enjoy observing and talking about this good ride that we are expe riencing. That’s som ething that som eone at the last m eeting rem inded us all to take the ti me to stop and do. Like others, m y staff and I continue to  think th rough the argu ments for why som e slowing of the pace of gro wth and consumer and investm ent spending shoul d begin to show through. Compared with the construct of the Greenbook, we’r e inclined to attribute a b it more of the strength in 5/18/99 39 consum er spending to current incom e, som e of which we suspect we m ay not be fully capturing an d measuring , and som ewhat less to th e wealth effect. Although I would not argue th at the funda mentals have  changed significantly since our last m eeting, I find m yself still,  and perhaps increasingly, uneasy about the inflation ou tlook. My staff, most oth er forecasters, m ost other people wh o have spok en around the table this m orning, and now it appears the bond m arkets see som e gradual deterioration  in core inflation look ing ah ead to 200 0 and 200l. The perceiv ed recen t improve ment in inflation by som e measures has to be viewed in the context of the technical adjustm ents that have m asked som e of the upward pressures. It seem s to m e that there is good reas on to be concerned about the inflation outlook regardless of which econom ic model one subscribes to. We are already seeing some reversal of the favorable trend in comm odity prices, and som e part of that very likely will b egin to feed through to p rices sometime soon. Labor m arkets are very tight and unem ployment is below even recent estim ates of the natural rate. The m oney supply, as several people have already noted, has been  overly expansive for the past two-and-a-half years, and that m ay begin to show through in inflation pressures. The seesaw pattern of productiv ity gains over recent decad es, even allowing for the sea change that m ay have taken place m ost recently,  leaves m e at least som ewhat cautious about counting on the extraordinary productivity gains we’v e experienced most recen tly to o ffset m ost or all o ther up ward cost  pressures. Of course, th e trick is to kn ow when to say when, as the commercial suggests. It seem s to me that if we com e to a shared sen se that it is tim e to begin at leas t lean ing in the d irection of  tighter po licy, w e have a window of oppor tunity to do that right now. The intern ational situati on is at least somewhat le ss fragile tha n it was th e last tim e we contem plate d a tigh tening. The U.S. econom y is still sufficiently balanced that a tig htening m ove is not likely to be terribly disruptive. If we were to m ove today or lay the groundwork for a possible m ove at our next m eeting, we could get ahead of  what I th ink we will co me to see as a problem atic period late r in the yea r, when I im agine we w ill give cons iderable we ight to prepa ring for Y2K uncertainties and possible volatility a nd will prefer policy st ability. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

MR. BOEHNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The regional econom y of the Philadelphia District remains on an upward trend. Manufacturing is strengthening. Retailers report growth in sales. Construc tion has been increasing. Business lending has picked up. Labor m arkets rem ain tight in m ost areas. Apart from  oil and tobacco p rices, inflation is b enign and pricing power rem ains larg ely nonexistent acco rding to m ost business con tacts. The o utlook for th e region al econom y is positiv e. Turning to the national econom y, the  strength in dom estic dem and continues unabated and prospects mostly are f or more of the sam e. There m ay be a m oderating trend out there, but it is elusive. Financial markets, fixed-incom e markets in particular, look increasingly norm al following their seizi ng up last sum mer and fall. Developm ents abroad, although m ixed and still worrisom e in some areas, look better or at least not as bad as feared a few m onths ago. Taken together, these developm ents--robust dom estic dem and, m ore norm al financial m arkets, and less bearishness abroad --indicate to me that the balance of risks has m ore of an upside tilt than at our last m eeting.  At the sam e time, inf lation rem ains quite benign despite recent headlines. Core  CPI, absent tobacco, is very tam e. The broader m easures of inflation are m ostly decelerating. Com pensation and productivity are still in a virtuous cycle. So, while risks on the dem and side of the economy have shifted som ewhat to the upside since our last m eeting, developm ents on the supply side rem ain largely favorable. To m e that m eans a som ewhat heighten ed state of alert for policy is called for. How that heightened state s hould be expressed is better di scussed later in the m eeting.

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an. New England’s economy remains m uch the sam e as it h as bee n for the last several m eetings. The region’s job growth continued to be slower than the nation’s but the unem ploym ent rate is well below the nation’s as well. The supply of labor continues to be a concer n. Jobs would grow faster if there were people to  fill them. Wages, however, st ill don’t reflect th is lack o f supply; in fact, alm ost everyw here one is greeted with an ecdotes about how business is coping by offering largely non-wage incentives--t raining and that sort of thing--to keep employees. Manufacturing jobs continue to de cline at a faster pace in Ne w England than 5/18/99 41 nationally. However, merchandise exports are picking up, particularly to the Asian region. Manufacturers also repo rt raw material cost increa ses and not just in oil. Alum inum , copper, silicon, oil- based products, chem icals, paper, leather, and other such inputs are all rising in price. Some manufacturers are now beginning to talk about trying to increase p rofit m argins. They are perhaps not ready to rais e prices as y et, but there is talk abou t price in creases in th e range of 3 to 5 percent. Residential real es tate markets are v ery active, es pecially in the Boston area. Rents are rising precipitously and house prices are up. New hom e building, particularly in the suburbs, is focused on very high-end hom es. Comm ercial real estate is h ealthy as well. We are beginning to see new hotel and office building construction in Boston proper and in the surrounding areas, as well as som e specula tive building. Over the course of the last severa l weeks we’ve had m any opportunities to discuss Y2K issues with banks and businesse s, large and sm all, around New England. In general, banks are confident about their own r eadiness and that of their large customers. On the inventory side, by no m eans is there a consensus on the need to build inventories as the year com es to an end. Rather, most comments reflect a rather balanced view, and many see the challenge not so m uch in Y2K terms but in the norm al inventory planning for year-end. Cash inventories at banks seem  to be a special case, howev er. In that regard there is m uch con cern about consum er pa nic and m uch encouragem ent for whatever p roactiv e statem ents or action the Fed can take to calm  things down. We recently held a m eeting of the Ba nk’s Academ ic Advisory Council which, as you all know, includes two or three Nobe l Prize winners and people from Harvard, MIT, Yale, and so forth. The discussion focu sed on issues re lated to  productivity growth, labor m arket tightness, and asset m arket bubbles . The group was lively, to say the least. But som e consensus was  reached on the need for action that m ight take the wind out of asset m arkets, even in the absence of  tight er monetary policy, perhaps through increased in the day trading operations. On the natio nal scen e, the Greenboo k forecast w ith its high er growth, stable and very low une mploym ent rates, and infla tion that only creeps  up in 2000, strains credibility. Yes, we can ag ree that productivity has im prove d over the last two or three 5/18/99 42 years or so, and that for a tim e anyway th e potential of the econo my to grow without inflation m ight be 3 percent or so vers us the roughly 2½ percent we had thought. However, even given that, with about the sam e growth we see unem ployment falling to the high 3 percent area and infl ation ticking up by year-end 1999. Even if that forecast is viewed with som e level of agnosticism --and here I should say “wolf” along with Al Broaddus--credit conditions are now com ing back to the narrower spreads and are reminiscent of the ease we had last summer. At the sam e time, corporate debt is soaring along with h ousehold debt. True, affordability is better than in the late 19 80s and ban ks are supplying less of the credit and are bett er capitalized, but the signs of excess are beginning to show. Stock m arkets, real es tate markets, a nd corporate and personal debt this economy with concerns about inflation or  concerns about imbal ances and excesses, I think th e concerns are real and action s related to policy corrections need to be considered, if not taken.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Vice Chairm an.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Second District’s econom y continues to gro w at a st urdy pace, with few signs of increased price pressures. Private sector em ploym ent grew  at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter; that’s down from 2.2 perc ent in the fourth quarter of last year. Retailers report that sales were at or above plan in March a nd April, but a bit less robust than in January and February. They also note m odest dec lines in selling pr ices. Residential and commercial real esta te continue to f lourish in the New York City area . Hom e prices have risen sharply and both new construction and rem odeling activities ga ined momentum in the first quarter. While Manhattan’s office m arket rem ained tight in April, ren t inflation has slowed m arkedly from  a rate of more than 20 percent in 1998. Purchasing m anagers indicate th at manufacturing ac tivity continued to expand in April, though at a slower p ace than in M arch. Those in the New York City  area report an uptick in commodity prices and persistent increases in the cost of servi ce inputs. The latest Banker’s Survey shows a pickup in loan dem and, tightening lending stan dards on comm ercial and industrial loans, and further declines in delinquency rates. 5/18/99 43 Looking outside the Second District, let me speak first of the growing view that the international crisis, which began in July 1997, is substantially over. There is no doubt that the crisis is less se vere by a reasonably large degree  than it was last fall, but it surely isn’t over. I believe Japan has m ade virtually no prog ress in restoring growth and has increased its public sector debt to a level that is dangerously high, especially considering the strains on the Japanese public sector that their aging population will bring in the very near future. At our last m eeting I raised a c oncern about what I called in China as a sign that the m assive ec onom ic restructuring of  the state-owned enterprises is not going as well as P remier Zhu Rongji had hoped. The orchestration by the governm ent of the very strong response to  the bom bing of the Chinese Em bassy in Belgrade heightens m y concern. I believe th at the leadership felt--for som e reason no t connected w ith the restructuring but rather to the happenstance of a m emorial date in Chinese history of a student upr ising in the last century on th e fourth of Ma y--tha t they had no choice but to allow the young people to  dem onstrate. But the size of the demonstration I believe also indi cates that the lea dership f elt they had to u se it to le t off pressure from the dom estic situation. And that makes m e even m ore concerned. Korea is growing, but unfortunately one of the results of th e growth has been that the restructuring of the Chaebols, whic h is absolutely necessary for the long-term health of the econom y, is very m uch less certain. And in the b est of cas es it will no t be as complete as one m ight have hoped it would be. Thailand’s recovery is spotty even though it is slightly positive. But the principal author of the recove ry, the finance m inister, seem s to be in increasing political jeopardy. Europe’s growth is sluggish at best, w ith Germ any very weak. As for Russia, even with a bit of  luck, I  think th e most we can h ope is th at it will hold its elf togethe r financially a nd politica lly until the v ery unce rtain outcom e of the Preside ntial and Congressional elections next year. The performance of the dom estic econo my I think gives us a difficult, if deligh tful, challeng e, pe rhaps espe cially in how  to describ e it. Until last Friday’s CP I the perform ance of the econom y had been characterized by good, solid growth fueled by 5/18/99 44 productivity. Now outside econom ists talk of growth as being som ehow dangerous. But it seem s to m e that our job as central bankers is in fact to seek sustained, noninflationary growth. In this regard, I think we have to  be rather careful in our public speeches and statem ents to rem ember that we know a lot m ore than our audiences do. We have to be very careful to note that the enem y is infla tion. It is not solid econom ic growth and it certainly isn’t people finding jobs. Now, what does last Friday’s report of  an increas e in the core CPI tell u s? Clearly ther e is a lot of  noise in the data, a nd one could decide to dism iss them  and just wait for another m onth to see what happens. However, we’ve tried to take apart the data statistically to see if there is any considerab le likelihood that an in crease of that am ount could be giving som e sort of signal that we ought to be concer ned about. And we’ve come to the conclus ion that the sta tistical probab ility is suf ficiently h igh th at the incr ease actua lly is te lling us something im portan t that I believe we de finitely h ave to take it into consideration in our discussion of policy. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. At the last m eeting, and indeed for some time before that, it seem ed that the ri sks to the outlook were balanced, with a slow, steady drift to the upside. That continues with little sign of a significant m oderating trend setting in. Like others, I have been expec ting such a shift for a long tim e, but I would like to be more conf ident than I am  now that it will em erge spontaneously. Industrial production has resum ed vigor ous grow th. We’ve continued to generate a q uarter of a m illion jobs per m onth, which is wonderful of course. Inventories are low, and m ajor cyclical swing factors lik e housing, autos, and capital spending, which should have eased before now, sim ply have not done so. Of course, I should note that we have som e contrary news on housing this m orning. The stock m arket continues to create wealth. Inflation rem ains rem arkably quiescen t, but here again I would like to be m ore confident th at this will c ontinue. The April CPI was a jolt of  yet to be d etermined significance. But beyond that commodity prices  may have be gun to turn and, of course, energy prices already have turned up . Foreign growth should  improve and will have an impact on comm odities and other import ar eas. And unem ploym ent in th e United Sta tes, driven by dem and pressures, appears to be head ed to 4 percent or lower. The m agnific ent 5/18/99 45 productivity gains of recent quarters, even  if they are largely continued, cannot be depended upon to hold these forces at bay indefinitely. At the la st meeting two f actors se emed to inhibit th e Committee f rom considering any action and both of those have  dissipated. Six weeks ago any change by the Fed would have been a great shock to th e market, but not today. The Balkans was an important unknown then but, for better or worse,  it now appears to be headed for a stand-down. To be sure, there are still downside risks and we have no clear and present inflation danger. And we could bask in th is virtuous cycle for som e time yet. The question before us, of course, as it has been, is how best to help prolong this excellent econom ic era for as long as possible. The em ergence of an inflationary surge with some gain in m omentum  woul d surely m ark the begi nning of the end of that. No actual m ove would appear to m e to be required today, but  it may well be tim e to assess how best to start leaning into the wind. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. For the last f ew meetings, I have been trying to determ ine rules of thum b or guides for how we should be m aking our policy, does not work well when it is difficult to define operating targets for inflation or unem ployment. As we have discussed often in this room , this difficulty m ay now be showing up particularly with respect to the unem ploym ent term, given the problem s in identifying the NAIRU. One could m ake a cas e that the NAIRU is 6, 5, or 4 percent. There are several sub stitute appro aches. One is just to drop the unem ploym ent term from  the Taylor Rule, in which case th e rule becom es an inf lation -targeting rule. Under this modification, the Fed would m ove against inflation de viations or in the present circum stances acceler ations of inflation. Anot her ap proach, which I have cham pioned here, is to go to a change rule . Assum ing both inflation and unem ploym ent are in their desired band, the Fed would try to lead the growth in aggregate dem and to be equal to the long-term  growth in aggregate supp ly. This rate used to be about 2.5 percent per year, but now m ay be as high as 3.25 percent if one is a productivity optim ist. A third approach is Bob Parry’s nom inal GDP standard. I haven’t thought about that thoroughly, but I think most of the tim e that would give  the sam e suggestion as m y change approach. 5/18/99 46 Whatever th e approach, I felt we were in policymaking equilibrium  up to our last m eeting. As long as inflation was not accelerating--and it did not seem to be seven weeks ago--the inflation-targeting approach called for no change in the funds rate. As long as th e forecast rate of growth in aggregate d emand was under 3.25 p ercent, as it was then, the change approach did not either. But seven weeks can m ake a difference. The recen t bad n ews on the CPI, even if one adjus ts for special fa ctors, sugg ests a poss ible acceleration,  as do the balance of the Reserve Ban k anecdotes.  But the news on inflation suggests on ly a possible acceleration because  the num bers are for only one m onth and anecdotes are anecdotes.  Yet, there is a definite new inf lation threa t in th e data. The change ru le is also po inting differently because th e Greenboo k growth forecast now averages slightly above 3.25 percen t until this g rowth is contained later o n by a rise in the funds rate in cluded in th e baseline forecast a nd by Y2K. The Blue Chip forecasters are even m ore out of line. Their forecast rate of  growth is 3.8 percent, even further above the long-term  trend. We focus on the disturbing CP I num bers, but in fact  it is true that a number of  addition al signs are beg inning to poin t in the d irection of  a tigh tening of policy. This reasoning is either based on very  recent inform ation or on forecasts, so I suppose there is som e time before we have to act, but not too much. As has been pointed out often in this room , the good recen t perform ance of the eco nomy is no doubt due partly to a feeling that th e Fed will m ove agains t inflation. We risk losing  this credib ility if we tarry too long. There are strong argum ents for doing som ething pretty soon, perhaps a m odest step b ut a clear s tep. The market seem s to expect us to and we’d m iss Jack Guynn’s window of opportunity if we didn’t. Let m e address one final m atter. Suppos e we m ove; does this box us in?  If we were to take the m odest step of introducing a tilt, in m ore than half the recent cases an upward tilt was not followed by a rise in rates. So I don’t in terpret that as boxing us in. If we took the m ore drastic step of actually ra ising rates, we m ight find that a bit harder to undo; but I would still repeat an  argum ent I have m ade here before, which is that a huge policym aking advantage for m onetary policy is its flexibility. We could take advantage of this flexibility. So, I personally do not  find the box-in argum ent very persuasive. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 5/18/99 47 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I, like others, have com e to recognize that the forecast outcom e is quite desirable, but I think the risks are really to the upside. A num ber of peopl e have already talked about th e CPI. I agree with Mike Prell in that the latest CPI num ber does not to me indicate that the day of reckoning has arrived. If one looks at the details, besides apparel, owners equivalent rent, lodging away from  hom e, and airfares seem  to be the dr ivers, along with the category called “other services.” None of those is unim portan t, but on the other hand they don’t necessarily suggest th at inflation --or if you will, the wolf--is at the doo r. To go to ano ther v iew, th ere are som e straws in the wind that I think we do have to be f ocused on. First obviously, as  Governor Gram lich has indicated, alm ost regardless of what one thinks the N AIRU is , it is probably som ewhat higher than 4.2 percent. Therefore, one should expect som e increase in labor costs at som e point. The most recen t ECI would not bear that out, but th at index was o bviously driven in part b y the fact th at comm issions and bonuses turned  down, perhaps because of a slowing in some of the underlying activities. On the other hand, a com plementary measure, the NIPA m easure, showed quite an increase in labor costs, and I don’t think we can necessarily reject that. That is at least one of the cautionary flags that labor costs m ay be rising. The other thing that one might look at, of course, is the aggregates; a few others have talked about the behavior of the m oney supply. I was looking at comm ercial bank credit, which showed str ong loan growth acro ss the board in the fourth quarter of last year and continuing, though somewhat abat ing, growth in the first quarter of this year. There clearly seems to be a great deal of dem and for credit out there and, indeed it turns out, a great deal of  availability of credit. If one looks to the internati onal side, I also think som e of the risks that we have been m ost concerned about have abated. The fa t tail that we were concerned about at the end of last y ear has b ecome a lot thin ner. I agree fully with th e Vice Chairm an’s comment that the d ifficulties abro ad certainly ar e not over yet. All things have not settled down internationally, but a start has been m ade. If one looks at the stripped Brady bond yield, there is som e indicati on, at least from  the markets,  that they expect som e turnaround in that area. 5/18/99 48 One m ight also look at import prices a nd at the BLS indicators. All suggest, particularly industrial supplie s and capital goods, that the de cline in im port prices has bottom ed out. It is a forecast in som e cases, but I think it’s a reality as  well. So that is another one of these tr ends. President Minehan and others  have talked about increases in the prices of  a num ber of different co mmodities. Indeed, if on e looks at sp ot prices, th ose are pushing in the sam e direction. I strongly agree with the comments that the Vice Chairm an made. I don’t think it is our job to lean ag ainst growth; I don’t think it is our job to stop the creation of jobs or th e creation of wealth n ecess arily. But I believ e that we do have to be concern ed about how nom inal GDP is split between solid, sustainable growth ve rsus inflation. And my concerns  now are tha t the risks ar e moving a little m ore to the inf lationary side.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I continue to be impressed by the recen t excep tional growth in productivity. The case for an increase in tren d productivity growth is now m ore compelling after the strength in productivity over the last five quarters--and especially after the last two quarters--than it was based on the data for 1996 and 1997. And I believe the staff’s pattern of increm ental upward steps in trend productivity growth m akes sense, with som e acceleration in produc tivity beginning in late 1995 an d a further acceleration in 1998. My problem  with the staff forecast is that its projection of a 2¼ percent productivity tre nd over the forecast period is just too aggressive for m y taste. This revision to the p roductiv ity forecast bas ically drives their entire forecast. It allows a significan t upward revision in growth over the two-year horizon with little effect on the unemploym ent rate and, hence, on inflation. It is im portant to note, however, as the Greenbook m akes very clear, that the revision of the productivity trend delays but does not rem ove the day of reckoning that is still im plicit in the staff forecast. It is in teresting that th is “day  of reckonin g” seem s to have become the th eme of this m eeting. The tigh t labo r market gets still tighter. The favorable pr ice shocks a re still diss ipating further. Ultim ately , the very tig ht labo r important message. Growth does not cause infl ation; excessive utilization rates do. But another unexpected shift in the productivity trend, as a ssum ed in the Greenbook, im parts 5/18/99 49 another d isinflationary bonus and allows ra pid g rowth to be accomm odated for a while longer with relatively stable inflation. My less optim istic assessm ent of the underlying productivity trend essentially moves forward in tim e the rise in inf lation that  current initial conditions m ake so likely. I do believe that we are at an im portant turning point in this episode. Inflation, after falling throughout the last few years, is stabilizing in  the near term , I believe, and is poised to move higher going forward. That’s h ow I read th e recen t CPI data. The continued favorable financial co nditions and high level of consum er confidence are helping to sust ain robust dem and. While I st ill expect growth to slow somewhat going forward, I believe it is m ore likely that gro wth will be above trend than below trend in the near term , and that gr owth will not spontaneously slow enough over the forecast horizon to p revent a rising trend in inflation. It might be useful to recall the forecast  that m otivated the easings in m onetary policy last f all. At our Septem ber m eeting, the staff projected a 1.2 percent growth rate in 1999, assum ing an easing in m onetary policy.  The current staff forecast has growth almost three tim es as fast. The unemploym ent rate  by this point was projected to be 4¾ percent, ½ percentage point above where it is today. It was projected to rise toward 5½ percen t by the end o f 2000, 1¼ percen tage po ints abov e the current forecast. And equity prices have rebounded by about 40 percen t from  their trough in early October. To be fair, the other m ajor developm ents since the Septem ber forecast were the m uch-sharper-than-expected increase in productivity growth in 1998 and the upward revision to trend productivity going forward. Productivity growth over 1998 turned out to be almost double what the staff projected at the Septem ber meeting--2.7 percent versus 1.5 percent. And the trend productivity assum ption is ½ percentage point highe r now in the staff forecast than the 1¾ percent assum ed at the tim e of the September m eeting. One question we have to ask is wh ether we have becom e sufficiently optim istic about the p roductiv ity trend going fo rward to justify keeping in place the full amount of the decline in the fe deral funds rate that was m otivated by a forecast that has since been so significantly revised and by a set of financial conditions that have so dram atically im proved. The second question we have to ask is whether w e should maintain the current policy setting for the funds  rate if growth continues strong and labor 5/18/99 50 increase thereafter. I will pick up fr om here in my policy position statement.

MS. RIVLIN. I was quoted in a recent New Yorker  article, one of the flood of articles on o ur Chairm an and the new  era, as  being “m ystified in a pleasant way by the recen t perfo rmance of the econom y.” I think that describ es the mood that has captu red this group for quite a while now. Now, we we ren’t m ystified about everything. Much of what was happening was explai nable: the global pressures on commodity prices; the be turning around. Much of the dom estic gr owth was explainable:  the strength of consum er dem and as e mploym ent and incom es rose and stock prices soared; the hou sing boom  as interest rates fel l; the durables boom  as people furnished those houses and bought new cars. Also explainable was the dow nward pressure on prices from  the strong dolla r and c ommodity prices --that f ierce g lobal a nd dom estic com petition. Other parts of the puzzle seem ed less cl ear, basically pleasantly m ysterious. Why was wage growth so subdued in  the face of  labor m arket tightn ess an d the persistent anecdotes around this table about  reported wage increases an d shortages of workers? Above all, why did productivity accelerate so rapidly in the last two quarters?  There were plenty of plausible reas ons, but no certainty that the re asons were the right ones or that they would last. There were cyclical factors, capital deepeni ng, the tim ing of the technology revolution, and new m anagem ent skills  and attitudes. None of it was very conclusive but the num bers were there. Through all the pleasant m ystification, our collective common sense kept sa ying things like “good things don’t last forever.” Some of the positive forces, su ch as the s trong dollar, will tu rn aro und--supply and dem and laws still wo rk. Eventua lly we’ll run out of  workers and wage s will push u p costs and /or consum er prices will begin to rise for som e exoge nous reasons--oil or whatever--and keep going up. And then we m ust be prepared to act. Are we at that point or close to it?  The CPI is worrisom e, but it’s only one month’s number and we are used to a good deal of volatility in that m easure. Cost factors still seem  quite ben ign. Wage growth, though, is not accelerating, at least in the statistics. Productivity is on a roll. The ECI still seem s to be com ing down with profits rising. 5/18/99 51 question is: Do we need to re inforce this with  a hint or a tilt?  I would be inclined to wait, but I can see the case for telling everybody that the Fed is awake.

CHAIRM AN GREENSPAN. Mr. Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. At your last m eeting, m any of you re marked that you were concer ned that inflation would eventually turn up and you therefore saw m onetary policy as m ore likely to firm  than to ease, though you weren' t sure when such action would be appropriate. The question for today' s meeting would seem  to be whether the tim e has drawn closer--perhaps even close en ough to  tighten or, at leas t, to shift to an asymm etric directive and let th e public know right away that the Comm ittee’s concerns about inflation had increased significantly. Many of you m ay view the period ahead as an especially important one for the inflation outlook. As Mike noted, som e of the one-tim e price ebbing or reversing. Among them , energy prices have already risen substantially, the prices of other importan t comm odities have turned around lately, and declines in other im port prices should com e to an end as the effects o f a more stable dollar s ince last summ er and strengthening in foreign econom ies are felt. How dom estic inflation responds to these developm ents m ay help to resolve questions abo ut the causes  of the recen t inflation perfor mance. And the deci sion you m ake could be im portant in determ ining the degree to which th ese price level changes becom e embedded in inflation expectations, th ereby affecting longer-run inflation trends. However, judging the need for a ch ange in the stance of policy has been com plicated by uncertainties ab out the supply side of the econom y and the asso ciated lack o f confidence in forecasts of inflation. Preem ptive actions that turn out to be unwarranted would tend to create unnecessary variations in econom ic activity and increase uncertainty, im peding planning by businesses and households and im pinging on econom ic growth. At the sam e time, however, waiting for com pelling evidence of an actual upturn in inflation before changing policy also would lead to sizable adjustm ents in financial cond itions and econom ic output. In the circum stanc es, the Comm ittee presu mably will want to be a s forward-looking as possible, searching for ear ly signs of changes in inflation prospects and acting, perhaps forcefull y, when it detects tendencies that could reasonably be expected to im pair econom ic perform ance over tim e. 5/18/99 52 Since the last FOMC m eeting, developm ents on the dem and side of the econom y would seem to weigh on th e side of greater concern about future inflation. Demand has been strong and econom ic growth has continued at a pace in ex cess both of prevailing e xpectations and of m ost estim ates of the long-run expansion of potential. Moreover,  indicators of a prospective m oderation in spending are still qu ite tenta tive. Unless productivity is even stronger than the upward revised estim ates of the staff forecast, g rowth will hav e to slow appreciably from  the pace of the last few quarters, if labor m arkets are not to com e under increasing pressure. Changes in financial conditions over  the last six weeks probably have not m aterially added to the restraint on dem and needed to m oderate expansion. Rather, the run-up in yiel ds on Treasury securities in recent weeks seems to owe in p art to the rolling back of  the ea rlier f light to quality as investors appear to have reduced their concerns about risk and incre ased th eir app etite for assum ing it. As a re sult, the nom inal cos t of business credit has rem ained about fl at on average over the interm eeting period. And equity prices have clim bed further, boosting wealth and spurring consum ption. More troubling, the m ovem ents in Tr easury interest rates likely also evidence so me deteriora tion in inf lation expectations, as yields on indexed debt have edged lower and the foreig n exchange value of the dollar has slipped off som e even as the inte rest advantage of U.S. nom inal instrum ents has widened. Of course, som e caution in interpr eting th is deterioration seem s warranted. To some extent, you m ay only be looking in a m irror and m erely seeing the m arket’s perceptions of the Federal Reserve’s concerns, rather than an  independent assessm ent of e merging price pressures. In addition, inflatio n fears m ay not have penetrated Main Street, where the spending decisions are m ade, judging from the lack of move ment in price expectations in  the Mich igan survey. But those judgm ents are difficult, given the in ertia in household decisionm aking and the lags in surveying. Lastly, developm ents in internati onal m arkets m ay also suggest the incre ased po tential f or gr eater inflation pressures. At a m inimum, the resilience of foreign m arkets a nd econom ies suggests that the asymm etrical downside risks that co ncerned the Comm ittee la st fall hav e greatly dim inished. As already not ed, the dollar has edged off recent highs in the exchange market; a persis tence of  this trend would put upward pressure on prices and dem and in the United Sta tes, rev ersing the stabilizing role that the strong dollar and deteriorating trade balance have played over the last seve ral years. For now, the relatively flat dollar means that productive resources in the United States will not be shielded from  the addition al dem and brought about by policy easings and return ing 5/18/99 53 confidence abroad. As a consequenc e, the staff forecast now embodies a sustained growth in exports. But, the econom y has demonstrated a rem arkable capacity to  absorb demand without generating co st and price pressures. Four percent growth in output over the last four quarters has barely nudged down the unem ployment rate. Moreover, som e broad m easures of nom inal wage and price in creas es fell f urther throu gh the f irst quarte r. The extrao rdina ry increase in productivity that has enabled dem and to be m et without appreciably lowering unem ploym ent has also helped to keep cost pressures subdued. Unit labor costs show no sign of picking up, despite an unem ploym ent rate at or below 4½ percen t over the las t year. Moreover, except for energy we have seen only sm all and very recent increase in the prices of commod ities and intermediate goods  in the pipeline. If, in light of this m ixed evidence, the FOMC does not wish to tighten policy a t this tim e but still s ees the inf lation r isks as having r isen, th e Comm ittee should consider whether to adopt an asymm etrical directive toward tightening and whether such  a directive should be announced. It is difficult to predict how m arkets would react to an announcem ent that ha s no p receden t. And details wi ll matter in that the respo nse will depend in part on the wording of the associated announcem ent. The Comm ittee set f or itself  when it re affirmed its dis closure po licy. The Comm ittee said it would reserve such announcements for si gnificant shifts in its thinking, especially where th e absence of an announcement risked seriously m isleading the public and the m arkets. With the bar set a t that relatively high level, the m arket is li kely to build in substantial odds on tightening at the June or the Augus t meeting if the Comm ittee announces  a tilt, perhaps on the order of 50-50. Friday’s  data moved m arket participants in the direction of exp ecting an announcem ent of a tilt today and rais ed th eir as sessm ent of the chances of policy firm ing in com ing months. But m arket prices do not  yet incorporate 50-50 odds of a tightening u ntil the f all. The Comm ittee m ay well be in a situ ation in which, because of its announcem ent policy, it cannot leave m arkets unaffected by its decision today, even if it follow s the strong m arket consensus and m akes no change in the stance of policy. Announcing the Comm ittee’ s heightened  concern abo ut inf lation is like ly to ra ise ra tes; omitting su ch an announcem ent is lik ely to lower them . If in fact the Comm ittee is now m ore concerned about inflation and hence m ore likely to give serious cons ideration to tightening at the next few m eetings, it m ight consider adop ting and publishing an asymmetric directive. In the contex t of greater inflation risk s, the resu lting further 5/18/99 54 back-up of yields and restraint on equity prices w ould tend to contribute to econom ic stability; a reversal of rece nt rate increases and equity price directive m ight be seen as m isleading markets in  that it would lead to a structure of m arket interest rate s that inadequately reflected the Comm ittee' s assessm ent of  the econo mic situatio n. A tilt wo uld be tak en as indicating  that the Committee m ight be especially sensitive to inform ation suggesting that price pressu res were likely to build. With the incom ing data are likely to be relatively in tense a nd m arkets volatile. But, to the extent particip ants understood your conc erns and hence could anticipate your actions reasonably w ell, the resulting price m ovem ents should be constructive and stabilizing, on balance. If, on the other hand, th e Comm ittee were not s o sure inflation risks had risen appreciably, it m ight choose to  retain the symm etrical directive. The Comm ittee m ight be hesitant to act before it had m ore concrete inform ation that p rices were likely  to accelerate. Such eviden ce could come from  data on costs and prices or from  adde d pressures on resources-­that is, a further decline in the une mploym ent rate. Because n either of these sets of indicators has m oved much of late, the Comm ittee m ight believ e that it was unlikely to get de finitiv e enoug h evidence in the next few m onths on these pressures to take action. If this were the Comm ittee’ s view, then publishin g a tilted directive and encouraging the misleading and could lessen the power of asymmetry to convey inform ation over tim e. Indeed, som e rally in credit m arkets, which would be expected to accom pany no announcem ent, might well acco rd with such a less concerned view of the infl ation outlook, particularly if the Comm ittee saw the sharp  reaction to Friday’s d ata as overdon e. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions for Don? 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Don, since you spent a fair am ount of tim e on whether we should go asymm etric or symmetric, my ques tion has to do with the wording in the direc tive tha t relates to the tilt. The way the current wording reads, th e tilt applies to “the intermeeting period ;” it d oes not say that we  might act on the tilt at th e nex t meeting or the m eeting af ter tha t. How im portan t is th e fact that it is conf ined to the interm eeting period and not longer term in influencing your  thinking of whether we should put that language in the directive? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. The Comm ittee has discussed at length whether it should change the wording in the d irective to be less  speci fic about the intermeeting period and has had 5/18/99 55 trouble finding a consensus about how to m ake that change since everybody seem ed to have a different interpretation of the m eaning of asymm etry. I think that problem  could be handled in the annou ncem ent that accom panie s a shift to asymm etry if that’s the way you choose to go. First, I wouldn’t m ention th e words “over the interm eeting period” in the announcem ent; secondly, I m ight put in wo rding about looking at inform ation “over the com ing months.” If the announcem ent is cl ear, I doubt that people will care abou t the specific wording in th e directive. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Further questions for Don?  If not, let m e get started on the policy side. I would lik e to differentiate between hist ory and forecas ts. The histo ry at this particular stage, with on ly very s light variat ions that have su rfaced anecd otally in th e last two or three weeks, is unequivoc ally that of a period of declin ing rates of increase in unit costs. In fact, the num bers for the nonfinan cial corporate sector have gone down to zero change in total unit costs over the four qua rters ending in the fi rst quarter of 1999. I don’t recall a four-quarter num ber that low in the current expansion. The zero change reflects quite subdued growth in unit labor costs and a decline in  the level of unit nonlabor costs. Prices generally  are flat, but they have been  associated with a rise of modest dimensions in profit m argins, on average, in the past few quarters. In the m anufacturing area where we have  data through April, we see sim ilar results in that unit costs rem ain very subdue d. Indeed, the m onthly num bers on costs are quite soft and profit m argins were rising signifi cantly further in April. All the reports on projected profits that we pick up from secur ity analysts point to an im provem ent in the second quarter. I don’t m ention that as a fo recast but as a rep ort of what people are saying. The data indicate that productivity continues to acceler ate. Indeed, we have very little evidence as yet that the upsurge in cyc lically adjusted productivity has leveled out. The first s ign that that is  occurring may be reflected in the lon g-term  earnings forecasts of the security analysts, which as you know have moved up about  2 percentage points. The earnings forecasts and p roductivity growth rate s may differ, but the two are in terrelated. Because we are talking about a forecast with no change in lab or’s share, an increase in expected earnings over five years h as to show up either in an accelera tion in the rate of 5/18/99 56 inflation, in the rate of producti vity growth, or in the rate of  hours growth. The latter is extrem ely unlikely, strictly as a m atter of dem ographics. There is very little evidence to date of  a pickup in inflati on expectations, and until v ery recently the n otion r egarding pricing p ower in the business s ector has be en uniformly that it is z ero. Theoretically, it is  possible tha t foreign af filiates are in creasing their share of the earnings. But given what  has happened to oil, that seem s doubtful. Therefore, we are led to the conclu sion that the earnings ex pecta tions a re essentia lly projections of productivity grow th. The rate of growth in  productivity has been rising during the past several years. In the past two or three months, however, we have seen some indications that the growth rate m ight be leveling out. That suggests that companies are no longer telling se curity analysts that productivity growth is on an ever rising trend. If we look strictly at the current data, what we end up with are increasing profit The latter com e from  the figures on aggreg ate wages and salaries in the N IPA data divided by hours or they com e from  the averag e hourly ea rnings in the p ayroll data; both show a very dram atic drop in the rate of gain  in av erage hou rly labor cos ts. I believe it was you, Roger, who was raising the issue of  the NIPA data; those data are obviously picking up a larger aggregate hours figure. The trouble with the NIPA data is that we are dividing an uncertain num erator by an uncertain denom inator, and the result is perfection ! 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. That’s a fair point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The t rouble unfor tunately is that, as a number of you have commented, the ECI cost data are probably not picking up a number of the nontrad itional ways of paying people--training costs, sto ck options, and a few other form s of com pensation. But leaving aside the un certainties that are involved in m easuring wages, the interesting issue is  why wages are not rising fast er if productivity is doing what all the evidence suggests it is  doing. We have a unique anom aly. Nonetheless , granted all of  this, we still h ave ero sion in th e pool of people seeking work who do not have jobs. To be sure, that num ber has not gone down as fast in the last y ear as it did in preced ing years, but it is still going  down at a 500,000 annual 5/18/99 57 rate. That is a substan tial decline. The curr ent le vel is at or b elow its p revious low in  the history of this series, which goes back to 1970. We know that has to have inflationary consequences at som e point even if th e acceleratio n in productivity has d amped the influence of tight labor m arkets on wage increases. I also find a bit of an anom aly in th e anecdotes concerning w hat is happening to prices. A num ber of you have ref erred to anecdotal reports that it is now easier to raise some prices. I suspect that m ay be right, given the extent of overa ll vib rancy in th is econom y. Nonetheless , participan ts in the Bus iness Council m eeting in W illiam sburg said the other day that such pricing behavior  abso lutely was n ot occur ring and that the y had not seen it for quite a long period of tim e. I don’t know whether that phenom enon is just s tarting to be built in to the p ricing struc ture. There is so me evidence that comm odity pr ices m ay have tilted up to so me extent after declining earlier and then flattening out. Coppe r and alum inum  prices are up modestly, but they are well beneath their rece nt highs. Steel scra p prices are little changed. It is hard to find anything resem bling upwar d price pressures on non-oil commodity prices. Nonetheless, I can’t get away from the fact th at the growth in aggregate dem and still exceeds th e rate of incr ease in productivity and is continu ing to put pressure on the system. I find it very di fficult to uncover any useful evidence that suggests the increase in aggregate dem and is slowing. Obviously, we are absorbing goods from  abroad at an  unpreceden ted pace. This situation could go on for a while , as Governor Kelley has said, but credulity gets strained m ore and m ore the longer it goes on. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is an increasing im balance here that we have to address. While I am not ready to move rates, I do think that those of you who have raised the issue of moving to a tilt toward res traint h ave the argu ments strongly on your side. And if we do go to a tilt in this particular environm ent, I can’t see how we can avoid announcing it. I think failing to do so would be exceptionally confusing to the m arket. As far as I can see, we do not have strong evidence of ri sing inflation, especi ally if we m ove awa y from  what  I consider to be a flawed consum er price index. If we look at the im plicit P CE deflator, the numbers don’t look as bad. Indee d, the April rise in the PCE  deflator is 0.3 for the core and 0.5 for the total. The three-m onth average fo r the core P CE is a rise at an annual rate 5/18/99 58 of 1.1 percent. This is not evidence that somehow we are far behind the curve, that inflation pressures are mushroom ing, and that we had better move. I see very little to be lost at this stage in going to an announced tilt except perhaps in using a tool that we m ight be able to use m ore effectively later. What it does in my view is to position us to m ove in light  of a lot of sm all indications in the CPI that other words,  even adjus ting for the measurem ent problem s in the CPI with  regard to th e abnorm al weight that it puts on apparel and on owner-occupied rents, there are indica tions in the la test numbers that the dec line in inf lation is  com ing to a halt. The re is very little ev idence that I  can see that the ra te of inflation is still m oving down. But we also have seen very few, if any, signs that it is turning up. And therefore I think we will be in a position where we can m ove if necessa ry at the next m eeting or the m eeting after that and not be caught by what  I consider to be a relative ly low, but by no m eans zero, probability of having to move suddenly. We have been in a s ituation for s o long where we have seen labor m arkets tighten continuous ly with nothing happe ning to prices that we m ay lull ourselves into the belief that m arkets don’t turn quickly. They have turned quickly in th e past. Such  behavior will not show up in our models largely because models, by having fixed coefficients reflecti ng average characteristics, cannot produce a rapid change. But m arkets can. And even though I think such an outcom e has a low probability, I believe it finally is  time f or us to start to posi tion ourselves. I am far from convinced that we will need to act o n an asy mmetric directiv e in the n ear term . But not having such a directiv e in place and then being forced to act b y events that com e upon us fairly quickly, which m ay mean acting during an interm eeting period, could in m y view create m arket forces that m ight ultim ately be  destabilizing. So while I sense that it is definitely prem ature to move rates, it is by no  means prem ature to m ove toward a tilt and to announce it as well. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH. Mr. Chairm an, I fully support your conclusions and the associated reasoning. I believe it would be very ill advised to raise rates today. Such a m ove would be taken as a knee-jerk reaction to the CPI num ber regarding which all of us have som e questi ons. But to fail to adopt an asymm etric direc tive to ward f irming also would be ill advised, and it would be very ill advised not to 5/18/99 59 publish such a decision. Oddly enough, by publishi ng a tilt toward tightening, I think we actua lly will have m ore flexib ility. It is not neces sarily the ca se tha t we will in f act ha ve to tigh ten, th ough I am  a little m ore inclined to  think we will have to do s o than you just suggested, Mr. Chairm an. But I believe adopt ing a tilt and shocking the m arket without preparing it would create som e very seri ous problem s for the econom y, which we can easily avoid by announcing the tilt. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Rivlin. 

[SECTION]

MS. RIVLIN. Mr. Chairm an, I agree with your proposal. I don’t see strong econom ic reasons for not waiting another m onth before m aking your proposed change even though  only a tilt is  involved. After all,  the only really disturb ing econom ic news is the core CPI for one m onth. But we m ay have to move in the next few months and, if so, I have concluded that psychologically th ere are som e good reasons for moving to a published tilt now. Indeed, if a slowdown in  the expansion is in  prospect and we reinf orce its probability with the h igher ra tes and  lower equity prices tha t might follow our announcem ent of a tilt, th e markets m ay do our work for us and we may not have to move at all. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, what you are proposing is certainly a step in the right direction, but m y preference would be to go ahead and m ove the funds rate up ¼ percen tage point today. I would respect fully disagree with Bill McDo nough about the interpretation of such a move as a knee-jerk  response. Some people m ight read it that way, but I really don’t think it has to be seen that way. As I have said at som e earlier m eetin gs, I believe there h as been a case for tightening our policy for som e time now on a lo t of different grounds. We have talked a lot about productivity trends at  this meeting. To m e it seems increasingly likely that trend productivity growth is ri sing. Some may see that as a reason to stand pat on policy, but higher trend productivity grow th will lead at least som e households and businesses to expect higher incom es in the future. Some are going to try to act on that expectation now by borrowing to increase their spending even though the actual increase in output is not yet available. In that situa tion, interest rates ne ed to rise to keep dem and from  becom ing excessive. The extraordinary grow th in dom estic dem and of late seem s clear if one looks 5/18/99 60 at a m easure like p rivate dom estic fin al purch ases, which grew at an annual rate of 7½ percen t in th e first qua rter after growing at a rate of 6½ percen t last year. That has to be above any reasonable estim ate of the sustainabl e growth in output, and it is one reason for tightening policy. Beyond that, as Governor Meyer m entioned earlier, when we last reduced the funds rate in Nove mber, I believe a lot of pe ople around this table saw that m ove as extra insurance, so to speak, against the possibili ty that the financial difficulties we had experienced would underm ine the general ec onomy. Those fears clearly have not materialized, so I think ther e is a case for taking back that last rate reduction. With regard to the CPI f or April, ag ain it is only one num ber. But it com es at a time when we are already on the lookout for ri sing inflation on the basis of a variety of other developm ents and at a tim e when financ ial m arkets clearly are taking the risk of higher inflation seriously. We have fought l ong and hard to win the credibility we now have, and going forward I think our credibili ty can be an enormously powerful weapon for keeping inflation under wraps at m inimum cost in term s of lost output and jobs. I don’t preten d to know exactly what we have to do now to preserve th at credibility, bu t I have a sense that we need to show the flag, get back in the ball game--whatever m etaphor you want to use--and to do so m ore decisively than by just m oving to a tilt. So, I would favor alte rnative C. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Your recomm endat ion of announcing a tilt captures m y sense of what we ought to do today. I think it strikes the right balance between showing that we are indeed awake at the switch an d at the same tim e showing the appropriate restraint. Even m ore importantly, I believe it p osition s us e ither to ac t on the tilt in the f uture, should that be necessary , or not to act. But I do think it sends the right sig nal, and I fully support what you are proposing.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. I support your recom mendation as well, Mr. Chairm an, and I would echo the comm ents that Pres ident Boe hne has just m ade. I also id entify with President McDonough’s comment that we m ay get an added kick from  the announcem ent effect since it will b e the first tim e that we  inform  the public about  a chang e in the tilt 5/18/99 61 immediately after a m eeting. In addition to  the argum ents that you m ade, I am  pleased that su ch an announcem ent will no t leave all of us vulnerab le to having our individu al public statem ents or even our body language pick ed apart over this ne xt period. I think a leak would be a m ost unf ortunate wa y for peopl e to lea rn abo ut a change in the tilt, an d I see that risk as a very important reason to m ake the announcem ent.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, I felt last time and I feel now that we could appropriately identify an imm ediate move as an unwinding of our earlier effort to stabilize financial m arkets--an effort at whic h we were successful. I would prefer that explanation. At the sam e time, I would buy your recomm endation today in term s of the tilt. I would be careful about what the a nnouncem ent says with regard to the period to which the tilt m ay apply, whether it is the interm eeting period or som e longer period, but I certain ly would accep t your tilt recomm endation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I certainly concur with your recomm endation. I am a little concerned, however , about the interpretation of the tilt. In my view the Comm ittee should not feel that it locks us in to an early m ove. Everyone no doubt recalls that last summer our directive was asymm etric toward tightening for three meetings from late March until m id-August a nd we never did tighten. Subsequently,  of course, we eased in the fall. Something unforeseen could happen again. We should be open to that possibility and rem ain flexible. One further thought, Mr. Chairm an: I would hope that in our public statem ent we will de- emphasize th e April CPI num ber and stress the un derly ing trends that I th ink are really motivating us. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I support your recommendation for no change in the federal funds  rate target and enthusiastically support your recomm enda­tion for a move to an asymm etric directive that would be announced after the conclusion of this m eeting. The balance of risks in my view is toward co ntinued strong growth, possibly even tighter labor m arkets, and ultim ately higher inflation. As other m embers of 5/18/99 62 the Comm ittee have noted, a case could be m ade for an inc rease in the f unds rate to reverse some of our easing during the fall in light of the upward revision to the forecast and the im provem ent in financial conditions since that tim e. It is esp ecially im portant in my view for  us to respond to any further tighten ing in labo r markets o r to any incr ease in inflation b ecause I be lieve the unem ploym ent rate  is m ore like ly to dec line than to rise in the near term. And bec ause I think it is m ore lik ely tha t inflation will be rising ra ther than falling over the next several m onths and quarters, I believe an asymm etric direc tive is appropriate at this time. Long-term  interest rates have risen in response to the Chairm an’s recent sp eech and in response to the recent CPI and industr ial production data. Some might argue that this rise in long-term  interest rates alone  provides a desired rest raint and rem oves the necessity of Fed action. However, the rise  in long-term  interest rates reflects the expectation of bond m arket par ticipants that m onetary po licy will tighten in the not too distant future, presum ably in response to the c onsiderations that I ha ve just outlined. The bond m arket is in effect pricing in relati on to th e market forecast and our perceived policy reaction function. Such  preemptive pricing in the bond m arket is in my view desirable and stabilizing, but it will occur only if  we consiste ntly r atify the expectatio ns on which it is based when those expectations m atch our own. There has been som e concern that the first tim e we m ove to a bias and announce the change will have an unusually large effect on the m arket. But today’s meeting provides an opportunity to implem ent such a m ove with a relatively m odest effect precisely becau se the bond m arket has already priced in som e expe ctation of a near-term  policy m ove. While there is very little or no expectation of a change in the federal funds rate target at today’s meeting, financial m arket participants are to an important degree expecting the FO MC to m ove to an asymmetr ic directiv e. In fact, I would expect that the response to no a nnouncem ent, which m ight be viewed by the response to an announcem ent of a cha nge in the bias. Thank you.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Mr. Chairm an, I too th ink that your recomm endation is a step in the right direction. But, like P resident Broaddus, I would be m ore comfortable 5/18/99 63 with an increase of 25 basis points in the funds  rate that would in effect undo the last public statem ent without reference to the CPI increase; we could say that it reflects the stability--in fact, the im provem ent--that has oc curred in our financia l markets sin ce last fall. Looking back to a year ago, we had an asymm etric directive toward tightening for three m onths or so, as Governor Kelley has rem inded us. We were facing an outlook at that tim e that we never e xpected to be as good as the si tuation we are facing now. We have witnessed a recovery  from  many of the problem s that the econom y was experiencing during the fall. I for one hope th ey cannot be repeated, at least in term s of their seriousness. At this point I think we are looking at underlying levels of de mand and labor m arket pressures th at are far greater than  those we were s eeing last year at this tim e and a m onetary policy that is definitely easier. So in m y vie w there is a good case to be  made for  increasing the funds rate and taking ba ck that last d ecrease. If we go ahead with the tilt, wh ich appea rs to be the like ly action at this m eeting, I agr ee that announcing our decision would be desirable. Don Kohn m ade one striking comment , I thought, about the fact that there would undoubtedly be a rally if we did not m ake an announcem ent. That is the last th ing we need at this point. So, if  we go ahead with the tilt, we definitely should publish.

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I support your recommendation. The m ost importan t thing to m e in all of this is th at we m ake an announcem ent because I believ e it is very im portant at this stage that we give the public som e sense of our thinking in the current environm ent. I would second Mike Kelley’s em phasis on inserting som e thoughts in that statem ent about  longer-term  trends as opposed to focusing on the latest CPI num ber.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I believe that  the r eference to the tilt need s to be announced this afternoon. That is the correct thing to do. I also associate m yself with those who believe that a modest firm ing should be put in place now. I’d like to talk briefly ab out the analysis that under lies m y views on policy. I don’t th ink there is any q uestion that fi nancial co nditions are accomm odative as measured by m oney growth, the ease of financ ing in m arkets, and the behavior of the equity m arkets. The issue is how fast the economy can grow, assum ing there is an ample amount of money. We have talked a lot abou t productivity, bu t I think it is im portant to keep in m ind that one thing that econom ic theory tells us about productivity growth is that it determ ines the gap between wage grow th and price growth; it does not determine the level of either one. With the uncertain ty about productivity growth, I believe w e ought to be splitting it about down the m iddle. That is, if we have a favorable upward surprise in productivity growth, we should let half of it go into wage s and half of it com e out of prices rather than try to hold price inflation where it is a nd let it all show through in faster wage growth. There is an argum ent for taking some of it out of prices. In any event, there is no question that  the outlook for productivity is subject to a great deal of uncertainty going forward. There are lots of different ways of form ulating this. To m ake it very sim ple and straightf orward, if we look at this in term s of a Phillips curve issu e, there is a lot of concentration on growth or on the gap or whether  the natu ral rate of the N AIRU has changed. In fact, I think the expectations co mponent of  the P hillips cu rve is at leas t as important and that the best wa y to understand what has happ ened in the last couple of years is to say that expectations have trum ped the gap. The reason that we have been able to run an econom y as well as it has unfolded is that there have been firm expectations of continuing low inflation. But expectations will not continue to trum p the gap forever. The underly ing realities of th e pressu re on resou rce m arkets will gradually take hold; and once we lose the advantage on expectations, I belie ve it is going to be painful and difficult to get it back. So, m y policy recomm endation stem s to a large extent from  the view that allowing an y substantia l risk th at price expec tations will ge t away f rom us is a ve ry gr eat 5/18/99 65 risk to run. In the staff’s inflation for ecast--thoug h we can always quibble over th e point estim ates here becau se we all know what the standard errors are--I think the probability of an outcom e ½ point higher on the inflati on ra te is sub stantially high er than the probability of  ½ point lower on the inf lation rate. And given that a ssess ment of the probabilities, it seem s to m e that we need an a ppropriate policy bias to reflect th at bias in possible outcom es. If we do not tighten policy soon and if for whatever reason we are unlucky and the ra te of in flation rises,  we will the n face the real risk tha t expecta tions will start to turn agains t us. We will find ourselves playi ng catch-up. And once the m arket com es to believe that we are falling behi nd, our effort to catch up is going to be very painful for the would be easy for us to reduce the funds rate la ter. That is part of the analysis underlying my view that to raise rates in present circum stances is in some sense a safety play. I anticipate a tightening trend. Some people have expressed the hope that we won’t have to m ove, but for those of us who believe that som e tightening is going to be required, I think we need to have som e idea of how m uch that is going to be. That to m e is im portant because onc e we are se en to be in m otion it is po ssible tha t the markets will move long-term  interest rates higher than we might consider justified. I think we are now at about the outer tim e lim it of being able to  make a credible case that we are sim ply undoing som e of the policy easing f rom last fall.  The m ore distant in  time that becomes, the le ss credible it will b e to appea l to th at as a way of providing som e cap on m arket expectations of where this ti ghtening process m ight take us. But if we have som e bad luck on some of the inflation num bers com ing in over the next few m onths, I believe we will find it d ifficult to m anage under those ci rcumstances. And that is why I believ e it would be better to get ahead of the curve now.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Mr. Chairm an, I agree with your recomm endations of an asymm etric tilt and an immediate announcem ent. I am concerned about the high level of aggregate dem and and the related outlook for infl ation. It is important  that we show we are concerned about inflation and are ready to take action. In my  view, this step will help us to m aintain our cr edibility. 5/18/99 66 There were a couple of considerations  mentioned by Don Kohn that I thought were im portant. He said if we change the tilt we should announce it if we think: (1) it is a significant change in our thinki ng; and (2) if  the a bsence of this step would m islead the public. My assessm ent is that the cu rrent situat ion fits both of those criteria. So, I think it is im portant that we change the tilt and announ ce it right away.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, since we m et in March we have had a number of conflicting signals about the futu re course of core inflation. Taken as a w hole, however, I believe there are upside risks to  inflation, although they m ay not be sufficient to warrant an increase in the funds rate at the present time. I must adm it it would not take m uch more evidence of upside risk to convince m e to raise the rate. So, I would be enthusiastic in supporting an announced upward tilt to the directive at this tim e. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I, like othe rs, support your recomm endation for a publicly announced tilt toward tighten ing. I believe the risks, supported by som e very early signs in the data, are sufficient for us to change at least our tilt. In my view publicly  announcing  the tilt wi ll give us sufficient room  to m ove if the cost pressures do em erge, but they are not, as  you observed, yet evident. That doesn’t mean that we should wait until they becom e full-fledged inflationary pressures, but I do think we have a little more tim e. As others have indicated, the m arkets have already priced in som e of this policy tightening, so we need not be concer ned about an outsized reactio n on their part, although there m ay be som e as Don Kohn has indicated. Like others here, I would be concerned that if we don’t m ove to asym metry and announce it now, there m ight be an undesirable reaction in both the equity and the fixed incom e markets. Also, I believe not changing the tilt would, in fact, be viewed as an indication th at we are not being vigilant to early inflationary signs and that might lead to som e small erosion in o ur cred ibility. For all these reasons, I support your recomm endation.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. As probably everyone knows and as Peter F isher’s charts s howed, the level of interm ediate- and long-term  governm ent 5/18/99 67 yields in May of 1999 is alm ost exactly wher e it was in May of 1998. So, in looking at nominal interest rates and the yield curve, we are right b ack where we were a year ag o, and I thought policy was too expansionary then. I still am  from the school of thought that believ es a steeper y ield curve ind icates a m ore expansionary monetary  policy rathe r than one that is less expansionary, a nd th e yield cu rve is distinctly steeper today than it was a year ago. Governor Meyer said that the m arkets m oved the rates back up in expectation of our tightening policy--raising the funds rate. I hope so because I don’t like the alternative explanation. That explanation would be that th e markets don’t expect us to tighten, and for that reas on interest rates ha ve risen and will keep on ris ing. That would be especially disturbing. The shock of last August and Septembe r was exactly that--an external shock that is unpredictable by its very nature. Those things happen. They have happened before. For a tim e they lead the central bank to suspend the norm al considerations that go into its monetary policy decisions. I strongly suspect that it happened to the Comm ittee with the onset of th e Gulf W ar in 1990. It certainly happened in the fall of 1987 with the stock m arket crash in O ctober of that year. I dread all Octobers, and since we are having a m eeting this October, I am going to dread it, too. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Let’s all go away for October! 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Right, let us just skip Oct ober. But I still b elieve in long lags, in variable lags too, but esp ecially in long lags. I think our policy stance on balance has been m ore expansionary than was necessary or  desirable for the environm ent in which we found ourselves. I say that even  though we would have had to  interrupt the policy that I would have thought app ropriate a year ago becau se of what happened in August and We are not back on that track and in m y view monetary policy  right now is m ore expansionary than desirable. With regard to the issue of announcing a change in the tilt, I am  bothered by the idea of saying we have cocked the gun but hope that we don’t have to use it. That bothers m e a lot. I don’t like that practic e in foreign policy let alone m onetary policy, namely telling people that if one m ore thi ng happens--I don’t know what that one m ore thing is--we are going to use this  tool. Also, once we adopt an asymm etric directive and 5/18/99 68 announce that decision--with th e understanding that we are providing inform ation about a shift in our thinking about policy--then I a ssum e at a later point we would have to announce a decis ion to rem ove the tilt if we  determ ine we will not use it. To do otherwise w ould be to m isinform  the m arketplace. Announcing the adoption of a tilt and not being very clear about the circum stances under which we would or would not use it is in my view going to lock us into m aking further announcem ents. I am not sure whether such a pra ctice will g ive bette r information to the m arkets or  not.

MR. GRAM LICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I’ll support the notion of instituting a tilt and announcing it. I am very glad we established this disclosure procedure b ecause I thin k it giv es us the ab ility to  communicate m ore clearly. I am sitting four-f ifths of the way from  you to Al Broaddus both geographically and policywise. [Laughter] I have som ething lik e four-fifths agreem ent with him  and also with Bill Po ole, Cathy Minehan, an d Jerry Jo rdan that we s hould be raising rates. Four-fifths is not 100 percent so I won’ t dissent, but that’s where I am . 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think th ere is a consensus among the voting members in favor of alternative B asymm etric and an announcem ent. There is a question about the reference to the “interm eeting period”  in the directive. I have a prelim inary version of a press statem ent that we would use if the vot e on changing to asymm etry is affirmative. It does talk a bout “the com ing m onths” as dis tinct from  “the interm eeting period.” Does anybody have strong views as to what we m ight or m ight not do about the language in the directive on the presum ption that we go ahead on the asymmetry?  We have to decide that now because legally we  have to vote on a specific d irective. Don Kohn, do you have a recomm endation as to how we ought to handle this? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Well, as my answer to President Hoenig suggested, I think you could go ahead with the present wording of the directive. It strikes m e that people m ay not want to change the wording on the fly but  would prefer to have a chance to think about the p ros and cons before reach ing a deci sion. So the Comm ittee may want to retain the current wording for now as long as the press statem ent makes the intent clear. 5/18/99 69 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, why don’ t we just leave the directive as is, but leave the issu e open in the event that we  want to go further. So, read the directive as is.

MR. BERNARD. I am reading from pa ge 13 of the Bluebook: “To promote the Comm ittee’s long-run objectiv es of price stability and sustainable econom ic growth, the Comm ittee in th e imm ediate future seeks conditions in reserve m arkets consistent with m aintaining the federal funds rate at an  average of around 4¾ pe rcent. In view of the evid ence curren tly av ailab le, the Comm ittee believes that prospective developm ents are m ore likely to warrant an increase than a decrease in the federal funds rate operating objective during the interm eeting period.”

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let me read  a proposed statem ent and get your reactions to it. “While the FOMC did not  take ac tion tod ay to alter the sta nce of monetary policy, the Committee was concerne d about the potential for a buildup of inflationary im balances that could underm ine the favorable perform ance of the economy and therefore adopted a directive that is tilted toward the pos sibility of a firm ing in the stance of m onetary policy. Trend increases in costs and core prices have generally remained quite subdued. But dom estic fina ncial m arkets have recovered and foreign econom ic prospects have im proved since the easi ng of m onetary policy last fall. Against the background of already-tight dom estic la bor m arkets and ongoing strength in dom estic demand in excess of productivity gains, the Co mmittee recog nizes the need to be alert to 5/18/99 70 developm ents over com ing m onths that m ight indicate that financial conditions m ay no longer be consistent with  containing inflation.”
