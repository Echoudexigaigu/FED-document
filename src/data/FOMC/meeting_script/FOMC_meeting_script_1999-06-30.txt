CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objection. Mr. Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I will be referring  to the usu al package of colored charts that is in front of you. 1/ Mr. Chairm an and m embers of the Comm ittee, four perceptions are curren tly influencing fin ancial m arket behav ior. It seem s to m e that each of these perceptions contains certain elem ents of truth but also, I fear, certain fallacies that cou ld com e back to haunt u s. These perception s are: First, that signs of a pickup in Eu ropean growth are causing a rise in expectations for a European Central Ba nk (ECB) rate hike later this year; second, that the strength of the U.S.  econom y has been the m ajor factor causing the weakening o f the euro ov er the las t six m onths; th ird, th at the Japanese m onetary authorities can be relied upon to stabilize the yen with verbal and official intervention; and four th, th at the leve ls of interest rates and of econom ic activity in the Un ited States will be principally determ ined by the words and deeds of  the m embers of the Federal Open perceptions in turn. In the ch arts on the firs t page of the package, yo u can see th at the forward rates jum ped a bit on th e Committee’s announcem ent on May 18 but stabilized or even rallied a bit until May 27 and then began to back up through m ost of June. I will return to  the issu e of the course of U.S. interest rates later when I discuss the bond m arket. For now, I would like to focus on the euro forward rates, w hich appear to have followed U.S. rates up. Euro-area 6-m onth and 9-m onth forward 3-month deposit rates are up 25 basis points or so since your last meeting. There have b een a num ber of positive s igns for the euro-11 econom y, including greater-than-expected  first-quarter GDP in Germ any, increased G erman m anufacturing orde rs, and im provem ent in Germ an and French business sentim ent. But some  less upbeat data have also been reported in Europe, including an increase in Germ an une mploym ent in 1 / A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Fisher is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 1) 6/29-30/99 2 bottom ing in the European econom y have em erged, I don’t think that trans lates directly in to concrete expectations of an ECB rate hike. Rather, evidence of a slight pickup in activity coupled with strong expectations f or U.S. rate increases, again st the b ackdr op of a weak euro, have com pletely eliminated any expectations of further rate cuts by the ECB and in that sense have increased the risks of a rate hike. But this has left euro-a rea interest rate m arkets without any direction, leaving them highly susceptible to being dragged around by the m ovement in U.S. rates. Unfortunately, I did not include in these charts a panel on the Germ an yield cu rve. But in the p eriod since your last m eeting the 10-year Germ an bund a nd, m ost surp risingly, the 2-year Germ an bund have m arched along with our yield curve alm ost in lock step as they too have backed up over the last 60 days. It may turn out that the euro-area econom y has turned and  will pick up  steam  from  this poin t forward, but most of the backup in euro-area interest  rates appears to m e to be a case of their following our lead. In the bo ttom panel of  this char t, which depicts Japanese forward rates, you can see that the 9-m onth forward 3-month rate backed up following the report of a much strong er-th an-exp ected GDP num ber for the first quarter. Then, it seem s to me, the data go berserk in this panel. Even though we have checked and doubl ed checked them , this is the best we have been able to com e up wit h. But you should also recognize that this sc ale is twice th at of the othe r panels on th is chart in  order to provide any view at all of Japanese interest ra tes. There is  a level of noise in the Japanese m arkets that I d on’t even p retend to und erstand. But I will ho ld with m y ass essment that I don’t thin k anyone really expects the Bank of Japan to raise rates any tim e soon. There is m uch seesawing in views about what to expect in the Tankan survey. Every few days authorities step forward to say they still think the econom y is weak, and this has been going on for som e time. Turning to the next chart, the st eady weakening o f the euro ag ainst the dollar since its launch in January has been widely attributed to the surprising strength of the U.S. econom y. Obviously, the relative strength of the U.S. econom y ver sus the Europ ean econom ies has played a role in the m ovements of the dollar against th e euro but it does not explain the weakness of the euro ag ainst the yen . It strikes m e that if one wants to make the case that Europe’s growth di fferentia l with the United Sta tes ha s been the principal cause of the euro’s  weakness, one needs to look at the relationships am ong all three currencies.  If one does that, I think it is evident that the yen has been play ing a dom inant role, both in the last six months and over the last two years. 6/29-30/99 3 In the third page of charts, the top panel presents a view of G-3 exchange rates from  the dollar’s pers pective, depicting the value since one dollar in term s of the yen di vided by one hundred in green. The bottom  panel provides a view of exchange rates from  the yen’s perspective, depicting the value of one hundred yen in dollars, the green line, and the value of 100 yen in euros, the blue line. With the naked eye I think you can see that the yen-based pair in the bottom  panel track each other m uch mo re closely than the d ollar-bas ed pair in the top panel. Comparing th e correlation coefficients n oted in the subperiods in the top and bottom  pane ls, you can see that the only period in which the daily changes of the dol lar pair track ed m ore closely was from  January through April of 1997. From  May 1997 onward, when the unwinding of the yen carry trades began to put pressure on the Thai baht, the daily changes in the yen pair ha ve correlated much m ore closely. Now, neither of these graphs nor th e correlations is proof that the yen is the p rincipal dr iver of  the G-3 exc hange rates. But I do think the data powerfully suggest that the differenc es between North Am erica on the one hand and Europe on the other are much less s ignificant than the differences, as expres sed in excha nge rates, between Japan on the one hand and North Am erica and Europe on the other. If euro/yen and dollar/yen are m oving to the beat of one drum, there is only so m uch room  left for inde pendent expression in the euro/dollar exchange rate. Again, I certainly be lieve that differences in growth prospects between the U nited States  and the euro-11 influence the euro/do llar exchange ra te. But I al so think th at the weak Japanese econom y and the crippled Japanese f inancial system  have had an oscillating influence on portfolio allo cations that in turn have had a significan t impact on th e major exchange  rates--an im pact that has been ignored by those who do not take the tim e to consider all th ree sides of the triangle. Turning to the fourth page of char ts, the top panel depicts euro/yen and dollar/yen exchange rates as they have traded since the start of the year. The bottom  panel shows the implied volatilities of one-m onth options on all three of the major currency pairs since the start of the year. Now, the third perc eptio n I m entioned at the outset was that the Japanese authorities can be relied upon to stabilize the yen w ith verbal and official intervention. The germ  of tr uth in that perception is that the Japanese authorities have stabilized th e yen so f ar this y ear, a t least to some appearances. The problem  is that the m arket’s app arent reliance on the authorities’ ability to do so is li kely to be m isplaced. On January 12, 6/29-30/99 4 indicated by the vertical  line on the lef t in the top  panel, th e Japanese authorities purchased And the shaded area on the right indicates the of dolla r intervention and the of euro intervention the Japanese aut horities conducted in m id-June. While there was a m odest uptick in the implied volatili ties, as shown in the bo ttom panel, what surp rises me is how little and how short- lived that reaction was. Indeed, dollar/yen and euro/y en implied volatilities ar e back to th eir lows of the year. Anecd otal ev idence from  the m arket suggests strongly that many who have exposures are sim ply leaving them unhedged and that others are eager to write options and collect prem iums, leaving them selves unhedged, all in th e expectation that the Japanese author ities will keep th e yen conta ined. It is po ssible tha t the yen will stabiliz e; I d on’t want to rule that ou t entirely. But I th ink it is  more like ly that the re liance on tha t expecta tion will sim ply delay th e position adjustm ents--or worse, w ill encourag e an entirely  new round of yen carry trades. The fifth page of charts addresse s the last perception I m entioned-­that the levels of interest rates and of econom ic activity in the United States will b e dete rmined princ ipally by the words and deeds of the members of this Comm ittee. I should, of course, point out th at the re is an elem ent of truth behind that perception also, par ticula rly with  respec t to the pred ictable im pact of the Comm ittee’s deeds on short-term rates. Within the last few weeks, in the absence of what we m ight norm ally think of as noteworthy data, it seem s to m e that bond yields have been pushed higher by a m edley of unattributed voices. The top panel depicts several stages of the bond m arket’s move ments since your last m eeting. First, I think  it is wor th noting th at in the days f ollowing the Comm ittee’s announcem ent on May 18 the bond m arket rallied. The long bond rallied every day that week; along the rest of  the yield curve other bonds backed up on the day after the announcem ent but ra llied for the rest of the week. Now, in defense of the m arket, I don’t think its initial reaction was unreasonable. After all, the 10-year  Treasury had already backed up 50 basis points in yield from early Apri l. I think the m arket took som e pleasure in s eeing th at the central ban k was preparing to react to the perceived risk of inflation but did not plan to do so abruptly or in a knee-jerk f ashion.  I think it is also wort h noting that many m arket participants interpreted the FOMC’s announcem ent as implying a heightened risk of a 25 basis point increase in rates. However, beginning on May 27, the m arket began receiving a series of reports about the views of the Committee, including com ments by FOMC m embers and other Fed officials suggesting that a m ore aggressive tightening should be expected. This threat, giving the m arket a new sense 6/29-30/99 5 of risk, trigg ered a backu p in yields  and anxious reactions to s everal not particularly significan t data releases. On June 1 the long bond backed up 11 basis points after the NAPM prices paid index cam e in at 55.2 rather  than closer to the expected 53.3. On June 4 the bond m arket backed up only 3 basis points in reaction to the release of the data on em ploym ent and average hourly wages; but then on in retail sales versus expectations of  0.7 or 0.8 percent. Subsequently, the release of the flat CPI on June 16 and the Chairm an’s June 17 testim ony before the J oint Econo mic Commit tee calm ed the m arket with a perception that a m oderate tightening wa s in store. But as you can see on the cha rt, the “re lief rally” was short-liv ed. By early last wee k, the m arket was once again on the receiving end of  a chorus of voices threatening more aggressive actions. In my judgm ent, if you had tried to trade in the bond market during this period and had followed only the FOMC’s announcem ent on May 18, the data releases as they cam e out, and the Chairm an’s Joint Econom ic Comm ittee testim ony, you would have lost  a lot of m oney. On the other hand, if you had subscribed to all the high-priced insider rags and carefully tracked the u tterances, attr ibuted and unattributed, of FOMC members, you would have fared a good bit better. Looking at the bottom  two panels on this page, you can see that credit spreads and volatilities did back up a little, bu t not very m uch--less than I would have expected, given all the fi ts and starts in the bond m arket. I think it is particularly noteworthy th at the im plied volatility on  the S&P futures contract was actu ally lower on the period. In sum , there seem s to be a very odd  mix of anxiety and com placency in this m arket, which I don’t pretend to understand fully nor do I yet see how it will work itse lf out. Finally, turning to dom estic open m arket operations, the chart on page 6 depicts the volatility of the fed funds rate. We had significantly less volatility and a m uch be tter contained funds m arket during this period than we had earlier in the year. The red dots cover the interm eeting period and the blue dots cover the period from  January 14 through May 18. As you can see, the m edian value of the eff ective d eviation from the targe t in absolute term s was only 5 basis point s and the standard deviation was down to 8 basis points during the recent  interm eeting period. So we have had a m uch calm er funds m arket and f unds have traded a bit on the soft side. 6/29-30/99 6 The rather extraordinary conditions in the current m aintenance period have posed som ething of a challenge for the Desk. The m arket had a very low appetite for reserves com ing into  this period, expect ing to hold large quantities of  excess reserves at the quarter-end. And even as we left reserves quite short, the m arket traded  on the soft side. Last Thursday, as the m arket began to tu rn its a ttention to the sho rtage for this w eek, we arrang ed a 3 -day forward RP for settlem ent Monday to in ject about $7 billion to cover these last days. But given the com bination of ev ents tom orrow--a quarter-en d, a maintenance period end, and a very high expectation that the Comm ittee will raise rates--it has b een rath er hard to get the funds rate  to trade v ery far below 5 percent, even th ough I think  we have finally su cceed ed in that effort today. I will be candid, however; I ha ve som e fears that our efforts to do this over a Monday and  Tuesday will l ead to a f ed funds rate of zero by tomorrow night, notwithstanding your a nnouncem ent, whatever it m ay be. I should m ention that over the first six m onths of the year the SOMA portfolio has expanded by alm ost $30 b illion, which is a record expansion of our outright holdings. This has been  in response principally to currency in circulation, but we have been a dding to the portfolio all along the maturity spe ctrum . Even with the s lightly stronger currency growth, we still think that the norm al $12 billion leeway will be adequate for the coming interm eeting period. Mr. Chairm an, we had no foreign exchange operations during the period bu t I will need th e Comm ittee’s ra tification of  our dom estic operations. And I would be happy to answer any questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions for Peter? 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Just a quick question on your chart discussion, Peter: On the third page where you were talking about the cross rates, I am  wondering as I read the portion of the bottom  panel covering 1999 whether things m ay be changing. It looks as if the correlation between dollar/ye n and euro/yen is dim inishing in relation to what it was in earlier periods. Maybe the opposite is happening in the to p panel. Am I looking at that right? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Our perception is very m uch that the daily changes are still being driven by the yen. The anxiet y of the Japanese authoritie s is now as m uch focused on euro/yen as dolla r/yen, a nd they in tervened in euro/yen for the first tim e ever during this period. I agree with you but I think som e other things are going on here; I don’t m ean to suggest that this encom passes a ll of the inputs that determ ine ex change rates. Still, during 6/29-30/99 7 these six m onths and even in recent weeks, the daily changes up and down in euro/yen and dollar/yen seem  to be moving toge ther. Although I did not refer to this in m y rem arks, we hear anecdotally that there is a sense am ong market participants, both in Europe and in Japan, that a lot of the pressure on the yen re flects Japanese invest ors who had established position s in Europe and are com ing back into yen now that they are deep ly under water. What you can’t tell from  this pan el, because it is  not expressed in term s of exchange rates, is that at the end of Septembe r of last year, the end of Japan’s fiscal  half-year, euro/yen was at 160. Now it is at 124 or so. So, a nyone from  Japan who took on a position in euro assets at that earlier po int is deep ly un der wate r. It is actually a widespread perception in Tokyo that the Ministry of Finance’s incentive to  intervene w as to try to help institutional investo rs get out of those position s without st rengthening the y en. So, other things are certainly going on. The sense of the str ong U.S. econom y vis-à-vis Europe is also certainly apropos. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Peter, I have a question for you or Karen about the huge Japanese support of the yen. Has this intervention been  sterilized com pletely or partially?  The numbers are so large that they would have gr eat significance for their m onetary base, and I just wondered what the policy is. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. The norm al course that I believe the Bank of Japan is following is that they sterilize this interv ention. It is a very complicated  arrangem ent. It’s as if the Exchange Stabilization F und, the equ ivalen t acco unting en tity, could actually is sue its own bills to the m arket to f inance its elf. That’s in ef fect what the Bank o f Japan does on behalf of the Ministry. So in the first step, the Bank of Japan gives the Ministry yen liquidity. But the Ministry then has to fi nance that by borrow ing yen in the m arkets and issuing securities directly to repay the Bank of Japan; it would be the accounting equivalent o f the Exchange Stabilization Fund iss uing its own  bills d irectly. So it is sterilized. I think that question is diffe rent from  the questi on of the extent of accomm odation in th e Bank of Japan’s m onetary stance. It is stil l a very accommodative stance. They have m anaged to keep their ove rnight rate trading at  2 or 3 basis points, which is the brokers’ spread. So that rate has been effectiv ely zero throughout the period. 6/29-30/99 8 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON. I think that “zero” is the m agic word. Whatever intervention the Bank of Japan chooses to do, whether it is in  dom estic assets or in foreign exchange-­and the latter is what they have been doi ng--they no longer have room  on the downside at the very short-term  end of the m oney market to  lower inte rest rates any f urther. So in that s ense th ere is no such thing as u nsteril ized interven tion because  there is no place to go. There are lots of people out there arguing about whether or not allowing the monetary base to continue to expand under those circum stances has expansionary influences, and through what channels. We are obviously looking for the latter in Japan. But in the m ost ordinary sense of sterilized and unsterilized interv ention, both in terms of what happened on the balance sheet and whether it did or did not aff ect short-term  money 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. That is rather  interesting because, of c ourse, we often think about sterilization not necess arily in term s of the im pact on rates bu t on the m onetary b ase. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON. At this point, the change in the Japanese m onetary base doesn’t seem  to be having any particular im plicati ons. At least changes of this order of magnitude can’t be perceived as being follo wed by changes, for exam ple, in better lending conditions and increased  bank credit creation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. I think it is  instructive that th e Japanes e are creating what essentially are very useful e xperim ents in intervention, whether we call it sterilized or otherwise. As you m ay recall, they sold in U.S. dollars and bought yen a while back with very m odest, if any, effects. They have done the reverse this tim e, except they have added another or so in euro, with little effect. Many econom ists would argue theoretically that ster ilized intervention ca nnot affect exchange rates m aterially. What the Japanese have su cceeded in doing is pr oving that proposition. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Peter, co nsidering tha t the ea rlier v ersion of the yen carry trade contribu ted so dangerously to the Thai  baht explosion in July 1997, are you and your colleagues at other central banks able to track reasonably well the buildup of that so we can take any supervisory action that is appropriate? 6/29-30/99 9 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. At the aggreg ate level, it is quite hard; the data are rather poor. At the firm  level, I presum e one can find out what decisions individua l firm s have m ade. Tracking this involves relyi ng on anecdotal inform ation. There was an attem pt to tabulate som e data for Japan, which was not  very satisfactory. The results were published by som e outfi t here in W ashington wh ose nam e I don’t recall, but the data were pretty poor once you scratched the surface. When I check ed with the Bank of Japan, they told us to be very suspicious of those data . So unfortunately, the answer is no, we cannot track that at an aggregate leve l. But it is som ething we are alw ays talking about with others in the m arket and we get som e anecdotal in formation. I don’t know how accurate that is. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH . So som e supervis ory sniffing around m ight be appropriate? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, it is  certainly ea sier to try to get a handle on it at the firm level. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Peter, I think you have gotte n a little too subtle for m e and I am not sure I’m following you. Why did you choose to  focus on this issue of whether it is a yen thing or a dollar phenom enon?  What significance do you think that has for the Comm ittee? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I am worried a bout the risk that people pe rceive it as a dollar thing when in fact I think it is a yen thing. I think sloppy polic ies, sloppy policy reactions, and uninform ed market behavior can result if people think they are responding to one stimulus when that stim ulus rea lly is n’t th e dom inant one. So my first in stinc t is to m ake sure m y thinking is as clear as I can m ake it regarding what m ay be influencing exchange rates. That is really th e major thrust of my message, nothing more than that. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Did Japan ever intervene with marks? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. No, they did not. They hold a few m arks but I don’t believe they ever form ally intervened  in m arks. 

[SECTION]

MR.MCTEER. So this could be the beginning of the euro as an intervention curren cy? This is the f irst time it wa s ever used that way ? 6/29-30/99 10 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. It was th e first tim e it wa s used by the Japanese. I think it reflected a certain flam boyance on the part of  the Ministry of Finance, trying to grab attention for itself in Tokyo. But also, to be fair, a lot of the pressures were em anating from  the m ovement in euro/yen. So to the extent they wanted to  respond, they realized that if  they o nly interven ed in dollar /yen, it would be a release valve and would be hard to get their hands on the problem . So there wa s a tactical reason, but I think flam boyance might also have been a reason. I was very surprised to see the ECB begi n a relationship by intervening as agent on behalf of the Japan ese au thorities because the Bundesba nk had always resisted do ing that. I should be clear that this norm al courtesy m ay increasingly becom e something of an artifact sin ce most of the foreign exchange m arket trades through a s ingle com puter, or at leas t the price setting takes p lace in the electron ic brokering system  (EBS) term inal. So liquid ity is not a geographi c phenom enon; it is a temporal phenom enon of when people are conne cted to and are watching the EBS. So we m ay get away from  this notion of geogr aphic intervention, but that hasn’t quite happened yet. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I believ e your fourth point was that peop le seem  to be reacting to rhetor ic more than to the  statistics. What was the significance of bringing that to our atten tion? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I think the bond m arket has been focused on the words of members of this Comm ittee, both for attribution and not, to an extent that I have not seen in my adm ittedly not very long tenu re in th is position. I find that dis turbing in term s of the influence on policy. It looks to m e as if this bond m arket has priced in a 25 basis point m ove about four tim es. I can’t  prove that and I don’t know that. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Cum ulatively? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. They have taken that 25 basis point increase in and out. I am not suggesting that that has any profound m acroeco nomic effect. But the in and out pricing repetitions have been in response to the rhet oric, not the econom ic data. That was my point. 6/29-30/99 11 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Do you think the announcem ent of the bias in the directive is part of this? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Clearly som ething very di fferent happened after the last m eeting with the ann ouncem ent of a bias. I said at th e end of m y remarks that th ere is a strang e mix of what m arket players are anxious about  and what they are com placent about. I looked for a way to express to th e Comm ittee what I thought they were anxious abou t and what I thoug ht they were com placent about. I thin k their focus is m isplaced but, to be candid, I can’t quite put m y finger on it. They seem  to have som e expectation that w ords from this Committee, whether indiv idually o r collectively, will som ehow r emove all the uncertainties. That is rather naïve and m yopic. But they hang on every word as if it were going to so lve the uncertain ties for them . I just  don’t th ink it will. Indeed, it hasn ’t, as you can see by how the bond m arket has behave d. So if I was not clear enough, I hope that he lps. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Some of the initial co mmentary I saw after the announcem ent by the Japanese in early June of their first-qua rter number was along the lines that it was a statistical fluke or window-dre ssing. The view was that it w asn’t real and that by year-end we would see the Japanese economy back in the tank again. A fair amount of the commentary had the ton e of: “This is som ething we did not forecas t so it couldn’t possibly be true.” More recen tly, I h ave seen  more comm entaries suggesting th at the first quarter m ay have represented a turnin g point, though the GDP num ber m ay be exaggerated, and that from this point forwar d Japan would be viewed as having seen the worst. Is there any dom inance of one opinion or the other in the street? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I certainly defer to Karen for a view on the real m erits of what you’ve suggested. In term s of the view on the Street, I thi nk most non-Japanese observers are still h ighly skeptical. They are not  yet in the ca mp that thin ks this is f or real, although they are intr igued and are wondering where the opportunities m ay be. After all, the Nikkei turned up. So there is a little bait-on-th e-hook dangling there for them . I think the Japanese are quite anxious  and wondering if it is tim e to bring their money home. The quantities do not m atter, but the price should. So in T okyo there is a lot of anxiety about that. There also is a lot of anxiety about wh at the im pact on Japan 6/29-30/99 12 might be of any action by this Comm ittee. It doesn’t m ake any sense to m e, but they think th at if this Comm ittee r aises rates, it wi ll strengthen the yen. And that ac tually is  an issue within Japan as well. So I think the anxieties about this be ing a turning point are somewhat geographically separated, if I can put it that way. But if Karen wants to add anything on the specifics-­

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I will defer m y comment s on that until after the Chart S how, since we are going to go into som e of those issues as we return to honest-to-goodness real econom ics! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Any further qu estions for Peter?  If not, would somebody like to m ove to ratify the transactions? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Move approval of the dom estic open 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objec tion. Let’s m ove on to the Chart Show. Mike Prell. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I don’t know how real the ec onom ics are, but there are tangible charts to which we will be ref erring. 2/ I thought I’d begin with a brief update on the second quarter, taking into account a few data we’ve received since the Greenbook was completed. As usual at this point, w e’re still attempting to blend the labor m arket data with the expenditure figures to get a fix on current-quarter GDP. The relationship is loose, but the weaker  growth of production worker hours in should look for a m oderation of real  output grow th this quarter. Considering  the spend ing num bers as well, our best guess for the real GDP increas e is still abo ut 3 perc ent. Yesterday’s report on consum er spending for May contained no major surprises. Antic ipating a m oderate increas e in June, w e see real PCE this quarter running som ething over 4 percent--off m arkedly from  the 6¾ percen t first-quarter pace. Housing starts, at the m iddle left, fe ll off considerably on av erage in materials, rather than any shortage of de mand. Owing to the lags between 2/ A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Prell and Ms. Johnson is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 2) 6/29-30/99 13 starts and construction outlays, real re siden tial investm ent probably will be up, but only modestly, this quarter. As plotted at the right, last week’s  advance report fr om manufacturers showed that shipm ents of non-defens e capital goods, excluding aircraft, were strong through May. This rein forces our view that th ere will be a hefty increase in PDE this quarter , although various anecdotes and the NAPM survey would suggest that som e of the rise in shipm ents of capital goods m ight show up in export sales. In that regard, the pane l at the lower lef t shows th at over all exports firmed in April. Even s o, the trade gap still was  som ewhat larger than th e first-quarter average, as we continued to exhibit an enorm ous appetite for imports. Turning to the right panel, it woul d appear that f ew of those im ports ended up in business inventories in April. The book value of manufacturing and trade st ocks, ex motor vehicles, rose only m odestly-­roughly m atching the first-quarter rate of accumulation. All told, then, the picture is one of  a step-down in GDP growth this quarter. But final dem and can scarcely  be said to have turned weak--and invento ries probably are lean enough  that desires to build s tocks will spu r production in com ing months. With that pr elude, let me turn to the summary of the staff forecast, contained in Chart 2. As has been  the case for a long tim e now, we are projecting a considerable moderation in  the trend of real GDP growth. The quarterly num bers represented by  the bars in the upper left panel gyrate later this year and in early 200 0 because of  our allowance for som e Y2K eff ects, but the gen eral drift is toward a slightly sub-par growth trend. Being just slightly sub-par, though, that growth probably would be sufficient to hold the une mploym ent rate in  the low 4s through next year. Largely, bu t not solely, because of the continu ed tightn ess of the labor m arket, we’re expecti ng that the rate of infla tion will trend higher, as generates an  acceleration  of the overall CPI to a 2 ¼ percen t increas e this year; a leveling of oil pri ces holds total CPI inflat ion at the sam e average pace in 2000  even as th e core com pone nt accelerates. The acceleration in overall GDP prices is sm oother, becaus e the d irect oil p rice effects on this index are smaller. As we e mphasized in the Gree nbook, the stock market outlook--the subject of the next chart--is quite cen tral to our fo recas t. With the “drag” from  the external sector likely to be  diminishing, the projected m oderation 6/29-30/99 14 of GDP growth hinges on a substantial slackening in the growth of domestic dem and. The half percenta ge point funds rate increase we’ve assum ed to occur in the next several months and the sustained higher level of interm ediate- and lon g-term  inter est rates sho uld work in that d irection. However, a cessation of the uptrend in share prices is an im portant ingredient as well, and whether that is  indeed at hand is open to question. The top left panel updates the pr ovocative com parison of the 1920s and 1990s bull m arkets that I included in  the last chart show. We’re still pretty m uch on track, with som e upsi de ahead of us. Certainly, the fact that the m arket has g iven up so little ground in the recen t period of interest rate run-up is testam ent to the abiding exuberance of investors. That point is given further em phasi s by the right panel, which shows the current extraord inary  narrowness of the equity prem ium, as proxied by the gap between the earnings yield on the S&P 500, based on analysts’ profit expectations for the com ing tw elve m onths, and the real 10-year Treasury rate. The m iddle panels p lotting price -earnings m ultiples a lone ar e perhaps less in sightful analy tically--bu t may still be of  some interest. The lef t panel in p articula r illus trates that the run-up in PE s has been unusual in that it has occurred at a tim e so dist ant from  a cyclical trough in profits. Together, as we’ve suggested repe atedly--and evidently wrongly-­these indicators would seem  to suggest  that the m arket could be vulnerable to a quite sizable decline, if and as rosy corporate profit expectations are disappointed. Nonetheless, we’ve pr ojected only a flattening in share prices. That still produces the de cline in the household wealth-incom e ratio charted in the lower left panel,  however, which should help take the steam  out of consum er dem and. The little tab le at the r ight is in tende d to highlight the relative potency of stock m arket effects today. Beca use of the huge run-up in the wealth-incom e ratio since the end of 1994, a given percentage change in share prices translates into a much greater consum ption effect than before. As indicated, w hen we apply our standa rd rule of thum b to a 10 percent is now 0.4 percent, twice what it was earlier. In the Greenbook, we simulated a rapid 25 percent decline in the activity. Looking at the pa nels above, one m ight be able to envision a much deeper bear m arket. But, even with the simulation we perform ed, it might be asked whether there could not be greater effects on dem and than predicted because of financial im balances that our m odel cannot capture. 6/29-30/99 15 This is no simple m atter to pin down, but Chart 4 provides a f ew clues. First, the upper panel tends  to allay one co ncern. Although the volum e of margin debt outstanding has skyrocketed, when scaled by the value of equ ities, as it is he re, it does n’t look so s tartling. However, this is a very narrow m easure of leveraging and consequent risk exposure. The right panel show s two aggregate ratios of households’ indebtedness to their holdings of liqui d assets. The black line reveals that debt has been rising considerably rela tive to holdings of the most liquid of financial assets--deposits, money fu nds, and governm ents. But the red line indicates that d ebt has been fa lling relative to a broader range of assets that com prises as well corp orate and m unicipal securities and mutual funds. So, there’s not m uch sign here that even though debt has been growing appreciably faster than incom e, household balance sheets in the aggr egate have beco me more illiquid. Is there something lurking out ther e at a disaggregated level that might imply a different assessm ent?  We’ve generated som e prelim inary tabulations f rom the 1998 Survey of Consum er Finances to address that issue, and th ese are laid out in th e middle panels. I’d note on the left panel that there’s been a considerable shif t in the distribution of household debt from  those without stock (a sm aller portion of the population today) to those who have significant am ounts of stock--defined in the second colum n as a holding equal to at least one-half year’s incom e. But, if shareholders have taken on a larger am ount of debt, they’ve not incurred extraordinary debt-servi ce burdens. As indicated in the second column of the right panel, th e median monthly paym ent burden as a percen t of incom e for significan t sharehold ers has increased,  but it is somewhere between the ratios fo r households with sm aller or no shareholdings. I should add the caveat  that the incom e conc ept in these ratios often includes realized capit al gains, which m ight suggest the possibility of som e greater exposur e for the shareholding households, but another fact is that the significant sh areholders also have relatively large amounts of other assets. Thus, even if one were to assum e a very deep drop in the stock m arket, it would not  generally have drastic effects on their ability to c over their debts. The bottom  panels focus on a nother conceivable point of vulnerability, the banking system . As you can see at the left, the black line indica tes that alm ost all bank ing a ssets are h eld by institu tions tha t are well cap italized. The co mfort one might draw from  that fact today is perhaps a little less than would have been the case a couple of years ago, however, because--as shown by the re d line--the m argin by which the banks exceed their regulatory capital requirem ents has shrunk a bit. 6/29-30/99 16 If one were to think about how th e banking system m ight be affected by a stock m arket plunge, at least one can rule out the m ore direct links that proved devastating in Japan when their bubble burst. Having consulted with our supervisory folks, it appears that the g reatest concern might be that loans have been m ade to firm s that have engaged in aggress ively priced acqu isitions, with the expecta tion that th ose loans will be repaid ou t of proceed s of subse quent sto ck or junk bond issues. The yield sp read at the righ t; but with def aults alread y rising the spreads have remained appreciable. A broad retren chment in stock prices m ight cause an edgy junk m arket to turn very sour and leave banks with either losses or impaired ass ets that would in turn m ake them  more cautious lenders. My sense though, is that--short of a severe  market setback--we are not talking about financial dislocations of such a scope and intensity that we need to The kinds of pressures financial markets will face obviously will depend considerably on the am ount of inflation that lies ahead. Chart 5 summarizes the labo r market forces impinging on wages. Our forecast of labor dem and is prem ised on what is , relative to p revailing p rofessional norm s, a pretty optim istic assessm ent of the dim ension of recent and prospective structural gains in labor  productivity. As you can see in the top panel, h owever, we’re expecting  that g rowth in output p er hour will slow in the near term , not becaus e the struc tural im provem ents will ebb, but becaus e we expect th at hiring wo n’t be geared down i mmediately and commensurately as production decelerates. In any event, we don’t foresee m uch relief from  the labor m arket tightness. The labor force participation rate, plotted in the m iddle left panel, has been fluctuating in an esse ntially sideways direction for a while, after having risen a bit as  people perhaps were drawn into the workforce partly by the perception that jobs were readily available. As indicated at the right, the percentage of responde nts to the Conference Board survey who say that jobs are easy to get se ems to be leveling out, and we’re expecting labor force participation to rem ain in the recen t range. In this tigh t labor m arket, workers have achieved som e leverage in the wage-setting process, and we’re fore casting that com pensation incre ases, plotted at th e lower lef t, will be tending to grow. We believe that we were probably correct in expecti ng th at the low rate of  price inf lation in the pa st year or two would be moderating nom inal wage incre ases, b ut the f irst-quarter fall-off in the ECI m easure of com pensation looks too low to believe. In fact, doing som e rethi nking, partly in light of other inform ation that has come in of late, we have m oved our ECI forecast back up noticeably this tim e, after having initially dropped it quite 6/29-30/99 17 conveyed in the forecasts of both th e ECI and the Productiv ity and Costs series for hourly com pensation, is that  tight labor m arkets--with a helping hand from  Uncle Sam  on the m inimum wage front--are likely to produce ongoing large real pay increases. The right panel docum ents the re al compensation  gains in the forecast, responding in p art to questions that h ave arisen at p ast meetings. I’ve based this on the Productiv ity and Costs series in p art because it relates m ore direc tly to the m ovem ents in in come shares in the NIPAs. The point that is highlighted here is that, though the projected real pay gains m ay look rather skimpy relative to productivity trends w hen they are measured against consu mer prices, when they’re m easured agains t prod uct prices they are quite sizable. Workers have been capturing a bigger share of the pie. This spells a squeeze on profit m argins--unless b usinesses can find some leverage of their own on the pricing side. We don’t think that they will do so, b ut there are som e risks. As you can see in the to p panel of th e next chart, we have core consum er prices accelerating over the next y ear and a half. This reflects in part the labor cost pressures I’ve just described. In addition, there will be som e pass- through into core prices of the rebound in oil prices via higher trans portation costs and other channels. The m iddle left panel highlights a nother unfavorable factor--nam ely, the tu rn tha t is lik ely to o ccur in non -oil im port pr ices as the d ollar peaks and foreign econom ies m anage to generate m ore dom estic dem and for their output. One can already observe  that im port price trends have becom e somewhat less f avorable than they were earlier, with a rise in materials prices being a s ignifican t elem ent in that pattern. Looking for signs of whether the ti de m ight be turning in domestic prices, one indicator that people som etimes consult as a m easure of so-called “pipe line” inf lation is the PPI core in termediate com ponent, graphed at the right. These prices d on’t bulk large in term s of their weight in overall production costs, but they ca n be an early indicator of broader inflationary pressures. They’ve prob ably now posted their first quarterly increase since 1997. Some of this is m etals prices, which rallied in part on Asian growth prospects; som e of it is the effect of higher petroleum feedstock costs; and some of it is  the pressures on  capacity in the construction m aterials industry. These don’t quite sm ell like a broad-based inflationary surge, though. Moreover, the below-average overall factory utilization rate in our foreca st, shown at the lower left, suggests that, althoug h com petitiv e pressu res from  abroad m ay ease a bit, a m ajor flare-up in goods price inflation is not in the imm ediate offi ng. 6/29-30/99 18 There have been som e comm ents in Reserve Bank reports that consum ers have becom e som ewhat less price conscious. This m ight suggest som e shift in inflation expe ctations. The final panel shows the Michigan SRC m edian readings on 1 y ear and 5-to-10 year expectations. On the m oving average basis plotted he re to filter out som e of the noise, both series are off their lows, but wh ether the downtrends of the past several years are in process of reve rsing is not clear. A sanguine--and quite plausible--interpretat ion would be that expect ations were dam ped to an extra deg ree last year by the plung e in energy prices and that we have seen a one-tim e adjust ment back up in light of th e recen t rebound in those prices. The pattern here is  not dissim ilar to tho se in the ch arts of the price serie s them selves : In ne ither case is  the direction unam biguous and as a result they perhaps serve best as a sort of Rorschach test for one’s degree of inflation phobia. Karen will n ow discuss the inte rnatio nal pic ture.

MS. JOHNS ON. The ge neral tone of developm ents abroad since the the spre ad of the global f inancial crisis  to Latin Am erica have not been as dire as we feared in February; signs of  recovery in Asia have added to the sense that the crisis, as such, is at or near its end. Nevertheless, there is no lack of risks em bedded in the current foreign outlook. A major elem ent of the more sanguine outlook f or the rest of  the world is the perception that various  financial m arket ind icators are signaling progress in the real economy. Chart 7 shows selected real exchange rates and stock m arket indexes. The top pair refer to the m ajor industrial countries. The black line on the left panel shows that on balance during 1999 the dollar has risen in real terms relativ e to an ave rage of  the m ajor foreign c urrenc ies. In large p art, that rise reflects the strengthening of the dollar re lative to the euro (th e blue line). The dollar has also rise n on balance in real term s agains t the Japanese yen during 1999, but it re mains f ar below the value it had reached in the m iddle of last y ear. In the forecas t, we expect a gradual depreciation of the dollar in real term s against these currencies, as relative macroeconom ic conditio ns becom e less supportive of the dollar and as imbalance-- a topic to which I sha ll return at the end of m y rem arks. Stock prices for these countries, on the right, are am ong the fi nancial indicators signaling optim ism during the past several m onths. Although they declined sharply last August and Septem ber during the turm oil following the Russian debt m oratorium, they have increased on balance so far in 1999, including the Japanese index. 6/29-30/99 19 The m iddle panels show  the sam e variables for selected Asian countries. In real term s, the dollar has reversed much of its appreciation against the Thai baht and Korean won th at occu rred as the crisis spread in 1997. Most recen tly, tho se currencies have been fairly stable in nom inal terms and inflation has been quite cont ained, developm ents that we expect will con tinue. We have incorporated into th e forecast a stab le Hong Kong dollar peg to the U.S. dollar, but so me nom inal appreciation of the dollar against the Chinese renm inbi in 2000. With U.S. inflation generally abov e that in Hong Kong, the result is slight real dollar apprec iation in both cases in our outlook. Asian stock much progress has been m ade in addr essing the structural problem s laid bare by the crisis. In recent m onths, the foreign sector of the Chinese stock m arket (the black line) has risen particularly sharply. The three m ajor Latin A merican count ries are shown at the bottom . We are projecting that the Brazilian real  will remain nea r current lev els in nominal term s. With Brazilian infla tion contained but above U.S. rates, the real should appreciate som e in real term s, i.e. dollar depreciation. Controversy over the Argentine peso  convertibility regim e abounds. Proposals for dollarization are still activ ely discussed, yet there have been issue will be resolved, at least until th e election in October, we continue to expect the peg to hold. In that event, with Argentine inflation expected to remain below U.S. rates, the dollar should rise slightly in real term s agains t the Argentine p eso. The sto ck markets in Brazil and Mexico have shared in the optim ism being expresse d elsewhere. In Argentina, ongoing Your next chart presents our outl ook for foreign growth, with som e details on the industrial c ountries. As is evident in the top left, we anticipate a convergence of U.S. real GDP  growth with the average of that abroad in 2000. Our view that real output growth abroad should pick up this year is bolstered by the surprisi ngly robust first-quarter results that have been reported for som e countries , including Japan. We see som e of that strength as transi tory, however, and so look for som e offset in the current quarter and, in general, have not extrapolated even stronger growth perform ance into next year. As can be  seen at the right, the lion’s share of the im provem ent is expected to occu r in developing Asia, with som ewhat less acceleration in Latin America. Industrial country growth is projected to firm . In the m iddle left panel, the latest  data on industrial production reflect the som ewhat lacklus ter perform ance in Europe in recen t quarters in 6/29-30/99 20 contrast to the vigor in  Canada. The latest da ta for Japan show som e improve ment, but not enough to e xplain the 7.9 percent annual GDP growth in the first quarter that was recently announced. Our projection f or sustained expansion in these countries rests in part on the accommodative monetary conditions that are visible in the m iddle right panel. Some improve ment in business confidence, s een in the lower lef t panel, is another factor leading us in that dire ction. The Japanese Tankan report for the second quarter is due to be releas ed shortly. A significant m ove in the positiv e dire ction is wide ly expec ted, es pecially in  light of  the f act the survey was taken shortly after the str ong Q1 real GDP data were released. The top panels on Chart 9 docum ent th e recovery that is unfolding in the Asian crisis countries. Indus trial production has been rebounding since the m iddle of last year, with production in Korea m oving above its pre-crisis peak. Dollar interest rate spreads have moved back down, though not to the levels of early 1997. This narrowing reflects im proved spreads before the crisis were too low. The recovery in the developing Asian countries rem ains vulnerable, and a m ajor disruption elsewhere could renew pressures on them . Although we are exp ecting that Chin a will exp erience sustain ed moderate growth and financial stability, deve lopm ents in that country are one possible source of renew ed volatility in Asia. The m iddle left panel highligh ts some external issues. The Chinese trade surplu s (in black ) has been shrinking since m id-1998. At first, a sharp drop-off in exports narrowed th e trad e balan ce; in recen t months, exports have recovered somewhat but im ports have surged. The higher rate of recorded im ports red line shows foreign direct investm ent in China. While there se em to be seasonally low inflows in the first quarte r, the d ata for this year are below those for the first quarter in both 199 7 and 1998. Foreign direct investm ent has tended to go into the export sector  and to support investm ent in the non-state sector. The real depreciati on of other Asian currencies has put pressure on the Chinese export sector  and m ay weaken inward direct investm ent. The right panel illustrate s the deflation that China has been experiencing, another sym ptom  of the depressed dem and within China. Industrial production bounced back in th e second half of last year from some slowing earlier. The m ost recent m onths’ data suggest that production continues to expand m oderately; as a consequence,  our forecast is for som ewhat slower growth in Chin a than h as been the case in the past, but we are not looking f or a deflationa ry spiral to becom e established. The lower left panel suggests som e risks for the developing Asian econom ies. The em ergence of recovery and the return of financial m arket confidence could underm ine the m omentum  behind the reform  process. In 6/29-30/99 21 Korea and other countries, where difficu lt issues of indus trial relations and corporate go vernance n eed to be ad dressed, m oderate growth m ay lessen the sense of  urgency and  the political will f or ref orm. In many of  these countries, banking sector problem s continue and non-performing loans are still a large s hare of  total bank loan s. Moreover, the corporate sector needs resolution of these debts so th at private investm ent can resum e efficiently. In addition, weakness in the Chinese econom y might spark politica l turmoil ther e and could der ail recove ry in Asia in g eneral. The Latin A merican countries are featured on C hart 10. As you can see in the upper left, production in  Mexico has largely withstood the spread of  financia l vola tility to Latin Am erica. In Brazil and e specia lly Argentina that is not the case; produc tion has been significantly reduced. For all three countries, the stripped spreads on dollar-denom inated Brady bonds have moved back down following the previous spikes. The m ost recen t segment of all three of those li nes shows the backup in  spreads that has occurred in response to uncer tainties in Argentina about the governm ent’s fiscal program  and the comm itment to the peg of the currency to the U.S. dollar. Market  nervousness was heightened by the announcem ent in May of  your m ove to a tightening bias and the possible implications of a slower U.S. econom y and higher dollar interest rates for Latin Am erica. The m iddle lef t panel illu strates th at improvem ent in the ex ternal balances of these countries has been limited despite currency adjustm ent in Brazil and Mexico and slower  dom estic dem and. Continued dependence on capital inflows i mplies that these countries rem ain vulnerable to events that m ight disrupt global financial m arkets. Still, on balance, events in these countries have  been m ore favorable than we were expecting in February. One bit of evidence is th at Brazilian dom estic interest rates have com e down, without  negative repercussions, as shown in the m iddle right panel. Lower dom estic rates are c ritical in keeping th e domestic debt in Brazil f rom swelling at an alarm ing rate. The surprisingly moderate response of infl ation to the currency decline, shown by the red line, has been an im porta nt factor behind the decline in domestic in terest ra tes. The imm ediacy with which m arket spreads reacted to disappointing news in Argentina suggests that the situation in L atin Am erica rem ains fragile. If key financial variables shift abruptly, th e forecast o f moderate growth on average in the region could be  derailed. The m ajor risks appear to be those listed in the lower left panel. Some of the fiscal steps taken to date by Brazil were one-tim e measur es. Evidence of significan t forward progress on a perm anent basis is lack ing. If markets sense continued fiscal problem s in Brazil, they will be  quick to m ove rates, which in turn will exa cerbate the fiscal problem s. In Argentina,  both dom estic and 6/29-30/99 22 foreign inve stors a re essential to th e maintenance of the currency peg and to the financing of Argentina’s extern al deficit. Despite som e insurance that the governm ent has taken out against financial contingencies, Argentina rem ains vulnerable to a loss of  confidence. Elections this year in Argentina  and next ye ar in Mex ico add to the m arkets’ sen sitivity to any indications of policy m issteps by those governm ents. My final tw o charts focus on U.S. trade. The top panels of Chart 11 show exports and im ports for selected trading partner regions. Exports to developing Asia stalled in 1997 and then declined; exports to Latin America followed suit a bit later. Exports to Europe and Canada have, on balance, grown in nom inal term s, but not by m uch. In contrast, U.S. imports from these regions have been  a source of expanding dem and that has helped them  to sustain expans ions or m itigate declin es of production. In the oil m arket, an agreem ent in  March am ong producers to restrict supply and som e evidence to date of com pliance with that agreem ent have been successful in raising spot oil pri ces. We expect that U.S. oil im port prices will f ollow this  path, but that  both those prices will m ove back slightly as som e producers succum b to the tem ptation to inc rease outpu t at the higher prices. Non-oil comm odity prices fell sharply in 1998, in part in response to weaker global dem and. As Mike noted, we do not expect that disinflationary element to be present going f orward. The bottom  two panels explain the el ements of our forecas t for core import prices--that is the prices of goods other than oil, sem iconductors, and com puters. We look for those pr ices, the red line, to m ove from showing small declines to showing sm all increas es by the en d of the year. Next year, core im port prices should rise, but less than 2 percent for the year as a whole. This accelerat ion in im port prices owes to the disappearance of the downward effe ct of global commodity prices, shown as the bars in the left panel, and to a shift from  downward to upward pressure imparted by the com bined effect of for eign prices and the exchange rate, the bars in the right panel. The top pan els of Chart 12 decom pose the elem ents of our forecas t for the quantities of core exports ( goods excluding ag ricultural products, semiconductors, and computers) and core im ports (goods excluding oil, semiconductors, and computers). For exports, we look for foreign GDP growth to return to b eing a strong pos itive factor while the n egative im pact of past dollar appreciatio n wanes and ceases to be im portant. For im ports, stimulus both from  U.S. GDP growth a nd from  relative prices (largely the exchange rate) les sens ov er the foreca st period; accordingly, we see core import growth slowing to about 6 percent. 6/29-30/99 23 If all tho se pieces do fall into place,  real net expo rts, th e middle left panel, will continue to exert a nega tive influence on U.S. real GDP growt h but to a dim inishing extent. The nomin al trade d eficit will con tinue to widen, however. And despite a boost from  som e revisions to data for our investm ent position, and therefore som e adjustm ents to estim ates of flow incom e, the curren t acco unt deficit w ill continu e to expand, reaching som e very la rge n umbers. Relative to GDP , the curren t accoun t balance is less startling, but we anticipate that du ring the current year it will b reach the low reached in the late 1 980s. If global recovery proceeds m ore or less along the lines we have suggested in the Greenbook, so that no new crisis elem ents comm and the atten tion of m arkets, then the rap id pace at which  the U.S. external d eficit is widening and the m agnitudes that it is reachin g may receive m ore attention. We revisited our slightly more aggregated m odel that sim ulates longer-term  relationships. The continued strength  of the dollar and the relative cyclical strength of the U.S. econom y over the past two years have made the starting point of our analys is relatively unfavorable. Evidence that the pote ntial rate of growth of the United States has increased recen tly, wh ile that ab road has not, imparts an ev en greater su stain ed tendency for the U.S. external de ficit to widen over tim e than conventionally accepted. The panels at the bottom  of the chart show the current account relative to GDP, on the lef t, and the net in terna tional inve stment positio n relative to GDP, on the right. The baseline assum es that both in the United States and abroad, output returns in the near term to equal poten tial and then grows at potenti al rates thereafter. W e have also incorporated some sustained real dollar depreciation into th e baseline, 1½ percent at an annual rate. Nevertheless, the base line shows chronic widening of the curren t acco unt and dete riora tion of the net inv estment positio n. Such an outcom e implies the underlying variables are not mutually consistent and som e adjustm ent in one or more of them  would be needed. The param eters of this m odel, based on historical experience of the past two decades, suggest th at, were th e adjustm ent to com e solely through th e price com petitiveness of U.S. goods, the real depreciation of the dollar would have to average 4¼ percent per year in order for these ratios to stabilize as shown by the red line. Al ternatively, adjustm ent could com e from  income channels rather than pr ice channels. If foreign industrial output were to m ove to a higher rate  of potential growth, perhaps as a consequence of som e of the factors th at have increased productivity in the United States, and if U.S. im ports were to shift over tim e to being less responsive to U.S. incom e growth, th en the adjustm ent path shown by the blue line would resu lt. Clearly, actu al adju stment will like ly entail both channels. These results suggest to us that greater m arket attention to the 6/29-30/99 24 path for U.S. external balances is  likely although the tim ing of that atten tion is s till unce rtain. Mike will now com plete our presentation.

MR. PRELL. The final chart summ arizes your forecasts. In sh ort, th e central tendencies--constructed he re by dropping the high three and low three of the distributions  for each va riable--are closely in line with the staff’s Greenbook num bers. Y2K effects are m inimal. Perhaps m ore inte resting--and potential ly more relevant in light of the statu tory req uirem ent that the Hum phrey-Hawkin s report comm ent on the relationship of the Fed’s monetary po licy ob jectiv es to th e Adm inistration ’s forecast--is the com parison of your fo recasts to those in th e right-m ost colum n of the table, drawn from yesterday’s Mid-session Review budget docum ent. Your central tendencies are noticeab ly more optim istic about real GDP growth this year and next than  they are, but little different with respect to C PI inflation. I’m not in a position to read your m inds or those of the Adm inistration forecas ters. Howe ver, I’d note two th ings: First, it would appear that the Ad ministrati on forecasters h ave anticipated no change in short-term  rates, so m oneta ry policy does not seem  to be key to their slower growth forecast; s econd,  although th ey’ve raised their assum ption regarding trend productivity  growth, at only 1.6 percent for nonfar m businesses it lies well below the 2¼ percent im plicit in the Greenbook projection.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you very much. Questions for our colleagues ? Presiden t Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mike, I have a question a bout the Y2K effects. The quarterly impact of Y2K in the forecas t is p rimarily an in ventory effect. One gets  the im pression that there co uld be som e effect--I don ’t know  the size of it--th at could work in an opposite direction in the sense that we hear  of com panies postponing projects. Many banks, for exam ple, have delayed combining th eir data system s as they have m erged, and I imagine th ere prob ably are exam ples in other industries. The assum ption at le ast is that sometime in the year 2000, though perhaps not immediately, they are going to begin those projects--and not all of them  are IT proj ects. Is there th e potential f or a sign ificant reverse effect that we ar e not taking into account? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. We have taken account of thr ee categories of ef fects here. One is a precau tionary stockpilin g, and we have a very  modest am ount of stockpiling occurring  on the part of both households and businesses. Businesses in many cases will want to have 6/29-30/99 25 some extra supplies on hand beginning in 2000 just in case the norm al supply channels are dis rupted. The seco nd elem ent is so me disruption. There will p robably be, somewhere, som e malfunctions --electrical ou tages or whatever--that disrupt som e public servic es at the beginnin g of next year. But aga in, we m ade the assum ption that those  will be very m inor and quickly resolved. The third set of considerations re lates, I think, to the point you are raising. In our case, w e focused it entirely on the com puter area. We have assum ed that the rem arkable strength of co mputer purchases in 1998 and hefty purchases in the f irst part of this ye ar ref lect in part som e speeding up of replacem ent cycles to replace non-com pliant equipm ent. And we think there will be, at least in som e firms, a lockdown of com puter system s in the latter part  of this year, a falloff in com puter outlays, and probably a lot of scurrying around to get the last m inute fixes done. So there m ay be some subtraction from  productivity on that scor e. Next year there will probably still be some fixing up of  glitche s that are d iscovered e arly in the ye ar. But as we move throug h the year, we would anticipate a rebound in computer outlays and perhaps associated investm ents as firm s feel that they are in  the clear and can go  back to th e norm al strategies for the ir com panies. We scaled all of these things , I think, pretty sm all. The com puter swings are quite that a lot of  firms have not yet really sett led their plans on how m uch they are going to stockpile. They are still in contact w ith their suppliers, trying to get assurances th at there won’t be problem s and trying to assess where the risks m ay be. We anticip ate th at they will firm  up those decisions over the next few months and, therefore, th at most of the invento ry building will o ccur in the latte r months of this year. That is when the production effects will probably show up for the most part. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Okay. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I hav e a follow-up questi on to that. I know that the nu mbers work out right and all of that, but the thought of having a first quarter with no growth that seem s to be driven to a large ex tent by a Y2 K inventory swing just doesn’t feel right. I recognize that we are going in to a period of slowing growth around that tim e, so som e portion of the slowing reflects that. But to go from  growth  of som ething like 3.9 percent 6/29-30/99 26 in Q4 1999 to som ething close to zero in the firs t quarter of next year just doesn’t square with all the infor mation that we have been gathering about where people are with Y2K. We had a session on Y2K issues with a wide  range of industries on Friday and we invited the m edia. We had representatives from  the electrical and telephone industries, from  superm arkets, police departm ents, and banks. We had the FAA there, too. The them e was exactly the sam e in every si ngle industry: Som ewhere between 85 and 95 percen t of their sys tems are Y2K compliant, rea dy to go just as ours are. And there is a lot of near-term  focus on both contingenc y plans and outreach. We had no trouble getting the key people to com e in and tal k. We populated the audience with m edia people, including som e from  cable television. I have seen television program s about Y2K on the local cable s tations alm ost ad naus eam since then . There is a lot of desire on the part of these industries to get out the m essage that they are ready. We’ve seen some Gallup poll surveys that tell us the m ore pe ople know about the ba nking situation and so forth the less they are likely to do strange th ings or think about doing strange things at year-end. So I am  wondering whether-- as cautious as I know you have  been and as accurate as I know the num bers are--we ar e really going to see that ki nd of swing over that short a period of tim e as a consequence of Y2K. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I would just reiterate the t hought that we have really very sm all effects built in here. When they are annualiz ed, they whip th ese num bers around. In the recen t NAPM survey at m idyear, one of the que stions ask ed of the purch asing m anagers was what they m ight do. We tried to do som e back-of-the-envelope calculations based on those numbers. And I can tell you from  just looking at that, in m anufacturing materials it is a m ultiple of  the inventory ef fects we have built in he re. If people beg in to get a little panicked--if they get stirred up by the end-of-the-world TV program s or articles that undoubtedly  will be offered in th e closing m onths of this year--the $25 worth of precautio nary expend itures per ho usehold th at we built into  this forec ast will be a fraction of  what will oc cur. Now, som e of this will just m ean th at stocks will run down in som e places because firm s will not have produced enough to accomm odate th at dem and, so it will all come out in the wash here. But I think the pot ential is for even bigge r swings than this. 6/29-30/99 27 It may be that people will be sufficiently r eassured only to take a few hundred dollars out of their bank account, but that’s sym bolic of th e kind of concerns that  will lead people to do som e other things as well. I guess I’m  som ewhat conditioned by m y experience here in W ashington, D.C. when there is the slight est hint of a possible snowstorm  and people buy six m onths’ worth of toilet paper. Peopl e do get carried away at tim es. And for a purchasing m anager, the cost of ending up with a few extra m aterials on  the she lf that can be used up in the first weeks or m onths of 2000 is not very high as opposed to being short in what is needed to keep the production lines  running. So we are highlighting som ething that potentially could m ake for a considerable  amount of noise in the data. In term s of your num bers and what we would be pres enting to the Congress in the Hum phrey-Hawkins report, on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-qua rter b asis the effects are s o sm all as to be trivial. So I don’t think th ere is cause to m ake any big to -do about this other than to highligh t the bit of  uncer tainty tha t exists about what m ight occur at the end of the year. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I hav e one question on a different subject. On your Chart 4 on financial fragility, when we m easure debt levels against e ither the value of household financial assets or household net worth or we lo ok at corporate debt relative to m easures that incorpo rate the valu e of the stock m arket, are we kidding ourselves to som e extent? Shouldn’t w e be looking at it against som ething that doesn’t take into account the value of assets tha t, when they  declin e, might te nd to weaken the position s that we think a re strong only because equ ity assets are so overvalu ed? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I think there is m uch to be said f or that po int, a nd that is why I focused on the ratios I have here. I focused in these Survey of Consum er Finance runs on proportions of paym ents to incom e, thinki ng that that represen ts people’s ongoing cash flows. As I noted, for share holders that m ay include som e realized capital gains. But even if the m arket goes down, I suspect som e people in their panic m ight realize som e capital gains, so they will get som e cash from  that in som e instances. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. But hasn’t corporate debt as a percentage of GDP gotten fairly sizable these days? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. As a percent of GDP, sure. In the recent period , corporate d ebt has been rising relatively rapidly. Again, it’s a question of wh at balance sheet ratios one wants to look at. Many firm s have a good d eal of cash right now, so I don’t think the 6/29-30/99 28 corporate balance sheet pictur e looks particularly troubles ome. And I don’t think the behavior of the rating agencies suggests th at there has been an y clear deterioration. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. That certainly has not happened. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOL E. On the Y2K issue, I don’t think there is any po tentially im portan t event since I have been an econom ist about wh ich we have less professional basis for speculating. [Laughter] I really don’t. It seem s to m e that the role for us here is to ensure that the things we say try to minim ize the impact of this event. The kind of thing we should say is that, based on everything we know about all the preparations that we and everybody else have m ade, there is no reason for any rational consum er or any rational business to do anything that is goi ng to show up in the aggregate data. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Go for it, Bill! 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. That is w hat I think w e could offer as econom ists. As for trying to speculate about things on which we have  no professional knowle dge, I just don’t know what to say about them . 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Further questions or comm ents? 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Karen, on your chart 12 ent itled “U.S. Current Account to GDP Ratio” what assum ptions do you have for your baseline?  How did you get the baseline? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. The ba seline starts with  the Greenbook forecast and the initial extension that is sort of  implicit in the Bluebook. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. In the B luebook, okay. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON. The ba seline brings growth  in activity abroad and in the United States back to potential and then holds it at pot ential. That is of cr itical importance to this particular model becau se the m inute we decide what that g rowth rate is going to be and multiply it tim es elasticities, we’ve a nswered a lo t of the ques tions abou t what is goin g to happen to trade. The elasticities are given so that there is no s cope within this m odel f or any type of feedback between the factors that  might be driving dem ographics or driving savings and investm ents to change the propensities to im port and to export. But we did in the blue line sort of exogenously adjust those to see what would happen if we thought there were reasons to believe that they m ight m ove back in  a favorable direction. We were addressing the questions of “how m uch would that have to be? ” and “what would it 6/29-30/99 29 look like if it happened?” But otherwise it’s  our best guess of what potential is in the different countries that we modeled, plus the Bluebook assumptions with respect to the United States and a 1½ percent real appreciation of the dollar. Embedded in that also are some assumptions about interest rates and the like that have to be there to flesh out the curren t acco unt. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Refresh m y memory, what is th e import elasticity us ed in the baseline? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON. For the United States it is approxim ately 2. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH. I had not seen the Adm inistration forecas t shown here. Is this the growth forecas t in th e recen t bud get es timates that just cam e out in the newspapers that add ed something lik e a tr illion d ollars to the surplus over a 10- year period?  Given the size of their add ition to the su rplus, their estim ate of growth is very, very m odest. So by the FOMC’s standards even that would be  an underestimate, right?  Does all that follow? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. That’s what I was sugges ting. These are the num bers from the Mid-session Review that was pub lished yesterday. They have characterized it as b eing in line with the Blue Chip forecas t and conservative. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. In point of fact it is quite a bit below the Blue Chip. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I don’t know what the longer- term num bers they m ight have from the Blue Chip forecast lo ok like. But I m ust say that they h ave tended to err on the lo w side, I think publicly and purposely in their pr ocess, which makes som e sense if they are trying to be cautious about counting revenues.  On the other hand, it m ay skew a fiscal policy decision by suggesting that things are tighter than the num bers m ight otherwise have indicated. There is clearly a political elem ent in that decision. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. They we re on the lo w side in February, too, you know. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Yes, they’ve tended to be very, very low. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. One has to be a little careful about  translating that growth forecast into th e surplus num bers beca use the so-called technical adjustm ents are overwhelm ingly im portant. It is quite possibl e--I don’t know if this is true, I’m  just saying it’s a possibility--that their GDP for ecast can com e in low and they overwhelm  it 6/29-30/99 30 by technical adjustm ents that would create a big surplus. So, we have to look at the detail. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. In fact, what little insight we have would suggest that their surplus numbers loo k on the low  side re lative to ours in part because they put in higher expenditure num bers than seem  to be in train at this point, as opposed  to it being sim ply the difference in our econom ic assumptions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. But t hey are making very significant projections into th e future. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Sure. Fortunately, we have not gotten into 15-year budget forecasting yet. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I hope you don’t have to bite your tongue! [Laughter] President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Karen, I would like to go back to  the baseline forecast on the bottom  of Chart 12 that Tom  Hoenig m entioned. As I understand it, in those baseline numbers you have the dollar depreciating m ildly in real term s. If I understood Peter’s litany of things that m ight com e back to ha unt us--having to do especially with the euro and the yen--they seem  to im ply that the eu ro and the yen m ight both depreciate relative to the do llar once m arket percep tions change. That is, the a ttitude right now m ay be that the Japan ese are succeed ing in stabilizing the y en, but we don’t expect th at to last. If that is right, these num bers would look even worse, presum ably. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON. Well, the m odel that is em bedd ed in these two charts was put together by the International Finance Division tw o years a go. And it came to som ewhat less fearsom e conclus ions because th e dollar is two years’ w orth of appreciation low er now and we have not had two years of full-bl own U.S. deficits piling up and so forth. We said the sam e thing then, and in fact th e world went completely the opposite way. Even though  we said then that the cu rrent accoun t would begin to get alarm ing and the projections were inevitable, the num bers have gone in the other dir ection for two years. So there is n o sense in w hich I m ean this ch art to be telling you wh at is going to happen starting tomorrow. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. No, I understand that. That’s fine. 6/29-30/99 31 

[SECTION]

MR. JOHNSON. I’m only flagging the proble m that is out th ere, which is  that to the extent Japan’s economy turns down, there is  som e possibility that m arkets m ay react negativ ely o nce the dus t is all se ttled and what  is really going on is clear. And if Japan continues to drag its feet about som e of th e more im portant policy adjustm ents, we c ould indeed see yet m ore years in which the problem in fact gets w orse before it gets better. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. If I could ju st clarify m y comm ents, in  the short run I am  more worried about a rapid yen appreciation such as the one we had in 1997-98--that kind of episode that they’re currently bo ttling up. That’s not a forecast of where it will all co me out in the wash once the Japanese econom y settles down. But it’s th e oscillation of the portfolio effect in and out of the Japanese financial sector--rushing out, rushing in--that could give us a burst. That’s what they ar e resisting now, they th ink. So there’s just more volatility there in the shor t run. In the long run I wouldn’t stake m y bets there. The weak euro/strong yen is the short-run scenario. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further qu estions?  If not, why don’t we take a short break for coffee. [Coffee break]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Would so mebody like to begin the round table discussion?  President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Twelfth District economy has expanded at a solid p ace in recent m onths, with growth accelerating from  earlier in the year. District payrolls incr eased at an average annual rate of 3¼ per cent during April and acceleration was dom inated by California, wh ere payrolls exp anded at a 3 ¾ percen t average ann ual pace in April and M ay, well abo ve the 2 percent pace of the firs t quarter. Payrolls also grew rapidly in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. In Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington em ploym ent growth slo wed in r ecent months, falling be low the nation al pace of growth. The construction and services sect ors continue to be th e strongest sectors of the District econom y. Employm ent growth in  construction w as particularly rapid, up by 10½ percent at an annual rate during the two m onths ended in May. The rate in the services sector was 5¼ percent. District m anufac turing payrolls have declined slowly in 1999, although em ployment has stabilized in  recent m onths. Increased dem and for 6/29-30/99 32 computers, consum er electron ics, and  telecommunication produc ts, as we ll as the resurgence of m any econom ies in Asia, ar e boosting sales and orders throughout the high-tech manufacturing sector. Although improved m arket conditions have  yet to generate  significant job growth am ong District high-tech m anufacturers,  employm ent levels have stabilized and output is rising. Thus far, productivity gains and increases in the average workweek have allowed m any high-tech m anufacturers to  meet production goals without boosting employm ent. However, these f irms will likely need to in crease em ployment in the ne ar future since they anticip ate an acceleration in th e growth of sales and orders and m ost have absorb ed what had been exces s capacity in their existing em ploym ent bases. Turning to the national outlook, data since the last m eeting have done little to change our perception of the basic f orces sh aping the economy. In our forecast, demand is expected to rem ain strong in the near te rm, allowing real output growth to average more than 3 percent over the rem ainder of th is year. However, recent increases in interest rates com bined with an expected flattening of the stock m arket should start restraining dem ands toward the end of the year. Consequent ly, we expect real output growth to slow to about  2¾ percent next year. Recent high levels of dem and have not tran slated  into high in flation because of the favorable developm ents on the supply side . Consequently, core CPI stands roughly unchanged in our forecast. However, as I mentioned last tim e, the recent history of forecast erro rs makes it h ard to be v ery conf ident about any forecas t of this  split b etween output grow th and inflation. Because there is no way to determ ine the size or persistence of the current supply shock at this point in time, it is really hard to tell how fast the econom y can grow without inflationary pressures. Forecasts th at utilize th e level of the output gap can be quite m isleading, as illustrated b y the staff papers distrib uted by Don Kohn. This uncertainty suggests p lacing more em phasis on nom inal GDP growth, which tends to internalize offsetting m ovements in inflation and output growth. And its use as  an indicator can be sim ilar to the way we used the m onetary aggregates in the past. In this  framework, the sm all de celeration in annual spending growth over the la st three years to a rate aro und 5 percent helps m e to be more reasonably optim istic about inflation. However, I am  not com pletely comfortable 6/29-30/99 33 with recent developm ents, as nom inal GDP ha s grown at a 6½ percent rate over the last two quarters. Thus, I will be watching the spend ing num bers carefully to determ ine whether th is is a one- time event o r the beginning of a sustained increase in nom inal spending. Thank you.

MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Kansas City District’s econom y remains quite solid, as I reported last tim e. Retail sales ar e well a bove year-ago levels. Real estate sales and construction activity remain quite healthy. Manufacturing activity actually shows som e further signs of im proving, following an earlier period of weakness. Factory m anagers are reporting to us that capacity utiliza tion is  up consider ably f rom earlier m onths this year and nearly back  to year-ago levels. Energy activity has continued to  improve in June acco rding to our producers in the region. The farm econom y rem ains in a deep slum p, and I would say that we are hearing increasing reports from  rural Am erica that the farm  downturn is  beginning to hurt Main Street and that we are going to see som e repe rcussions on the banks. Having said that, the labor m arket in our  District rem ains extrem ely tight. The District’s unem ploym ent rate edged down to about 3½ per cent this past month. And there is now som e additional anecdo tal evid ence that pers istently tight labo r markets ar e limiting growth in som e District areas. Just as one exam ple, Am erican West announced it will m ove 180 jobs from the Kansas City area b ecause it can not find peo ple to fill th e jobs there. Now, where they are going to m ove them  to isn’t all that c lear, but cer tainly they can ’t fill the jobs in the Kansas City area. Turning to the national scene, I continue to expect the trend in econom ic activity to moderate by the end of next year. For now, though, I foresee anot her year of strong econom ic activity, with real GDP growing on average about 4 percent this year and slowing to an average of  just above 3 percent next year. As for m y views on the inflation outlook, I would note a couple of points. Similar to what Bob Parry just said, m y stronger fo recast represen ts yet anoth er upward revision in the ou tlook. I notice in the consen sus forecas t that o thers s hare th at view. I continu e to be im pressed by the m omentum  of the U.S. econom y as we m ake these adjustm ents, 6/29-30/99 34 and I also continue to be im pressed by the f act th at the inflation num bers are still coming in at a m odest level. Having said that, I still ju dge that the risks on the inflation ou tlook are on the upside. First of all, as I have said before, the funds rate is 75 basi s points less than it was a year ago w hen the econ omy was already expand ing at a fairly good pace.  Since then, the financial turm oil that occurr ed las t fall has largely subsided, risk spreads are in fact lower, and growth is projected to rem ain str ong. So in that context,  I think the stance of monetary po licy is acco mmodative. When one looks at M2 growth, while it has slow ed most recen tly, it rem ains relatively strong--inc reasing by abou t 8 percent o ver year-ago levels. And as others have noted in a different  context, there are som e signs that inflation expectations are rising. The inflation pr emium embedded in the Treasury inflation-protected securities has been rising since last fall. So, while recognizing that inflation is modest, I believe there is som e upside inf lationar y risk in the context of this very strong econom y right now.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Business cond itions in th e Seventh District remain quite good. Light motor vehi cle sales in May matched their 12-year high reached last Decem ber, and industry contacts  suggest th at Jun e sales will exceed th e strong year-to-date s ales pace of 16.4 m illion un its. Net orders for m edium and heavy-duty trucks continue to r un above long-run averages. Comm ercial constructio n activ ity in Chicago has  gained m omentum  in recent months but with few signs of speculative act ivity. Lenders and investors are requiring that 50 percent of office space be p re-lease d, an d that is one reason som e previous ly announced projects are not m aking it off the drafter’s table. More generally, our m anufacturing sector is still perfor ming well. For exam ple, the Chicago Purchasing Managers survey resu lts for June show the overall index m oving further above the 50 percent level, from  57.9 per cent in May to 60 percent in June. That survey is going to be released to the p ublic tom orrow at 10:00 a.m . Even t he steel industry reports a bit of improvem ent, as capac ity utilization rates have risen noticeably over the past few m onths , although they re main significantly below typical operating levels. 6/29-30/99 35 Moreover, as Tom  Hoenig just m entioned, conditions in the ag sector generally remain depressed, with no significant im provem ent likely for som e time even with improving conditions abroad. Nonetheless, our District labo r markets are still ex tremely tight. We spoke with contacts at two nationa l temporary service firm s headquartered in our District and both re ported continued difficulty in fi nding workers to satisfy clients’ demands. One contact even said that he had shifted all of his m arketing expenditures to finding workers and none to finding clients. Both firm s also indicated that we have passed the peak for Y2K-related hi ring of technical personnel. On the price side, we increasingly hear reports of  price increa ses that stick, both for final and interm ediate goods. Auto dealers and som e casual dining establishm ents have been able to raise prices m odestly, a nd a few retailers indica ted that strong sales results were not as dependent on promotional activity as before. The Chicago Purchasing Managers R eport for June again indicate d that relatively m ore respondents were experiencing increases in prices paid th an declines. The prices paid com ponent, seasonally adjusted, went from  52.5 percent in May to 57.2 percent in June. That is the fourth consecutive m onth above 50 percen t, and  it is the h ighest sin ce Decem ber of 1997. Before turning to our national ou tlook, I’d like to  summarize som e recent discussions about produ ctivity th at we had at ou r Bank. At our m ost recent board of directors m eeting, which the Chairm an at tended, we heard som e very optim istic assessm ents of the prosp ects for e-co mmerce to  increase productivity in  several sectors of the econom y. Our directors reported on how advances in comput er technology have affected their particular com panies and i ndustries--m anufacturing, retailing, banking and services in particular--and on the potentia l for these technological advances to funda mentally change the nature of our econom y. The reports consistently noted that technology has enhanced productivity pretty m uch across the board a nd that its potential to yield further productivity im provem ents seem s limitless. On the other hand, at our Academ ic Advisory Council m eeting one participant presented a paper suggesting th at the recen t pickup in productivity growth is due only to: (1) m easurem ent changes; (2) the norm al cyclical response of productivity; and (3) acceleration of productiv ity growth  in the com puter industry it self--no t in industries using computers but in the inform ation processing and equipm ent sector alone. The analysis 6/29-30/99 36 suggests that productivity gains in the com puter manufacturing sector have not spilled over to the rest of the econom y, at leas t in the data, casting som e doubt on how widespread productivity increases have bee n. Obviously, productiv ity growth is a key issue confronting us today. Turning to the national outlook, our views are reasonably sim ilar to those in the Greenbook. Our forecast for core C PI inflation is, however, a couple of tenths high er for next year. More im portantly, even with a ti ghtening in policy sim ilar to that assum ed in the Greenbo ok, we see further acceleration in inflation in 20 01. So the upside risks remain substantial. The downside risks, on the other hand, are considerably less than those we faced when we last adjusted policy. Most of the news on the world econom y is suggesting more streng th than prev iously e xpected. Moreov er, risk spreads, while s till somewhat elevated, are b ack to m ore reas onable levels, and creditworthy borrowers are finding financing. Meanwhile, the sam e factors that have been propelling the rapid expansion of dom estic dem and--high inco me growth, high wealth levels, and high consum er confidence--rem ain in place. So it s eems to m e that it’s the tim e to begin the process of tightening policy.

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an. The New En gland economy remains strong, with tight labor m arkets re portedly constraining business growth, and strong residential and commercial real esta te markets, particularly in the Boston metropolitan  area. In the  words of  one of  the Bank’s dir ectors, Boston is “ absolutely boom ing,” though this description likely does not apply equally to all cities in the District. In May, the total num ber of people employed in the region fell a bit from  its April level, bu t employm ent continues to expand at  a pace that is higher than its long-term trend. The unem ploym ent rate rem ains well below the nation’s,  although it has bounced around a bit in som e states and ended slightly hi gher in May than in April. After virtually no growth in 1998, the region’s labor force in 1999 is growing in every state except Massachusetts. Given all the stories one hear s about hard-to-find labor, however, one has to believe th at these new  entran ts to the la bor force do not have the skills for the jobs being created. 6/29-30/99 37 All of the Bank’s contacts recently have  com plained that h iring difficulties are constraining growth. Technical staff have b een hard to com e by for som e time, but job vacancies seem  to abound in every service a nd retail estab lishment. The job m arket for summer teenage em ploym ent is strikingly good if  my 17-year old and his friends are any indication of  that m arket. All of them don’t have m inimum-wage jobs  as com pared with the experience of m y daughter and her friends a couple of years ago. In fact, m y son is now m aking $9 an hour for selling C Ds, which he  would probably do for free. [Laughter] Moreover, we hear stories--and I know of actual exam ples--of tem porary help firms reaching out to teenagers who have keyboard skills and  offering them $12 to $14 per hour to f ill the vacan cies the firms have durin g the summ er. Our contacts with temporary help firm s more generally, like President Moskow’s, see business as good to great, but with revenues constr ained by a lack of workers. IT staff are hardest to com e by, as has been the case for a while. Some temporary help firm s have broadened their base of workers to ligh t indus trial staff si mply because th ere is a better supply of low-wage workers; according to one contact, ev en form er welfare recipien ts are getting lucrative offers now. Amazingly, wage and price increases continue to be m oderate. Inflation as measured by the CPI abated slightly in the Boston m etropolitan area in recent m onths, largely due to a m ore sizable decline in fu el costs locally than nationally. Wages in manufacturing and retail are reported to be gr owing in the range of 3 to 5 percent this year, even given the dearth of supply. Firm s report that changes in organizational structure and in non-wage job enhancem ents su ch as training are being pursued in favor of wage increases. Residential real es tate prices for the re gion grew faster than  for the nation as a whole, and comm ercial real estate conditions  are strong in several metropolitan areas. Until quite recently, Boston enjoyed the lowes t Class A office space vac ancy rate in th e country and very low rates for Class B space as well. Rents for comm ercial space continue to rise and now exceed tho se in both New York and San Francis co. While h igh rates obviously m ean profits for Boston build ing owners, they could also deter new or expanding businesses from  locating in Boston. Indeed, the latest data show downtown vacancy rates have doubled from  their extrem ely low level, th ough they continue to b e 6/29-30/99 38 below the national average. Assum ing these data are not an aberration, there m ay be some evidence of a cooling of de mand at current price levels. Turning to the nation al scene, our forecast- -like those of others--is s imilar to the Greenbook forecast. Econom ic activity is p rojecte d to slow this year and next as a result of moderating growth in consum ption due to buyer satiation and a waning wealth effect from  levelin g stock m arket prices. Business inv estment also  slows in ou r forecas t, especially for com puters, and net export s exert a continuing though sm aller drag. Actually, in our forecast the growth in exports  turns m oderately positive this year, g iven expectations about growth in foreign count ries. In our view GDP growth in 1999, Q4 over Q4, will be about 3 ½ percen t, not un like the Greenbook, and will then declin e to the high 2 percent area in 2000. We, like the Boar d staff, have now provided for a slightly higher grow th potential for the economy at about 2¾ percent, at least for a period of tim e. And in our view, growth in 2000 will slow to abou t that level and thus unemploym ent will stay rou ghly flat. However, without a policy change, ou r forecas t suggests th at core inflation cou ld rise in 20 00--as does the Gree nbook forecast--but the increase is larg er and takes co re price inflation to aroun d 3 percen t, which is clearly unaccep table in m y view. Now, there is no doubt that this forecast is surrounded by a cloud of uncertainty. Certainly all the papers we ha ve received since the last m eeting have pointed to the various sources of that uncertainty and the re asons to be agnostic about projections of both output gaps and inflationary  growth. Indeed, when I look at our track reco rd at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the track record of the Comm ittee in general, we have been underestim ating growth and overestim ating inflation for some period of tim e. Perhaps our assessm ent of a positive out put gap is wrong and later data will provide am ple evidence of why we’ve been seei ng such low inflation. But perhaps later data will confirm  both our current assessm ent and our concern that tem porary factors have played a large role in the current run of econom ic good fortune. The effect of som e of these tem porary factors is clearly waning. In particular, estim ates of trade-weighted external growth are rising for both 1999 and 2000, which should affect both the dem and for U.S. exports and the supply of excess cap acity worldwide. Absent tighter policy, financial imbalances now evidenced in high st ock m arket PE ratios and in the sizable 6/29-30/99 39 growth in corporate and personal debt, even  though it’s affordable, m ay well deepen and pose threats when policy does tighten or a slowdo wn occurs as a result of other factors. Clearly, there are risks o n the downside--t he external deficit and the related low saving rate, just to nam e a couple. But the upside risks of increased pressure on capacity from  worldwide growth and the potential fo r growing financial im balances now seem both greater and m ore pressing.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus.

MR. BROADDUS. For the sake of variety, let me reve rse th e usual order of m y regional comments and tell you that not everything is great in our District. We have two problem  sectors: agriculture and textiles. Agricultural and fa rm prices r emain low f or the most part, as does farm  incom e. That situation has been exacerbated m ost recently by a drought; we have had very little rainf all. With respect to textiles, we continue to hear reports of plant closings in Virginia and th e Carolinas; m ost of the business is going to Mexico. These closings depre ss the areas where these p lants are lo cated --and especially in those three states th at’s usually sm all towns--even though m any laid-off textile workers are able to find altern ative employm ent in the curren tly very tight labor m arket. Outside of these two sectors, though, it’s generally the sam e old story around our region: robust consum er spending and housi ng activity, a revival in m any m anufacturing industries, and continued excep tionally tight labor m arkets pr etty m uch across the board. According to the information we have-- both anecdotal and a few hard numbers-­consum er spending m ay actually hav e accelera ted in our reg ion in May and June. Car sales and sales of appliances and othe r housing-related durable goods have been particularly strong. A lot of that hefty household spending obviously is com ing from consum er borrowing. Some of our banking direct ors tell us that de linquencies are rising and that they are seeing, and are m ore con cerned about, consum er ba nkruptcies. So there are som e hints of im balances in the m arket fo r consum er credit, at least in our area. But the m ost signif icant im balance that we have in our region clearly is still in labor m arkets, especially f or skilled and  semi-skille d constr uction workers. Shortages o f these workers are widespread now, despite a fairly signifi cant influx of gue st workers from  Canada and especially Mexico into the Carolinas and Virg inias. Some builde rs tell us that they a re actually turning away bus iness because of this dearth of workers. 6/29-30/99 40 Beyond skilled construction workers, m any busin esses tell us that it’s increasingly hard to find reasonably com petent entry-level workers for just about any business. We’re told th at some McDonald’s s tores are now stuffing em ployme nt applications in the bag with the burger and fries. We hear the same stories that Michael Moskow and Cathy Minehan m entioned about the tem p agencies. They have to scrape the barrel and it’s hard to find anything resem bling quality workers. Not surprisingly in this environm ent, we hear an increasing num ber of anecdotal repor ts about m ore aggressive wage dem ands than we’ve seen heretofore and som e actual increases in wages in particular industries and local areas. I have a brief report about the First District for you, Cathy. One of our econom ists has a close friend who has a house in the Boston area. The f riend got an estim ate last year for an addition to his hous e but didn’t have the work done. He got an estim ate again just recently, a year later, a nd it’s up about 30 percen t. That’s really extrao rdinary! On the national econom y, I’ll be brief. I don’t have any special insights on the outlook at this point. I was very pleased to see the May CPI report. Obviously, the A pril CPI really scared m e; if we had gotten a re peat of that in May, I would have been concerned that we were behind the curve. I suspect a lot of other pe ople would have been concerned as well. So the May report was a relief, but I don’t think we’re out of danger yet. The Greenbook is projecting a fairly si zable deceleration in  the growth of domestic dem and in the second quarter now e nding and in the third quarter. I think the staff m akes a good case for this; I, to o, exp ect so me deceleration in dem and. Heaven knows, I hope we get so me deceleration! But, frankly, I just don’t see m uch hard evidence of it yet; cert ainly I don’t see it in m y region. What I see is continued robust household dem and for goods, services, and housi ng, big increases in our trade deficits, and help wanted signs all over the place. In sho rt, we seem  to have a fairly significan t overall m acroeconom ic imbalance currently. More specifically, I thi nk we have a classic case of excessive growth in dom estic dem and. I’m worried that we m ay well be fueling that with an excessiv ely accomm odative m onetary policy. Thank you.

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. As is usually the case, conditions in our region have changed only at the m argin be tween m eetings. Retail sales rem ain quite healthy. A num ber of retailers are actually telling us  that they expect the third quarter to be as good as or even better than the second quarter. As I’ve noted before, tourism  is a particul arly interesting part of our economy and an area where we often get early signals of a turn in activity or of people’s outlooks. In the tourism  industry bookings rem ain strong; th ey are not growing quite as fast as they were a year ago but are still at very high levels . This is th e first tim e in a while in ou r surveys of the District’s tourism  people that  we haven’t heard grum bling about the falloff in visitors from  Latin Am erican, Canada, or Europe. There is a growing sense that there haven’t been in the area for a while, com e on down! [Laughter] Construction is still at high levels. We are seeing som e slowing in the rate of growth in single fam ily perm its, but that’s offset by quite strong nonresidential construction. We’ve recently heard new c oncerns about overbuild ing in comm ercial projects in Orlando. In oil and gas, the highe r oil prices that have  prevailed for a while now have shown through in a m odest uptick in drilling activity  after a long period of Our m anufacturing activity, as m easured  by em ploym ent growth, m ay be a bit less robust than for other District reports included in the Beigebook. Our im port-sensitive industries like apparel, paper, and prim ary m etals have seen declines. At the same time, there’s an op timism that we will begin to see, or m ay already be seeing, s ome turnaround as the econom ies of our tr ading partners begin to im prove. An old story: Labor m arkets are still ti ght, and outsized wage increases are still being repo rted, m ostly in certain hig h-skilled  jobs. A recent exam ple of noticeably large increases was at Ingalls Shipyard, where a th ree-year contract provides for a 16.3 percent increase. Pricing pressures seem  to have in creas ed a bit at th e margin since the last meeting. As one our directors put it, m any of the business people she talks to are increasingly determ ined to pass on their cost increases. Health care is a good exam ple in our region. It’s an area where pressures are great and where we are seeing som e relatively large upward price adjustments. who is a m ajor 6/29-30/99 42 homebuilder in the region, also  reports that he has been ab le to pass through m any of the cost in creases that he’s seen in the b uilding trad es. On the national front, real GDP growth is  still outpacing m y expectations. Other than the effects of oil an d energy cos ts, measured inflation is not yet show ing the upw ard drift I thought we m ight see by now. Nevert heless, there have been som e marginal changes to the outlook in m y view, suggesting our assessm ent that the inflation risks are on the upsid e was in fact correct. Our GDP  projections for m ost of the recently depressed L atin Am erican and developing Asia n econom ies have been revised upward. While the turnarounds have not yet been refl ected in increases in U.S. exports and commodity prices o r in capital m arkets, we e xpect that the dem ands for and prices of real goods and services and productive inputs will rise. This should reverse m any of the favorable shocks that have slowed U.S. real GDP growth and tem porarily reduced the rate of increase in prices. Furtherm ore, I se e little on the dom estic side to suggest that there will be a significant sl owing in dom estic dem and duri ng the rest of this year. Employm ent rem ains strong and consum er incom e and spending are up. Business investm ent spending m ay slow som e, but it appears likely to continue to run ahead of past experience in a m ature expansion. Should the reversal of the positive external shocks occur as expected, that raises a funda mental question about the overall stance of  monetary policy. Would the associated run-up in m easured inflation reflect em bedded inflation that has been temporarily m asked by a series of favorable events?  Or w ould th e increase be temporary due to the nature of the fixed-weight inflation m easures and the f act that on ly relative prices of energy and commoditie s have inc reased? In general, relative price m ovements aren’t inherently infl ationary and they should be perm itted to play them selves out. Such  price p ressures would dissipate quickly as real and financial resources are reallocate d, as long as our policy stance prevents these relative price adjustm ents from  being passed on through the econom y as a  general price level adjustm ent. However, if we persist in maintain ing inte rest rates below what I believ e is lik ely to be the ir pre-shock equilibrium  levels , we may inadvertently be pursuing an easier and inherently inflationary m onetary policy.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The District econom y continues to perform very well. Indicativ e of this, the unem ploym ent rate  in the Twin Cities metropolitan  area is now 1.6 percen t. Actuall y, it has been at that lev el for several months, so I don’t believe it’s an aberration. Estim ates of the District unemploym ent rate are harder to com e by, but that rate is probably 3 percent or lower. Residential construction  activ ity is v ery strong. This probab ly will be a record year f or both hom ebuild ing and sa les in the Twin Cities area . Comm ercial cons truction is also stron g. Some of the national develope rs based in the Twin C ities tell us they a re seeing good business basically throughout the country. Consum er spending rem ains healthy, tourism  is doing fine, and manufactur ing for the m ost part is doing fine. Agriculture rem ains the b light on the landscape. As far as the national econom y is concerned, not surprisingly our VAR model remains quite optim istic. My own view is si milar. I might briefly comme nt on where I think the risks don’t lie. I don’t think there is a risk of a pr ecipitous slow ing of dom estic aggregate dem and; that seem s very unlikely to me. The risks abroad relative to what we thought six months or more ago clearly have  diminished; indeed, we’ve already talked today both about better p erform ance m aterializin g abroad an d forecasts f or econom ies abroad being m arked up. So I think in this  environm ent we can concentrate on sustaining the econom ic expansion by keeping inflation low. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The econom y in the Philadelphia region continues to grow steadily, with tig ht labor m arkets and low inflation. The outlook is for m ore of the sam e. Residentia l construction is str ong, with prices rising especially for upscale housi ng. Nonresidential co nstruction is brisk but not boom ing. Manufacturers report further gains and retailers are gene rally doing well. Hiring and retaining skilled em ployees rem ain the m ajor challenge. Although there are special incentives f or particular skills, the norm  for annual wage increases is still m ostly in the 3½ to 4 percent range and increases f or unionized  employees tend to fall in that range as well. 6/29-30/99 44 Turning to the nation, w e are at the point in this rem arkable expansion when the risk of accelerating inflation has to b e taken serio usly. Raisin g the federal funds rate as insurance ag ainst an overheating econ omy is largely a foregone conclusion at this meeting. The m ore important issue now is how to position ourselves going forward. Credibly resisting inflation also m eans being a credible evalu ator of  the inf lation th reat. To use an analogy, we need to be able to te ll the difference between a wolf and the family dog. Let’s be honest with ourselves: Current  and pipeline indicators of inflation look more like th e family dog than a wolf, and our forecasting m odels have fo r several years cried wolf  when ther e has been no wolf . How well will a p reemptive rationale f or raising the funds rate hold up with that kind of s upport?  Going forward we need to position ourselves so that we can evaluate the inflation risks on an ongoing basis and adjust monetary po licy accord ingly rather than box ourselves in un necessarily. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. The pace of econom ic growth in the Eleven th District h as slowed somewhat in the last few m onths. Slower activity has been concentrated in three areas: construction, energy, and e xports, particularly exports to  Mexico. Concerns about overbuilding  have surfaced recen tly, and constru ction activ ity of all types, both residential and commercial, has dipped. Energy com panies are behaving as though current levels of oil and gas prices are not sustainable. Their slowness to boost the rig count is probably driven in part by concerns  about OPEC’s ability to restrain output. Most OPEC m ember countries and others ha ve not cut production to the full extent of their agreement, and fiscal pressures m ay necessitate incr eased output, particularly by Venezuela. Mexico seem s to be having sec ond thoughts about agreeing to restrain its oil output. Mexico’s d ifficult f iscal situation ha s reduced its ability to ra ise spending on public works, a practice that is common in the year prior to a presidential  election. Next year’s election is expected to be close, so the inc entive to au gment reven ues f rom higher oil produ ction increases  every day. Future  oil prices will be determ ined by a race between increased OPEC and Mexican chea ting on output quotas and the growth of world dem and. Given the history of OPEC ’s output production agreem ents, Texas oil producers have good reason to rem ain cautious. 6/29-30/99 45 Turning to the national scene and focusing on issues tha t are relev ant to the policy Boehne’s foregone conclusion about what we are going to do tom orrow, what worries m e about that is that we m ay trigger an end to the grand experiment that we’ve been engaged in without seeing how far it could go. We held back while output surged and unem ployment declined to below levels prev iously thought inflationary, but inflation we end this experim ent, whether we intend to  or not, we will never know how far it co uld have gone. What has changed?  We had the April CPI report. But what about the May report? The twelve-m onth CPI, the headline num ber, has risen to converge with the core rate, but the change over that  twelve-month period was dr iven m ore by dropping off the first m onth of the period  than it was by a nything that’s happe ned m ore recently. We’re rightly worried about accelera ting inflation, but w e’re still in a deflationary world environm ent. We still h aven’t se en th e end of  the ef fects of  the collapse of  the iron curtain--all the new consum ers and worker s entering the world econom y for the first time. Beyond the iron curtain, we’ve had the co llapse of the curtain of protectionism  in Latin Am erica. We’ve had globalization in general. We’ve had the Internet and the convergence of technology. These ar e all deflationary forces. On the issue of a preem ptive m ove, we had preemption redemption in 1994, so why not now?  What’s different no w? In 1994 we had inflation in the pipeline. Sensitive commodity prices were rising ra pidly throughout that year. Now they aren’t rising. They are barely of f their m ultiyear lows. Another im portant difference between 1994 and 1999 is that we began 1994 with the pedal to the m etal. We had 3 percen t nom inal short-term interest rates and about 3 percen t inflation, yielding real short- term interest rates of zero. Now we have a 4¾ percent federal funds rate  and 2 percent inflat ion--or less by som e measures. So we have real short-term interest rates of about 3 percent now and m aybe 4 percen t real long-term  interes t rates. Asia has perhaps started to heal, which will rem ove a deflationary force on our own econom y. But, rem ember, comm odity prices were falling bef ore the Asia cr isis. Deve lopments in Asia and Russ ia jus t accelerated the 6/29-30/99 46 prices due to the strong dollar, but the dollar is still pretty strong. On the question of slack in our econom y, the low unem ployment ra te sugg ests that we have little or none. But the lo w capacity utilization rate, under 80 percent, suggests otherwise. And our economists tell m e that capac ity utilization is a better predictor of future inflation than unemplo yment. We should not forget the slack elsewhere in the global econom y: Asia stil l has slack, both in labor and m anufacturing capacity; Eu rope is weak  and sluggish; and m uch of Latin Am erica is still in recessio n. If it’s rea l growth we’re worried abo ut, I for one believe that  rapid supply side technology-driven real growth is  disinflationary, not inflationa ry. But if you’re a strict demand sider, take heart from  the Dallas Fed’ s recent forecast of real grow th in the second quarter. Our forecast was, believe it or  not, 2.9 percent, and that was before our staff saw the Greenbook. We’re really good at forecasting backwards! [Laughter] With labor productivity growing an averag e 4 percen t over the fo urth quarter and the first quarter, it could decline by half and still be  2 percent. Add on a 1 percen t increase in labor supply and that would gi ve us noninflationary 3 percen t growth for som e time to come. Turning to P eter Fisher’s fourth point a while ago, I think the biggest argum ent for tighten ing at th is meeting is tha t so many of us have threaten ed it that the Comm ittee would probably lose face and lose credibility if it didn’t raise the funds rate by at least ¼ point. But even then, if we kept the asym metric directive, I think the m arkets would remain nervous and turbulent over the next Fe d-watch period. If I had the deciding vote, I probably w ould vote fo r a sm all tig htening just  because of the box we’re in. But sin ce I won’t have the deciding vote or even a key vote, I rem ain to be convinced.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Second District’s econom y rem ains strong, though growth  has clearly slowed from its brisk first-quarter pace. There are no indi cations of broad-based price pressures. Employm ent in the District grew at a 1½ pe rcent annual rate in April and May, m atching the first- quarter pace but do wn from  2 percen t in 19 98. Retail ers report that sales were strong in May  and early June, with less downward pressures on se lling prices than earlie r in the year. The 6/29-30/99 47 housing m arket rem ains generally strong, t hough new construction has cooled from  its vigorous first-quarter pace. Manhattan’s office market has been stable in the second quarter, with  vacancy rates little chan ged a nd ren ts rising at a more subdued pace th an in 1998. Purchasing m anagers indicate that manufac turing activity was m ixed in May, while there were reports of an upturn in co mmodity prices. Local banks report a dip in loan dem and, som e tightening in lending st andards, and ongoing declines in delinquency rates. The national econom y, based on the most recen t data, is continuing to gro w rapid ly and without in creased inflation, because productivity  growth is n ot only maintaining the approxim ately 3 percent level w e have seen since late 1998 but if anything is improving. Our read on the sec ond quarter is that productivity m ay have grown at an annual rate of 4 percent or even m ore. As one of the later converts to the view that the econom y is behaving rem arkably differently from  the past, I think it is im portant to rem ind ourselves what we should believe in and what we do not have to m ake any leap of faith to believe. To deny that the econom y has been showing m uch be tter producti vity since 1995 is sim ply to deny the facts. How long will th is improved producti vity last?  At what level of improved productivity  will th e eco nomy settle? We do not know the answers to tho se questions. Should this lack of certainty a bout the future confuse us in the present? I do not think it should. We don’t have to know how long the productiv ity im provem ent will last no r at what rate productiv ity w ill settle. Those answ ers will be kno wn only in the future. We don’t even know when. More im portantly, we do not need to know. Most of us believe that the lag in the effect  of monetary policy is  one to two years. That is as far into the future as we need to pe er. To try to loo k farther m erely confuses us and perhaps m akes us unwilling to be lieve the r eality that is s taring us in the f ace. I can see nothing that would alter m y belief that productivity will rise at least 2½ percent during the next one to two years. That m eans that the economy can  enjoy noninflationary growth well within th e forecasts of th e Greenboo k or of the New York Reserve Bank. We all say that labor m arkets are tight, but  they have been tight for several years and workers have been found--m any of them  in pockets of poverty where finding a good job, or any job, was a forlorn hope. Shoul d we be fighting th at high ly po sitive 6/29-30/99 48 developm ent for the good of the American peopl e? I think not. And yet the Am erican public and m arkets everywhere are waiting for us to pounce on growth and job creation and stifle them . Since I do not believe we s hould do that, I believe that our challenge is to clarify our strategy--first  to ourselves, then to th e public an d the m arkets. The m arkets are spend ing their tim e psychoanaly zing th is Committee ra ther than analyzing the real world. That is highly  counterproductive because it deprives our nation’s econom y of the balancing effects of  the norm al pulls of supply and dem and in financial m arkets. Never-ending heavy breathi ng by market watchers is convincing the American people that w e want to depr ive them  of inflation-free growth. Clearly, the general posture of the Federal Reserve should always be to rem ain highly alert to im balances, to forces whic h could end sustainable growth. Our policy regard ing price s tability on a continu ing philos ophical b asis should be seen as symm etric, as being against both deflati on and inflation. Our strategy, on the other hand, should vary with conditions. Deflation is sufficiently un likely at this time that we should have a strategic position of concern about  inflation. But we should not  be in a tactical position of being constantly poised to attack an enem y that does not appear visible to m e. We need to find a way to tactical symm etry--to a position where we, the public, and the Because of the public p erception of where we are, I do not th ink we can achieve tactical symm etry by taking no action at this meeting. However, when we discuss what action to take in a later portion of the meeting, tomorrow m orning, I am  absolutely convinced that it m ust take us to tactical symm etry, even  against a strategic background of concern about inflation. Thank you.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, it’s obvious  that everyone around the table is “chafing at the bit” to disc uss policy, and I’m  going to do m y part to behave in a disciplined f ashion here by just di scussing the outlook. In the Eigh th District th e story is very sim ple; it’s the sam e old story. We’re seeing exactly the sam e kinds of things that we have been seeing for a good num ber of months now. I make a special point of trying to talk to m y contacts about what seem s to 6/29-30/99 49 be different, what seem s to be on the radar scre en that hasn’t been there. My im pression is very clearly that firm s are successfully  managing their labor m arket pressures. For exam ple, is very concerned about  the labor m arket situation for his com pany. He says that its need ed employees at the Louisville hub. He says that the company is having a hard tim e all around the country--except in Philadelphia, Ed, by the way. He says he’s  having no problem in Philadelphia; I don’t know why the situation there is different. higher hiring referral bonuses and retention bonuses. So, clearly, th at com pany is concerned. On the other hand, who was quite concerned about his labor situation earlier in the spring, says that now his folks are able to find labor pretty readily though they are behind on IT staffing. What seem s to be happening is that case-by-case firm s are com ing up agains t the labor m arket pressures an d they ar e able to m anage the situation successfully. Of course, m anaging the situation in som e cases means that they are paying m ore wages or retention bonuses or som ething, so there’s perhaps som e up-creep in w ages involved, although obviously it is not showing up in the national statistics. Another thing that ha s com e on our radar screen is that our bank exam iners are express ing a little concern--I want to em phasize it’s a sm all degree of concern--about loan adm inistration in the banks. Credit dem ands are strong enough and loan officers are in tight enough dem and that our exam iners have the sense that som e of the banks they exam ine are sim ply not able to have disciplin ed loan adm inistration. So there m ay be a bit of sloppiness in that area that could produce som e problem s later on. No one is very concerned about it, bu t I m ention it b ecause it was the first tim e I really h ad heard abo ut that from  our exam iners. We have the sam e situation in agriculture and so f orth that has existed for som e time and has already been commented on by others, so I have nothing to add.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Jordan.

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. Several m eetings with bankers in sixteen of the western and northwestern counties of Ohio two weeks ago revealed somewhat of a paradox in that area in term s of a ve ry str ong regional economy but sim ultaneously a very vulnerable econom y. It’s an area where manufac turing often runs double the national average as a share of total em ployment; m ost of that is m otor vehi cle-related production. 6/29-30/99 50 Auto com panies and their vari ous suppliers are by far the largest absolute em ployers throughout that part of our region. So em ployment levels and personal incom e growth are very high and spending growth has been exceptionally strong. But bankers increasingly express their worries about personal bankruptcies; the stories about people who were current and then suddenly file f or bankruptcy have returned. They say it is fairly common to have two adults in a household using the entire paychecks from  all four of their jobs, includi ng all the ove rtime they cou ld get, to s ervice their debts. So when there is a loss of one of the jobs or loss of overtim e or illness or divorce, then that’s it. They can no longer service the debts. One banker em phasized the condition of his custom ers this way: He said  he is not worried about withdrawals around the tim e of the centu ry date chang e because h is custom ers don’t have any  money in th eir accounts to withdraw. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. We h ave heard that, too! 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. They s aid that their business custom ers continue to experience difficulty hiring, especially for entry -level pos itions. The bankers said they are often paying 18-year old teller trainees $11 to $12 an hour. Then they can’t hold the inexperienced people long enough to take adva ntage of their productivity after the period of training, but it has been im possible to recruit experi enced people. We also did a roundup of what was going on in tourism  in the region, so if you haven’t been there recently, com e on up! [Laughter] Given that the south shore of Lake Erie is a m ajor tourist destination [laught er] and tourism  companies are a big em ployer there, we talked to people at Cedar P oint, Geauga Lake, Sea World, and King’s Island Park to see what they were doing. Ticket prices are typically up 10 to 15 percent this year and these places are having a great deal of difficulty in recruiting em ployees. Cedar Point had openings for 3,700 summer workers an d in June they are running still about 200 short of their goal. They went to Europe , again hoping to recruit 500 workers as they did last year, and were able to get only  about 350. They increased the amount of subsidies for housing and for e mployee and em ployee fam ily discounts. And they increased their season-end rete ntion bonus by 50 percent; a work er receives $650 if he or she stays the full 14 weeks of the summer season. We hear sim ilar stories from  the other parks. Sea World and Geauga Lake contacts said that a significant num ber--about 1/5 of 6/29-30/99 51 the to tal--of  their conces sion stand s haven’t been opened an d probably will not op en this summer. Bankers are reporting s trong loan dem and for all types of loans and in ad dition are expressing concerns about credit quality. Some of our exam iners also  are starting to say that they are seeing very early s igns o f things they are not comfortable with. The ag sector is in very good shape in the sense that the planting was all done on time, conditions for planting were excellent, and since then we’ve had just the right amount of moisture and sunshine. So, as one said: All the farm ers need to do now is sit and wait for a drought or a flood someplace else ! But even th e low crop p rices are no t restraining the price of farm land. One banker said that he has custom ers who recently have been acquiring new land at $2,000 to $2,500 an acre that will not produce cash flow of $1,000 an acre at current crop prices. So buyers are either counting on commodity prices to go up or they plan to use the land for som ething else. I’m not sure what the logic of  that is. Also, f or the f irst time in a while for us, we heard reports of foreign investors--Swiss and Canadians in particul ar--buying farm lands or even raw wooded lands. That m ay reflect capital preservation efforts on the part of som e of the foreign investors. Our Sm all Business Advisory Council desc ribed commercial real estate activity, particularly shopping centers, as boom ing. One referred to an “explosion” of orders in the spring for hot tubs and in-ground and a bove-ground swimm ing pools. The problem is that labor shortages m ake it difficult to get the work done. So he went to Miam i to recru it 20 w orkers, som e with f amilies--he c laims they have g reen card s--and besides moving them to Columbus, Ohi o, he provided them  with housing as well. We also heard reports of rising m edical costs, all of that usual thing. In the building sector, w e were told that  fram ing contractors weren’t even bidding on som e proposed new projec ts. Addition ally, for som e projects they ha d planned to  start this summ er it now looks as if they m ay not ev en start digging or prep aring the s ites. We did hear so me reports, especially in  machine tools, of som e new orders com ing in from Asia and Latin Am erica. So that m ay be an early hint of positive developm ents there. We were told that a num ber of fast food restaurants in both central and northwest Ohio are often now open for drive-through business only. They don’t open the eat-in 6/29-30/99 52 facility because of a lack  of st aff. So I assum e that, quality  adjusted, one m ight call that a price increas e. A directo r in the national reta il trade business said that this year is going to be phenom enal and will go down as a banner yea r for retailer e arnings. He said retailer s are worried th at they are going to go into year-end with stocks th at are too low  to m eet what they think is going to be seasonally ve ry strong dem and for clothing and other nondurables. We heard a lot of reports of food pro cessing costs--refrigeration, transportation, container costs and so forth--rising fairly strongly. A director who specializes in came into this year expecting 800 nu mber and Intern et sales for all of 1999 to range between $300,000 and $400,000 but already had booked $5 m illion in such sales in the first five m onths of this year. Whether th at is a reflection of aggregate dem and or a s hift in dem and, I don’ t know. She fe els that discretionary incom e is high and rising very rapidly. Also, we heard reports that the structur al steel industry is im proving. Industry contacts said, in fact, that right now order books are full thro ugh the third quarter and that because of large cons truction p rojects, especially  stadium s, they expect to finish the year with a full book. Turning to the national econom y, I wouldn’t know what assumption to make about the fourth quarter of this  year and the first quarter of next year in any case. While it is no do ubt true that Y2K will f oster som e buying to ac cumulate sto cks of various nondurable goods in particular, I don’t know how I would go about m aking assum ptions regarding consum er behavior or business expenditures for durable goods or plant or equipm ent or even recruiting and hiring decisions . If Y2K gets to be a m edia event with the degree o f hysteria o r concern abo ut the futu re on the order of what we saw in the fall of 1990 looking toward Desert Storm and the Gulf W ar, we could have a very substantial negative impulse in the fourth quarter. And we would have to  wait to se e if that then reverses in the first quarter. I wouldn’t know how to quantif y the m agnitude of that. I can see it going both ways. Also, if people wa nt to enter the year-end period with a high degree of liquidity, that does im ply, other thi ngs the sam e, a slower rate of spending for 6/29-30/99 53 something. So Y2K m ay influence the balance sheets and cash flows of firm s as well as of households in a way that I wouldn ’t know how to put in to a forecast. I have com mented over the last year, year -and-a-half about the very rapid growth of personal incom e. In the spring of 1998 we  were looking at Gr eenbook projections of personal incom e decelerating into th e 3½ to  4 percent range and it has ru n 1 to 1½ percentage points faster than that. And that’s  great, as long as it stem s from incom e that people are really earn ing base d on what it is they produce.  I heard last week--and I haven’t had a chance to follow-up to see if it can be docum ented--that right now we’re experiencin g an inflow on the order of 1 m illion workers a year from  foreign countries , perm anent, I don’t have any inform ation. But the total is a v ery large nu mber--m uch larger than I would have thought--and it ce rtainly would contribut e to rapid personal incom e growth. We can see what the effect of the ra pid growth of de mand is on the dom estic econom y and, of course, we can see it in the rapid growth of imports at a rate that I certainly co nsider unsu stainab le. I take that  as the strongest piece of evidence of excess aggregate dem and in the dom estic econom y, and at som e point that surely has to be reversed. So I do continue to be concerne d about too m uch dem and chasing what we’re able to produce in the longer run in this econom y. I have a couple of comments on inflation. We continue to do research on various measures of inflation: We track the m edian CPI; we’ve also been looking at the regular CPI but using PCE weights. While the level of  the latter m easure m ay not be statistically significant, it has m oved up appreciably. In the first five m onths of this year it ran right at 3 percent, even with the drop we had in May. Now, for the first tim e in a couple of years, that m easure is running ahead of both the regular CPI and the m edian CPI that we track. So, that m easure is another way of l ooking at the concerns about inflation that we have. All I’m saying about it at this point is tha t it’s moving in an upward direction compared to what it has done in the last two years. One m ore comm ent on inflation numbers:  We began a project som e time ago, and are bu ilding a track record  now, with our own consum er price ou tlook surveys to compare with the Michig an survey’s percep tions of current in flation and f orecas ts of 6/29-30/99 54 future inflation. Our surveys have som e different questions and a lot m ore detail in term s of the breakdown on respondents. First, bo th perceptions of current inflation and expectations about future inflation have m oved up sharply. It’s the direction that’s important, not the levels, as far as I’m concerned at this m oment. Some of the inform ation that is starting to become avai lable on the breakdown of incom e levels, education levels, m ales versus fem ales we’re not sure how to interp ret. Consisten tly, females’ perceptions of current inflation a nd future inflation run 1 to 1½ percentage points ahead of m ales’ perceptions. We don’t have an expl anation for it. We even break the data down as to whether the respondent is a m ember of a  household and whether he or she is working or not working outside th e home. So, without getting into too m uch detail about levels right now, since the beginning of the year  all of these m easures have turned upward in each successive survey.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. When the Comm ittee m ade the th ird of its three cuts last fall, which was the fina l one that brought the fede ral funds rate to the level we have today, it was a close, difficu lt call. After a good deal of soul-searching, that action was taken largely--and please excuse  the use of this old war horse once again --as an inexpensive insuran ce policy, which could easily be reversed if the econom y appeared to be too strong. Very soon ther eafter what had at that tim e appeared on balance to be financially driven dow nside risk s began to m igrate. For a w hile, the risks appeared to be balanced,  but m ore recently they  seem to have moved ever more clearly  to the upsid e. Two groups of factors seem  to me to be driving this change. For one, the world econom y generally appears to have survived last fall’s financial crisis and to be beginning to turn upward. This is a healthy and welcom ed developm ent, of course, but it does cause problem s for U.S. m onetary policy because several things that have helped our policy mix m ay well be changing. Our expor ts could increase, adding to already very robust econom ic activity. World commodity pr ices could firm ; indeed, oil already has done so. The dollar’s foreign exchange valu e could begin to weak en, adding further to exports and raising im port prices in the Un ited States. All of this is potentially inflation ary. 6/29-30/99 55 Then there’s our rem arkably strong ec onom y, which should slow on its own but so far has refused to do so. Consum er confiden ce is still sky high. Real w ages are rising. Wealth continues to g row. Despite the recen t hesitan cy, the Dow Jones industrial average is up over 14 percent so far this y ear, and that’s not too shabby. Consum ption continues to increase at a ra pid pace, led by the big-ticket cyclicals lik e autos and hom es. Inventories are low and are li kely to be a short-term  source of further strength. Clearly, labor m arkets continue to tighten  as the econom y strains to keep up the beat. So far, strong productivity growth ha s made it possible to do so without visible inflation ary pressur es. But it se ems to m e that it would be a dangerous assum ption to be confident that this could go on indefinitely. Things have been and indeed rem ain wonderful. But there are lim its out there somewhere beyond which could lie serious trouble. Policy m ust, of course, focus one or more  years out, not on today. And within the context of that tim e frame, I think we’re  quite possibly in the danger zone now and should begin to respond. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I think the obvious question we’ve all been addressing or attem pting to a ddress in our own ways is: What has changed since the last m eeting?  In som e sens e I think not much has changed since then. The incom ing data continue to point to vigorous  grow th, which may well be above trend and therefore is of som e concer n, I think, to everybody around the table. Consum ers are clearly th e major engine for this growth, as  the recen t perso nal incom e and consum ption data am ply indicate. And while PCE growth may slow at some point, it is not slowing yet. The other side of this, as we all know, is that lab or markets c ontinue to b e tight. The unem ployment rate has been at 4.2 or 4.3 percent for three or four quarters now. That is starting perhaps, and I say perhaps, to sp ill ove r into c ompensation . Mike Pre ll’s chart num ber 5 indicates that av erage hourly earnings of production workers decelerated a bit ove r the last twel ve m onths compared to the previ ous twelve m onths. But if one looks m ore closely at the last  three months--that is, the early  part of this year--average 6/29-30/99 56 hourly earnings seem  to be picking up again to som ewhere in the 4 percent range. This obviously puts into stark relief the importa nce of ongoing improvem ents in productivity. There is con tinuing evid ence that bu sinesse s are investing heav ily in prod uctiv ity-enhancing technologies. The recen t shipm ents and orders data for communications equipm ent rem ain on a steep uptrend, as do the orders and shipm ents of office and computer equipm ent. The m ajor issue, obviously, is whether or not this capital deepening w ill tran slate into further increas es in the rate of productiv ity growth. On this issue I think  there’s anecdotal ev idence on both sides, but the jury is out. Against this backdrop of ongoing labor m arket tightness, ther e are a couple of conditions that m ay have changed. Here I’ ll say nothing new but I will reiterate wh at others have said. One change , obviously, is that the internat ional environm ent is not as threatening as it has been for m uch of the la st eighteen m onths. The staff forecast clearly shows som e uptick. More im portantly, in Apr il our exports posted the first gain in six months. Two industries where weak fo reign demand has depressed shipm ents-­construction m achinery and m etal working m achinery--both posted sizable increases in that it seem s as though comm odity prices have bottom ed out; the evidence is broader than just the oil side of it. Another perspective that I consider important is to look at ho w interes t-sensitiv e sectors of the econom y are behaving. Purcha ses of durable goods posted som e healthy gains in May. I think the housing market is  showing us a little of both strength and weakness here. The inform ation in front of us indicates that sales of new hom es and similarly sales of existing hom es fell in May. But if one looks at m ore tim ely measures, such as builders’ ratings of new home sales or applicati ons for hom e mortgages, those have risen from  April through June. So in addi tion to the auto sales that G overnor Kelley referred to, there’s som e evidence of streng th in other interest-sensitive sectors. As Vice Chairm an McDonough indicated, however, we’re not here to slow growth. Nor are we here to destroy jobs or to destroy wealth. We should be looking f or the earliest signs of inflation. We had a bit of  a surprise in the CPI number for April, but I think we w ere wise not to put too m uch weight on that; as the subsequent num bers indicated, perhaps som e of what we saw in  April was a bit of a fluke. The early 6/29-30/99 57 indicators of  inflation are very hazy but all point in the sam e direc tion. I’ve talked about commodity prices and average hourly earnings . In addition, Mike Prell brought to our atten tion the  PPI f or inte rmediate m aterials, which m oved up in March, A pril, and May-­three up ticks after declines in th at index in each  of the 10 previous m onths. There are a number of anecdotal stories a bout faster increases in prices  and wages, as we’ve heard around the table. When I put all this together, it does seem to me prudent to take out a little insur ance--to use th at phrase--but not to react m ore strongly than the incom ing inform ation warrants. We can debate whether or not we see a wolf or a wolf in sheep’s or dog’s clothing or even the fam ily dog, whichever it m ay be. But speaking of clothing, even in a balmy June it’s im portant that the emperor not be seen in public without clothes whatsoever! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Try to top that, Governor Meyer! 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. That will be difficult! I read the incom ing data on dem and and pr oduction as generally consistent with a slowdown to about trend growth in the second quarter but not at all definitive on whether we are in th e process of a m ore sustained slowdown from  the 4 per cent rate of growth experienced over the las t three y ears. On the inflation front, the last CPI repor t reduced concern that we are already seeing a m ove toward higher inflatio n. But the recent pattern in CPI rep orts is consistent, in my view, with the inte rpretation th at co re inflation has now stabilized and that, therefore, the best inflation news is behind us. Concern that we m ay, in addition, be poised for an uptrend in inflation going forw ard com es mainly from  the labor m arket, where there are som e hints that dem and pre ssures are now beginning to be felt in wage changes. This is the tone of the Beige book. We also have the upward revision to the average hourly earning series and the rebound in the 3- and 6-month rates of increase in average hou rly earnings in th e last se veral m onths rela tive to the 12-m onth increase, following a period of deceleration. On top of this are report s of higher health insurance costs that are expected to boost the empl oyer benefits com ponent of the ECI going forward. The change in the Greenbook forecast, wh ile not dram atic, certainly is in the direction of supporting the case for a higher federal funds rate  target. While I thought the 6/29-30/99 58 rhetoric of the Greenbo ok was m odified som ewhat more than the forecas t, I appreciated both changes. The 0.4 percenta ge point increase in core CPI in 2000 relative to 1999, the 2.7 percent core CPI inflati on rate in the fourth quar ter of 2000, and the mom entum toward still higher inflation thereafter are the central stor ies in the Greenbook. This is consistent w ith m y own concerns. Now, at Humphrey-Hawkins m eetings, the st aff also offers an extended forecast. This puts us in a better position to consider the longer-run path of m onetary policy that is consistent w ith our policy objectives, rather  than focusing exclusively on the decision about the target for the f unds rate between t oday and the next FOMC m eeting. This also provides an opportunity to consid er the inflation risks associat ed with initial conditions in terms of current utilization rates and the prevailing momentum in econom ic growth. Let m e note som e of the im portant features  of th is extended f orecas t. Despite the 50 basis point tightening over the Greenbook horizon and the cum ulative 150 basis point tightening o ver the extended forecast horizon, inflation m oves up m easurably. And the rise in inflation m ay be steep er than it appears on the surface. The reference price index is the PCE, which has been running and is  expected to continue to run about ¾ percen tage p oint be low the CPI. The rise in the P CE inf lation  rate f rom just below 1½ percent this year to just above 2 percent by 2001 and to a peak later of about 2½ percent trans lates in to an increas e in core CPI from  2 per cent over the last 12 m onths to about 2¾ percent in 2001 and a peak of around 3¼ per cent. Add another 0.6 to 0.7 to put this number on a m ethodologically c onsistent basis with a 3.1 pe rcent increase in core CPI over 1995. I think this helps to underscore the point I m ade at the last meeting: That there is a danger that we could squander a m ost extraordinary set of disinf lationary forces over the last several years and allow this epis ode to be a transition to higher rath er than lower inflation. The Greenb ook forecast and m y own, of c ourse, reflect k ey assum ptions about trend growth and NAIRU. Our forecasts hav e adm ittedly b een very poor over the las t few years. There is no question that ther e is an unusual degree of uncertainty on all counts. But the reasonable possibility of a signi ficant rise in inflation is a concern that I will weigh in m y monetary policy p osition tom orrow m orning. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 6/29-30/99 59 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. We’re being increasingly admonished to fight inflation and not real gr owth. I wish it were that sim ple. Everybody loves growth. It im proves living standards and a consonant growth in overall liquidity keeps inflation low. But even though growth is desirable, a nation can have too m uch of a good thing. If there is little econom ic slack as m easured, say, by unemploym ent and discourag ed workers, an d if there are lags in m onetary policy, the m ain way the Fed can contro l inflation is to co ntrol g rowth --tha t is, to keep the prospective growth in aggregate demand close to that of aggregate supply. To m ake a judgm ent of whether it is  close, we must rely on forecas ts. Even with an upward s hift in produ ctivity grow th, a re asonable forecas t for growth in aggregate supply over the next few  years is around 3 perc ent, perhaps a bit above. A forecast for demand growth is harder to com e by, and the st aff’s has certainly not been perfect. But the staff has learned from its m isses and has inc orporated th ose lesson s into its n ew forecasts, so  I’m willing to assum e that th ey are n ow probabilistic ally unb iased. The baseline forecast that m any of you referred to does already in clude a h igher federal funds rate. The v ersion th at I p refer of the staff forecasts assum es no change in the funds rate. This shows that the forecast growth in aggregate dem and is com ing in above that of aggregate supply. Even including the flat Y2K quarter, the av erage g rowth in real aggregate dem and in the unchanged funds rate v ersion of the forecast is 3. 3 percen t over the next year-and-a-half; taking out this flat quarter, it rises to 3.8 percent. The true estim ate is probably som ewhere in between the two. This is not a huge supply/dem and imbalance, but I think there is  som e imbalance. Since the forecast b egins at a tim e when  resources  are tight, fo recas t infla tion gradually accelerates by about  ½ point per year in 2000 as opposed to 1999, with m ore acceleration in later years. Roughly the sam e pattern is shown  in the Blue Chip forecast. This acceleration has been a stand ard, though la rgely unrealized, feature of the forecast for som e time now. I’ve always been worried about it, bu t I’m getting a little m ore so lately for five reasons. One is that th e long-awaited natural slowdown in the U.S. econom y seems not to have m aterialized. Second, the world econom y is beginning to recover. Third, comm odity prices have stopped dropping and m ay even be  turning up. Fourth, there are now more tight labor m arket anecdotes than before in the Beigebook 6/29-30/99 60 and elsewhe re. Fifth, th ere a re early if inte rmittent signs of a ccele ration in prices and even a touch in wages. After a long spell, it may now be time to worry about the gradual acceleration of inflation and to think about tightening policy. The sam e suggestion is given by targeti ng rules. A forward-looking inflation targeting rule would tell us to tighten. A forward-looking no minal income targeting rule would tell us to tighten. If the real inte rest rate is in the neighborhood of 3.8 percent, which is taken from  the possibly biased TIP market, the nom inal funds rate is probably too low from a long-term standpoint. None of  these indicators is perfect, but all are starting to p oint in the s ame directio n. Let m e step ahead and talk about the “tap  on the brakes” issue.  Should there be a slight tap on the brakes or a stronger tap?  The argum ent for a slight tap is that there is still a g reat deal of  forecasting un certainty in all of this and there is still tim e to m ake future chang es if new data conf irm our suspic ions.  Until we se e the whites of  the eyes o f inflation, prem ature Fed m oves do not let the new high productivity  American economy reach its full potential. The argum ents for a stron ger tap are that the p resent funds rate that there ar e lags bo th in m onetary policy and in the inflation process. In being too cautious and not taking advantage of window s of opportunity, delayed Fed m oves let inflation heat up again after ye ars of painful sacrifice to br ing it under control. I’m not going to say where I am  on this except to say that thes e were years of painful sacrific e. [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mr. Madigan, you have the floor. 

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN. This briefing provides background for your review of the ranges for money and debt for 1999 a nd your decision regarding provisional ranges for 2000. I’ll be referring to the charts and tables from the Bluebook that have been distributed separately to you this m orning in a pack age labe led “Staf f Presentation on Money and Debt Ranges.” 3/ Last February, the FOMC reaffirm ed the growth ranges for 1999 that were chosen provisionally one year ago: 1 to 5 percent for M2, 2 to 6 percent for M3, and 3 to 7 percent for dom estic nonfinancial sector debt, shown in Chart 1. The Hum phrey-Hawkins report in February noted th e FOMC’s c ontinued uncertainty regarding appropriate rates of  money growth in the inte rmediate term  and stated that the Committee in tended the m onetary ranges to be benchm arks for growth under conditions of price stability, sustai nable econom ic growt h, and historical velocity relationships. In addition, th e report pointed out that the m onetary aggregates could exceed their ranges during 1999. As shown in the top panel of the chart, M2 has indeed been running above its range so far this year, with growth through June at a 6¼ percent annual rate. M3 growth for the year to date has been about 6 percent at an annual rate, just at the top of its range. Debt, by contrast, has been com fortably within its range. The relatively rapid expansion of M2 this ye ar im portan tly reflects the brisk pace of nom inal incom e growt h. In addition, it has m irrored a further degree, the decline in V 2 over the first ha lf of this year probably was a lagged response to the drop in opportunity cost-- the dashed line in the upper panel--late in 1998 following the easings of m onetary policy. In the m iddle panel, the lower solid line, labeled “Fit  from  1959:Q2 to 1989:Q4,” shows the historical association between opportuni ty cost--the horizontal ax is--and V2, the vertical axis. Points corresponding to the ex perience over the period since m id-1994 are shown in the box and are repeated in m agnified form  in the lower panel. That scatterplot suggests th at the dem and for M2 m ay reta in an interest sensitivity somewhat sim ilar to that apparen t in earlier d ecades. Since its peak in m id-1997, however, V2 has dropped considerably while this m easure of opportunity cost has change d little on net. We can’t pin down the reasons for the downtrend, but it seem s reas onable to suspect that wealth m ay be playing a role. Large stock m arket gain s have boosted wealth but have left portfolios skewed toward equities. As investors, in response, have diversified some of their wealth into other assets, such as deposits and m oney fund shares, 3 / A cop y of the material u sed by Mr. M adigan is app ended to the t ranscript. (Appendix  3) 6/29-30/99 62 M2 has been growing m ore quickly th an nom inal incom e. Nonetheless, econom etric studies have not identified a cl ear role for wealth in M2 dem and, and considerable uncertainty continues to surround the determ inants of M2. Chart 3 shows the velocity of M3 in  the upper panel and the velocity of debt in the lower panel. In 1999 V3 has continued to drop at a pace a bit quicker than its trend from  1960 to 1985. The velo city of debt has rem ained roughly flat, as was the case before the m id-1980s. Table 1 summ arizes the staff projec tions for 1999 and 2000. As shown in the third colum n, M2 is projected to expand 6 percent over 1999, outpacing the 5¼ percen t gain in nom inal incom e forecast by th e staff in the Greenbook and the similar central tendency of incom e growth in your own forecasts. The projected influences and a sm all boost to M2 dem and from  Y2K concerns. These effects are partly of fset by the assum ed tighteni ng of m onetary policy this year. Next year, M2 growth is expected to slow furt her to 5 percent, owing in part to the well as the Greenbook. A reversal of the Y2K effects and the continued fading of the portfolio effect on m oney dem and, given the proj ected leveling-out of the stock m arket, also contribute to  M2’s expected deceleration. M3, the second line of the third colu mn, is forecast to expan d 6¼ percen t this year. The sharp slowing from  last year’s pace of nearly  11 percen t mainly reflects a steep drop-off in bank credit grow th after the su rge th at resu lted from last year’s market turm oil. Next year , M3 growth is seen as edging off to 6 percen t, with the effects  of the deceleration in M 2 being partly offset by a strengthening in bank funding need s as bank credit picks up som e. Dom estic no nfinancial se ctor debt is projected to expand 5½ percent in 1999 and 4¼ percent next year, about in line w ith nom inal incom e. The contraction in federal debt  steepens, owing to the wi dening budget surplus, while nonfederal debt expands briskly, agai n outpacing nom inal incom e, although it does slow. Table 2, on the following page, shows the two sets of ranges for m oney and debt presented in the Bluebook for Co mmittee consideration. Both sets were developed under the presum ption that the Comm ittee would wish to retain its current, long-run price-stabil ity rationale for the monetary ranges and the current projection rationale fo r the debt range. Under Alter native I, the Comm ittee would keep the existing ranges for 1999. The ranges for M2 and M3 under this  alternative are centered on growth rates that would likely preva il under conditions of price stability and historically typical velocity behavior, with a tren d in poten tial GDP m ore in lin e with perform ance earlier in th is decad e--before the ap parent recen t improvem ents in 6/29-30/99 63 productivity growth. For instance, th e M2 range of 1 to 5 percent under Alternative I would be consistent with pot ential real GDP growth of 2½ percent, the staf f estim ate of ½ percen tage po int bias in inflation m easured using the GDP deflator, no true inflation, a nd flat V2. Under this alterna tive, the sam e monetary ranges presum ably woul d carry over to next year since the underlying assum ptions would be unchanged. By contrast, the m onetary ranges for Alternative II are designed to be consistent w ith an expecta tion that the stronge r productivity gains of the past year or so will p ersist, with implications f or more rap id growth in  potential G DP. The M2 range of 2 to 6 percent could be roughly consistent with potential GDP growth of 3¼ percent, as in the Gree nbook, the staff estim ate of ½ percentage point bias in inflation using the GDP defl ator, near price stab ility, and flat V2. For dom estic nonfinancial sector debt , the Committee has not applied the price -stability rationale b ut instead has selected a range that has been approxim ately centered on its expected grow th. Consistent with this approach, both alternatives propose ranges for de bt that are roughly centered on staff projections. With the staff forecastin g debt growth for this year of 5½ percent, the existing 3 to 7 percent range would still be approxim ately centered on the expected outcom e. Given the staff’s pr ojection of a slowdown in debt growth next year to 4¼ percent, the Comm ittee m ight want to consider reducing the debt range to 2 to 6 percent on a provision al basis for 2000 as proposed in both alternatives. As it happens, such a range would be the sam e as one based on price stability con sideration s under the ass umption of more rapid growth in potential GDP that is the bas is for the Alte rnative II m onetary rang es.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. It strikes m e that we have an interesting d ilemm a, which is m erely a vari ation of the ones we’ve had previously, and that is to try to m aintain a set of  monetary growth ranges that we pe rceiv e as consis tent with price stability. That problem  was easy to deal with when we were talking about stable trend productivity growth; when th at didn’t vary very much it was easily interpretable  into potential GDP and into spe cific m oney ranges. The issu e that h as been raised here, obviously, is an im portant one. If our true evaluation were  that we needed to find the particular set of ranges that is cons istent with price stab ility, the argum ent would have to be that we should raise the ranges. The only problem  I have with doing so is that for som e reason--m ostly luck, I guess--we have m anaged to take this whole issu e off the table com pletely. If we change the targets and we try to explain why, what of necessity is going to com e out in the 6/29-30/99 64 explanation is that we have changed our structural productivity  growth m easure from  1 to 2¼ percent, and that is som ething we have avoided doing. I would be inclined to stay where we  are, but in the Hum phrey-Hawkins testim ony in which this is discussed allude to  the fact--since there wi ll be other elem ents of the Hum phrey-Hawkins re port covering the issu es of productivity and potential--that clearly these are m inimal targets. The la nguage would som ehow suggest that these are not quite right but they’re not that im portant . Were we to change them , we would only be changing them  by a relatively sm all am ount, which would not look all that m uch different on the charts. If you visualize what we’re looking at, it’s really not going to matter that much. All we would be doing if we  change them , as far as I can see, is to open us up to discussing what the staff’s tr end productivity num ber is and then we’d get involved in defending it or not de fending it. I feel like the politician who spends m ost of his tim e trying to avoid having certain questions  asked. This is one of those questions I would just as soon not h ave raised b ecause I thin k there are d ifferences of view am ong the people in this room  and it would serve no useful purpose of which I’m aware to get into this discussion. So, m y personal preference is to stay wh ere we are because I don’t see that m uch has changed since the February m eeting. Obviously, I don’t feel strongly about it because one can’t feel strongly about this [laugh ter]--and we shouldn’t. That’s m y general view and I’d be curious to  get reactions from  everybody else.

MR. BOEHNE. I think your advice and recommendation are right on target. I think we ought to keep this off the table.

As far as discussing it in th e Hum phrey-Hawkins testim ony, a nd perhaps as a way to initiate m ore public dialogue about thes e issues, I would ask th at som e weight be given to the idea that in industries wher e we know productivity gains have been extraordinary--in the computer and communications indus tries, for example--prices are falling, as they should. And the wealth gains to businesses and households are manifested in an increas e in the pu rchasi ng power of m oney because thos e pric es are falling. The idea of price stab ility more br oadly means that we would then accep t more rapid increases in prices in other areas wher e there are no pro ductiv ity gains so that th e average stay s the sam e, and it’s no t clear to m e that that’s op timal. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. That is a very important point. In fact, that’s the issue I raise d last n ight with Eddie George: W hat is a true, st able price level?  In other words, is a s table p rice level one that is  conceivably going down at a m easurable and known rate provided the rate of return on invest ment is stable?  Obviously, price stability per se becom es a m uch more complex question when we get into this technology area. We’re using price stability, as best I can judge, as a general proxy with that caveat in it-­at least I ho pe we are.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Than k you very much. Mr. Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The long-run strategies section of the Bluebook highlighted tw o potential imb alances shaping the U.S. econom ic outlook. One, the dom estic saving/investm ent imbalance and the related current account deficit, has been a continuing concern to policym akers. Although the contras ting cyclical circum stances b etween  the United States and the rest of the world have exacerb ated the current account deficit in recen t years, th e deficit and the saving/investm ent imbalance impor tantly also reflect the pickup in productivity growth here. That pickup has boosted wealth and perm anent incom e, 6/29-30/99 68 encouraging our residents to cut sharpl y their saving out of current incom e; foreigners are willing to supply the added saving needed to fund dom estic investm ent because that investm ent has such  high rates of return. The process is not sustainable: In the Un ited States, saving is so low that th e wealth -to-incom e ratio will b egin to dec line once cap ital gain s abate; abro ad, p ortfolios are becom ing increasingly w eighted toward dollar a ssets. Ther e is little m onetary policy can do to speed the adjustm ent. Tightening policy, for exam ple, would damp income but appreciate the dollar so as to have m odest net effects on the curren t acco unt. The issue f or policym akers is wha t price changes  will be pu t in m otion as this im balance begins to correct itself. Once productivity growth levels out, curren t inco me will begin to catch u p to perm anent incom e; and dom estic saving out of  that c urrent inco me will inc rease, r educing the equilibrium  real interes t rate in the United States and the dollar’s real exchange rate. The latter would help to sustain demand in the U nited States and to  contain the current account deficit. The role of monetary policy, if all goes sm oothly, woul d be to lower the short-term interes t rate, f ollowing the equ ilibrium rate down. However, events do not always go smoothly. There m ay be scope for alternative policies, depending on the way the dollar falls and how forei gn investors react and on cyclical circum stances in th e United States an d foreign countries. Portfolio shifts away from  dollar assets, for exam ple, would call for a firm er monetary policy, as would downward pressure on the dollar from unexp ected strength in foreign econom ies and their in terest ra tes. The second imbalance highlighted in this section of the Bluebook has more imm ediate m onetary policy relevance- -and that is the possible im balance in the labo r markets. Behind the staff for ecast and b aseline extension is a ju dgment that the unemploym ent rate is now about a percentage point be low its sustainable level and that the real federal funds rate  is m ore than a ha lf percentage point below its eq uilibrium  level. Structural productivity growth is projected to rem ain at its recently elevated level of 2¼ pe rcent. However, because productivity growth does  not accelerate further, th e effects of the overstretched labo r market will beg in to be felt. The rise in the n ominal federal funds rate assum ed for  the second half of 1999 only prevents the real  funds rate from  declining over the forecast ho rizon. As a consequence,  the im balance in labor m arkets persists, and inflation continues to accelerate in 2001. The two long-run strategies presen ted in the Bluebook both deal with the econom ic and policy disequilibrium  by ra ising the nom inal federal funds rate 1½ percentage points. If the inc rease is rap id, bef ore inf lation has a chanc e to pick up m uch, the real funds rate rise s quickly and by enough to put significant slack in the econom y, which counteracts the inflation pressures now in train and ultim ately p roduces price stab ility. If the increas e in the nom inal funds rate is spread over three y ears, as in th e bas eline strategy, the pickup in inflation over this period implies that the real funds ra te rises more slowly and only by enough 6/29-30/99 69 to return th e unem ployment ra te to th e NAIRU, c apping PCE inflation at the 2½ percent level. Revisions to the assum ed NAIRU and to potential GDP growth have been unusually large in recen t years, respo nding in  part to overpro jections of inflation. This experience suggests that uncertainty about the specificat ions of the supply side of the econom y in the staff forecast a nd its extension might be qu ite sizab le. The studies you received by Orphanides a nd by Orphanides, Porter, Reifschneider and Tetlow highligh ted the exten t to whic h estimates of potential, and hence the gap between actual and potentia l output, have been revise d over the y ears. They also addressed the influence on appropriate  monetary policy of uncertainty about the m easurem ent of potential. They conc luded that, becau se reacting ap preciably to mismeasured outpu t gaps will tend  to add to va riations in b oth output a nd in inflation, faced with such uncertain ty you should reduce your response to estim ated output gaps, w ith the reducti on increasing m ore th an in proportion to the degree of uncertainty. As the author s note, th e Comm ittee in fact app ears to have been doing this in the past two y ears. Except when you are extraordinarily uncertain, however, the estim ated gap shoul d receive som e weight in your policy deliberations. One alternativ e in response to uncertainty is not giving the level of the gap any weight in your policy reactions  and instead paying atten tion on ly to the growth rate of nom inal GDP relative to a targeted growth rate, which reflects a change in the output gap and inflation. This is a risk-averse strategy--very similar to monetary targ eting when velo city is w ell behaved--which m ay be less than optim al, but would avoid large m istakes if the output gap turns out to be substantially different than perceived when policy decisions are being made. This research suggests that in a s ituation where the Comm ittee is rather uncertain about the true level of labor resource utilization, it m ight attach the highest priority to seek ing growth in the econom y that would m aintain the prevailing level of labor util ization u nless ev idence begins to accum ulate that th is level of utilization is inappropriate. To put this in practice in the cu rrent situation, the Comm ittee would want to se t its p olicy stance to provid e some assuran ce that labor m arkets will not be come tauter,  but not nec essarily to s eek som e easing of labor m arket pressur es. Under this c autious appr oach, however, if  the Co mmittee began to see signs that cost and price pr essures were em erging, tending to confirm suspicions that the econom y was producing beyond its potential,  it would want to react prom ptly and decisively. The Comm ittee would need to m ake the determ ination of how m uch tightening is needed to bring the growth  of aggregate dem and back down in line with the expansion of aggregate supply. In this regard, is taking back the 75 basis points cum ulative easing of last fall necessarily a good benchm ark for policy going forward?  To be sure, the m arket disruptions and tightening credit conditions that the easier policy was designe d to offset have largely abated, and the real funds rate rem ains lower than it was last summer despite only m odest net changes in unem ploym ent and inflation rates since then. Moreover, when the 6/29-30/99 70 Comm ittee eased, it was m otivated in pa rt not by the m ost likely econom ic forecast, bu t rather by th e percep tion that the risk s to that forecast were seriously skewed toward the possibility of m ajor disruptions in global fi nancial m arkets and foreign econom ies. The evening out of the distribution of those risks, without any other change in the forecast, would argue for som e firming of policy. Finally, a reluctance to reverse course now, when  market conditions have im proved and labor m arket im balances threaten, m ight m ake the Comm ittee m ore hesitant in responding to rapid ly deteriorating econom ic or financial cond itions in th e future. So, changing circum stances since th e Comm ittee last eased do provide a rationale for tightening, othe r things equal. But much  has changed since last summer, with com plex implications for the inflation outlook. Notably, even m ore rapid productivity growth has held in flation down despite a robust econom y, and in financial m arkets credit cond itions and bond yields are h igher, while o n the other side equity prices ha ve risen as well. Moreover,  the real funds rate last summer was not necess arily at its optim al leve l. Just as in 198 8, the degree of any eventual firm ing should not be keyed to  the size of the previous easing, but presum ably would depend on the econo mic situ ation and th e Comm ittee’s objectives--and could be m ore or less than 75 basis points. In the staff forecast, a fairly m odest firm ing of the  federal funds rate--50 basis points over the second half of the year --is sufficient to slow growth to a bit below the rate of growth in  potential output, at least for a while. If it turns out that g rowth in potential o utput is h igher becau se productivity continues to accelerate, real GDP need not m oderate so m uch to stab ilize labor utilization. But that m ore vigorous prod uctiv ity perfor mance will also likely induce s tronger demand growth than projected by the sta ff as profits and equity prices are boosted. In that circum stance, som e further policy firm ing may still be necessary to keep labor m arkets from  tightening. Data becom ing available since the la st meeting do not suggest an econom y or inflation process gathering the sort of steam  that would require a sizable backup in rates to contain. In fact, ec onom ic expansion is estim ated to have slowed in th e second qu arter to ar ound the pace of its poten tial. Though compensation trends m ay be a bit less fa vorable than expected, 12-m onth changes in average hourly earnings rem ain damp ed and CPI inflation is probably a little lower than m any on the  Comm ittee had fear ed at the last m eeting. Financial flows also do not suggest an accelerating pace of spending. Money growth seem s to be on a slightly slower track in recent  months, even after allowing for the give-back of the surge of late last year, and credit growth continues to average in the neighborhoo d of 6 percent. Moreov er, the recen t growth ra tes of aggregate demand and of m oney and credit do not refl ect the backup in interest rates of the last two m onths, which is too recen t to have had much effect yet. Still, the signs of slowing are tentat ive, and, if labor m arkets are in the process of tightening further, the longer the slowing is delayed, the m ore cost and 6/29-30/99 71 price pressures will build. Under these circum stances, th e substantial easing of financial conditions that would follow a deci sion not to validate at least the first policy -firming step already built into  markets cou ld be counterproductive. Hence, even a cautious approach to preem ptive policy might suggest a 25 basis point incre ase in the f ederal f unds rate to a ssure better that aggregate dem and wi ll rise no faster than aggregate supply. In addition to its decision about the stance of policy imm ediately after the meeting, the Comm ittee also needs to cons ider its posture go ing forward. Such deliberations have always played a role at your m eetings, but their im portance has been heightened by the C ommittee’s polic y of giving a public rationale for its action and by the option to announce change s in the tilt of the directive. Beyond the action you choose today, th ere are three m echanism s available to convey your message to financial m arkets: the wording of the accom panying announcem ent, the tilt to th e direc tive, a nd the tone  of Chairm an Greenspan’ s Hum phrey-Hawkins testim ony in three weeks. How you m ix and m atch from  these possibilities will im portantly shape how m arkets react to your direct actio n and to the data releases and oth er even ts in the weeks th at follow. If the Committee were co ncerned that a cautious a pproach to p olicy firming posed unnecessary risks that in flation would end up higher than was consistent w ith the good perform ance of the econom y, it m ight see, and want to indicate, the possibility of an appreciable increase in th e federal funds rate. An exam ple is the price stability  alternative and the incor porated 150 basis points of tightening in relatively shor t order. Even if the Co mmittee were not intent on conducting policy over com ing quarters to ach ieve literal price stability, it m ight have doubts that a less aggre ssive policy, as in the base line, would serve even to cap the rise in inflation at a reason able rate. These concerns would be heightened if the Committee were sk eptic al that the growth of  aggrega te demand would slow as in th e staf f forecast because, for ex ample, such a slowdown depends on a leveling out of equity prices. Furthe rmore, the Comm ittee may have sufficien t confidence that a 4¼ pe rcent unem ploym ent rate is unsustain ably low tha t it wishes to take strong, prom pt actions to ease pressures in the labor m arkets before inflation begins to pick up. In these circum stances, the Comm ittee might want to consider a 50 basis point increase in the intended federal f unds rate, or a 25 basi s point rise today with the strong presum ption of a like rise within a few m onths . Such sentim ents would be accurately reflected in an asymmetrical directive an d perhaps in heightened inflation concerns expresse d in the associated announcem ent and testim ony. Any backup in rate s this com bination would cau se would contribute to achieving the Comm ittee’s objective, given its view of the need for forceful action to contain inflation. The choice of  the tilt in the directive  is les s clear -cut if  the Comm ittee were to take a m ore m easured approach to preemptive action in light of aggregate 6/29-30/99 72 supply uncertainties. The Comm ittee m ight still suspect that another tigh tening will be need ed this y ear just to align the growth o f demand wi th that of supply, as in the staff forecast. A reasonably str ong presum ption in this direction, an d a sense that su ch a tigh tening is a real p ossibility in the next few  months m ight lead the Comm ittee to adop t an asymm etrical directive. The asymm etry would not come as a surprise to m arket partic ipants, who would exam ine the announcem ent especially carefully for indications of whether your asymm etry extended beyond the next firm ing. But if  the Comm ittee sa w that next action as som ewhat uncertain--quite dependent on incom ing data and not a pr ecursor to a m ore extended series of firmings absent m ore concrete evidence of stronger oncom ing inflation--it m ight want to adopt an untilted directive. Such  a directive m ight also have some appeal because, by reducing the sense that action wa s imm inent, it might help to forestall a market dynam ic that risked building in  stronger expectations of near-term firming than the Comm ittee found comfor table. It would not preclude the Comm ittee’s giving its views that  it continued to need to be especially w ary of the potential for increasing infl ation. And the expression of  such concerns in the announcem ent and reinforced in the Chairm an’s testim ony would help to lim it any m arket rally that ten ded to em erge from  moving to a balanced directive. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions for Don? 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Could I ask about the change in the saving rate and the equilibrium  interest rate that  you talked about in the earlie r portion of your rem arks? Your comments seem ed to im ply that you do not  perceive the current saving rate as the ultim ate equ ilibrium  rate and that yo u believ e saving is go ing to m ove back toward the equilibrium  rate. I’m wondering if that’s really true. As I look at the extended simulations--and I can’t be sure of the data that  I have--that’s not the story I see. To me the sto ry in the extended sim ulations is tha t we have a decline in the wealth-to-incom e ratio and tha t the de cline in tha t ratio leads to  the readjustm ent of the saving rate. So it’s really a question of whether th e equity market is in equili brium today. If the equity change in the saving rate. Is that what’s going on? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think it’s a ll part of the sam e phenom enon. The wealth-to-incom e ratio declines for a couple of reasons. One is  that equity prices don’t rise so rapidly relative to c urrent inco me. There is a proje cted flatten ing out in th e nex t two years, as you know, and very m odest increases thereafter in the equity wealth-t o-incom e ratio. But it’s m ore than that because it’s not only the be havior of the stock m arket, it’s the fact that 6/29-30/99 73 people are not saving enough out of current in come. We, the residents of the United States, are not buying enough of this wealth th at’s being created to keep our wealth-to-incom e ratio  from falling at the curr ent saving ra te. So I think what happens here is that in a sense the growth in produc tivity levels out and this helps to level out the stock It also brings current incom e up to pe rmanent incom e. All those things work togethe r to raise cu rrent saving out of incom e. So, the flattening of the stock m arket, the leveling out of the growth rate of perm anent incom e, the catch-up of the growth rate of current incom e, and the increase in the savi ng rate are all a part of the sam e phenom enon, which is basically the leveling out in the growth of  productivity. I think one could look at it either way: That th e wealth -to-income ratio  is falling and that’s why people save m ore, or that the w ealth -to-income ratio is falling in  part because peo ple sa ve so little and that induces them to increase their saving. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. What about the equilibr ium interest rate?  We had som e discussions previously about th e role of the increase in the productivity trend in raising the equilib rium  real in terest rate. It levels out but at a higher level. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Right. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. How do we sort that out  in term s of what happens to the equilibrium  rate when all is said and done? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Well, when all is  said and done, it ought to be  at a higher rate than it was four years ago. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Okay. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. But it ought to be at a lower rate than it is cur rently giv en the low rate of saving out of incom e and a ve ry rapi d rate of investm ent. As productivity growth levels out, investm ent tends also to level out. So the equilib rium  interes t rate shou ld be lower later than it is now a nd on a downtrend as saving pick s up, but at a level that’s higher than it m ight have been 5 or 10 years ago.

MR. MEYER. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Don, I am going to try to  ask this question clearly. In the Bluebook and in your comments you touched on a couple of issues. One was whether we 6/29-30/99 74 need to m ove 50 basis points over the course  of this year and then how we m ight go forward f rom there. My question is : If one wer e to assum e for the m oment tha t we will need to m ove 50 basis points, what is the best way to go about that?  If we say 25 basis points now, assum ing we m ove at all, that would  crea te unce rtainties rega rdless of  the tilt of the directive we adopt. A symm etric directive would give a false sense to the m arket and to Ma in Stree t that we’re s atisfied with that 25 basis points, and things would begin artificially moving forward agai n. If we say 25 basis points, asymm etric, that would raise uncertainty as to how much and when the next  move will be. If we say 50 basis poin ts, symmetric--suggesting that is sufficient at  least for now--would that create m ore disruption b ecause it’s larger than th e market e xpects ? Or w ould that settle the m arket in the sense of saying, “This is what  we’re doing and it’s enough”? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. If you were confident that you needed to m ove 50 basis points and it wasn’t really dependent on the incom ing da ta over the next couple of months, I don’t think there would be anything gained by doing 25 now and waiting to do 25 later. So, in the case where you were confident that you need ed to do 50 and didn’t want to see m ore data, then you ought to do 50 and announce symme try. I think initially the m arket would be very surprised and there would be a reaction. Depending on the announcem ent, the clear in the announcem ent that this is it for a wh ile, as the ECB tried to do. I think those announcem ents are tricky. You don’t ever wa nt to tie your hands for very long after you’ve m ade a m ove. You don’t know what’s com ing next. The sort of in-between s ituation is th e one where you’re fairly confident you need to do 25 now and you’re not that confident about the next 25. If you’re reasonably confident about the next 25 and see its like lihood as pretty high--it would take som e unusual data to dissuade you a nd you’re planning on doing the a dditional 25 at the next meeting or the m eeting after that--I think asymmetry would accurately represent your views. The m arket would get wound up and build that tightening i n, at least after its experience during the last interm eeting peri od, especially if its expectations were confirm ed at this m eetin g. And that would be okay because in this in -between situation you actually do intend to do that next 25. But if you were less certain--if you thought the next 25 m ight be necessary but you weren’t su re when, and if it were highly dependent 6/29-30/99 75 on the inform ation you’d be getting over the next couple of mont hs--then you m ight be concerned that doing 25 plus putting in the asymm etry would end up creating expectations of a further move . You would com e to the Augu st or October m eeting with these high expectations em bedded in the m arket but you m ight not want to m ove and you’d have given the m arket a fa lse signal. The other option I tried to put on the table is that of going to symm etry and trying to calm  things down a little--not creating strong expectations of a m ove at the next meeti ng. But in addition you could indicate in the announcem ent and in the Hum phrey-Hawkins  testim ony that your m ajor concern was still on the side that inflation pressures m ight be building and you m ight need to m ove. You just weren’t so sure about that and, therefore, you didn’t put  in the asymm etry. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Don, I have a question about the long-term  simulations. Both of them  indicate that ther e is a lot to do in te rms of policy in the next year or two to reach our objectives. Since obviously we don’t ha ve m uch detail here, I was interested in hearing you r views on th e impacts of the altern ative sim ulatio ns relativ e to where we are today on such things as the stock m arket, th e bond m arket, the fore ign exchange m arket, and other vulnerable econom ies in the world. It seems to m e that with the kind of policy changes ind icated in eith er of those alternatives, but particularly in the pr ice stab ility o ne, those im pacts could be very significant. My experience would be that a long-run simulation isn’t going to pick up m uch of that . The other point, som ewhat on the other side, is that if we m oved accord ing to  the pri ce stability altern ative,  it’s con ceivab le that we could see the sacrifice ratio chan ge as well b ecause su ch a m ove would be a very dram atic indication of our resolve with rega rd to monetary po licy. As you put these simulations together, did those ki nds of considerations com e up? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Let m e take the se cond  one f irst. We have built in a m arket learn ing pro cess in the p rice stability alternative. The public, not just the m arkets but businesses and households, learn ab out this over about two years. So in som e sense the actual goal is phased in and then the m arkets’ learning about it is phased in. We smooth that through,  but it is th ere. So whatev er the Comm ittee is targeting, m arkets and households do perceive it. It jus t gets built in gradually. The gra dual adju stment of the 6/29-30/99 76 funds rate differs from  an even sharper increas e in the funds rate in the near term  that would be indicated by the Taylor rule. So the re is total c redibility here. It happens over a couple of years, but it’s bu ilt into the forecast. Unlike the old  MPS m odel, which was totally backward-looking, this  has forward-looking expect ations and the credibility effects get b uilt in. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I see. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. It obviously includes effects on exchange rates and the stock m arket and that sort of thing. But what it doesn’t include is som e nonlinearity, shall we say. It doesn’t take into account som e unusual re actions that m ight occur becau se foreign econom ies, say, or even dom estic financial m arkets are unusually ner vous or unsettled at this point and m ight be more subject than th ey have been historically to a very sharp, sudden m ove in Federal Reserve policy. Basically this builds in how all these m arkets have reacted on average over tim e. We did not  deviate from that. We did not in our simulations take account of the fact that the current state of the world m ay not be equal to the average over history and th at reactions m ight be very m uch stronger in certain situa tions. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Okay, thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. Don, the di scussion about wealth, perm anent incom e, measures of incom e and savings and all that in a dom estic contex t is certainly very im portant. We’re seeing m ore focus not on the creation of wea lth but on the sharing of the wealth in a dom estic con text. We saw in the Chairm an’s JEC testimony recently some questions related to that--for exam ple, is everybody participating equally?  These are im portan t comm ents, politica lly driven im portant comm ents. When the contex t is broadened to the global econom y, the issues becom e much more com plex in that the United States has been creating a great deal of wealth in recent years. We have our own interests abo ut shar ing th e wealth and  the dis tribution of  income. But in a g lobal con text, in most of the places where we look at wealth and m easure it we woul d say that they have been destroying wealth. The effect of the destruction has been m ost severe on those w ith lower incom es--Latin A merica, Asia, and so  on--worsening their in come distribution. 6/29-30/99 77 Now, suppose the rest of  the world, not only the old industrial world of Europe but Asia and  Latin Am erica, s tarts to get its act together a bit, or m aybe a lot--wheth er that involves the enforcem ent of property  rights, tax reform , tax reduction, or deregulation--and they st art getting the keys ri ght to create wealth. Suppose they also address som e of their other problems about th e distribution and sharing of that wealth. Under circu mstances where th e rest of the wo rld finally starts to perform well, what implications do you see for the United States? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. This is sim ilar, in m y mind, to what Karen was showing in the Chart Show yesterday--that is, the po ssibility of  a portf olio sh ift in which dolla r asse ts becom e less attractive relative to foreign assets, no t becaus e dollar assets are less attractive bu t because foreign assets are m ore attractive. From your perspective on the Comm ittee, this m ight tend to accen tuate any dec line in the d ollar. It wo uld look like a portf olio sh ift against th e dolla r. In fact, it w ould be a shift in favor of foreign assets, but it would be a relativ e portfolio sh ift. It would put downward pressure on the dollar. And perhaps even in this very benign scenario  of rising saving and downward pressure on equilibrium  interest rates in the United States it w ould m ean that you would need to have a less m arked easing of policy as things co rrected, or even a tightening of policy. Obviously from  a global perspective this would be a positive developm ent for the world. But it would m ean that the United Stat es would stand out less from the rest of  the world than it has over the last few years. And I think portfolio pref erences would shift as a consequen ce, and that would have an im plication on our forecas t--perh aps, as I s ay, accelerating the downward m ovem ent of the dollar. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Don, I think we all feel th at probably the m ost im portant thing this Comm ittee has go ing for it is ou r cred ibility,  the cr edibility of  the Chairm an. I was wondering about the effects on our credibi lity if we took the last op tion that you presented--if we went up 25 basis points and re turned to symm etry--but soon felt that we had to raise rates further. If the inflat ion num bers in the com ing m onths start to deteriorate and we feel that we have to in crease rates, we would be doing so from  a symmetrical directive not an  asymm etrical one. Are you concerned at all that a 6/29-30/99 78 symmetrical directive w ould affect our cred ibility in the m arketplace when right now they’r e assu ming that we will hav e more than o ne incr ease this year ? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. President Moskow, I don’t th ink I am  concerned if your concerns and your outlook are accurately expressed in the announcem ent and the C hairm an’s testim ony. That is, you could m ove to symm etry but still express the view that the m ajor developm ent you’re m ost concerned about th at would threaten the good perform ance of the U.S. econom y would be a pickup in infl ation. You would indi cate th at you will be especially alert for that, but  you don’t have enough confidence that such a pickup is coming along to be able to say there’s a high pr obability of moving at the next m eeting or the m eeting there after, w hich re taining asymm etry might im ply. So I don’t see a credibility problem  with going to symmetry, provided the accom panying explanations express your concerns. There’s nothing a bout symmetry that m eans you c an’t m ove if the inform ation that comes in suggests th at you need to m ove. The Comm ittee has frequently taken policy actions from  symmetrical directives. If the m arkets are surpris ed, so be it. The m ost important thing you do, obviously, is to make m onetary policy. That you can prepare th e markets and be accurate for ecasters and tell them  where th e risks are coming from is a nice b onus. If you’re right, th at will h elp markets react in a stab ilizin g way consistent with you r conce rns. It’s qu ite possible tha t you will expe ct one th ing and something else will happen, but you could st ill react. I don’t see symm etry and then action from  symmetry as doing anything to th e Federal Res erve’s credib ility, assum ing the Comm ittee gave an h onest and full exp lanation of its assessm ent of the  risks. And perhaps th e nuances inv olved in that assessm ent could be conveyed better in that way than through the symm etry/asymm etry on/off switch. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . You obviously do n’t feel th at the very s trong reac tion to the tilt announcem ent at the last m eeting changes the hi storical view of how  people look at our making a move from  symmetry. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. My concern actually w ould be the other way. After you announced your tilted directive, a lot of observers noted that it had had very little m eaning in the past--that only a sm all proportion of such dire ctives had actually le d to a tightening. But somehow that tilt pu t the spotligh t on the Feder al Reserve. And the in teraction of  that asymm etry and the statem ents com ing from  the Federal Reserve built in a m uch stronger 6/29-30/99 79 presum ption of tightening th an I think m ost of the Comm ittee m embers had in m ind when you made that m ove in May. So in  som e sense your concern m ight be that announcing an asymm etrical dir ective would provoke a m arket reaction that would not be consistent w ith how you plan to approach your next couple of m eetings. I think an announcem ent of asymmetry has a problem  also in term s of potentially m isleading the 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. May I ask a follow-up question on that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Go ahead. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Maybe this question is for Peter Fishe r since it h as to d o with the balanced ? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. My view is that you can give a sense that the risks are not balanced, but they’re just not so unbalanced that you see a high probability of action at the next meeting. Yes, we’re slicing the baloney very thin here! [Laughter] I think the Comm ittee is in a very difficult position. The a ttention on its statem ents has becom e very intens e; each word is ex amined. It’s very, very h ard to conv ey accurately the subtleties of a position  where future actions are highly data-dependent. Yes, you think the next action is m ore likely to be a tightening than an easing, but you’re not sure when. That’s the inform ation the m arkets are look ing for and that’s the sor t of thing that used to be conveyed in the m inutes and the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. That is now conveyed in the announcem ents and the publication of th e symmetries, but you have less opportunity to explain th e nuances --to say on the one hand or on the other hand. So the Comm ittee is in a difficult position. It is a position, I guess, in which you m ight argue that neither symmetry nor asymm etry, as the m arkets potenti ally se e it, ac curate ly represents your perspective. Given the potential reactions to the announcem ents, th e question is how to walk through that m inefield, how to l east m islead  market participants. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH. Don, even though in the 1994-1995 period we didn’t an nounce a tilt until after the followi ng meeting, do  I rem ember correctly th at we did seven consecutiv e firm ing moves and th at each and every one of them  was from a symmetric d irective? 6/29-30/99 80 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I know that we went to  symmetry after each m ove. I’m not sure of the subsequ ent moves because they weren’t at every m eeting. Sometimes we skipped a meeting. I don’t know. Norm Bernard, do you know whether the subsequent m oves were from  a symmetric directive? I know  that every tightening was accompanied by a shift to sym metry but I’m not sure whether th ere was a shif t to asymm etry in th e inte rim. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. And the world didn’t think that we had stopped being a responsible central bank just be cause we went to a symmetric directive? That’s a question! 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I guess not! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER( ?). That’s a good answer. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Don, do you believe that the markets in the future will view a change in symmetry as a change in policy? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I’d say they would view a change from  a symmetrical to an asymm etrical directive as  being a s trong for ecast of the next move. I guess one concern would be th at they m ight com e to interpre t it as a stronger forecast than th e Comm ittee intended. Now, this m ay com e out of the Comm ittee’s atte mpt to retain  as a policy choice the option of asymmetry that wouldn’t necessarily be published. In the process of explaining the Comm ittee’s policy on announcing tilts in the directive, w e said the Comm ittee would only publish strong asymm etries. The m arkets perhaps reacted to that, which m ay have m ade it worse. Peter Fisher ’s chart yesterday I thought was revealing. Bond rates actually went down in the week after the asymm etry was published. So the publication of the asymm etry pe r se didn’t build in this tig htening. I don’t have a fed funds futures table in front of  me, but m y memory is that those futures m oved a couple of basis points--3, 4, or 5 basis points on the publ ication--but didn’t do m uch thereafter, or subsequent events to build this tightening in ; it put more atte ntion on th e statem ents of the Chairm an and other Comm ittee m embers and then that b uilt in the tightening. Now, what we don’t kn ow is what the m arkets will read fro m this las t interm eeting period if, in f act, the Committee tightens to day. We don’t know whether they’ll say: “See, we were  right; you published asymmetry and then you tightened.” If 6/29-30/99 81 there were a couple of instances where you went to asymm etric directives, published those asym metric directives and didn’t tight en, I think the market over tim e would learn that a symm etry isn ’t necessarily a s erious in dication of an imm inent policy m ove. But you would have to be willing to live with m arkets building  in som ething, then tak ing it out, which isn’t awful if you want to retain the asymm etry as a softer indication of the balance of risks. But I th ink it would involve a learni ng process for the m arkets. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Any fu rther questions for Don? 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. I have just one quick question and perhaps I should direct it to Pete r Fish er. Peter, is there any activ e discussion--and if so, to what degree--that move itself at this m eeting?  How much  explicit discussion is there of that? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I think a great deal of  the m arkets’ attention over the last couple of weeks has n ot been on h ow m any basis poin ts the Fed will m ove at th is meeting but on what the wording of the announcem ent will b e and whether th ere will be s ymmetry. Our traders have responded to foreign central banks  wanting to know th e rules this Committee follows in deciding whether to say som ething about symm etry or not. The whole world is really interested in the second part of the announcem ent 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. That’s what I thought. I just wanted to m ake sure. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. They are interested in the process. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think the more general point , President Broaddus, is that what the world is r eally interes ted in is th e Comm ittee’s views of where it is going from  here. They have the 25 basis points built in. Now th ey want whatever clues they can get about where you are going; the symmetry/asymmetry is  a clue but it m ay not be the only one. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. I’m trying to figure out how to do that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Any further questions for Don?  If not, let m e get started by saying that I think we have to m ove at this m eeting, but before I comm ent on that I would like to bring a m uch broader issue into the disc ussion. The reason is that, at least from  my point of view, that issu e com es to grips with a n umber of  the crucial questions that we have to answer in order to  get an effective policy. We would like to go where the econom y and the financial system  suggest we ought to go, whereas everybody else is looking m erely at where they think we are going irrespective of why. 6/29-30/99 82 At the last m eeting, I thought I saw signs that the surge of cost-cutting and hence productivity  acceleration  were begin ning to crest.  I was m istaken. After a short h iatus of continuous upward revisions of company five -year earnings expectations, the upward revisions resum ed late last year and, if anything, h ave acce lerated. The forecasts this month of five-year cyclically adjusted growth  of expected earnings per sh are for the S &P 500 are a full ½ percentage point higher than la te last fall. I can’t say that I believe the rate of long-term  annual earnings has truly sh ifted up ½ percentage point in so short a time fram e, only that co mpanies are telling secur ity analysts that that is th e case. Some of this rev ision surely ref lects a picku p in projections of  foreign af filiate e arnings in Europe, Japan, and developing As ia where those data have been showing som e strength in the m ost recent quarters, but m ost of the picku p of necessity reflects do mestic earnings. There is little evidence that the explan ation is a change in long-term  price forecasts. Indeed, the f orecasts hav e been holding for quite a long perio d of tim e to the notion that there is no “prici ng power.” Nor is it an upward revision in long-term population growth; that I am  almost certain is true. Further, it proba bly does not reflect a major increa se in th e sha re of prof its rela tive to wages. What we are observing in the earnin gs forecast s eries, as bes t I can judg e from  a disaggregation of these num bers that was car ried out in considerable detail, is the statistical reflection of the anecdotal evidence of  dram atic breakthroughs in inform ation technology and m ost recently the surge of Inte rnet application s. The presentation last week to the board of the Federal Reserve Ba nk of Chicago was one of m any that I have heard in the last several months  on this issue. What I found pa rticularly interesting in the discussion that Mike Moskow organized was the concern going forward of regarding indications that Internet  commerce suddenly appeared to be accelerating.  Very substantial action s were going  to be requ ired on the part of counter the com petition com ing from this very differe nt, lo w-cost dis tribution sys tem. is in the process of m aking a m ajor shift from  its conventional “brick and mortar” stores toward the Inte rnet and related tec hnologies, w ith very profound effects on its employm ent. And while we are acutely aware of the very dram atic changes in productiv ity that have occurred in the manufacturing area as a 6/29-30/99 83 consequence of just-in-tim e inventory m anagem ent and capital flexibility, it is less cle ar how m uch of that has been happening in the distribution sector. But it now seem s, on the basis of a nu mber of very recen t reports, th at we are seeing an accel eratio n of activity in this area that suggests the early developm ent of som e form of critical m ass that will enhance productivity in the di stribution sector over tim e. I am not sure whether the 4 percent a nnual rate of increase in productivity estim ated by the New York Bank for the second quarter is right, but we do have fairly good eviden ce that m anufacturing p roductiv ity in  the second quarter has accelerated q uite significantly from  the most recent trends. Indeed, if we take what we reasonably know about m anufacturing productivity, the num ber in the Greenbook for the second quarter for nonfar m productivity growth im plies th at either nonfinancial, nonm anufacturing corporate productivity growth is down sharply or, as I suspect, noncorporate productivity is negative--or som e combination of both. In short, the possibility that our Greenbook’s second-quarter nonfarm  productivity estim ate is on the low side, given the harder numbers for m anufacturing, is not to be dism issed. So while your 4 percent num ber, President McDonough, was probably grabbed out of the air, m ore or less, it m ay well turn out to be correct. Algebraically, the percentage increase in long-term  expected earnings in the context of a stable long-term  profit-to-wag e relationship is equa l to the sum of the expected inflation, the exp ected percentage rise in aggregate hours or population, depending on the way one m ay want to look at it, plus the expected percentage increase in productiv ity. It is no t likely that th e upwar d revisions in forecast earnin gs since late last year reflect revisions in expected inflation or popul ation growth. And assum ing the earnings of foreign affiliates  are not distorting this pi cture to o much, the im plicit revis ions in earnings forecasts that are bei ng rep orted by bus iness firm s seem ingly reflect the equivalent of a ½ percenta ge point rise over th e past several m onths in the expected trend productivity growth rate. Now, I’m  not saying that they are right. I’m m erely indica ting w hat the b road sum  of anecdota l information f iltering into a la rge num ber of security analysts who are evaluating S&P 500 co mpanies is in effect saying. This raises, in my judgment, som e really im portant questions. 6/29-30/99 84 Our Greenbook forecasters have cho sen to us e the sam e trend growth rate for all quarters of their forecasts. They have always  done that. It’s auto matic. They don’t m ake a distinction from  one quarter to the next even though I woul d suspect that when we look back on this period, we are going to get a nonl inear, or m ore exactly an accelerating, longer-term  growth path as th e only way to fit the data. With the econom etric structure we employ, an unchanging productivity tre nd algebraically requires inflation to accelerate if we have an estim ated NAIRU th at is above the u nemploym ent rate, which we do. If trend productivity is accelerating, however, th e forecast inflation rate can stabilize or even fall. So the implicit forecast of rising inflatio n that we have had in a ll of our discussions this m orning logically requires that the p roductivity grow th rate be s table or at least accelerate only very m odestly. Does the funds rate need to be increased by 50 or 75 basis p oints as is in dicated in th e Greenboo k forecast?  The answer is “yes” if our models capture reality. Obviously, once output per hour stabilizes ev en at a high rate, the acceleration of inflation resum es provided, of  course, that the N AIRU re mains above the unem ployment rate. We have no eviden ce at this s tage of which I am  aware, however, th at ind icates the acceleration in productiv ity ha s ended. All of our experience and courses in Econom etrics 101 induce a visceral  antipathy to such persiste nce in productivity gains, especially for m e since I have the oldest  gut in this room . [La ughter] What is increasingly evident is that som ething seem s to be happening that none of us has ever witnessed before--perhaps a once-in-a-century structural shift in how goods and services are produced. People in the front lines of bus iness operations, such as  Jack W elch of GE and Lou Gerstner of IB M, say this is a true revolution. They have seen nothing like this in their experience. And I venture to say that if we get on the phone with a num ber of business people who have been around a long ti me, we are going to hear this view from all of them . No one is saying that this accum ulative, techno logy-driven p roductiv ity growth is showing any signs of slowing. I would not go that far, but I believe something profound is happening. We are observing m arket capitalizations th at are telli ng us som ething very interesting even as we simultaneously argue that stock m arket pri ces are overvalu ed. We are seeing a very dram atic shif t in the cha nging capita lizations of high-tech versus low-tech com panies. 6/29-30/99 85 But even the low-tech co mpanies are not showing any significant real destruction of market values, though  that’s only because there are no low-tech com panies anym ore. The least efficient types of  steel operations, such as those em ploying blast and oxygen furnaces and  old-fashion ed rolling mills, if th at’s all they were, would lon g since hav e disappeared from  the industrial s cene. But th ey have stripped workers out of rolling m ills at a rate that is unbelievable, and we are left with high-tech steel operations--to the extent that we can have them  with that obs olete stru cture of making steel. I had a conversation with on the question of what will happen to the m arket values of real estate in  malls if indeed we experien ce a sign ificant shift to cyber space types of di stribu tion. In that event, th e commercial bu ildings will no longer hav e the im portan ce that they now have . The one savin g grace in all of this, as I believe I said is that shopping is not a f ully econom ic activity. In fact, m ost people actually seem  to shop for en tertainm ent and other reasons. So, shopping m alls ar e places involving what might in a sen se be viewed as cultural activities. Shopping is what peopl e do. We are not dealing with a wholly econom ic issue. I am not saying that it is appropriate for with their huge real estate investm ents, to be signifi cantly worried. But there is som ething going on in the economy, som ething profoundly im portant , and we don’t know where it is going to lead. The mere fact that so me profound econom ic change occurs every century m ust put us on guard to m ake sure that it doesn’t ha ppen on our watch without  our being aware of it. If it’s rea l, it is c rucially im portan t and very significantly co mplicate s our task in setting m onetary policy. How do we know when an econom y is overhea ting?  We cannot tell from the rate of econom ic growth by itself. Obvio usly, if  outp ut per hour is acce leratin g, so are real incom e and GDP. And if output is accelerati ng, that of necessity ha s to show up in the spending components since the a ccounts m ust balance. Currently, m otor vehicle sales are running well in excess of  past trends. Housing sales are absurdly high. Capital investm ent is strong. So, are we really sa ying that the econo my is overh eating b ecause we are look ing at a 17-p lus m illion annual rate of autom obile sales and n ew hom e sales 6/29-30/99 86 that a re moving up to a 1  million ann ual ra te? That, in and of  itself, says n othing abou t the degree to which this  econom ic system  is overheating. We cannot tell until we loo k at the com bination of aggregate supply and a ggregate dem and. The reduced for m view of all of this is whether or not we have slack  in the product and/or the labor m arkets. If we have a situation in which effec tive dem and exceeds potential supply, then prices rise. If it is the ot her way around, they fall. What we have now is clearly an ambivalent s et of circum stances in th at we  are g etting a very d ramatic acceleration in aggregate dem and but we are not seeing the usua l effect in prices. Or m ore exactly, from the point of view that I think is relevant, we are not seeing it in unit costs. Indeed, the data that we put together, or m ore exactly that Larry Slifm an puts together by extending the inform ation that we get from  the BLS and Comm erce on unit costs in nonfinancial corporations, suggest that for the quarter just ending--and th is is consistent with the Greenbook which, rem ember, I suspect has a lo w productivity estim ate--the change in unit cos ts is effectively zero over the past f our qu arters. Prices are up som ewhat becau se the fourth quarter of 1998. The re ason is not that prices have b een accelerating. It is that unit cost growth rates have been falling. In that regard, when we look at a system  whe re short-term  earnings exp ectations are accelerati ng quite p ronou ncedly--certainly that is the case for the first quarter and also for the second --that is te lling us that p rofit margins are opening up in the context of a d ecline in unit cost growth. This is scarcely an indication that effectiv e dem and is exceeding p otential sup ply at this p articular stage. We certainly don’t see it in term s of product m arket tightness. We don’t see any particular shortages. Where we do have a problem  is in the labor m arkets. If we had a fully balanced system  in which output and dem and were e qual to working age population growth plus trend productivity growth, then  one would presum e that we had a stable system . We don’t have that at the mom ent. We are continuously reduc ing the num ber of people who would like to work but don’t have a job. That number is going down, though it is going down less than it was a year ago when the pool  of available w orkers was shrinking at an annual rate of a m illion people. That num ber is now down to about 500, 000, which is roughly equivalent to ½ percentage point in  potential GDP growt h. In other words, aggregate dem and is currently running in excess of potential gr owth by about that 6/29-30/99 87 amount. And that, as best I can judge, is be ing engendered wholly by a wealth effect. In fact, our estim ate of the wealth effect is greater than that. The point I am  trying to m ake here is th at we have a situat ion that is out of equilibrium . We don’t see it in the price data  currently. What we do see is a situation that, if  it con tinues indef initely, m ust crea te som e problem s in the labor m arket and eventually in unit labor costs and prices. At that point we clearly will be experiencing a real-tim e inflation process. The one thing I find a little puzzling at th is stag e is why the rates of declin e in both the unemployed and the broader category of  job seekers are slowing. One argument obviously could be that we ar e running out of people and are scraping the bottom  of the barrel. But if that were the case, we would see far m ore in the way of anecdotal reports, not to m ention statistical data, on increasing average hourly earnings. It may be that when the data for June com e out on Friday we will s ee a b ig pop, and we will th en be able to say “problem  solved.” But that is by no m eans evident. To be sure, the last Beigebook did show a little m ore evidence of labor m arket pressures. But we do not have clear-cut, unequivocal evid ence at th is stage that the eco nomy is in the process o f accelerating.  If we believe the econo my we  have today is tru ly captured b y the forecasting s tructure in the Greenbo ok and in  the extended p rojection of the Blueboo k, then the po licy issue that Tom  Hoenig rais ed would be up front on the table and in m y judgm ent definitive. My answer to Tom  is that if we belie ve the s taff forecas t, the argum ent for 50 basis points and going symmetric would I thi nk be overwhelm ing at this point. My problem  is that as I see it the structure th at is actually governi ng this econom y is not being properly captu red in the m odels used for the forecasts. I believ e the evidence that we have to date suggests that the 2¼ pe rcent trend productivity  num ber is already obsolete. I suspect we are going to find that to be the case as the year goes on unless the individuals in the business comm unity with whom we intera ct are com pletely m issing the boat. We would not be seeing the profit fi gures and the econom ic growth that we are observing if what all these people are sayi ng is wrong. And we surely would not be seeing declining rates of infla tion in unit costs. Indeed, after this ex tended period of econom ic expansion we would not be seeing a four-quarter average change of zero, or 6/29-30/99 88 actually -0.1, in the un it costs of nonfinancial corporations  and of 0.2 in unit labor costs. This is not the type of econom y that is well captured by the econom etric structure w e have built into our Greenbook forecasts. One only needs to go back and look at the Greenbook forecasts to see that the p rojected trend productivity num ber is higher in each successive Greenbook. I don’t know whether the surge of co st-cutting and the acceleration of productivity have reached a peak. As I said at the beginning, I thought  at the tim e of the last m eeting that there w as som e evidence that that was indeed the cas e. The stabilization that I felt was happening has disappeared a nd productivity has su rged dram atically higher. I do feel uncom fortable with the funds rate at 4¾ percent, an d I think the appropriate thing is to m ove it up to 5 percent if for no othe r reason than to undo part of the 75 bas is point reduction that we p ut in place d uring th e fall. That clearly was a reaction to events which, as Don Kohn just sa id, have changed. There is the longer-term issue of our labor m arkets sti ll being out of equilibrium  even  if we can explain why wage pressures are not as strong as I, at least, th ink they really are. I know our wage-price equations do capture this in part, but I am  frankly  a bit sk eptic al and f earful that a little data m ining is involved in this process. If we are looking at the issue of symm etry versus asymm etry, I don’t think the realistic que stion r elates to the m ost likely direction of the next m ove we are going to make. Unless the economy com es apart unexp ectedly, I th ink the ch ances of our having to move the funds rate lower are close to zer o. The next m ove we are likely to m ake is almost surely up. If that is indeed our expectation, we would have concluded under our past regim e that that calls for asymmetry. But w e are now in a new regim e and those terms no longer m ean what they did in the past. I was startled by the extraordinary though the correction in the fede ral funds rate that actually  occurred was modest. We might as well have raised rates at that point as far as I am  concerned. What I find quite bothersom e is the existence of at least som e evidence, although Don Kohn tells m e it’s somewhat dubious, that a lot of corporate trea surers are allegedly borrow ing ahead for the purpose of beating the F ed to the punch. Indeed, what we are looking at is a long-term 6/29-30/99 89 interest rate that is m oving up becau se market participan ts think the Fed is going to m ove. In the process we are losing our ability to understand what the m arkets are telling us. I am concerned that we are looking in the m irror. What we are endeavoring to do is to evaluate objectively what is going on in the econom y and to  craft m onetary policy to appropriately address w hat we observe. But with our new announcem ent procedure, I am fearful that we m ay inadverten tly ha ve crea ted a situa tion in which f inancial p layers are reacting to what we are doing and in the pr ocess causing the m arkets to run ahead and give us signals that are inappropriate. I believe it was Ned Gram lich who pointed ou t that the federal funds rate is lower at the m oment than the real im plicit long- term rate. I suspect there is a good policy argum ent there, but I’m  not sure that the real lon g-term  rate is  the m arket rate. I think it then get ourselves caught in a bind. I know th at sounds a little peculiar, but I think the way Don Kohn put it is probabl y what we ought to be doing, nam ely to go to form al symmetry. We also would, as we have in the past, suggest that our real concern is the risk of rising inflation. We do have potential imbalances in that direction and very little evidence on the other hand that  our next m ove is going to be to lower rates. So I would suggest, for discussion at least,  that we raise the f unds rate 25 basis points today, go back to for mal symm etry, but include wording in our announcem ent that we have used in the past when we we re goi ng asy mmetric. That’s a longer speech than I had intended to m ake.

MR. KELLEY. Very interesting.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Vice Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Mr. Chai rman, I agree fully with your recomm endation and let m e explain why. In my view there is no question that we should raise the fed funds rate. A failure to do so would create an extrao rdinarily strong reaction in markets; I think the first trade would be  up and I’m  not quite sure where the second trade would be because p eople would  wonde r where Federal Reserve policy was now headed. The issue really becom es the ques tion of the announcem ent and the tilt. I agree with you fully--and as I m entioned yesterday- -that financial m arkets are sim ply not 6/29-30/99 90 functioning in a way that a m arket econom y needs to have them  function. Markets have to have bulls and bears and buye rs and sellers to function effectively. Instead, what we have is people trading of f a new breed of Fe d watchers who are m ore involved in politics and am ateur psychoanalysis than the old Fed watchers who tended to look at all the numbers and variables. This phenom enon, I think, is extrem ely counterproductive and something that we need to m ove against by shifting our approach. I tried to m ake the distinction yesterda y between the philoso phical role of the centr al bank , which is c learly p rice stability  on a symmetric b asis, and the  need in a shorter tim e frame to distingui sh between strategy and tactic s. I believe the interm eeting tilt should b e described as tactical. Since it is not clear when we will have to m ake the next tightening m ove, it seem s to me that tactica l symmetry is appropriate and that is what I believe you recommended. The question is: How do we go about esta blishing what I would describe as strategic asy mmetry, if  the like ly imbalance s in the m arket develop in the direction of requiring further tightening?  I think we have to do that th rough the new vehicle of the statem ent regarding the policy ob jectives of the Federal Reserve that will accom pany our action this afternoon. I also agree that if we we re absolutely certain that we had to increase the f unds rate by 50 basis points, we ought  to do it today and go symmetric. However, I think that would be very, very difficult to m anage. We have had a poor record in th is Comm ittee in trying to giv e a signa l that we have d one so mething and that’ s it; and ce rtainly the re cent experience of the European Central Bank woul d not lead one to believe in such an approach. The last tim e I rem ember our doing that was in August of 1994 and it was a mistake then. I think a lot of us were rather  queasy about what we said then. We should have been b ecause it was the wrong thing to sa y given that we did contin ue to tighten after tha t, and rathe r soon after tha t. In addition to the fact that it would be very difficult to m anage, there are two other reasons why it isn’t altoge ther clear that we need to raise the funds rate another 25 basis points this year. I have a feeling, in one of the older stom ach linings in this room, that the new  once-in-a-century type of pheno menon is actually likely to be happening. But as central bankers, with m onetary policy la gs of one to two years, we don’t need to 6/29-30/99 91 sign up for that view now. All we need to do is have a reasonable degree of confidence that it is lik ely to con tinue for the nex t one to two years. And I think there is every reason to b elieve th at. Lastly, on the issue of labor force tightness: W ithout any question all of the anecdotes th at we hear that m arkets are very tight here and th ere--in fact, in m ost places-­are clearly right. But just as the econom y is changing, I think the labor force and the availability of people in it are changing too. We have within our society fairly large numbers of people who really thought jobs we re not available for th em. We are changing that. The nature of the w ay the economy is behaving, the beneficial effects of what has been-- either by good luck or good guidance or some of each--very effective m onetary policy is m aking it m uch m ore likely for m any pe ople to think  that they  can really have a job. The data on the labor force--data m easuri ng those who might like to be in the labor force-- don’t pick up such people very well. If we can continue to find that difficult-to-define pool and bring these fello w citizens into the labor force,  I think that is a very good thing. We can’t bas e monetary po licy on the hope that that w ill happen; it m ay happen, it the ava ilability of  people  to join the labor force--changes that flow from  the changes in the real econom y. That’s som ething else we have to be aware of. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. First of all, let m e thank you for those extrem ely provocative rem arks. I look forward to working on digesting them  as soon as the transcript is ava ilable to us. But on a much m ore prosaic level, let m e say initially that I strongly su pport your recomm endat ion. I think there are two sets of reasons to be cautious about moving too aggressively right  now. The first revolves around the uncertainties of today’s econom ic situ ation, and in that regard I would m ake a couple of points. This econom y could slow s pontaneously. In fact, it is doing so in the second quarter relative to th e first quarter. If we look at consumption and include housing as a consum ption item , that represents  over 70 percent of GDP. If we throw in capital expenditures, it’s well over 80 percent.  I can think of a num ber of reasons why a great m any of those components could very easily grow m ore slowly. Even if they 6/29-30/99 92 remain at a high level, their ra tes of growth could be substa ntially lower. Just becau se they haven ’t done that so  far doesn’t nece ssarily m ean that th ey can’t or won’t. Secondly, and this is partly what you referred to, Mr. Chairm an, the trends of the recen t past could very easily ex tend for a long tim e. Extre mely strong productiv ity may very well have a long life ahead of it. Infla tion m ay stay quiescent as it has been. If the econom ies of the rest of the world stay som ewhat more sluggish than we are im plicitly thinking, that m ay happen; and it would have a strong im pact. Lastly, we have a stock m arket that is in a very precarious position. It’s very fragile and I think very shock prone. Investors can take their chances, bu t the concern  is that stock market developm ents could ha ve a strong im pact on the real econom y. Another factor in play here --and this harkens back again to your rem arks, Mr. Chairm an, and to the dialogue with Don Kohn a few m inutes ago--is the dynam ic that we more freely. I think our firs t venture out with an announcem ent of our tilt in May really went quite well. The markets seem ed to understand it quite accura tely and accept it for what it was. Why we di d it was interpreted fairly well. Markets m oved. And here we are, we’re moving. It worked okay this tim e around; I think th e reaction was quite responsible. But I think we ought to be careful about being t oo comfortable that this is always going to be the case. This new policy we have now is being watched with unbelievable intensity and apprehension, not ju st by m arket players but also by the m an on the stree t for perhaps the f irst time. My sense is that it is br oadly perceived by W all Street and Main Street that under the old regim e, as they cam e to understand it, these tilts meant very little to them  but tha t under the n ew regime they probably m ean a lot m ore. And they just don’t know  what that m eaning m ight turn out to be. That is a perfect setup, I think, for a very serious m isinterpretation or overreaction on the part of the public. To avoid that, this Comm ittee should be very jud icious and very cautiou s in how we bill this policy and its announcem ent. I fear that if we do m ore than just a 25 basis point tightening today, then we are going to run a wholly unnecessary  risk of losing control of events here and of very possibly creating s ubstantial and un predictable m ischief. Let’s remember, of course, that we can tighten any time we feel it’s necessary; and we can do 6/29-30/99 93 it, and have m any times, from  a symm etric directive. We can so indicate in the announcem ent that we releas e this afternoon. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Greenbook forecast, which is not far from  either the consensus forecas t or m y own, suggests that we will no t be able to stabilize inflation at an acceptab le rate wit hout m ultiple tightening m oves. Given the risk of higher inflation, the 50 basis point tighteni ng this year that is incorporated into the Greenbook forecast would in m y view be prude nt and approp riate. That would m ean doing the 25 basis points today and another 25 ba sis points later in the year, subject to the condition that data in the interim  do not disconfirm the need for a second move. I believe there are few risks of moving in  this direction, given the st rength of the econom y today, initial conditions in term s of labor market tig htness, and our ability to reverse course if necessary. There is, on the ot her hand, considerable risk in doing nothing. This is another example of the m aximin strategy: Consider the worst outcom es under various policy a lternative s and se lect the policy with  the least bad outcom e. Mr. Chairm an, you talked about the possib ility that produ ctivity is still acceleratin g, and that m ight be the case. If it is,  I expect it also m eans that the equilibrium  real interest rate is ris ing as w ell; and in that case it seem s to m e that there is little dam age to be done by such a m odest incre ase in interes t rates. I want to spend som e time talking about policy rules and the issue of how to operate with uncertainty about the m easurem ent of the output gap. The papers that w ere prepared for this m eeting were, I think, ve ry provocative and in teresting and deserve some comments. The policy prescription from  the simple Taylor rule would yield a m ore aggress ive near-term  tighteni ng than the one I suggested. But a sim ilar tr ajectory ove r time is in th e Greenboo k in the ex tended forecas t. The policy called for under the Taylor rule would fall into two phases. The first pha se would be what I’d call the reassessm ent or the releveling phase. That is, the rule w ould call for imm ediately rev ersing at leas t the easings of last fall for a return  to the prescribed path for th e target funds ra te. The second phase would be in response to changes in the une mploym ent rate and the inf lation rate going forward. 6/29-30/99 94 Now, the Orphanides et al. work on uncer tainty about the output gap suggests attenuating, though not elim inating, the respons e of the funds rate to changes in the output gap. It suggests, therefore, only a part ial return to the leve l-based T aylor rule prescription, but would yield the sam e “phase two” increase in the f unds rate in response to higher inflation. The conclusion in these papers that policym akers should downweight their respon se to chang es in the ou tput gap in the face of uncertainty abo ut its measure ment is both very intuitive and very sensible. But th ere is a dif ference, a s emphasized in these papers, between downwei ghting the response to the output gap and ignoring the output gap altogether. This is the dif ference between uncertainty and total ignorance. I would note also that the Orphanides, et al. prescription is symmetric. For those inclined to applaud the downweighting of the output gap at the current policy decision point, keep in m ind that the sam e logic im plies that we should also respond by less to incre ases in the unem ploym ent rate a s the economy weakens. We can’t have it both ways--to be aggressive to a weakening in the econom y and passive to a streng thenin g unless, of course, we want to guarantee higher inflation over tim e. These papers highlight very effectively the im portance of  flexibility in using policy rules. Policy rule s are best used to inform judgm ent, not to displace judgm ent. At times we m ight be willin g to respond  to the data; at tim es we will want to respond to the forecast. Sometimes we m ay have the conf idence to im plem ent level-based rules ; sometimes we m ay want to be m ore cautious along the lines of change rules. Whether we’re prepared to be m ore aggressive or more cautious in responding to changes in the output gap m ay also depend upon initial conditions , in particular where we are relative to the range of estim ates of the output gap. The question rem ains how to apply the insights from  this work. I don’t find appealing the change or growth rule offered by Orphanides. It suggests that we raise the funds rate when growth is above trend, then lower the funds rate when growth falls back to trend. Given that the underlying model im plies that inflation depends on utilization rates and not growth, the change  rule does not seem like a sensible strategy to m e. It implies raising the funds rate when the utilization rate is rising, then low ering the funds 6/29-30/99 95 rate when th e utiliza tion rate s tabilizes at the higher level. The problem  is that it’s difficult to d esign a sen sible ru le in th e face of uncertainty if constrained to linear ru les. The rule I suggested at previous m eetings  is a nonlinear one. It allows for a downweighting of the response to the output gap when the gap is in a range around the best estim ate, but for a sharper response on ce the gap has increased to the point where one is m ore confident that the economy has m oved beyond the level of sustainable capacity. This is consistent with the sensible  view that we should be cautious about fine-tuning, interpreted to m ean aggressive responses to sm all changes relative to our targets. But we should recognize the gains of “crude -tuning,” interpreted as m ore aggressive responses to changes in output  once output has moved farthe r away from the target. Applying this nonlinear rule to today’s decisions would im ply retu rning toward, but not all the way to, the sim ple Taylor rule prescr iption. A 50 basis point increase in the funds rate im plemented over the next few m eetings would, for example, be consistent with a halving of the response param eter of the output  gap in a sim ple Taylor rule. But m y nonlinear rule would also call for returning to a more aggr essive response to further increases in the output gap goi ng forward, given that the unemp loym ent rate is a lready so low rela tive to estim ates of  NAIRU. A 25 basi s point m ove today could be viewed as a partial reversal of the ease that was implem ented last f all, in ef fect a partial re turn to a level-based Taylor rule. This is also consistent w ith a p reemptive ef fort to  limit the upward trend in inflation that appe ars likely to em erge going forward. Let m e emphasize a consideration favoring the second m ove, if it’ s to be m ade, at the next m eeting or two as opposed to later in  the year. My presum ption is that we will be disinclined to tighten after October thr ough the end of the year  because of possible volatility in f inancial m arkets related  to Y2K and to shifts in the dem and for liquidity. While a m ove in November is certainly no t out of the question, I suspect we will be reluctant to take such action. Now, I think the decision about whether or  not to retain an asymm etric directive today is som ewhat less important in light of the fact th at there will be an announcem ent, presum ably, if we raise the funds rate. We can use this announcem ent to convey our sense of the balance of risks. Neverthele ss, I hav e a preferen ce for an asy mmetric directive. 6/29-30/99 96 Let m e note, however, that I think we ar e likely to encount er problem s whether we opt for a symmetric or an asymm etric directiv e. If we retur n to a symmetr ic directiv e, the m arkets are likely to inte rpret today’s m ove as the one and only one that we expect to make this year, unless they doubt we really mean a symm etric directive. As a result, coming m onths, resulting in a rally in the bond and equity m arkets. I would prefer a more m arket neutral result. We could tr y to achieve this by com bining a symmetric directive with asymm etric language in the a nnouncem ent, but that seem s destined to look confused as well as to confuse. If we choose an asymm etric directive, on the other hand, we could feed the anxiety in the m arkets about an even larger  set of increases than  the 50 basis points I expect to be appropriate. In addition, we want to keep our options open for a further rate incre ase as we assess th e data ove r the next coup le of months, rathe r than def initively signal that it’s a sur e thing My preferen ce is for an asymmetric d irective with  a som ewhat  calm ing announcem ent, followed by a return to a symm etric directive afte r the second m ove--if we opt for a second m ove. This has the advantage of conveying the m ost useful inform ation to the m arkets about our intentions and of being truthful. An added benefit is that m oving to a symm etric directive after the second m ove would be a very effective way of signaling that we do not  expect further near-term moves. It would be less inform ative if we m oved to a symm etric dir ective today and then raised rates in August or October.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I am at least a m odified new econom y kind of guy. I have argued in the past here that there is reason to believe that we have had a shift up in productivity and a shift down in NAIRU. The staff m odels have incorporated this and, as I said yesterday, I’d be willing to take their modification as probabilis tically a ccura te. I read the m aterials carefully over the weekend  and I concluded that a 50 basis point increase was appropriate. When Don Kohn circulated the Orphanides  paper, I probably had a perverse reaction to it because it rem inded m e of the 1960s, and I th ink I’m  haunted by that. We 6/29-30/99 97 let inflation get out of contro l then; w e got behind in the game. And I certainly don’t want to do that again. I’m sorry that Alice Rivlin can’t be here  for what I’m  about to say next. We often talked about m aking the FOMC m eeting more like a m eeting--that is, not having canned rem arks so m uch but actually having an interchange of ideas. I will say in that light that, frankly, you’ve all ta lked m e out of a 50 basis point change. The discussion yesterday was less hawkish than I would have  imagined. A num ber of you surprised m e in what you said. The C hairm an had a couple of bites at the appl e, and he eroded m y faith in th e 50 a little bit each time. So I’m  now okay with 2 5. Frankly, I don’t see a huge difference be tween 25 basis points with symmetry and somewhat hawkish talk versus 25 basis point s with asymm etry and som e language in our announcem ent that says this is not the start of a 300 basis point increase or som ething on that order. It’s hard for m e to be certai n, but m y uninform ed unders tanding of m arkets is that they tend to evolve to reflect what  people say over tim e. There will be an announcem ent today. There will be future te stimony. So I don’t have a huge preference on that issue. I suppose I’m  a bit on Larry Me yer’s side of th at becau se every tim e I’ve tried to slice baloney I’ve cut m y thumb! So I’d rather do it in a fairly simply way. But the other could work, so I’m  certain ly not going to dissent from that. I want to say a few things about the FOMC, though. My m ain point is that, whatever we do today, I think we are placing a lot of i mporta nce on future data. So we have to be very careful that we are alert to respond if our present uncertainty gets resolved in one way or another, as indeed we responded last fall. I think we have to repeat that vigilance and readiness to respond now. Along that line let m e make two suggesti ons on things we m ight do. One is--and this m ay violate som e traditions I’m  not awar e of--that I actually like d the experience last fall with interm eeting changes and, since we all have telephones, we m ight want to do more of that. That m ight cut som e of th e wind out of the Fed-watching industry, which I think we would all favor. The second is that lots of  times in our  meetings people have com e up with new indicators that we ought to look at that don’t quite suggest  what som e of the other indicators have suggested. The Chairm an does this m ore than anybody else, but 6/29-30/99 98 everybody does it to some degree. I wonder if  it would be possible to give som e thought to having the staff track inform ation on what I’l l call “lead ing indica tors o f inflation” a nd circu late it to the Committee. One thing tha t might be in it is the unit co st num ber that the Chairm an just talked  about; ano ther is this m odified une mploym ent rate, which includes dis couraged w orkers in the calcu lation of the unemploym ent rate. There are various kinds of price indices that m ight be leading indicato rs of what could happen with what are kn own as the h eadlin e price indices. If we had all of those m ade available to us on a very current basis, f irst of all we w ould all be m ore inform ed and, se condly, we’d tend to be m ore on the sam e page. Therefore,  when we get together  and think about what is going on, there would be less chance of being surprised with new inform ation at the meeting that we hadn’t really thought about. So I would put on th e table the suggestion that we m ight im prove our proces s, if you will, in that way. I’d like to see the s taff give some thought to that. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, I respec tfully but strong ly would oppose the move back to symmetric directive language. If I read m arket expectations at all accurately, I think m arket participants are wi dely expecting th e ¼ point m ove and they are also exp ecting a further m ove of at le ast ¼ po int in the not too distant f uture. So if we change the directive language to sym metry, in  effect we are going to be changing those expectations. Since we are now announcing the tilt under our new pr ocedures, I think it is going to be very difficult to do so in  a statem ent along the lines that Don Kohn suggested. I respect his point of  view, but I’m  just not at all sure that the language of the statem ent that we issue is going to offset the fact that we m oved to symm etry. So to m e it’s a credibility issue. When  I heard you suggest earlier wh at your own expectations  are, what I heard is in m y view best described as asymmetry toward ti ghtness. I think as a matter of  credibility we n eed to r eport that. More fundam entally, I think a ¼ point in crease com bined with a change in the directive language is just not  strong enough in the current situ ation, even given the points that you m ade in your comm ents. Actually, I was thinking that the question m ight com e down to whether to do 50 basis points with  symmetry or asymm etry. I had decided on 6/29-30/99 99 the basis of this kind of logic that even if we did 50, it m ight be m isleading to have a change of language to symmetry. If I m ay, let m e make som e comments on the Orphanides paper. I thought we were going to have a m ore extended go-around a bout that, but I would just m ake a couple of comm ents because I don’t th ink they are un related to the short-run issu e. First of all, I thought the Orphanides paper was extrem ely interesting; it was one of the m ost enjoyable staff papers I’ve read in a long tim e, and I thi nk it’s very useful in m any respects. Apart from  the particular policy conclusions it sugge sts, I think it could m ake an even broader contribution if it led us to evaluate, on a m ore system atic basis, our past decisions and action s retrospectively. The m ilitary , for exam ple, have been  doing this f or years. They devote a lot of resources--tim e, money, and personnel--to trying to learn system atically from  their experience, and I think w e ought to consider doing the sam e thing. After all, monetary policy is not unlike a m ilitary cam paign. It involves strate gy, tactics, uncertain inform ation, and a rapidly changing environm ent. And the stakes are very high. I think a good way to approach th is would be to develop some additio nal real tim e series and also to start routinely keeping real tim e data goi ng forward. Some of that is already going on in the System. But if we were to do the kind of thing I have in m ind, I think it would have to be centered here at the Board. With regard to the paper’s specifics, Or phanides shows that real tim e output gap data are subject to significant m easurem ent pr oblem s. And he concludes that we should reduce the weight that w e give that data, or  more funda mentally that we should m ove the funds rate only very cautiously in reacti on to incom ing data on the output gap. That would m ean, in the context of the paper, that  we would react prim arily to deviations of actual inflation above an inflati on target. But arguably--and this  is really the sim ple point I want to m ake--our m ain policy successes in the 1980s and 1990s have com e when we have acted more preemptively. The go/stop cycl es that all of us rem ember in the 1960s and 1970s were, in m y view at least, often the result of not reacti ng aggressively enough to early signs of rising inflati on pressures. If there are pr oblem s with the output gap, then expectations--to use in th is context, if  we use that sort of  rule, such as survey inform ation 6/29-30/99 100 or bond rates. So it m ay be a good exercise to take on to see if we could develop som e of these real tim e data series to see ho w a Taylor rule would work with those. Finally, I’d like to point out a def iciency in the T aylor ru le as I see it; I th ink it is funda mentally the one identifie d in the Orphanides paper. And that is that the rule suggests that we only need to m ove the real funds rate away from a fixed constant, given by the his torical averag e, if in  fact an output gap or an infl ation gap arises. But as Larry Meyer suggested earlier, even  if these gaps were zero, m acroeconom ic developm ents can make it necessary for real short rates to move and for us to follow and accomm odate those rate changes. An exam ple, one Larry  cited earlier--and I’ve m ade this point in some previous m eetings--is th at an increase in trend producti vity growth m eans that real short rates need to rise. Just to repeat, the reason is that  households and businesses would want to borrow against their perception of highe r future inco me now in order to inc rease current consum ption and investm ent before it’s actually ava ilable. So the  rate n eeds to rise to induce those consum ers and business to defer that spending until in fact the output is ava ilable. The Taylor rule  doesn’t give any attention to that kind of real business cycle reason for a move in rates. It only allows reaction  to inflation gaps and output gaps. So bottom  line, while I r eally enjoye d reading this paper and I think it was extrem ely valuable, I’m  not entirely comforta ble with what I see as one of its m ajor implications, which is that this Comm ittee s hould be even more circum spect than it is now in m oving the funds rate. I believe a case can be m ade that just the opposite is true. And then we can get rid of this situati on where we have 500 reporters and 600 cam eras around this building when we have one of these m eetings! Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. I certainly agree that a m ove today is appropriate. As far as the strength of the action and the way it’s interpreted, I’d prefer to do that with or without discount rate incr eases. Since I believe th at a stronger action now is appropriate, I hope the B oard will consider the issue of the discount rate on behalf of my directors anyway. Unlike Al Broaddus, though, I’m  going to disagree on the issue of the symmetry. I favor a perm anent m ove to a sy mmetric directive. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. I might buy that! 6/29-30/99 101 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. The ha ppy state of affairs is  one where the colle ctive view of the group, when we m eet, is that the risks are in fact balanced. I prefer symm etry in our behavior m ore than in our words, and it troubles m e when there’s asymm etry in our behavior with or without asymm etry in our words. Last fall, when the opinion of the Comm ittee shif ted towar d the view that the risks were on the downside, we m oved very prom ptly over a fairly short period of tim e to a position where the collective judgm ent of the Comm ittee was that the risks were in fact  balanced. I think we should be symm etric about that on the upside as well. When the collective view of the Comm ittee is that the risks are on the upside, we should move as promptly, at m eetings or between m eetings, to get back to where we feel th at the risks are balanced. As far as the announcement of symmetry /asymmetry, I think Professor Eisenberg has bitten ag ain, or as the  British wou ld say “Goo dhart’ s law has hit us ag ain.” We and most other central banks have known that announ cing exchange rate targets or levels or something of that nature is a rather foolish thing to do; it comes back to haunt us. We have lea rned with m onetary ta rgeting  that if the wisdom  of the m arket is that they know the trigge r point- -that if som e growth rate of som e money m easure is epsilon above or below a cer tain lev el, that is go ing to trigg er a policy a ction--it isn’ t goin g to work. That’s because it doesn’t elicit the behavior in the marketpla ce that would occur if th ey didn’t know what the trigger was. Imagine the absurdity if we were to announce this  afternoon th at the Comm ittee voted today to raise the f unds rate ¼ point at its next m eeting on August 24 and, therefore, w e plan to sav e the airfare and the travel tim e and just not show  up then because we’ve already d ecided we are going to d o that. Well, that’s rather absurd. So I think announcing som ething that is interprete d by the m arket as m eaning that we have already decided to raise rate s at our next m eeting, as I think the May announcem ent was interpreted, gets us into an undesirable position. I can tell you already that I don’t want to go into the October 5 m eeting with a pred isposition to raise rate s because I don’t want to be blam ed for the crash of the stock m arket in October! [Laughter] I also know that I want to get to the December m eeting--and po ssibly even the N ovem ber m eeting, bu t I’m much m ore certain abou t the Decem ber m eeting--clearly feeling that the risks are balanced. If anything, w e ought to feel that we have as m uch chan ce of lowering rates as 6/29-30/99 102 raising them  once we get to Decem ber and in to the next year. We ought to be ready to go in either d irection. We know there’s going to  come a time when things w ill again be changing rapidly in a downward direction, and I would prefer to en ter that environm ent with the risks in balance. We do not have ba lanced risks right now. I think we need to get to a position where we’re com fortable that  the risks are symm etric as soon as we can. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. I think we do need to rais e the f unds rate 25 basis points today. It seem s to m e that we are largely boxed in  by our rhetoric and we ought to do it and get this episode behind us. There is a reasonable econom ic ratio nale fo r this, given the u ncertainty th at we’r e facing, and that is a “take-back ” rationale from  last fall, wi th financial m arkets and the rest of the w orld doing better. But I think we want to leave open the question of how much of a take-back we need to do. It may be 25, it m ay be 50, or it m ay be 75. Who knows?  I think we ought to shif t the focus back to the economy  and back to the data that come in. If, for exam ple, we becom e more confident about productivity increases, if we have a continuation of the pattern of prices and wages that has prevailed over the past several years, then 25 may be fine. If, on th e other hand, we becom e less confident of the productivity increases and we begin to see so me early warning signs that inflation is picking up, then we are going to have to do more. And we ought to do m ore in those situa tions. As for the tilt, I think we ought to go back  to a symmetric dir ective today. We need to calm things dow n. We need to shift the public ’s em phasis away f rom psychoanalyzing this Committee and back to the econom y; in m y view a symm etric directive would help do that. Announcing the tilt, at least in this initial experim ent, turned ou t to be a cruder instrum ent than I think we had anticipated, larg ely becaus e of the interaction of rhetoric. At this poin t we just don’t know enough to say how m uch, or if, we have to raise rates further, and th erefore we shouldn’t box ourselves in for the future. We ought to see how real ity plays out and go from  there.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, I support your recomm endation for a 25 basis point increase. I would favor asymm etry because I think it m ore correc tly reflects what I 6/29-30/99 103 believe the risks are to the outlook and policy. I would be against symm etry because I fear first of  all that, in itself , it doe sn’t correctly reflect our as sessm ent of the risks. Secondly, I am  also concerned th at it would be m isinterpreted by the market. Obviously a statem ent accom panying symmetry could clarif y things an d indicate w hy the risks are not really symmetrical. But if we are going to go that route, even Jerry J ordan’s recomm endation becomes m ore attractive to m e. And I really begin to w onder whether referring to symmetry accom plishes anything. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I, too, support your recomm endation for a 25 basis point tightening at  this stag e. We ar e in a period of som e uncertainty and we should weigh the data a little more heavily than th e forecast. I think the data sup port a sm all move. The forecas t, with  a 50 basis p oint in crease built in, is perhaps ind icativ e of the need for a further move, but it’s not m andatory today based on what we know. I think there is also som e evidence that because of the high wealth-to-incom e ratio  and also a larger sh are of i mports in GDP that we m ay have a m ore powerful tool here than we t hought. That is som ething Alice Rivlin raised when she was sitting in that seat a few m eetings ago. As to the qu estion of  the tilt, I hav e a slight p reference f or maintain ing the asymm etric tilt. I’m concerned that if  we raise rates and go to symmetry and then put out a som ewhat hawkish m essage say ing we’re stil l leaning in th at dir ection, we will create more rather than less of a tendency to psychoa nalyze what the 17 or 18 of us are thinking. Frankly, in my ideal world wh at we would have is a deci sion, a tilt announcem ent, and complete silence from  the Comm ittee. We are not going to get there, but I think we at least ought to continue the process of trying to help m arkets understand what these tilts do or do not m ean. I’m concerned about crea ting another tool in the form  of a well crafted legal/econom ic docum ent that will g ive the market som ething else to chew over. This is obviously not a strong point of view, and if we go to symmetry with a well-crafted announcem ent by Don Kohn, I will applaud Don’s efforts and try to g et him som ething for his gray hair! But I don’t th ink that’s the better way to d eal with the situation at this stage. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Hoenig. 6/29-30/99 104 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, I support your recomm endat ion. I cam e into this meeting wanting at least a discussion of a 50 basis point increase, and I got that, which I appreciate very m uch. It was very helpful.  Along those lines and in listening to you, my assessm ent has been shaded in term s of th e issue --the issue b eing the d egree and the durability of  productivity im prove ments th at we’re all trying to deciph er. So, I would go with the 25 basis points. It is a m ove up, whic h I think is appropriate. And it represents a continuation of the gradualist approach on whic h we have built a pretty high degree of credib ility o ver tim e, and th at has served us well. Given all that, I would very strongly support a symmetric directive for this meeting. I believe it represents the consen sus of the FOMC and I don’t think we should be anticipa ting the next move until o ne of  two things happens --eithe r we get new inform ation that addresses som e of the earlie r issues you raised, or we as a group have a change in judgm ent. If either occurs, th en we can  change the rate again in  the interm eeting period or at the next  meeting. I think that is th e right approach in term s of dealing with  the m arket and the inform ation we share. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairm an, I support your recomm endation of a ¼ point tightening. My thoughts on symmetry m irror Bo b Parry’s very closely and the views Larry Meyer and Al Broaddus expressed earlier . I judge the sentim ent around the table, certainly m y own, as a judgm ent that one 25 basis point tightening is probably not enough to deal with what is likely to be com ing. So I still think the probability of our needing to tighten further is fairly high. To me it is m ore intellectually honest and m ore credible to go ahead and tell people that, ra ther th an to try to b ack into it w ith a symmetric d irective. I also am  afraid that m oving back to s ymmetry mutes our policy m ove and m akes it too tim id. My two-year-old granddaughter  when she finishes eating says “all done” and has this cute hand signal to say she’s fini shed. I am afraid that not only financial further as only a tiny threat and will quit help ing us in trying to lean against what we see coming. Also, to m e, moving back to symmetry suggests that we’re sm art enough to 6/29-30/99 105 make one s mall ¼ point tightening move and fi ne-tune with a precis ion that I don’t think we have. Finally, I’m  concerned, despite the rem inders that we frequently have m ade a policy m ove from  symmetry, about the view th at we can tell m arkets “so be it” if we asymm etry announcem ent, I think we have creat ed--either intentionall y or unintentionally --an exp ectation th at we will try very  hard, perh aps harder th an in the p ast, to let peop le know where we are headed. I am concerned that even though the data may begin to nudge us in the direction  of additional tigh tening, we m ay wa nt to cycle back through and move to an asymm etric direc tive an d then to a tightening m ove later. That would push the m ove to late r in the y ear th an is n ecessa ry and--as Larry Meyer rem inded us and as I said a t the la st meeting-- will ge t us into the pe riod when I sus pect we will pref er not to be meddling in m arkets while the Y2K s ituation is  in play. So I would have at least a modest preference for an asymm etric directiv e. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I support the recommendation for a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate. I think the issue on symm etry is com plicated by the fact that the language in the directive refers  explicitly to the interm eeting period. The sentim ent around the table seem s to be that we may or m ay not need an increase in the interm eeting period or at the ne xt meeting; I think that’s th e way the m arkets are going to interpret symmetry. But the se ntiment around the table is that , more likely than not, we are going to need som e increas es later in the year, perhaps at the next m eeting or sometime later. So I think the problem  is th at we are getting into a box with the precise wording of that symm etry clause. If it’s c onfined strictly to th e interm eeting period and if we can make that clear in what we say, th en it seem s to me that a symm etrical directive is probably appropriate. I don’t think we want to give a firm  signal that we are rather confident th at we will n eed to in crease rates befo re or at the n ext meeting. My judgment, in reading what people said around the table, is  that we are not confident about that. I would very much defer to your desires in how you want to craft the directive language and the asso ciated wording of the press release. 6/29-30/99 106 Getting awa y from the is sue of  the wordi ng--which is a very important issue and I’m not tryin g to belittle it at all--I certain ly count myself  among those who believ e that the Phillips curve is an u nreliable po licy guide. What that means is that the predictiv e content for the inflation ra te--and I’ll em phasize the “pred ictive”--of the estim ated employm ent gap or GDP gap, however you want to put it, seem s to be very low. But having said that, it is still true that we  must som ehow re gulate the thrust of monetary policy to keep it in line w ith the econom y’s capacity to produce goods. We can’t get away from  that underlying responsibility of tryi ng to m atch the m onetary thrust with the econom y’s capacity to produce. If it is true that output growth and employm ent provi de little insigh t into the inflation rate in the short run, this Phillips curve idea, then I also want to emphasize that the converse is also true--that the inflati on rate does not have predictive content for employm ent and growth. We believe the proposition that as a long-run m atter the inflation rate can settle wherever it m ight be m ore or less in dependently of the unem ployment rate. But we can’t have it both  ways. We can’t believe, it seem s to m e, that the Phillips curve works only in one direc tion or that it doesn’t wo rk in one direction. If there’s no content in one di rection, there’s no content in th e other direction either. That leads m e to em phasize that we should not beli eve that a m onetary policy thrust designed to yield, let’s say, a lower rate of inflation is going to have any predic table im plicatio n for employm ent and growth. I have no doubt that a highly restrictiv e policy could tank the econom y. I think we all be lieve that we c an take th e econom y by surprise and we could produce a significant downturn by m aking a m istake. But I continue to believ e that that’s not th e likely course of events. I think the greater risk to em ploym ent is th at inf lation will dr ift up and will drif t up to th e point wher e it will unsettle m arket expecta tions , and that will put us in the box of saying we just can’t allow this to con tinue. We will get ourselves off on one side and m arket expecta tions  will be de stabilized. So I believe th at the g reater risk to em ploym ent stem s precisely from  a drifting up of inflation. That is m y reading on that. I’d like to m ake a suggestion about the dire ctive language. It seem s to m e that in the general paragraph of the directiv e--I’m  referring to th e version called the draft 6/29-30/99 107 directive wh ich has a b rown cover--w e ought not to be im plying in any way that we are opposed to high em ploym ent and high growth. So I would suggest that we m ove the language on inflation, which is in lines 13 to 17, up to the front so that when we talk about the state of the econom y we put the inflation discussion  first. I’m looking at this draft that was sent around to us with line num bers on it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Which line num bers? 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. The docum ent begins with “the general paragraph,” which says: “The information review ed at this m eeting suggests a continued vigorous expansion in econom ic activity.” In other words, we st art off by talking about econom ic activity. What I’m  suggesting is that we  start off by talking about the inflation environm ent. The wording can’t be m oved exactly the way it is written there, bu t the language about inflation is down in lines 13 to 17. I’d em phasi ze that our concern is with inflation rather than have the very first thi ng in th is direc tive b e a comm entary on the growth of the econom y. I understand very well that there m ay be a problem changing the wording of something like this on very short notice. But I would like to throw out for consideration anyway trying to change the thrust of  this so it doesn’t look as  though somehow we are opposed to vigorous growth by starting right off the bat with that as an observation about the econom y. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let me m ake a suggestion. Clearly, we can’t do it now because it will create a prob lem. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Why don’t you wr ite a m emorandum  and give it to Don Kohn. He will circ ulate it to th e rest of th e Comm ittee and will co llect comm ents. If there is su fficient supp ort for your position, we could bring it to the nex t meeting for determ ination. Is that satisfactory? 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Absolutely. In the press rel ease for this m eeting, if there is a press release, we could put the em phasis on in flation and productivity growth and the uncertainties about them  ahead of the disc ussion of the real ec onom y. Anyway, I throw that out just as a possibility. Let m e say that I con tinue to believe that  greater clarity in ou r inflation o bjective would be constructive. I talked  about this a couple of m eetings ago. I’m not going to say 6/29-30/99 108 that there’s a convincing case th at a CPI of 1½ percent for th e year is going to yield a better econom ic perfor mance than  a CPI of 2½ percent. But I do believe that uncertainty about that matter is worth in the end 100 basi s points in long bonds, wh ether we settle at 1½ or 2½ percent. I think m ost people would say that uncertainty that adds 100 basis points to m arket inte rest rates is go ing to affect the way the econom y works. So I continue to believe that more clarity about what our  real objective is in  that area would be useful. In term s of the m arket discussion about our policy and the language used last time, the disclosure of the asymm etry--the  way I would like to put it in Wall Street language--means that “the fed funds rate is now  in play.” There was a period in which it was pretty stable and no w it is in play. The whole issue is up in the air and that’s going to be true un til things see m to sett le down and the rate s ettles down. The ideal situation would be that both  we and the m arket draw the sam e conclusions from  the incom ing data about what actions are necessary to be consistent with low inflation. That is the sort of  expect ational equilibrium that we would m ost like. I believe the right way to handle this process is to  be sure th at the m arket is very clear about our ob jectives and about our willingn ess to  act to achiev e those ob jectives. As the data arrive on both the real econom y and the inflation rate and on productivity and everything else we look at, we  would hope that the m arket would com e to the sam e judgm ents as we would about how to interpret that data. The hope is that we’re not just looking at ourselves in the m irror when we try to assess m arket reacti ons to the data. We should try to give to the m arkets a sense that we’re all in this  together in term s of trying to make sense out of the incom ing flow of data and that we don’t have an absolute conviction by any m eans about where all of th is is going to take us. That is, we don’t have a conviction about how m uch the federal funds rate is going to have to m ove or even in which direction necessari ly. Given that we’re not very far off of the right place to be, we think the rate is going to depend on how the data com e in. I have a m ild preference for an asymm etric directive, I suppose, because I think it accura tely d escrib es the tenor of the Comm ittee’ s feelings ab out this. But I th ink also that we need to have som e discussion that  emphasizes to the market that as ymm etry 6/29-30/99 109 should not b e interpreted  as a forecast of an automatic 25 basis point increase at the n ext meeting independently of what happens. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I, too, favor a ¼ point increase in the fed funds rate. I think it’s appropriate econom ically and the m arkets are prepared for it. As far as the question of symmetry is concer ned, I am  on this issue where I usually am, which is that I have a deep-seated, built-in bias  toward symmetry. So, I f eel that way this time. My preference is s imply to assess th e inco ming inf ormation and act if action is appropriate. If we want to accom pany that with som e semi-hawkish lang uage about h ow we view the prospects, that’s fine with m e. But I must adm it I’m  not at all sure how the It seem s to m e that it’s shorthand to  say tha t the m arket is simply trying to psychoanalyze the Fed and guess what’s going to happen next. Another way of saying that, along the lines Bill Poole talked  about , is that they ’re loo king at the s ame inform ation we’re look ing at and th ey’re tryi ng to piece it to gether and u nderstand w hat it means for prospective econom ic perform ance, monetary policy actions, and so on. be the f irst time there has been a lo t of intensity in  that ef fort.

MR. MCTEER. We don’t know and can’t  know what is over the horizon. Inflation m ay be on the verge of accelerating or it m ay not be. Certainly a strong case can be m ade that it is. But a sim ilarly strong case could have been m ade this tim e last year and this tim e the year before. Had we tried to enforce the speed lim it based on contem poraneous estimates of NAIRU over thes e last few years, we would m ost likely not today have inflation under 2 percent and une mploym ent near 4 percent. I’d hate to see us lose our nerve at this point and risk  bringing the experim ent to a prem ature end. I’d rather continue to test the growth lim its of the new economy unm odified. But if we have to have a m odest tightening, I h ope it can be accom panied by a retu rn to a neutral bias to take som e of the nervousness out of financial m arkets. That was the statem ent I wrote just before you talked earlier, Mr. Chai rman. Here’s what I wrote afterwards. [Laughter] This is just a shorter version of the sam e thing: For reasons that you 6/29-30/99 110 described so eloquently a while ago, I would pr efer to keep our foot off t he brake and continue to test the lim its of the new ec onom y that you described. Your comm ents led me to believe that if the Comm ittee were not boxed in, you would have recomm ended at this m eeting no change in the fed funds rate. Therefore, to get out of the box, we should adopt an unbiased directive at this m eeting and, as Ed Boehne put it, calm  things down. Longer term we m ay wa nt to revisit my earlier suggestion that we stop voting on a directive bias or Jerry Jordan’s alterna tive that we m ake a perm anent m ove to a symmetric d irective.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I have just a few comm ents on the longer term . First, I too was very impre ssed by the discussion we had at our board meeting of the Chicago and Detroit directors when they gave thei r presentations about electronic comm erce. We did it a little differe ntly. We divided the board ahead of tim e into groups on banking, services, retail, a nd m anufacturing--we had done a background paper for them ahead of tim e as well--and then they organize d the presentations them selves. Many of them  did a lot of work preparing for them  and I think the presentations really were very enlightening. I cam e away from that discussion, and from other things that I have read and heard in talking to people abo ut this, with the f eeling that som ething profound is clearly happening in electronic commerce and its im pact on firms. I just don’t know how significant it is  in term s of its imp act on the econom y. It’s an area where we are all learning and we’re going to continue to learn in the com ing months and years. And I look forward to studying in m ore detail your very helpful comments at this m eetin g. As for the decision today, I certainly agr ee with the 25 basis point increase. On the tilt, I th ink it’s a very close call. I thought th e earlie r discussion with Don Kohn a nd your comm ents, Mr. Chairm an, were very help ful. I think we are som ewhere between the full tilt and symmetry at this point. On ba lance, I com e back to the point I m entioned before: that our cred ibility--o r more specifically, your cred ibility --is extrem ely important and at this point it’s extrem ely high, too. So, I would defer to you on this question. But my preference would be for asymmetry. Unde r the current circum stances I think 25 b asis points and no tilt will be m isinterpreted unless accom panied by a very strong statem ent 6/29-30/99 111 and strong language in your testim ony. Even then, it still m ay be m isinterpreted as “that’s it,” as I believe J ack Guynn said. So, I prefer the asy mmetric directiv e but I will defer to you on this. On the question of the tilt itself, I th ink we clearly have som e learning to do before we know how to use this new tool effectively. To quote you, Mr. Chairm an, this is one area where we’re engaged in “on-the-job training.” It’s a new tool and we’re in a new environm ent. We have tightened before  from symm etrical directives, but this is new. I recall your m entioning at a m eeting several years ago that back in 1994 when you were planning to start a series of tighteni ng m oves, you had a great deal of difficulty signaling that intention to the m arket at that  time. Clearly, th ere’s no difficulty today in that type of signaling. We’ve said  that we are going to be m ore transparent with this tool. If we go with symmetry, I view that as being less transpa rent. That’s m y own personal view. In my mind there are ques tions about th e usefulness of the tilt its elf. Just listening to the discussion around the table today, it’s cl ear that there are very wide differences among the m embers of this Comm ittee as to exac tly what the tilt m eans. If we keep the tool in p lace, I think we will be us ing it a lot less  than we did  before, as was predicted last year when we discussed this. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think the c onversation around the room  is m aking us m ore Jordanian than we had been. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an. I have thought for som e time that we needed to take back at leas t a portion, if not all, of the ea se in m onetary policy that we enacted las t fall in th e face of  chaotic financial m arkets. Certainly, the prospects for external growth, the fact that we have not yet seen a rise in inflation, and that som e of the temporary factors that have been keeping it  at bay are unwinding give m e even m ore cause to think that we should unwind that easing in m onetary policy. So the question today for m e was not whether to tighten but how much to tighten. I know there’s a great deal of uncertainty now and I accept the poin t of the res earch  on this sub ject, which is that the m ore uncertain we are the more sl owly we should move, taking tim e to assess things. That strikes m e, as others  have said, as rather intuitive. Now, both the Greenbo ok and our o wn forecas t suggest th at at least 50 to  75 basis points of tightening are needed this year just to keep a li d on inflation in 2000. Keeping 6/29-30/99 112 the lid on inflation thereafter wi ll require m uch more, as the longer-run analyses suggest. It’s true that these an alyses are don e in a tr aditional way, usin g the traditio nal cons tructs of most of our m odels, and th ey are s ubject to a lot of uncertainty. They incorporate some estim ates of the output gap; they in corporate a rev ision to tr end pro ductiv ity; an d they also incorporate assum ptions about NAI RU. Some people would debate the validity of this stru cture. Certain ly, if we continue  to hav e acceleratin g productivity growth, these estim ates of output gap and NAIRU a nd so forth m ay be wrong. But in a tim e of uncertainty, it certainly seem s that relying on c onstructs that have helped us bring about nearly 20 y ears of better econom ic conditions --milder cy clical turns, ever lower inflation, lower unemploym ent, and m ore sustained grow th--has validity. It seem s appropriate to look back on the things that have helped us create the kind of  environm ent that President McDonough referred to, one in which m ore pe ople are working, m ore people have that experience of working, and the benef its of grow th are shared more fully by all. I think the argum ent really turns on whether we want th at environm ent to continue. If we want it to continue in a way that extends the experi ence of those 20 years, then we need to be careful in containing inflation and in f ollowing th e constru cts that have helped us get where we are. So, assum ing m onetary policy should be  forward-looking even in a tim e of uncertainty, we do need to tighten policy now . I agree with the proposal f or 25 basis points. The next question is what to say a bout it. Based on the an alysis both in the Greenbook forecast and in our own forecast, I do  think we are likely to n eed to do more. In that regard, I favor keeping an asymmetric  directive. Jack G uynn outlined all of the many reasons why I think asymm etry makes m ore sense at this tim e. I wonder whether what we’re seeing now in  term s of the m arket reaction to what we’ve said about our tilt is as m uch a reac tion to the change that we’ve introduced in announcing the tilt as it is to anyth ing else. Over tim e, as m arket part icipants get used to our announcing this and moving or not m oving at the next m eeting, I wonder if their reactions are going to calm down considerably; pe rhaps as we get used to it the m arket will ge t used  to it as well. In my view one of  the reasons we decided to d o this was to improve inform ation to the m arket f rom the Committee itse lf rathe r than from disparate members of the Comm ittee. In that regard, the prem ium is on honesty. In order to be 6/29-30/99 113 honest about what I feel the course of  future actions should be, th e directive should be asymm etric. Finally, to reiterate another point that I believe Jack Guynn mentioned, 25 basis points, no tilt, but som e hawkish language, as has been suggested, m ay well create a bigger m arket reaction when all that com es out . There will be m ore uncertainty about how we’re using this language. Frankly, without an asymm etric tilt, I think we’re likely to see the market get ahead of itself--experi ence a som ewhat euphoric increase, thinking that we are not engaged in the kind of tightening that I believe m ost people think is necessary. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. As I read th e Committee, we’re strongly in support of a 25 basis point increase and m odestly in support of symm etry. So I would sug gest th at we read th e directive in that context and then proceed to vote. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD. This tim e we’re on page 22 of the Bluebook, at  the bottom  of the page: “To prom ote the Comm ittee’s l ong-run objectives of price stab ility and sustain able econom ic growth, the Comm ittee in the imm ediate future s eeks condition s in reserve m arkets consistent with  increasing the federal funds ra te to an average of around 5 percent. In view of the evidence curre ntly ava ilable, the Co mmittee believes tha t prospective developm ents are equally likely to  warrant an in crease o r a decreas e in th e federal funds rate operating objec tive during the interm eeting period.”

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. I have dr afts of a num ber of different announcem ents concerning this decision, and I’ll read the one that I think most closely reflects the Comm ittee’s views: The Federal Open Marke t Comm ittee today voted  to ra ise its targe t for th e federal fun ds rate 25 b asis points to 5 percent. Last fall the Comm ittee reduced interest rate s to counter a significant seizing-up of financial m arkets in the United States. Since then m uch of the financial strain has eased, fore ign econom ies have firm ed, and econom ic activity in the United Stat es has m oved forward at a brisk pace. Accordingly, th e full deg ree of adjustm ent is judged no  longer necessary. Labor m arkets have continued to tighten over recen t quarters, but strengthening productivity growth  has contained inflationary pressures . Owing to the uncer tain r esolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the econom y going forward, the FOMC has chosen to adopt a directive that includes no predilec tion about near-term  policy action. The Comm ittee, nonetheless, recogni zes that in the current dynam ic environm ent it m ust be especia lly alert to the em ergence, o r potential emergence, of inflationary forces that could underm ine econom ic growth. Is that wording satisfactory?
