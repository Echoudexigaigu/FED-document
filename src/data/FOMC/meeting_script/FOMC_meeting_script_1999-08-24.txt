CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good m orning, everyone. Would som ebody like to move approval of the m inutes for the June 29-30, 1999 m eeting? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DON OUGH. So m ove. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objection. We need to elect Ms. Cumm ing a nd Mr. Howard as Associate Econom ists to serv e until the election of th eir successors at the first m eeting  of the Comm ittee after D ecem ber 31, 1999. President McDonough, would you nominate your colleague? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Yes, I would like to nom inate Christine Cumm ing for that position. She has a Ph.D. in econom ics from the University of Minnesota and is a very highly regarded career professiona l at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Most recently, before we put her in charge of  our research group, she was the brain trust for the bank supervision function of the Bank. She’s a very good econom ist and I’m  very happy to nom inate her.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The “ ayes” ha ve it. Karen Johnson, would you do the honors for David Howard?  You do know hi m, I hope! 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON. Yes. Dave Howard has b een a m ember of the Board’s Division of International Finance for alm ost 25 years and has worked in several of the areas of the division. Recently, owing to the passage of tim e and the departure of some people, he was prom oted to Deputy Director of the division. He has a Ph.D. from  the University of Virginia, is very well rounded in open econom y international m acro issues, and is a very thoughtful econom ist. I think he wo uld be an as set to the Co mmittee and  I recomm end him to you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. I assum e no discu ssion is required, at least I trus t not. If so, the presum ption is that Da vid Howard is elected unanimously. I’d also like to recognize First Vice Pres ident Jam ie Stewart who is attending his first meeting. We welcom e you. Peter Fisher, would you review developm ents in foreign currency and dom estic financial m arkets and dom estic open m arket operations? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. In front of the m embers of the Comm ittee is a pack age of charts, sim ilar to the one I usually show.1/ I will beg in by address ing agenda item 3, m y report on m arkets and the Desk’s activ ities. The first page, covering the period from  June 1 through August 20, presents a slightly different configur ation of charts than I usually show you. The top panel depicts U.S. depos it rates, current and forward; the middle panel shows yields on U.S. Treasury secu rities ; and th e bottom panel shows the percent change in various equity m arket indices. In the top panel, you can see that  from the tim e of the Comm ittee’s last m eeting on June 30 until the Chairm an’s Humphrey-Hawkins testim ony on July 22, current and fo rward 3-m onth deposit rates m oved more or less sideways. They began rising f airly consistently af ter the Chairm an’s testim ony through the tim e of the release of ECI and GDP data and the nonfar m payroll em ployment num bers, and then cam e off noticeably following the publication of the PPI on August 13 and, two days later, the CPI. Even m ore interesting than that m ovement in rates is the changed structure of the forward rates from  the beginning of June to the beginning of August. On June 1, shown at the far left-hand side of the chart, the 6-m onth forward 3-mont h rate and the 9-m onth forward 3-month rate were trading rather closely together at around 5.8 percent and the 3-m onth forward rate was around 5.4 percent. Now, I would suggest that the proxim ity of th e 6-month forward and the 9-month forward rates had to do with the m arket’s exp ectations that the Comm ittee was likely to tighten a bit in the future. They didn’t quite know when, and they didn’t know what  would happen after that. There might be just one m ove. So, som e of the term  prem ium between those two m aturities was squeezed out. By August 1, you see that the 6-m onth forward rate had shifted and was then tr ading in line with the 3 -month forward rate. Several things happened in the m onth of July, I think.  Obviously, the m arket’s attention 1 / A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Fisher  is appended to the transcript. 8/24/99 3 was focused on the Chairm an’s Humphrey-Hawkins testim ony, particula rly his comm ent tha t the Committee would act promptly and forcefully. There was increas ing attention during the m onth on the funding pressures antic ipated in the fourth quarter  and in early January as a result of the century date change. Also, there was the rolling forward of the m aturity of these contract s, which changed each day. To m ake the point very specifi cally, on August 1 the 3-m onth forward 3-month rate involved a deposit whose term covers precisely the period when the greates t pressu res are e xpected--November, December, and the 3-m onth forward rate actually traded  below, even if just a few basis points, the 6-m onth forward rate. Now, I’m  not s ure the m arket’s expectations  are co rrect. But the fo rward rates are showing us that the window, erasing whatever term  prem ium one might expect to exist between the 3-m onth for ward and th e 6-m onth forward because of the anticipated pressures around the year-end. Turning to the m iddle panel on Treasury yields, you can see that those yields more or less followed th e sam e pattern relative to the data releases. However, just before the release of the nonfar m payroll data on Treasury’s refunding announcem ent in which Treasury officials discussed the introduction of buy b acks and the elim ination of the 30-year auction in Novem ber. That rally was short lived, unwinding after the release of the nonfarm payroll da ta. I’d note that the 30-year bond from  Friday, August 20 through today traded  at a rate identical to the rate at which it closed on June 30, the da y of your last m eeting, whereas both the 10-year and the 2-year rates are roughly 10 basis points higher. In the bottom panel you can see that  equity m arkets here in the United States m ore or less tracked inversely the m ovements in yields. If we include yesterday’s change in the D OW on that panel, th e increas e in th e DOW woul d be 6.6 percent. Turning to the second page and to  European m arkets, the top panel shows the forward rates and current rates for 3-m onth deposits on euros. As is eviden t in th e middle of  the top panel, the 9-month forward 3-month euro deposit rate jum ped appreciably following the European Central Bank’s press conference on July 15, during which President Duisenberg suggested that there was bias creeping into the ECB’s delibe ration s. Several d ays later, on the releas e of German IFO survey data on business confidence, whic h was som ewhat stronger than expected, th ere was a very abrupt ju mp in the 3-month forward deposit rate; but that was com pletely unwoun d subsequently. What I think is 8/24/99 4 notice able b oth in th e top panel and in the m iddle panel depicting European bond yields is the extent  to which these rates m oved in response to U.S. data releases and m oved m ore or less in a pattern sim ilar to tha t in U. S. markets. The bottom  panel shows the euro- dollar exchange rate. One can see that the euro has m oved up a bit off its lows aga inst the do llar, particularly in the week of July 19 to July 23. There are two stories circulating in foreign exchange m arkets about movem ents in exchange rates. One is that a revival of gl obal growth, especially in Europe and Japan, will be narrowing growth differe ntials with  the United States. The second is that the Fed is about to tighten and that that will be bad for U.S. assets and bad for leverage and, theref ore, for the dollar. Now, both of these stories could be true. I don’t m ean to discount that possibility. But I would note that m any observers, particularly in the foreign exchange narrowing of global growth differentials . But it seem s to m e that the asset m arket m ovements reflect m ore of  the latter story--that is, the fear that a Fed tightening will be bad for assets and bad for leverage. In the bottom panel, one can see that in the week beginning July 19, following Duisenberg’s comments about  creeping bias, the dollar cam e off quite abruptly. That Monday m orning several large asset m anagers thought it was an opportune tim e to buy euros. They did not expect the kind of exchange m arket reaction that  occurred. They found a very, very thin m arket and the dollar m oving downw ard quite briskly. It appears to me and to others, in hindsight, that th e market was very th in partly in anticipation of the Chairm an’s Hu mphrey-Hawkins testim ony. That dollar trend accelerated som e on the re lease of th e Germ an IFO survey data even though, as you can see in th e other panels on the page, the IFO survey had very little im pact on fo rward rates or on the yield curve. I would underscore that the dollar is still quite strong against the euro. If my chart depicted it through this morning, it would be trading at 1.05. Transla ting this m orning’s ra te into a rate m ore familiar to us all, the dollar-m ark, that rate would be 1.86. So, I just w ant to em phasize that, regardless of its m ovements against th e euro, the dollar in historic term s is quite strong. Turning to the third page, whic h depicts Japanese m arkets, you can see on the left side of the top panel th at Japanese forward rates rose a bit following the release on July 29 of stronger-than-expected Japanese industrial production data for June. Japan’s IP w as plus 3 percent on a month-over-month basis as opposed to minus 1 percent in May. But it is hard not to notice that, again, Japanese  forward r ates m ore or  less in the ir 8/24/99 5 own m uted way also are tracking the pattern of U.S. forward rates and U.S. interest rate expectations. There has been m uch attention paid to the Japanese equity m arket of late, and its move ments are shown in  the m iddle panel. But a ll that chatter is now overshadowed by the extraordinary perform ance of bank shares in the Japanese m arket foll owing the m erger announcem ent of last week. On this scale, if the ba nk index included Monday’s trading, the Topix Bank Index would show a 26.8 percent increase over its June 1st level. The bottom  panel shows the value of the yen exp ressed ag ainst the dollar and the euro. Since your last  meeting, the Japanese authorities intervened o n three o ccasions--on Ju ly 5 in con junction with the release of the Tankan Survey and again on July 20 and 21--for a total of We acted as their agen t on one occasion. I think there are two distinct periods to focus on here in  term s of the dollar’s m ovem ents. During the week of July 19, the dollar weakened against both the euro and the yen. But as you can see in the blue line on this panel, the euro­yen rate was m ostly unaffected. That was the week during w hich the story, and bond yields started backin g up. I would note that the anxiety about a Fed tightening being bad for assets was particularly acute in Tokyo. Market participants and also Ja panese officials, I’m  afraid, have coalesced around the view that a Fed tightening in 1999 is likely to have the sam e impact on the dollar as the 1994-95 Fed tightening episode. I don’t share that view. I think that’s a bit of a stretch. But that view has becom e rather widely held in the Tokyo m arket and also by the Ministry of Finance. In the m ore recen t episo de las t week , the yen app reciated ag ainst both the dollar an d the euro. At the star t of last week Governor Hiyam i suggested to Japanese co rporate leaders, I think wisely, that they should take m ore responsibility for he dging their own foreign exchange position s. That had quite an im pact on the m ood in Tokyo. Later in the week, f ormer Vice Min ister Sakak ibara som ewhat less wise ly let s lip that further in tervention by the Japanes e author ities was not lik ely until the yen/dollar rate reached 110, and the m arket promptly obliged him  and traded down  toward tha t level. Turning to the next page, the char t depicted there for the period from on various spread relationships betw een private instrum ents and comparable U.S. Treasuries. Severa l of these spreads have widened to levels above those of last October. In particular, note that the 10-year Fannie Mae benchm ark and the 10-year U.S. swap rates, sho wn at the 8/24/99 6 bottom  of the chart, have backed up above their prior peaks of last grade co rporate securities, the gree n line, and the mortgaged backed securities, the red line, haven’t quite backed up to  their prior peaks, but they also have been rising. Corpora tions and federal agencies have been eager to lock in what th ey perceive as rath er low rates. They used the swap m arket initially to try to lo ck in those rates, and the aversion of swap m arket inte rmediaries to ho lding on to f ixed rate risk h as led to the sharp backup. Now, I want to be very clear that  I think this is q uite d ifferent f rom what was happening last October. There is no sense of panic in these quite thin an d that the in termediari es are quite reluctant to hang on to risks. We have triple checked the da ta for the period of m arked volatility in the swap rate las t week, when it oscillated 10 and 15 basis points from one day to the next, and those are valid data points. The other thing I would point out is that the lower grade cred its, the more risky credits if you will, such as mortgage b acked secu rities which are shown on the chart and junk rated issues not depicted here, have not backed up to their peaks of last fall. I would not want to suggest, however, that that is an indication th at everything is warm  and fuzzy in those m arkets--on the contrary. But th ere is v ery little b eing issued in those m arkets as opposed to the rath er strong issuance of higher grade credits. So part of the reason why those rates haven’t backed up further is becaus e of a reluctance to issu e in those m arkets. Finally, turning to dom estic oper ations, on the next page you can see that there w as very little of note in the fed funds m arket during the interm eeting period. Deviations of the funds rate from  target and the intraday standard deviat ion in the volum e were quite m oderate. The only point of note was that the dem and for excess reserves appeared to run a little below the allowance of $1.2 billion that we had in the path. Mr. Chairm an, during the interm eeting period w e had no foreign exchange op erations on behalf  of the System  or the Treasu ry. I will n eed the Comm ittee’s ratification of the do mestic operations in the period. Also, I sent to the Committee a m emorandum  on August 9, explain ing my intention  to ra ise the per-issue lim it in our se curities lending program  from  25 percent to 45 percent. I would be happy to answer any questions about that at th is tim e or on any other aspect of m y report, before your vote to rati fy the dom estic operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions for Peter?  President Minehan. 8/24/99 7 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Peter, I don’t have a problem with the proposed change in the lim its under the S OMA securities lending program , but I do have a question. Apparently you have identified more than one dealer m isusing the program , trying to gain som e kind of dominance in a particular issue at a particular time. I know th at in such cases you disallow their par ticipation in the  program  until they give som e evidence of  having  changed the ir strategy, but I just wonder whether that’s a significant enough puni shment. There are aspects of this that go to the Salom on situ ation. I wonder whether their prim ary dealer relationship should be at stake. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Let m e distinguish a coupl e of things. First, if I thought the manage ment of any dealer firm  was not taki ng seriously the intent  of our program , we would escalate th e issu e rather quickly. I believe the problem we’ve had in the f irst three months of the program  is that som e traders looked to take what advantage they could of it and did not understand the last reso rt nature of our program . So, in each case where th is has happened--where a dealer appeared to have a large position and was also bidding in our auction --we suspended their b idding for that issue until such tim e as we were persuaded that their positio n was m ore in lin e with th e intended usage of our program . We have dis cussed already, Cathy, that if th ere were m ultiple infractions  from  a single dealer and the m anage ment didn’t am end its wa ys, the first step would be to suspend them from  use of the program  for a year or som e period like that. We are still discussing what constitute s a “strike” and  whether our  rule shou ld be two strikes or three strikes and you’re out. I would be inclined to pur sue it that way--by prohibiting th em from  using the program . I think the analogy to the Salom on case is a little extrem e. I don’t want to overplay it, but raising the lim its per issu e-­

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. That will help. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. But not changing the per-d ealer bid I am  hope ful will reduce the potential for dealers thinking they can m ake some thing of this. So th at is one incen tive for us to ra ise th e lim its at th is tim e. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Peter, I have another que stion along those lines. When you brought this before the Comm ittee the concept, as you’ ve just suggested, was m ore or less as a lender of last resort. But the frequency of us e over the period strikes m e as being far more 8/24/99 8 than la st resort; it s eems to m e to be part of  an everyday facility. Why the  frequency of use if it is a las t resor t facility? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. There are quite a few different  U.S. Treasury securities outstanding. For any one of them , I don’t think the frequenc y of use is continuous other than for on-the-run issues. But one of our m ajor incentives in this program  was to try to reduce the risk of fails to de liver in the on- the-run issu es. So we  always anticip ated th at the use would likely be frequent with respect to t hose issues. It is not the sa me dealer borrowing every time. That gives m e som e comfort, and I hope would give the Co mmittee co mfort, that the program  is being used by the vast m ajority of de alers approp riately as a la st resort. I want to underscore the overnight borrowing constraint  we put in the pr ogram . We only lend securities overnight now, wher eas previously we lent them  for a one-week term . The dealers them selves view that as a fairly oner ous condition. They would much rather finance a short position for a one-week or a one-m onth term . To have  to com e back every day means that in an operational sense borrowing from  us truly is m uch m ore like a las t resort for them . So in tha t sense I th ink it r eally  is consistent with how we set up the program, although in a period when Treasury supply is contracting as rapidl y as it is, I believe one can understand why the facility is be ing used as m uch as it is. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. We probably should expect at least as m uch usage going forward? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Furthe r questions for Peter? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Shall I move approval of the dom estic operations? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I would suggest  that som ebody had better do so. [Laughter] Without objec tion, they are approved. Item 4 on the agenda is a very im portant i ssue being brought before this Comm ittee. It is one that probably is ripe fo r discussion and certainly it was not  at an earlier stag e. But by now I believe we are all begi nning to get a sense that, while w e cannot pin down the whole array of Y2K effects, the broadened range of  things that could potentially go wrong has grabbed our concerns. I don’t know how the rest  of you feel about what is going on, but I’m feeling an in creas ing uneasiness abou t a low probability--and perhaps very low probability-­developm ent. And that is the potential for a very significan t adverse ev ent in the finan cial 8/24/99 9 general nature. I think we can all probably assum e, as the Greenbook assum es, that things will ess entially work th eir way out. I don’t deny that that is a very, very h igh probability. But we are the central bank, and what I’m  concerned about is that we have a fiat m oney system . This m eans in effect that with som e limitations--both legal and from our own rules --we can expand m oney as m uch as we choose.  What I hope does not happen--and this is the re ason why it is qu ite relev ant for Peter to address th ese is sues at this tim e--is that we will f ind tha t very low probability ev ent occu rring and our ab ility to add ress it som ehow hobbled solely by our own rules of operation. The issues that Peter will raise and the authorizations that he will reque st, w ith the exception of the authority to do 90-day RPs, are solely for the purpose of handli ng potential Y2K problem s and, th erefore, should be sunset. What we will want to do,  of course, is  to rev iew how all of  this worked out af ter the ye ar-end period. We can m ake judgm ents at that poi nt on whether those authorizations should be allowed to expire, as I think we  all hope at the mom ent, or whether som e should be retained or even expanded. But the essent ial issue here is one of insura nce, with a relatively modest prem ium, against a potentially ca tastrophic, very low probability event. With that, Peter, would you outlin e your p roposals to u s? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Included in m y package of charts are two contain ing a revised list of the votes that I will b e requesting. They provide a guide to m y specific requests. In that regard, there is som e revision from  those in the m emo I sent you on August 17. To begin, as I explained in m y memo of A ugust 17, m y first proposal is to rem ove the constraint of  the guidelines that restrict our operations in federal agen cy securities. These “Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations  in Federal Agency Securities” have been in effect sin ce 1977. The for mal pro posal I w ould like to m ake is to ask the Comm ittee to suspend the guidelines u ntil April 30 , 2000. At th e FOMC meeting in March of next y ear I would expect to review thoroughly our experience with tem porary operations in agency securities an d, as I’ll exp lain in a m inute, our use of tri-party arrangem ents in our operations in agency securities in general. So, that is  the f irst item  I would plan to request. 8/24/99 10 As m y memo spells out, Board staff and New York staff see reasonable p otential for reserve needs to grow during th e fourth quarter by around $100 b illion. I want to be clear that that is n ot a forecas t; it is a s cenario. I’d als o like to be clear that my own seat-o f-the-pants judgm ent is that our range of potential error is about th e sam e size; that is, reserve needs m ight be $50 billion or they m ight be $150 billion. I don’t know  how I could tell you with any co nfidence where reserv e needs are going to  fall within th at ban d. If they co me in at $50 billio n, that will b e just terrific and we won’t have the k ind of strain that I’m concerned about. If they com e in at $150 billio n, triple the amount we’ve ever injected into the banking system  at a tim e of peak dem and for reserv es, we  will face so me considerable challenges. As I outlin ed in the m emo, but perh aps I should have given s ome more emphasis to this, the supply of Treasury securities and st raight agency debt in which w e conduct our temporary operations is going to  be subject to som e considerable dem and. The entire private secto r is going to be engaged in a fli ght to quality and will be  looking for liquid ity. There was an article in y esterd ay’s Wall Stre et Journal about the m any corporate issuers who were so proud of them selves for borrowi ng all the m oney they need through year-end in the third quarter instead of the fourth quart er. Nowhere in the ar ticle did it m ention what they were going to do with that m oney now that  they’ve bo rrowed it. They aren’t going to put it und er their m attresses! They a re going to tr y to put it in Treasury b ills o r in short-term deposits and m ake the banks put it in Treasury bills. I’d also like to unders core the fact that foreign central banks are busy changing their operating p roced ures in o rder to accep t U.S. Treasury securities as coll ateral for their open m arket and discount window lending operations. So the whole world is th inking th at around the year-end the place to be is in U.S. Treasuries and, as a close substitute for that, straight  agency debt--precisely the Therefore, I’d like to exp and the pool of co llateral that we can accept in ou r tem porary operations around the year-end. In fram ing this proposal we focused on the language of the Authoriza tion for Dom estic Open Ma rket Oper ations itse lf. That autho rization a llows the Desk to oper ate in all U. S. Government secu rities, “securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and intere st by, any agency of the United States.” Significantly, that would include m ortgage-backe d securities that are agency pass-throughs 8/24/99 11 because they are “guaranteed as to p rincipal and interest” and  thus would fall within the scope of the Authorization. There are two constraints on our  ability to do this. One constraint is the Desk’s own custody system s and our com petence in valuing m ortgage-backed secu rities. I’m not try ing to disparag e my colleagues and our staf f, but we simply have never developed the skills to value m ortgage-backed security collateral. We do not have the custody system s. And I blush to th ink what kind of suppl emental budget authority I’d have to request for the second half of th e year to try to build those system s, which probably would be im possible, or  to acquire the necessary st aff, which would be nearly impossible. The other constraint relate s to the 1977 “Guidelines,” which in practical effect constrain us in two ways. First, because of the structure of th e Aut horization for Domestic Open Market Operations, we presume that we  can conduct temporary operations only to the extent that we can conduct out right operations. Since the A uthorization lim its the types of securities th at can be u sed as collateral in  our repo operations to t hose securities that are eligible f or purchase --and since the Guidelin es set rather low thresholds for outright operations in federal agency securities--that re striction would carry ov er and constrain our temporary operations. In today’s m arket, how ever, when we accep t collateral we simply aren’t in a position to pick a nd choo se the co llateral d ealers o ffer us or to set very precise limits on tha t collate ral. That is no t how th e repo m arket works today. The other principal effect of  the Guideline s is that they effectively preclude us from  operating in GNMA securities, which is p articular ly coun ter-intuitive given the str ucture of  the three m ajor agencies. Therefore, in order to expand the pool of collateral during the fourth quarter and early in the f irst quarte r, we n eed to se t up tri-par ty cus todian a rrangements with the two major clearing banks, Chase and Bank of New York. The entire dealer comm unity uses th ese two banks; half of them  are with one  and half are with the other. And we would sim ply try to piggyback in this very short tim e horizon on th eir existing tri-party cu stody arrangements. As noted in my m emo, this would be m ore or less identica l to the ar range ments we currently have with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt for the m anagem ent of our euro-denom inated Germ an governm ent securities posted as coll ateral on the repos through which we invest System  and Treasury foreign currency reserves. 8/24/99 12 I should add, as m entioned in m y memo, th at the tri-party cust ody arrangem ent would also perm it us to take Treasury STRIPS, which our current system s are not configured to do, also expanding som ewhat the pool of collatera l. I guess that about summ arizes the m ajor points. So, focusing on this first request, m y view is that suspending the 1977 Guidelines until April 3 0, 2000, as I m entioned at the ou tset, would give us a window of opportunity to expand the collateral pool so we can hope to m eet the year-end upside risks. Then, as I say, we would review at the tim e of the March meeting the tri-party arrangem ents and all our operations in agency securities before the temporary authority lapses. I’d be happy to answer questions on the reserv e needs or on this proposal. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Let’s do that now. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Peter, I don’t have a bi g problem  with what you are proposing, but I think som e of the principles in the 1977 Guidelines are quite valuable. I’m thinking especially of  the first two. I’m wonde ring if we really need to suspend those to get what you want. Might it not be possible to suspend some of the guidelines but not all of them ? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. As you m ay recall, in m y Augus t 17 m emo I proposed th at the Comm ittee act upon m y request with the understa nding that we would still adhere to the principles incorporated in thos e first two paragraphs . I suggested that a statem ent to that effect could be included in the m inutes of this m eeting. I’m agnostic about the precise wording on which the C ommittee votes. The Se cretary of t he Co mmittee m ay have a view. I’d be happy to suspend only paragra phs three through six of the docum ent. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. It’s m ainly the fourth  one that gives you the difficulty, right? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. It is paragraphs four and fi ve that are giving him difficulty. I think keeping the first two paragraphs and suspe nding the rest would be fine. That would accom plish the objective. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. That is basically what was suggested in the m emo. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. This would be a m ore for mal way of doing that.

MR. FISHER. It is identical  in spirit to what I w as suggesting in m y August 17 memo. I’d be happy not to suspend those first two guidelines.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 8/24/99 13 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I have a question abo ut the reserv e needs. The Treasu ry balance is expected to be twice as high as usual at year-end. What are the m ajor reasons for that? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. The Treasury is forecasting its total cash balance at roughly double what it was last year. I’m not expert in this; Don Kohn or som eone on hi s staff m ay be better qualified to respond, but $20 billion of that has to do with th e rules Congress passed for--

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Credit unions. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. So that bum ps the level up c onsiderably. Then the rest is a safety buffer for t he Treasury. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. That’s so they can m eet their obl igations very early in  the year if people have troub le getting cash  to them . They want to  be cer tain th ey will hav e plenty of  cash to meet their n eeds. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Let m e underscore that our prob lem in this a rea is th at the Treasury ’s starting po int, when they  told us abo ut this, was that they we re going to p ut all this ca sh comfortably in Treasury Tax & Lo an (TT&L) accounts. I just don’t believe it is going to sit there. I think the banks are goi ng to push that back to us. I might even be m ore comfortable if the Treasu ry were to le ave som e rather la rge share of that cash on our balance sheet. That would put us in a better position to reduce the vo latility of  day-to-day fluctuations stemming from  what com es out of the TT&L a ccounts and what com es back to us. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I assum e, incidenta lly, that tha t will incr ease the supp ly of Treasury securities available as  collateral by a co mparable am ount. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, but the TT&L b anks will h ave to have a ddition al-­

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. No, I wasn’t referring to the T T&L accounts. I’m saying that if Treasury uses the cash to bu ild up its TT&L accounts or its balances at the Federal Reserve, it would not be  paying off Treasury securities. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. That’s right. If the cash is in the TT&L system, the banks have to have colla teral against that; an d if it is on o ur balan ce sheet, we’ ll have to ge t collateral somewhere. It won’t be one-f or-one in Treasu ry bills. There will be a little m ore supply out there, bu t the asset side of the balan ce sheet-­

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So it’s largely a zero-sum  gam e in this particular discussion. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I have another question on needs with regard to currency. There is no indication at this point, is th ere, that the es timates on curre ncy needs are anything different from  what we’ve been as suming? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Well, currency in circulation is still running ahead of norm al, obviously, so there is som e early  store of value accumulation going on. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. But I m ean the am ount that we’v e accum ulated is also ru nning far ahead of norm al. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, by som e $300 billion. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. We don’t see any reason to thi nk that the Federal Reserve won’t have many times the am ount of currency that will be demanded in the fourth quarter. That’s not an issue. I think the issu e is how m uch will be outstand ing in the hands of the public and, therefore, how m any assets the Federal Rese rve will need to hold to offset that. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Exactly. But I was wondering if anything has led us to revise our estim ates on  that? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. No. We’ve done som e analysis of the surveys that have been done of households. Interestingly, they tend to clus ter around the $500 per hous ehold level--if we make som e assum ptions and drop out the extrem es--that we used for our  planning purposes. Now, even that m ay be high. But, as best we  can ascertain, the inten tions of households and of banks to get currency are all roughly cons istent with th e estimates we used in th e planning that we were doing som e time ago. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Okay. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. We have been doing som e thinking about this in New York. One issue that is novel, at least in my thinking in the last m onth, is  that if currency is going to flow m ore quickly through the banking system --that is, when ba nks draw on us and the cash goes out--there will be less of a benefit in hol ding vault cash. That’s because, having m oved to lagged reserve accounting, they actually take a debit. They ask for cash from  the Fed and they have to pay us, so that’s a debit to rese rves. They get th e cash in the ir vau lt and it 8/24/99 15 counts four weeks later. If it’s m oving faster  through the system , that vault cash is never there to be counted as reserves for th em. If it’s s till on h and it can be coun ted, but if it is flowing m ore quickly--. I don’t fully understand the im plications of that yet, but we think there m ay be a little difference in how we view that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Whe n the “how l” level goes u p, you’ll understand it very m uch more quickly! 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, I think you’re right. There are a lo t of uncertainties h ere. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I just want to speak to that issue and partly to the issue you raised at the outset, Mr. Chairm an. My own view is that  there is a very big gap at present between reality and perception, particularly in the m arkets. The reality is that at  least with regard to U.S. dom estic m arkets, things are in really  good shape, as you’ve pointed out. There’s a very low probability of a big problem--though we’re likely to s ee glitches here and there--at least in m y view. The perception, however, is focused a little m ore heavily on that probability a nd there is a lso this se lf-reinf orcing logic in the m arket that is m aking everybody really nervous about having no liquidity  in the fourth quarter of the year. I hear this from  a lot of different sources --from  State Street an d other investm ent people in the First District. I was at a conference last week  in Aspen and am ong the m arket people there I heard this sort of chatter. It gets w orse every tim e it is discussed in the sense of feeding into people’s fears. So I think this proposal, as we ll as the others, is a very good way of closing that gap between reality and perception. These actions  should m ake m arket participan ts comf ortable that ev en if there are little glitches, w e are going to go out of our way to m ake sure that we can either inject or sop up excess liquidity so  that funding will b e available in the f ourth q uarte r if they need it. In particular, I feel str ongly that the use of tri­party arrangem ents is a great idea, particularly since it allows us to ope rate after th e close of the book entry wire. If reserves need to be absorbed, the Desk can handle it. Bringing this issue before the Comm ittee was a really good idea. The writing of the m emo in its entirety was extrem ely well done. It was very interestin g and provided a lot of inform ation for us to evaluate, and it contained som e pretty original and useful s uggestions on how to deal with this problem . The sooner we can announce so mething to the dealer community along these lines the better off we are going to be because  the gap I m entioned would start to clos e. 8/24/99 16

MR. FISHER. Turning to Item  B, I woul d like to ask the Co mmittee to a mend the Authoriza tion perm anently to giv e the Desk auth ority to operate for periods of up to 90 days in our repurchase agreem ent operations. To be  candid, as m y memo says, with the benefit of hindsight I wish I had asked f or that auth ority last yea r whe n the Committee ra ised the maximum maturity on re pos to 60 da ys. I think the norm al difficulties we  face over almost every year-end period w ould be well m et by 90- day repos. The 90-day term  is also the standard in the m arketplace and I see no reas on why we should intention ally be d ifferent from  the standard m arket practice. If we  had a good reason, I’d be happy for our practices to be different, but I think th ere is som e benefit in trying to operate in a way that is consistent w ith m arket practice. And particularly  this year, we would li ke to start to address the buildup of pressures as we  approach the year-end throug h term  operations that w ould roll off in early October and then extend them  through the end of February. As I said, I wish I had asked for 90 days when we discussed this last y ear. I think it is the righ t place for us to be perm anently in any event. So I’d like to ask for 90-day authority.

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Item C, to am end temporar ily th e Authoriz ation f or Domestic Open in som e detail. 8/24/99 17 Matched sale purchases and reverse repurchas e agreem ents are functionally equivalent transactions. But the prior view  in the System  had been that we were only authorized to do matched sale purchases and not re verse repu rchase tran sactions. In recent years, as I think the various m emos in your package explained, the evolving view was that reverse repos are within our authority. The dealers have for many years been strongly urging us to m ove from  the m atched sale paradigm  to the revers e repo paradigm . Our outside auditors have been pressing us to do this. They are m uch more comfortable with the accepted m arket practice of reverse repos and would like us  to get away from  the involved accounting methodology used for matched sale transactions . The legal m emos in the package suggest that the switch would be acceptable to our la wyers, though recognizing th at it would b e a change from a prior view . Let m e be clear th at I h ave been plan ning for some tim e to ask  the Comm ittee for the authority to do reverse repurch ase transactions--as you can see from  the dates of the m emos --in conjunction with the Desk’s acquisiti on and developm ent of a new trading and process ing system . We are cu rrently finishing up a proposal that we will be bring ing to the Board to seek approval to spend the monies on a new system . As part of putting in place a new system , I had been intending to ask for this authority. However, we won’t be able to do revers e repo s as par t of our regular o perations un til we bu ild a new syste m, which will be a t least 18 m onths or 2 years from  whenever we begin and m aybe longer. We plan to have a phased introduction of the new system  in all our operations. Now, in considering the use of tri-party ar rangem ents, we realized rather early on in our thinking that tri-party opera tions offer us the opportunity to  operate later in the day, as Cathy Minehan has already alluded to, on both th e add and the drain sides. The add side presents us with no particular problem ; we can pursue that as we  talk to the clearing banks. But on the draining side, if we are trying to get this done for year-end and just want to piggyback on their existing system s, there is no possibility of getti ng the dealers and the clearing banks to rebuild their systems. They m ight not want to do it anyw ay, but there is certainly no prospect of accom plishing it ahead of  the Y2K date chang e to accomm odate our current m atched sale accounting system . So if we wa nt to pursue the developm ent of  a contingency plan--and I want to be very clear that I’m not certain we can m ake th is work, though I’m  hopeful that it could be a 8/24/99 18 useful tool f or us--it will depend on som e systems we haven’t yet built. And it will depend on the willingness of the dealers to accommodate us late in the day, to change their balance sheets in response to our needs. If there’s too m uch liquidity in the banking system , they ought to be willing to do  that, bu t I don’t want to pretend to y ou that I can  go out and m ake this happen all by m yself. However, to do that we would need to adopt the reverse repurchase authority so that we could do those transactions through tri- parties. Given that we’re not going to be able to put this in our  new system  for at least a couple of years, temporary authority to do reverse repos is certainly what we need just to get us through the fourth and the first quarters. But you are on not ice that I’m  interes ted in this f or the lo ng run, too. W e can see how it goes over the turn-of-the-year period. So, I’d lik e to ask the Co mmittee to a mend te mporarily the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Opera tions to authorize reverse re purchase transactions by adding the langu age shown as paragraph 1(c) in Attachment VIII of my August 17 m emo. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I would sugge st, since your coughi ng suggests that you’re dying, that we have Norm  Bernard read the paragraph! 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD. This would involve an a dditional paragraph to the Authorization under section 1, as Mr. F isher wa s just m entioning. The new paragraph 1(c) would read: “To sell U.S . Governm ent securities and securiti es that are d irect obl igations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States to dealers for System  Ope n Market Account under agreem ents fo r resale by dealers of such securities or obligations in 90 calendar days or less, at ra tes that, unless otherwis e exp ressly autho rized by the Comm ittee, shall be determ ined by com petitive bidd ing, after applying reasonable limitations on the volum e of agreem ents with individual dealers.”

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. The “ ayes” have it. Let’s m ove to Item  D. 8/24/99 19 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairm an, turning to It em D, I’d like to ask for tem porary authority to sell options on re purch ase agreem ents, reverse repurchase transactions, and matched sale purchase transactions through the end of January 2000. The language, w hich we will come to, was in Don Kohn’s m emo to you of yesterd ay, which was included in your packages last night. Let m e give m y view s on this and explain why we’re seeking this authority. As the Chairm an said at the outset, th ere is a small risk of some extrem e events at the end of the year that I think it pr udent for us to lean against. From  my perspective, I’d just like to offer the view that to a certain extent  we are seeing som e expectations am ong m arket participan ts that a re already a problem. There is a problem now. Cathy Minehan referred to it and the Chairm an was allud ing to it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. The p oint I was m aking was not solely the technical problem . I was referring even m ore to the psychological problem . 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, I understand. I just want  to focus on the problem  that we already see today of growing levels of anxiety and uncertainty on the part of financial interm ediaries, both banks and securities fi rms, which they are comm unicating to their custom ers in ways that are very unhelpful. Let me elaborate on that. The banks are telling their custom ers: “We may apply quotas. We may not take your depos its. We may give you a zero or negative interest  rate.” And securities firm s are telling their custom ers: “Don’t count on us; we m ay not be able to finance you in the last week of Dece mber. Go look elsewhere.” And that is crea ting uncertainties about the func tioning of financing m arkets, particularly repo m arkets, in the weeks around the year-end which go beyond the problem just of how much collateral we can get. One of m y motives for this request is to tr y to pu t som e limit on th e upside risk of that potential developm ent. It is not just a quant ity is sue. That is,  if the m arkets are no t functioning--if the dealers are not willing to be on both sides of the m arket for us in som e depth--regardless of the am ount of collateral we’re prepared to extend, we m ay find it quite difficult to carry out our objectives. So I see appreciable risks that m arket conditions m ay frustrate the Desk’s ability both to add and dr ain reserves in the pe riod around the year-end and to keep the funds rate trad ing aro und th e Committee’s target. I feel it would be 8/24/99 20 imprudent of m e not to seek your ap proval for the tools that I believ e are necessary for the Desk to carry out the d irectiv e. As I outlin ed in m y memo and as I m entioned, I think, at the May m eeting, our havin g the ability to write options on repos, reverse re pos, and m atched sale tr ansactions could be quite effective. In my view it has not just a reasonable prospect but the greatest prospect of enabling the Desk to carry out its m ission in what  could be extraordinarily illiquid m arkets. Whether or not som ething goes wrong in the m arkets, we are reasonabl y certain that these circum stance will occur is the risk w e’re un certain about, but I’m  reasonably confiden t that these m arkets will not be  tame. The idea, as my memo explained, is to au ction op tions on repos and matched sale purchases for exer cise during the days or weeks immediately surrounding New Year’s Day at rates that w ould b e in som e band around th e Comm ittee’s fed funds target. Now, I want to be candid a bout a dilemm a we face. I believ e the g reatest impact this device could have is the announcem ent effect. Its secondary impact would be in actually providing low-cost assurance to the interm ediaries that the m oney m arkets would not becom e dysfunctional and that funds w ould be available in som e band around the Comm ittee’s target rate. However, it would be a measure of success of the program  if very few of these options were exercised. If they are purchased, that will give the m arket som e comfort. So if they are exercised, that would be fine; but it would be even better if m arket players came to the conclusion th at they  didn’t need to exercise them . The dilemma is that, while I believe the gr eatest impact would be in the announcem ent effect--at least I hope it would be --I’m not quite sure that we can develop the precise details of the program  I would like to ask you to approve  without talking to the dealers. I think we need a candid back and forth flow of discus sions with the dealer comm unity on how to struc ture this program . We have som e ideas. I outlin ed the m in m y August 17 m emo. But a practical issue is that w e have to put a good face forward and show that we have som e confidence in announcing this and also work out the details with the dealers to m ake sure this app roach is rea lly practical and will have the intend ed effect. And thus Don’s mem o to you of last night indicates that we seek this rather broad authority--I’ ll be candid about that-­fully understanding that we’ll have to work out quite a few details to m ake it actually fly. I’d be happy to answer any ques tions I can about this request. 8/24/99 21 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Mr. Chairm an, I have more of a comment than a question. I think our approval of what Peter is recomm ending here is extrem ely im portant and in f act v ital. The f irst three resolutions we’v e already ag reed to really had to do with being able to carry out our norm al responsibili ties at the end of the year plus having som e damage control capability. Damage control is  som ething I’ve lived with for a long tim e because in my first job in the U.S. Navy I wa s a dam age control officer.  One thing that you figure out on a ship that is very capable of sinki ng is that the best way to control damage is not to have any. So you’re always better off to  be in the risk-avoidance business. And this essentially is the situation we have here. Probably un til about a m onth ago, I was of  the view that the dam age control capabilities that we have alrea dy agreed to would be adequate --that we could get financial interm ediaries to respond essentially in the way that we got them  to respond last fall. And that is that they pulled up their socks and deci ded to m ake m arkets, which is part of their job. But as President Minehan ha s suggested, it is also very cl ear to m e that regardless of how m uch we lean on the financ ial inte rmediaries to m ake m arkets at the end of  the year -­and I probably would do the leaning --it is lik ely th at thos e efforts will not be successful. It is sufficiently likely that we ar e well advised to use this addi tional tool. The conversations I’ve been having with very respons ible head s of m ajor institu tions are m uch like those Cathy has had. They feel their responsibility to their shareh olders and their customers is such that they have to protect them selves. And if we were in their jobs, that’s essentially what we would do. They are not paid for being patriots; we are. Therefore, I’m absolutely convinced that we need this capability largely to avoid risk or at least to reduce risk. And as Peter has suggested, if we’r e com pletely successful in the message we give, we m ay never have a single one of these options exercised. That would be victory. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Not ex ercised and not even purchased. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. That would be even  better! I think the likelihood is that the dealers will purchase them . And Peter is absolutely right in that we need to have the agreem ent of the Committ ee in order to go out and have m eaningful discussions with the dealers. We can’t go out  and say, “W ell, we’re thinking of doing this; 8/24/99 22 as an institution and a Committee that woul d be it--even though, as you could see from Peter’s m emo, that’s where he started or where he started with m y support. But as tim e has gone on, I’ve com e to the view that we absolutely  have to have the capability to say that the Comm ittee has approved our doing this and now  we are figuring out the details. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, I don’t have any question about the need for these types of tools. But I do have a question--if we can  put on our BS&R hat for just a m oment--that relates to us as a cen tral bank. If a bank or ot her financial ins titution were to engage in these types of activities, we would be interested in whether or not they had conducted sim ulations to ascertain what the im pact of these activ ities w as likely to be on that in stitution. Then we’d expect that to be shared with m anagem ent and their board of directors, and so forth. Is that a step w e should take?  And if so, should th at step be taken before  we approve this?  In my experien ce tha t is so mething we think is v ery important f or priva te institutions. It seem s to me that we could have sim ulations show ing extrem e events that cou ld have rather important impacts on the Federal Reserve System and the financial system , and I think it is something we ought to look at. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. If I could respond, P resident Parry, I think a m ajor differ ence between this institution and the private institution you’re  referring to m etaphorically is that our cost of covering this option is quite different. If a private firm  were to write options on financing, their cost of cover would be m arket-based. They would have to find financing out in th e marketp lace. That is the risk of opti ons to priv ate participan ts. In this case, we would only be writing options on our own balan ce sheet. While there are upside risk s in terms of the growth of our balance sheet, and that’s obviously what I’m  trying to constrain, our cost of cover is not a real  constraint. I think the challe nge for us is how to price the prem ium sufficiently low , becau se in m arket-based term s we face no real risk here. We have som e transactional risks. There are risk s, I want to be clear, but we don’t face the kind of risk a private in stitution would face in prov iding this service. And that is really wh y it works at all.  If we were a private in stitution, this would be a very risky u ndertak ing. Early on in m y thinking about this--this was a m onth or so ago--one dealer told m e that a custom er approached them  and asked them  to provide  an option on over-the-weekend financing for 8/24/99 23 they could charge that custom er that they  would be prepared to have known publicly because of h ow they saw the risks. In their vi ew, the risk to their reputation was too great. They would have to charge such a high prem ium that they did n’t want the charge for th at risk known in their custom er base. For our balan ce sheet, just the reverse is true. It’s hard to figure out how low to price this b ecause we  do not face a m arket-based risk of cov ering the option. I do think that m akes a considerab le difference in a com parison to a private institution. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I’m sure there are differences. Does that lead you to conclude that looking at such sim ulations is not appropriate? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I’m sure it would be appropria te if I thought we c ould do it. You’ve seen the con fidence interval I hav e on my estim ate of reserve needs for the fourth quarter. It’s around $100 billion. I ask you to think for a mom ent how much better I could do in trying to anticipate what the use of this program  would be, especially where the u ltimate goal is not to have it used. Our hope is to minimize the exercising of the options. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Presiden t Parry, I thin k Peter’ s goal is to achieve the FOMC’s objectiv es for keeping the federal funds rate in a range around its target. The very high likelihood is that if people wanted to exerci se the options because rates we re high, that would be a day on which Peter would be doing lots and lots of RPs.  So, in effect, I don’t think this presents a risk to u s. It may actually help to limit th e risk that he wouldn’t be able to m eet his objective of calm ing m arkets down. So, if a nything, it reduces the risks relative to his objective. Secondly, there are issues having to do  with where the RP ra te is relative to the federal funds rate. But the very high likelihood is  that if the RP rate is very high--so that people want to do these RPs with us--the federa l funds rate would be very high. And that would be a day on which the Desk would be a dding a lot of reserves, and the exercis e of these options would be only the first step in what would likely be a long list of reserve-supplying operations that day. On the other side, in the case of a reserve-absorbing operation- -if the ra tes are so low that they’r e in effect doing the m atched sales with us--we’d probably be doing m atched sales that day also. So, if anything, these m arket instrum ents reduce the r isk that Pe ter won’t be ab le to h it his objective, w hich is obviously very different from  the profit and loss risk th at a co mmercial bank would face. 8/24/99 24

MR. BROADDUS. I think the cas e for this is pr etty pe rsuas ive.

I think we should be aware of that. I know this is a vote on a tem porary authority, but temporary things som etimes becom e perm anent.  And certainly before we decide to do anything like this on a perm anent basis, we ought to consider the broader im plications relating to p ublic perceptions.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. That’s the reason why it’s es sential that most of  this new authority gets sunset. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. I have a question al ong the sam e lines. In view of all the other things that are in p lace--the sp ecial liqu idity facility and all the things we are going to be doing to m ake sure that everybod y knows we  will be m aking m arkets and operating  to the full extent--I can still see som e concerns am ong individual m arket players. I’m not sure whether you’re worried more about bank deal ers or nonbank dealers;  my guess is nonbank dealers. And I think they still would be con cerned about the distributi on of liquidity. It’s not that the aggregate is a problem , but rather  the distribution, with everyone trying to get through the door at one tim e. You’ve used a fe w words that get near but don’t quite answer what I’ve been puzzling about. You’ve said  “auction;” you’ve said “insurance;” you’ve talked about the pricing. But auction im plies supply as well as dem and, s o you have to for m e, and for everybody else I guess, how somebody in a d ealer operation would explain, to whom ever they have to get approval from , that they want to bid at the Fed’s auction to buy an option. What is it that they’re gaining and how m uch should they be willing to pay for it? 8/24/99 25 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Obviously, and I think m y memo was candid about this, the problem  of setting a reservation price and what we would ask the dealers to bid for in the auction is a major challenge and one of the prim ary reasons I want to ta lk to th e dealer community. I think an auction sale is the righ t approach to take; the problem is how m uch to auction. We want to have  it open ; we want to have  com petitive  bidding and  a rese rvatio n price s et quite low. I don’t have an absolute an swer on what the right qu antity is to auction each day or how to conduct the auction. Again, that is why I wa nt to talk to the dealers. So I want to give you a scenario that’s in m y mind but I don’ t want you to think that I’m invested in any one of the details. I would im agine that there would be a two-week period on either side of the year-end in which the dealers could exercise overnight opt ions either on m atched sales, reverse repos, or repos. I’d say that som etime in Octobe r we w ould begin auctioning each day a set quantity of overnight options for any one of t hose 20 business days. One way of thinking of the arithm etic would be that we m ight be prepar ed to put up to $200 billion on either side of our balance sheet. If we had 40 days’ worth of auctions, we’d be auctioning $5 billion a day for each of the one-day overnigh t windows the d ealers could bid on. I think I will h ave to put out som e proposal like that as a straw m an in talking to th e dealers in order to get their creative juices flowing on how to think about the reservation price.  We want to set it very low, but we don’t want the opti on to be a free go od. They w ill want it because it’s ch eap, but not because it’s free. In earlier discussions about this I said I didn’t want them  to think it was as cheap as water, but  under the drought circum stance I’ve learned that everything has a price! So it would be som ething like that. I’d be  tempted to begin discussions by talking about settin g a rath er low lim it. It’s easier to raise the au ction lim its than  lower them  in that environm ent. I’m just trying to think about wa ys of creating an auc tion process the dealers would participate in. The id ea of having a sm all am ount au ctioned each and every day would be a way to get the dealers to anticip ate their dem ands and not  wait until the e nd--to try to sm ooth out their dem and and buy a little each day. For this to be successful and involve the right kind of pricing, it is not that I want to see the price st art high, but I’d like to see it trend lower as the m arket relaxes a bout the availability of  year-end financing. Nevertheless, I want to be clear that I don’t kno w today what the right lim its are. I think 8/24/99 26 there are limits. There are som e very tricky i ssues we would have to  think about, such as what assets we would be putting out for doing the m atched sales and whether we’d be doing them  through tri-parties or through our DVP sy stem , which is why both are m entioned in Don’s proposed paragraph. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. May I ask a follow-up question?  You m entioned already that, in their scenario, when the currency is going out banks  are also going to be  thinking about that currency com ing back in. W hat are they going to do with it? Are they going to get to count it toward m eeting their reserve requirem ents? I can see thos e in the banking industry doing their own exercis es--seeing tim es when they are concerned about ad equate liquidity and they want som e insurance and then seeing pe riods of excess liquidity and wondering how to get rid of it. I can im agine both. It seem s to m e that it would be im portant in your conversations with the dealers to ask them  their ideas about quantities and prices and so on. I’d also want to find out if we offer this and if they buy this insuranc e--these rights to get liquid ity or put liqu idity to us --what is it that they otherwise would have done that th ey will not be doing as a consequence of  our m aking this available. I say that because we are going to alter their behavior from  their ow n con tingency planning that assum ed this program didn’t exis t. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I mean to offer these as ex amples, because I b elieve the reaction s are likely to be quite diverse. The anxieties of the m ajor m oney center banks, and therefore of the m ajor bank dealers, tend to be focused on what to do with the su rplus cash they’re going to have. They are afraid of being excessively liquid. So I think they would likely buy in on the cash-put collateralized option drawn on us. My hope is that that would perm it them to be less obnoxious in talking to their custom ers about the risks of zero or negative overnight interest rates on corporate depos it accounts because the banks would be more confident that they can pay som e kind of m arket-based rate. So that’s a behavior we do want to see changed. On the dealer side, the prem ier deal ers in the world have been telling custom ers not to count on them  for financing around year-end and it’s m aking their corporate custom ers very anxious. I think the behavi or change we’d like to see among the m ajor dealers is that they would be  less obnoxious in telling their custom ers to go away and not count on them to finance their inventory of  securities during the last two weeks of 8/24/99 27 to change. I agree with you that there are bound to be other behavior s that would change that I haven’t anticipated. But those are the two I ’m aiming at; I’m  trying to get the interm ediaries to behave m ore like interm ediaries and less like risk avoiders. My hope would be that the m arkets would behave m ore as we would like them  to. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Along that line, one good outco me might be that the dealers would simply pass these options through to their custom ers. That is, if they took the options and in turn en tered into th e same contract w ith th eir custom ers--custom ers who don’t have access to the Fede ral Reserv e either throug h the pr imary dealer network or because they’re not commercial banks or other depository institutio ns--that would afford those custom ers som e degree of confidence. They would know that they could put the securities back to the dealer, who would in turn put them  back to th e Fed or they could borrow  from  the dealer on a collateralized basis, an d the dealer in turn  could borrow from the Desk collateralized. So, having these pass through the prim ary dealer syst em to the other m arket participan ts I think would potentially be a very  positive developm ent. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Forgive m e for interrupting, but I would like to underscore what Don just said. I think the only reason to do this is to have the dealers pass the benefits through directly or indirectly. There are accounting is sues that I'm  not going to be able to think through here as to how th is would all work, but  we will s trongly im press on the dealers  that they ar e to m ake the benef its of this  available to  their cust omers. That’s the purpose of the exercise. It is not to have  the dealers sleep better at ni ght while their custom ers don’t. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, I understand the im portance of Y2K concerns, but I want to follow up a bit on what Jerry Jordan wa s saying. I know that Pe ter Fisher and others have scrubbed this proposal pre tty carefully, bu t in te rms of the analys is I’m  not as clear as I’d like to be. And I am a true believer in  the law of unintended consequences. When you want to do things and get them  done for the righ t reasons, you think of all the positives. But without som e fairly rigorous analysis, you tend no t to think of the other side. I worry, given the speed with which we’re taking this forward, that we m ay not have thought of all the negative consequences, and that leaves m e uneasy. One other comm ent I would m ake is that  necessarily--and I u nderstand the reasons-­there is a great deal of vagueness in this proposal; one uncertainty is even  the strike p rice. I 8/24/99 28 hope in stru cturing this that we keep in m ind many of the conditions we h ave in th e special liquid ity facility as we g o to thes e individual dealers, because we are treading on new ground as far as how we conduct m onetary po licy. And even though th e authorization is temporary, it does have implicat ions going forward that I ha ven’t had the opportunity to think th rough. I hope th at as the details are wo rked out we will be b riefed again on what is being decided with regard to the strike price and the reservation price. I know you have to talk with the dealers, but it leaves m e uneasy to think that they m ight be structuring this program . So, those are my concerns. I know Y2K is im portant and I don’t dim inish that, but I do have these reservations  that I wanted to r aise. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Let me just comm ent. I think there is no q uestion that there will be adverse consequences. We’re going  to change certain types of behavior in ways that are very difficult to anticipate, and presum ably some of thos e changes are going to be adverse. One of the advantages of  having this as a tem porary program --one would presum e--is that we will see a num ber of the a dverse outcom es and we will not be locked in to maintaining the program . I think the argum ent that we perceive of this as a tem porary reaction to a n idiosync ratic ev ent ten ds to lim it the types of  institutional changes tha t might occur as a consequence of it. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. That does give m e som e solace. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If you think abou t it, the pote ntial downside risks of  not doing som e of these thin gs are ju st awesom e. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. I understand. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Could I add a comment?  In your package of charts, page 10 is a background chart that I did not di scuss but would like to point out to you, P resident Hoenig. I have given som e considerable thought to adverse consequences, and the one I’m  most concerned about is whether we would discourag e market interm ediation in som e way when, in fact, we’re trying to encourage it. I’ve at  least thought through what the worst perverse consequences would be if we discourag ed m arket interm ediation and arbitrage opportunities. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Very good. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. What the chart shows, starting from October 15 of last year across the top panel and March 23 of this year across the bottom , are the rates on repos on Treasury 8/24/99 29 collateral in blue, the rates on m ortgage-backed securities co llateral in re d, and the morning federal funds rate. The latter is based on an in form al survey we take in the m orning that tells us where funds are trading. There is an extraordinary correlation here, which is wonderful to see; it shows that m arkets work an d arbitrage takes place. Most of the spikes on the chart are at m onth-end or on T reasury ref unding dates or tax paym ent dates. It’s all rather predictable behavior. I’m drawing it to yo ur attention to show that even in the chaos of last fall, shown at the upper left, the ra nge in which these repo rates m oved during the morning, the m ost active tim e of the day, was c ontained at 4.25 to 5.75 percent. And that even includes the period through the year-end last year, and I’m sorry that  precise date isn’t shown. So, in m y memo I discussed a 150 basi s point corridor on either side of the then-existing funds rate target. That’s so mething we w ill want to talk abou t. I think it is g oing to be hard for it to be any tighter, with the preced ent of the special lend ing facility on th e one hand and the coincidence of the negative 150 ba sis points, which is our m inimum bid when we lend out securities and put out collateral. So if we we re to do m atched sales and put colla teral out at a tigh ter spread, I think we would be creating som e perversions. Now, I want to be able to talk to the dealers about this and think about it. As you can see, the corridor in which rates actually vary is very narrow. So a range of 150 basis points is considerably wider than the range in which nor mal arb itrage takes place. Therefore, with respect to th e issue of th e most perverse uni ntended consequence, I think anything like the spreads we’re going to talk about is really going to be the disa ster insurance. We’re trying to offer the m arket disas ter insuran ce to ge t them more comf ortable inte rmediating within that range. I just wanted to  be clear that we’ve done som e of the work here. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH. Let m e make a comm ent tha t I hop e will be helpful to President Hoenig and others. The way we envision introducing this to the prim ary dealer comm unity is at a m eeting at which the heads of the firms would be invited to the Rese rve Bank and I would be their hos t, with Pete r Fish er joining me. We will m ake it very cle ar to them  that this is not th e “Prim ary Dealer Benevolence Society Act, ” but rather that we expect them to behave in a responsible way, as we are,  in carrying out their function as a financial interm ediary. If they try picking us off, they m ight succeed. But we want them  to know--and  we will let them  know--t hat the price of that will be very hig h and will last very long. So, I think we can m ake su re that they d on’t get confused about that. 8/24/99 30 They should n’t th ink that because this involve s matters th ey are m ore experien ced with and more clever about than we are,  which is true, that therefore they can lead the holy innocents off to slaughter, so to speak. We will m ake su re they understand that if they try to do that, they’ll get caught and th e price will be extrem ely high. I persona lly would not be w illing to support this if we were not prepared to m ake that very clear to them . Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. While I recognize that there is som e risk on the opposite side, let m e relay an anecdote from  a recen t conv ersation with  a very sen ior person at one of the major investm ent banks who is responsible for a lot of their funding operations. He said, after an anguished discussion about all of the fourth-qua rter concerns those in the investm ent bank community have, and I quote, “W e will not b e heroes.” His comment was quite pass ionate and heartfelt. By showing that we are willi ng to be m ore innovative and a little fleeter of foot than usual and that we are willing to work with them  on the details, I think we could be a bit of a hero. And we should be as the central  bank. As a side point I would reiterate what Tom  Hoenig said in that I’d love to hear  what the details ar e after you’ve had your discussions with the dealers. Not to be doing this would really risk a lo t of potential dam age in the period around the turnover to  the new m illennium . I’m very m uch in favor of this, as I’ve sa id bef ore. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Mr. Chairm an, I think this is a very good idea and I’d do it on a temporary basis. I agree with Cathy Minehan that it is an innovative approach and would show that we are trying to address a very im porta nt problem . Three or four years ago I went to a conference of central bankers and this idea of central banks engaging in options activ ities wa s discuss ed. This was not related to Y2K but was just a d iscussion of the general concept, and I ac tually commented on a paper on it at that tim e. I am just curious as to whether any other central banks are doing th is or even considering it at this tim e. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I’m not aware of any that are using this in their m anage ment of domestic interest rates. I know the ECB has made a point of saying that they have the author ity to use all ins truments; if  they want to use options and other derivatives they can. They have often stated that they have the full arsenal of weapons if they need it. A number of central banks use options in their investm ent activ ities in f oreign currencies, in m anaging 8/24/99 31 their foreign  curren cy reserves and lim iting the risks. The Bank of Mexico uses a nonsymmetric option in its intervention stra tegy. That is, when they’re accum ulating reserv es they do it th rough an option  that avo ids having their operations  exert an im pact on the day’s price. In other words, it is always  backward looking. When the exchange rate streng thens, they accum ulate a few reserves. The bank’s exercise of option s is one-sided. I domestic interest rate m anagem ent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. Actually, Mike Moskow already asked the first half of m y question. The second half is--and given your answer to Mike, I’m  not saying it’s necessa rily a bad thing --whether th ere is any risk that we' re going to be th e insuran ce provider of last resort for the whole world if other central banks don’t do som ething like this? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I think there is that risk today in our m oney m arket, which is why we’re proposing these extraordinary m easures. As I alluded to earlier, the Bank of Japan wants to find ways to be sure it can take U.S. Treasuries as co llateral whe n they lend yen to their banks. European banks and others are doi ng the sam e thing. The world is focusing on our m oney m arkets and financing markets as th eir adjustm ent mechanism. I think tha t’s where som e of the pressu res are com ing from  that we’re seeing. So, yes, if we’re trying to address our money m arket problem s, I think ther e is a r isk th at the benefits and the dem ands will spread beyond our nation ’s markets. But th at’s the reality we confront to beg in with, so I don’t think we can do anything about it. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. What would be the im plications of that? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I didn’t m ean to say it should be viewed as a risk. It may be good that somebody i n this whole world is going to do this. But these are the im plications. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, an obvious question arises here. Is there a lim it to the num ber and volu me of op tions you’ll b e willing to sell? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. That is even m ore challengi ng than the reservation price. My guess is that we will go out with a proposal o f $200 b illion, as I suggested, telling the m arket that with the Committee’s revi ew and approval we might raise th at lim it if we saw a demand. I would try to go out with a progr am involving a lim ited num ber of contracts per day and tell 8/24/99 32 them  they should price accordingly, but give them notice that there’s a risk that the quantity could be raised if we saw the dem and. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. If yo u price a ppropriately, you’ll ge t as large a volum e as you want. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. There’s an inte raction of lim its and pricing. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. The d esire to create a very low price m ay not be the wisest of all operations. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. As I say, it should be low enough so that we are m aking insurance available to the m arket to calm  it down but high enough to provide som e constraint on demand. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. It’s called subsidized insurance. That’s w hat it is. The fact is that they can get it from  the private sector but the price they w ould pay would em barrass the seller of the insura nce. The difference is the subsidy. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Exactly. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. It’s the sovereign credit of the United States. It is like the FDIC; it is prec isely the sam e issue. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. We seem to  be learning a lot. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. The question is what they ar e going to charg e their custo mers for this. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It would beat the subsidy. 

[SECTION]

MR STERN. The subsidy is going to get smaller the further out the chain one goes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Gary, that m ay well be the type of thing that Tom Hoenig is concerned about. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. It’s m y recollection that th e pub lication of  the prim ary dealer lis t is a consequence of the New York Fed asking the d ealers to repo rt to us the ir inter-d ealer transactions.  The dealers said, in effect, “W e’d love to report  our inter-d ealer tran sactions; you just have to tell us w ho the other dealers are.” And that is how  we got backed into having a list. It has a lready occur red to m e that we will want to ask the d ealers--“ask ” politely--to report to us seconda ry market transactions on sim ilar contracts so we can keep track of the pricing. 8/24/99 33 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. My guess is that as we have these discussions the notion of how high the price should be w ill co ntinue to go up. We don’t want the subsidy to be too low or too high. Whatever it is, what we want is-­

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Once the m oney is  available, it’s im possible to trace it to individual contracts or relations hips. So, in effect, it will be hard to see how the subsidy gets passed on. I guess every econom ist would say that the subsidy st ays with the dealer. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. It is with that in m ind, though my plans are a little in choate, that I have thought of auction ing set am ounts each day. That way there will be a p rice today, bu t more will be com ing online to morrow and more  will be  com ing online the nex t day. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If you have an  auction, basically you have not solved the problem  but you’ve lim ited it. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, precisely. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. With a lim it they will b id up the p rice, dependin g on how they think they can turn this onto their customers.  That will tend to reduce the subsidy. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. In fact, the p rice will tell u s something ab out how the program  is going in the m arket. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Absolutely. That is anot her reason daily auctioning som ehow seem s preferable to  me. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I had the im pression that you were think ing of setting the price. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. No, I mean to set a m inimum price. We don’t want people to put in a bid of zero or $1 at the auction. We’d have a minimum or reservation price and they would bid upward from  there. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Is there a reservation price on Treas ury bill auctions? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I don’t think so. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No?  The que stion is: Why would you want one on this? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Because we are uncertain a bout the supply--whether we are going to provide an unlim ited supply. That is, we haven’t yet figured out-­

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. But t hat reservation price doesn’t help you for that. It is the wrong side of the question; that’s all I’m  saying. 8/24/99 34 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I just m ean that we are talk ing about a reservation price because we are uncertain about whether we are going to set an upside lim it on the supply and, if so, where. Those are two ways of talking about the sam e thing. I am agreeing with you, I think, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. If it turns out th at indeed the dem and is very low or they set a very low price, you’d be  required to give it to them  at a negligible price, and that 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Peter, if we are ready fo r a m ore nuts and bolts type question here, I’m wondering about the tim ing of this. It seem s to me highly desirable, if we are going to do this, to do it as rapidly as possible. But ther e is a lot of work to do. How is this going to flow as far as the tim ing is concerned for these inquiries, preparations, announcem ents, putting it in place, and s o forth? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I alluded to the tim ing--probably too briefly--in my memo of August 17. I believe it is very important for us to work with the custody banks, BONY and Chase, before we go public, so we can set a reasonabl e date certain on when we could begin tri­party operations. We would propose to be gin imm ediately, tom orrow morning, working with the two clearing banks in th e hope that over the next busi ness week and a half we could resolve the various issues. Then we would be in a position shortly after L abor Day to announce at least a date certain. My hope is that by the first full week of October--for the reserv e managem ent needs I m entioned ear lier--we will be laying in the 90-day RPs so that we could begin tri-party operations  in the broader collateral pool then. Now, that’s m y hope. We want to work out som e of the nuts a nd bolts details with the clearing banks so we can announce with certainty that we will be do ing tri-party o perations, us ing the co llateral pool, and doing 90-day repos. So, a day or two after Labor Day, we certa inly will be announcing that we have the authority. We would begin working with th e senior leaders am ong the dealers about the same time we would be m aking public that we have this autho rity and plan to offer these options. We would be developing the details w ith the dealers, and I would hope to be able to conduct the auctions on the m odels I’m  roughly thinking of, if not by the first full week of October, by the m iddle of October. That would give us roughly two months of 8/24/99 35 auction ing until we ge t to the per iod when thes e options a re likely to be e xercis ed by the dealers in th e last two weeks of Decem ber. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. If you can m eet that tim etable , that would be excel lent. I think it is pretty am bitious, but we need  to try to do it that way. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. We envision having the meeting with th e heads of the firm s on the W ednesday after Labor Day. The reason we don’t want to do it before then is that we won’t be fini shed arranging for the tri-party ag reem ents with the ag ent banks and also because this is the tim e of year when too m any people are away . 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further questions for Peter?  Why don’t you read the Authoriza tion as it is being am ended? 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD. This would involve an addition to the Dom estic Authorization, paragraph 4, as described in Don Kohn’s m emo, which was circulated overnight. The new paragraph is: “In order to help ensure th e effective conduct of open m arket operations during th e transition period surrounding the cen tury date chan ge, the Comm ittee autho rizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to sell o ptions on repurchase agreem ents, reverse repurch ase agreem ents and m atched sale purchas e trans action s for exercis e no later th an

Life is going to  get m essy; these likely will be ex traordinary tim es. But this k ind of extraor dinary think ing and extraordinary planning really shows that the Federal Reserve can operate not just in ordinary tim es but in extraordinary tim es. My confidence level in our ability to  deal with all of these poten tial problem s has gone up as a result of this conversation, in large part due to you, Peter, and your associates.

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. At first blush, it m ight seem  odd that in this edition of the Greenbook we’d be talking about heightened inflation risks and ra ising the assum ed fed funds pa th in our baseline forecast.  After all, real GDP growth was surprisingly weak in the second quarter, and the core CPI increased only a tenth-and-a-half per m onth on average in June and July. Given that you’ve all perused th e text, I’m  sure that you appreciate the com pelling logic that lay behind our forecast revisions! [Laughter] But, just for the record, Karen and I shall highlight for you som e of the key considerations. Because a signif icant p art of the explanation com es from  the international side--and because som e interesting developm ents have occurred in that sphere in the post-Greenbook publication period-­Karen will lead of f. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON. There are two elem ents of the  external picture that I believe need to be highlighted this  morning. One is the shift in our thinking toward the view  that r ecovery am ong ma ny of the crisis countries has taken hold; our outlook for output growth abroad for the rest of this year and next year is now stronger than we previously thought. This m ore optim istic tone is present in the Greenbook, but I think it m erits som e comm ent, including som e cautions. Second, since the Greenbo ok forecast was finalized, we have received the trade data for would shade our forecas t of the external sector ju st a bit from  that in the Greenbook as a consequence. Additional data showing very st rong real output growth in several developing countries have convinced us  that activity in som e of these countries is rebounding shar ply from the depressed levels reached last year. For several im portant As ian econom ies, including Korea and Malays ia, we have raised our estim ates of the level of output reached in the second q uarter and h ave extrapolat ed firm er growth over the forecast period. There have been  positiv e surprises with respect to so me Latin American countries as well, in partic ular Mexico and Brazil, and we have revised upw ard the average growth we  expect for that region but less adjustm ents im ply output growth for developing countries that is 3/4 percentage point stronger at an annual rate during the second half of this year and a percentage point stronger next year than we had in June. Although we now read the signs of recovery in m any emerging econom ies as m ore persuasive, downside risks rem ain that should not be 8/24/99 37 underestim ated. In Asia, the econo mic and political situatio n in China is clouded. With output grow th slowing and deflation continuing, m arket talk of an im minent devaluation of  the currency h as resum ed. We are antic ipating a gradua l decline in the nominal value of the renm inbi during next year. If, instead, there is an ab rupt adjustm ent, financial stresses for other econom ies in the region could result. Given China’s substantial holdings of international reserv es and  capital con trols, we believe that officials are in a position to m anage this decision, but we cannot rule out that circum stances could force their hand. Downward pressure on the Brazilia n real over the past four weeks appears to be a sign of heightened market concern. Despite very strong real GDP perform ance in the first half  of the year, progress on perm anent fiscal reform is questionable, with  both court challenges and political comm itment continuing to pose problem s. The governm ent of Brazil has struggled to norm alize access to g lobal financial m arkets: The agreem ent of Brazil with its m ajor bank cred itors to m aintain their lend ing positio ns is about to expire, and B razilian au thorities have announced that they have no plans to draw on the third tranche of their IMF or bilateral support funds. However, with the ex ternal accoun ts still in def icit, Brazil is dependent on attracting foreign capital; a further loss of  market confidence could trigger a swif t resu mption of  contractionary forces. Financial markets in Latin Am erica ar e generally som ewhat skittish. The recen t anno uncem ent by Ecuador th at it m ay miss a paym ent due shortly on its outstanding Brady bonds had a moderate ef fect on spreads elsewher e in Latin Am erica and cou ld lead to f urther vo latility if  talks with the IMF m ake no progress. Although we see the situation in so me parts of the global econom y as still f ragile, the over all picture is non etheless con siderab ly brighter than in June. With the sign ificant pos itive revis ion to the forecast f or output in the developing countries and a sm all upward adjustm ent to that in the foreign industrial countries, we have  output abroad growing at 3 percent over the forecast period, about  the sam e as forecast for the United States. Stronger growth abroad should boost e xports som e, and we have raised their projected growth accordingly. The nom inal trade d eficit in June, which was relea sed after the Greenbook forecast was final, reveal ed sligh tly more exports and significantly m ore im ports than we had incorporated into the second-quarter estim ate. All categories of  imports were buoyant, and no special factors or s tatistical ano malies seem present. We are inclined to adjus t the level of imports--and exports--in the second quarte r, but to retain our path for quarterly growth rates ov er the forecast period. The higher level of imports in June im plies that th e negative contribution of net exports remained substantial in the second qu arter. Going forward, with foreign 8/24/99 38 output grow th solid, and the path for the real exch ange value o f the dollar trending down slightly, as we ha ve in our forecast, the negative contribution of real net exports should dim inish. The positive surprise to imports of  capital goods in June suggests that the level of PDE in the advance seco nd-quarter release should be revised up som ewhat. Taken together, thes e data revisions im ply an annual growth rate of 1.5 percent for seco nd-quarter G DP, com pared with 1.9 percen t in th e advance release. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Even with the revision to  net exports, the biggest surprise in the second-quarter G DP picture, re lative to our last projection, still is the very low rate of inventory accumu lation. A forecaster’s fairly typical response to such a surprise, especia lly when it occurs against a backdrop of solid final dem and, would be to as sume that the shortfall will tran slate into add itional impetus to subsequen t output g rowth, as f irms seek to bring their stocks back into norm al alignm ent with  expected sales. Unfortunately, however, one m ust judge just what the norm al alignm ent is; and that is som ething that can shift over tim e in response, am ong other things, to changes in pric e expectations or interest rates, or structural improve ments in “supply-chain m anagem ent.” In the present case, the persis tent--and now sizable--d ecline in the aggregate inventory/sales ratio in recent quarters and the lack of evidence that this is causing any discom fort have caused us to reassess our judgm ent about firm s’ objectives for stocks. In essence, we’re putting considerable weight on the stru ctural im prove ment story and, consequently, we’re not looking for any m eaningful rebound in the stock-sales ratio. But, on the a ssum ption that f irms will not se ek still lowe r ratios in the near f uture, we still get a step-up in inventor y investm ent that makes a positiv e contrib ution to GDP growth sim ilar to what we had in our previou s forecast. So, in addressing the question of where our heightened inflation risk came from, inventories are not the answ er. Nor, of course, is it from recen t dom estic finan cial m arket developm ents. Indeed, thou gh we’d been expecting that the m arkets would be afflicted with Y2K anxieties, we didn’t an ticipate tha t the f ears wo uld exert the force they apparently have so far before the end of the y ear. To be su re, the recen t backup in interest rates  didn’t arise solely b ecause of antic ipated Y2K pressures ; concerns about m onetary policy tight ening contributed as well. But it seem s quite clear, as has already been noted this morning, that the concern that m arket liquidity would dry up later this year gave rise to pressures on an array of rate sp reads for which there were no t the arbitrage res ources av ailable to offset fully. 8/24/99 39 The further rise in longer-term interest rates--especially those on home mortgages--should exert som e additional restraining force on domestic dem and in the com ing m onths. But we antic ipate th at the spread widening, which already has reversed som e this m onth, will reverse m ore fully once we’ve negotia ted the century date change. This is one reason we’ve a ssum ed another 50 basis points of tightening by next spring. All else e qual, if the S ystem  failed to validate the m arket’s  expectation of at leas t that much firm ing in short rates, the tendency probably would be for corpor ate bond yields and mortgage rates to drop back even m ore than we’ve anticipated. Moreover, the absence of tightening could well provide the al l-clear signal that would help the stock m arket to extend its uptrend. The rally of the past few days, as the underscores that risk. The final point I’d m ake on the domestic dem and side is that the outlook for the federal budget has turn ed a tad more stim ulative for the coming quarters, with the addition of about $20 billion of outlays for the coming fisc al year that was not antic ipated in our previous projection. Obviously, this am ount isn’t a big deal in a $9 trillion econom y, but it comes on top of the additional im petus expected from  export dem and. So, on balance, aggregate dem and growth prospects--even with a notch m ore nom inal m onetary tighteni ng--look to us to be at least as strong for the com ing year or so as they did at the tim e of the last meeting. But our inflation concerns stem  also from  the supply side, where there are ind icatio ns that cost  pressures are m ounting to a greater degree than we’d perceived before. All the recent wage readings have surpassed our expectations, som e by quite substantial m argins. Adm ittedly, all the m easures have th eir lim itatio ns as rep resentations of the cos t elem ents that m ight be in fluencing short-run pricing behavior, but it would seem  wrong to discount them  entirely as factors that could contribute to larger increases in the prices of goods and services. In addition, recen t news on crude and interm ediate m aterials prices has been disappointing, with the increas es in the core PPI m easures as well as in oil prices pointing to m ore pipeline inflation. We don’t expect that either of these will provide a m ajor jolt to core inflation, but the picture is less favorable at this po int than we thought it would be. The prospect tha t the recen t weakness of  the dollar w ill foster an earlier upturn in non-oil im port prices  reinforces th at con cern. All told, the n, we f elt that a m odest elevation of our wage and price inflation forecasts was appropriate, and the 25 basis poin ts of additional fed funds increase that we tacked on did little more than keep the real 8/24/99 40 short- term interes t rate path as h igh as it was las t time. Clearly, if  the recen t sink ing spell of the dollar co ntinues, the alternative 1 0 percen t depreciation sim ulation in the Greenbook potentially com es into play, and the inflation problem could be significantly intensified. We didn’t se e that as the most lik ely outcom e, but as a quite clear risk that is worthy of your attention. To put it in term s of an overused fairy tale analogy, it could well be that Goldilocks, the international investor, has pretty much gotten h er fill of  U.S. dolla r porr idge--be it ho t, cold, o r just right--and has begun to develop an  appetite for som e Kobe beef or Euro truffles. That concludes our prepared rem arks, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Ques tions for Mike or Karen? 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. I have a couple of questions , Mike, on dif ferent topics. First, on inventories, your rem arks this m orning as well as what I read in the Greenbook surprised m e a bit by sug gesting that there is a lack of an ecdotal reports on inve ntory problem s. We’ve all been reporting on certain shortages, for ex ample that there are no 2x4s around and so on. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Drywall and som e other cons truction supplies certainly would be the exception. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. We had noted in our Beigeboo k report tha t in the au to sector cer tain models sim ply aren’t available. So my staff looked at the Beigebook reports of other Reserve Banks, and a couple of them also cited drains from  retail inventories. One of m y directors reports to us regular ly abou t the reta il sector, and he has been saying for a few months that m ajor retailers are increasingly worried that their e fforts to build stock are being aborted by those darn consum ers who keep cleari ng out their shelves! He believes retailers are going into the year-end period with signifi cantly less inventory th an they wanted. I always th ink that m eans they are inev itably going to overshoot, as they find them selves trying to catch up to som e level and m iss it. So I was just w ondering how confident you are that you’ve got the picture right on inventory. It seem s to me a sign ificant risk to th e forecast. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I don’t think one can ever have confidence in an inventory forecast, and I certain ly don’t at this mom ent. We are con scious of som e areas in wh ich it is likely that firms would want to build stocks. I’m not sure  that’s the case in retailing on a broad front, but it certainly would be true in  many areas of building supplies . There are still industries, 8/24/99 41 by all reports, with m ore inventories than firm s would like to have--construction equipm ent, farm equipm ent, che micals still to som e degree,  and so on. Our sense is that if there are cases where inventories are leaner than desi red, it is not a pervasive phenom enon. If one looks at survey evidence--for exam ple, the purchasing m anagers’ repor ts on perceptions of custom er inventories--nothing has happened recently to suggest that firm s in general have been greatly surprised by the st rength of sales and that their inventories have been depleted beyond levels they would be happy to live wi th. Going forward, we are expecting a substantial step-up in inventor y accumulation, augm ented over th e rem ainder of this year by some Y2K hoarding. So we do have a subs tantial contribution to GDP growth from inventory investm ent over the next severa l months. We are hopeful that with the cooperation of the Reserve Bank res earch s taffs we will be able to com e up with a little more concre te notion of  just how big  the Y2K inventory hoa rding ef fort will be, and we will report on that before the next m eeting. That’s certainly a wild card in the picture. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. The other question relates to inflation, anticipating that at our October meeting you are going to  give us a first look at yo ur forecast for 2001. As I look at this Greenbook forecast, which goes out to the four th quarter of 2000, your forecast for th e CPI excluding energy seem s to be on a track that will produce a num ber over 3 percent in 2001. Am I right about that? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I think we’d edge above the 3 percent m ark in core inflation on the assum ption that the unemploym ent rate will be  drifting up ever so slightly as we m ove through 2001. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mike, given the su rprisingly strong growth of  incom e, profits, and also tax receip ts in recen t years, can we draw any inferences abou t what we m ight see with the productivity? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. We have som e bits and  pieces of information from  various censuses an d some notion about what the reports f rom the unemploym ent insurance system  are suggesting about revisions to wage and salary incom e. On both sides of the ledger, the inform ation points to upward revisions in th e level of GDP this year. I should caution though that this is fragm entary . There will also be som e change s in the scope of  GDP, in a sense, as th ey 8/24/99 42 introduce computer software; what  the year-to-year growth patte rn will be there, one cannot be sure. Even on the compensation side, we really only have inform ation about one very important component of com pensation--wage and salary incom e. There is still the possibility that other labor incom e could be re vised in ways that would alter the picture. Based on what we know, we’d anticipate that we  are not talking about more than a couple of tenths on the current definition of GDP in te rms of what the higher trend output growth might have been over recent years. That’s so rt of the upside lim it based on the fragmentary inform ation we have at this point. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I can offer a little, but not m uch, insight into the Y2K inventory issue. My contact at UPS says that for its own pla nning purposes his com pany has been surveying its top 300 shippers. We are going to get m ore infor mation on this survey before too long, but at this p oint he cou ld share with  me that their shippers ex pect som e acceleration of shipm ents bef ore the tu rn of the year  when it is feasible to do so. As a consequence, UPS is going to hav e a sm aller c utback in its  capacity in  that period than usual.  Ordinarily, starting pretty m uch on Christm as day, they cut back capacity by a bout They are going to cut back by and then m ake their norm al seasonal reductions. That is all I have at  this point on their survey results, but m y contac t will provide m e with m ore detailed inf ormation later. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Furthe r questions for our colleagues?  If not, who would like to start the Comm ittee roundtable discussion?  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an. Econom ic growth in New England remains about the sam e as it has been for so me months. Employm ent is expanding at a bit above what could be considered a norm al rate  for the region and unem ploym ent rates in all six states are quite low. In fact, New Ha mpshire is one of onl y a few states in the country with an une mploym ent rate b elow 3  percen t, and the ra tes in Connectic ut and Massachusetts are close to that level as well. The regiona l labor force grew by a bout 1 percent during the first half of the year versus  the sam e period in 1998, as opposed to a decline in 1998 versus 1997. And labor force participation rem ains above  that for the United States as a whole. 8/24/99 43 Thus, there m ay be reasons for less concern that the lack of availability  of labor will be a deterrent to regional growth. Contacts continue to report average wage increases in the range of 3 to 5 percent notwithstanding tight labor m arkets. As I’ve noted  before, there is a wider use of flexible or perform ance-based pay increases, as well as non-monetary incentives such as increased training for staff. Recently, we’ve also noticed that som e firms are us ing p ay strateg ies that seem  particularly unsustainable for the longer run. For exam ple, one firm  noted that it was attracting new hires with a com bination of  signing bonuses, perform ance sharing, stock options, and relocation packages, while existi ng employees were getting sm all or no wage increases. This would not work at a Reserve Bank for very long and I doubt it is going to work there e ither! Regional price growth has recently been m oderate. The July data now show prices in the Boston area, as m easured by the CPI, growi ng at a pace som ewhat faster than the nation in alm ost all catego ries. In particu lar, m edical  costs are growing at be tter than a 4 percent pace. Despite these CPI data, region al contacts still repo rt very litt le pricing power, given the com petitive nature of the econom y. There continues to be a real effort to im prove productivity and to control the cost of i nputs by m anaging suppliers’ prices-- “à la W al-lack of supply and a shortage of construction workers and building supplies. Not surprisingly, the prices of new and existing hom es for sale rose at a ra te above that for the nation as a whole. Reportedly, some of this increase also ref lects high dem and for expensive second hom es in the region. Looking forward, m easures of state business confidence and consum er confidence are very high. New England consum ers apparently continue to view  current conditions as either as good as it gets or perhaps too good to last, si nce the future expectations com ponent of the confidence index is lower than the measure of current conditions. Finally, business confidence is close to an all-tim e high and has not been near current levels since early 1998. Manufacturing as well as nonm anufacturing indust ries report strong confidence on both the current and the future basis. One very in teresting  side comm ent in our con tacts with manufacturers this m onth was their perspec tive on inventory building for Y2K. Seve ral mentioned that they saw few problem s with domestic suppliers but were concerned about 8/24/99 44 foreign sources. Thus, they expected to build inventories largely in the form  of imports. Perhaps if this tendency is widespread, it coul d begin to account for som e of the unexpected worsening in the trade deficit in recent m onths. On the national scene, we are largely in agreem ent with the Greenbook forecast. We view the second-quarter slowdow n as an aberration, not the be ginning of a trend, and see the rest of the year and 2000 m uch along the same lines as the G reenbook. As I’ve noted before, we see a bit m ore inflation risk, largely driven by wage costs, which do seem  to be turning up a bit- -whethe r in th e latest ECI data, av erage hou rly earnings, or the purchasing managers’ data. Moreov er, I am  not as sanguine as is th e Greenbook about the recen t increase in oil prices backing off in 2000. Last week I attend ed a conference th at invo lved public and p rivate sec tor participan ts from  a variety of areas around the w orld. One CEO of a m ajor foreign oil com pany and a senior inves tment banker specializing  in trad ing comm odities spoke about  their expectations for oil pr ices. Both belie ve that n either Brent nor West Texas Interm ediate  prices are likely to back off much from  current levels  in 2000 and  could overs hoot a bit before falling back as the year-end approaches. They regard current levels as not ideal for producers, but as reflective of a balance between  providing sufficient incom e for the m ajor current suppliers while not enough to attract new high-cost prov iders. The m ain concern they cited was managing production to adapt to expected furt her increases in world dem and while keeping prices relatively stable. Thus, I think we are seeing the gradual unw inding of m any of th e tem porary facto rs that have contributed to the econom y’s extend ed period of success. World growth is accelerating,  commodity prices ar e increasing, the dollar is m ore likely to weaken, and  wage costs are growing. To be sure, continued productivity growth helps, and overall m easures of inflation have not yet accelerated. But the need to be proactiv e and forward thinking remains. It is true, as we discussed earlier,  that f inancia l markets have been fragile and volatile of late. Nevertheless, som e wide ning of spreads is not unhealthy nor is a moderation in the continuing upw ard trend in stock m arket indices and P E ratios--though, given yesterday’s m arket behavior, one wonders  if that actually has happened. One antidote to this volatility, however, m ay well be a grea ter certainty ab out the stance of Fed policy in 8/24/99 45 the short run, both our stance with  respect to inte rest rates an d our stance with regard to Y2K. Finally, one keeps hearing comments about even the sm all amount of tightening in monetary policy we’ve implem ented already or may be contem plating as being anti-growth. Certainly, I’ve heard it from  my own directors.  However, there is good reason to believe that p roactiv e monetary policy --monetary po licy that an ticipates rather than waits f or inflation to occur--is m ore s upportive of stable growth than the alternative of potentially letting inflation get out of hand. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s go to President Moskow  and then we’ll break for coffee. I see som e heads nodding. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Seventh District econom y continues to expand at a moderate  pace, with tight labor m arkets increasingly being cited as a factor constraining growth. Activity in the motor vehicle industry rem ains a key source of strength in the District. Indus try contacts continue to expect 1999 to be a record high year for sales of both light vehicles and heavy-duty trucks. The CEO of a m ajor autom aker told me that one reason is that the affordability of light vehicles is at a 35-year high. Elsew here, manufacturing conditions are still m ixed. But based on purchasing m anagers’ surveys from across the District, overall activ ity is expanding. For exam ple, the Chicago Purchasing Managers ’ Report for August, which  I’ll cau tion will not b e releas ed to th e public un til a week from  today, will s how continu ed expansio n but at a so mewhat slo wer pace th an in survey for August also showed the prices paid  component at above 50 percent for the sixth consecutive month and at the highest le vel in m ore than four years. In term s of specific industries, som e gyps um wallboard producers are delaying norm al maintenance in order to keep running overall at 100 percent of capacit y. The steel industry continues to show im provem ent as the im port-related inventory overhang is worked down. On the other hand, construction equipm ent shows a few signs of slowing, and farm equipm ent m akers have trimm ed production plans again. For one m ajor far m equipm ent producer in our District output this year is expected to be  down 30 to 40 percent from last year, and that seem s to be representative of  the industry. There is no doubt that some farmers have been adversely im pacted by low co mmodity prices. Ironically, it is possible 8/24/99 46 that ne t cash  farm income could be a t a reco rd high level this year if  the a ddition al farm subsidy package being considered in Congress is enacted and if funds  are disbursed this year. As all of us have been reporting for a long tim e, labor m arkets are very tight. The rate of une mploym ent for our  five-state area fell b ack to 3.5 percent in July, after having moved up to 3.7 percent in May and June. Actually, t hough, four of our five states were below  3.5 percen t in Ju ly. The exc eption was I llinois wher e we’ve see n a rath er sh arp inc rease in the unem ployment rate recently from  3.9 percent in April to 4.6 pe rcent in June and July. An econom ist at the state em ploym ent agency did not view the increase as a sign of weakness but ra ther a ttributed it to a surge in th e labor force, particularly reen trants who had been out of the work force for over a year. There has been a pickup in dem and for tem porary industrial workers, according to  my contacts at Manpower. In addition, Manpower’s latest survey results, which won’t be releas ed pub licly until n ext M onday, show hiring p lans for the fourth quarter to be very strong again. What is not clear, though, is whether all these jobs will be f illed. Increasingly, contacts a re reporting that lab or shortages are cons training business activity, either in the form  of scaled -back expansion plans or business lost because of the inability to fully staff current activiti es. This is a widespread phenom enon in our District, with such reports com ing from  home builders and other construction firm s, retailers, dining establishm ents, te mporary help firm s, and trucking firm s just to nam e a few. Turning to the national econom y, our outlook is reasonably sim ilar to that contained in the Greenbook though we, like Cathy Minehan, remain slightly m ore pessim istic about inflation next year. Data received since our  last m eeting continue to sug gest th at the econom y will gradually return to tr end growth rates. However, th is moderation in g rowth is not likely to be enough to alleviate increasing inflationary pressure s. Indeed, the recent data on wages, the further increase in oil prices, the rise in other comm odity prices, and the weakness of the dollar all suggest less optim ism about cost pressures in the m onths ahead. Meanwhile, the factors that have been drivi ng the recen t rapid expansion o f dem and--high levels of wealth, confide nce, and inc ome grow th--rem ain with us. It app ears unlike ly that the policy adjustm ent we m ade last tim e will be enough to significantly lessen the ris k of increasing inflation. Without som e further adjustm ents, we risk the kinds of i mbalances that would endanger the econom ic expa nsion. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. 8/24/99 47

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, the Twelfth Di strict econom y has expanded at a solid pace so far this year, although the disparity acro ss states has increase d. District payro lls expanded at a 2.4 percent rate dur ing the first seven m onths of the year, down from  the 3.1 percent pace of 1998. Employm ent growth rate s in the fastest growing states--Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah--ave raged between 2.5 and 4.2 percent.  In five other District states--Alaska, Idaho, Hawaii, Oregon, and W ashington--employm ent expanded at or below the national pace. Despite slower ov erall gr owth,  District lab or markets rem ain tight. Construction and services as well as transp ortation, communication, and public utilities have continued to be the strongest sectors of the District’s economy. In contrast, District m anufacturing p ayrolls  have declin ed at a 1.6 percen t pace th is year. Employm ent reductions have occurred in  both the durable and nondurable sectors. In the durable sector reductions have been broad-based, althoug h em ploym ent has declined most rapidly in the aircraft and resources-rel ated industries. In the state of W ashington, Boeing and its suppliers have cut 11,000 jobs si nce last December. In the nondurable sector weak dem and for agricu ltural comm odities ha s continued to dam p employm ent growth in the food-processing industry. During the past few years, prices and prof its of agricu ltural p roducers in the Twelfth District have been held down by we ak export demand caused by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and the econom ic crisis in Asia. Distri ct exports of agricult ural products fell by nearly 20 percent between 1997 and 1998, and data for Calif ornia suggest that agricultural exports have continued to decline in 1999. As a result, gross sales and net far m income in the District have fallen. Howe ver, relative to other areas of the United S tates, District agricultural producers ar e in reasonably good shape since only a sm all percentage of the District’s production is in the bulk comm odities experiencin g the larges t price d eclin es. Turning to the national econom y, from 1995 to 1998 core price inflation m easures, even on consistently m easured bases, genera lly were trending downward. This decline probably reflected favorable supply shocks that more than outweighed strong dem and. However, several special factor s helped out as well. Since mid-1998 this disinflation has 8/24/99 48 stalled. Price inflation and surv ey expectations of future infl ation appear to have flattened out. This halt in the progress toward our goal of  price stability sounds a cautionary note in assess ing th e current s tance of po licy. This is p articula rly true given the context of tight labor m arkets and our forecast, which  predicts strong output g rowth throu gh the rest o f this year and steady to slightly rising core inflat ion through next year. Such a path does not continue the gains that w e have m ade toward price stability during the past few years and We have exam ined a variety of risks to th is outlook, som e of whic h are sim ilar to the alternative scenarios in the Gr eenbook. In one alternative no t covered in the Greenbook, the favorable supply conditions of the recent pa st are assum ed to dissipate by lowering underlying trend productivity growth for the fo recast period f rom 2¼ to 1¼ percent. In 2000, real growth slows by ½ percentage point and inflation begins to ac celerate. I believe this scenario dem onstrates that an unwinding of the positive productivity shock poses a risk to our recent progress toward  price stability. Thank you.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, we have not  had a lot of change in our District since the last m eeting. To jum p to the bottom line, with one exception I’ll m ention in just a minute, we see relatively  few signs of any deceler ation in activity in ou r region. At th e last meeting, I reported that consum er spending had been especially robust in May and June, and all reports suggest that that is  continuing. Car sales rem ain at an exceptionally high level. One of our bank directors recen tly to ld us  that new car loans at his b ank, were at an all-tim e high. This strong auto demand m ay soon be stim ulating som e addition al manufacturing activity in our Di strict, which generall y is already fairly strong. As you m ay know, BM W has a big new plant in Greenville, S outh Carolina. As I’m  sure Jack G uynn is aware, people down there like to  say that in South Carolina B MW stands for Bubba Makes Wheels! [Laughter] Anyway, that is a big plant and they’ve a nnounced plans for a $650 million expa nsion in pa rt to m ake sports utility ve hicle s at that plant to m eet the strong demand for those vehicles. Elsewhere, construction is th e sector in our region wher e imbalances and b ottlenecks are m ost apparent. Skilled construction workers are still in v ery shor t supply. We hear lots of anecdotal reports about pay increases and sp ecial bonuses for that particular category of 8/24/99 49 labor, which seem s consistent with what Mike  Moskow was saying about wages generally. Materials are also in short s upply. I heard a report from one our directors that som ebody had hijacked a truckload of dr ywall som ewhere in Maryland! [Laughter] So we really do have som e of those kinds  of condition s. And I think that s ituation r eflects continued v ery strong dem and for housing in our District, despit e the recent increases in mortgage rates--o r seen a num ber of reports  recen tly of a quick er pace of price increas es for both new and existing hom es. The two weak spots in o ur District are still te xtiles and agriculture. As I am sure m ost of you are aware, our farm ers are suffering from  what m ay be the worst drought in the last half century in this part of the country. The problem s for far mers, of course, have been exacerb ated by the low p rices world wide for agricultura l commodities. Also, I m ight just note that I got a call yesterday f rom  who runs a rather big furniture com pany in North Carolina. He said that his business had fallen off fairly noticeab ly over the last 90 d ays or s o, so  I thought I should report that. But th at is really an outlier. With th at exception, we don’t see m any signs of a slowing in overall activity at the regional level. We don’t see m any signs at the national le vel either. The Greenbook points out that the widening U.S. current account deficit coul d produce a sizable deprec iation of the dollar, with poten tially inf lationary im plica tions. I think it’s also p ossible th at som e of our m ajor trading partners could ease their m onetary po licies going forward to prev ent their cu rrencies from  appreciating, which could stimulate fore ign growth perhaps even beyond what is now anticipated. Either of  those developm ents could increase  U.S. net exports or at least moderate the rate of decline, with potentially inflationary consequences given the already tight labor m arket conditions  in th e United Sta tes. So it seem s to m e that the weight of the ri sk in the national outl ook is still skewed to the upside. At the sam e time, I would certain ly acknowledge that there are downside risks, specifically the possib ility that a sharp declin e in the sto ck market m ight scare consu mers and precipitate a sudden colla pse of confidence and spending. Obviously, we cannot rule out a sharp m arket correction. But even if one occurs, there are a few reasons for thinking that in the current situation the negative  impact of such an event on dem and and 8/24/99 50 employm ent could be contained. I’ll just m ention a couple of poi nts. First, back in 1987 I think we saw and learned that if we react quickly and appropriately we can  contain the downside impact of a m arket break. Also, we ar e talking h ere abou t wealth ef fects a nd it is worth keeping in m ind that physical capital cons titutes about 30 percent of aggregate wealth in the United States while hum an capital constitu tes about 70 percent. So if m onetary policy keeps the job m arket on track, I think workers can still have  reasonable confidence about their longer-term  incom e prospects, which w ould m oderate the negative effects on spending that m ight otherwise com e from  a market break. Finally, the situation is a bit less precarious p recisely becau se the Fed now has credib ility a nd is expec ted, I th ink quite generally in the m arkets,  to take the ac tions that ar e needed to co ntain inflation. Because of that, over the course o f this year at least, bond rates have been r ising well ah ead of  actual policy a ctions, prepar ing the m arket f or addition al restrain t and  in a sense creating a co ntinuity --maybe sm oothness would be a better word--of monetary policy. I think that can reduce th e likelihood of a really  sharp market break, though it doesn’t elim inate it. The bottom  line, Mr. Chairm an, is that wh ile there are downside risks in the outlook, at this poin t they seem  to m e still pre tty clearly outweighed by the upsid e risks and th e potentially c ostly inf lationary im plications of those upside risks.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Growth in the Sixth District rem ains healthy. Our regional econom y seems to be e xpanding at approxim ately the sam e rate as the nation at the current tim e, although I conti nue to expect som e slowing in housing. Residential construction is rela tively stronger than the nati onal num bers suggest, perhaps because the invento ry of available ho using uni ts rem ains low. Perm its are up even m ore strongly than in the nation. Reports of materials shortages and scarcities have pushed up housing prices and m ay act to dam p both dem and and supply growth somewhat. But the strong perm its data suggest that  this m ay be a temporary deve lopm ent. Regional industrial production was up, according to the latest Southeastern m anufact uring survey, hinting of the streng th in the nation al statistics. And while  shipm ents and new orders w ere off slightly, respondents indicated that pr oduction is expected to incr ease over the com ing months. Regional consum er confidence, as measured by the Florida Consum er Confidence survey, is 8/24/99 51 high; the index is only 2 points be low its all- time high of  last February. This is reflected in robust District retail sales. Prospects fo r the Christm as season look especially bright, gauging from the extrem ely strong buying report ed at the A tlanta Gift Mart Christm as Show, where both regional and national retailer s com e to do their looking and buying for the upcom ing Christm as season. I have been expecting som e pickup in the Gu lf Coast oil and gas industry. Based on a substantial run-up in crude pr ices and the lower extraction breakeven point now prevailing, one would have expected drilli ng to rebound. It still has not a nd we interpret that as saying that the dr illers ar e less confident tha n most econ omic forecasters that the  cartel’s production quotas and, consequently, pricing will hold. Long-term  prospects for that industry in our region just had a big boost from  BP-Am oco’s announcem ent last m onth of the larges t deep water find ever in th e Gulf, an  estim ated 1 billion barre ls of oil a m ile down and som e 124 m iles southeast of New Orleans. To rete ll an old f amiliar story, Dis trict labo r markets rem ain quite tight. Our regiona l year-over-year payroll growth of  2.6 percent is outpacing that of  the nation. The District unem ployment rate has now declined by anothe r 0.2 percentage point to 3.9 percent, and that rate is the lowest in som e 20 years. Howe ver, despite that tightne ss, we still see little evidence of general broad-based wage acceleratio n. Similarly , prices for raw m aterials  and finished goods also rem ain stable, with th e exception of prescripti on drugs and selected building m aterials, whose prices have increas ed, as others have already m entioned. Turning to the nation al pictu re, my inte rpretation  of the m ost recen t inco ming data, combined with anecdotal inform ation, is that the econom y is m aintaining substantial forward m omentum . Fundam entals of job grow th, incom e growth, and confidence rem ain quite favorable. The im proving econom ic outlo ok for the econom ies around the world that Karen Johnson talked about should begin to  spur exports. And the propensity of governm ent to increase spending m ay provide marginal stimulus in the period ahead. Although one can point to som e signs of slowing or potential slowing- -including the effects of higher mortgage rates on housing and related industries--I share the view that the sharp downturn in GDP growth in the second quarter will be revers ed in the current quarter and over the forecast period. 8/24/99 52 Of course, for us the cru cial qu estion  is whether the expected pace of gro wth can be sustained without increasing in flationary pressures. Our Bank’s own judgm ental forecast and our VAR m odeling work, like m ost other for ecasts, sugg est an upward drift in ex pected inflation of nearly 50 basis points next year  and som ewhat more beyond that. With som e humility, wh ich othe rs ha ve alr eady e xpressed in previous m eetings, I ack nowledge th at we have had su ch forecasts for som e time now, a nd m easured inflation has continued to defy those forecasts. So the difficult question for m e is what unde rpins those forecasts of higher inflation and how m uch confidence we should put in them this tim e around. After sorting through what seem s to be happening and pressuring m y own staff for evidence, I conclude that the probability of inflation trending upw ard is h igh enough, and higher than it has been, that we should continue to lean against it. For m e no one factor or developm ent makes that case. Rather, the cum ulative probability of pressure s from  various sources, in cluding the rev ersal of favorable commodity prices, the more pos itive outlook for Latin Am erican and Asian econom ies, the expected boost to U.S. exports, an d rising im port prices from  a decline in the value of the dollar, all po int in that d irection. I do not consid er myself a Philips curve devotee, but I think very tight  labor m arkets and a low unemp loym ent rate are a t least signaling th at policy rem ains som ewhat accommodative. Finally, I do not think w e should always feel compelled to validate financial m arket developm ents. But should we decide not to provide the m odest policy firm ing that is now widely expected and apparently priced into the market, we m ay lose som e of the m arket discip line an d caution th at is in play and instead  get a dose of  added stim ulus that we don’t want and don’t need. I see this as a u nique oppor tunity to take out som e addition al inflation insurance at little or no co st. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The e conom y in the Kansas City District remains quite healthy. It has slowed from the rather strong pace of last year but remains overall a very strong economy. Employm ent has improved m odestly, although the growth rates have slowed, but we  suspect that is as m uch a s upply issue as a dem and issue. Constructio n activ ity rem ains bris k; it’s down a bit from  the torrid pace o f last year b ut is still very strong, and we are con tinuing to see price pressures on resources in that industry. 8/24/99 53 Manufacturing activity rem ains subdued com pared  with past very high levels, but through our surveys we have picked up an obvious in crease in dem and for exports com ing from some of the im prove ments in Asia and South Am erica. Others have spoken of activity in the energy sector. In our Distri ct the rig count is up about 25 pe rcent from last April, but it is still about 25 percent below a year ago. Nevertheless, there is som e pickup in activity in that s ector. As for wages, there are wage pressures. They are not accelerating sharply, but we are now well aware of steady pressure on wages. Our labor m arkets are extrem ely tight and our unem ployment lev els are very low. Our particip ation rate is very high and that is af fecting our labor m arkets. I’ll share a bit of anecdotal inform ation on both sides of  this issue. In Colorado, contracted with 600  software engineers in In dia becau se the firm could not find anyone in their own area to do the job. In Kansas City, our m ajor construction com panies have im ported skilled w orkers generally and in pa rticular have hired brick layers and others in the highe r skilled pr ofessions f rom both Canada  and Mexico  to fill a crying need. In fact, we have found in ta lking with school distri cts throughout the region that they are having a problem  replacing m ath and science teachers w ho are being re cruited and hired away by private industry . On the other side, we had an interesting discussion with one of the major accounting firm s, which ha s changed its accounting and operations system s to bring autom ation into its work papers and analysis. The firm is counting on productivity improve ments to the extent that it is actu ally budgeting for the im prove ments by budgeting down the number of  people it will b ring on board . That’s a f airly risky po sition on the ir part but they really are lookin g for som e productivity improvem ents because th ey are pay ing very high prem iums for professional help. I will talk ju st briefly ab out our farm ec onom y. I know that the Northeas t and East more generally are in a drought. That is not th e case in our area. We are expecting a very large harvest; for both corn and soybeans we thi nk it will be a record. The wheat crop, with even less planting, was very strong. I talked with one of the major co-ops last week and they are actually bringing back on line elevators that they had abandone d earlier in order to store the surplus they have. Livestock produc ers are doing better; ca ttlem en are actually making m oney and, of course, the hog industr y is now m aking m oney. On the financial front, the farm ers did com e in with much str onger balance sheets this season. Frankly, the 8/24/99 54 benefits from governm ent paym ents and prospect ive increases in those paym ents are really going to buoy their net inco me flows. So, while we are seei ng a deterioration in som e farm operations--and as a result of that, in som e Main Street operations--we are not seeing m ajor problem s surfacing in loan portf olios. The nonperform ing loans are increasing, but nowhere near as sharply as they di d the last tim e we went th rough this kind of situation. Turning to the national side, I will only add a bit to what others have said. I would say first of all that we are proj ecting continued econom ic grow th, though not as strong as the Greenbook projection. Certai nly, som e of the fa vorable factors seem  to be reversing, but we do see strong dom estic dem and. And if the gl obal econom y picks up as we believe it m ight, we m ay have som e strong pressures on the dem and side in the econom y that we have to be mindful of a s we go forwar d. With that I’ll stop.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The regional econom y in the Philadelphia District continues to m ove up. Manufacturing has advanced  modestly. Retail sales and tourist activity have been strong. Construction has increased. Employm ent is on an upward trend. Conditions in the financial sector are so-so, with loan dem and reported flat. Agricu lture, becaus e of the drou ght, is  hurtin g, and som e of the sm aller banks th at servic e mostly f arm communities a lmost surely will suf fer as well late r in the yea r and going into next year. Anecdotally, I am  beginning to pick up a subtle shift in tone about pricing power. I have the sens e that more business people fe el a stronger need to raise prices to protect financial pe rform ance, and they feel they  may be able to m ake price increases s tick. In part, this feeling refl ects a v iew, whether accurate or not, that both consum ers and businesses are less inclined to shop  for the lowest price or the best deal than they have been. I don’t want to m ake m ore out of  this point than warrant ed; it’s just a subtle change. I don’t think it is a m ajor sh ift nor is it a  view held b y a m ajority of  business people, but I just hav e not sensed it u p until fairly  recen tly. The national econom y is clearly stretched. The outlook both for growth and inflation, however, rem ains unclear. There is a reason able case for a d ecelerating trend in dem and growth going forward, largely based on less of a kick from  equity gains. But we could be fooled again. On the inflation side, pr oductivity gains m ay continue to hold down inflation ary pressures--a nd I suspect they will--but that m ay not happen either. 8/24/99 55 On balance, the risk to the econom y of raisi ng the funds rate a notch  is less than not raising it. A more im portant issue today is  how we position ourselves going forward and how we m anage our rhetoric during the com ing days and weeks, topics for later in the meeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH. Mr. Chairm an, the Second District’s econom y has shown renewed signs of strength in recent  weeks, after s ome slowing in the second quarter. Despite increasing pri ce pressures, there is no evidence of any broad-based pickup in inflation. Private sector job growth accelerat ed to a 3.1 percent annual rate in July from 1.7 percent in the second quarter. Retailers repor t that sales retreated in  July and were close to plan, following unusual strength in May and J une. Most attribute this downshift to lean inventories, but it was so oppre ssively hot that a lot of peopl e might just have decided to stay hom e. Prices paid by retailers rem ain steady, but selling prices have firm ed up just a little. The housing m arket has gained m omentum  since the last repo rt. Residential building perm its rebo unded sharp ly in June, led by a su rge in the m ultifam ily sector. We’ve had double-digit price appreciation in  most of the downstate New York housing m arkets. Office lows and rents rising m oderately. Purchasing managers indicate that m anufacturing activity expanded moderately in both June and July, wh ile price pressures increased. Banks report a seasonal dip in loan dem and, tightening credit st andards, and stable delinquency rates. Our view on the dom estic econom y is that we will continue to see positive real growth, about 3½ percent in the second half  of 1999 and about 2½ percent in 2000. My colleagues in the research gr oup are anticipating a growth r ecession in 2001, which is very conveniently tim ed to help keep inflation under control. But, unlike m ost of what we’ve been hearing around the table, our view is that  the inflation pressures, which we too have been forecas ting for the last few years, are in fa ct much better contain ed. It may be that if you leave your research staff alone--just as if  you leave your kids alone they grow up okay-­eventua lly they will de cide tha t inflation r eally  isn’t going to happen af ter all. I rather share that view. I think what we ha ve now should be called price st ability; that is, it is not something toward which we are working to achieve. And, therefore, our view of the 8/24/99 56 inflation forecast is th at we will continue to  enjoy price s tability, which is our sta tutory assignm ent. The global situation is certai nly better, as Karen Johnson de scribed. It is much better than it was last fall when this Comm ittee correctly exercised both responsibility and leadership by easing m onetary policy three tim es to respond to a world financial crisis. But the global situation is still highly problem atic even though Karen’s forecast is, I think, a very reasonable bet. I believe that Japan is still having trem endous difficulty trying to figure out what to do to solve its very basic econom ic problem s. Until and if it figures that out, it will con tinue to be a sou rce of  syste mic risk bot h to the rest of  the world and cer tainly to its own people. In addition, I find the situation in China getting worse,  in the direction of pressure going forward, as a result of  the deve lopm ents on the political side. And on the econom ic side, there is little pos itive effect com ing from  a great deal of pum p prim ing of a Keynesian variety that is also  blowin g air into th e dom estic stock m arkets. South Korea took a high ly positiv e and very courageous step  in the dism antling of Daewoo, but that is a very, very tough workout situati on in a country with absolutely  no experience in workouts. The situation in our hem isphere, I think, is ge tting m ore troub ling. Two of the countries, B razil and Argentina, are potentially  serious problem s. Karen described very well what’s going on there, but in m y view the biggest problem is I believe the dangers to that  country’s econom y are very real. Argentina’s success of recent years has been , in m y view, m ainly the result of excellen t leadership from President Menem . He is about to leave office.  The candidate from  his own party certainly doesn’t sound like him . And the candidate from  the other party, who is ahead in the polls, represents a coalition that ha s agreed only that they would like to win the election. They have no agreem ent on policy m atters and, therefor e, the policy they would follow is a m atter of very considerable uncertaint y. So it is not surp rising that market pressure is being felt there. Mexico, at least accord ing to Moody’s, is im proving. And yet next year is the sixth year of a presidential term, always a problem period, and one in which the political result is so uncertain that a weakness of public confid ence and a weakn ess in inv estor confidenc e both within Mexico and outside are very real possibilities. Ecuador is highly likely to default on its Brady bonds; and even though it is a very sm all country, that would be the 8/24/99 57 first default on Brady bonds. And it m akes rather dram atic the point that  there are now four countries--Pakistan, Ukraine, Rom ania, and Ec uador--in which the In ternational Monetary Fund, correctly in m y view, has not found enough pr ivate sector support to justify the use of public funds. Russia is not only a m ess in and of itself, but is bringing very severe p ressure and c riticism  on the IMF, which will likely h ave the ef fect of making the Fund less capable of carrying out its responsibilities. Growth in the Euro area is slow and spotty, and in som e of the countries, partic ularly Germ any, the govern ment is having trouble keeping a co alition tog ether to follo w the polic ies tha t they think--and I agree --are necessary. Well, that is not a very p retty picture! It certainly is a m uch less pretty picture than the one we all thought we were looking at in the spring of 1997. And even though it is a lot better, or less bad, than the one that we were loo king at last f all, it se ems to m e one that we have to keep in m ind. Although we are not th e central banker of the world, given the f act that we are the unique world super power and the m ain econom y with the m ain currency, we have to do two things in this Comm ittee. The f irst is that we have to do the right thing on monetary policy. But, as Ed Boehne suggested, in  our rhetoric we have to try to get out the message and then stick to it in term s of what it is we are doing and what we intend to do. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. On cars, trucks, and steel, which are all very im portant in our District, I can just say “d itto” to what Mike Moskow said: All are very strong in every dim ension. Construction in the District also is very strong. is involved with the construction unions said that the best sign of the prosperity in construc tion labor m arkets is that the local brewer ies all seem to be expanding! He regularly reports to us now about warnings  being given by the AFL-CIO that wages of workers are not being kept up. He’s starting to stress what he c onsiders to be the need for a catch-up in com pensation. So, at least from  that one source, there’s a suggestion that a bit more labor m ilitancy m ight be forthcom ing. On the steel side, th e strikes settled with inc reases in th e range of 8 to 10 percent over the full three-year period and that sounds pret ty good. But they doubled the pensions. So they avoided the bigger problem  of disruption by  prom ises about the future rather than the 8/24/99 58 present. Our directors are telli ng us that there will not be a st rike in the auto industry--that Ford, which is the targ et, will se ttle. They be lieve Ford will s ettle and th en Chrysler a nd GM and the others will just f all in lin e. Let m e skip som e of the other po ints in m y prepared notes because it would just be repeating w hat a num ber of other people have mentioned. In labor m arkets we are hearing about a couple of new wrinkles. One is a “s how-up” bonus: If the workers com e to work five consecutive days they get a bonus! [Laughter] And one firm  pays a daily bonus for workers who show up in the m orning on tim e and fi nish a full shift. That is probably not showing up in wage and ECI data. One banker asserted that we are exp eriencing a lo t of wage inflation, but it does not show up in the figures because businesses that he’s fam iliar with are paying the sam e or som ewhat more for considerab ly less qualified people than previously. Somebody earlier mentioned that schools were losing people to the private sector, but the bankers in our area claim  that they are losing people to  the schools, that the school districts and local governm ents are flush with funds from tax receipts and are bidding aggressively for people. Nevertheless, the schoo ls opened for the fall term with shortages in teach ing pos itions and in  som e staff position s and a reported “severe” sho rtage of subs titute teachers. We took an in-depth look at what is going on in labor m arkets in the health care sector. Health care is a huge industry in the Dist rict, with the Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals, a nd others in Cleveland a nd Pittsbu rgh as well. You m ay have seen the Wall Street Journal story yesterday about the health quality program  in our city that the Cleveland Clinic m anaged to kill off. That sort of thi ng is not the real problem . The problem  is that they do not have enough people. We have been told of shortages throughout the District of nurses and other staff to support the hospitals. One contact claim ed that it is an ongoing crisis. One hospital sa id it had gone to a work schedule of three 12-hour days with four days off for the nurses, and that getting floor coverage in hospitals on a 24-hour basis is becom ing increasingly problem atic. The hiring coordinator at th e Clev eland Clinic s aid the shortage is the worst she has seen in 20 years.  Others, including Meridian Health System s, described the situation sim ilarly. They say it is not just a shortage of nurses but of support staff as wel l. 8/24/99 59 When one talks to people in the health care industry it is not uncommon for them  to use words like acute and critical, but they are usually talking about thei r patients. In this case th ey ar e talk ing ab out the ir staff levels. Ohio State University repo rted tha t its c ritical care unit and operating room s are not  adequately staffed with com petent people. So th ey are using retention bonuses, referral bonuses, and prem ium pay for those working overtim e, special hours, or weekends. The VA hospital said that the shortage of staff is so severe that they’ve d ecided to clo se som e inpatient units, such as their long-term  care unit, sim ply because they could not staff it. If that ’s no t bad enough--p robably o ther areas of th e country are experiencin g this, too --a race is going on between Rite-Aid and CVS to see who can overbuild the m ost and the fastest and th ey are bidding away th e pharm acists on hospital staffs. Our VA contact said that pharm acists are getting $8,000 to $10,000 more in salary to move to the reta il side. On the national econom y, if I were focusing on the dom estic side alone, I’d say that the risk is on the upside on inflation and that po licy is not balanced for that risk. Yet the international dim ension--and Bill M cDonough descri bed in so me detail th e political risks--is where I think all of the risk s are in the other direction. I agree with Karen Johnson’s description about the near-term  econom ic outlo ok in Japan, Europe, and elsewhere. But with that shaky coalition in Japan, it is very hard to have c onfidence about what is going to happen there. I think Chancellor Schroeder f aces extrao rdinary challeng es over th e next couple of months in Europe, and what happens  is going to be extrem ely im portant for the outlook for the rest of Europe. The Italians ar e certainly not going to attack pension refor m if the Germ ans do not com e through with solid  refor m. The good news about the ongoing saga in Russia is So, that’s the silver lining. We will hav e to be prep ared a t all tim es for an easing ac tion that cou ld be necess ary because of s ome develo pment on th e external s ide. I would rather go in to that s ituation feeling that monetary policy is  positioned where it ought to be in term s of our dom estic risk, so we can respond to unforecastable intern ational developm ents when they  happen.

MR. MCTEER. The Eleventh District is apparently doing bette r than th e Fourth District, wh ere schoo lteachers are m oving into industry and bankers are beginning to teach 8/24/99 60 school! Growth is still very strong in the District, but it has slowed just a little. Construction has been flat, net, due to concer ns about overbuilding, risi ng interest rates, and shortages of personnel and m aterials. Energy producers are responding to higher prices, but very cau tiously. The rig count is up only a bi t; it’s still b elow the leve l of last December when oil was $11 a barrel. The outlook for Mexico is cautiously im proved. All of Mexico’s leading ind icators were po sitive in the second quarter, sugges ting a strong s econd half. But the peso and the stock m arket have given back some gains this quarter, tem pering the outlook for early 2000. And, of c ourse, as  Bill McDonough m entioned, an election is coming up. Labor m arkets are extrem ely tight in Texas. At the last San Antonio board m eeting I attend ed, the  direc tor fro m Brownsville m entione d that a m ilestone had be en reach ed in Brownsville: The unemploym ent rate had fallen into sing le-digits for the first tim e anyone there could rem ember. We looked it up and the last tim e it was below 10 percent was in 1981. While unem ploym ent is still high in the border areas, only the town of McAllen had an unem ploym ent rate well above 10 percent; it is  around 13 percent or so. In El Paso it is right at 10 percent, but the other border towns now report rates of slightly below 10 percent. Most of the larger non-border cities in Texas and in the Eleventh District more generally have unem ploym ent rates below 4 percent. And labor participation rate s in our m ajor cities are far abov e the national average.  I am  told that in Austin an d Dallas ther e are a lmost 9 jobs for every 10 residents between the ag es of 16 and 65. However, to paraphrase Professor Tobin, higher labor costs are everywhere  but in the data. District em ployers tell us that they are paying more  for everyone from  programm ers and engineers to tem porary workers, truckers, and legal staff. We have not  seen thes e increas es in o ur wage statistics, but the statistics have limited industry coverage and they don’t count stock options and other fringe benefits. The anecdotal evidence relating to the price picture is m ixed. Our Beigebook contacts reported m ore increases in prices than reducti ons. However, house prices rose m ore slowly than in the past. Energy prices  were up and ther e was a sligh t price incr ease in th e retail sector, but prices were down for timber, conc rete, and m emory chips. And, of course, the Chairm an has pushed down far m prices all by him self! 8/24/99 61 On the national front, I believe that infla tion remains under control, even while the econom y rem ains very strong. If one were worried about inflation, the most im portant statistics to look at would be th e various m easures of inflation. These statistics offer little reason for concern. Core inflation is about as low as it was last year--significantly lower by some measures, a little higher by som e. The co re CPI increased at a 1.7 percent annual rate during the first seven m onths of 1999, com pared  to a 2.4 percent increase in all of 1998. The core PCE deflator increased at a 1.4 per cent annual rate during th e first two quarters, compared to a 1.2 percent rise in all of 1998. Is higher inflation in the pipeline?  The core PPI is down 0.2 percent for the first seven m onths of the year. The ECI signals little threat, either, if one considers the lo w first-quarter increase along w ith the larger second-quarter rise. The index rose at a 2.9 percent annual rate during the fi rst two quarters, com pared to an increase of 3.3 percent in all of 1998. Looking bey ond the inflation num bers, we will get shortly a revised secon d-quarter GDP number, which will probably be below 2 percen t. If it is below 1.8 percent, it will be the lowes t quarterly increase in real GDP in at le ast a coup le of years. Employm ent growth remains vigorous. Even m anufacturing em ployment has increased. The decline in unem ployment has no t only rea ched into th e border areas of Texas, but it has reduced minority unem ploym ent nationwide. With infl ation low and with the econom y strong, I am concerned that any tightening today would be interpreted as  a vote against prosperity.

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Most of the m ajor econom ic trends in our District remain in p lace or have in tensifie d recently. Consu mer spending is healthy. Housing and nonresidential construction activit y are strong. The m anufacturing sector is doing well; the agricultural sector is not. Labor markets rem ain tight and I think it is f air to say, at least based on the anecdot al evidence, that wage increases have notched up a bit. I would not say the sam e thing about infla tion, although I do have the im pression that discounting has dim inished, and that is the other side of the price coin I suppose. As far as the national econom y is con cerned, the outlook is good. My principal concern in the current circum stances has to do with aggregate supply and productivity. I think agg regate dem and is growing at a satisfactor y pace at least and is lik ely to con tinue to do so. We all know that we have very tight labor m arkets and it’s clear that the rate of 8/24/99 62 increase in com pensation has b een accelerating. I believe ther e is a chance that it will continue to do so. This m ay all play out fine as long as aggregate supply and, in particular, productivity  grow rapidly enough to offset that  acceleration and keep demand and sup ply in balance. The risk is th at that won’t happen. And if it doesn’t , the inflationary consequences concern m e.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, conditions in the Eighth District are as they have been. The environm ent is good, and I do not have any part icular news to report. I want to spend a couple of m inutes on the inform ation I have got ten from  FedEx and UPS, which is rather interesting b ecause it is a bit m ixed in term s of the dom estic econom y. But first, both of m y contacts report that their inte rnational bu siness is doing fine, better than anticipated. FedEx says that it sees in creas ing gro wth abroad; volum e from the United States to foreign m arkets and from  markets abroad into the United States is growing, especially for Asia. In fact, FedEx reports th at the inte rnation al busin ess is 3 to 5 perc ent stronger than had been anticipated in  the m onths of June and July. On the domestic side, m y FedEx contact t hought that there w as a clear sign of som e slowing in volum e--not dram atic, but clearl y perceptible. FedEx reported that its ow n business was slower year over year for the first tim e in a long tim e. That was not, however, the vi ew of m y UPS contact. He said that the econom y was boom ing and that UPS volum e was exceeding p roject ions, do mestically and internatio nally. Through July, year-to-date volum e was up 4.6 per cent over the com parable  months of last year, versus an expected increase  of 3.9 percent, so that is si gnificantly above what they had planned. Growth was especially strong in domestic ground business. My UPS contact had just returned from  meetings at As I said, b oth UPS and FedEx agreed that business with  Asia was really picking up. My FedEx contact reported that there is no que stion that fuel pri ces are hurting. He said that FedEx has put a surcharge on W est Coast less-than-truck-load traffic, and he expects m ore surcharges to be put into effect  if fuel prices rem ain high. FedEx is not concerned about wage pressures; m y source sa id the com pany is m aking up wage increases 8/24/99 63 with productivity gains. My UPS contact sa id that his com pany has continuing severe problem s in the labor m arket. UPS has a lo t of part-tim e em ployees who are college students. In trying to reduce em ployee turnove r, which has becom e a significant problem -­and this of course should rem ain confiden tial until UPS decides to announce it--UPS expects to reopen its la bor union contract. I would also note that UPS has had to divert traffic out of Chicago--Mike Moskow talked about the pressures in the Chicago labor market--since the comp any cannot handle the volum e in Chicago because of the labor shortage  there. So, those are a few anecdotes  from those two sources. One of our research departm ent people put together som e data on em ploym ent growth that I thought was interesting. In the last year em ploym ent growth am ong both m ales and females in the 25 to 54 age bracket was 0.8 percen t. That is pretty much in line with the demographics. The em ploym ent growth ha s been com ing entirely from  what labor econom ists call secondary workers, including a lo t of older people. Growth in em ploym ent of workers 65 and over, m ale and fe male, was 4½ percent; among those aged 55 to 64, people who should be working anyw ay but had opted for early retirem ent, it was 4.3 percen t. So it is cle ar that the em ployment expansion has been com ing in these demographic breakdow ns that have relatively low participation rates.  In principle, there is a lot of room  for expansion. On the other ha nd, most people over 65 have retired for good reasons, so presum ably there has to be som e limit to how m any of those can be brought back into th e labo r force. In the course of our budget work at the St . Louis Fed, we were quite taken aback by the increas e in health care cost s that we are facin g. I asked our HR people to do a survey of all the other Federal Reserve Ba nks. I thought that would be eas y information to get. Of course, th ese are tentative guesse s and som e of the final contracts m ay be different, but let me just read you those num bers. In term s of health care costs, the Reserve Banks are looking at the following increases: Boston, 14 to 20 percent; New York, 6 to 11 percent; 8/24/99 64 Philadelphia, 9 percent; Cleveland, 10 percen t; Richmond 7½ to 15 percent; Atlanta, 10 to 20 percent; Chicago 13 to 15 percent; at ou r own Bank in St. Louis, 14 to 15 percent; Minneapolis, 15 percent; Kansas  City, 7 to 8 percent; and Da llas, 8 to 10 percent. San Francisco had a very accurate forecast of som ewhere between 2.4 and 23.8 percent! [Laughter] I don’t know what the average ther e is going to be.* I found this rather interesting b ecause I wondered to w hat extent o ur experience in the S t. Louis area was peculiar. But, in f act, th is is a very, very general phenom enon  and these costs are clearly up quite a b it from  what we’ve seen in recent years.  I think we can regard th at part of lab or costs as p retty m uch baked in the cak e. So we can anticipate that those co sts will be showing up in the ECI as those contracts are actually signed and take effect next year. In term s of the prospects ahead of us, the Greenb ook forecast, of course, is for somewhat lower real growth and somewhat higher inflation. I think we have to be ready to deal with the prospect that gr owth will tu rn out to  be a litt le lower and inf lation a little higher than forecas t; in my view that outco me has a m uch higher probab ility than th e reverse. And that will be an uncom fortable situ ation. It means that th e financial m arkets are going to be whipsawed. One day they are going to get data showing lower growth and they will say, “Oh, the Fed is  going to eas e.” The nex t day they are going to g et data that s uggest the inf lation problem  is worse than a nticipated and they will expect th e Fed to tighten. We are going to have a tricky problem  of setting a steady course. That is all I am  going to say at this point. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich.

MR. GRAM LICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. My bottom  line today is that I think the FOMC ought to do what it has to do at th is meeting and then leave financial m arkets alone for a while, at least until the end of the year. What do we have to do?  I would argue that rates are a bit low from  three standpoints. Even if labor markets and inflation were in balance, for the longer run the funds rate m ight be  a bit too low. The r eal interest rate based on the TIP bonds is now 4 per cent; adding a reasonable am ount fo r target inflation puts the equilibrium  funds rate in the m id-5 percent area . Even if we assum e that there is som e * Secretary’s note: Subseque nt to the meeting Mr. Parry i ndicated that the 2.4 percent is the increase in medical plan premiums and t he 23.8 percent refers to the increase in the  dental pla n premium. The weighted a verage inc rease for the Sa n Francisco Di strict is 5.8 perce nt. 8/24/99 65 liquid ity premium in the TIP rate, we still get an equilib rium  funds rate that is a b it abo ve the actual funds rate. But labor m arkets m ay not be in balan ce. The Greenbook gives scattered, early evidence of accelerating wage gain s. The eviden ce is no t only scattered and early bu t each particular piece of evidence is deb atable. Nevertheless, wages do seem  to be ris ing more rapidly than earlier. We can look at labor m arkets in any number of ways: We can com pare NAIRU with actua l une mploym ent rates ; we ca n add in discouraged workers; we can take all the Beigebook anecdotes. I even heard seve ral anecdotes on National P ublic Radio the other day. They all seem to suggest that labo r markets are very, very tight and that wage gains m ay finally be accelerating. Even if labor m arkets were in balance now , they m ight not stay that way. In the constant funds rate forecast of the Greenbook, which is m y favorite, the rate of growth in aggregate dem and after the Y2K quarter averages  about 4 percent. I think that would be greater than anybody’s estim ate of aggregate supply growth, however enhanced by the productivity  changes. And if the forecast is ac curate, there would be a further tightening of labor m arkets. To m e, therefor e, a number of indicators suggest  that the funds rate is a bit low. Let m e make a quick digression on a point that I raised last  time about leading indicators of  inflation. The ever-responsive st aff has looked into this and written a nice memo--nice, but I m ust say from  my point of view disappointing. Indices of leading indicators h ad more or less worked up until 199 0 but did not predict well  at all in the 1990s. Moreover, m any of the actual com ponent series are already labor m arket indicators. And when controlling for these struct ural model variables, leading indicators are not even close to being significant predictors of inflation. At times a particular seri es may have predicted a phenom enon, but as a general rule I must reluct antly adm it that that approach doesn’t seem to help us any. So, to get back to m y earlier point, I think we ought to m ake som e adjustm ent today. But after that--Peter F isher’s m emo thoroughly scared m e as I think it probably scared others--we probably want to have  as few m oving financial parts as possible as we go toward the end of the year.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 8/24/99 66 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I read  the recent data as consistent with a continued m omentum  in aggregate dem and that is  likely to support growth at or above trend in the period  imm ediately ahead and m aintain very tight labor m arkets. I see core inflation stabilizing am id signs of a dissipation or re versal of m any of the favorable supply shocks that have contributed to low and declining inflation over the last couple of years and stirrings, perhaps, of higher wage gains. This sets the stage for a test of the role of tight labor m arkets on inflation going forward. I exp ect we all lo ok forward to learn ing a little more about just how new the new econom y rea lly is. The story in the Greenbook--and one that I can definitely relate to-- is that the dissipation or reve rsal of favorable supply shocks, includ ing th e stab ilizatio n in trend productiv ity growth, will allow the effects of prevailing tightn ess in the labor m arket to show through. We will m aintain growth at near trend over the forecast horizon with  gradual up ward pressu re on inflation. The result is a core inflation rate that in the Greenbo ok forecast moves fr om about 2 percent recently to 2¾ percent by the end of next year, with the m omentum  pointing to a further increase in 2001, even allowing for two ¼ point tightening moves. An interes ting f eature of  the f orecast is th at the initial step -up to a 2½ pe rcent rate is alre ady in train and is reflected in the quarterly data in the forecast for the fourth quarter. In additi on, the 2¾ percent rate at the end of 2000 would be higher on a m ethodologically consistent basis than the core CPI inflation rate over the year 1995, before the coincidence of pow erful disinflationary forces took hold. One of the issues tha t we face and will con tinue to face in our policy de liberations is how m uch to take in to account a forecast of ri sing inflation as opposed to  the realization of utiliza tion a nd inf lation rates going forward. That is, how proactive and forward-looking are we prepared to be in light  of uncertainties abou t the structure of inflation dynam ics and the poor forecasting record of recent years? Let m e point out, relative to the Greenbook baseline forecast, a couple of contingen cies that I th ink are pa rticularly  important and deserve m ention--that is, a correction in equity prices and a sharper-t han-projected declin e in the do llar. The combination in the Greenbook forecast of a tigh tening m onetary policy, slowing growth, rising inflation, and a declining dollar appears to raise the potential for an equity m arket correction. However, I certainly would not want  to tem per a tightening of m onetary policy by relying on an expected equity m arket correc tion to slow growth. Rather, we have to be 8/24/99 67 prepared to adjust m onetary policy in light of how overall financial conditions evolve in response to our policy actions. I read the Greenbook as sugges ting that the staff has an asymm etric probability distribution with respect to the exchange rate, with a m uch gr eater chance of a lower than a higher ex change rate ev olving over the forecast horizon. Given the difficulty in forecasting exchange rates and particularly tim ing the eff ect on exchange rates of a large and widening curren t acco unt deficit, the best way to handle the situ ation m ay be, as the staff has done, by providing an  alternative s imulation with a shar per declin e of the do llar. But the recen t upside surprises to foreign growth and the high and rising U.S. cu rrent account deficit should weigh heavily on the dollar going forw ard. This m ay tem per any slowdown in 2000 and reinforce upward pressu re on inflation. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. It seem s to me that the questions before us today are both factua l and tactica l. At a f actual lev el, I be lieve the issu e is whether or not we really are facing an end to  the good news on inflati on. There are certainly some reasons, based on the data, to believe that  that m ay be the case. Over the past 12 months the core CPI has gone up about 2.1 percen t, which is certainly m oderate by anyone’s measure ment. But the annual rate of change in the core CPI has m oved up from  a little under 1 percent in Q1 of 1999 to about 2.3 or 2.4 percent in Q 2 of 1999. More significantly, there m ay be som e potential signs of early inflat ion, so-called pipeline inflation, in the m ost recen t PPI. But without putting too much wei ght on that, in the contex t of strengthen ing growth overseas, a com mensurate weakening of the U.S. dollar, expected strength in exports, and a likely rise in both oil and nonoil import prices, I think we can well expect a further firm ing tendency in U.S. prices. Obvi ously, this is against the backdrop of labor of NAIRU is less relevant than  the fact that we have seen already som e uptick in hourly compensation figures. As Karen Johnson has already indicated, we  are in a period of  unusual asynchronous global growth patterns that have arguably al lowed us to enjoy a very benign growth and pricing pictu re. At the end of this as ynchr onous period I thin k we will als o see an end  to some of the factors that have  allowed us to enjoy benefits  of excess capacity and slack 8/24/99 68 demand from overseas. That will p ut a f urther spotligh t on the question of  growing productivity here in the United States. Unfortunately, just w hen the im portance of that factor has be come a little  clearer to u s, the da ta have becom e a lot less c lear--particularly the issue of m easuring the econom y from the product side versus the incom e side, which I suspect we’ll com e back to during the course of the year. Against the background of this factual uncer tainty, I think we’re faced with a very important tactical question. From  my perspectiv e there are som e risks to  the forecast. One, for sure, is that it depends at least in part on a w aning of wealth  effects. And we know from experience that calling f or a slowing  of the e quity m arkets has proven to be a trium ph of hope over experien ce. S econdly, we also see in  this forecast som e expectation that th e desired level of inventories in the private sector, or expectati ons regarding the relationship between inventories and projected sales, m ay have  changed a bit. I think that m ay be true because of som e structu ral changes. But we also have to be m indful that in the year 2000 we m ay see som e other forces that cause inve ntories to be higher than perhaps businesses would otherwise like to have. Finally, from a tactical standpoint we have to be m indful of the fact that we are in an unusual period. Year 2000 fears do m ake m arkets skittish. And if the ge neral inclination of the Comm ittee is that we want to firm a bit as  an insurance p olicy if you will, I sugg est we do so sooner rather than later. Whenever we ar e in the process of rais ing rates, even by a small amount, we are about as popular as a skun k at an outdoor wedding  reception. But if that is the case, I think we s hould do a little defensive spraying --at least for the bride and her mother.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I believe I am  the final hitter in the lineup today and the day is getting on, but let m e offer a brief summ ary of the situation as I see it, although this is adm ittedly rather rep etitious. The econom y continues to exhibit a great deal of funda mental strength though we may be ge tting a bit of the l ong-expected slowdown. However, the consensus expectation for the seco nd half is for growth of 3½ percent or likely 8/24/99 69 more than th at, which would m ark a return to a p ace above a sustain able level. Left unconstrained, this could go on into and perhap s through next year, which would introduce substantia l addition al upside r isks. So far, the ov erhea ting th is threa tens h as been m ore than damped by s trong productivity gains, with im portant assistance from  spec ial world cyclical factors. While this could well continue for a time, it seem s to m e increasingly dangerous to depend too heavily upon productivity  alone to hold inflationary pressures in check, as the reinforcem ent provided by a weak world ec onom y seem s likely to be dissipating. If overheating were allowed to occur and ignite a co st-driven rise in inflation, it could be quite difficult to deal with. Serious downside risks to econom ic activity exist, as always, with the most readily  identifiable potential  culprits liable to be the sk y-high stock m arket and the still fragile world econom y and exchange rate structur e as well as the ever-present possibility of exogenous shocks. But at this juncture the dow nside risks would seem  to be of both lower magnitude and probability than the upside risks. The federal funds rate is still 50 basis point s below the level that existed prior to the financial crisis of a year ago. While one cannot by any m eans say that all vestiges of that episode have disappeared, conditions have im proved m arkedly. I can see little m otivation in recen t experience o r likely short-term prospect s for continuing all o r perhaps any of the remaining degree of stimulus put in place at that tim e. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s move on to Don Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Judging from the rem arks of policym akers, a further sm all increase in the federal funds rate would seem  to be in the works at this m eeting. Private domestic dem and is expected to rem ain strong, at a tim e when the restraining effects of fi scal policy and of developm ents overseas will be diminishing. Deepening problem s abroad  and their spillover to the U.S. econom y and financial m arkets have played an important role in justifying holding policy steady from  late 1997 through last summer and then eas ing last f all. In effect, the Committee has allowed r elatively accomm odative financial conditions to boost domestic dem and in order to offset the depressing effect on dom estic production of lower exports and higher im ports--and the FO MC has had additional scope to do so while keeping inflation contained as foreign developm ents da mped im port prices. The easings last fall in part icular were designed to protect not only again st the anticip ated effects of global financial m arket turm oil, but to take acco unt of heightened downside risks as well. In larg e measure because of these policies, the United  States no t only rem ained an “oasis 8/24/99 70 of prosperity” but--to stretch th e metaphor to the breaking point-­provided water to the rest of the wo rld in the form of strong dem and for its goods and services. But now dom estic dem and abroad is strengthening and im port price taken hold in a num ber of e merging market econom ies, and, while the vigor of the European and Japanese econom ies may be in question, at least the downside risks in those econom ies appear to have greatly diminished. Under these circum stances it becom es increasingly important to trim  the strength of domest ic dem and here if we are to avoid putting additional pressures on U.S. re sources. The turnaround abroad is occurring when the level of labor resource utilization he re at hom e is extraordinarily high. The unem ploym ent ra te is as low as it has been on a sustain ed basis sin ce th e late 1960 s, and som e recent data on labor costs at least hint at the po ssibility tha t it might be too low to be consistent with contain ing inflation. Even if the Committee is n ot yet ready to judge these recen t data as the b eginning of an uptrend in unit labor cost increases, as  in the s taff forecas t, it may still s ee the current unem ployment rate as low enough to ju stify tilting policy on the side of forestalling any further declin es in the unem ploym ent rate. The slowing of dom estic dem and nee ded to keep the unem ploym ent rate from  falling is likely to depe nd, as Mike noted, on retaining the greater degree of restraint in financ ial m arkets that evolved over recent months as private long-term  interest  rates rose 75 basi s points and stock prices leveled off. That restraint, in turn, owed importantly to growing expectations  that the Fed eral Res erve would tighten policy. A fir ming at this m eeting , togethe r with the a ction taken in June, w ould validate those expectations and should tend to keep interest rates and equity prices near current levels. If the Committee decides  to raise it s target for the federal funds rate by ¼ percen tage poin t, as in altern ative C in the Bluebook, you will also need to decide what your view is of  the balance of risks going forward and how to convey that view to the public. An inflation outlook sim ilar to that  in the staff fore cast would offer a rationale for adopting and announcing an asymmetric directive. In that forecast, the unem ployment rate is ju dged currently to be app reciab ly below its sustainable level and fina ncial conditions not yet restrictive enough to dam p demand sufficiently to raise that rate. Consequently, inflation is on an upward trend in 2000 and beyond, even with the assum ption of a near-term fir ming of  policy and another tightening next spring. An alternative model sim ulation in the Greenbook indicates that something like 150 basis points of tig htening would be needed by m id-8/24/99 71 2000 to cap inflation at a little ov er recent rates. With actual or anticipated century date change disruptions in m arkets possibly constraining policy increasingly over the fourth q uarte r, if the Comm ittee thought it might want to  raise rates by a substantial am ount by next spring, it m ight want to give serious consideration to tightening again in that the Committee saw  the inf lation risks a s remaining s erious and was determ ined to take action in the near term  to forestall a prolonged acceleration in prices. Tightening in October oug ht to be far enough in advance of year-end to avoid aggrav ating m arket dislocations stemm ing from  last-m inute cen tury date chang e preparation s. An asymm etrical directiv e after a 25 basis point rate  increase would come as a surprise to m arket partic ipants, and their responses would help to im pose added restra int the Comm ittee would f ind helpf ul if it were s till quite concerned about inflation risks. Interest rates would rise som ewhat and m arkets would rem ain volatile, pressuring spreads, which have retreated in recent day s when beni gn price d ata seem ed to reduce the odds on a policy tightening in the fo urth quarter. Judging from the response to the May tilt announcem ent a nd the July testim ony, with a tilt toward tightening m arkets would be likely to react m ore strongly to incom ing data that tended to confirm intens ifying price p ressures than to inform ation that did not point in that direction, and there is a high probability that they wo uld build in a further rate incr ease in  October unless th e data were con sisten tly to the weak sid e. If, on the other hand, th e Comm ittee saw the inf lation risks as having been reduced enough by its two tightenings to allow it to observe incom ing data for a while without the presum ption of a near-term tightening, it m ight want to adopt an d announce a symmetrical directive. After 50 basis points of federal funds rate increases this  year and little apparent change in inflation exp ectations, the Committee will already have raised real in terest rates app reciably in the last few m onths. Those increases, as  they cam e to be exp ected, were larg ely responsible for pushing m any private long-term  rates up to their highest levels since the end of the 1994-95 series of tighteni ngs, and they have contributed to sustain ing a slower grow th trend for money and credit. Recen t data on several components of final sales already suggest a m oderating trend, with thes e readings taken  even before most of the effects of the rise in interest rates and flattening of equ ity prices have been felt. As a consequence, the Comm ittee m ay see the risks around the forecast of slowing growth as m uch better balan ced than they have been for som e time. Uncertainties about the growth in productivity, th e level of the NAIRU, and the supply side of the econom y more generally also m ay 8/24/99 72 support the case for a spell of watchful waiting. Such uncertainties m ake preem ptive policy m ore difficult, and may argue, as noted in the papers sent to the C ommittee before its last  meeting, for tem pering the response to estim ated output gaps relative to that on incom ing inflation data. In these circum stances, with core in flation still quite subdued, if the econom y looked like it was slowing to the growth rate of its potential, the Comm ittee m ight want som ewhat more ev idence that labor costs were on a sustained upward trend relative to the growth of productivity--and that theref ore the  unem ployment ra te was too low--bef ore deciding that it needed to tighten further. Finally, financial m arkets rem ain unusually skittish and sensitive. After the cr isis of  last su mmer, par ticipants are le ss willing an d less ab le to arbitrage spreads back down once they have begun to widen. Moreover, widening spreads on Brady bonds and weakening equity suggest that confidence is fragile and that downside risks persist in these econom ies and are perceived to be hei ghtened by increases in interest rates in th e United Sta tes. Even at  hom e, reduced liquidity has m ade century date change and shifting perceptions of m onetary policy intentions. A symm etrical direc tive would reduce one source of uncertainty and volatility, perhaps leaving m arkets better able to cope with other problem s, such as centu ry date change preparations. A symm etrical directive would not  rule out a near-term  policy action should developm ents take a significant unexpected turn. But such a directive co uld convey the Comm ittee’s feeling that in the n ear term , absent such an eventuality, it would be  content to evaluate the data and the effects o f actions already take n. If this were the Comm ittee’s intention, care would be needed to ensure that this cam e through in the announcem ent, so that market participants did not interpret the symm etry as merely a repeat of the symmetry in June, which they have been told was m ore fundam entally asymm etric than they first perceived.

Following up on a number of the issues that Peter Fisher raised at the beginning of our m eeting, I have becom e increasingly concerned, som ewhat surpri singly in a sense to m yself, about what is loom ing out there in the Y2K area. My con cern centers m ainly on the increasing evid ence of potentia l illiqu idity pr oblem s, as peopl e in the business co mmunity and f inancial community keep talking to one another a bout possible year-end developm ents. Everybody seem s to be focusing on what they should do to protect them selves at year-end in a situation where the co st of appropriate p recautions is not perceiv ed to b e all that  large relativ e to the 8/24/99 73 cost of the potential outcom es. I think we are addressing the year-end issue, and I don’t believ e there is likely to  be a sign ificant prob lem in the f inancial area. However, even though I agree with Mike Pre ll that the declining inventory/sales ratios do not at this stage seem to have  caused a sense of  a shortf all, it is jus t not cred ible th at the tightness of just-in-tim e inventory managem ent that businesses have created in this country can continue, as we m ove ever closer to the end of the year, w ithout generating som e precau tionary buildup of various sup plies along v arious p ipelines. We’ve seen several surveys that suggest m any people are inclined to take such precautionary m easures. The crucial consideration is that we don’t need very much stocki ng up to create a quite large increase in s easonally ad justed inventory investm ent. Indeed, my recollection is that a one percent increase in real busine ss inventories is about $50 billion at an annual rate. And an increase of that order of m agnitude from  one quarter to the next adds m ore than 2 percen tage p oints to the GDP growth rate. An addition al one percen t chan ge in inven tories investm ent is not a big num ber. So even though my perception is that the Greenbook forecast is p robably righ t, the risk to the forecas t is on the ups ide and very  substantially so. The question that arises is how that inventory is going to be  financed. When I look at the nature of m arkets and how the flow of funds m ay emerge in the year-end period, I can envision som e potentially very worrisom e developm ents. I do not perceive that as a necessary or m ost likely outcom e. Indeed, I don’t believ e it will happen. But I think the risk is sufficiently large that I would very st rongly be in the group that wants to tighten up on m onetary policy today if for no other reason than that we want to go into a period like that with a s omewhat tig hter than loo ser policy s tance. As Don Kohn pointed out, we’ve not only ha d the June funds rate increase but we’ve also had a v ery sign ificant increase in the real  long-term  investm ent grade yield in recent months. Indeed, as I recall from  the charts I looked at yesterday, th e BAA real rate is up just about a full percentage point  since the beginning of the year . That’s a f airly subs tantial amount of ti ghtening that has taken p lace. My own perception is that it is likely to b e adequate for our purposes. The reason I think so  at this stage is that the outlook for rising inflation is still a forecast. If we look at the detailed data, as a num ber of you have pointed out, there is nothing there. In fact, th e twelve-m onth cha nge f or the core CPI excluding tobacco --wh ich had th at artificial, very sharp ri se last December--is well under 2 percent. I 8/24/99 74 think it is 1.7 percent. That is a m ore releva nt statistic, if we are goi ng to use the CPI, than any of the other num bers we’re looking at. But as I’ve argued before, I think the CPI is a flawed m easure of inflation. The personal c onsumption expenditure de flators are far more important an d not only b ecause of th e weight  differences, which are qu ite im portant. Indeed, a nu mber of the “com ponent” or “detaile d” price indices are fa r more accurate than those in the CPI. I think there is a question of which of the various broad-base d inflation indexes to use, but I agr ee with the Vic e Chair in th at I be lieve we have arrived at  price stability by any measure we can em ploy. And the argum ent that th e rate of inflation has stabilized I think is probably accurate, altho ugh it’s d ifficult to tell in  certain resp ects for reas ons I will g et to in a minute. The point is that we are at the le vel we need to be; it is  not as though we have stalled out at som e higher level of inflation and, therefore, will requ ire add itional effort to bring inflation down. The concerns that a lot of people around the ta ble have raised with respect to this issue I think are q uite valid. The oil p rice increas e has been m ore than we would have expected, certainly m ore than I would have expected. And you cannot just subtra ct energy out of your price indexes as though there is som e core  aberration in the way that you can with agriculture. In a certai n sense when food was a crucial issu e in the CPI and affected wages, taking food out of the CPI was questionable. But taking food out of the CPI now is not question able because it clearly is fairly exogenous . However, oil is no t. Oil even tually works its way into the core price indexes, through transp ortation costs, petrochem ical feedstocks, heating costs, and a va riety of other areas. So it is  not as though the oil price is extra ctable from the overall p rice ind ex; its im pact is just delayed. To be sure, oil--and energy m ore generally--doesn’t have the weight th at it had 20 years a go in the GDP, but it is still a prom inent force and, therefore, I would not dim inish its inflationary im plications. The inte rmediate m aterials of  the PPI are largely construc tion materials, which are being pressured by a very, very tight housing m arket. The nonres idential m arkets, as you all know, are weakening. Indeed, som e com pany reports show orders for construction equipm ent falling off; and even in the data on residential markets that we get from  the National Association of Hom ebuilders, a sam ple of large homebuilders shows a significant weakening in hom e sales in July. I would be a little ca reful transla ting th at into sta rts 8/24/99 75 because, as several here have m entioned, there is a very serio us invento ry problem  of new homes. Dem and has to fall a lot before it be gins to affect the st arts figure significantly. One elem ent that nobody has discussed--I’m not sure how important it is but it could becom e so--is owner-equivalent rent. As you know , it has been in the CP I at one-tenth of a percent per month for quite som e time. Some statistical technique s that we’ve em ployed, which endeavor to extract near-term  signals fr om that BLS procedure of using a six-m onth moving average, suggest that that figure m ay move up from  0.1 to som ething like 0.3 in the But it is a much sm aller f raction of  the PCE. So, while it m ay have an impact on the CPI if indeed our s tatistical p rocedures are accurate, it will have a very m uch more subdued effect on the PCE price index. The bottom  line on all of  this, however, is re ally the question of wages and wage costs and unit labor costs generally. We’ve a ll commented on th e ECI and average hou rly earnings. I think the ECI m ay be stronger than  is shown in the Greenbook, but it certainly is still below the rate of change of a year ago. The average hourly earn ings figure, which in increase reflected ch anges in th e mix and that  the fixed weight stru cture of wages probably rose less than that. But, funda mentally, the cr ucial issue is not what is happening to average hourly com pensation. I suspect that neither the average hourly earni ngs m easure nor the ECI is as useful as the aggregative data on em ploym ent costs per hour. Even though the latter m easure is a dub ious statistical calcu lation, it probably is m ore representative of reality because it takes into acc ount all of the secondary sources  of labor costs. So the annual rate of increase o f a little  over 4 percent that we’ve s een in that statistic is prob ably the best estim ate, in today’s context, of the real rate of wage increase. That gets us down to the question of what is ha ppening to productivity. From  the data I look at, I find no evidence yet th at the increase in the rate of growth of productivity has slowed at all. To be sure, the official published data for the second quarter, which showed productiv ity growth o f 1.3 percen t and will be revised to below 1 percent, would suggest a very significant slowing. The pr oblem  is that about 2 percentage points of that num ber reflects the change in the statis tical discrepancy. And that published second-quarter number is not in any way consistent with what we know is going on out in the real 8/24/99 76 world--nam ely, that while there m ay be som e evidence of  firming in prices, ther e is little evidence of corporate pricing power. I must say that the anecdotal reports I hear from people to w hom I talk--even though they do bring up the point of the lesser discounts-­suggest no really significant change  in pricing power on the part of com panies. If that is indeed the case and if oper ating domestic profit m argins ro se in the second quarter--we don’t have official data on that as yet but th e evidence points to an increase, judging from  all the individual com pany reports we see--certain  algebraic conclusions follow. Algebraically a stable price level and rising operating profit m argins necessitate  a dec line in the rate of change in un it cos ts. Since labo r costs are 70 percent of unit costs and the indications in the nonlabor cost area suggest only m odest declin es, it necessarily follows that the rate of incre ase in u nit labor cos ts dec lined in the sec ond quarter. And indeed th at is pr ecisely  what shows up on the incom e side in an evaluati on of costs and prices . As I’ve indicated previously, when we look at the nonf arm busine ss sector from the income side, we estim ate that over the last four quarters unit costs rose less than ½ percent. Unit labor costs were up about ¾ percent. The growth rate of incom e, of course, was also significantly stronger than the growth rate of product-based GDP. I will g rant that there are lots of argu ments about what that statistical dis crepancy is showing, but leaving that aside, I would say that we don’t even need to look at any of these data on the product or incom e side. We can infer a decline in un it labor costs wholly independently of those data. And no m atter what data we use on average hourly compensation, whether it’s average hourly earnin gs, the ECI, or the com pensation data, we still get rising increases in out put per hour. The figures in the data that we are looking at from  the incom e side show productivity grow th over the four quarter s ending in the second quarter of around 3½ percent. I might add th at the difference betw een the 3½ percent and the 4.3 percent in com pensation per hour is indeed  a unit labor cost increase of ¾ percent. The point that I’m  trying to m ake here is that we don’t have any real evidence that inflation h as risen. Indeed, we are still looking at declin ing rates of increase in unit co sts. And if profit m argins are rising, that  basically says that som e of the increase in prices or the lack of decline in prices has to be reflected in  widening profit m argins. So there is still a gap there. In other words, the inflationary pr essure is not there. Now, I don’t deny that if we proceed with the p roduct-based GDP numb ers and pro ject a stable p roductiv ity growth 8/24/99 77 rate, that will produce an  acceler ation  in the CPI g rowth rate . There is no algebraically conceivab le alte rnative to that. But that is  begging the ques tion, because u nless and un til we see som e slowdown in productivity growth, then th e argum ent that inflation is about to bite us is not credible. I do not deny, as I’ve said pr eviously, that the growth of output per hour is going to slow down, but I don’t know when. There is no evidence of that yet, and there is no reasonable upper lim it in the near term. The cruc ial point here is that we becam e so used to a 1 percent increase in productiv ity growth over a very long period of tim e--from  the ’80s into the ’90s--that we have looked at the gap between poten tial and actual as entirely a demand-side phenom enon. Certainly the dem ographics haven’t changed that m uch. And if we have stable dem ographics--say, a little m ore than 1 percent growth in the working-age population including imm igration--and a 1 percen t trend productivity growth rate, then potential is a little over 2 per cent. And if that does not cha nge, our evaluation of inflation can ignore the supply side and look at the dem and side, which is what we typically do and why we argue in term s of an overheating ec onomy. But now we have the supply side moving, and the question of whether the econom y is overheating and inflationary pressures are m ounting cannot be strictly an issue of wh at is happening on the demand side. That’s because if productiv ity is accelerating , of necessity it has to be balanced in som e manner, as I said last tim e, by very high expenditures for motor vehicles, housing, construction--big everything--unless we get a big statistical d iscrepancy--bigg er than the one we’re looking at now. The truth of the m atter is that we have a very strong econom y with very m arginal indications of any slowing. But the question that is still up in the air is whether, in f act, it is an overheating econom y. An important elem ent of that, obviously, is what is going on in the supply and dem and for labor. There is no qu estion that the pool of people seeking jobs is continuing to erode. We continue to s ee sh rinkage in th e num ber of those who are working part-tim e, so we are seeing ever increasing hours. But the rate of  decline in the pool of job-seeking people who haven’t gotten a job has itsel f been slowing. We know the gap between potential and real ou tput is in the area of less than ½ percent without claim ing any knowledge of what the actual  potential is because we don’t need to know that. All we need to know is the difference. 8/24/99 78 What I’m  suggesting is that we still s hould be  looking for the answer to th e question o f “Where is the inflation? ” It is not showing up anywhere in the basic price data, at least that I can tell. And the people out in the busine ss wo rld with who m I talk, and  it’s a f airly extensive group, keep complaining about their inability to raise prices. I do think that wages will con tinue to increas e if productiv ity growth c ontinues to rise. But s ince this would m ean that unit labor costs would be little changed, that won’t be a source of price pressures. In any event, having said all of that, so far as the dom estic side is concerned I think the availability of resources is ve ry tight. Inflation is clearly prone to acceleration should the increase in the growth of productivity slow or  even stabilize. That hasn’t happened yet as far as I can tell. Finally, let m e say something abou t the in ternational side, which is an issue a num ber of you have raised. I think som ething om inous is going on. It’s not the econom ics; it is the politics. The Vice Chair m entioned that, as did President Jordan. The situation in is deteriorating. I don’t mean the econom ics. On the contrary, the econom ics look fairly good, especially in But the econom ics are a lagging indicator. Mr. political strength has deteriorated very dram atically. As I recall, his approval ratings went down and he is being largely abandoned by a number of his strong supporters. It is very difficult to know what is going on in . The situa tion is te chnica lly bette r, but the politics there are jus t as bad. The long-lasting is obviously com ing to an end at the close of this particul ar session,  because no ne of the candidates sho ws any signs  of becom ing that type of president. So there is a possibility that we could be confronted with a crisis that ironically cou ld create ano ther pe riod of strength in the dollar as fears of the international political situation and other con cerns em erge. The flight to the dollar would resum e. I think one of the things we have learne d, to our chagrin, is th at the hardes t thing to forecast is th e Am erican exchange rate. I know how m uch effort Karen Jo hnson and her people have put into it, and thei rs is the m ost sophisticated an alytical p rocess you will ever see. And I can’t say that the re sult is all that im pressive. [Laughter] So if she can’t do it, I don’t th ink any of us ought to cons ider ourselves to be in a pos ition to do it. My bottom  line is that I think we have to  tighten by 25 basis poi nts. I would argue that we should m ake that m ove and stay with  symm etry, as I think Don Kohn m entioned. If 8/24/99 79 it turns out that we have to m ove again in October, symm etry does not preclude us from doing so. But we ought to be careful in the word ing of our press statem ent, if we go in that direction, not to construct an “asymmetric” symmetric directiv e, which we consciously and purposefully did the last tim e and for good reason . I would argue that that is probably not the desirable thing to do at th is point. I have gone on far longer than I anticipated. Who would like to speak next?  Vice Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH. Mr. Chairm an, I fully support your recomm endation. Let me just express a couple of thoughts. Since I believe that we are enjoying price stability and since I believe very firmly in the r ather b rilliant analy sis that you have just presented, one m ight ask: Why are we tightening at all?  In my view, the reason is that the dom estic econom y can certainly b ear it. The worst case scenario is that we will have m oved the funds rate up b y 25 basis p oints that we didn’t absolutely need. But the strength of the dom estic econom y and the tightness of the labor m arket are such that a m ove of 25 basis points is certainly a bit of insuranc e that is in the interes t of the Am erican people. Another reason--which you just alluded to, as I did in m y earlier rem arks--is that the international situation is tenuous enough that it is  best for us to be in the p osition of having domestic policy just where we want it or m aybe a tiny bit on the snug side. It will give us much greater flexibility to respond to any una nticipated weakness in the dom estic econom y, which is always possible, or to the m ore likely  event of som e shock com ing from  outside the United States. So I believe very firm ly that “C” symm etric is  the right solution.

MS. MINEHAN. I, too, very m uch agree with your recommendation, Mr. Chairm an. Although I m ight be a bit m ore inclined than ot hers to view the prospects for increases in interest rates as m ore probable rather than le ss pro bable, a t this point in tim e I th ink it is important to m ake a m ove and give som e indication of then standing pat for a while. I believe that would be very helpful in term s of overall m arket conditions. I think President McDonough is right on target in saying that it wo uld be to our advantage to have m onetary policy close to where we want it as we go into th e last part of the year, which is going to be a tricky period. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 8/24/99 80 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I support the recommendation for a 25 basis point increase. The m arket expects it and not to m ove at this point would confuse the m arket. As for Y2K issues, I think our position ought to be that as we appro ach the close of the year we won’t hesitate to change our polic y if necessary. After all, we have said again and again that we are ready for Y2K and the banking system  is ready. So there is som ething peculiar about saying that the Y2K issue has to be an absolute ly contro lling c onsidera tion. In my view if we have good reason to move, we should m ove. Y2K should be one of the considerations involved in any decision, and it m ight tilt us in the direction of not m oving. But I do not think we should foreclose m oving if there is  a compelling case to m ove. Obviously, we might see strains in the m arket that are greater than those that we now think are likely, in which case that would elevate the importance of Y2K considerations. My view is that over the last two year s, until the b eginning of  this year, f inancial conditions were quite accommodative and perhap s even expansionary. But that situation has changed . Rates are up. Money growth is s lower this year. I think we will be n ot very far from  where we ought to be with the increas e in the fed funds rate today. If we are starting out after today pretty cl ose to where we ought to be, I think we have to m ake clear to the m arkets that our future policy move s are going to be driven by what we see happening. And if we e nd up with more inflati on than we currently anticipate, we have to be ready to respond to that. That seem s very important to m e; we shouldn’t try to preordain or give any very firm  view about our policy direction in coming m onths. My preference is very strongly for a symm etrical directive. I firm ly believe that the defuse the speculation about that and try to get th e market to pay less attention to it. I think we ourselves around this table are unclear about what that clause  means. It is awkward for us as we talk to people around our  Districts and to the press to  have to stum ble and mum ble about what this clause that we voted on m eans. In my view, the best way to defuse this is for us to ado pt a symm etrical directiv e for the foreseeab le future until we ourselves are clear about what we m ean by that clause. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairm an, like Governor Meyer, I look forward to the debate on the new eco nomy and to seeing how the ac tual new econom y will play out. But the te st of 8/24/99 81 the new eco nomy will be m arred if  we burden it with interes t rate inc reases based only on demand side considerations without equal consid eration given to supply side factors. We had a productivity grow th rate of only 1.3 percen t, or even lower, in the second quarter--a period of rapid growth in hours worked--after it  averaged almost 4 percent in the previous two quarters. I expect to see the higher productivity growth trend show through as labor supply grow th slows. My guess is th at the true  productiv ity growth trend will tu rn out to be much closer to 3 percent than to  1 percent. Wages m ay in fac t rise even f aster than th at and unit labor costs m ay rise, but after years of a profit boom  and after years of an investment boom  that h as raised cap acity fas ter than out put, it seem s to me that higher wages are appropriate. I was taught that wage-push in flation does not occur through higher wages alone without validation from  monetary expansion. While we never know what the appropriate rate of m onetary expansion is , it is heartening that m oney growth has

MR. MOSKOW . Mr. Chairm an, I support your proposal for a 25 basis point increase and a symmetric directive. However, on the dire ctive I jus t want to a ssociate m yself  with what President Poole said about symm etry and asymm etry. In my view we should not be using that to ol for the foreseeab le future even  though I agree with Pres ident Stern in that I personally think the odds are that we are going to be incr easin g rates again  in the no t too distant future. In my view we should ju st make announcem ents regarding symmetry or asymm etry if we think they are appropriate. The language on the tilt is no longer useful.

I, too, would prefer to raise the funds rate ¼ point at this m eeting.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I support your recommendation for a ¼ point increase in the funds rate  and the continuation of the symme tric directive. I want to focus a bit, though, on the issue of whether we need not just a symmetr ic directive, but a “truly symmetric” directive. And I’m going to give a contrary perspective. The bond 8/24/99 83 move--that there are still further, though m odest, increases com ing down the road. I don’t think it would be particularly useful to us e the directive and our announcem ent to remove that expectation from  the bond m arket. Indeed, I think it is a very reasonable expectation. It involves the sam e kinds of considerations that we have talk ed about around this table. There is a lot of m omentum in the econom y. Labor m arkets are very tight. The supply shocks are beginning to dissipate. So, I think the task we have before us is a rather difficult one. We need to com bine the rate move, the t ilt, and the announcem ent so as not to put into place exp ectations of an imm ediate move--keep  our options open to be s ure--bu t not to squeeze ou t of the m arkets what I think is a very sensible and  rational exp ectation righ t now. I think we should try to be m arket neutral. Now, one reason that I support the symm etric directive is the reason that Presidents Poole and Moskow and others have noted. Right now we have the problem that symm etry and asymm etry seem  to m ean different things  to different m embers of this Comm ittee. Until we solve our in ternal prob lem, it is ve ry dif ficult to com municate ou r intention s to the public effectively. So, first things first. During the interim  while we clean this up, I think we have to be m ore reluctant to use change s in the tilt and, if possible, stick with a symmetric d irective. But again, the c halleng e is h ow to balanc e that appro ach with th e announcem ent so as not to convey an incorr ect set of expectations about our policy intentions going forward.

I also want to comment, although it is not to  be decided by this group, that I hope the Board will consider a catch-up increa se in th e discount rate. It is part and parcel of our total policy posture. A catch-up in th e discount rate w ould help to underscore and anchor, at least to som e extent, the policy adjustm ent that we m ade at the last m eeting and the one it appears as if we are about to m ake this m orning.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, I agree wi th your recom mendation to increase the rate. As far as the tilt is concerned, my positi on is still what it was before. I recognize all the issues that have be en raised here. But looking at al l of the inform ation we have and giving full weight to your comm ent that we are probably going to have to m ove at least one more tim e, given the way we have been operatin g, my sense is  that an asy mmetrical tilt toward tightening is better. If I m ay, I’d like to m ake one other comment a bout the tilt. I certain ly agree with w hat Bill Poole a nd others ha ve said abou t the ne ed to get our a ct together and m ake sure we all are on the sam e page. Nevertheless, there has been a sentim ent expressed by Jerry Jordan and others about not using a tilt in our directive, and I certainl y understand those argum ents. But I have a slightly different perspective on this. As I see it, under our current operating procedures monetary policy works to a very la rge extent by influencing the yield curve. One of the most im portant determ inants or channe ls of that influence is m arket expectations regarding our future policy actions. The key point  is th at tho se expec tations are always out there. In a s ense one co uld say th at there is always a m arket percep tion o f a tilt in one direction o r another o r of no tilt, whether we us e tilt language in the d irective or not--and if we do, whether we announce it or not. That is a key issue that we need to keep in m ind. And given that, the issue as I see it is how th at inevitab le market p erception of a tilt or the absence of a tilt gets determ ined. If we don’t use symmetric or asymm etric language in the directive at all--or if we do and don’t announce it--then those expectations would be form ed largely, and I think obviously appropriately, by the Chairm an’s public statem ents. They might also be influenced from  time to tim e by what som e of the rest of us say and more generally by  how m arkets guess we are going to  react to inco ming infor mation abou t the econom y. By telling the m arkets what our consen sus view is, it seem s to m e that we cut out a lot of that guesswork, or at l east som e of it. That should m ake it easier for m arkets to move ahead of our actions and create the ki nd of continuity and sm oothnes s in m onetary policy and its im plem entation that I r eferred to awhile ago in m y statem ent on the econom y. So, I just offer that perspective. 8/24/99 85 One quick final point: To my mind, an asym metric directive is a statem ent about a propensity. It has nev er really been, as I see it at leas t, an unc ondition al promise of  future FOMC action, and it never should be  interpreted as such  a prom ise. So, if we are going to use anything like that in the future, we need to m ake that clear.

MR. JORDAN. A large and rapidly growing trade deficit or current account deficit says to m e that dem and for products in the United  States has been growin g at an ever faster rate relative to the pace at which we can produce them . So far , we’ve been blessed by the savings of the rest of the world, as poor as th e rest of the world is, com ing to our benef it. That is unsu stainable. That will turn  around. They will want to take their savings ho me and we will need  to sta rt making our sav ings available to them . That m eans U.S. dom estic demand must slow. Current policy is not positioned to accom plish that. If the m ove today were desi gned to signal that w e’re on hold f or the balan ce of the year, m y preference would probably be to go ah ead and do 50 basis points and say this is a “we’re done” type action. That is really not m y first choice, though. My first choice is what Jack Guynn has suggested, a m ove on the discount rate. I think that is  more im portant. I’ve thought about an increase of 25 basis points on bo th rates but I like his idea of a catch-up, so I’d favor 25 basis points on the funds rate and 50 basis points on the discount rate.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. We h ave a c onsen sus on “C” s ymmetric, 2 5 basis points. Would you read the appropriate language?

MR. BERNARD. I’m reading from  page  15 of the Bluebook: “To promote the Comm ittee’s long-run o bjectives of price s tability and sustainable econom ic growth, the Comm ittee in the imm ediate future seeks condi tions in reserve m arkets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of  around 5¼ percent. In view of the evidence currently available, the Co mmittee be lieves that prospective developm ents are equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease in the federa l funds rate operating objective during the interm eeting period.”

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. At the term ination of this m eeting I’m  going to ask that the Board of Governors m eet separately to consider the requests of a very large num ber of the Reserve Banks to m ove the di scount rate up 25 basis points. In the event that the B oard goes along, I would propose to re lease the following statement w ith respect to our decisions: The Federal Open Marke t Comm ittee today voted  to ra ise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5¼ percent. In a related action, the B oard of  Governors approved a 25 basis point increase in the discount  rate to 4¾ percent. With financial m arkets functioning more norm ally, and with persistent strength in dom estic dem and, foreign econom ies firming, and labor m arkets rem aining very tight, the degree of monetary ease required to address the global financial m arket turm oil of last fall is no longe r consistent with sustained, noninflationary, econom ic expansion. Today’s increase in the federal funds rate, together with the policy a ction in June an d the f irming of  conditio ns m ore generally in U.S. financial m arkets over recent m onths, should a consequen ce, the d irective th e Fed eral Open M arket Committee adopted is symm etrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term. In taking the discount rate act ion, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests subm itted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Bo ston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richm ond, Atlanta, Chi cago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. The discount rate is the in terest rate that is charged dep ository ins titutions  when they borrow from  their District Fed eral Res erve Banks. There is one additional item  on the agenda, which addresses the que stion of  the tilt. Bill Poole a nd a num ber of  other Committee m embers have raised the qu estion as to whether the Comm ittee shouldn’t com e to an agreem ent on what the tilt language in the 8/24/99 87 directive really m eans. This has always b een an awkward question, but obviously it has taken on added im portance with our announcem ents. Most of  us are also at least slightly uncomfortable with how the new announcem ent policy has been working out in practice and wonder if it m ight not benefit from  at least so me tinkering. I don’t think we can resolve any of these interrelated issues at this m eeting. In fact, I would pref er to have considerably m ore experience u nder our co llectiv e belts before m aking any new decisions on these m atters. But I do thin k it is im portant to get a proce ss under way to review the language of the directive, its m eaning, and what we announce. That’s the reason I asked Don Kohn to add this top ic to the agenda a t the last m inute. What I propose is that R oger Ferguson h ead a s mall subcommittee of the FOMC to exam ine these issues an d com e back with som e recomm endat ions or at least cho ices for us to consid er. Roger will consult the Presiden ts and Board mem bers to com e up with the other m embers of this subcomm ittee. Theirs will be no easy task and it will benefit from added experience, as I already noted. My incl ination is to ask Roger and his colleagues to get back to us in early spring. Is that satisf actory to everybody ? You have all raised the issue in one form or another, and we have to com e to som e form of agreem ent on what to do about it. Having said that,
