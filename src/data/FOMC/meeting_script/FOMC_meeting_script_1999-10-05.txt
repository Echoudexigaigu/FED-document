CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objec tion, they are approved. Mr. Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I will be referring  to the package of colored charts that should be in f ront of you. 1/ I offer the array of forward rates sh own in the first chart as a precau tion against any thought that there is a sim ple, single description of interest rate expectations, given the pronounced Y2K eff ects we’re seeing in conjunction with some shifts in expectations about the outlook around the world. In broad brush strokes, you can see in the top panel of this chart that U.S. rates drifted sideways after your last m eeting and then m oved a b it lower before ticking up late last week on som e data releases that suggested c ontinued strength in dem and in the U.S. econom y. Euro rates have m oved up m ore or less consistent ly since your last meeting. And they increased quite a bit at th e end of last week, as forecasts for Euro area g rowth were rev ised up and as th e market becam e filled with th e thoug ht that the European Central Bank m ight actually rais e rates before the end of this year. Japanese forward rates generally declin ed throughout the pe riod and were down substantially  until the sp ecula tion around the time of the Bank of Japan’s Septem ber 21st policy m eeting created som e noise. But clearly, the show was stolen by the current 3-m onth Libor rates, which are usually the sleepy fl at line at the bottom . As we m oved into the fourth quarter and the end dates of that contract included the turn of the year--both the Decem ber 31st and January 3rd dates--those rates shot up. Now, this m ay be just a brief effect and m ay cal m down a bit, as we have seen with other Y2K spikes over the past year. I hope so, but I don’t think we know in any way for certain. There is also, as you can see particularly  in the Euro rate chart, a sort of fanning out of these rates as one reflection of the uncertainty. Anecdotally our traders report, as we have m oved into the fourth quarter, increas ingly diverse pricing by our counterparties for a num ber of inst ruments--sort of idiosyncratic firm approaches to pricing for the year-end. Some firm s think one thing is going to happen and other firm s think som ething com pletely different is going to happen. So a lot of the data sources we look at--the data points we take of f of Bloom berg, for exam ple--are going to be the blended averages  of som e very disparate rates as firm s take increasingly idiosyncratic approaches to the uncertainties about the year-end. And I think we should be even m ore cautious than usual in interp reting these interest rate charts. 1/ A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Fi sher is appended to the transcript. 10/5/99 2 Turning to the second page, the top pane l shows exchange rates since the start of the year: yen per Euro in green; yen pe r dollar in red on the left-hand scale; and dollars per E uro in blue on the right-hand s cale. Interestingly, the two scales happen to match in percen tage term s with a slightly  different location of the decim al. When I look at this chart, what I see is the he rding behavior of Japanese institutional investors rushing back into the yen in th e third qu arter. You c an see th e shift beginning at the tim e of our m eeting on J une 30th. Now, it may be that econom ic funda mentals change abruptly with calendar quarters, but to  my way of t hinking it is much more likely that it is investor beha vior that changes abruptly with calendar quarters. I don’t know what to expect w ith this change of calendar quarters, but when I look at the third-quarter  picture I see a rush of Japanese investors back into the yen. The bottom  panel dep icts 1-m onth option implied volatilities  on each of these exchange rate pairs. If there are anxi eties being expressed in foreign exchange far this year. As you can see, the green and red yen-based volatilities tracked one another and spiked as we cam e to the e nd of the third quarter . The euro/do llar implied volatilities traded at a rather calm  pace. Turning to page 3 and dom estic open m arket operations, during the three maintenance periods since your last m eeting, with the exception of last Thursday and Friday, the fed funds  market behaved in  a fairly typical and calm  manner. The deviation of the effective rate from  the targ et and the in tra-day volatility, expressed in the standard deviation, we re both moderate and sim ilar to the experience of other recen t months. Last Th ursday, Septem ber 30th, was actually  a fairly typical m onth-end day. Friday, October 1st, also a day of  big f lows in the m arket, was a little les s typical. We ended up providing sufficient re serves on the day to have the effective rate trade on the target, as  you can see with the red horiz ontal tick right on the dotted line. But in doing so we clearly provided a sufficiency of reserves that was m ore than the m arket looked f or in term s of the standard deviation, and we had a very wide trading range and a whopping 60 basis poi nts standard deviation of the trading range. But that’s in effect what it takes to try to get the fed funds rate to trade on average at th e targ et on a day of volatile paym ent flows. I’d just note that currency in circulati on has continued to grow at a rather rapid clip of  about 10 percent per year. That is consistent with the rates w e have seen this year, but well ahead of past y ears. I don’t know about the Board’s staff, but we have not found any evidence sugges ting that consum er dem and for currency is Y2K-related. We do see what app ears to be som e stockpiling of currency by small banks in anticipation of consum er demand, but we don’t yet see anything we could pinpoint as indicative of  consum er de mand for notes. Turning to the next page, the fourth ch art dep icts spreads on s elected long er-term instru ments to comparable U. S. Treas uries. I included this chart to em phasize the noticeab le im pact on Septem ber 8th when we announced our special y ear-end 10/5/99 3 operations and again on Septem ber 14th when  we had a m eeting with the prim ary dealers to discuss the details of our operation and get som e feedback. You can see that both of those events seem ed to ha ve had a pronounced effect, particularly on mortgage-backed spreads, the 10-year sw ap spread, and the F annie Mae benchm ark, but they obviously had hardly any effect on the corporate index. I want to be careful not to overstate the im pact. Our announ cement cam e just a few days after Labor Day when traders were com ing back and were  likely to bring more volume into the going to unwind at some point in Septem ber absent som e exogenous shock. We little m ore quickly than they m ight have co me down otherwis e. But all in  all we were plea sed with the m arket reac tion to our announcem ent and we received quite a lot of feedback on it. In the next few pages I have outlined so me notes to try to take you through a number of issues associated with our y ear-end operations. Forgive m e for this format, but I thought it would be the most  efficient way. With respect to the expanded collateral, tri-party, and longe r-term  operations, we’ve now completed the legal documents. The basic operational proc edures are in place a nd we expect in the next few days to be able to start the tr i-party operations with  a broader array of collateral. I want to be quite blunt that I think we are going to scuff our knees a few times as we try to figure out the best way to do this. We have different classes of collateral, and a num ber of dealers have ur ged that we provide separate pricing for each of the m ajor types of collateral.  At the sam e time, there is a differen ce between tri-party settlem ent and fed-wire settlem ent, and som e other dealer s want us to price that. We cannot do all of those things at on ce. It would just be  an operational rat’s nest if we tried to do all that. So we are going to learn som ething from  doing and we will jus t try to g et a feel for how we can slice  the oper ations to try to let the dealers price as efficiently as possib le. Another point is that I’d like to anno unce the p ricing details of the Desk’s temporary operations. By tradition, the Desk  has not announced the lowest repo rate at which we operate nor any deta ils of dealer prop osition s. The philosoph y has been that we’re managing quantities of reserves  and that there is no operational--and certainly no policy --signif icance to th is stop -out rate, or lowest  rate at which we operate. However, given the intense interest  in turn-of-the-year financing rates and to avoid rumors about rates paid on our ope rations, I’d like to begin announcing the details of  rates subm itted in our oper ations, both f or repos and  matched sales. It would be possible to limit th ese announcem ents just to those operations that span the yea r-end . But I think  trying to mainta in tha t distin ction would be awkward and probably unsustainable given de aler interest in p ricing other tim e horizons, not just the turn-of-the-year period. Moreover, a num ber of central banks now routinely provide this inform ation and, taking a step back and thinking about it, I concluded that we also should provide this inform ation. I would pl an to include a review of this announ cement practice in March of next year when we present th e Committee with a com plete review of  our year-end operations. 10/5/99 4 At the top of  page 6 I have listed in detail what we propose to announce after each operation: the rang e of repo rates s ubmitted by deale rs; the to tal vo lume of propositions  subm itted; the stop-ou t rate, i. e. the lowest repo rate accepted ; the volum e-weighted ave rage of  repo ra tes ac cepted ; and the vo lume of proposition s that we accepted, and thus the reserv es we injected. The latter we have been announcing for som e time now. We woul d make sim ilar announcem ents on the breakdown of infor mation on m atched sales used in reserve draining operations. And, obviously, if we have different cl asses of pricing, we would m ake the announcem ents for each class of collateral th at we price. Turning to the standby financing facility in the options proposal, we received a num ber of comments from  the dealers and we sent the dealers another revision to that program last W ednesday, which I ci rculated to you in m emo for m last Wednesday. I would plan to announce the details of those au ctions also. Along with the results of the auctions, we would provide pricing infor mation to the dealers, the rang e of bids subm itted, the volu me of bids subm itted, th e lowest b id accepted-­which in the Dutch auction would be wher e all awards are p riced--and th e volum e-weighted av erage of all accepted bid s. Consisten t with our p ractice of announcing the am ount of reserves injected, we woul d also plan to announce the dollar volum e of options exercised each day during th e period of tim e when options can be exercised. We’ve received from  the dealer community and from  other market participants a fairly wide range of indi cations of the potential dem and for these options. If one listened to the m oney m arket mutual fund m anagers and som e of the big corporate players in financing market s, one would think we would be writing $100 billion or $150 billion of these options . Making a guesstim ate on the basis of listening to the CFOs of dealer firm s, the num ber of options we would write would measure roughly in the tens of billions, proba bly in the several tens of billions. If one listened just to the repo dealers, who are very picky and think these things are deeply out of the m oney and rather a nuisan ce, they suggest that we m ight need to provide an amount in the $5 billion to $20 b illion range. So we have a full range of reactions f rom the m arket. Just in the  last few days, in response to our revised proposal, we’ve gotten the sens e of the dem and going up a little even in the CFO community--the ones who really do want to take out the flood insurance. And I think we’ve structured this whole package on the prem ise that we’re going to m eet demand. We’re go ing to  sell enough for that constituency to b e comfortable. So, we m ay need to revise up the am ounts for our  initial auction that I put in the revision last week and m ake those a li ttle higher. Inevitably, we’re going to need to adjust to the dem and as it b ecom es eviden t in the firs t auction and over the series of  auction s. But I’d like to be clear, since m eeting demand is one of our objectives, that an unfilled auc tion is not go ing to be an em barrassment but one s ign of  succe ss. We’re not looking for a high bid-to-cover ratio he re but rather the opposite. We’re trying to meet the communities’ dem and. After we have launched the expanded co llateral and tri-party operations and the stand-by  financing f acility auc tions on repos, we will then  turn our a ttention and 10/5/99 5 the dea lers’ atten tion to the prac ticalities of late-day operations and possibly provide options on m atched sale transactions. As I noted on the last page of m y package, some dealers and som e money m arket fund m anagers have continued to press us to write options on m atched sales and revers e repos. The longer one scratches the surface of th at, though, it is clear  that the im pulse behind that  request is the desire of the m oney m arket funds to save a f ew basis points. It really is n’t an issue of the functioning of m arkets; they’d just rather ge t a slightly higher ra te of return. We will con tinue to listen to their views once we get the ot her pieces in p lace and will talk abou t this som e more. But m y interes t has s hifted to ju st trying to en sure tha t we have the flexibility to add or drain re serves on any day. Even som e of the m oney each day, th at really add resses their concer n, ev en if we are n ot addres sing their individu al set of leaky p ipes, if you will. But if dem and for Treasury securities becom es sufficiently high to push the general collateral rate on overnight re pos toward zero for a prolonged period of time, that co uld create a negativ e spill over on confidence and the functioning of financing markets. If that were the case, we m ight then want to consider undertaking m atched sale or reverse repo tran sactions in order to add to the supply of Treasury colla teral availab le in th e market. But we’d look at the system ic issue of the functioning of the m arkets, not whet her som e money m arket funds feel they are m issing out on a few basis points in their return. Mr. Chairm an, we had no foreign excha nge operations during the period. I will need th e Comm ittee’s ratif ication of our dom estic operations. I wou ld be happy to answer questions on any aspect of my report, incl uding our year-end operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Questi ons for Peter?  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Peter, with respect to the la st point, I rem ember that about a year ago-­or maybe not that long ago--we talked about your  securities lending program . Are you going to use that at all in the year-end pr ogram ? Would you use that if you had a shortage of collateral? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Earlier this summ er we raised  the am ounts we’re auctioning off through that program  and it is in a sense on autopilot. Without  getting too far into the arcana, that program actually is one of the things I’m  worried about. We price that at a negative spread, 150 basis points off of the general collateral rate. If the gene ral collateral rate were to trad e down toward zero because of the scarcity o f Treasury collateral, we could be ru nning with a negativ e rate there, which we would have to think through. That’s not somewhere we’d want to go. While that’s on autopilot and will be available to the dea lers, it rea lly will not addres s a system ic issue-- if, say, all Tr easury securities were trading at such a prem ium that th ey were being financed at rates approaching zero. It helps at the m argin, but it is not  going to be an answer. That’s one of the issues of concern. We are consistently providing supply through that pr ogram  at predictable am ounts, which we spent a 10/5/99 6 long tim e designing it to do. The dealers are happy w ith that. If we divert  our supply of Treasury bills into so me intervention in th e market, we’ll then be crimping what we can put ou t through that structured program . So that’s exactly one exam ple of  the issu es tha t create com plexities f or us in the m atched sale a rea. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Don Kohn in the Bluebook disc ussion and you in your discussion of the weekly data referred to the rath er po sitive impact, in term s of spreads and  so forth, of your announcem ent of these year-end facil ities to deal with Y2K uncerta inties. But there has been a bounceback subsequent to that. What do we know about that?  Is that Y2K-related or is it reflective of credit m arket conditions? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I think two factors are involved that are hard to put one’s finger on. Traders at many different firm s have talked to us about the fact that our options program  provided them some relief  but in th eir m inds provided the Comm ittee with more f lexibi lity to ra ise rates in fed funds fut ures pricing. The other f actor  is that as we a pproached September 30th, a whole host of contracts--like the 3-month Li bor I showed on m y first chart--t hen captured the year-end date. And all sorts of rates traded up in  sympathy with that year-end pressure--som e rationally and some pricing. Those are the two stories that I can cite. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. But do you really have a sens e that som e of the--I don’t know how to characterize it--feeding frenzy or hysteria has abated a bit? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. The dealer firm s certainly now feel  a little m ore com fortable that they have a flexible tool or “flood insurance” to m anage their balance sheets at  the end of the year. I think that has put them  in the position th at they can’t turn around and tell their custom ers, “Gee, we just can’t do anything for you.” It has forced that discussion, rather awkwardly, clearly onto price. That m ay be having a spillover effect in som e of the interest rate markets. It is all abo ut price now; it’s no t abou t availability . That’s how I would put it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Conc erning the issue of liquidity, is “f lood insurance” the appropriate langua ge? [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. I’m sorry. I got that term  in my mind in late August and I should take it out again. I have som e neighbors who had som e serious flood dam age who didn’t have flood insurance. 10/5/99 7 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Call it drought insurance. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I would just add that I think one important re ason the swap spread cam e down and stayed down was the ann ouncem ent effect s on the m ortgage-b acked secu rities m arket in particular, which is closely relate d to the swap m arket. But anot her reason was that the flood of issuance that had been anticipated fo r Septem ber really did not happen. And one of the things we’re hearing is that issuers are a little m ore re laxed about the possibility of com ing to m arket in get all their financing done before Septem ber was ove r or at least before O ctober was over. At the very least one could say that the frenzy hasn’t gotten any worse. Things may have calm ed down a little. But th e spreads th at you ci ted suggest th at people are still being very, very cau tious about extending credit--particu larly unsecured short-term cred it over the turn of the year. That is where the risks are. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Furthe r questions for Peter?  If not, who would like to move approval? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Move a pproval of the dom estic operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objection they are approved. Shall we m ove to the staff reports of Mr. Pr ell and Ms. Johnson? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. As we noted in the Greenbook, the in formation received since the last meeting has strongly confirm ed the notion th at the low GDP growth  reported for the second quarter grossly overstated any moderating tendencies in the econom ic expansion. Indeed, the data available as of  last Wednesday persuaded us to raise our sights regarding the pace of output growth  over the second half--bringing us back up to the 3.7 percent Q4/Q4 total that we discussed in the m idyear Chart Show. The incom ing statistica l data and th e anecdotal ev idence foun d in the Beigebook paint a fairly consistent picture of robust private dom estic dem and in recen t months. Consumer spending has continue d to ris e at a fairly brisk pace, with the advance of light vehicl e sales to around the 17  million un it mark underscoring that households rem ain confident enough to  tap into their accumulated assets or borrow to finance their purchases. The sam e positiv e fundam entals seem to have buoyed the residential real estate m arket well into th e summ er in the face of higher m ortgage rates. The initial estim ate of August new hom e sales that wa s released late last week and showed them  rising monotonically since the spring, likely was biased upward by som e technical p roblem s. But, that s aid, it’s our as sessment that dem and for hom es will 10/5/99 8 be subsiding only gently over the remainde r of the year and that a backlog of projects will help to sustain building activity. The biggest surprise of the third qua rter was th e apparent acceleration of business fixed investm ent. I say “apparent”  because there are considerable gaps in the source data in hand, and these numbers can  be quite erratic. But the strength of the com puter and communications equipm ent industries seem s pretty clear, and shipm ents from  that sector lik ely paced a large in creas e in ov erall equipm ent spending. Finally, on the private spe nding side, the fragm entary evidence suggests that invento ry investm ent picked up this summ er from the very lo w pace of the second quarter. Still, by all reports, stocks rem ain comfortable, if not lean, overall, leaving room  for fur ther app reciable ac cumulation in the com ing m onths. All told, then, there’s no reason to d oubt that dom estic dem and has retained substantial p ositiv e momentum  into the fall. Moreover, as Karen will be d iscuss ing, improving foreign econom ies are giving an increasing lift to our export sales. Though some of the demand in the econom y is leaking abroad in a very steep rise in imports, there’s enough left over to this point  to provide am ple im petus to dom estic production. Indeed, under the circum stances, one  might reasonably ask whether our projection of a slackening in the pace of expansion in the com ing year, with only a little further policy tightening, is realistic. In responding to that question, I want to  begin by noting that, as im pressive as the econom y’s strength has been of late, it  does appear that th e expansion actually growth thus far this year has been about 3½ percent, at an annua l rate, versus the 4¼ percent increase registered in 1998 as a w hole. Granted, this is a thin reed statistically--perhaps esp ecially on th e eve of a major revision of the national incom e accounts--but it’s certainly not at  odds w ith our longsta nding expectation of Furtherm ore, a little of the strength in  dem and we’ve observed lately could be a Y2K phenom enon, and thus inherently tr ansitory. We highlighted in the Greenbook our hunch th at the recen t surge in computer sales was in part sim ply a more exaggerated version of the story of infor mation system  remediation and then lock-down than we previously had allowed for. Likewise, it’s also possible that the econom y is already beginning to feel the effects of Y2K-inspired precautionary stocking by households and businesses. That said, I wouldn’t push either of those points very  far. And I’d give at least as m uch consideration to what m ay be one of the m ajor upside risks to our forecast of moderating aggregate dem and in  the interm ediate term . As we’ve emphasized, that forecast hinges im portantly on the flat path f or equity prices that 10/5/99 9 we have anticipated. To be sure, past, and what we have assum ed to be prospective, incre ases in inte rest rates  imply som e restrain t on activ ity go ing forward. However, that restraint--occurring ag ainst a backdrop of a deprec iating dollar, a rebounding world economy, and a som ewhat m ore expans ive fiscal policy --doesn’t seem  great enough to outweigh the im petus to dem and that would be supplied by a resum ption of a stock market rise even rem otely rese mbling the averag e perform ance of the past few years. As we indicated in the Greenbook, we can  see a rational basis for anticipating an even wea ker m arket than we’ve b uilt into  our forecast, bu t we’ve said the sam e in the past, only to be trampled by the bulls of W all Street. From a policy standpoint, it would seem a central issue whether you wa nt to bet on th is recen t correction being a major break-point in the m arket trend, or whether you will want to take the initiative yourselves to impose som e added restraint on dem and. Obviously, there would be no reason to  worry about restraining dem and if it weren’t for the danger of  an unsatisfactory inflation outcom e. In our forecast, that danger is m anifest. However, a forecast is a forecast; it’s not a fact. And the facts are am biguous at this point. The broadest measures of goods and services inflation have picked up this year, but if one parses the indexes, the story is the sharp reversal of oil prices. Indeed, som e measures of  “core inflation” have even slow ed--for exam ple, the CPI excluding food and energy. One m ust of course ex ercise som e caution in engaging in such slicing and dicing in the effort to assess the underlying trends. It usually m akes sense to try to filter ou t the noise in sho rt-term movem ents in indexes like th e overa ll CPI tha t stem s from  erratic elem ents like energy prices; but this b ecomes an increasingly risky approach when you do it over ever-lengthening tim e spans. At som e point, you have to take the overall price m easures as the better indication of the m acro phenom enon of inflation. Put differently, over tim e the m ovements in  energ y prices influence thos e of other prices--either through their effect on production and distribution costs or as a factor influencing wages. In this regard, la st year’s sharp drop in oil prices probably contributed significantly to this year’s favorable wage and price perform ance, and this year’s even sharper run-up in oil pri ces is likely to leave its m ark on wages and core prices in com ing quarters. We can already see some of that eff ect in the behavior of interm ediate materials prices. The PPI for core interm ediate mater ials has r isen cons iderably in recen t months and the S eptem ber jump in the NAPM index of prices paid probably bodes ill for the PPI m easure in the near term . Items for which petroleum is an im portan t input have played a significant part in this surge . But oil isn ’t the only f actor. Another is the st rengthening of foreign econom ies and the peaking of the dollar on exchange m arkets. These have brought a cessation of the declines in core non-o il import prices that we enjoyed in 1998 and 10/5/99 10 early 1999. This undoubtedly has contributed to the pickup in “pipeline” inflation. If our expectations about foreign growth and the do llar prove correct, one can anticipate a further lessening of  the disinflationary force from the external sector. That still leaves the crucial ques tions of productiv ity and com pensation. Recent prod uctiv ity dev elopm ents have been pretty m uch in line with wh at we would expect, given the strength of out put and our basic assumptions about the “trend” of output per hour. On the other ha nd, they cannot be said to rule out a still more optim istic view that structural imp rovem ents in efficiency are in an ongoing escalation, which m ight translate into a temporarily m ore favorable trade-off between une mploym ent and inf lation . This is one of the issues that we shall have to review carefully when we get the revise d NIPA data at the end of the m onth. As regards p ay rates, the most recen t average hou rly earnings figures have shown no intensification of wage inflation-- quite the contrary. But there have been some disturbing signs as well. On the bene fits side, it’s beco ming increasingly clear that health insurance p remiums are in a substan tial acceleration. And the recen t auto agreem ents, com ing on the heels of the Boeing settlem ent, suggest that labor has gained som e bargaining power in a ti ght economy. With Congress seemingly headed for an agreem ent to raise th e minimum wage next year and this year’s higher consum er price inflation likely to be show ing through in pay decisions, there is in our view a likelihood that nom inal compensation will accelerate. Thus, though there clearly are m any inte resting things going on in term s of technological innovations and other change s in the business environm ent, under the present circum stances we think the odds fa vor an upward drift in inflation over our projection period. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. The ba sic m essage fro m the external sector this round is that economic activity in the rest of the world seem s to be strengthening even m ore than we--an d most other forecaste rs--had expec ted. There we re seve ral po sitive surprises co ncerning activity in the s econd quarter, such as s mall, positiv e real GDP growth in Japan and double-digit growth in som e emerging market econom ies in Asia. Some signs to the contrary--for exam ple in Brazil the recent weakening of production and court decisions just announced on Monday that appear to be at least a partial set-back in th e fiscal reform  process --hav e tem pered our optim ism. Nonetheless, on balance we have raised our projection for foreign output growth through next year and we expect additional firm ing in 2001. As described by Peter F isher earlier, the yen/dollar rate  fluctuated quite widely during the interm eeting period. In pa rt, these fluctuations reflect swings in views on the current cyclical position of  the Japanese econom y and its outlook for growth over the res t of this year and n ext. The po sitive chang e in second -quarte r real GDP reinforced the impact of the very la rge first-qua rter num ber and contributed to a general reassessm ent in asset m arkets and am ong forecasters, including the staff. Moreover, som e indica tors that have been  released s ince the Greenbook was com pleted suggest that we m ay still have been overly cautious in 10/5/99 11 our thinking about the very near term for the Japanese econom y. During August, industrial production surged and housing st arts posted an unexpectedly strong rebound from July’s steep decline. Unemployment edged down in August. However, the Tankan survey of business confidence, just released yesterday, seem s to have partly disappointed the m arkets. Whereas there was a sizable, positiv e swing in sentiment f or large manufactur ing firms, outside this sec tor and f or the to tal ind ex the sh ift was m uch less. Importantly, firm s in the survey continue to plan large cuts in fixed investm ent expenditures, consistent with their outlook for negligible sales growth. On balance, we judge our upward rev ision to the f orecast for real outpu t growth in Japan to be appropriate and we  might even shade up the num bers for the rest of th is year and bo th 2000 and 2001 in respo nse to th e addition al data. Neverthe less, we reta in the view tha t expansion will slow f rom its rap id first-ha lf pace to arou nd 1 to 1½ percen t over the fo recast p eriod. That assessm ent reflects our continued serious concer ns about the underlying streng th of Japanese dom estic demand, particularly private investm ent, given headwinds from  corporate restructu ring, persis tent difficultie s in th e financial sector, and possible loss  of confidence as a result of yen a ppreciation over the past year. There have also been so me additional positive indicators for near-term activity in Europe and Canada in the pa st few days. Canadian production in the third quarter appears to be above expectati ons. The latest survey data for the United Kingdom  and the euro area reinforce the upward revisions that we m ade to their forecasts an d suggest po ssible up side risk for real output g rowth in Euro pe. This recent evidence confirm s a stronger picture for prospects in the industrial countries and com plements the substantial upward revision we m ade to the Greenbook forecast for the Asian developi ng econom ies. With foreign o utput-­aside from  small fluctuations owing to Y2K--set to grow somewhat below  the extrem ely rapid rate of the firs t half of this year but at a robu st pace ov er the forecas t period, we see U.S. export volum es expanding at rates m uch above the pace of last year and the first half of this year. The change in the rela tive cyclical po sition s of the United Sta tes and our trading partners is one of the factor s behind our thinking in incorpora ting a depreciation  of the dollar in to the forecast. With other g lobal problem s attracting reduced attention, we expect that the large and expanding U. S. external deficits will contribute to  market sen timent for declines  in the dollar as well. With no basis on which to predict the tim ing of an abr upt dollar change, we have projected a moderate move down in real term s of the exchange value of the dollar spread over the forecast period. This dollar deprec iation shou ld add to the projected improve ment in our export perform ance. As a co nsequence, we see the external sector as co ntinuing to s ubtract from GDP growt h, but at a m uch reduced pace, over the forecast period. 10/5/99 12 We’d be happy to answer any questions.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Ques tions ? President McTee r. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. We keep hearing th at the yen’s appreciation is a result of expectations of a stronger Japanese economy. You just indicated sort of the opposite as far as the United States is concerned --that the chan ge in re lative cyclical  position s is ex pected to ca use the do llar to depreciate. Why the difference? Why is Japane se strength supposed to  strengthen the yen and relative U.S.  weakness weaken the do llar? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON. Well, I think the directions are consistent. Gene rally speaking I would attribute it to expectations about  the interest rate consequences  of stronger activity in the one econom y, not necessarily weaker activity in the Unite d States. The relative change is all that is needed. If the rest of th e world begins to operate  closer to capacity, those countries will experience a rise in in terest rates owing to  dem and effects and to possible m onetary policy responses that will come. We’ve already seen rum ors in the m arkets about action by the European Central Bank, with some people even specu lating that it will com e as ear ly as Th ursday. That seem s to be very ea rly in the process of som e strengthening in Europe. But it’s th at expecta tion of relative m onetary policy m oves and relative interest rate changes th at would feed through into the exchange rates. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Capital accounts are becom ing more im portant than current accoun ts? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Well, more im portant, less im portant. The current account goes the sam e way in that such a m ove in exchange rates woul d tend to lessen surpluses that are apparent in Europe and Japan and rem edy to som e extent deficits  in the United Sta tes. So in tha t sense these factors are not in conflict but ar e just reinforcing one another.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Karen, the recen t Greenbook for ecast of real GDP for China indicates growth of 3.4 percent in 1999 and 5.4 percent in the year 2000. Of course, those growth rates are much below what China had experienced in the previ ous five years or longer. Is that consistent with a gradual, as opposed to a sharp, decline in  the value of the renm inbi, continued refor m of state owned enterprises, and fu rther f inancial m odernization? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON. In our view, the Chinese aut horities will m ake a discretionary decision about the renm inbi. Because of th eir very strong  reserv e position a nd the fact that they are still running surpluses, we don’t see m arket forces triggering an event ther e. So the decision that they will m ake at som e point in tim e to in troduce som e flexibility in their exch ange rate is som ething 10/5/99 13 over which they have m ore control than som e other m onetary authorities m ight have. Even so, they m ay decide to m ake a one-step adjustm ent. We are not presum ing to rule that o ut. It is ju st impossible for us to know whether that could be thei r choice and when they m ight actually act. So, for forecast purposes we tend to pu t in a sm ooth adju stment, but in no sens e does that m ean that we are be tting that tha t is th e way it will necessa rily happen and that it will no t happen in one or two steps. It is the political pro cess within China that m ight lead to a quicker reaction, as slower growth creates pressures on em ployment and standards of living a nd political support for different factions in C hina. As the effort to continue re forms for the state-owned e nterpr ises is in conf lict with tha t--and to cre ate a source of dem and to offset perhaps the sp illovers from the dilemm as with the state-owned enterprises--I think they would choose at som e point to introduce som e exchange rate flexibility. But exactly when and how is m ore than we are prepared to take a position on.

MR. PARRY. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I’d like to pursue a bit m ore th e question that Bob McTeer raised about the role of the current accou nt. We certainly do hear  discussion about the ex change value of the dollar moving in the direction of becom ing weaker, given that the U.S. current account is in such a substantial deficit. Let m e focus on Japan and gi ve you a back of the enve lope calculation, which I am sure you can correct, to convey the nature of my thinking on this. Japan, of course, has a large curren t acco unt surplu s. But m y instinct is that to  a larg e extent that reflects th e fact that the econom y has been so weak and, therefore, im port demand is weaker than it otherwise would be. Let’s suppose--and this is the back of  the enve lope calculation that you can fix--that Japan is operating at 10 percent below potential in terms of output, and suppos e its propensity to im port is 0.15. If Japan were operating at full capacity, im ports would be 1½ percent of GDP higher and its curren t acco unt surplu s would be a whole lot lo wer. And the case for th e yen to app reciate would be weaker b ecause the current accou nt surplu s would sudden ly look quite different if Japan were importing a whole lot m ore. Obviously, this analysis applies to the Unite d Stat es as well. In part, the deficit in our curren t account reflects the fact that exports have been w eaker than anticipated because so m any econom ies around the world h ave not bein g doing very  well. So, although it is true that revival abro ad will rais e interest rates abroad and its e ffect on the capital account will tend to weaken th e dollar, it is  also true th at the d emand for U.S. goods will ris e quite substantially. Can you give an y sense, just in the con text of the Jap anese exam ple becau se that is where the focus of 10/5/99 14 attention is right now, how m uch of t he Japanese surplus is a consequence of the fact that their econom y has been going  nowhere for a decade? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON. I hesitate to attem pt to do the arithm etic on the spot. My guess is that we would probably say that 10 percen t is too large an  estim ate of  the output gap in Japan, in part because a w hole decad e of largely reduced capital accum ulation has had a bearing on the size of that gap. And with labor force gr owth essentially zero at this point, we see Japanese potential as radically d ifferent from  what it had been in prev ious decad es-- perh aps as  low as 1½ to 2 percen t or something like that. But let’s say for the sake of  argum ent that Japan could grow at 5 percent, the gap is 5 to 6 percent, and its rate of growth could rise steeply. It could be 2 or 3 years before they close the gap. Japan’s propensity to im port is not as  strong as that of some  other countries, and I think it is probably unit elastic on incom e. That would be my gue ss, so an increase in im ports could well o ccur. The dilemm a is that to th e extent Japan can close the output gap, that feeds through and no doubt has a positive effect on the U.S. economy. Indeed, our stronger export picture in this Greenbook does lead  to our net export contribution becom ing alm ost zero by the end of the forecast horizon. But for Japan, the greate r vigor that such a scenario--growing at 2 to 3 percent for three years, closing the gap, and then  growing at potential--would im part to the domestic econom y, would m ake Japan a m uch mo re attractive place for Japanese inv estors to invest than the United States. Thus, their investm ent in the Unite d States would slow. So even though there is a redu ced curren t account surplu s, each and every m onth Japan will h ave to m ake net inve stments in th e rest of the world. And that  will f ight th e tide, as it were, of  a Japan that seem s to be the place that is gaining cyclical vigor but whe re interest rate and exchange rate adjustm ents nonetheless m ake it look like a good idea for th em to invest abroad. So while it is true that these adjustm ents through th e incom e channel in som e sens e add to the capital account problem , there is a n eed for interes t rate and exch ange rate adjustm ents that attract m oney out of Japan despite its cyclical streng thening. How all that balances out will depend a great deal on risk prem iums, expectations, and invest or preferences. And we do not claim  that the num ber we’ve written down is in any sense the result of a truly an alytical calculation. We have tried to indicate what we think is the general direction and we put a magnitude in there that will show through. But the econom etric art of balancing thes e things and their effect on the exchange rate is in the Dark Ages som ewhere.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Speaking of prospects for Japan, wh at is th e current and p rospective s tate of play of policy in Japan these days , including their attitude toward intervention, either  unilateral or joint? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON. Of cou rse, that attracted m uch attention over th e weekend of the G-7 meeting and the preceding week and was a factor in some of the buffeting of the yen/dollar rate that occurred. At the m oment they apparently have no  plans for intervention. Just today, f or exam ple, a Japanese official--I’ve forgotten exactly which one--was quoted as saying that if the yen were to stabilize in the 105 to 106 yen/dol lar range, intervention would not be necessary. So that was the latest statem ent from  them. And th at’s perhap s indicative of the fact that their prop ensity to talk is higher than m ight see m constructive. We see fiscal policy coming through with a supplem ental budget large enough to yield the forecast that we have put in th e Greenbook. We have a view of when it will h appen and how m uch it will be, but that is designed to give us the fo recast that we have here. We believe Japanese authorities h ave comm itted certain ly to an additio nal supplement th is fall. And we believe th at they will have another next year, given the huge negative shock that  would occur were that not to happen. We think th at such a policy  will have s mooth sailin g. The Bank of Japan seem s to be considering so me alternative monetary  policy m easures in order to get reserves out into th e eco nomy more effectively than with their present p rocedures ; the latter leave a lot of exces s reserves in  the banks  and in these broker firm s called Danchi who just tend to s it on them . In their m ind that pra ctice is  futile. Ther e is no poin t in adding to  those reserves; they are not doing a nything. And the Bank of Japan has stated on several recent occasions th at it does no t want to do that. So th ey have sugg ested that th ey are con sidering som e alternatives that m ight be availabl e to them  should they decide they  need  to find a way to ease ev en further. They have discussed perhaps doing foreign exchange swaps, which would be to som e degree focused on the yen/dollar exchange rate. But those actions would be at  the discretion of the Bank of Japan and its policy board as opposed to a decision of the Ministry of Finance. In the last couple of days, they have been l eaving 1½ trillion yen in ex cess reserves in the system  instead of 1 trillion yen, which is som ething they said they would not do or did not see the 10/5/99 16 point of doing. And they have been explaining t hose on the grounds of seasonal factors relating to the end of the half fiscal year. So in principle they could leave in 1½ trillion instead of 1 trillion yen or m aybe decide to implem ent some of these addi tional tools. I think they  are at least trying to give the m arket the im pression th at there are oth er possibilities. They are stepping back a bit from the statem ent they m ade on Septem ber 21st that suggested there were no options and they were not thinking abo ut any optio ns. There will b e anot her meeting of  the policy b oard on October 13th. I don’t know that we will get a s tatem ent from  them that soon,  but we m ight get one in dicating that they are prepared to take certain actions if neede d. That’s w hat I would look for. At the m oment the m arket s eems to think that su ch a statem ent or  such a m odification in their policy course is a possibility. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Are there any further questions for either of our colleagues? If not, would som ebody like to start the gene ral discussion? President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Of course, the principal developm ent in our region since the last meeting was hurricane Floyd. It did som e damage in eastern S outh Carolina but, as I am sure you know from  the news reports, the brunt of the storm was borne by eastern North Carolina and the coast of Virginia. Apart from  the res ort areas on the Outer Banks, I would describe eastern North Carolina as a m oderately depressed, thinly populated, agricultural region. It contrasts very sharply with the central part of the state where so m uch is going on. So, while the farm ers and others who were hit directly by the storm  are really devastat ed in m any cases, at the end of the day I don’t think the overall im pact on the Dist rict’s economy is going to be that  great. And any impact at the nationa l level is like ly to be relativ ely sm all. I gather the s taff does have a sligh t increase in its housing starts forecast to  cover th e rebuildi ng, an d I think that is abou t right. Apart from  that situation , as far as th e Dist rict econom y as a whole is concerned, the story is basically the sam e old story I have been telling you all year. We don’t see any signs of a significant slackening in dem and in  our region. We do a m onthly su rvey of retail activity, and when we conducted th at survey in A ugust we detect ed a little deceleratio n in spendin g. But sales came back very strongly in Septem ber, so the Au gust report was probably noise. Dem and is strong essentially across the board, especial ly for automobiles bu t also f or furniture and other durables, for soft goods--you nam e it. All of our directors and other contacts who sell to consum ers, or know people who do, have stressed the extraordinary strength of household spending at this stage of the expansion. A lot of them refer to it as a househol d spending “binge,” and n early all doubt that it can be sustained. 10/5/99 17 Elsewhere, labor m arkets rem ain very tight in  our region. We continue to hear a lot of individual reports of sizable wa ge increases in certain m arkets,  though I wouldn’t say that is the general pattern. The bottom  line on the District is  that if you are not unde r water, you are probably doing pretty well, at least fo r now--and m aybe too well. In a broad w ay, as I read the Greenbook and liste ned to the staff’s comm ents this m orning, I think th at de scrip tion ap plies to the nationa l eco nomy as well. It seems clear at th is point th at econom ic activity in the third quarter was a lot st ronger than we thought it was going to be when we discussed it at our A ugust m eeting. All indi cations are that household and business spending were truly robust across the board in  the quarter. As we all know, a lot of that spending spilled over in to imports, and th at propensity seem s to have intensified recen tly. The curren t Greenbook projects that real net exports will reduce GDP in 1999 by 1¼ percentage points as opposed to 1 percentage point at the tim e of our August m eeting. Also, the exceptionally  strong dem and for cars and for computing and comm unications equipm ent has revived the m anufacturing sector very nicely. The level of industrial  production in August, I think it is worth pointing out, w as 1¼ percentage points above the second-quarter average. That’s about 4 or 5 pe rcent at an annual rate, and that is a lot! So th e growth of aggregate demand is con tinuing to outstrip the growth of potential G DP, it seem s to m e, further straini ng labor resources. According to the Greenbook, aggregate h ours worked  curren tly ex ceed the se cond-quarter average by cl ose to a percentage point--that is not annualized--and that  also is a lot. So for m e at least, it is very hard to see how these trends can continue. As I see it, a couple of things principally ha ve allowed the econom y to sustain this boom situation to this point w ithout any run-up in inflat ion. I doubt that this is news to any of you, but I think it is useful to point them  out. Clearly, it ’s basically two things. First, higher productivity growth has enabled firm s to pay the higher wages need ed to attract addition al workers in these very tight labor m arkets. If nom inal wage increases  at som e point begin to ex ceed the g rowth in productivity , I think we would have a problem . We would have a profit squeeze that would likely produce som e combination of higher inflation and declining stock prices. Second, imports, supported by capital inflows, have been a safety valv e as I see it, relieving so me of the pressure we otherwise w ould have experienced in  labor m arkets. That valve w ould tighten if net exports were to im prove, and we do have a projection of higher U.S. exports in the current Greenbook, given the signs of revival in Asia and Europe  and the weaker dollar.  I believe we need to keep a very close watch on both of these factors, which have b een supporting our noninflationary expansion. If 10/5/99 18 eithe r give s way, it seem s to m e that the expans ion will be thr eatened. And the per ception in som e quarters is that they are weakening;  I think that has been a f actor in the recent dec line of the stock perceptions were to build rapidly. And I don’t think we necessarily have a lot of tim e to react once a process like that gets under way. So, bottom  line, I think we need to be especially v igilan t at this stage and in my view we at leas t ought to consider seriously a fu rther pr eemptive actio n late r in the meeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an. In lin e with Al’s comm ents, I’d say the m ost significan t thing that has happened in  New E ngland recen tly had nothing to do with floods, thankfully, but with a golf ga me, the Ryder C up tournam ent. We’ve seen the im pact on the econom y of that, but certainly ther e was an im pact from  national a nd international press coverage-­not necessarily all favorable, I shou ld add, for the New England District. The District econom y overall continu es to expand  at a m oderate pace. In fact, th ere are a few straws in the wind that suggest  that growth is picking up and that wage and price pressures are as well. In particular, while m anufacturing jobs continue to decline on a year-ov er-year basis, the Second-quarter figures show a rebound in exports, part icularly to Singapore a nd the crisis areas of Asia and to Mexico. So this one  rather weak part of the New E ngland econom y is starting to look brighter again. Indeed, anecdotes from our Beigebook contacts suggest that m any m anufacturers believe that the worst is over in term s of their tr ade with Asia and that the future bodes quite well. Labor m arkets in the region rem ain extrem ely tight and even m anufacturing firm s report difficulty in hiring and retaining production workers, a trend that is likely only to get worse as regional exports grow. The regional unem ployment ra te hit 3 percent in A ugust, which equals its low for the expansion and is th e lowest rate since 1988. Beige book contacts in every industry reported sho rtages of  workers a t all skill leve ls, from technica l to produ ction to of fice and secretarial w orkers. Temporary em ploym ent firm s contacted in Septem ber reported a continuation and deepening of earlier trends: solid growth in their business revenues, w ith a poten tial for much greater returns if an additional supply of labor could possibly be found. Temporary help firm s are actually recruiting. Some are us ing signing bonuses but m ost are trying to tap new sources of workers such as retirees, the otherwise unem ployed --including for mer welfare recipients--and even 10/5/99 19 refugee populations. We also hear from  temporary firm s that they are doing som e retraining of workers them selves. The tourism  industry has been particularly ha rd hit by labor shortage s. Members of the Bank’s sm all business New England Advisory Counc il reported that restaura nts and other tourist-related businesses in southern Ma ine were forced to close a coupl e of days during the week over this pas t summer because there jus t was not suffic ient staff to keep them  open. This situation becam e increasing ly difficult in late August when colleg e students left for school. Looking at the other seasonal industry, the ski resorts, one ski area owner repor ted that he paid the summer medical insu rance p remiums for key seasonal wo rkers and th eir families in order to en sure tha t the workers will return this winter. Given the tightness in labor m arkets, the continued comm entary in the Beigebook of moderate w age increases in the range of 3 to 5 pe rcent rem ains a bit of a puzzle. Indeed, we are seeing som e increase in m anufactur ing wages in the aggregate regional  data and an in creas e in th e rate of grow th in the Boston CPI. In additi on, m anufacturing contacts re port that input price increases are now m ore prevalent th an decreases , whic h is a shif t from earlier reports. There is also a concern ab out accelerating costs for health insurance. Busin esses in the region app ear to be fighting to retain control of co sts and  are linking com pensation to revenues as m uch as possible. While it is h ard to se e it yet in the ag gregate data or to reconcile it with the reports of moderate wage increases, one gets the sense that they m ay be slowly in the process of losing that battle on both the wage and the raw m aterial sides. One area of the region where the battle clearly has been lost is real estate, both residential and commercial.  The Boston office m arket is red hot, with very low vacancy  rates and ris ing ren t prices. It is not likely to get much  better even with new construction  since the vast m ajority o f new space under construction is already leased.  Beyond Boston, the suburban office m arkets ar e vibrant as well. Even the l ong depressed city of Hartford is stag ing a com eback, with lower v acancy rates  and rising prices. Finally, th e prices of residential real esta te continue to clim b at a faster rate th an for the nation  as a whole. Turning to the nation, w e have no major disagr eements with the Greenbook forecast. It is quite sim ilar in shape to our own. Incom ing data  on the real dom estic econom y are considerably stronger than we and others had expected earlier in the year, and we see considerable mom entum through the last part of this year and into 2000. Foreign grow th is surpassing expectations, and rising exports are bringing m anufacturing back to life after the Asian problem . Indeed, it would seem  that all the tem porary factors th at acted to restrain price incre ases in  the f ace of  extrem ely 10/5/99 20 tight labor m arkets and above-trend growth--dec lining commodity prices, excess world capacity, the strong d ollar, declining h ealth b enefit costs--are now slip ping away. Will increas ed productivity growth save the day?  Can we real ly count on stabilization or  decline in the stock count on productivity growth and stoc k market restraint, that really only puts us in line for what looks like a considerable upturn in prices next year, if one believ es the Greenbook forecast. Should one believe the Greenbo ok forecast? Is this forecast of increasing price pr essures m ore believable now than it was earlier this year, or  a year ago, or even two years ag o? My own view is that it is more believable because of the waning effects of the beneficial tem porary factors and the beginnings of pipeline inflation th at Mike Prell referred to in hi s comm ents. Moreover, we are clearly runn ing the risk that the v ery strong rates of near-term growth could exacerb ate rather than damp the i mbalances reflected in unrealistic a sset prices and in high and growing levels of consum er and business debt.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, the Twelfth Distri ct’s expansion has gained m omentum since early in the year. Following m oderate growth in the first quarte r, job growth picked up to a 2.8 percen t rate during th e second quarter and th at pace was m aintained in Ju ly and August. Econom ic activity has been expanding m ore qui ckly in Calif ornia than in  the res t of the Distr ict. This has helped California attract jobs a nd residents from  other states and has spurred substantial gains in construction activity. Nonetheless,  conditions outside of California  have rem ained robust. For exam ple, Nevada’s econ omy has picked up steam recently with gam ing revenues g rowing at their fastest pace since 1994. Rapid job growth has tightened District labor m arkets. After rem aining roughly constant in 1998, the District unem ploym ent rate has fallen by ½ pe rcentage point so far th is year. This is due to im proved conditions in California where the August unemploym ent rate of 5.1 percent was the lowest recorded since 1969. Although the unem ploym ent rate rem ains higher in the T welfth District than in the rest of the nation, labor com pensation costs have  risen more rapidly in the W est, with a strong upward trend evident over the p ast several years. Moreover, tight labor m arkets have prom pted employers to find alternative m ethods for attracting and retaining workers. These methods include the provision of on-site benefits th at conserve workers’ tim e and enable them  to spend m ore hours on the job. 10/5/99 21 Despite strength in the econom y as a  whole,  the District’s high-tech and aerospace manufacturers face sign ificant challenges. California’s m akers of se miconductors hav e begun expanding again, but em ploym ent in that industry re mains below its peak of early last year. Manufacturers of com puter equipm ent throughout the Dist rict have continued to shed jobs in recent months, with m akers of disk driv es being especia lly hard hit. Moreover,  the recen t earthquake in Taiwan interrupted that country’s extensive semiconductor and com puter equipm ent production and that has clouded the outlook for prices and the availability of computer com ponents in the fall and winter. In the aerospace sect or, Boeing is well on its way to its  target of 53,000 job cuts by the end of 2000, having eliminated about 35,000 since early last year. Most of these cuts have been in Washington State, bu t the rate of red uction p icked up recen tly in Southern California where Boein g is phasing out several m odels of aircraft that it inherited from  McDonnell Douglas. In contrast to the com puter hardware and aer ospace sectors, com puter software and service providers have been expanding em ploym ent and out put at a torrid pace. That has caused total employm ent growth in the Seattle ar ea actually to pick up in spite of the cuts at Boeing. It also has kept Silicon Valley’s econom y hea lthy despite job  losses in th e hardware sector. As a result, housing prices in Silicon Valley rose about 15 percent during the 12 m onths ending in July. Turning to the national econom y, the  data m ade available since we m et in August certainly suggest that the supply shock of recent years has not yet run its course. Based on recent m onthly data, we have revised up our estim ate of third- quarter real GDP growth from 3½ to 4½ percent, similar to the projection in the Greenbook. This ha s com bined with favorable news on the core CPI in August, which broug ht the m ost recent 12 -month in crease to just un der 2 percen t. This apparent supply shock m akes forecasting esp ecially treacher ous, but our best estim ate continues to show a modest slowdown in the rate of real GDP growth next  year. Under the assum ption of no further change in the federal funds rate, we now proj ect a 3 percent increase in real GDP in 2000 as domestic dem and slows in response to the recent tightening of m onetary policy, com bined with an assum ed flattening of the stock m arket’s trajecto ry. Growth at this pace would leav e lab or markets tight next year and continue to indicate upwar d price pressures. We are showing a 2½ percent increase in the core CPI next year  despite a slowing of GDP growth to jus t below trend . And with labor m arkets projected to be tight through the end of 2000, more upward price pressures would be forthcom ing in 2001. Obviously, there are a num ber of i mportant risk s to this outlook. First, the m odest drop in the dollar and a pickup in foreign growth could add significantly to inflati onary pressures if they 10/5/99 22 were to gain  momentum . Second, th e recen t modest drop in equity p rices rem inds us that the econom y rem ains vulnerable to a much larger st ock m arket correction from  today’s very high levels. And finally, there is sim ply no way to determ ine the s ize or p ersistence of the current supply shock. A review of forecast errors in recent  years ind icates that th is shock has consistently surprised us on the positive side. Although we don’t know how long the s upply shock will last, I don’t th ink there is reaso n to believe it has ende d yet. Its continuation, su pported by recent data, reduces the chance of an  inflation p roblem  in the foreseeable future. Thank you.

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Although the overall pace of growth in the Southeastern region appears to ha ve moderated, our economy still se ems to be on a path that is slightly above that of the nation as a whole. Our im portant and thriving Florida tourism  industry dodged the Hurricane Floyd bulle t with only a modest tem porary im pact, including the closing of Disney W orld for the first tim e in its 28-year history. Perhaps I should p ublicly apologize to m y friends in N orth Caro lina for wishin g the sto rm would go som ewhere else and having it end up there.

MR. BROADDUS. I’ll pass your apology along!

MR. GUYNN. Our energy sector finally seem s to be responding to the higher oil prices with som e pickup in oil and natural gas drilling, but the increased rig count has not yet had m uch trickle-down effect on the boat-building and other support businesses. Our cont acts in that industry still say, ho wever, tha t the m ajor players in the business are giving higher prior ity to dr illing in other parts of the world and are som ewhat distracted by their m ergers. The m oderation in our region is com ing from  a couple of places. Single-fam ily residential home building and sales have slowed m easurably in  all of our areas except  Florida. Manufacturing activity is a m ixed bag. A regional survey of m anufacturers in August showed som e slowdown in both curr ent activ ity and in the ou tlook. This is r eflected in our port activity, which is still very unbalanced, with im ports continuing to flood in wh ile exports have been slow to respond. One m ore tim e: Labor m arkets remain very tight . Some say they are even a bit tighter than earlier in the  year. Unus ually large wage incre ases still see m prim arily conf ined to servic es at this point. As has already been comm ented on by a couple of others, reports of large health insurance cost increases have becom e more prevalent, and people in that indus try say, “Get used to it.” One of my Rotary Club colleagues told me yesterday at lunch that if we  are waiting to find the flow-through effect from  higher oil prices , he clearly sees it in the adde d cost of his asphalt business. 10/5/99 23 Our staff m embers who talk to con tacts jus t before each FOMC m eeting were struck b y, and remarked on, the noticeable lack of comm ents this tim e around about competition holding down price increas es. That had  becom e a very pred ictable m essage. And it gives m e som e pause to think that these co mpetitiv e pressures, p erhaps attribu table now to rising p rices for som e competitiv e imports, m ay be abating and fueling the hope for som e long postponed price increases. On the national level, as others have alrea dy observed, m ost of the current data surprises have once again been on the upsid e, and the overall strength of th e econo my has been m uch greater than I expected at the tim e of our last m eeting. The Greenbook does a good job of highlighting where that strength is com ing from . I found m yself during most of the interm eeting period getting m ore comfortable with the notion that large productivity gains are very likely still ahead of us . In the absence of com pelling data to m ake that case, w e have pressed our 44 District directors for two months now for their sense of where those productivity gains are comi ng from  and what is ahead. Almost without exception we are told that we m ay have seen only the tip of the iceberg in term s of the long-term potential of inexpensive com puters and comm unications technology. We have been given exam ples of the opportunities that  are still ahead for all kinds of  businesses, large and sm all. Having said publicly that I was skeptical that we  could fully count on the continuation of recent large p roductivity gain s, I am  getting more comfor table that higher productivity and, th erefore, a higher rate of econom ic growth m ay be more sustainable than we thought. I also began to take som e comfort in the unf olding inventory story. Here again, we have turned to our District directors for som e business insights into what  is really going on. Interestingly, the overwhelm ing consensus is  that the recent inve ntory rundown is likely perm anent. The reasons given are heavily depend ent on the spread of te chnological advances in communications and the broad use of m ore sophis ticated analytical approaches to inventory manage ment. Equally interesting was the fact that m ost of the people we have been talking to about this feel that the process is not nearly com plete. These in sights suggest to m e that we m ay not get large additional stim ulus in the period ah ead from  inventory building and that we m ay be less burdened with an inventory overhang fo llowing any correction in the f uture. These com forting insights into  productivity and inventory m anagem ent, taken along with the direct an d signal effects of our tw o recen t tigh tening m oves, were giving m e the sense that we might have som e breathing room  with policy fo r the m oment. However, the FOMC meeting preparation period this tim e has rekindled m y une asiness abou t what m ay lie ahead. I do not like 10/5/99 24 the run-up in inflation f orecast in th e Greenboo k. I do not like the sam e run- up in in flation forecast in my own staff’s analytical work, including th e signals of higher inflation given by our VAR model--even  adjusted for the extraord inary en ergy price increases. And these forecasts based on the ana lytica l work are n ot incons istent with th e unfolding story of continued strength in so m any sectors of the econom y. We see continued str ong job and incom e growth, continued strong consum er and investm ent spending, persistent  strength in housing, an im proving outlook for exports, prospects for higher-than-expected gove rnment spending, and indications of price pressures in som e recent data and an ecdotal reports. Monetary  policy m ay still be too accomm odative, so we h ave a m ore difficult, m ore interestin g, and m ore im portant policy discussion ahead this m orning than I thought like ly just a couple of weeks ago. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

MR. BOEHNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The regional econom y for the Philadelphia District continues to operate at high levels, with tight labor markets and benign inflation. Consum ers are spend ing freely. The m arket for ho mes is rob ust. Recent increases in mortgage rates have caused m ore hom ebuyers sim ply to shift to variable rate m ortgages. Comm ercial real estate is also  very ac tive, with low va cancy ra tes for office buildings. Some uptick in rents is occurring, although given the am ount of new building there is a consensus that the increases m ay be short-lived. Manufacturers re port moderate growth, capacity a ppears adequate to handle the increase in dem and, and output pric es are stable. The labor m arket is especially tight for m iddle and lower level workers and m ixed for professional people. For exam ple, bank tellers are in short supply but senior level banking peop le are available. Accountants are in short supply but lawyers are in am ple supply. [Laughter]

MR. BOEHNE. The stress in the health care industry is becom ing widespread. Hospitals and m edical schools are increasingly squeezed fin ancially. Physicians are more am enable to unionization or dropping out of governm ent insurance program s. Patients are turning to politicians more and more to seek relief from  the “deny and delay” tactics of insure rs. The frustrations associated w ith non-price rationing techniques are becom ing more acu te. The Philadelphia area is disproportionately dependent on the health care industry, and the fallout  from  health care stresses is clearly negative for the regional econom y. 10/5/99 25 Turning to the national econom y, inc oming inform ation points to a strong second half with labor m arkets becom ing even m ore stretched. Yet inflation rem ains ta me. The longer this favorable combination lasts, the m ore I consider faster productivity growth to be a m ore im portant factor holding inflationary pressure s down than the assortm ent of te mporary factors. Nonetheless, there still is a large elem ent of  uncertainty about the outlook f or productivity. This kind of uncertainty can be resolved only with tim e, tempered by policy actions motivated by an ongoing assessm ent of where the balance of risks lies. Against a background of c ontinuing benign inflation, two recen t increas es in the federal fu nds rate, and more edgin ess in financial m arkets, my assessm ent is that the ris ks are sufficiently balan ced to warrant a wait-and-see approach to policy for now.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Seventh District econom y, with the notable exception of the agricu ltural sector, rem ains on a m oderate growth path with activ ity in most sectors at very high levels . A key driving force continues to  be the strength in dem and for autom obiles and light trucks. Sales of light vehicles  again w ere quite robust in September, as Mike Prell m entioned, and autom akers have raised thei r sales forecasts for next year. Similarly, m any small and medium  sized m anufacturing firm s surveyed by our directo rs are forecastin g good econom ic perform ance in their sectors for as fa r as two to three year s ahead. Producers of consum er durables, such as appliances and lawn and garden equipm ent, are benefiting from  a relatively strong regional housing m arket. The Dist rict’s share of dom estic steel production has increased s ignificantly in recen t months and solid pe rform ance continues  to be repo rted by contac ts in the printing and publishing industry. Some producers of heavy-duty trucks, paper and packaging, f ood equipment, and som e housing co nstruction m aterials repo rted a recen t moderation in activity, b ut none voiced concern b ecause activ ity has rem ained at v ery high levels. For exam ple, orders for heavy-duty trucks are sti ll considered to be good, although they have com e down recently in part because or der books are being cleared out, wh ich is the norm al practice at this tim e of the year. The agricultural sector rem ains weak, though th ere has been som e slight im prove ment from what I reported at our last m eeting. Over the past few weeks I have m et with m embers from  the Illinois Farm Bureau as well as our own Agricu lture Advisory Council. Council m embers noted that dairy farm ers are benefiting from low f eed costs resulting from  unbelievably good hay production and a good corn crop. Mem bers also reported that they were pleased with corn yields 10/5/99 26 except in In diana where dry summ er weather lim ited yields. Of course, with  the low grain prices, grain farm ers are still under a gr eat deal of pressure. Moreov er, egg, poultry, and hog prices are below the co st of production, which will lead to ad justm ents over the n ext 12 to 18 months that will result in red uced supplies and higher prices. In addition, farm equipm ent m anufacturers have announced further production cuts th at will result in layoffs. Labor m arkets rem ain tight, with scattered re ports of shortages for entry-level workers, truck dr ivers, farm labor ers, cons truction work ers, and som e managem ent position s. However, contacts generally indicate that wage gains rem ain in the same range seen over the past two years or so; that is in contrast to the national data on average hourl y earnings and em ploym ent costs, which show som e moderation. The labor contract negotiations in the auto mobile industry have proceeded rather sm oothly so far. My contacts  at the m ajor autom akers describ e the term s of the Daim ler-Chrysler and the GM contracts as definitely  more expensive than last tim e. Wage gains are 3 percent per year plus a cost of living a llowance, and signing bonuses and pensions were improved. The new contracts place som e restricti ons on outsourcing, but they are not as severe as reported in the press. Autom akers are required to  send a letter to suppliers  requesting them  to be neutral on unionizing efforts, but th e letter is not expect ed to have any significant effect. The new contracts are for four years rather than three y ears. Nonetheless, neither  the autom akers nor the United Automobile W orkers expect the contracts to set a pattern for suppliers or for labor negotiations in other industries. In term s of price developm ents, there are som e concerns about the future but so far a pickup in the underlying inflation rate is  not evident. Several m anufact urers noted that higher energy prices we re likely to ra ise their inpu t costs in the future. Sharp increases in health insu rance co sts, especially for prescriptions, were also noted. I had an interesting conve rsation with a national specialty retailer who has stores all over the country. He noted that higher construction costs are significantly increasingly his occupa ncy costs and resulting in 1 to 2 percent increases in his overall operating costs for new stores as co mpared with e xisting sto res. For the most part, however, firm s continue to have little prici ng power and seek to lower costs through various m eans or increased labor productivity, or both. As one of the m embers of our Small Businesses Advisory Council put it, “W e continue to look for m ore efficiencies since no one is inte rested in paying us more m oney just because our health insurance premium rose 21 percen t recently. ” Turning to the national econom y, our  outlook is quite sim ilar to that in the Greenbook. The strength of dom estic dem and has been very im pressive since our last m eeting. The third quarter 10/5/99 27 appears to have been rem arkably strong and some of the m omentum  should carry forward. The slowing in dom estic dem and that we continue to expect seems no closer n ow than at o ur las t meeting. Moreover, while there clearly are downs ide risks, foreign dem and continues to pick up and we are losing that safety valve. Given those trends, the labor m arket could tighten even a bit more, raisin g the risk of accelera ting inflation. Of course, we’ve been forecasting an acceleration of inflation for a while and core inflation has continued to edge down. But, clearly, som e of the factors that have contributed to th at decline have turned around--the value of the dollar, the price of oil and o ther commoditie s, and health  insuranc e premiums. One can now even point to at le ast some evidence of pipeline inflationary pressures in the PPI data. So, even with the policy actions we have taken to date, in m y judgment the risks still seem  to be  tilted to the upside.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Hoenig.

MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Tenth District’s economy continues to operate at a relatively high leve l of activity. Our year-over-y ear em ployment growth was 1.3 percen t, and  that is from  already high levels of labor participation and em ploym ent. Retailers have reported that sales are flat but at high levels, and they expect to continue to experience good levels of activity. Despite the slowing in employm ent growth in som e areas, construction rem ains our fastest grow ing sector in the District. Energy activity in the D istrict has turned around significantly--60 percent above th e level in March--although it is still slightly below year-ago levels in term s of e mploym ent. In manufacturing, few jobs have been added but that is due in part to cutbacks by Boeing in Missouri and Kansas. Taking that into account, e xports of m anufactured goods out of the District are estim ated to be at pre-crisis levels. So there has been a very strong recovery in that area. The District’s unem ploym ent rate edged dow n to about 3.4 percent in August and we continue to have tight labor m arkets. We hear an  increasing n umber of anecdotal reports of wage pressures, especially in our m etropolitan areas su ch as Denver and Kansas City. Consum er prices have shown very m odest increases, although on th e input side prices of  som e manufac turing and construction m aterials have edged up or have in creased significantly, depending on the particular type of input one is speaking about. The farm  econom y, of c ourse, is the area that  remains weak. But governm ent paym ents are keeping farm incom es and finances at good leve ls and recent legislation m ay put far m support paym ents at or near the record levels that we  saw in the 1980s. Overa ll, though, the District is doing very well. 10/5/99 28 At the national level, I have no m ajor disa greem ents with the Greenbook. I understand and recognize th at forecastin g is a risky b usiness in an d of itself. I think it is im portant, th en, to look at the circum stances we face at this time. Demand is very strong--som e would suggest excessive-­with GDP growth well above 3 percent when, in  thinking about labor growth and productivity, potential m ay be in the 3 percent range. In many ways we are comfortable with that because inflation rem ains m odest and productiv ity ga ins continue. But it is im portant to look at som e of the other factors that are in play. The strong dem and is being accomm odate d importantly by a trade deficit and a current account deficit that are at record levels. Personal saving rates are estim ated to be in the negative range, labor co sts are rising, and labor dem and re mains very strong. When we talk to business people about wage  pressures, they give som e indication that they ’re paying “above norm al” to r etain work ers. But the d efinition of “norm al” is moving higher. So we’re continually seeing an in creas e in th e so-called no rmal rate that gives m e som e pause. When I look at the dem and in the econom y in term s of both the consum er and corporate sectors, consum er debt is rising to  record levels and corporate debt is increasing. I think we have to take that into account. Margin cr edit is rising to record levels as well. The question for us, of course, is whether m onetary po licy is accomm odati ng this debt increase. We’ve had two recent funds rate increases and that is worth noting. But at the sam e time, the growth rates in the monetary aggregates rem ain at or above our project ed targets. I think that has to be taken into account as well as we look at all these other factors. So, I believe our policy involves som e continued upside risk for inflation and we shoul d be m indful  of that as we enter the policy discussion phase of the m eeting.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. To convey the story of  our District it is often tem pting to say, “It’s m otor vehicles.” If motor vehicles ar e boom ing, the econom y is boom ing. And as you all know, m otor vehicles are boom ing. Like Mike Mo skow, I was hearing reports from directors, especially those from  steel com panies, on how they characterized th e auto  contracts. They were talking about them  as being generous or even ex travagant. But unlike th e views Mike encountered, they were claim ing that the auto contracts were pattern-setting, and they are concerned about the effects. The AFL-CIO is putting ou t som e talking points for the press ab out how generous this package was. That has been disturbing to sm all business ow ners because their em ployees see that. Besides, they live next door to som e of th e autoworkers benefiting from  those contracts. 10/5/99 29 One very large com pany headquartered in th e District that supplies the m otor vehicle industry and housing m arkets worldwide had what  I considered a very strong report about increasing export dem and com bined with reduced im port competition. It means that they have th e best opportunity for raising prices they have seen in years. The instruction has gone out throughout the organ ization th at they are to wor k to ra ise prices at any and every opportunity. They do see their own ra w materials prices ris ing, but they also feel that they’re  going to be able to pass those increases along. Labor cost pressures continue to intensify. We hear the sam e kinds of  stories about benefit costs increasing at double-digit rate s that everybody has b een talking about. The general sense is that, as far as health care costs are concerned, it has been bad in 1999 and it will be worse next year. People m ention severe shortages of nurses, ai des, and other health care  workers. Those in the health care industry talk about the pa ckages they have to pay to attrac t people or to retain workers. One executive at a sm all m anufacturing com pany said  it got hit hard by the increase in  its he alth care costs--he used the sam e 21 percent figure that you did, Mike-- and expects the increase in the next year to be higher if anything. As an indication of what’s going on in cons truction, a comment was m ade that the dem and has been so strong that union cont ractors are now subcontracting to nonunion firm s just to try to get the work done. One small businessm an in the m id-Ohio area, a supplier of luxury consum er goods --swimm ing pools, hot tubs, patio fu rniture, and the like--said they had a very strong June. They saw a leveling off at what they c onsidered to be a very high level in July and August, but then in products they sell, to see Septem ber com e in so strong. Another com pany that supplies the truck ing ind ustry sa id that it is exp ecting to f inish out this year with about an 8 percent increase in sales and is budgeting for an increase next ye ar in the 10 to 15 percent range. As we’ve done before at this tim e of year, we  took a look at what has been going on in the race ho rse auction bus iness. At Keeneland th is year gros s sales for September were u p 37 percen t and at $253 m illion reached an all-tim e record for any thorou ghbred sale anywhere in  the world. The average price was u p 30 percen t and the nu mber  of horses sold was up 5 percent. The prior record for th e num ber of horses so ld at $1m illion or more was 17. This year they so ld 23, with one horse going at $3.9 m illion--the h ighest ever reco rded. I wanted to probe a little deeper, beyond th e issue of prices, to find out where the buyers were com ing from. Were they all people from Microsoft or W all Street?  I was to ld that after a slum p last year , there w as a rebound in Japanese 10/5/99 30 purchases. Also evident was a return of de mand out  of the Middle East. In total, wh ere th e sourc e could be id entified, foreigners spen t $52 m illion in the Sep tember sales this year v ersus $32 m illion last year, for a large gain. Some of the issues that cam e up in our Advi sory Council m eetings caused us to look into Y2K planning in a different way than we had before. Com panies, both banks and others, were saying that they didn’t expect to have cash aroun d for their own operations or to m eet em ployees’ needs for cash. They plan to se nd their em ployees to check cashing facilities. So we decided to contact the check cashing facilities and found none that is planning to  add to its currency holdings. They don’t view that as being the business they are in and they don’t expect to do so. One sim ply said, “If we run out of cash, we’ ll just close the door for a few da ys.” Another Y2K-related item that cam e from an Advisory Council m ember who is in the warehousing business caught our attention. He said that P roctor and Gam ble has been m oving through th e area taking up additional warehouse space becau se it wants to accum ulate severa l months of extra inventory by the tim e we get to December. Let m e report one m ore exam ple, in a som ewhat different area, where the idea th at there’s no pricing power is becom ing an increasingly quain t notion. We looked at tuition increases at public and private universities, and th ey are qu ite sharp. All o f the public univers ities in Ohio tha t we contacted said that their tuition charges were up by 4 percent or m ore. The big three-­University of Akron, Ohio State, and Ohio University--were all up 6 percen t. They said they would have done m ore but several years ago th e state legislatu re imposed a m aximum tuition increase of 6 percent in one year, so they’ll just  have to raise tuition pr ices again next year. Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh ra ised the tuition f or entering f reshmen by 11.3 percent and that for returning sophom ores, juniors, and seniors by 3.5 percent. On the natio nal econom y, it’s n ice to have a Greenbook forecast that final dem and, or nominal spending, will d ecelerate so mewhat next y ear and th e year beyon d. But we’ve had that forecast bef ore and th ere is jus t noth ing in th e numbers to sug gest th at that is going to happen. Growth in nom inal spending this ye ar is not jus t a lot abov e the rate forecast a year ago, it has doubled. That may have been because of the pessim ism com ing from  Asia. But even if we go back six m onths, it’s m uch stronger than what was expected then. Again we have a forecast that the expansion is going to slow down. But that is just a foreca st and I can’t see anything in the recen t data that supports it. There certain ly is no thing in any of the m onetary statistics or the credit 10/5/99 31 statistics we’re seeing. So I’m  very skeptical that we’ve already calibrated policy to insure that nominal dem and slows to a rate con sistent with nonaccelerating inflation .

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Econom ic growth in the Eleventh  District continues to expand at a brisk pace. Employment gro wth in recen t months has been runnin g over 3 percent, well ab ove the national average. The improved condition of our tr ading partners, especially Mexico, has been an important factor. The purchasing power of the Me xican peso is up by more than 10 percent since the beginning of the year. And other leading indicators of future Mexican econom ic activity, especially real oil prices a nd inventories, suggest that th e expansion will continue. Rising oil prices are beginning to provide a sli ght boost to the District econom y. However, I need to emphasize that the Texas econom y was growing strongly in late 1998 and early 1999, when oil prices were ho vering aroun d $12 a barrel a nd were anticipated to fall still fu rther. Texas is only about one-fourth as sensitiv e to changing energy prices as it was a little m ore than a decade ago. Rising oil prices have tri ggered a m odest increase in drill ing activity, although m ost industry insiders continue to believe, along with the fu tures m arket, that toda y’s high prices are not sustainable. The Texas rig count has increased 43 percen t since June but w ould need to increase another 45 percent to reach the level that prevailed the last tim e prices were above $20 a barrel. Most other sectors of the regional econom y are doing well. Constructio n activ ity re mains steady and retailers report good sales growth. The growth in dem and for both com puters and semiconductors has been stronger th an anticipated a few m onths ago. The wage data in our region continue to a ppear benign, while the anecdotal inform ation signals some upward pressure on labor costs. Some firms are hir ing workers with f ewer skills th an usual. One contact reported that “the unem ployable are now being em ployed.” The rising tide appears to be raising m ore boats. We see this dram atically along the Texas-Mexico border where unem ployment ra tes hav e fallen to single-d igit le vels in thre e of the f our m ajor m etro areas that typically experience unemploym ent rates above 12 percent. The pull of a strong labor m arket in other parts of Texas and elsewhere in the Un ited States has been working wonders on boosting econom ic opportunity for those at the bottom . We must not forget that this has taken place in recen t years against the b ackdr op of declin ing inflation. Turning to the national econom y, I’m looking fo r growth over the forecast horizon to remain in the 3½ percent range that we’ve experi enced so far this year. This m ay be on the optim istic side given the condition of financial m arkets. Most m ajor stock m arket indexes have 10/5/99 32 fallen by ab out 10 percent since our last m eeting and there has been a noticeable p ickup in yield spreads, both of which should restrain spending behavior by households and businesses. Perhaps our growing current account deficit is already acti ng to restrain future capital inflows, thereby reinforcing the tightened stance of  monetary policy. I’m not fore seeing any significant pickup in inflation in the next year or so. Most broad m easures of inflation, including the core CPI, the PCE deflator, and the GDP deflator, are running below  2 percent. The core PPI for finished goods has pressure. Comm odity prices other than oil have st abilized or risen only sli ghtly from their lows. Indeed, it is surprising h ow little th e uptick in commodity prices has been , given the p ickup in demand from Asia and Europe combined with the need to b uild inv entories to dea l with Y2K concerns. To me this suggests a continued re lative absence o f inflation in  the pipe line.

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The m ajor trends in the District econom y rem ain intact, which is to say that outside of the agricu ltural sector the District econom y is very healthy. Consum er spending is strong; auto sales are part icularly strong. My cas ual observation, for what it’s worth, is that one of the things going on in the autom obile area is tha t an increasing num ber of households now have more cars than drivers. There seem s to be specialization; people are buying cars for particular purposes. Some of that m ight be weather-related in our  District; nev ertheless, that’s clearly occurring. Housing activity is also strong. Home prices in the Twin Cities m etropolitan area have been rising significantly and hom e improvem ent activ ity is robust. I suspect it’s lim ited only by the availability of contractors because in a ny neighborhood I drive throu gh I see evidence that people are improving their hom es by re modeling or adding to them . Employm ent growth in the Dist rict has slowed. I think th at’s basically because we’re running out of workers. Apropos that, the unem ploym ent rate in the Tw in Cities m etro area has dropped below 2 percent again, and there is a m id-sized city or two wher e the unem ploym ent rates are even lower than that. The onl y other thing I would pass on about th e District is th at I expect to see som e deterioration in credit quality at the banks, which is partly related to agriculture, of course. But beyond that, in talking to bankers it  seem s to m e that they  are still chasing the My view of the national econom y is sim ilar to my  view of the District  in the sense that I think th e trends that h ave been in p lace for so me time will co ntinue. It seemed likely that the 10/5/99 33 second-quarter slowdown in growth wa s an aberration and that turns out to be right. Inflation has remained modest. As we all know, if we take a step  back and think about the last several years, the national econom y has perform ed remarkably well. We’ve had rapid growth and m odest inflation, which is quite cons isten t with what o ur VAR m odel was forecasting over that  period of tim e. If this keeps up, I’m  going to have to develop som e confidence in that m odel! I would note that the model continues to forecast essent ially m ore of the sam e. But I think the Greenbook raises the right qu estio n: Is inflation going to accelerate from  here? Several people have comm ented, and I agree, that it depends a lot on how productivity perf orms in the future. I’m relatively optim istic about that, but I’ll reserve the rest  of my comm ents until later.

There’s usually  a silen ce and then som ebody will talk about the pressures in the labor m arket. Of course, that’s not really new. So what I’m  hearing is just a broken record. When I press peop le about the labor m arket, they  say it’s awfully hard to find workers, but they are finding them . At the end of  the day they’re hiring people, though they have to strugg le to do so. They get peop le who a pply for receptio nist job s who have body piercing in any num ber of places. [Laughter] They wonder how these people have th e nerve to walk in, bu t they do. Apparently the em ployers end up coachi ng them  or whatever and put them  in those position s. So, those ar e the kinds of  stories we he ar. Essentia lly th ere is n othing new except a f ew amusing anecdotes along the way. My contacts at UPS and FedEx confirm  the strong  recovery in U.S. exports, particularly to Asia. They em phasize especially that the resurg ence in activ ity in Korea a nd Japan is very clear though Malaysia and the Philipp ines still have p roblem s. They say that they just can’t get enough capacity out of Hong Kong--t hat the m arket is very  strong there. Exports to Latin America are fairly f lat; I get the im pression f rom my contacts that nothing much is going on there. In term s of export volum e, UPS at the begi nning of this year was anticipating an increase of At this point UP S is projecting volum e in the year 2000 to be over this year. So, UPS is anticipating in U.S. exports to those m arkets. I continue to hear stories about the difficulti es of keeping staff levels up but, again, UPS and FedEx are finding ways to do it. On the Y2K i ssue, UPS is expecting som e surge in both U.S. exports and im ports--som e shift of s hipm ents that would have occurred in January into Decem ber 10/5/99 34 for precautionary purpo ses. I think all of the thi ngs we’re hearing along those lin es make sense. The FedEx picture is very m uch the sam e, so I won’t say anything specific about that. On the natio nal pic ture, I think we ca n reasonab ly forecast tha t we will ha ve an upward creep in pressures on inflation and an upward creep in the possibilit ies for productivity growth. It is som ewhat of a race as to wher e tho se two will c ome out. I must say tha t I would be a lot happ ier if money growth were com ing down during this peri od of rising interest rates. Obviously, with rising interest rates, we’d generally say that, o ther things equ al, there would be less money demanded. Yet m oney s upply growth is continuing above the growth of nom inal spending, or at least what is a reasonable track for nom inal spen ding. So I am certainly concerned about that. On the inflation outlook, besides the “creepi ng” part, whether it does creep up really depends critically on expectations. And as long as expectations re main very, very solid, as they are, I think we’re not going to be faced with a ny sudden outbreak. On the other hand, we play the critical role in keeping those expectations where they are. Thank you.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Second District’s econom y appears to b e expanding at a rath er steady pace despite intensifying price pressures in th e manufacturing and construction sectors. Consum er price inflation apparently rem ains in check. Private sector em ployment grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate in A ugust, down from  July’s robust 3.2 percen t pace but m atching the second-quarter pace.  Retailers report th at sales pick ed up in early September following a sluggish perform ance in August. They also note that there was a good deal less discounting in the third quarter than a year earlier. Tropical storm Floyd caused som e flooding and utility disruptions in New Jersey and m ay have affected retail sales in m id-Septem ber. However, its overall effect on the regional economy appears to have been modest. The housing m arket rem ains strong, though ne w construction is being hampered by widespread supply shortages and bottlenecks. Singl e-fam ily housing perm its have picked up in the most recen t quarter and double-d igit increases in  hom e prices ar e reported  in New Jersey and Manhattan. Office vacancy rates in  Manhattan fell to cyclical lows  in August but rents, though still increasing, h ave risen at a less fren zied pace th an last y ear. Purchasing m anagers indicate that manufacturing activity was m ixed but generally strong in Septem ber following brisk growth in increasingly tight credit sta ndards, and few delinquencies. 10/5/99 35 As for the national econom y, while listening to my colleagues around the table, a sign outside The Mayflower Doughnut Shop in m y nativ e city of Chicago ke pt passing through m y mind. That sign was entitled the optim ist’s creed and sai d, “A s you wander on through life, brother, whatever be your goal, keep your eye up on the doughnut and not upon the hole.” It seem s to me that som e people look at the current situation and say: We are experiencing the soon-to-be longest econom ic expansion ever , we have a 4.2 percent unemploym ent rate, we have the unem ployable being employed, and isn’t that terrible! I don ’t think it’s  terrible at all. I think it’s great and wonderful, especially if  we rem ember that our goal in m onetary policy is to prom ote sustainable econom ic growth and th at the tool w e are supposed to use is price stability. With a year-over-year rate of 1.9 percent in  the core CPI at the end of Augus t, I think we surely have price stability. The forecasting m odels of all the Reserve Ba nks and of the Board’s s taff have been consistently wrong in that they hav e forecast infl ation in creases. The sa me models predict that there will be inflation increases in the future. I wonder if at som e point we shouldn’t put in a humility d iscount based on past perf ormance. Perhaps we s hould realize that these f orecas ts, sin ce they have been consistently wrong, are likely to st ay wrong and that, therefor e, the inflation we are concerned about is rather lik e Don Quixot e’s win dmills--a fiction of our o wn minds. We’ve also been very w orried about tight labor m arkets and ye t the tight labor m arkets have not in fact been result ing in inflation, even though we cont inue to worry about them . What concerns m e a great deal is that all of us speak in shorthand and the Am erican people don’t understand our shorthand. If we conti nue to talk about tight labor m arkets as if that is a truly evil phenom enon, we are going to convince the Am erican people that what w e believe in is not price stability, which is for the good of  everybody, but a differentiation in incom e distribution that goes against the working people. That is not a good signal to be giving. I’m sure it’s not a deliberate signal but I think it’s one we are increasingly givi ng. The m ost recent data on the distribution of incom e show the top quintile ge tting 49 percent of the income di stribution and th e bottom  quintile getting just above 3 percent. I don’t think that’s a tim e when th e central bank should be giving a signal that it is opposed to possi ble increases in rem uneration, especially if those increases in remuneration are fina nced by productivity. As I’ve said at previous m eetings, we don’t ha ve to have a firm belief that productivity improve ments are here to stay and that we ar e experien cing o ne of those once-in -a-century phenom ena, although I’m increasingly inc lined to think that we probably are. All we really have to 10/5/99 36 lifestyles of  the le ss fortunate- -with the low une mplo yment rate--is likely to continue for the period to which our current m onetary policy applies, which is one to two years. I am very convinced that that will be the case. As we cons ider our responsibilities, we have to  be very careful that the goal we’re looking toward is price stab ility and not anything else. That price stability is supposed to bring about sustainable econom ic growth, and it is. In my view we  should declare victory on what has been a very good piece of work and stop worryi ng ourselves into believing that we have to stand in the way of som ething th at I think is very positiv e. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. As I said at our last m eeting, and a num ber of people have said agai n at this m eeting, we ar e clearly faced with the issue of whether or not inflation h as reached an inflection po int. Or to put it another way, we have  to decide whether or not aggregate supply and dem and are out of balan ce or becom ing out of balance. Many people around the table have cited argum ents that sugg est in flation is reach ing an inflection po int. Those tend to focus on two things. One is that we have tight labor m arkets, which is norm ally a precursor to som e inflationary pressures. The other is that  som e of the short-term  factors that have held inflation at bay appear to be weakening. Among those are that foreign econom ies, which have given us the benefit of som e of their excess cap acity, are g enerally s trengthening and th at the dollar, whose strength has kept im port prices low,  appears to b e weakening . All of  this is occur ring against a backdrop of what is clearly a very strong dom estic econom y and one in which m any interest-sens itive sec tors clea rly are showing some streng th. However, there are som e strong counter-argum ents to this view. One is that there has been capital deepening, which is conti nuing. We aren’t sure when the run of productivity growth that we’ve benefited from  thus far is going to com e to an end. The second counter-argum ent--and there are weaknesses in it--is that we’ve had an unem ployment rate below 4.5 percent for most of this year and som e of last year and wage dem ands have not been excessive. We have som e new evidence that wage dem ands m ay have changed in some of the union bargaining situations. On the other hand, we’re not yet sure if th at is going to flow over into pric ing or is sim ply going to be a case in whic h dividends will not b e as attrac tive a s they have been. With respec t to th e rest of  the world, it’s certainly true that many econom ies seem to be healing. But Japan, I think, still has a way to go, and its recovery depends very m uch on the ability of its governm ent to borrow and spend. And in som e Southeast Asian econom ies th e funda mentals certainly aren’t very strong. 10/5/99 37 Finally, as a few people have note d, long-term  interest rates have  indeed trended up. Now, one might argue that they’ve trended up but have had no im pact, or very little  impact, thus far. Putting a ll of this toge ther, the risks do seem  slightly out of balance. On the other hand, we should be mindful of the fact that there are m any things we don’t know and that our models have been inaccurate for quite a while. So I do think we are faced with a very  tough choice later today. But at th is stage it seem s to m e that the risks are slightly skewed to the upside.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich.

MR. GRAM LICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. At the last m eeting, I argued that we should do what we’re going to do with interest rates and, absent jarring new inform ation, leave them  alone until the tu rn of the year . Markets pr etty m uch expect us to d o that and I’ m reluctan t to dissent from  this happy consensus. Nevertheless, while th e inform ation that has com e in since the last meeting m ay not qualify as jarring, it  is at least disconcerting, and I f ear that we m ay be close to the time when we have to think about changing policy. Most of this disconcerting inform ation is on the dem and side and som e of it is based on theori es of how the econom y is supposed to work. Let me run down the list. First, because of gridlock problem s on Capito l Hill, governm ent spe nding is likely to be stronger than we had thought. Second, consum ption se ems to be rising at relatively rapid rates and consum er sentim ent is very high, even with a fairly significant stock m arket correction. Third, investm ent soared in the third quarter. The staff has responded to that developm ent largely by shifting investm ent out of the fourth quarter, m aking the overall forecast only a bit stronger. But it increasing upward drift in core inflation. That’s partly tied to an unreliable estim ate of NAIRU, I know, but it is augm ented by increases in comm odity prices, the m inimum wage, autoworker wages, health care co sts, and other s uch factors. Fifth, the u nemploym ent rate is forecast to get to a pretty low level. I recognize what Bill McDonou gh said and I agree that the downward trend in unem ployment is great, but reduced  unem ployment has to be sustaina ble. And sixth, after the Y2K quarter, the flat funds rate version of the forecast now has de mand growt h averag ing about 3½ percent, which is rather strong for an econom y that begins with already extrem ely tight labor But in som e ways the big gest conc ern of all is  the dollar. Let m e spend a m inute discussing that. Previously, when the United States was gr owing at healthy rates an d most of our trading partners were dealing with recession, the U.S. tr ade deficit rose sharply. Then we didn’t worry 10/5/99 38 about im balances. After all, our trading partne rs were getting extra aggregate dem and and the United States was trimming aggregat e dem and. Or from  the capital account standpoint, our trading partners were investing their sa vings at higher rates of return and we were getting a foreign-financed investm ent boom. But now all that is chang ing and our trading partners are begi nning to recover. The goods and services deficit, which is analogous to the prim ary deficit, is $272 billion this year, 3 percent of GDP. In the Greenbook forecast it rises to $345 bill ion in 20 01, 3½ percent of GDP. If we m ake the reasonable assum ption that foreigners will want to lim it the ratio of  their assets here to GDP, this goods and services deficit m ust at som e point  drop to zero. Actually, it m ay be even less than zero if  our r eal in terest rate exceeds our GDP growth rate and/or there is modest dollar depreciation. But 3½ percent of GDP is a long way from  zero. What can bring the U.S. trade deficit into b alance ? The happies t scenario is for foreign GDP to grow m ore rapidly, but unfortunately that scenario cannot help m uch. The staff already has trade- weighted foreign real GDP growth at a 3.4 percent rate over the foreca st horizon and realistica lly it cannot grow m uch faster th an that. I ask ed the staff to sim ulate an extra ½ percent of foreign GDP growt h and that only cut the goods and services de ficit by $10 billion in 2001--essenti ally peanuts. That’s not enough even to elim inate the rise in the ratio of the goods and services deficit to GDP. Another hap py scenario would be to get ther e by low U.S. inflation. In the forecast ou r inflation rate averag es ½ percen t below the trade-weighted inflation rate of  our trading partners. That does lim it the growth in th e trade def icit, bu t it doesn ’t restore the ba lance. And it will not help at all if  our inf lation  rate incr eases. Unfortunately f or this calcula tion, our trading partners either have had serious recessi ons or have been very good at  fighting inflation, with the consequence that their inflation rates are already low enough to larg ely close off this channel. Then we get to less happy scenarios. We could reverse the A sian crisis by having a domestic recession, which I doubt anybody wants. The only reasonable and e ffective way to right the balance, I’m  afraid, is for the dollar to decline by quite a lot--far m ore than the staf f has already incorporated  into th e forecast. We may consider this a ticking tim e bomb or m erely the inev itable after-ef fect of  the health y, stabiliz ing move in  our trade deficit duri ng the Asian crisis. But there ar e two im plications f or monetary po licy. The first is that it’s even m ore important th an in norm al times to sta bilize pr ices.  The best way to get the desired change in our prices relative to foreign prices is price stability here, and we s hould promote that especially in adjusting to the international im balance. The second point is that we should rem ember that the 10/5/99 39 Asian crisis kept a headwind on the U.S. economy. That headwind was a force that tended to push down rates of growth of both a ggregate dem and and inflation--a  nice safety belt should the econom y overheat. Now that is ov er, or at least changing. The wo rld econom y is rebalancing and for the next few years th at headwind is lik ely to b e replaced b y a tailwind that will ten d to push up real g rowth and U.S. inflation. Just when we need low inflation m ore, it will becom e harder to achieve. All of these factors are on the dem and side a nd in principle there co uld be a productivity boom  sufficient to handle all that  dem and without rising inflation. But f or that to happen, the rate of productivity increase mu st increase. That is, the second derivative of productivity m ust be positiv e, which is a dif ficult require ment. And if  it is not m et, the e conomy is in dan ger of  moving to higher, perhaps accelerat ing, rates of inflation.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Kelley.

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. As we’ve all been saying, the econom y is resurging after its second-quarter slump and the in flation new s continues to be highly f avorable. It’s am azing to m e that policy form ulation can becom e more difficult when all the news is good, but it h as. Recent news has m ade our choices still more difficult. As I loo k at the available po licy alternatives, it se ems to m e that a perf ectly p lausible case can be m ade for  at least three different policies. And there is a perfec tly plausible rebuttal argum ent ag ainst each. Yet choose we must, and I’ll leave that discussion for the next phase of our m eeting. Let m e make two brief observations. Many supply side factors that have contributed importantly to this favorable inflation perform ance ar e shifting adversely. Cheap oil has gone away; bargain comm odity prices ar e firm ing; the dollar has ceased to strengthen and has begun to reverse; world dem and for U.S. exports is beginning to increase, further straining our labor force; and interest rates have been ri sing. Our strong productivity surg e has obviously been of vital importance and appears to rem ain vibrantly in place.  But going forward, we m ust judge if it’s safe to depend on that alm ost entirely to keep rising cost pressures at bay. Secondly, the dem and side looks increasingly frot hy to m e. Consum ption is surging, even as consum ers continue to run with a negative sa ving rate. And that, I th ink, introduces the danger of fragility. Consum er sentim ent is rising ag ain from  a consistently elev ated read ing. We will shortly get a new reading, but to date new job form ation continues strong, with m any reports of an inability to fill job openi ngs. We seem to be entering an i nventory cycle of unknown dim ensions. Capital spending rem ains very stro ng and purchasing m anagers report  slower deliveries and higher 10/5/99 40 prices. Housing activity appears to be slowing, but auto sales c ontinue to fly higher and higher, defying gravity. This Comm ittee h as been correct for several yea rs in allowin g the econo my free rein  to grow, and I feel comfortable that we have responsibly tim ed a course  reversal in recent m eetings. Is it now time to rest on our oars a bit?  Perhap s, and a strong case can be--and has been--m ade for that. But I think it’s worth noting that the fed funds rate today is ¼ poi nt below where it was on rate was at 4.5 percent a nd the level of real GDP was 4 percent lower than today. The rate of GDP growth in the third quarter of 1998 was 3.7 percent, s lightly slower than the rate now anticipated in the th ird qua rter of  this year. We must tak e great care no t to risk losing the degree of stability in prices that we have worked so long and hard to achieve and that has served our econom y so well. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I agree with Governor Kelley that today’s remarkably benign. On that basis it would appear to be a reach to argue that there is an urgency to tighten. But the Greenbook tells a different story, one in which the inter actions of tight labor shocks resu lt in a steady rise in inflation over the f orecast peri od. The challenge in our policy risks are tilted toward rising inflation. The inflation news has been so rem arkably good in term s of both com pensation and core prices that it’s easy to lose sight  of a key reality. Overall CPI in flation is projected to increase by almost 1¼ percentage points this ye ar relative to last year. This c ontrasts with a decline of about ½ percen tage p oint in ov erall CPI inf lation last y ear com pared to the prev ious year. This year nominal compensation gains have been  restrained by last year’s dec line in overall inf lation. Next year, in contrast, com pensation will be boosted by the rebound in overall infla tion this year. This developm ent highlights what m ay be a funda mental change in the inflation environm ent. Instead of lower inflation blunting the force of low unem ploym ent rates on nom inal wage changes, rising inflation going forward is likely to reinforce the effects of tight la bor m arkets on nom inal compensation gains. The Greenbook inflation stor y has m any chapters. I’m in broad agreem ent with both the qualitative them es and the quantitative im plications. 10/5/99 41 By m y count there are nine fact ors that contribu te to highe r inflation in this f orecast: (1) tight labor m arkets today; (2) tig hter labor m arkets around the corner ; (3) rising capacity utilization rates; (4) a rebound in nonoil im port prices; (5) the secondary effect s of the sharp rise in energy prices this year; (6) a rebound in benefit costs; (7) an increase in  the m inimum  wage; (8) an upward trend in nonoil comm odity prices; and (9) the sta bilization in trend productivity growth. There is an im portant partial offset from  an as sumed dec lined in energy prices over next year and the following year. But the cards seem  stacked. To be  sure, this is just a forecast. You might say, “Been there,  done that!” [Laughter] Maybe prod uctivity will accelerate further; I cann ot rule that out. Maybe NAIRU is even lower than  the staff estim ate; it could be. But I find th e Greenboo k story line com pelling. If it is wron g, it is lik ely to be a m atter of degree rather than direction. Perhaps it will not take four or more  ¼ percentage point increases in the funds rate to lim it the rise in core CPI to 2½ percen t over the forecast p eriod. But h ow likely is it that we would com e to regret another m ove th is year? The case for tigh ter po licy always seem s more com pelling when near-term  above-trend growth is projected to aggrav ate already tight labor growth than previously expect ed. The outlook for growth was revised upward from  the last Greenbook. Growth appears to have moved again into the above-trend zone and rem ains quite strong, though slightly below trend, in 2000 and 2001. This is the case despite the assum ed tighter monetary po licy and flat equity p rices in the Greenbook forecast. Persistence of stron g growth reflects a co mbination o f still favorable financial conditions even with a tightening, flat equity prices, stronger global growth, a d eclining exchange rate, and increase d fiscal stim ulus. The generally favorite fo recast paradigm  since at least m id-1996, when I arrived at the Board, has been slower growth and rising inflation. One can say the sam e paradigm  is reflected in the current f orecas t. But the slowdo wn in grow th is now m uch m ore m odest and the rise in inflation m ore aggressive. Instead of looking lik e a transition from  excep tional perf ormance to a modestly un comfortable period of stagflation, th e forecast is b eginning to look a little more like a boom /bust s cenario, with the boom  part adm ittedly m ore evident than th e bust in this  part of the forecast. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I believe coff ee is ready. Let’s break for coffee. [Coffee break]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mr. Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. 10/5/99 42 Comm ittee decis ions at this m eeting  woul d seem to be com plicated not only by continuing uncertainty about the sources of the unusually good econom ic perform ance of the United Stat es and how best to sustain it, but also by the possible effects on policy strategy over the near te rm of the com ing century date change. Mike and K aren have d escribed the f orces in the staff forecast that give a distin ct upward tilt to projected inflation over the next few years, even with a m oderate amount of policy tightening next year. Of course, the Comm ittee m ay not share the staff’s concerns, in which case m any of  these co mplications recede. Broad measures of prices and wages behaved re markably f avorably over the inte rmeeting period--m ore so than bef ore the August m eeting. These data, along with the sideways movem ent of t he unem ploym ent ra te this year, sug gest th at to date aggregate supply has been sufficient to satisfy aggregate dem and, even with the econom y operating at a high level and de mand expanding rapidly. If the Comm ittee believes that this balance has a good chan ce of continuing--or wanted to wait a while to see whether it did--it m ay see preem ptive tigh tening as inapprop riate at th is time, especially after tw o preem ptive acti ons at the last two m eetings, and hold policy unchanged. Moreover, in this environm ent, the Comm ittee m ay be sufficiently uncertain th at inf lation is h eaded higher to have no priors about the predom inant weight of infor mation that will be com ing in for a tim e, making an unbiased directive a good desc ription of its pol icy inclinations over the next few months. While m arket participants generally do not expect a change in the stance of policy at this m eeting, a growing numbe r have com e to anticipate that the Comm ittee will adop t and announce a biased d irectiv e. Moreover, m arkets have priced in sig nificant odd s on a tigh tening in Novem ber. If a symmetric d irective is taken as a sign that the chances are g ood that the Comm ittee will be on h old until next year, prices in financial m arkets could rise som e. To the extent the Comm ittee’s choices were seen as dr iven m ore by Y2K concerns than a downplaying of inflation risks, firm ing acti ons for next year should continue to be built into the  yield cu rve, limiting the  extent of the rally. Still, a m ore substantial upward turn in bond and stock prices cannot be ruled out. Even a lim ited rally m ight be counter productive to the Comm ittee’s goals, especially so if the inflation risks were  viewed as substant ial enough to raise the possibility of policy adjustm ents over the next few m onths. The m isimpression that policy was on hold m ight m ake it m ore difficu lt for the Comm ittee to ac t later in the year or m ake m arket adjustm ents m ore wr enching when it did so. And a rally would lessen any check on spending curr ently be ing imparted in f inancial markets. This would be especially serious if the Comm ittee felt that dom estic dem and m ight not slow sufficiently to offset the p ickup in worldwide growth that is already raising commodity prices and exerting pressure on th e foreign exchange va lue o f the dolla r. As Mike noted, incom ing data over the interm eeting period also showed surprisingly persistent strength in various elem ents of dom estic spending. The Comm ittee’s str ategy for dealing with such developm ents m ight depend on its assessm ent both of the degree of  inflation risks and of whether Y2K 10/5/99 43 considerations m ight constrain its actions  at its next m eeting in Novem ber. Considerab le inf ormation will beco me available  between no w and then that could b e of particular help in shedding som e light on the various uncer tainties the Comm ittee faces. On the dem and side, signs sh ould be m ore eviden t about how dom estic spending is responding to the tightening of policy and the m ore general increases in interest rates  and levelin g out  of stock prices of recent m onths. On the su pply side, substantial new data on labor costs--incl uding an ECI and two readings on average hourly earnings--should aid in getting a better fix on whether pressures on costs and prices are likely to be m ounting. And th e two employm ent reports also will prov ide considerable new infor mation on th e balance of supply and dem and. But at the sam e time, those incom ing data will commingle the effects of precau tionary Y2K purchases and th e more fundam ental strength in dem and. The picture in financial m arkets will likely be  even more obscure: Mark ets are likely to be thinne r than usual in m id-November , as m any borrowers will a lready have satisfied their borrowing needs and extended the maturity of  their ob ligations to avoid the year-end. Yield spreads, partic ularly f or short-term credits, should be wide as lenders draw back from  taking ri sks, and are unlikely to provide reliable readings on assessm ents of borrower risk and credit cond itions beyond the century rollov er period. Moreov er, the reactions to policy changes w ill be harder to pred ict, especially if the change is unexpected. If the Committee though t Y2K-related dist ortion s to data and effects on th e fragility of m arket conditions would be a s ubsta ntial barrier to ra ising rates bef ore next February or to publishing an asymmetr ic directive at this or com ing m eetings, and also saw  the inflation risks as quite substantial and likely to intensify over the coming fe w quarters, it m ight be m ore inclined to tighten at this m eeting. A delay of several m onths under these circum stances would tend to accentuate the overshooting of the econom y and require c onsiderably m ore disruptive adjustm ents down the road, especially if perceptions  that the Comm ittee was on hold sparked a substantial rally in financial m arkets. Indeed, if the Comm ittee thought there was a considerable likelihood that tightening would be called fo r in the near term, taking that action at this m eeting and indicating that another m ove was unlikely for a while might re move one elem ent of uncertainty fr om markets--clearing the decks, so to speak, for participants to deal with Y2K. To be effective, h owever, such a statem ent would need to be credible. Reference to  com pleting the retrenchm ent from the 75 basis points of easing last fall m ight be helpf ul. But, tightening at th is meeting would follow a “truly symm etrical” a nnouncement in August, possibly m aking Nonetheless , the greater likelihood is  that Y2K effects will no t rule out action in Novem ber. While m arkets m ay be thin, spreads m ay not be m uch different than they are now if m any people succeed in getting their financing done early. And the backup m echanism s put in place for the discount window and open m arket operations s hould provide the Comm ittee with  som e assurance of protection ag ainst some of the adverse con sequences o f even m ore intense flights to liquidity and safety. As noted, thos e who should be most sensitiv e to th ese considerations, 10/5/99 44 ruled out a Nove mber tightening. And, not all incom ing inform ation will be equally muddied by any precau tionary stock piling for th e centu ry date change. For exam ple, such activity is likely to have a greater distorting e ffect on spending data than on broad m easures of prices and cost s, given the norm al inertia of the latter, except in co mmodity m arkets. Adverse info rmation on labor costs or inflation could cause m arkets to build in  expectation s of Federal Reserve action. Failing to m eet those expectations, without a good econom ic rationale, m ight itself raise questions about the Federal Reserve’s lack of c onfidence in the func tioning of m arkets through the century date rollover period. If the Committee believe s it shou ld be able to tig hten in Nov ember if necessary, it m ight want to keep policy unchanged but consider whether to adopt and publish an asymm etrical directive. The m arket’s response to an asym metric directive wo uld be conditioned in part by recent h istory. Given the Committee’s evident reluctance to announce an asymmetr ical directive in June, m arkets m ight interpret such a dire ctive at th is tim e as indicating  that the Fed eral Res erve was serious ly co nsidering near-term  policy action. The Comm ittee m ight be able to temper this response with the wording of the announcem ent. Still, m arket participants could price in a little higher odds on a firm ing in Nove mber than they now have, with an associated backing up of  intere st rates. Such a reaction would not be a problem  if, in fact, the Comm ittee was concerned ab out inflation  risks, because any firm ing of fi nancia l cond itions wou ld impart some restra int so oner. Notice th at the Federal Reserve was p oised to act would tend to increase the response of financial asset prices to incom ing inform ation and to policymaker statem ents over the interm eeting period. The risk, of course, is that the m arkets might build in a considerably  greater likelihood of tighteni ng than is consistent with the Comm ittee’s assessm ent of the econom ic situation, com plicating your choices in If the Committee were u ncomf ortable with  this risk, but also uncomf ortable with the potential interpretation and m arket resp onse to the announcem ent of an unbiased directive, it could try to find a m iddle way. The experience in June suggests that this will be difficult to pull o ff effe ctively. In that instance, m arkets were surprised to find out well after the announcem ent that som e bias toward tightening w as embedded in a symmetric direct ive. One approach to this apparent inconsistency would be to suspend voti ng on the sentence containing the bias by removing it f rom the operating parag raph until th e Comm ittee has a chan ce to consider the working group’s recom mendati ons next spring, but to convey in an announcem ent the Comm ittee’s ass essment of the balance o f risks to econom ic perform ance. By focusing on what many m embers of the Committee already saw as the im portan t information it had to impart to  markets, this alternative m ight have some attractive features both as a near-term  stop-gap m easure and as a lo nger-term solution to e xcessive we ight being p laced on the Comm ittee’s choice of v ery few standardized words about future policy. And, it could well have the desired effect relative to asymm etry of dam ping m arket responses  to any announcem ent today and to subsequent inform ation. Its possible drawbacks include the potential f or adding 10/5/99 45 to market uncertainties about your attitude  toward policy biases and their m eaning, and the risk that the precedent it set would narrow th e Comm ittee’s options when the subcom mittee reports back nex t spring. Finally, th e Comm ittee could  vote for an asymm etric directive.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions  for Don?  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Don, you began your rem arks and th en referred again later to the point that aggregate dem and and aggregate supply, if anythi ng, look better balanced now than before. You cited, if I heard you right, evidence of balance in the data that have been released on labor m arkets and price markets. If I were doing assessm ents of risks to the dom estic econom y, let alone other risks in other places in the worl d as I once did, I would not have l ooked at these data as indicative of a finely balanced situation. In looking at the num bers for the pa st and at the projections for the next two years, I would note how m uch of no minal spending is consum ption, the negative saving rate, the gro wth in cred it, and the gro wth in m oney. I would exam ine all the variables one m ight want to look at and I would say that there are so me serious questi ons about the stance of policy in this country, and I would say the econom y is not well balanced. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think one can differentiate between where we’ve been and where we’re projected to go in that regard. I absolutely agree with your  characterizatio n of the forecast. It is no t a balanced forecas t. Aggregate demand exceeds a ggregate su pply. There are upward pressures on inflation. And im plicitly in the forecast the une mploym ent rate needs to  rise by a significant amount before dem and is brought down. Growth n eeds to slow and the unem ploym ent rate needs to rise before dem and and suppl y are brought into balance. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. I’m not at all convinced that the unem ployment ra te ha s to rise, but I am convinced that the trade balance can not stay where it is, let alone continue to rise. Other people said it better than I did: We need to see this tr end reversed. At som e point the United States n eeds to stop being a net absorber of world savings and b ecom e a net supplier of savi ngs to the rest of the world. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Looking back, one could say that aggregate supply and demand have been in balance, at least in total, as  eviden ced by what has been hap pening to p rices. But there are elem ents of im balance within that total. We’ve talked about this before, certainly, and one such elem ent is the current account defi cit and the trade balanc e. Another that peopl e often cite is the level of  asset prices- -particularly the level of  stock m arket prices, which s eem out of balance with reasonable expectations of earnings  and reasonable disc ount factors for risky assets. I think how 10/5/99 46 that international im balance is corrected is ve ry key. Governor Gram lich brought up a couple of possibilities. One possib ility that we modeled in a previous  Bluebook--that would have been in stock m arket levels out and starts heading down in part because other places  appear to be better places to inv est than the United States. U.S. savi ng rates b egin to ris e as wealth-to-in come ratios fall. We cut back consu mption, and exports beg in to rep lace that con sumption. In that exam ple we actually had a fairly easy restor ation of  balance within the agg regate dem and sector and kept the balance between aggregate supply and dem and as well. It’s v ery ha rd to te ll wha t will h appen. Certain ly the r isks, as  Karen John son and othe rs have pointed out, would be that before saving increases in the United States, the willingness of others to ship their savings to us to accum ulate more dolla r assets d eclin es. And we’d have what looks like an exogenous shift in the dem and for dollars, putting downward pressure on the dollar. So there is a risk involved that would add to in flation pressures as well as to dem and on the United States. But I think it is v ery cru cial how that correction occurs and what is happening to dom estic demand at the tim e it occurs. Rather than focusing on just that piece by itse lf, the co ntext in which these developm ents occur has to be ta ken into account as well. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Any fu rther questions for Don?  If not, let m e get started. We have a very difficult set of i ssues to evalu ate. The reason re lates largely to what I s ee as growing evidence that the m odels with which we have been trying to explain how the Am erican econom y functions are becom ing increas ingly obsolete. It is not th at the econom etric structure of the m odels is inappropriate, but certain sim ple assum ptions are m ade in their structu re that are driving the results we observe and are creating at leas t the p resum ption that we are m issing something important. Let m e just say very s imply-- this is r eally a repetition of what I’ve be en saying in the past-­that we have all been brought up to a greater or lesser extent on  the presumption that the supply side is a very stable force. The assumption has been that the working-age population is increasing at a fairly predictable rate and that trend produc tivity is growing at a fairly stable one percent annual rate. So, the presum ption has been that we could look at the supply side as an independent variable in the com plex interaction of our equa tions. That presum ption generally has been not challenged largely b ecause it h as worked. But what people around the tab le have been  saying is that third-quarter growth  has rebounded quite substantially. And indeed it has. So has productivity growth. 10/5/99 47 In my judgm ent our m odels fail to account appropriately for the interaction between the supply side and the dem and side larg ely becau se hist orically it has not b een necessary for them  to do so. A crucial variable in our m odels is trend productivity growt h, and the conventional procedure in  our quarterly forecasts is to specify a constan t trend ra te of productivity growth. Yet, our official figures indicate that the growth in productivity has been m oving up at an annual rate of around ½ percent each y ear sin ce early 1997. On top of that, the rev iew o f 1995 to 1997 in retro spect is adding another 0.3 percentage po int to  the annu al rate of gr owth in the most recen t years. So what we have, in effect, is a set of  trend productivity values whose second derivative has been positive. We have two choices. We can either pr oject a continuation of the positive second derivative fo r productivity, or we can  assum e that the second derivative g oes to zero and we will have a flat productivity growth rate. You m ay say that there are ar guments for both. And indeed, as I will m ake a case in a mom ent, there are. But we have cho sen the se cond autom atically. As a r esult, we- -as well as everyone w ho has the sam e structural m odel--hav e created a necessary o utcom e because of the algebra of our m odels. It is algebraically necessary for such models to project  a rise in inf lation if they inco rporate a constant rate  of growth in productivity and we have a very low unemploym ent rate, which presum ably creates som e pressure fo r wages to increase m ore rapidly than the trend productivity rate. I will stipulate that that is ex actly the situation we are looking at and one that has always been associated  with rising inflation. What is the case for autom atically assum ing th at the second derivative of productivity goes to zero? Certainly the most recent productivity data--whether we are l ooking at growth rates calcu lated o n a four-quarter m oving average b asis, a two-quarter basis, or any other basis we want to use--do n ot confirm  that assum ption because all t hose data indicate th at the ra te of growth in productivity has been rising. Then the question is why this happens. When we engage in growth accounting analysis in an effort to get to the bo ttom of this, we find, as Governor Ferguson said, that there has been a very signifi cant increase in capital deepening. That m eans, in effect, that we are getting very substantial acceleration in the gr owth of the stock of cap ital--o r, to b e more precis e, cap ital s ervices. In addition, we clearly are getting ev idence of ac celeration in  multifactor productivity, the residual in growth  accounting, which is another wa y of saying that the synergies of productivity-enhancing investm ents are com ing together and in the process are creating an acceleration in productiv ity. What this  implies, if  it is tru e, is that we shou ld be seeing a fairly 10/5/99 48 compensation or to a variety of other m easures th at productiv ity m ay spill into  such as real wages. I have raised the issue before as a hypothesis, and I think the anecdotal ev idence as well as the data are increasingly supportive. That is, there appears to be as a consequence of productivity gains a very m arked and at the m oment persistent rise in expected rates of return on new plant and equipm ent. We can get that from  a num ber of diff erent calculations. We can get it from one of the calculations I like to use, which is a rough endeavor to weight changes in productivity and in capacity--th e two m ajor elem ents to ward which capit al expenditures are direct ed. We try to infer using som e simplifying assum ptions what part of the increase in productivity that we observe plus the increas e in capacity is attribu table to a specific  year’s capital investm ent. When we do that we find, not unexpectedly, a very  significant acceleration in the rate of return for each recent year’s capital investm ent. I don’t want to get into the em bodied technology problem s, which are tricky here, but the m ost revealing indicatio n that the rates of return are ve ry high and rising is to observe the behavior of capital investm ent. It sim ply is not cred ible that we could be getting the type of boom  in capital investment that we are observ ing, and one that is accelerating, if the plant managers who are in fact initiating these investm ents have not been getti ng th e returns tha t they expected. We also see, as I have m entioned previous ly, a fairly continuous upward revision on the part of secu rity analysts of their long -term  forecasts for earn ings. The las t observatio n we have is for the m onth of September, and this num ber is at a record high. It is con tinuing to rise. I’m not saying th at these forecas ts are any go od as far as earnings p rojections are concerned. Indeed, they’re awful. They are biased on th e upside, as they are m ade by people who are getting paid largely to project rising earnings in order to sell  stocks, which is the business of the people who employ them. But the question really is how m uch the bias has changed over the relatively short period of tim e in which there h as been this d ramatic acceleration of the rate  of retu rn in all the measures, starting in 1995. After ta lking to a lot o f these analy sts, the answer as far as I’m concerned is  that co rporate execu tives, from  whom they get the inform ation they use for projecting the earnings of the individual com panies, ar e telling them  that they a re consisten tly lo wering the ir costs. And the way they lower the ir costs is essen tially th rough labor-d isplacing cap ital investm ent. They don’t use the term  “labor-dis placing;” they use “cost.” But as we know, on a consolidated basis, 70 percent of co st is labor. And if we are ge tting an increasi ng amount of labor-displacing investm ent, by definition we  are getting an increase in output per hour. If we are getting 10/5/99 49 an increase in output per hour, we al so are getting  an increase in real  inco me. And if we are getting an increase in real income, we are going to get an increase in personal consum ption expenditures. Indeed, if we look at the whole pattern that is  involved, there’s a ve ry interesting question of when structural productivity grow th is going to be  adequate to offset the growth that is occurring on the dem and side. I would argue that we m ay be asking the wrong question, because it m ay well be that it’s the productivity accel eration that is engendering the grow th on the dem and side, directly and indirectly--directly obviously through income and indirectly through th e increase in capital asset va lues.  That is, lea ving aside the question of price-earnings  ratios and whether there is a bubble, there is no ques tion that a significant part of the increase in the mark et value of equities and other as sets reflects the f act th at prod uctiv ity has accelerated. If we look at a breakdow n of the supply side of  the econom y, what we end up with is that the total change in GDP is algebr aically equal to structural productiv ity growth plus the growth in the labor force or the working age population or som e similar measure. And leaving aside a number of m inor issues such as average hours and statistical discrepa ncies--which are not unim portant--we find that the m easure of the differe nce b etween the ch ange in GDP and the sum  of labor force growth plus structural productivity gr owth is effectively som e measure of changing unem ployment. And declining unemp loym ent is very likely  the cons equence of the wealth effect, which is boosting consumption over and above what is  norm ally expected of PCE out of incom e. Whether in curren t circu mstances it will be poss ible to of fset the inc rease in dem and on the cost side, I think, is the wrong que stion to ask. That’s because it is by no m eans evident that the current expansion is going to slow  at all. The reason is that if  productivity is continuing to accelerate and we put th at into our econom etric m odel, we are not go ing to get a slow down in econom ic activity. We are going to g et motor vehicl e sales po ssibly of 20 m illion at an  annual rate instead of, say, 17 m illion. We are going to get h ousing starts  of, say, 2 million and no t 1.5 m illion because g ross dom estic incom e and gross dom estic p roduct--leaving ou t the discrepan cy, as I hav e indicated previously--have to balance. The reason I raise this qu estion is th at we ar e seeing a rem arkable ac celeration in eco nomic activity now , which under our old regim e where the suppl y side is relatively stable would lead us to say that this expansion is getting dram atically out of hand. But let us turn the thing around by supposing th at ins tead of  putting a flat productivity growth path into our m odels we put in a positiv e second derivative. That would m ean that pr oductiv ity growth would continu e to increas e. I subm it to you that if we do that and it happens, we are not going to get a slowdown in econom ic 10/5/99 50 activ ity. We will com e to the nex t meeting and say tha t the m arkets are going berse rk and that there is a consum er binge in progress. Indeed, that is what has to happen. The key question we have to ask ourselves is whether this is an ove rheated econom y. Is it unsu stainable and do we need to apply the brakes?  I think th e answer at this stage is that  we don’t really know for sure. If I were doing a forecast, I could m ake the ca se as to why I might put in a non-zero second derivative for structural productivity --just leave it there, run our projection, and then discuss it. Or I might do precisely the opposite, whic h is what Mike Prell and his colleagues have done, and keep the structu ral productivity growth rate flat and disc uss that. I will subm it to you that n either cas e is easy to m ake and that there is evidence to support bot h cases, as I think Mike Kelley has indicated. The presumption that, logically and necessarily, the only cho ice we can make at this stage is to u se the flat productiv ity gro wth rate is u nverif iable in m y view. As a consequence, I think it is important for us to recognize that this is a very unusual period. It is extraordinary to have, as the forecas t in the G reenbook, a tre nd productivity growth rate that rises from  an annual rate  of about 1 percent to 2.3 percent when in effect we already have nonfar m productivity rising in the last  four quarters to a rate of 3.2 percent. If we look at the growth of GDP from  the incom e side and use the household hours-worked  data, which are then consistent w ith the unemploym ent rate, we get a still faster accelerati on in productivity. The reason why the unem ploym ent rate has been stable at 4.2 percent or thereabout s at a tim e when our productivity growth numbers have not looked all that sign ificant relative to the rapid growth of output is that we are m easuring productivity with  hours from  the payroll survey. But the payroll survey numbers have been rising at an aver age of 50,000 to 70,000 people per m onth in excess of the rise in the adjusted household data. Average weekly hours look the sam e, meaning that the growth in total hours from the payr oll survey has been far m ore in the las t two or three years af ter being closely parallel to that of the household survey data. As a consequence, if we did nothing but look at the household data--the unemploym ent ra te, the changes in em ploym ent, and the hours data--we would end up with a far more  rapid rise in productivity growth. So, I would say that the issue is no t whether productiv ity can grow fast enough to k eep pace with dem and growth. We are dealing with a s imultaneously structured econom y in which the very forces that are driving productivity--prim arily technology--are boosting the incom e side and the capital assets side, both of whic h are having an impact on the dem and side. I think it is essential for us to recognize that we have th is kind of interaction. If we don’t, we very well could be looking 10/5/99 51 at a benign expansion on the dem and side that is being fostered wholly by increased productivity and wrongly view it as overheating. I am not saying tha t the evidence is com pletely  consistent w ith the argum ent I have just made. Even with that argum ent, we still have a significan t wealth effect, so that actual dem and growth is in excess of potential s upply; but both are rising very rapidly. All I can say is that at th is particular stage the num ber of workers who are seeki ng jobs is decreasing. As that number shrinks, real com pensation p er hour obviously will m ove we ll ahead o f productivity at som e point, in which case inflatio n will take p lace. So, ev en under m y assum ption that the seco nd derivativ e is positiv e, all that does is to prevent unit labor costs from  rising for a while. But at som e point, that process engenders greater growth in real compensation per hour than in producti vity, which itself is accelerating,  and at th e end of the day we end up with acceleration in prices. The difference between the two scenar ios is tha t the tim e frames are dram atically different. In one case we are looking at acceleration in inflati on almost imm ediately as we get into the year 2000, while the o ther scenario delays the whole proces s--perhaps quite signifi cantly. Moreover, it m ay very well be, as I think a num ber of us are expecting, that the wealth  effect will finally s immer down because of the existence of a bubble th at can’t persis t and that the two effects will converge and there will be no inflation ary im balances. I didn’t m ean to get into this long lecture, but after listening to wh at we’ve been talking about I have the uncom fortable feeling that we ar e misreading the econom ic signals. That said, let me go on quickly to a couple of other issues. Two or three of you m entioned m oney supply grow th. As you know, if velocity is constant the desired money supply growth fo r zero inflation should basically be  the sum  of the growth in the civilian labo r force, the g rowth in  productivity, and the extent to which the CPI is biased upward. That com es out very approxim ately to an annual rate of about 5 percent. That rate is not all that far from  where we are, especially after adjusting for Y2K. So, looking at policy from  the money supply side, I’m  not terribly certain that we are v ery far off. You will reca ll that the annual rang es selected are based on a 1 percent productivity growth trend. We deci ded not to put in an allowance for higher productivity and I think ad visedly so. But let’s not fool ourselves as to the fact that norm al money supply growth is affected by the rate of growth in productivity. Finally, let m e just say that th ere are a num ber of things that we can spot to know that the econom ic process is running into trouble. For exam ple, if we  see domestic operating profit 10/5/99 52 productivity growth is no longer accelerating and that would be a signal that som ething is going wrong. That would m ean the second  derivative is no longer positiv e, or we are getting down to the bottom  of the em ploym ent barrel where real com pensation per hour begins to m ove well ahead of even accelerating p roductivity growth. We see nothing of that sort at the mo ment. Growth in total unit costs is still declin ing. Growth in unit labor costs is still declining. We have productivity growth data through the second qua rter for the total and through August for m anufacturing. The latter is not a forecast; the indus trial production and hours data that we already have n ow show that productivity is up quite sharply. I subm it that we have a very com plex set of pr oblem s to deal with, and we have to exercise a bit of humility in looking at the m odels we are em ploying to reflect re ality, as a number of you have said. Because we have used a zero second derivative fo r productivity in every fo recast, we have underestim ated real econom ic growth and overestim ated inflation. A lot of you have mentioned that. I subm it that we are doing it again. That does not m ean it’s the wrong thing to do, but I do wish to suggest that th ere is an alternative assum ption. The difference is whether you consider the first derivative to be positive and constant or you wish  to add a second derivative that is also po sitive. I am saying that the most recen t trend would argue in fav or of the second alternative, which is just an extr apolation of what has been occurr ing. The question is whether that assum ption is valid. I com e to the basic conclusion th at we really don’t know at this  stage. We do know, as Jack Guynn m entioned, that a lot of people in the tech nology area are saying that  we are only at the beginning of  a big productivity grow th process. That’s probably true, but it doesn’t tell us m uch about the outlook for actual producti vity growth over the projection period. If, for exam ple, as Lew Gerstner of IBM has suggested, we are a third of the way through the investm ent in unexploited technology, we still have two-thirds to go. It is quite possible that the one-third has been m oving at a very fast pace and  that the two -thirds will move at a much slower p ace. Under those cond itions productivity g rowth  will fall, ev en though th e level of productiv ity itself continu es to rise. We can’t sim ply argue that innovation has a long way to go and c onclude that productivity growth will either stay u p where it is or go higher in th is period. That’s a non sequitu r. It dep ends entirely on the tim e horizon over which that rem aining two-thirds of inno vation is exploited. Having gone on far longer than I had anticipated, let m e just get to what I hope is the bottom  line. My own judgm ent is that havi ng done 50 basis points a nd having seen a very significant rise in corporate bond yields--as you know they are up sign ificantly m ore than 10/5/99 53 Treasuries--I think we ought to wait  at this point to see what happens as a conse quence of that rise. Nonetheless, if we do vote for “B,” I would prefer  not to give a m essage that we are necessarily through for the year. I think it would be a m istake in the current context to  leave the presum ption in the m arketplace that the Federal Reserve is  quiescent and is not concerned about what m ay emerge over the balance of the year. Consequent ly, I would favor asymm etry, and I would have no difficulty with that if we were still on our ol d regim e where we just voted for asymmetry and published our decision about six weeks later. In my view we have a seconda ry set of disclosure problem s, which Don Kohn raised, that are unrelated to the policy decision itself. As I see it, we created a very difficult problem  when we started to announce our symm etry/a symm etry decision. I wish we had not done it but, frankly, I don’t know how to get out of it. But if we are goi ng to be fully forthcom ing in our accountability to Congress and to the electorate, we are going to do things th at in hindsig ht we probably will wis h we had not done. The answer is not to stop doing them . We have to live with  certain m istakes that we m ake because th ey are irreversib le. I am not ar guing that we should not have  tried ; I just regret that we did not succeed. All this leaves us with a ve ry tricky question. If we agre e to adopt asym metry, we could announce our decision in the usual manner. That is, we would just announce it. My preference, which is not a big one I must say, would be to tr y to convey the sam e message in a press statem ent as distinct from  indicating very specifically that we are asym metric. In a sense that would am ount to publishing our consensus of where we think we are like ly to be af ter th e usual six- or seven-week intermeeting p eriod. I don’t like the im plication that we ar e comm itted in one direction. In fact, we never did say w e were going to publish our asymm etry or symmetry decision after every meeting. All we said was that we would convey infor mation about im portant changes in our thinking. We can convey that so rt of inform ation, probably in  a more sensitiv e manner, in the language of a press statem ent. Therefore, I woul d prefer, if we adopt “B” asymm etric, that we convey the asymmetry in a statem ent rather than  in a direct announcem ent of its adoption, which has all sorts of bells and whis tles ass ociated with  it. There is an alternative, which would involve  announcing that we have decided to put the issue of symm etry and asymm etry aside pending the outcom e of the Ferguson subcomm ittee’s evaluation and recomm endations. That essentially would say that we are not going to incorporate any reference to symm etry in our directives for a while. That’s a possibility and m embers of the Comm ittee m ay find that useful. Frankly, I find none of the three alternatives id eal. T he ideal 10/5/99 54 would be for us to have stayed where we were , but we are beyond that now and I don’t think we have the choice of going back. So, I have two recommendations to put on the ta ble. One is my hope that we can at this stage put our policy on hold for a while. With Y2K apparently com ing under som e control, even though I am  wondering about the inventory data, I don’t see a problem  should we decide to m ove in Novem ber. I do th ink we would have a prob lem in December, but I b elieve th e Novem ber window is still op en. If we conclude then, after looking at th e substan tial am ount of data we will be getting in  the in terim, that a further advance w ould be appropriate in N ovem ber, I see no reason why we can’t m ove at that tim e. I don’t think our po licy stance is far from where we want it to be. I don’t think we are behind the curve. My im pression is that the m arkets have interpreted our policy m oves as preem ptive and regard us as credib le. I don’t think we are on the edge of a m ajor breakout of inflation. I see that as  the m ost non-credible prospect at  this point. A price erosion on the upsid e is definitely possible, but not one that occurs rapidly. The m ore like ly thing that m ay happen, if som ething happens abrup tly, is in the other direction. The stock m arket could crash and, as the wealth effect im plodes, we actually coul d end up eventually m oving in the other direction. At any rate, I would like to put “B” asymmetr ic on the table and request som e views on how we should proceed with regard to m aking our decision public. If we  choose an asymm etric directive, our alternatives woul d seem to be: (1) issuing a statem ent with no referen ce to symmetry; (2) explicitly announci ng that we went asymm etric; or (3) tem porarily rem oving the symmetry question from  our directiv e and annou ncing that we are do ing that pending what we will

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH. Mr. Chairm an, I very much support the “B” part of your recom mendation. As for how we handle the verb iage, you and others m ay remem ber that I’ve tried to m ake the distinction in pr evious m eetings of asymm etry being eith er strategic or tactical. If we publish som e verbiage that describes our assessm ent of the balance of ri sks but do not say that we are asym metric, I think we would in fact be m aking that distinction between strategic asymm etry and tactical asymm etry. I believe that is a good thing. I share your view that at the meeting, since it’s so close to the Y2K date, we m ight not have m uch freedom . But as you are all probably aw are, I think o ur Decem ber m eeting is always too late. The m arkets are ess entially closed for the year and, therefore,  it’s a very awkward m eeting for us to take any action. As we 10/5/99 55 plan m eetings for the future, I’d be very m uch happier if we could m ove the Decem ber m eeting date forward so we’d still have som e functi oning m arkets when we m ight actually need them . As for the third possibility of announcing that we’re putting symm etry and asymm etry aside until Roger Ferguson’s group reports, I rather lik e that. But I think it  would be very, v ery difficult to explain in a way that would not  com e across as a bit ludicrous. So I share your view that the best thing to do is to have “B” with strategic asymmetry, which m eans that we would use verbiage rathe r than the word “as ymm etric.”

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairm an, once again your pr esentation was a m ost interesting one. I felt as if I w as riding a roller coaster for a while . [Laughter] Sometimes when you start out and begin to talk about accelerating productivity, I feel a bit of discomfort. But I’ve heard it often enough to know that if I’m  patient  and just sit back, we’re goi ng to end up pretty m uch in agreem ent. Nevertheless, I was holding on to  my chair! [Laughter] But soon enough you cam e back and we agreed that th ere are tig ht labo r markets and potential inflation risks. The story is that we have two scenarios out there. We have the Greenbook scenario with constant trend productivity growt h. That’s the one I’m  com fortable with and that’s why I am concerned about inflation risks. We have your al ternative--one that’s ce rtainly shared by others around the table--that we could con tinue to see a ccelerating productivity  grow th. Clearly, the task here is to make m onetary policy fully respecting that  uncertainty. That might be a little too sim ple, though, because we m ight really want to ask th e question of ju st how m uch of an acceleration of productivity would be required to ov erturn the increase of inflation that’s in the forecast. At any rate, at tim es like this I like a maximin type of strategy that looks  at each of these sce narios and pairs it with the wrong policy action to see how bad the outcom e is. It seem s to m e that if we have the wrong policy with the constant productivity gr owth scenario, we have  a rather unpleasant outcom e ahead of us. However, if we begin to tighten and you’re right that productivity gr owth is accelerating, it’s just hard to see, given the fact  that rates of return are rising so aggressively in the econom y, that very m uch dam age is going to be done. The bottom line here is that I’d be very uncom fortable if you had said that in light of your optim ism about productivity the place to be was at no change with a symm etric directive. I do appreciate the l eadership you provided in bringing us toward a consensus. We have a variety of options and I think I could live with a num ber of them. 10/5/99 56 I have m ore than a slight preference f or goi ng “B ” asymm etric and publishing it because the artifice of saying that we’re not going to say we’re asymm etric but use la nguage that reflects our bias in that direction will seem  stran ge to ev erybody. People will note th at we used asymmetric language in our policy release bu t didn’t want to u se the word in the d irective and will then worry about that. In this circum stance we have the bene fit that the m arkets expect, m ore than any other outcom e, the decision today to be no change as ymmetric. There was a s urvey in Sto ne and McCarthy in which 46 percent of the respondents e xpected that outcom e. That was the largest single expectation. I think that gi ves us som e opportunity to get th e job done with an appropriate announcem ent. But if the preference were for doing it and saying that we weren’t going to vote on symmetry or asymm etry but reflect it in the announcem ent, I think that w ould be fine too. I would prefer not to  adopt “B” asymmetric and say we will let people find out in s ix or eight w eeks. That I don’t like. But I think an announcem ent to the m arkets that doesn’t m islead them  about what our assessm ent of the balan ce of risk s is today would be appropriate. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you. First, let m e say that with respect to your overall recomm endation, I think you’re right on “B” and on some indication of asymm etry. I would join with Governor Meyer in saying--and this goes back to a staff paper th at cam e out earlier--that if in fact productivity isn’t picking up, then we clearly  want to tighten to bring supply and dem and closer into balance. If it turn s out that productivity in the second derivative sense is continuing to grow, as Governor Meyer said and as  I think the staff paper also indi cated  earlier, that is consisten t with a higher equilibrium rate of in terest. So in a sense, as hard as the decision is, in som e ways it’s an easy decision. On the communications  issue, let m e first tell  the Comm ittee what the w orking grou p talked about yesterday because we asked ourselves what we should do in the interim  before we com plete our task. We started with the thought that pe rhaps we should sim ply no longer vote on symmetry or asymm etry. But then we were concerned that  we would be doing two things: (1) prejudging an outcom e and (2) putting us in a position where we hadn’t really thought thr ough the implications. We would be rushing through som ething and we wouldn’t be sure how to communicate it and so forth. Other m embers of the working group can speak to this, but I think we were m ost uncomfortable with your third option--announcing that we’re thi nking about this and therefore aren’t voting on symme try or asymm etry. 10/5/99 57 As to m y personal preference, I would be incl ined to go in the direction that Governor Meyer indicated, which is to be quite clear that we’ve voted for a bias toward asymm etry. If the consensus is that we don’t want to announce the as ymmetry but let words about  the balance of risks cover it, then I would be supportiv e of that. My reason is that, as I think about what happened when we first went down this path, the m arket reaction to our announcing the asymm etry was not particularly jarring. On the othe r hand, the m arket reaction to a num ber of statem ents that occurred afterwards started to get more jarring. So I thi nk we should learn the lesson accurately. It was not being transp arent that w as the issue. It was m uch more, for lack of better words, a case of needing a bit of discipline. So I think we could manage an asymm etry announcem ent if we a re a discip lined Comm ittee. I have a slig ht pref erence for doing that becau se I know--or m aybe I should say I assum e--we will con tinue to be disciplined. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Third derivativ e! [Laughter] President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. Let m e start firs t with this question of symmetry or asymm etry. I think everybody knows my views on that, but I’d just  like to rem ind everyone that there was an action in August following our a doption of a symmetric directive on June 30th. So having a symmetric directive now doe sn’t preclude an action. My basic assum ption is that there will be enou gh speeches and press co mmentary and quotes for us to s ignal m arkets if that’s necessary. It seem s to happen all the tim e. On the question of policy objectives, though, it’s one thing when we have a high inflation environm ent--whether it’s a high, single-digit infla tion rate let alone a doubl e-digit rate--to bring it down using rhetoric like price stab ility, zero inflation, and other term s like that. I think it’s quite different when we have achieved an  environm ent that by m ost statis tical m easures is som ewhere in the zone at least of what those words are taken to  mean. That m akes it m ore difficult to try to find a way of communicating why we do things when we  do. That’s because I think we m ostly would agree that taking anyone’s statistical m easure as an  objective of policy and sa ying raise this, plus or minus, woul d be the wrong thing to do. I agree that we’re hav ing a productivity surp rise that is very positiv e and significan t. I hope it continues. And I’m  very willi ng to base policy on the assumption th at it’s true. But I also know that it’s not evenly distributed throughout the econom y. Certain se ctors or industries have very pronounced favorable productivity surprises--computers, telecommunications, a nd the like. Others have none at all, like the m arina where I keep m y boat, which raised m y fee 10 percent. And som e 10/5/99 58 even have a negative--declining productivity--because of a decline in the quali ty of the labor pool they have to work with and so forth. All that is no doubt true. I also know that when there is a favorable pr oductivity surprise, it’s like a bum per crop. We’re going to have a relative pr ice effect. Relative price effect s can com e about either from  a of things with no productivity rise  or, more likely, som e com bination of the two. The question is: Do we have overall m onetary stability when so me prices--on item s where there is no favorable productivity--rise?  Clearly not. Under a gold standa rd, all of the wealth gains are m anifested and distributed in higher purchasing pow er of m oney;  when you don’t have price rises at the m arina, you have price declines at the es tablishm ent where you have coffee. Now, overall, I wouldn’t worry about all th is too much except for the interm ediation process. The way the credit m arkets work through the banking system , I worry about asset price increases in a relativ e price sense --relative to goods prices--w hen thos e assets are financed in way s that m ake those price rises unsustainable. And though I know that a second derivative can be positiv e for a while, I als o know that the second d erivative for nothing in the univers e is positive forever. It must always go to zer o if not negative. So I worry a bout the second derivatives of asset prices b eing positiv e--financed by the banking ind ustry or p ension funds or life in suran ce companies-- and the pr ices getting to  unsustain able lev els. When that ine vitab le poin t com es where the second d erivative m ust go to zero  or negative for asset prices, people w ill find out that they’ve made a m istake and then  we will hav e a cred it crunch. We will h ave a de bt/def icit cycle th at becom es a problem . So overall m onetary s tability in the zon e we’re in still leave s us with a challenge. Even if the projection f or the CPI ov er the forecast horizon were 1 percent and not rising, I would still say that we have a challenge of achieving overa ll monetary stability that is sustain able. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I support “B” asymmetr ic. I want to talk about the disclosure issue in a m inute, but let m e first say that I think “B” is the right pl ace to be. Even though we have all these uncertainties about both productivity growth and labor for ce participation, there is always the possibility that with very favorable surprise s we would end up with lo wer inf lation than the point f oreca st. And I do n’t th ink tha t’s a bad ou tcom e, given that I still b elieve we ha ve a positive , though very sm all, rate of inflation in the econom y in a trend sense. 10/5/99 59 The way I want to look at this situation is to recognize that a lo t of the stabilization work is being done by the m arket and eventu ally, I’ll say, “ratifie d” by the Fed--but gr anting that the Fed has estab lished the bas is for such a stable env ironment. So we want our comm unication with the to me that if we do not publish som e notion of as ymm etry at this point, w e may well be indicating to the m arket that we think our policy adjustm ents are com pleted. I think  that’s the w ay the m arket would read it. Therefore, upward surprises or ve ry strong data, which are what we expect to see coming down the pike, m ight not move  interest rates in th e way that would be constructive over the longer run. So I believe we do want  to indicate that we are asymme tric, whatever language we use, so that we w ill get the right m arket responses as the data come in. If the d ata com e in on the low side or are very benign, then we would get the response that we need out of that, too. In term s of what to publish, part of the i ssue--m aybe a good part of  it--stem s from  our statem ent that we would publish sym metry or the  lack th ereof  from time to tim e when we f elt it was particularly im portant. So I think som e of the m arket overre action, as we read it, has com e about becau se the m arket believes w e’re really tryi ng to tell it som ething. In my view, the best way out of this is to indicate to the m arket that we expect to have a statem ent after every m eeting, although in practice m any of those st atem ents might be very routine boilerplate that doesn’t really say anything. But we could try to take som e of the special ring out of a st atem ent by saying that we now intend to issue statem ents routinely after ever y meeting. That to m e is what I would call the least unsatisfactory way of  getting out of the situation we find ourselves in at this point. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. I agree with the “B” option he re. Given the two m oves we’ve taken and balancing the supply side and the dem and side un certainties, I think “B” is right. However, I believe we could undo a lot of the good we’re going to do with a “B” decision by fooling around with this asymmetry and symmetry issue at this m eeting. Our experience with announcing asymm etrical directives has not worked very well. It may work better in the future. I’m hopeful that Roger a nd his collea gues will co me up with so mething that will m ake it work. But a f ormal asymm etric directive, w hen it is at best a confusi ng tool and at a tim e when  we want to keep open our options because of u ncertainti es about what’s going on in the econo my, really is foolhardy. I feel very s trongly that we ought not have a fo rmal asymm etric direct ive because it w ill end up doing m ore harm  than good. 10/5/99 60 I view the use of words as m ore prom ising, however, because words can help us lay out a framework for our thinking about incom ing inform ation and policy. We may very well want to tighten in N ovem ber, but we m ay not want to tighten. So I don’t th ink we want to box ourselves in by the language that we use, and an asymm etric directive runs a big risk of boxing us in. Words, if carefully chosen, can give the slant that we want without loading the dice. And this is a tim e above all when we want the m arkets to know that, yes,  we m ay tighten, but we m ay not. It is not a foregone conclusion. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, before I cam e to this m eeting I concluded from  reading the staff docum entation that the Bluebook didn’t m ake a very strong case for tightening but that the Greenbook really did. The Greenbo ok projection m ay be wrong but I’m just not prepared to discount it to the extent that I think you have. I believ e the comm ents that you m ade--I had to ho ld on to m y seat as Larry Meyer did--were a very useful  reminder. I really do. But at the end of the day, I think we’re still ju st very, very uncertain about what’s happening to the second derivative of productivity growth. So that’s where I’m  com ing from . And against that background, what we have is very strong growth in dom estic dem and and continued tightening in dom estic labor unem ployment. But to be concerned about the possi bility that dem and growth is not sustainable is a legitim ate worry for this group. Moreover, the Greenbook at least is projecting a rather steady increase in core inflation from  about 2 percent this  year to 3 percent in 2001. That strikes m e as a plausible projection, given what is  happening to som e intermediate  prices and given the kind of anecdotal infor mation Jack Guynn offered about attitudes toward pric ing power. We hear a little of the sam e thing in our District. And finally, I was interested in one of  the alternative sim ulations in the Greenbook, which suggested that in order to hold the line on inflation the funds rate needs to rise another point. We probably still have som e time before we absolutely  have to act, m ainly because our credibility currently is so high, but I just don’t  see any particular reason to dela y. I doubt that it is going to get any easier to tighten policy and it m ight get a lot harder. There is one other point that  I consider quite im portant , which I think Larry Meyer mentioned. Even if you are right about productivity  growth continuing to accelerate, in that situa tion an incre ase in interes t rates is not ne cessarily inappropriate. We need to keep that in mind. If, as appears likely, we don’t raise rates to day but stay with “B” an d have an asymm etric 10/5/99 61 directive, I have a very strong preference for a nnouncing that. I would be  very concerned about trying to do that with language. I have the sam e feelings a lot of  other people have expressed, but perhaps I have those leanings even  more strongly. To m e it’s a m atter of credibility. If we don’t announce asymm etry, I’d probably pref er the third alternat ive--just saying we’v e changed the rules of the gam e. But when we first adopted the proce dure we’re now using we i ndicated that if we had a material change that would interest the m arkets, then we would announce it. To go back on that at this stage of the ga me would be a m istake.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. First, my students back at Michigan would be delighted to know that the term  “second deri vative” has crept into policy discussions. [Laughter] I com pliment you on that! On your criticism  of m odels, I’ll plead guilty to thinking for a long tim e in term s of matching aggregate demand with fixed or predictabl e levels of aggregate supply. There is nothing engraved on a stone tablet that sa ys that’s the way to do it. I believe you’re right that we ought to get out of th e box, if you will, and th ink about new ways to view the econ omy. I will try to do that. It’s possible that we are on the verge of som e kind of shift not onl y in econom ic outcom es, but also in the way of thinking about econom ics. That’s  a reasonable point to put on the table. In term s of more imm ediate policy considerations, I’m  not totally again st waiting to se e what happens. I would m ake two points. One is th at it is harder to raise the funds rate than to lower it. Secondly, in m y heart--even with what I just said about new wa ys of thinking about econom ics--I would be more comfortable with a hi gher funds rate than the one we have now, in case we’re wrong about the second de rivative issue. I make no bones about that. I’m delighted to see that there seem s to be a growing consensus that if we have to act, we could act in Nove mber. It’s im portant to get that on the tab le because I believe we m ight have to act in November. In term s of what we do today, I have a pr eferen ce for what I’ll call straig htforward asymm etry. I’ll give three reasons for that. The firs t is that these are the ru les that we agreed to live by and it’s not a good idea to  change the procedures until we ’ve gone through the process of considering various alternatives, which is a process we are going through. I don’t think that boxes us in. It has been pointed out statistically that as ymm etry has b een f ollowed by rate incre ases les s than half the tim e in the recent pa st. So I really d on’t accept th e argum ent that asymmetry boxes u s in. As a general m atter, I think we have a tend ency to try to do too m uch with language and I would prefer the m ore straightforw ard approach of “B” asymm etric. 10/5/99 62

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I agree with your recomm endation of “B” asymm etric. And I certainly agree w ith your stat ement that we should be hum ble about our ability to forecast the future. We’ve talked about th is, and it’s a co ncern th at nags us all. I do want to note two points about the forecast that I though t were worth m entioning to this group even though we have som e questions abou t the forecast.  But if we accept the Greenbook forecast as it is, I though t it was strik ing that, in the alternative scenarios th e staff presented, core CPI in 2000 varied by only 0.1 of a point, from 2.7 to 2.8 percent. There was virtually no difference in  any of the scenarios. It’s alm ost as if  that is bak ed in the cak e already in this f orecast. Of course, the output varies significantly. The second point is that if we adjust core CPI on a cons istent m ethodological basis going backward, that 2.7 percent forecas t for the year 2000 w ill be the highest rate of  increase in co re CPI since 1992 when it was 2.9 percent on that adjusted basis. So, those are two points that really concern m e as I look at this forecast. Of course, the forecast m ay be wrong, as we all know, but these are the points of concern. On the question of how to disclose this to  the public, I pa rticipated in the discussion yesterday with Roger Ferguson’s group and I describe d our effort as looking for the “least wors t” option am ong the three that you presen ted. None of them  is really satisfactory at this point. I do not think we should freeze the use of this tool  between now and the tim e the working group’s report com es out and we m ake a decision on what we’re  going to do. I have a slight preference for the recommendation you m ade for usi ng language instead of the tool itse lf at this point. We made a mistake when we adopted this procedure. I just rem ember the problem s we had when we used it last tim e. So I would have a slight preference for using language instead  of the actual tool of asymm etry. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, before  this m eetin g I favored “B” but concluded that the tim e for raising rates is probably not th at far off. As a result of th e discussion today, I think it’s even nearer but I still would favor alternative B. With regard to the symmetry issue, I must adm it that I found the experience we encountered--in term s of m arket re action to the May press release about asymm etry--so distasteful 10/5/99 63 that it m akes m e want to try to use words to de scribe our views about th e risks to the outlook. Clearly, we are not talking about a symm etrical situation. So I’d li ke to indicate a preference to use words to deal with this issue of risks to the outlo ok. But if we can’t do that in an efficient way, I certainly could buy an announcem ent of asymme try. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairm an, I truly enjoye d your lecture a m oment ago and when you publish it I recomm end t he title “The Rediscovery of  Say’s Law.” I think  it is im portant f or us to give Say’s L aw at least equal billing w ith Keynes’s Law in these discussions. During the go-around there was a lot of talk about favorable but tem porary factors that have helped us out on inflation and how a lot of t hose are petering out. That is true, but I still believe the f undam ental factor that has been helpi ng us is the high-tech boom , which is not petering out and is not likely to peter out any tim e soon. That’s the general phenom enon. And the specific phenom enon is the Internet, which is changing the whole world as we speak. When I refer to the high-tech boom , I’m  talking about high-tech elec tronics, which is helping the GDP numbers. But high-biotech is also raising our standard of living in ways that probably don’t im prove those numbers. It may even ha ve a perverse effect on the num bers. Cures of diseases, the prevention of diseases, and shorter hospital stays all m ay generate less GDP than diseases would. Another huge developm ent that is not over yet,  even though it has been going on for almost a decade, is the collapse of comm unism and hard core socialism  around the world. The fact is that many more countries and m any m ore workers are now part of the world m arket econom y than before. And even where it hasn’t involved a lowe ring of the iron curtain, there has been a lowering of the protectionist curtain--in La tin Am erica, for exam ple. So we  have a big, new, world out there with lots of new people. Ther e’s a lot of catching up to do, a lo t of consolidations are going on, and a lot of privatization. And there is still ex cess capacity in m any places around the world, including the United States. We’ve been adding to capacity f aster than w e’ve been u sing it. So I feel good about the prospects for further progress on inflation. I know that the current account de ficit is large and that we do n’t want to rely forever on capital inflows to augm ent dom estic savings. But if it is true that a strong c ountry leads to a strong currency, we are the prem ier country in this revolu tion. I think it’s not un reasonable to expect the dollar generally to rem ain strong and to continue to give us the benefits of a strong currency in our inflation b attle. 10/5/99 64 On the policy decision today, I suspect it’s no su rprise that I like the “B” alternative of no change. In my view we ’ve had three tightenings  already. The first was the announcem ent of the asymm etric directive, w hich probably did m ore ha rm to the markets than the two other tightening moves we’ve had. I do think we created a m onster with our new disclosure policy and the way we worded that policy. But it is still v ery new, and everybody--especially m arket particip ants--knows it’s not working well. So it would seem very reasonable to m e for us to announce that because it’s not working as we had expected, we are going to reassess it--we have form ed a subcommittee to reasse ss it-- and that un til tha t subco mmittee reports, we’re not going to be releasing any inform ation about the symmetry in the directive. I would go even  further and suggest that the Comm ittee decide to bu ry it later on . As Ed Boe hne said and I believe B ob Parry said, we can still use words to communicate anything we want. But if we could use the opportuni ty to get out of the box we’re in on announcing the directiv e, it would be a very good thing. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Between words or announcing the decision on asymmetry, which would you choose?  I’m trying to get a sens e of where everyone is to form ulate a proposal for the vote. You seem ed to im ply that of the th ree va riations, the least d esirab le is to  publish the asymm etry. A second option would be to have as ymmetry and not publish it, just use words to describe it. The first is what you’re opposed to? 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I’m for the third--to suspend our use and thus announcem ents of symmetry or asymm etry. I think it’s a tie between the first and the second options. I’ll go along with whatever yo u decide to do on that q uestion. But I think we will m iss a great oppo rtunity to g et rid of that bogeym an if we don’t do it now. It would be a great tim e to say this  is not working the way we intended and we’re going to study it. And a ll we have to announce today is no change in the target fed funds rate.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Touc hé! President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I liste ned to your argum ents with great interest, and they are very persuasive. At the sam e time, my own view is still that we should move the funds rate up ¼ point now. While I believe productiv ity is truly increasing, as I said earlier, I think there are o ther important im balances in the e conomy that, if  addressed no w, will resu lt in a be tter econom ic perform ance in the long term . We should  take advantage of that opportunity now. Also, to the ex tent that the pro ductiv ity in creases are positiv e in term s of the second deriv ative and are 10/5/99 65 continuing, we can act now to address som e of these other im balances and not affect those strong gains. We should keep that in m ind as we consider m onetary policy today. On the issue of symm etry, I personally would like to leave th e directiv e symmetric. My reason is that I don’t th ink there h as been a m ajor change in ou r attitud e. The las t two tim es we met, we increased rates. We’re obviously alert to  the possible need for m ore firm ing. We’re aware of it today. Because we don’t take an action tod ay doesn’t m ean we’re not as concerned as we have been, e specia lly as the data come out. However, if  asymm etric is the  way the Committee wishes to go, I think we’re in the stew here in term s of announcing. The law of unintended consequences has m anifest itself on this and we are som ewhat bound to announce how we are leaning, alth ough I will tell you that our orig inal announcem ent does not s ay that we’re necess arily going to disclose our decision on symmetry. But th at’s not what m any people read. So I think we’re com pelled in a way and I would have to su ggest that w e disclose our decision if we go asymm etric. But I think we’d be wise not to go asymmetric. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I, too, favor alternative B. Let me take just a few seconds to say why. First of all, as I said ea rlier this m orning, I am  relatively optim istic about productivity, and that gives m e some confidence  going forward. Secondly, that optimism  assuages some of m y concerns about inflat ionary pressures. I sim ply don’t think the case for a significant acceleration of inflation is all that  convincing at th is point. And third ly, I d o believ e we have a little tim e. We have m oved the funds rate up. The m arkets, especially long-term  markets, have moved rates up even m ore. I think we can wait to  see what all that brings. So, I favor “B.” On the symm etry versus asymm etry issue, norm ally I favor symm etry, a nd that’s true today. But it’s not a big deal to m e. If we go asymm etric, given the procedures we have set up, we have to say som ething about it. I would com e out a bout as Ned Gram lich did. Probably the least bad alternative u nder thes e circum stances  is jus t to publish it. Also, I think the m arkets--or som e participan ts in the m arket--a re probably expecting asymm etry. Several people have comm ented along those lines. And it’s probably not a bad idea to rem ind people that th e door is not closed as far as the N ovem ber m eeting of the Comm ittee is concern ed. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. As I listened to the go- around, I found m yself identifying with those w ho would have prefer red to go ahead and tighten today. But I am comfortable supporting “B” asymmetric , basically for three reasons. First of all, both in the context 10/5/99 66 of what we’ve talked about here today and also for a num ber of other reasons, I’m  delighted that the window still appears to be open for action in  Nove mber. Secondly, there is an abnorm ally strong flow of data that will be com ing in over the relativ ely brief period of tim e between now and our Novem ber meeting, and that should be of great benefit to us. Thirdly, how we do it is part of the reason for supporting “B,” in m y opinion. We talked about this yesterday in Roger Ferguson’s working group, and I am beginning to  feel--I don’t think I was alone in this view--that it could be very counterproductive if we did som ething in a ne w way today. It would be ad hoc. We haven’t really thought it through in term s of where we’re going or wh ere we want to wind up. But m ore importantly,  the m arket will not b e prepared for it at a ll. It would introdu ce an additio nal complication at a tim e when we don’t need an y additional com plications. It could induce considerable confusion, possibly vo latility, and u nfortunate s peculation. So I’d be very careful about doing som ething new and different that was a departure from  our past practices. I think that would be highly undesirable. The market is  only  now beginning to beco me a little m ore comfortable with the procedures we have recently adopted, and to  change them  on the fly scares me. What then d oes that call for? This is a change in the dire ctive and it repres ents a ch ange in the Comm ittee’s central thinking if, as I believe, we have a consensus for “B” asymmetric. And I think the m ost straightforward way to handle this  would be to adopt an asymmetric directive, announce it to the public, and append a br ief explanation to our statem ent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an. I, too, could have been enthusiastic about increasing the fed funds  rate by 25 basis points at this m eeting and going with a symm etric directive. That would have conveyed to the m arkets our concern about the potential for a pickup in inflation--recognizing all the problem s associated with forecasting--g iven the strength of the data and the unwinding of som e of the temporary factors.  And it would have cleared the decks, in m y view anyway, for year-end. That said, I can support “B” for some of the same reasons that Mi ke Kelley just noted. We question about productivity. I’ve sp ent a long time in the Federal Re serve System  associated with the operations side; and when m anagem ent gets  involved, it’s usually  around the issue of productivity changes from i mprovem ents in operations . In my view, anyway, those occur in step functions. We m ake a big change and consolidate for a while, reorganize, and get the benefits out 10/5/99 67 of the change and then go forward from  there. Not very routinely does productivity keep going up in a constant arc nor do we routinely get yea r-after-year continued positive second derivative changes. You m entioned yourself th at it will co me to an end som etime. We don’t know when. But we probably do have som e time, because p roductiv ity im provem ents seem  to have a mom entum  that is deeply engrained in the wa y the econom y is running right now. It’s also good that action in Nove mber continues to be a possibility. So I can support “B .” I also feel that if we start now to change  the process by which we communicate asymmetry --and I do think we should communicate how we feel about the ba lance of risks--the outcom e won’t be be neficial. It will in trodu ce anothe r level of surprise and unce rtainty into th e market. It discussed. But I’d ra ther stick with that langu age until we ha ve a f irm view on the way to go forward and can comm unicate that with som e confidence. So, I’d go along with Governors Gram lich and Kelley and others around the ta ble on “B” asymmetric, using the custom ary language. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairm an, I identify m ost closely with the comments Cathy Minehan just m ade and those of Ed Kelley and Ned Gra mlich earlier. In my earlie r comments, I indicated that I cam e into this m eeting with the  notion th at I would be com fortabl e with another modest tightening move today. Even after d iscounting o ur forecast and our genetic tend ency to worry--an d even factoring in your rem inder about productivity- -I think one could still m ake the case that another m odest tightening would perhaps be the cl eanest, m ost honest, m ost expeditious way to get policy to the appropriate place. But I can be co mfortable with no policy action today . As m y colleague across the tab le rem inded us last week, and as others have com mented, the world is not going to com e to an end between meetings--especi ally if we’re open to c onsidering a policy action again in Novem ber. I also cam e to the m eeting thinking that the wors t of all worl ds was som e kind of asymm etric directive. As Don Kohn first ticked  off the alternatives and then you ticked off the alternatives, I was think ing that if  there were a box labeled “none of the above” I would have checked it b ecause none of them  feels right. Having said that, and having listened to the discussion, I have changed my m ind a bit during the course of this session. My sense is that we see som e inflation risk, and I think we ought to go ahead and communicate that concern. I, too, am  uncomfortable  with the notion of 10/5/99 68 introducing still another way of tryi ng to convey that to the m arkets. As badly as we handled it the first tim e, I would rather try again very straightfo rwardly to see if we can get the word s right this time to explain an asym metric directive and be  done with it. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. This has been an in teresting discussion. I must adm it, as I said earlier, that I would have  preferred to go asymmetric and put out a press release but not announce our decision with regard  to the asymm etry. But I fi nd the argum ents in the other direction actually quite convincing. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCDONOUGH. So do I. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I am now inclined  to announce the asymm etry. The current members preferred that option by a 5 to 4 m argin, but if we include those who are not currently members of the Comm ittee, there is a very clear majority in favor of announcing the asymmetry. On an issue such as this, which comm its the Co mmittee in a broader sense, I believe we should take into consideration the views of the nonvoting m embers even if  that is not legally required. So what we will vote on at this point is “B” asymme tric with the understand ing that we will publish our decision. Would you read  the directive language? 

[SECTION]

MR. GILLUM. Yes, Mr.  Chairm an. I will b e reading from  page 13 of the Bluebook: “To prom ote the Comm ittee’s long-run ob jectives of price s tability a nd sustainable econom ic growth, the Comm ittee in th e imm ediate future seeks co nditions in r eserve m arkets consisten t with maintaining the federal funds rate at an averag e of around 5¼ percent. In view of the evidence curren tly av ailab le, the Comm ittee believ es that prospective developm ents are m ore likely to warrant an increase than a decrease in the fe deral funds rate operat ing objective during the interm eeting period.”

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. We h ave a draft statem ent, which I’d lik e to circulate so everyone can take a look at it instead of m y reading it. I can read it but I think it would be helpful for you to have the text in front of you. I’ll wait  until it’s dis tributed. [Pause] Does anybody have any comments? 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. I have a question about som ething that wasn’t raised in the discussion because I didn’t th ink ab out it un til after I listened to everybo dy. It may be too late to raise it for today but it m ay be useful for next tim e. Without in any way  prejudg ing whether th e Comm ittee would want to take an action in November, wh at would be the im plications of rem oving the asymm etry from  the directive in Novem ber?  Or does that m atter?  We could be in the situation we were in on June 30th where the action and the words seem ed to convey different m essages and w e got varying m arket responses. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. One of the things th at I’d like to ask of  the Ferguson working group is whether it can perhaps ex pedite its report if possible.  You had a long discussion--

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. We can do it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If you can report to the Comm ittee at the beginning of the could address that p articular i ssue so on because we’ve got to  reso lve it. While looking forward to that we’re struggling with this at each and ev ery m eeting. So the sooner we can come to a resolution, I suspect the better. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I think we can probably report by the next m eeting. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, given President McDonough’s earlier  comments and my own sense of this, is it necessary to spend so m uch tim e on the labor m arkets in this p ress re lease? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Strangely enough, as a consequence of President McDonough’s rem arks, I put in additional words he re to em phasize that the key question is inflation and its potential for underm ining the impressive perf ormance of t he econom y. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Right. But could we ta ke out the labor m arket reference? 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. We ought to be caref ul. There is a sense of causality here; this is what we’re worried about. I don’t s ee any reason to hide that. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Well, if we’re going to do that, ther e are a lo t of other thin gs I’d like to  list. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. I had the sam e reaction. It seem s awfully limiting to hang  all of our hats on one item . 10/5/99 70 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. The point here, it seem s to m e, is that the m ore seriou s pro blem  is in th e realization of above-trend growth in the form  of high utilization rates. Do you want to m ention what brought about the high ut ilization rates? This cap tures it pretty well. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. I’m not convinced. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. One m ore comm ent. People conti nue to pound m e with the question: What is it that you’re looking at?  The way this is worde d, it ess entially tells peo ple to watch  that one statistic and that one part of the econom y, and wh ether that behaves or m isbehaves will guide our action s. I think it’s m ore com plicate d than tha t. I wouldn’t want to lim it ourselves by having that appear to be the only thing that wi ll trigger a tightening m ove later on. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Well, what we can do is  to say that we need to be especially alert in the months ahead to pot ential cost incr eases tha t could lead to inf lation p ressures. 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL. I like tha t. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I disagree with that. Take a situation where we have cos t increas es and  a 0.2 or 0.3 percentage point decline in the unem ploym ent rate next tim e. I know where I’m  going to be. If everybody else isn’ t there, that’s fine. Are preem ptive responses by us to changes in the balance of supply and dem and appropriate even befo re those cost pressures show up?  That’s the question. If you’re not prepared to respond to that-­

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. But if we say “potential” for cost increases, that gets to your point, I think. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. That’s fine. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I don’t want to vote next tim e for a tightening of m onetary policy because the unem ploym ent rate went down. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Neither do I. 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER( ?). You don’t have to! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. My colleague s won’t want to either. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. It’s hard to re-edit a statem ent 55 m inutes before press tim e, but I think a good way out of this is to drop the w ord “labor” in front of costs. Labor co sts are the biggest part of costs, but I don’t think we need to single it out. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Why don’t we do this: “In these circum stances, the Federal Open Marke t Comm ittee will need to  be espec ially alert in the  months ahe ad to the po tentia l for cost increases significantly  in excess of productivity in a m anner that could contribu te to inflation pressures and underm ine the im pressi ve perform ance of the econom y.” 10/5/99 71 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. That’s fine. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH. For Larry Meyer’s pe ace of m ind, we do discuss above the decrease in the pool of available workers. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I’m happy! 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, it seem s to m e that the m ost low-key way of doing this would simply be to take the first paragraph plus the la st paragraph of the draft press release without the first three w ords. That would be a sim ple statem ent about what was done--period. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. That says what we did but not w hy we did it. It goes against the notion that an announcem ent is supposed to give the rationale for what we’re doing. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. And it would be a departur e from  what we ’ve done for the last few meetings. 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL. That’s right. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. I’m okay with the la test changes. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Adjust it as the Chairman said and declare victory! 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Let’s quickly adjourn! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. For e verybody’s benef it, I am  not of the o pinion th at writing a press release by comm ittee is the most productive way of doing it, but this is a crucial one. Let me just rere ad it to be su re tha t everyone f eels comfortable. “The Federal Open Marke t Comm ittee “Strengthening productivity growth has been fo stering favorable trends in unit costs and prices, and much recent inform ation suggests that these trend s have been sustain ed. Nonetheless, the growth in dem and ha s continu ed to outpace th at of supply,  as eviden ced by a decrease in the pool of available workers willing to take jobs.” We’re not saying that’s the cause of it; th at’s merely a m easure of  it. “In thes e circumstances , the Feder al Open Marke t Comm ittee will need to be especially alert in the m onths ahead to the pote ntial for co st inc reases signif icantly in excess of productivity in a m anner that could contribute to inflation pressures and underm ine the im pressive perform ance of the econom y.” Okay? 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?). That’s fine! 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Yes, sir. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Why don’t we just toss these copi es in the m iddle of the table and get fresh ones? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. You read “cost increases signific antly” rather than “costs to increase”? 10/5/99 72 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Yes, he took out “costs to increase.” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. “The potenti al for cost in creas es.” Plural.

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Then “in a m anner” doesn’t work. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. You want to ta ke out the referen ce to pro ductiv ity? 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL( ?). No, no. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Fix it up, Don! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Okay, fine. Sold! Our next meeting is Novem ber 16th. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. One rem inder, Mr. Chairm an. The Comm ittee in its m ail-in ballo t, voted -­including the nonvoting Presidents th e vote was 10 to 3, I think--to ch ange the order of the lead-in paragraph in the directive so that  the inflation sen tence is firs t. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Yes, I forgot to m ention that. The very su bstantial m ajority agreed with Presiden t Poole on m oving the sen tence. Are yo u all f amiliar with what I’m  referring to? The only question on the table is not whether we want to do it but if we should do it now or as part of the F erguson report. I would prefer to wait. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I would prefer to wait, too. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. I do, too. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I think we should ad just all those things at once. 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL. Let’s do it all at one time. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Let’s wait and do it then. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. So we’ll go with the old one?

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, we’re done! Let’s go to lunch.
