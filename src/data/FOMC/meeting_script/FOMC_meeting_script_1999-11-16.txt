[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I will be referring  to the usu al set of charts and s ome additio nal m aterials that s hould be on the table in front of you. 1/ As usual, the top chart in the package shows the current 3-m onth deposit rates im plied by traded f orward rate agr eements. Looking at the top panel of the first chart, y ou can see that in the Unite d States forward rates continued to back up after your last m eeting and peaked w ith the release of the CPI on October 19th. They have b een declinin g since then,  particula rly on the re lease of third-qu arter GDP data and the ECI. Thus, 3-m onth expe cted rates for m ost of next year are now at the sam e levels as they were just prio r to the Comm ittee’s m eeting  in In Europe, forward rates have roughly the sam e pattern, but m oved up to twin peaks on the release of our CPI a nd the release of Euro area M3 data on rate increase on Nove mber 4th by the ECB, expected 3-m onth rates in Europe for next year are now at the sam e levels as in early O ctober. It seem s to m e that what has happened in Europe is that one or tw o rate in creas es that for som e time had been expected to occur in the first half  of next year have been brought forward into November of this year and nothing else has changed. In Japan, despite interest in politic al circles in Bank of Japan policy meetings, you can see from the bottom panel that forward rate expectations took quite little notice of those m eetings. However, there has been an updrift in the current LIB OR 3-month rate, the black line in  that panel. This appears to reflect some increased tiering in yen m oney markets of the type we have seen in past years but it is not yet anywhere nearly as severe. It also suggests, as I understand from  our traders, som e shifting back a nd forth in views about who will an d who won’t be lending m oney over the end of the year, causing ch anges in expe cted rates f or the turn of the year in Japan. Turning to the second page, the top pane l shows 10-year yields in the United States, the U nited Kingdom , and Germ any. On the left side--the little numbers 1/ A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Fish er is appended to the transcript. 11/16/99 2 there are bas is points--are the 2- to 10-year spreads on July 1st and on the right side are the 2- to 10-year sp reads as of last Fr iday. What I enjoy about this chart in par ticular, as it relates to what is of interest to m e, is how  little I understand about what’s going on here. Germ an and ot her Continental yields began to rally just ahead of, but through th e releas e of Euro area M3 data, which to all observers were higher than expected. But the b ond m arkets took off on a nice rally that continued w ith the release of our GDP data and then continued through the 50 basis point ECB rate increase. Now, this  has been explained different ways in Europe. Most have focused on the idea that uncertainty about near-term  ECB intentions has been removed and a rela ted perception that the ECB is now on hold. Another theory is that the ECB has gained credib ility b y being pre -emptive and is now ahead of the curve. The f irst th eory uncomfortab ly sugg ests to m e that the un certainty p remia for anticipated central bank actio ns have a larg er pos itive basis p oint im pact on long-term rates than does an actual central ba nk rate increase. For the second argum ent about credibility to hold wa ter, Europe would have to be m ore sensitive to short-term rates th an to long -term , because ot herwise th e decline in long-term  yields would underm ine the restraining influence of  short-term  rates. But throughout m y career and through current events, my colleag ues in Europe have always told m e that Europ e is m ore sensitiv e to long -term  rates than those s illy Anglo Saxon econom ies that are so focused on short-term  rates. So, I am  not quite sure how the credibility argum ent plays here either. Looking at the United Kingdom , it’s intri guing how the 10-year gilt yield has these countries are at very different points  in the econom ic cycle. To draw a point on it, the 2- to 10-year spread in the UK is  inverted to the tune of 85 basis points while the Germ an spread, as you can see, is positive from  2- to 10-years in the amount of 115 basis points. Notwiths tanding the econom ies being at different points in the cycle, these yi elds are m arching along rather in lock step. Maybe the rally in gilts is what is pu lling Continental yields lower. Looking at U.S. yields, I’d just note that  with 2- to 10-year spreads having narrowed from  26 basis points on July 1st to 15 basis points last Friday--and I think to 12 basis points this m orning--one  might understand that there are few if any voices in our bond m arket who are prep ared to join the “bubble-ologists” in proclaim ing that the Fed is behind the curve. Looking down the page, the next three pane ls depict yield spreads of various instrum ents over U.S. Treasuries. In the first of these three panels you can see that the em erging m arket index spreads to U.S. Treasuries have been narrowing consistently since last summer’s highs; and they have narrowed by an additional 150 basis points since the Oct ober release of the CPI. In the next panel you can see that the spread of th e Merrill Lynch high yield index, or junk bond index, to Treasuries h as been relatively s table but  has widened recen tly, moving in just the 11/16/99 3 opposite direction of the em erging market sp reads. Market talk is focused on an explicit shift of funds out of U.S. high-yield instru ments into em erging market high-yield instrum ents and also on increas ed sensitivity to r ising def ault rates in domestic high-yield m arkets. Finally, in the last panel you can see that spreads on 10-year swaps and the F annie Mae b enchm ark have com e off their recent highs of last summ er and returned m ore or less to  the levels of early July. And corporate spreads a re off their hig hs, but are st ill just a tad wider than in July. Turning to the third page and year-end funding m arkets, this chart shows the three com ponents of the cu rrent butterfly. That is , it depicts the Nove mber, the Decem ber contract from  late October to mid-Novem ber has been noticeable. That seem s to reflect at least a couple of  things com ing together. First, in an exaggerated way the Decem ber contract follows the sam e pattern as the expecta tions  for rate a ction by the Comm ittee, p articula rly following th e release of the GDP and ECI data. However, it also  seem ed to get qu ite an im pact from our third round of auctions of options on Nove mber 3rd and particularly from  our announcem ent on November 4th that the Desk would hold four m ore rather than only two m ore auctions. Turning to the next page, let m e go ove r the d etails of each of the auc tions we’ve held. The vertical colum ns give you for each of the th ree strips the actual auction am ounts, the total propositions, the bid-to-cover ratio, the awards we gave out or the stop-out rates on a Dutch auc tion, and the high and low bids. Having told the dealers we would try to m eet de mand for these op tions, we f elt a n eed to respond to the high bid-to-cover ratios of the first two auctions. In all cases these were at rather elevated leve ls: 4 to 1, 4.7 to 1, 6.4 to 1, etc. So we raised the amount sharply for the third auction, doub ling the am ounts for both the turn of the year strip and for the January strip. While the bid-to-cover ratio cam e down in the third auction, the stop-out rates and thus the Dutch awards cam e in quite high. You can see that in the awards colu mn in the third entry in each  panel: 11 basis points, 16 basis points, and 11.5 basis points. So, after the third au ction we left the amount for the turn of the year strip constant at $50 billion but raised the am ounts for the surrounding strips. We also announced that we w ould hold at least four more auctions for a total of seve n, rathe r than just two m ore for a total of five. We think this helped calm  the dealers and their cus tomers considerably, as reflected both in th e Decem ber LIBOR contract and in th e much reduced stop-out rates for the fourth auction. We’ve reduced the am ounts for the fifth auction to be held to morrow for each of the three strips to $15, $30, and $20 billion and, obviously, we will see how the subsequent au ctions go. 11/16/99 4 Looking forward, as I’ve m entioned previously, I would consider this operation a com plete success if none of  these options is exercised. The motivating p rinciple still seem s valid to m e that th e more we sell, the le ss likely it is tha t they will be ex ercised. But there st ill is a  risk th at the y will be ex ercis ed. If relatively sm all amounts are exercised on any one day for reasons specific to an individu al firm --its own funding position or  its o wn collectio n of collateral--we should be able to drain sufficient reserves  to m anage the im pact on the funds rate that day through our own m atched-sales operations. But if all, or even substantial amounts, are exercised on any day it is harder to anticipate the im pact on the funds rate. Any shock sufficient to cause a large-scale exercise of these options can also be expected to have a profound im pact on th e funds rate and on other short-term  market interest rates. So, it is  hard to know in adva nce with any clarity what it is we would be doing vis-à-vis that day’s funds rate. In any event, if such an exogenous shock were to happen, we woul d likely be trying to drain reserves not to m anage that day’s funds rate, but to try to moderate the im pact on cumulative excess reserves for the period--the impact over the rest of the period. But that is obviously som ething we’ll have  to decide on a case-by-case basis. Turning to the next page and our m ore traditional open m arket operations, the top pan el depicts various forecas t scenarios in volving a cu mulative res erve drain from  currency in circulation. Reserve needs have continued to grow recen tly--ref lecting, it seem s to us, typical season al growth in curren cy in circulation and the strong dem and from  banks for increased vault cash in anticipation of Y2K-relate d dem ands of the public. Shown in the bottom  dotted line of  this p anel is the N ew York sta ff’s previous “low” projection for currency in circula tion. We calle d that a b ase-case s cenario in which we im agined there would be no Y2K i mpact. The higher dash ed line is what we called a “hig h” forecast--not a worst cas e scenario b ut just a stro ng Y2K effect. The two solid lines reflect how we’ve revised up bo th of those forecas ts because the actual levels have com e in m ore or less right on track with our high, but not worst case, forecast. So, we’ve rev ised up our low forecast for currency  by alm ost $20 billion for the turn of the year, based on the experience we’ve seen through m id-In the bottom panel is a chart depicting the pricing of our long-term  RPs. Let me give you a little background on that before I describe the chart. We have conducted five long-term tri-party RPs th at run through the turn of the year, totaling about $27 billion. We have done more than 20 overnight and short-term tri-party RPs. In each o f these RPs we have sep arately priced U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt, and m ortgage-backed  collateral and h ave carefully tried to maintain a c onsisten t relationsh ip between  our sense of current m arket rates for each type of  collateral and our stop-out ra tes, co nsciously ch oosing not to violate the existing spreads. What is depicted in this chart is the cum ulative p roposition s we’ve receiv ed on all five of these long-term --through the ye ar-end--RPs. The vertical axis is the 11/16/99 5 dollar value expressed in millions ; therefore, th e top am ount is $55 billion  of collateral proposition s. Across the h orizon tal axis is the d eviation of the rates given us fro m our sense of where m arket rates were for each type of collateral. So, the lower left corner represents 4 basis points above where we think market rates are and , moving across that axis , the progression goes to 44 basis points below our sense of m arket rates. In the table at the bo ttom is listed the collateral we accepted--about $1 3.7 billion of Treasuries, $2.2 billion of ag ency debt, and $10.5 billion of m ortgage-backed collateral. On av erage, ou r stop- out rate has been about 4 basis points below our sense of where m arket rates were . Now, som e observers in the m arkets have been disturbed about the quantity of  Treasu ry collateral we have taken off the m arket--$13 billion--through our year-e nd operations. I felt pretty strongly that we should not be disturbing the exis ting spread relationships unless we m ade a very conscious decision to do that. So we have been trying to take collateral as the dealers have priced it. And the fact  of the m atter is that the dealers have shown us very lack luster--and th ey will concede g reedy--pricing, particularly on agency debt and to som e extent on m ortga ge-backed collateral. They have been more aggres sive in p ricing the Trea sury collate ral to us. We will con tinue to be disciplined about this. At som e point th e tim e may com e when in order to calm widening spreads we m ight intentiona lly change our behavior and take disproportionate am ounts of agency and m ortgage-backed collateral. My sense at this point is that we woul d probably do that by simply re verting to one pricing. In that c ase the three types of  collate ral w ould all be given to us in one set of propositions, which would autom atically adva ntage the higher yielding collateral. But so far we’ve taken the spreads as we have found them  rather than taking on the job of setting the spreads ourselves. Finally, on the last page you can see that in the period since your last meeting the fed funds rate has traded sli ghtly on the soft side except in the last couple of days, even though da ily volatility has been relatively contained. For m y taste, there appear to be too m any unsa tisfying explanations for this softness rather than any single persuasive one. Many have focused on our novel long-term operations and the general perception th at we will be generous about year-end funding, but that doesn’t quite get me fa r enough to explain the softness in the first two m aintenance periods. In the last couple of days funds have been quite firm , and yesterday we had an elevated effective rate of 5.6 percen t, even though we had $10 billion of excess reserves on the day. But yesterday was quite an extraordinary day. We had a Treasury refunding, a m inor corporate tax date, som e security problem s at Bank of New York that delayed the close of the securities wire, and moves of 1/16th or 1/8th or so in  the m arket in antic ipatio n of Committee action today. All tho se factors contributed to a ra ther elevated rate yesterday. And the hangover f rom yesterday is with us today as the funds  rate is trading at 5½ percent. 11/16/99 6 Mr. Chairm an, we had no foreign exch ange intervention operations during the period. I will need th e Comm ittee’s ra tification of our dom estic open m arket operations and, of course, I’ll be happy to answer any questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Would you give us a hypothetical scenario of what would happen if a very substantial num ber of these options w ere exercised on a single day, triggered obviously by som e bank?  How would you arrange to m eet that?  What would you do? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. They would give us notice of  exercise. We would then do RPs with them  through the tri-party vehicle. Anyone w ho exercised an option would have to deliver collateral to the custody banks. And we would then  be putting out the funds to them  through the custody banks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. And the am ounts we  are likely to be dealing with are well within your capacity, as  best you can judge? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes. On the reserve adding side , we have looked at this to m ake sure we have the capacity to d o it. We are still r eviewing it but we think we  can handle th e exercis e of the options with no problem s. The question is  going to be how m any m atched sales we can do if we want to drain all the rese rves b ack out again. We are wo rking on that. There is a lim it on our bill portfolio. Our traditional m eans of doing th is is jus t against b ills; we are m ostly geared up to do m atched sales against bills, which involve  easier pricing than agai nst coupon securities. That is one issue we are looking into. We are also looking into whether we can do m atched sales or reverse repos through the tri-party agents, as I mentioned at previous meetings. There are operational issues that are throwing som e sand in to the gears--which we had a faint fear of before--causing us concern as to whether that will actually work. The bigger  constraint, I feel, is whether we could do as much as  $150 billion or $200 billion of m atched sales to drain out the reserv es we’ve put in. But I th ink it is possibl e that we will b e able to drain am ounts of around $100 or $125 billion or m aybe even $150 billion. It will be a com plicated operational exercise to do it. But w e think the capability is there on bot h sides. The quantity of the reserves to be drained back out is the issue, not the exerc ise of  the repos in the f irst instance. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. I assum e that in  the turm oil of  that sort of m arket the issu e of drain ing the reserv es is not all that im mediately urgent. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Absolutely. That is just what I m eant by m y rem arks that our focus will really be on th e impact on the cum ulative  averag e of excess reserves in the p eriod. As to whether we will actu ally d rain th em all out th at one day, I doubt it. But we will try to if what 11/16/99 7 is involved is the sort of exogenous shock that you are im agining. That is just what I m eant. We would not be pretending that we know where the funds rate should be tr ading or that we are trying to target it. Now, to get the scaling right, it’s importan t to ke ep in m ind that the tota l balance s traded in the funds m arket run about $15 to $25 b illion daily; $25 billion is m ore likely at year-end. Who knows what the upper range of the repo  market is? But $600 billion and up is the turnover in the repo m arket, so the scale there is quite extraordinary. It is possible that once we announce significant exercise of these options, the fe d funds  traders will r ealize the rate is going to go to zero  regard less o f any exogenous shock. That is, we will sm other whatever p ricing up for fear m ay be there. That is going to be in the m inds of the fed funds traders and the bank treasu rers and it is v ery hard to an ticipate. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Othe r questions for Peter? 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Just continuing this line of c onversation: If a lot of funds go into the then I assume that reduces the pr obability of any furthe r options being exercise d later on. So in a sense it is a one-tim e hit. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. That is a likely scenario. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. To m ake sure that my unders tanding is correct, I had a question about currency. My understanding is that currency outsid e the banking system  is growing at a very norm al rate. We do not see any par ticular increase in the hand-to-ha nd circulation as yet. Is that your sense? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Currency in circulation in cludes the currency in bank vaults? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. It is the vault cash that clearly has exhibi ted an extraordinary buildup. As for the rest, we think of it as  a slightly stronger than usual seasonal im pact but still in the range of the norm al seasonal increase. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. But not much m ore. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Money stock currency has b een growing at 9, 10, 11 percent. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. As it has been earlier? 11/16/99 8 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. It is in line with  the rate at which it has been  growing all year and it is comparable to the rate of  growth last year. So there does not seem  to be much, if anything, going on there. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Other questions for Peter? If not, we need a m otion to approve the dom estic transactions. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Move approval of the dom estic operations, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objectio n, they are approved. Let’s m ove on to Mike Prell. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Mr. Chairm an, Karen Johnson is going to lead off our re marks, but let me just m ention to the C ommittee that we rel eased industrial production data this m orning--I trust a few m inutes ago. We failed to put a copy of  the release in front of you, so let m e just tell you about it. There were som e small net revisions to the data for August and Septem ber that left And the October increase in i ndustrial production was 0.7 percent.  In m anufacturing we had a 0.1 percent increase in S eptem ber, also an upwar d revision, and 0.6 percent in October. I think these num bers are significantly above m arket expectations, so perhaps those of you with electronic gadgets can see whether ther e has been any m arket reaction. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I just looked and the tape is delayed. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I’m not sure whether that’s good news or not. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. The reaction is delayed? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. This gadget is ve ry slow. [Laughter] Let’s turn now to Karen Johnson. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. The ne ws about the globa l econo my that we have received over the interm eeting period has generally been quite favorable. The signs of streng thenin g activ ity, p articula rly in Asia, tha t we saw earlier in the yea r continue to be confirm ed, and positive de velopm ents in real output growth now appear to be widespread across other re gions of the globe as well, includ ing importantly the othe r industrial coun tries.  Taking into account what production data we have so far for the third quart er, along with indicators for the rem ainder of the year such as orders figures an d confidence m easures, we have revised up our estim ate for total output growth in th e rest of the world during the second half of this year f rom about 3¼ percent in Septem ber to 4 percent in the current Greenbook. 11/16/99 9 In updating our forecast,  we had to wr estle with the im plications for 2000 and 2001 of these signs of m ore robust activity abroad. Embedded in them  likely is som e boost from  transitory p recautionary dem ands reflectin g Y2K concerns on the part of households and firm s abr oad. Present also, at least for som e countries, is the spurt of activity that can com e in the initial phase of a cyclical rebound as a result of swings in inventories, the rel ease of pent-up dem and, and the stimulus of favorable financial conditions. Some moderation from  the initially very high growth rates is norm al under these circum stances. More fundam entally, som e of the robust indicators we are now seeing no doubt signal strength in underlying demand. Moreover, to the extent that confidence is bolstered by the current strong growth, dem and m ay expand further in the future. We have balanced these factors by revi sing up the near-term  level of foreign output to reflect the positiv e indicators of the past several weeks, but we are projecting only very slightly higher gr owth than in the previous Greenbook on average ov er the rem ainder of the forecas t perio d. As a consequence, th e level of foreign activ ity is h igher throughout this fo recast than in September. The near-term upward adjustm ents are spread throughout the industrial and developing countries in the forecast.  The sm all upwar d changes we have m ade to growth in 2000 and 2001 are notably in China and Me xico am ong the developing countries and in Japan and Canada am ong the industrial countries. With the dollar s till pro jected to d epreciate som ewhat in re al term s over the forecast period, we are looking for a rebound in the growth of real exports of goods and services from the low rates e xperienced in 1998 and the first half of this year. The upward revision we have m ade to projected foreign activity im plies a rebound in exports that is just a touc h stronger than what we expected in There is clearly a risk that thes e recen t indicators of strength are not the result of transitory or cyclical f actors. In that cas e, we ar e probably being too cautious in not ex trapolating m ore of the recen t good news from  abroad into our forecast for foreign activity and f or U.S. export growth over the next two years. To get a handle on the m agnitude of the effect of  a possible m iss on our part, we included in the Greenbook a sim ulation of the im plication for U.S. real GDP growt h of expansion abroad that is 1 percentage poi nt stronger at an annual rate, sustained over the com ing eight quarters,  than what we have in the baseline. Such an extrem ely buoyant outlook for foreign activ ity w ould raise projected U.S. real GDP growth by about ¼ percentage poin t in 2000 and ¾ percentage point in 2001. At the sam e time, it would raise the rate of U.S. core inflation by nearly ½ percentage point in 2001. Of course, even the cautiously optim istic outcom e in the Greenbook baseline forecast is n ot assured. Considerab le un certain ty rem ains in the foreign outlook. Among the most im portant unfavorable risk elem ents are: renewed weakness in Japan, perhaps as a consequence of withdraw al of fiscal stimulu s; a prem ature end 11/16/99 10 to the expansion in the euro area should tightening by the ECB prove excessive and/or confidence falter; and additional upward pressure on world oil prices from further OPEC production restraint or severe winter weather. Alterna tively, the r isk of a greater downward m ove in  the value of the dollar than we are projecting, either by itself or  in conjunction with pressures on other U.S. asset prices, cannot be ruled out. Such an exchange rate change would stimulate export dem and m ore and result in additional upward pressure on im port prices. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I think it’s pretty clear that, ev en gauge d with o ur re- calibra ted GDP ther mometer, the econom y has continued to  run hot in recent m onths. The bigger issue right now would seem  to be whether its tem perature has reached the inflation ary flash point. The recen t indicat ions h ave been m ixed on that s core, but as you know, we aren’t very optim istic. W e see underlying price trends m oving in an inflationary direction, even as dem and growt h slows a bit from  the recent pace. In that regard, we noted in the Green book that there have been som e signs of moderation in the expansion of household spending since m idyear. However, the news received in recent days has taken a b it of the edge off those signs. Friday’s report on October retail sales showed a 0.4 pe rcent gain at the so-called “control” category of stores. That isn’t an especia lly large gain, but it’s m ore than the chain store figures and anecdotal news had le d us to expect. And what m akes the surprise still m ore disquieting is the f act that the early results of the Michigan SRC survey point to a co nsiderab le resurgence in sentim ent this m onth. Of course, PCE is not the only com ponent of dom estic spending for which ongoing m oderation is less than assured. In the housing m arket, the rise in interest rates  this ye ar ap pears f inally to have taken som e of the wind out of builders’ sails. However, with cons umer confide nce seem ingly so strong and mortgage rates having slipped back som e in recent weeks, we’ll have to keep a close watch on the indicators of demand in th is sector as well. As it is, continuing reports that short supplies of inputs ha ve been delaying projects suggest that actual construction spending m ay hold up fairly well for a while. On the business investm ent side, apart from  our reading of the zig-zags in computer shipm ents as supporting our notion of a near-term  Y2K lock-down effect, there are no com pelling signs that the strong uptrend in spending on capital equipm ent is weakening . Meanwhile, yest erday’s retail inventory figures left the overall stock picture for the third quarter a bout as we anticipated  it--lean, and ripe for som e greater buildup in the near te rm, perhaps even apart from  any Y2K hedging. The bottom  line is tha t it’s f ar from certa in tha t we’re on tra ck for the substantial d eceleration of dom estic demand needed to offset the oncom ing extern al im petus Karen d escrib ed and  thereby avoid a further escalation of  labor 11/16/99 11 points of funds rate tightening over the next year and, im portantly, a plateau in share prices. The renew ed exuberance of the stock m arket this m onth seem s to underscore the upside risks to dem and com ing fr om that realm. One m ight argue that such upside dem and risks are of little concern because they in effect m irror an u pside risk to  aggregate supply in our forecast. As you know, looking at the p atterns in the re vised natio nal incom e accounts, we’ve found grounds for upgrading the structural gains in labor pr oductivity in the period ahead. It is, of course, possibl e that we didn’t go far enough. It might even be ass erted that the unanticipated strength of the stock market, especially with its focus in the tech sector, is an indication that we’re still lagging beyond the reality of the inform ation re volution. I’ll adm it to rem aining more than a little skeptical that the m arket is providing an inf ormed, rational a ssessment of  the prospects in this r egard. But, in any e vent, as we attem pted to  illus trate with a model sim ulation in the Greenbook, it would take a m uch greater im provem ent in productivity perform ance than we’ve allo wed for to avert a deterioration in inflation trends. Another way we m ight avoid that de terioration would be for 4 percent unem ployment to prove sustainable without putting pressure on real wage increases. A look at som e of the data we ’ve received in rece nt weeks could easily tempt one toward that conclusion. Certainly, the third-quarter ECI and October average hourly earnings figures were beni gn. Even the rather large, 4¾ percent annual rate, rise in nonfarm  com pensation per hour in the third quarter did not interrupt the broader decele ration since last year. But these observations don’t provide m uch comfort with respect to th e outlook if one buys our explanation for the slowing in nom inal wage increases--nam ely, last y ear’s p articula rly low price inflation, since reversed. Moreover, anecdotal indications of wa ge behavior have been less than propitious. While the picture is far from  unifor m, what I hear is that coping with a tight supply of qualified workers has becom e a preoccupation for m any managers; that short-staffing is creati ng strains, with excessive pressure on workers and som etimes quality problem s as a consequence; and that m ore employers are conc ludin g that they will have to break down and rais e wages by more or on a broader front. Of course, th ese s tories aren ’t entirely new, and m y percep tion that they ’ve becom e more common and intense may be colored by m y analytical priors. So you ’ll certainly want to ch eck them  against your ow n impressions. Switching gears, however, a nd looking directly at prices for the signs of mounting inflationary pressure, the da ta again are m ixed. Awkwardly, the expecting that both the total and core i ndexes will post increases on the order of a quarter percent--som ething that would not alter s ignificantly the recen t trends in 11/16/99 12 either m easure. One question is which measure to  regard as most inform ative about the prospective trends, and I’ll repe at the thought I conveyed at the last meeting that we should not focus enti rely on the more subdued core index. People and firm s do buy energy products, and th e rise in oil prices this year is likely to leave its m ark on wages and core prices going forward. In this regard, the spurt in crude prices in the past  few days is scarcely good news. But there are other indications as we ll that inflationary forces m ay be intensifying. The prices of non-oil imports have continued to rise, and this probably has contributed to the further not iceab le increas e in the core crude and interm ediate PPIs. Manufacturers of fina l goods and retailers still com plain that they lack pricing leverage, but these deve lopm ents in the pipeline would seem  to heighten the likelihood of at l east som e up-drift in inflation. Broadening the perspective a bit, I m ight say a few words about inflation in assets --a po pular them e in som e circles th ese days. I won’t return to the m atter of the stock m arket; nor will I talk about wh at has been happening in the rarified world of the art auction houses. Rather, I’ll focus on the house s we live in. The latest num bers for house prices--the F reddie Mac repeat sales index and the Census constant quality new hom e inde x--show accelerated increases of about 6 percent over the past year. It isn’t at all obvious that this is a reflection of increased inflation expectat ions; indeed, judging by the responses to the Michigan SRC survey, people haven’t been buy ing becaus e they view h omes as an especially good investm ent. In the m ain, I think we’re sim ply seeing the kind of relative price m ovement that occurs in a market where dem and, driven by strong gains in jobs, incom e, and stock m arket wealth, is pressing on what is an inelastic short-run supply of land, la bor, and m aterials. But, even if these price increas es do n’t reflect heightened inflationary expectations per se, they’re not irrelevant to the outl ook. It is likely that the higher house prices will show through at  som e point in the C PI through higher owners’ equivalent rents. And the price in creases  can them selves contribu te to an inflationary psychology. Certainly, rising prices on reproducible assets like houses tend to spur m ore investm ent activity  in the future and add to the general strength of dem and--as m ay the increases in wealth enjoyed by the owners of the assets. As I’ve noted, th is is not an econom y in need of m ore positiv e wealth effects on dem and. This brings m e to a final observation. There has also been a lot of discussion recen tly abo ut the intern al and ex ternal sav ing imbalances in the econo my. The NIPA revisions shuffled things around a bit, but the basic contours rem ain the same: The personal saving rate has plumm eted in this de cade; the p rivate saving-investm ent balance has swung sharply into  the negative, the counterpart being a considerable run-up in business and hous ehold debt that m ight som eday prove burdensom e; and we’ve opened up a big cu rrent account deficit, m irrored in a rapid growth of external  liabilities th at might weigh on the dollar. 11/16/99 13 These patterns reflect a com plex set of  forces, one that I fear is beyond the state of  the a rt to so rt out. But it s eems likely that part of the story is the “crowding in” of private investm ent by th e shift in the federal budget, som e of which has b een stru ctural. Another elem ent undoubtedly is the recen t slump in emerging market econo mies and the attracti on of the United States and U.S. dollar assets as a safe haven. Probably the cen tral question for you is  to what extent these so -called “im balances” are reflectiv e of an unsustain able cyclical bo om fostered by excessiv e financial ease. This, of course, just brings us back to the sam e fundam ental issues I was discussing earlier. In essence, the ex post saving-investm ent balances don’t seem to add m uch to the p icture; they sim ply provide a different vantage point on the matter before you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions? 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Mike, you m entioned oil prices spiking. When I was reading the Greenbook, I was struck by the fact that in the ve ry week in which oil prices were spiking, you were writing  down a forecast that has the price go ing back do wn by $5 a barrel, 25 percent o r so. Oil prices are am ong the m any things that I have absolutely no confidence in m y ability to predict, so I will go with your forecas t. But I am  curious abo ut how sensitive you r inflation outlook is to that, because ther e are a lot of volatil e personalities who still have powerful position s in places in the world that p roduce oi l. So, who can predic t what will h appen? Suppose we just draw a straight line and assum e that for the next two years, the forecast horizon, oil prices rem ain the sam e as they are toda y. What would be the im plications of that? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. That is a good question and one to which I do not have a precise answer. We do not anticipate a plumm eting in oi l prices ; we h ave a gradu al decline over the two years. The level clearly has m oved up since we established our assum ption; oil prices rose after the Greenbook was published. There is still a downward tilt in the futures m arkets, though next several months. But if the prices were to remain where they are no w, it would add at least a little to the core inflation rate, particularly in 2001. I do not thi nk it would create a night-and-day difference in the inflation outlook. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. President Jordan, based on our m odel, $5 a barrel more on oil prices ov er the forecast h orizon would add r oughly ¼ percen tage point to consum er price inflation in the next two years. 11/16/99 14 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Other questions? 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Karen, you m ade the point that econom ic prospects in the United States are certainly affected by the im proved situati on in foreign countries. I wonder if you would comment briefly about how your views have changed on Japan. It seem s to m e that the situation there s till looks quite tro ubling in the  sense th at the Greenbook projects deflation to continue through 2000 and really through 2001 since prices are flat in 2001. The fiscal stim ulus program they are proposing is very larg e and it suggests that they have  significant concerns about real growth prospects in the future . I just wonder how your views have changed about Japan, which is cer tainly a n important ingred ient to the foreign GDP prospects. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I think we have done two things. We have recognized the fact that we were wrong about the second half of this year. In fact, everybody was wrong; even the Japanese are continuously surprised by the stre ngth in the numbers they are producing. Secondly, we have widened enorm ously--although it is obviously not written down anywhere in the Greenbook--the confidence intervals that we are putting ar ound our forecast for 2000 and 2001. If there is a locus of uncertainty anyw here, it  is centered on Japan, at least in m y mind. On the one hand, we are getting stronger indicators,  at least to som e degr ee, regarding what is happening now. Although we have not seen a priv ate investm ent response, we were certainly surprised by the private consum ption num bers we saw. Strength in the rest  of Asia has helped Japan as well, and the combination has produced GDP numbers that are much larg er than we were expecting. Earlier this year we had expect ed a negative offset to  the very strong first quarte r; we did not ge t that. We now are expec ting a f airly substantial p ositiv e number f or the third quarter. Yet one does not get the sense that  dom estic dem and has be come self-sustaining in Japan. Officials from  the Bank of Japan in the statem ents they have m ade recen tly talk about having seen the trough and having seen a pickup. Yet they talk about demand perhaps not yet being sustained and say that for th at reason th ey are prepared  to keep th e zero in terest rate po licy in place. So, we are looking at their fi scal policy and at what is happening in the rest of the world. The announcem ent of the 18 trillion yen p ackage probably had a sm aller share of “real water” sp ending than th ese packag es have had in the past. We often use a rule of thum b of one-half as the estim ate of real spending in the fiscal program s that are announced by Japanese 11/16/99 15 officials, and we think this one does not com e up even to th at. Common assessm ents are m ore like 6 or 7 trillion, which is a num ber on the orde r of one-third as opposed to one-half of “real water” sp ending. But even that amount would not produce the forecast th at we have written down. So, embedded in our GDP for ecast for calendar year 2 000 is the assum ption that when they decide on the budget they wi ll put in about another ¼ percen tage point of stim ulus through the fiscal channel. That is not  a certainty. No doubt the m edium -term concerns about the size of the outstanding debt and even short-term  concerns  about financing problem s--as they have been struggling with the issu e of who is going to buy the Japanese  governm ent bonds and so forth-­might lead them  to take a less aggressive fiscal posture. And that woul d reduce their growth to less than we have forecast. Even so, I think we have a very cautious fo recast--one that suggests still a lot of problem s in the Japanese econom y and growth that is going to rem ain very low. There are other forecasters around the worl d who see the acceler ation of Japanese activ ity proceeding, as o pposed to falling b ack th e way we do. I think the basic answer is th e one I gave you. There are upside risks and downs ide risks. The confidence interval around any forecast on J apan has to be far wider right now th an would ordinarily be the case.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Mike, I was interested in both the Greenbook discussion and your own comm ents about your reevalua tion of the degree of structural  versus cyclical change in productivity. It certainly has an im plication fo r the potential rate of grow th of GDP. I am wondering whether the decrease that  we have seen in the unem ploym ent rate since the beginning of the year, which has been about  0.4 or 0.5 of a point over the fi rst ten months--. Wasn’t it somewhere around 4.6 percent at  the end of last year? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. This is not going to m aterially affect the add itional-­

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. No, but we have seen a decline of several tenths in the unem ployment rate over the year. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Yes. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. How does one rec oncile that with the idea of an increasing level of potential in the econom y? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I think if potential had been as low as we previously had been gauging it--th is gets a little confusing becaus e we have ch anged the bo oks here--on e might have 11/16/99 16 wondered why the unemploym ent rate had not fallen more. So I think this does fit. And indeed we have reestim ated our Okun’s Law relationshi p and feel reasonably com fortable with the confor mity of our assumptions with what has occurred in term s of the movem ent in the unem ployment ra te. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. So you feel that m akes it more understandable rather than less understandable? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Yes. It wasn’t a really big problem , but it do es seem to be compatible with our assum ptions. Indeed, it is even com patible with Ok un’s Law relationsh ips th at are estim ated from  the incom e side of t he national accounts. There doesn’t seem  to be a great mystery in that resp ect. The little up tick in labo r force participation rate s we have had recently is a bit of a comfort in term s of our understanding of the basic dyna mics in the labor m arket. We don’t feel too uncomfortable with things in that regard. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Potential is ri sing largely because of productivity. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Right.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It is not a labor force phenom enon.

MS. MINEHAN. No, I realize that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further questions for our colleagues?  I want you to understand that th is is a record low n umber of questions ! The Vice Chair predicts th at you will catch up late r. Who would lik e to s tart the Committee dis cussion? President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thanks. The general sense of both business and la bor contacts in the District is that the boom  conti nues and that it will be even st ronger next year. I have been expecting our region of the country to be am ong the first to show signs of flattening out. And I still th ink th at’s a reason able expectation, gi ven the com position of the regional econ omy; at some point, for exam ple, the slowing of auto sale s in the last couple of months should lead to production adjustm ents. But it still basically l ooks and feels like a supply-constrained econom y. Business people com plain that they could be doi ng m ore if only there were m ore warm bodies around that they could put into positions of all type s. The idea of caution is alm ost totally absent from  the discussions we have with bankers and ot her business people. In the last two m eetings of both the Community Bank and th e Business Advisory Councils we have asked the participants to discuss th e conditions under which  they would think abou t the possibility of a recession on the horizon. And they just dism iss it as utterly im plausible and not a fruitful thing to spend tim e 11/16/99 17 thinking and  talking abo ut. We tried to press th e idea, esp ecially on th e bankers, that there is a downside risk. And some do adm it that they know of deals that others are doing that they have walked away from , suggesting p erhaps an elem ent of caution som eplace--but not am ong their competitors at least. I find that very troubling. It may work out that as the dom estic abso rption of goods produced in our region of the country levels out, som e internat ional dem and will pick up an d that will k eep the level of activity in our area more or less even. But I still th ink th e most likely scenar io is that we a re going to ge t back to what in the 1980s som e of us called the soufflé economy--one that is rather soft in the middle and firm  around the edges. Activity up an d down the West Coast and the East Coast m ay stay hotter longer. And if we see som e weakness in our area, th at will make it difficult for those of us in the m iddle part of the country to have  a proper perspective on th e appropriate national, let alone in ternationa l, monetary policy. As a note on one of Karen’s comm ents about Japan, one of our contacts from  an industrial company just returned from Japan and sa id he detected a dram atic change, in a positive direction, in the m ood he  encountered there. His firm  had a large pickup in orders for roller bearings for industrial inputs. All sectors of the labor m arket continue to  be very strong. One of our construction contacts said that their u nion views the auto com pany contracts as a p roblem because they comm it the auto com panies to hire apprentices, which is going to draw on the pool of  workers that o therwise would have been con sidered ava ilable for construction work. So, there is som e sort of rivalry there. Honda m otor com pany announ ced that they will not build a m ajor plant in Ohio after all. Until now  all of their production h as been in O hio. They s aid there is an inadequate pool of labor in Ohio, so they are going to build in Alabam a instead, right next to where Boeing is building an enorm ous operation. So we’ll see how they sort out the w orkers down there. We hear more stories of fast  food r estaurants going to a drive-through only operation and suspending their eat-in service beca use of labor problem s. We are told that contractors in the region are hoping to avoid the usual winter curta ilment of activity because they are concerned that if they  were  to shut down for the usual two or three m onths the workers simply would not return in th e spring. One report from  a construction union in Ohio now estim ates that there are 25,000 Latin o construction workers in the st ate alone and that at least 50 11/16/99 18 percen t of them  are illeg al. And the com plain ts about higher health care costs occu r without exceptions, really. Retail trade overall is reported to be str ong, although the Bob Evans restaurant chain said that they have experienced a sharp slowing in  traffic rec ently. They r elate it to su bstantial increases in their m enu prices that they felt th ey had to put through because of higher wages, higher health care costs, higher tr ansportation costs, and unfilled va cancies in th eir restauran ts. They boosted m enu prices and peopl e stopped com ing; so their earni ngs f ell and their stock price fell. In manufacturing, one director said his firm  is in the early stages of getting som e price relief in major industries. He thought that was a good th ing. He said industrial com panies have been put through an earn ings squeeze in the past year or two and are now goin g to find it easier to improve profit m argins. In conversations with directors as well as advisory c ouncil m embers and others, the suggestion that inflation over the next year or two m ight rem ain the sam e as it has been over the last year or two is sim ply not credible. The expectation that inflation is moving up just does not have any dissenters. And a surprising num ber thi nk that that’s not a bad thing. If I say to people that a reason able f oreca st for the cons umer price index f or the next yea r might be tha t it will r ise a percentage point or so f aster th an in the last twelve m onths or so, there is alm ost no reaction to that. A frustration has been that som e banke rs--and m aybe a fe w others, but it is particularly worrisom e about ba nkers--think an increase in the fe deral funds rate will have an adverse effect on interest-sensitive  industries such as housing and auto s. It’s a sort of interest rate push idea that a rise in the overnight interbank rate pushes up a ll inte rest rates and , theref ore, will hurt real econom ic activ ity which they care about. If you say to them that if it tu rns out later that the funds rate was artificia lly held down and inflation acceler ates and that is what really hurts housin g and autos and other interest-sensitiv e secto rs--because interm ediate- an d long-term interest rates  will rise m ore becau se of inflation prem iums--it falls on d eaf ears. It is simply not a story that resonates well at all.  I think our biggest problem , if it is necessary to tighten in order to contain rising inflationary pressures, is how we explain the rationale behind such an action and find people who support it and applaud it.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an. Not a lot has changed in New England since our last m eeting. Growth continues to be vibrant. Labor m arkets are very tight, and both published data and anecdotal evidence point to in creas ing cos t pressu res, especially as  they regard health insurance prem iums and rising m aterials costs. New England’s unem ploym ent rate fell slightly in Septem ber to 2.9 percent, equaling the series low since data  began to be collected on a regional basis in 1969 and attained only on ce before in April 1988. Wage increases have accelerated this year, at least in manufacturing, by  more than  a percen tage point over 1 998. Moreover, the range of average prospective wage  increases cited by Beigebook contacts rose as well, with the upper end now in the 6 percent rather than the 5 per cent area. Even in the absence of wage acceleration, employers see com pensation co sts rising via sign ifican t increases in health benefits costs. Half the m anufacturers contacte d mentioned very substantial increases in health insurance prem iums. In additi on, while retailers reported vendor  and selling prices as steady, manufacturing contacts reported rising materials costs. The most comm only m entioned price increases were for fuels, plastics, petrochem icals, copper, alum inum, paper, and cardboard. Real estate m arkets remain relatively strong as well. While construction of new homes has hit a b it of a lull, sa les of  existing ho mes rem ain solid  and above year-ago levels. Hom e prices  are a clear s ign of m arket strengt h. The price of a typical home in New England rose by nearly 8 percent versus 5 or 6 percent for the nation; ho me prices rose 9 percent in Massachusetts and about 16 percent in the Boston m etropolitan area. Office m arkets continue to be strong as well, with C lass A space in Bost on continuing to be the most expensive in the nation. Turning to the national outlook, both current data and prospects for the near term continue to defy expectations of a slowdown of any m agnitude. To be sure, housing and durable goods sales were a bit slower, as were auto sales,  but interest rates have backed off a bit, the stock m arket rem ains positiv e, and consum er confidence is h igh. We now also seem to have evidence m ore firm ly in hand to explain the eco nomy’s current ability to grow without undue strain. With the revisions in GDP data, we are now looking back at higher rates of real growth, higher productivity, and a higher leve l of potential GDP. This is great stuff, but it is backward looking. One can hope the future will look like th e recen t past, but it m ay be wise to b e a bit skeptical about whether it will. 11/16/99 20 I find the Greenbook forecast to be v ery interesting, and I th ink Mike seem ed to indicate th at he does as well, becau se in m any ways it’s pess imistic. To be sure, it ass umes that productivity  is higher no t only becau se of the rev isions bu t also because o f a larger sh are th at is thought to be m ore structural than cyclical. It also assum es that potential is correspondingly higher, that monetary policy ti ghtens by 50 basis points over the ne xt year or so, and that the long awaited m oderatio n in consumer dem and and st ock price growth actually take p lace. And even with all that, core inflation ticks up nearly ½ point from 1999 to 2000 and a bit m ore in 2001. It would seem  that a rise in prices is ba ked in the cake, even if all of  these m oderating influences a ctually occu r. But will they occur ? To m e the answer to tha t question re volves importantly around whether or not o ne believes pr oductivity  growth can continue to accelerate, not just as a reflection of out put grow th but as a reflecti on of a higher trend rate. I’ve thought a lot about productiv ity since our last m eeting; it would have been hard not to. On the one hand, as I look around m y District, it seem s obvious that tight labor m arkets are bringing entry level workers and others whose skills are m arginal into the workf orce. This is a good thing for them  and for society as a whol e, since obviously work provides the best opportunity for them  to improve their chances in life. But they are not  exactly enhancing the firms’ productivity, at least in the short run. On the other ha nd, I see wages being linked to profits m ore tightly than ever; and ev en very larg e com panies ar e continuing to be very cost conscious. My 17-year old son, whom  I have me ntioned in the past, recently graduated from selling CDs at Circuit City for $9 plus an hour to selling sm all electroni cs. After a two-week training program , he is now totally on comm ission--no base salary at all unl ess he fails to m ake the m inimum wage, in which case he will like ly be back se lling CDs. The com pany has a re al time system  that lets him know at any m oment during the day how m uch he has earned so far that day o r how m uch in the hole h e might be becau se a cu stom er has returned an item he sold. Believe m e, he has becom e very foc used on closi ng a sale! He knows what he m akes from  every single product. He m ay not know the exact price, but he knows his comm ission, and he is very focused on selling the rig ht thi ng to the right custom er. I also attended a conference at IBM at whic h Lou Guerstner talked for two hours or so about the restructuring of  IBM’s internal business processes usi ng web technology, taking $6 billion or so off a $50 billion pro curem ent budget, fo r exam ple. Productiv ity in creases  are real. They are em bedded in how people are paid and how  businesses work. That seem s undebatable. 11/16/99 21 I think what is debatable is how long rising p roductivity grow th will continue to prov ide the needed buffer between all th e resou rce pressu res in the economy a nd higher and potentially rising rates of inflation. In that regard, it would seem  that there is an increasing degree of  resource pressure. Labor m arkets show no sign of easing. Rising ov erall costs should cause em ployees to seek higher wage increases, and rising profits should lift bonuses, which fell off earlier this year. Benefits costs are rising, especially f or medical  insurance. Export growth is strengthening as foreign growth takes off, and the dollar is m ore li kely to depreciate than not. That is a long-winded way of pointing out that all o f the risks to the forecas t seem  to m e even m ore fi rmly planted on the upside than they were at the last meeting. Accelerating rates of productivity growth m ay have provid ed breathing  room , and who knows whether th ey will last. But in m y view anyway, the direction if not the tim ing of the next needed m ove in monetary policy is less uncertain than ever. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Econom ic activity in the Eleven th District advanced  at a healthy rate in the third quarter, and em ploym ent growth continued to run at  rates abou t twice the n ationa l average. In retro spect, it appears that the Di strict was more adversely affected by th e Asian crisis than we initially th ought and we are now benefiting fro m the rebou nd. For example, exports are posting solid gains, th e oil business is up, th e chem ical industry ha d an excellent third quarter, and District high -tech com panies continue to do well. At least one chem ical producer is expecting the best quarter in his company’s history due to the re bound in Asian dem and. The construction sector, which played an important role in sustaining employm ent growth for the first half of the year, has soft ened  som ewhat in recen t months, in line with national trends. The single-fam ily segm ent has softened. Houston hom ebuilders are reporting that they are beginning to catch up on past backlogs and that m aterials sh ortages are disappearing. Infrastructure projects, such as  new  sports stadium s in Dallas and Houston and expansion at Houston’s airports and the port, are helping to sustai n the construction sector in the face of a weakening in the housing com ponent. The oil and gas sector also is recoveri ng but cautiously. Many producers rem ain uncertain ab out how committed OPEC is to the round of production cu ts announced earlier this year and a re unwilling to  make big bets th at the recent incre ases in oil prices will stic k. Thus, 11/16/99 22 most of  the increas e in U .S. drilling a ctivity since April has been directed to natural gas. Also, recen t merger activity h as imm obilized som e of the larger p layers. And if you would like a pun, one m ight say that Mobil has imm obilized since they  reorganized. All of the increase in recent activity is concentrated among the independents, although m any of them  are finding them selves financially constrained for havi ng violated bank loan covenants during the period of low oil prices. On Mexico, there is little new to report on the m acro front. GDP growth rem ains strong along with the peso. The m ain developm ents since the last FOMC m eeting center on issues regar ding the tax ation of  the m aquillador as and the p ossibility of  tighter r estrictions on cross-border m ovements of  people and vehicles. Turning to national conditions, it is clear despite the broad-based--and likely to be upwardly revised--expansion of GDP in the third quarter that econom ic growth is slowing somewhat. The residential construction sector has clearly peaked and consum er spending has been decelerating over the course of the year. There are som e signs that manufacturing slowed as we m oved from  the third quarter into the four th. However, the pickup in global activity will provide a boost to growth as we m ove forward. On the inflation front, most of the deterior ation in recent m onths has been in energy prices o r other transitory phenom ena such as the spike in c igarette prices and possibly distorted seasonals in auto prices. When stripped of  the food and energy categories, our broadest measures of inflation, the deflators for persona l consum ption expenditures and gross dom estic purchases, have been stable in the 1 to 1½ per cent range all of  this year. We do not expect significan t acceleration any tim e soon. I believe there are a n umber of reasons for optim ism about the inflation outlook. While labor m arkets rem ain tight, or if anything have gotten tighter, we still don’t see a signif icant accele ration in wage pressu res. The eviden ce that there has been an increase in productivity growth  is stronger now than it was early  this summ er. The pickup in productivity  growth can account for a lot of the favorable developm ents we have seen at the national level recently, and to m e there is no reas on to believ e that it wi ll be reversed any tim e soon. Finally, other leading indicat ors of inflation such as comm odity prices are giving m ixed signals at best. Having said that, it must be acknowledged that a num ber of the inflation indicators are flashing red and warrant close m onitoring. I am thinking in particular of the 11/16/99 23 We’ve seen recen t movements in the supplier deliveries and p rices p aid co mponents of the National Association of Purchasing Ma nagers’ report on manufac turing, both of which have exceed ed 50 percen t for six con secutive m onths. The crude goods and interm ediate goods PPI indexes,  ex-food and energy, hav e accelerated st eadily ov er the course of the year and we’ve seen a recen t acceleratio n in non-oil im port prices . However, on closer ex amination som e of these trends are less disturbing than they a ppear. While non-oil im port prices have posted increases in recen t months, the fact rem ains that they are s till down from where they were this time last year. Secondly,  despite the recen t adverse trend s, the core crude and interm ediate goods com ponents of the PPI seem  to have stabil ized som ewhat, looking at the 3-m onth m oving average of the annualized m onthly changes, whic h leaves only the Purchasing Managers’ report as a real source of concern. While these indicator s suggest the need for continued vigilance, in the absen ce of corroborating ev idence of accelerating inflatio n these data in and of them selves do not constitu te a clear and  present d anger.

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, the Twelfth Di strict econom ic expansion continues to outpace the average for the rest of th e nation. During th e third quarter, employm ent grew at a 2.4 percen t rate, exactly equal to the pace during the first half  of the year. However, growth in most of our states, including California, has been slower this year than it was in 1998, so that the District growth rate has been edging down toward the national av erage. Other than Alaska and Hawaii, District states rem ain strong, though I would point out th at tourist spending is producing even a further pickup in Nevada th is year. California has been e xpanding a bit m ore rapidly than the rem ainder of the District, and the state unem ploym ent rate has fallen just over a percentage point since the end of last year to 4.8 percent in O ctober. The short-run outlook for the District expansion rem ains quite favorable. Housing m arket activity has been vigorous, although the increases this year m ostly have been in fast -grow ing southern California. Growth has been somewhat slower elsewh ere and resid ential cons truction activity has been f lat or down in several urban areas. Slower appreciation in s ales pr ices for exis ting h omes is evid ent in som e areas as well. On the upside, we are seeing renewed dem and for District electronic products. Following three lean years, prices and sales of  key sem iconductor products have picked up this 11/16/99 24 year, and in California electron ics manufacturers have gained back  many of the jobs lost during 1998. Turning to the national econom y, labor m arkets certainly have tightened a bit further since we last m et. The rapid real GDP growth in  the th ird qua rter led to a further sligh t decline in the unem ploym ent rate, and our forecast for re al GDP growth of about 3½ percen t next year is, of course, very sim ilar to that of the Greenboo k. This suggests that labor m arket pressures are unlikely to abate any time soon. But while labor co sts m ay well pick up in the future, these costs do not appear to have been particularly burdens ome to businesses in the recent past. Despite apparently tight labor m arkets th e ECI has risen only 3.1 percent over the past year. And while compensation per hour has risen m uch faster, unit la bor cost increases receded last quarter due to strong productivity grow th. Moreover, rapid real GDP growt h and low price inflation in the third quarter, together with what appears to be a pickup in profits, also suggest that aggregate supply has continued to expand at  a robust pace. This provide s room  for at least guarded optim ism about inflation. After balancing these signals, we com e out with a slight upward trend for the core CPI. Our forecast shows a rise from  2.1 percen t this year to 2 .3 and 2.4 percen t resp ectively in the next two years. Even such a slight upward trend in future pri ce inflation is a concern. As we know, howe ver, such an upswing has looked likely for several years but has not m aterialized. In problem s ahead or on past results that have been quite favorable. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Seventh District econom y continues to be quite healthy, but  reports from  our directors and other business contacts suggest that a ctivity is m oderatin g som ewhat in a num ber of sectors. At the sam e time, we are also getting m ore frequent reports of increasing wages as a result of  still very tight labor m arkets. We have seen som e slowing in housi ng activity, but that sector seem s to be holding up better than elsewhere in the nation. Many of  our retailers indicate that sales have been running below expectations recen tly, bu t they gen erally rem ain quite op timistic about th e upcom ing holiday sales season. Nationally, sales of autos and light trucks  have com e down fr om the stratospheric levels repo rted for the th ird quarter. Of cour se, the 16½ m illion light v ehicles so ld in October 11/16/99 25 still repres ents a very h igh sales level. Indeed, that base is 1 m illion above  total sales for all of last year, which the industry cons idered a very good year. In fact, som e of the autom akers and suppliers we have talked to we lcom e som e moderation in activity. Some suppliers tell us that they are actu ally losing money on increm ental b usiness when activity is as high as it has been because of their h igh m arginal input costs. Some potential slowing is al so apparent in the heavy tr uck industry wher e the back log has been whittled down f rom 9 months to jus t over 7 m onths, but tha t is still higher tha n the historical norm . One of our form er directors noted that shortage s of truck drivers have led his firm to cut back in ordering new trucks. Reports  also indicate som e slowi ng in cem ent, paper, and printing, although business is st ill considered to be good in thes e industries. In contrast, the medium -duty truck industry shows no signs of slowing, our steel industr y continues to im prove, and gypsum  wallboard shipm ents are st ill up sharply from  a year ago. The District’s farm  econom y, however, conti nues to struggle as a result of  abundant supplies and low commodity prices. On the othe r hand, one large farm  equipm ent m anufacturer that I was talking to surprised me by saying that they plan to  boost production next year and rehire workers they laid off ev en though dem and for the firm’s products is going to rem ain weak. The reason is that the firm signifi cantly reduced dealer inventories th is year. They took a lot of products out of the pipeline and they are going to have to rest ock next year. Our labor markets are still ve ry, very tight. However, th e latest Manpower survey of hiring intentions indicates that m ost industries will continue extens ive recruiting efforts into next year’s first quarter--m ore of the sam e. This re port, of course, should be  considered confidential until it is pu blicly released next Mon day, the 22nd. So far actual price in creases continue to be subdued. However, our latest survey  of Michigan retailers indicates that they plan to raise prices over the next three m onths and m ost purchasing m anagers around the District continue to report paying higher prices for their inputs. Y2K, of course, rem ains a big question m ark in the near-term  outlook. We have checked with a wide variety of businesses, and th e general sense we get is that com panies feel they are prepared, although concerns rem ain about  the readiness of firm s abroad. We made a special effort to contact c onvention and tourism  bureaus in our m ajor m etropolitan areas, and they said that they had not heard of any advers e impact on business p lans fo r early next year. In fact, they w ere all pretty optim istic that Y2K would actually boost business for them . 11/16/99 26 Turning to the nation al econom y, the  Board’s staff has raised its forecast o f output growth in the next few quarters, as Mike m entioned, but it has rais ed its estim ate of trend growth even m ore. Thus in the Greenbook scenario, growth slows to below poten tial, easing som e of the pressures in the labo r market. Even so, co re CPI inflatio n accelerates m arkedly by 2001 to a level that on a m ethodologically consistent basis would be the worst since 1995. We, too, have raised our estim ates of productivity growth and potential output , although not to th e extent of the Board’s staff. But we don’t see actual growth falling below these higher levels of potential over the forecast period. Certainly the higher long-term interest rates that have already im pacted the housing m arket should act as restraint, but busin ess and consum er confide nce rem ains quite high, and the stock m arket, of course, has recovered m ost of its recent losses. More im portantly, in contrast to the last few years,  with improved conditions abroad we expect m uch less drag from the external sector, sim ilar to the Greenbook. Thus we see growth slowing only to about its new trend and only after labor m arket conditions have becom e slightly  tighter. Not surprisingly, we are even m ore pessim istic than  the Greenbook about inflation. Hard evidence like consum er price p ressures outs ide the energy s ector is still s carce, bu t the continu ed incre ases in the PPI are worrisom e. Thus, I think we need to be especially caref ul not to sacrifice th e progress toward price stability that has been a cornerstone of this e xpansion. The low inflation environm ent is clearly responsible for som e of the fast er productivity growth that we ha ve experienced, and we all want to maintain that m omentum.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. In our District, activity continues to grow at a solid pace overall, m aybe even a bit more than solid. Sales in our region seem  to have accelerated in October and those stro ng sales app ear to b e continuing in  Novem ber. Generally retailers in our region are fair ly optimistic about prospects fo r the holiday season. Activity elsewhere in the service sector  is less buoyant, particularly in the real estate industry. Manufacturing activity rem ains on a rathe r sign ificant up swin g. The exceptions, as I have mentioned before in these m eetings, are textile and apparel m anufacturi ng in the Ca rolin as. A lot of those com panies are m oving their operations to Mexico. Like everybody else who has commented, what  can I say except that labor m arkets are still very tight?  But I w ould unde rline Mike Prell’s comm ent that stories about pressures in labor 11/16/99 27 tight labor m arket anecdotal co mments, but they are m ore freque nt and they are m uch m ore emphatic on the part of employers than earlier. Also, over the last several weeks I have heard a number of employers talk, again emphatically, about very sizable wa ge increases. I attended the annual m eeting of the Virginia Governor’s Reven ue Forecas ting Comm ittee yesterday , which includes a num ber of CEOs of large com panies. At that m eeting they have a business conditions go-around, and I would say that at least a third an d maybe half of the participants m entioned recen t increases in wages, which in s ome cases were sizable. One person talked abou t 10 to 15 percen t increases for skilled workers . Firm s are doing this in order to attract and to re tain people. Often the wage increases are for skille d workers, but others ar e involved as well. With respect to prices, we st ill don’t see any general increa se in the price level in our area, but underlying pressures m ay be building. Interm ediate prices  appear to be rising broadly in the industrial sector accordi ng to many of our contacts. We hear the sam e kinds of comments a lot of others have already m entioned about ri sing health care costs. One of our Richmond directors who runs a hospital in Char lottesville re ferred to H MO costs as “exploding” and said it was clear that those costs would have to be passed on. That is the District situation. With respect to the natio nal econom y, I have read a lot of Greenbook forecasts ov er the years and, naturally, have found som e more pers uasive than others. But I found this m onth’s projections and the reasoning behind them  very persuasive. The bottom  line as I read it--and I think it’s the way Cathy Minehan read it--is this: While recen t increases in long-term  interest rates and a less buoyant stock m arket m ay slow th e growth in aggregate dem and to som e extent in the period imm ediately ahead, we probably are alrea dy somewhat behind the inflation curve. And that is likely to becom e more apparent as tim e passes. Beyond this, the overall tone of the Greenbook--and also I think m uch of the recent ec onom ic data if one looks at them  carefully-­suggests to m e that the risk of error in this ev en quite strong f orecast rem ains on the u pside. We hear som e comm ents about signs of softening in  the econom y. That sou nds to m e a little like saying that Mark McGuire had a so fter season th is year than last  year. Overall spending growth is currently still very strong desp ite the recen t leveling off in hom e sales. The big ju mp in hours worked in October suggests to m e that real GDP  growth in the current quarter cou ld well exceed the 4 percent Greenbook projection. And there is a possi bility, as Karen Johnson m entioned, of a greater-than-expected depreciation of  the dollar. In general, I think th ese upside risks com pound 11/16/99 28 the prospective deterioration in  the inflation outlook that is already built into the Greenbook forecast. Let m e make just a couple of other quick points. First, I think the Greenbook is quite correct in suggesting that the m oderation in wage  increases w e have seen over the last two or three m onths m ay well reflect the drop in inflation last year. In fact, I think the record shows that wage-setting b ehavior in th e last few year s has generally responded to recen t movements in prices. With both overall and core inflation acce lerating la tely, I think we can expect to s ee faster wage growth next year. And in m y view that is cons istent with the  anecdota l information mentioned by m e and by a num ber of others earlier. Second and finally, I was pleased to see th e explicit recognition in the Greenbook that faster trend productivity growth im plies higher real interest rates.  I think one of the principal policy questions we need to ask ourselves later in the m eeting is whether the tigh tening action s we have tak en to date are sufficient to allow the upward adju stment in real rates that is neces sary to keep th e econom y in balance, g iven recen t productiv ity developm ents. The alternative is that we m ay be holding rates below where they need to  be to acco mplish that objective, w ith all of the inflation risk that would im ply. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, the Tenth Dist rict also continues to do quite well; w e have not seen a lot of change since our last m eeting. On the basis of our surveys of District activity, there has been som e slowing in the residential housing market from  the earlier rapid pace and a b it of slowing  in som e areas of retail s ales. In the m anufacturing sector, the picture is som ewhat m ixed. While dom estic dem and has slowed som e, there has been a pronounced pickup in foreign dem and in som e of our manufacturing industries. For ex ample, a foundry and som e of th e metals m anufacturers in our District have seen a very strong pickup in forei gn orders. Our energy sect or continues to expand right now as they look at these favorable prices . We are prim arily natu ral gas driven and, of course, weather has som e impact. But even with some of the current m ild weather patterns, our producers still s ee a goo d outlook as  they judge their supp lies. Mike Moskow m entioned the weakness in the agricultural sector. We, too, have had very strong production this year, so prices rem ain low and that se ctor is very m uch dependent upon the continued strength in transfer paym ents. One of the secondary elem ents in our 11/16/99 29 agricu ltural and rura l areas is th at, frankly, the re has been stro ng dem and for autos and  especially trucks as these transfer paym ents have been made. So, actually, cash incom es remain fairly good, and that has been reflected in a strong eco nomy in some of those agricultural areas. Overall, though, econom ic activity in our District is extrem ely strong. Labor m arkets are tight everywhere. We hear constant discussions abou t the difficulties th at firm s are exp eriencing in their ef forts to f ind workers to f ill jobs. Let m e turn very briefly to the national out look. We, too, see the gr owth in GDP to be at better than a 3½ percent pace, and we also are taking in to account som e of the im provem ents in productivity in that outlook. Looking forward, we see the foreign sector picking up and offsetting so me of the deceleration o n the dom estic sid e. So as we look at these variou s elem ents, th e preponderance of evid ence suggests to  us that the risk to th e forecast is on the upside in term s of total dem and within the U.S. econom y. Personally, I still think there is a good case for acting now, though we haven’t quite come to that discussion, whether one looks at it as preem ptive or as a reversal of the insurance policy we to ok out a year ago. We took that insu rance in th e face of a very strong real econom y. Its ef fects a re still work ing in th e econom y and I think that factor is aggravating the upward risk that I see. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Over all growth in the Southeastern region remains healthy, but with som e uneve nness across sectors. For exam ple, m anufacturing, which as I reported was a bit soft at the tim e of our last m eeting, has bounced back, with current production and shipm ents higher and the outlook view ed as optim istic as well. Tourism, on the other hand, appears to have slowe d, but a closer look reveals very large increases in capacity in hotel room s and cruise ships, and thus the m aintenance of past occupancy rates is difficult. Housing in our region continues to show som e slowdown, m irroring the national reports, and that is being attributed to the rise in mortgage rates. Several la rge banks are reporting that their mortgage loan originations are off as much as 50 percent from six m onths  ago. Other lenders tell us that the volum e of refinancing is running le ss than 10 percent of the volum e this time last year. Single-family new construction  is flat and b oth nonres idential and multifam ily construction has slowed som ewhat. 11/16/99 30 By contrast our energy sector continues to reverse earlier de clines in drilling, with the rig count up still another notch from  a month a go. Lenders report that corporate loan dem and continues at a high level but is moderating. Interestingly, our international exam iners tell us that they ar e now seeing sig nificant c apital f light out of Venezuela and Colombia, and som e from Ecuador. Some of that money is going into second hom es in south Florida. And some Colom bians have m oved their fam ilies to Florid a and are com muting to an d from  Colombia each week. Our overall regional unemploym ent rate is below the national average, but the very tight labor m arket still has not yet resulted in widespread wage  pressures. The m ost notable large p rice increas es rep orted once again, as o thers have observed, are in health care. This m onth we asked our directors to probe  hard in three areas : for eviden ce of potential liquidity problem s at financial institutions and am ong their custom ers over the com ing year-end period, for signs of a Y2K-related pull back  in investm ent activities, and for evidence of credit qua lity p roblem s. At this po int, th ere is just no gras s roots ev idence of  Y2K-related liquidity problem s, as everyone seems to have lock ed in their financing needs for the end of the year. Indeed, we often heard that many still are expecting to see a signif icant inflow of funds into th e United State s, particula rly from Latin Am erica, over the rem ainder of the year. As best we can judge, Y2K is just not a big deal for people  we talk to in our region. Our directors tell us, and our bankers confirm , that credit quality  generally seem s to be im proving. There are exceptions in the health care industry and agricu lture, and we have reports of a few isolated problem s at community banks. On the national front, moderate inflation and further advances in em ploym ent, together with a recen t upward revision in the GDP statistics, m ake the econom y’s perform ance even m ore rem arkable when assess ed agains t the historical record. We read the new data as suggesting at least a som ewhat gr eater likelihood of con tinued strength in the consum er sector that will carry the expansion forward. The broade r definition of personal savings suggests that consum er balance sh eets are not as weak as som e may have fe ared. Newly revised data on consum ers’ debt burdens suggest that consum ers are carrying less debt relative to incom e than they did in the peak periods of the 1980s. Finall y, bankruptcies appear to have leveled off. I think the fundam entals are still in place fo r strong growth. 11/16/99 31 Despite the good news and favorable data on the price front, I think there are still valid reasons to be concerned about th e inflation outlook. My own staff’s judgm ental and VAR model forecasts are sim ilar to th ose contained in the Greenbook. Our work sugg ests only a sm all probability that inflation will average below 2 percent in 2000  and a not in significan t probability that it cou ld move to slig htly m ore than 3 percen t. On a percentage basis that would be a very large and worrisom e deterioration. In addition to the identified pr ice pressure points that a num ber of people have referred to, I would n ote again that other than producti vity many of the safety valves and m itigating factors that m ight have conti nued to cushion inflationary pressures have one-by-one turned against us. World econom ic growth is im provi ng, exchange rates are responding to the U.S. trade deficit as expected, im port prices are in creasing, and energy and other comm odity prices have reversed their m oderating effects. Our policy choices today seem  to m e to be qui te similar to what they we re at our last meeting. We still have a good window of opportun ity to provide m odest additional low-cost insurance that will im prove our chances of locking in our good inflation perform ance and tempering inflationary expecta tions. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you. The District econom y rem ains healthy. If anything, it has improved even further because a couple of th e sectors that were lagging--nam ely, iron ore mining and oil exp loration--have p icked up recen tly, albeit in the cas e of oil exp loration from  a relatively low base. Otherwise, m anufacturing is  strong and construction activity is uniform ly strong. Retail sales are robust a nd in general re tailers are quite optim istic about the upcom ing holiday season. Labor m arkets remain very tight . But interestingly--and I have no explanation for this--if you ask retailers about the availability of tem porary part-tim e workers for the holiday season they say it’s no problem  finding them . How they are m anaging that I don’t know, but that’s the re port. The exception to all of this is the sam e old exception, which is agriculture. The principal problem  there, of course, is commodity prices. There is no question that problem s in agriculture per se have spilled over to the rural econom y more generally if one looks at employm ent measures in the rural areas. Thos e people don’t have any tro uble finding jobs in the 11/16/99 32 cities, so they don’t rem ain unem ployed for long. But, of course, they do have the adjustm ent of moving or comm uting from  the farm to the city. As far as the national econom y is concer ned, it se ems to m e that we are in a circum stanc e where sub stantial rea l growth is assured and th e question is  what inf lation will accom pany it. What can we say about inflationa ry prospects? The Green book has what I, at least, consider to be a major new look at produc tivity and com es out, I think, with a significantly more positiv e pictu re. And the Greenbook forecast now is in  many respects a lot like our VAR forecast. One m ight think that the more favorable  path of p roductivity, other things equal, would lead to a dim inution of concerns about prospective inflation and in flation ary pres sures. But the Greenbook basically has the sam e old song as far as inflation is concerned. And I guess I have to say that I’m  just not entirely persuaded. Our m odel has for som e time been m ore sanguine about the inflation outlook and it rem ains that way. I think it’s very clea r that a lot is happening on the supply side of our economy, perhaps m ore than we  know. If we calculate productivity from  the incom e side rather than f rom the output side, we continue to com e up with significantly m ore favorable numbers. So, if anything, my uncertain ty about the inflationary outlook has increased rather than dim inished at this point.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The e conom ic growth in the Second District has m oderated si nce our last report. Overall consum er price inflation h as barely accelerated, thou gh there are scattered rep orts of som e rising p rices--for exam ple, in m anufacturing inputs, housing, and hotel room s. The unem ploym ent rate continued to hover close to 5 percent in September, but pr ivate sector job growth slowed to a 1.1 percent annual rate, well below the 1.9 percent pace in th e past 12 m onths. Retailers note that sales hav e been som ewhat sluggish in recent weeks. They  remain fairly optim istic, h owever, abo ut the upcom ing holiday season. But a number of reta ilers think th at the p ricing environm ent is shaping up to be m ore com petitiv e than las t year . Housing activ ity has moderated s omewhat from  a spring-summ er boom , though m arkets rem ain quite tight. In the New York City metropolitan  area a shortage of available hom es has eviden tly crim ped sales and spurred double-digit incr eases in both s elling p rices and in re nts. Multif amily construc tion activ ity in the District remains brisk; single-fa mily building has tapered off. Purchasing m anagers report som e moderation in growth in October al ong with persistent price pressu res. Banks report a decline in 11/16/99 33 loan dem and, a noticeable tightening in credit standards, and continued improvem ent in delinquency rates. There is m uch virtue in th e banking sector, if you believe all they tell you. On the natio nal outlook, we forecast growth at a 4 percen t rate in the fourth quarter. We think growth will moderate further in 2000 a nd 2001. The prim ary cause of this slowing is the rise of long-term  interest rates thus fa r in 1999, which has caused housing construction and sales to decline in recen t months. Higher in terest rates h ave also brought  mortgage refinancing activ ity to a virtu al halt; for many hom eowners refinancing h ad lowered household d ebt serv ice burdens and had provided a convenient way to extrac t equity from  their hom es. Finally, the rise of interest rates has been associated w ith a leveling off of stock prices, which m ay be contributing to the m oderation in growth of cons umer spending evident in  the th ird quarte r and apparently continuing in the fourth quarter. Net exports are expect ed to continue to exert a drag on the economy, while the boost from inventory bu ilding fades som ewhat. We believe that the potential g rowth rate of the econom y is now about 3½ percen t. Our growth forecast fo r 2000 is 3.2 percen t and for 2001 it is 3 p ercent. If we  are wrong, however, we th ink growth will b e somewhat higher becau se of possibly  stronger gr owth abroad and a possib ly strong er wealth effect if stock and bond m arkets return to th eir upward trend. Since our baseline forecast has core infla tion creeping up from about 2 percent now to 2¾ percen t in 2001 under an assum ption of no policy ch ange by this Comm ittee, a m odest additional tightening wo uld be appro priate in surance again st aggregate dem and exceeding the supply side’s ability to produce good s and services. I should note, however, that I absolutely and vehem ently disagree with any notion th at this Co mmittee is b ehind the cu rve. In addition to the likely help on price stab ility that a m odest tightening would involve, I think it would also help to reduc e the current account deficit som ewhat. We have to be careful about the cu rrent accoun t deficit. It’s easy to fin ance it because of the attractiven ess of U.S. assets. But it is clearly a l onger-term  problem . And when we  have an opportunity to do something about it, we should take it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I can summarize the inform ation from  our contacts in the Eighth D istrict in four points. First, housing activity is definitely a bit slower, but not a whole lot. Second, labor m arket pressures continue, but despite is olated areas of sizable wage gains th ere is no generalized break -out from  the recent exp erience of m odest wage in creases. 11/16/99 34 Third, product pricing rem ains unde r good control overall. Fourth, ev eryone is tired of  talking about Y2K. Nobody has anything to say there; nothing in fact seem s to be happening. My FedEx and UPS contacts bo th rep orted recen t increases in volum e. Measuring on a year-over-year basis, the August-S eptem ber mont hs are stronger than th e earlier months. So, they see thin gs accelerating. And UPS, anyway, is revising up  its volum e projections f or next year. Both UPS and Fe dEx confirm the Greenbook view that Asia and Eu rope are strong. Latin America is relatively flat; not m uch is going on ther e. Firm s continue to cope satisfactorily with the labor m arket pressures. UPS relies a great deal on college students as part-tim e labor. The firm has increased the rewards, and my i mpression is that students are com ing out of the woodwork to throw packages. Changing gears to a different topic, I want to em phasize m y view that th e asymmetry announced at the last m eeting did exactly what I certainly had hoped it w ould do. In response to the strong incom ing data, m arket rates m oved up. Then as the data cam e in benign later in the interm eeting period, rates m oved bac k down. So I think the asymmetry di d precisely what we, or at least I, expected it to do. That’s all I want to say at this point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Using orthodox reasoning, I think a case for tightening policy at this m eeting could be m ade fairly readily. The flat funds rate version of th e Greenboo k forecast has aggregate dem and growing at a rate of nearly 5  percen t in this half year and nearly 4 percent for the next  two years. Starting fr om a position where labor potential G DP growth. It represents a littl e too much de mand pressure even for our new econom y and would seem to call for a tightening of  policy to trim  som e of this pressure. But at the last m eeting, Mr. Chairm an, you challenged us to think about the econom y in new ways. I’m afraid I don’t have a ne w way of thinking about aggregate dem and and aggregate supply, but there is a new way to think about m onetary policy--one that we have not talked about m uch in this room  but one that is sweeping the globe outside of this room. It is inflation targeting, a m onetary approach that I’m  told is now being used in 44 countries. In most of these cou ntries infla tion targe ting has seem ed to be success ful in contro lling inflatio n. And in many of them it has seem ed to be successful  in lim iting output variation as well. 11/16/99 35 First, on inflation targeting itself, one can ge t to it through a fairly  logical progression. The idea of monetary targeting ran in to difficulty  because of shocks in liq uidity d emand. These shocks m ade it d ifficult to interpr et the growth of the m onetary aggregates. Did growth m ean that the econ omy was overheati ng or sim ply that there was an upward shift in dem and for liquidity?  The next step was to m ove to nom inal incom e targeting, an approach that m any still favor. But again there are shocks, this tim e from  productivity. If nom inal incom e is growing rapidly, does that m ean that the econom y is overheating or simply that productivity has risen? Given these shocks, one m ight reas onably conclude that the central  bank should target inflation directly. Inflation is what we are trying to stab ilize, so  we should just stabilize it. One could use either a m odel or a non-m odel approach for inf lation targeting. In the present circum stances, the Gr eenbook m odel approach clearly  suggests tightening policy. Acceleration  of inflation occurs gradually in the f lat funds rate version of the Greenbo ok forecast and it would take a fairly em phatic tightening of po licy to stop it. As we all know, this occurs because the econom y is now operating below th e Greenboo k’s estim ate of NAIRU. To be sure, there is growing professional doubt about this estim ate. In early 1997, Staiger, Stock, and Watson had a piece in th e Journal of Econom ic Prospectives in which they estim ated a confidence band for NAIRU that ranged from  4.3 to 7.3 percent so that unem ploym ent was not found to be a particularly good predictor of futu re inflation. Recently, a paper by Brainard and Perry built in coefficients that follow a random  walk through tim e and are not constrained to revert to any particular level. This procedur e gives estim ates of NAIRU that are even below present unemploym ent rates. These papers are controversial, but that’s ju st the point. It may make sense to look for other ways to target inflation. Turning to nonstructural appr oaches, these can be preem ptive if there are lags in monetary policy. In that event, nonstructu ral approaches would involve finding leading indicators or other forecasts of inflation and ha ving the Fed move on the ba sis of their signals. Unfortunately, there are not m any good leading indicato rs. One th at I w ill call the “ pipeline” indicator is the core PPI. The latest n umbers for that index are not very re assuring ; the core PPI is growing at an annual rate of about 6 percent. Mike Prell cau tioned us earlier not to look only at the core b ut at the to tal PPI. I don ’t have th at figure here, but it would sim ilarly be not very reassuring. Given the likely fall in  the dollar and the strength in world comm odity prices, not all of which are reflected in the core  PPI, there could be even m ore price pressure in the pipeline. 11/16/99 36 It’s always risky to generalize fr om a few m onthly num bers, but I would still cons ider these d ata as suggesting that policy should be tightened. A further ap proach m ight be to look at the inflation forecasts of others. The Greenbook Part II has useful information on this on page II-34. For the pa st three years now, the consum er surveys by Michigan have expected a ri se in inflatio n, meaning that their forecast of inflation h as been above curren t rates. On the other hand, th eir m edian forecast of inflation is now no higher than it was two years ago, indicati ng that they m ay not be fully current on the impact of supply shocks, ti ght labor m arkets, and so forth. It’s hard to know whether to read this as a forecas t of rising inf lation or s table inflati on. Things sho uld be clearer for the pro fessional forecaster, b ut they are n ot. Those su rveyed by th e Philade lphia Fed also h ave expected m ore inflation than actually occurred for the past few years. Again, these forecasters have not raised their forecas ts in recen t months. It is som etimes argued th at that is becau se they exp ect the Fed to stabilize inflation. But these forecasters have also built into their forecasts only a very slight rise in short-term  interes t rates, as have the Blue Chip forecas ters, which could be a partially overlapp ing group. The Blue Chip forecasters d o not  look for a particu larly b ig rise in inflation and they se em to be forecasting tha t the Fed will only have to  tighten policy very slig htly to prevent this rise. In the end th e forecasts of inflation do not help us m uch, though there m ay be a very weak vote for tightening policy. Where does all this leave  us? To m e, the structural m odel approach to inflation targeting suggests rather clearly that we ought to tighten. The pi peline approach suggests the same som ewhat clearly , and the app roach of con sulting o ther forecasters gi ves only a weak vote. While the intensity varies, all i ndicators do point in one directi on, however, and I am  inclined to think we should point that way, too.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. At the last m eeting I think m any of us were willing to take a patient but vigilant atti tude, recognizing that a gr eat deal of data would becom e available during the inte rmeeting period. Now those data have becom e available and we seem  to be faced with a choice between what I’ll  describ e as policy op timism  and policy caution. On the optim istic side, the m ost recent NIPA revisions do g ive a reason to  believ e that productivity trends have continued to rise. Capital deep ening, I gather, is pr obably the source of this positive outcom e as outlays for equipm ent a nd software have been extrem ely strong. While 11/16/99 37 the staff’s new estim ate for trend labor productiv ity growth must be approached with som e caution, I do  note that a num ber of private sector forecasters also have revised upward their estim ates over the last year or so. I think we should be open to  the possibility that the staff, though perhaps ahead of  others, m ay have gotten it right. However, policy caution also sets in when one recognizes that even if the speed limit is som ewhat higher, the econom y is still at this stage exceed ing that lim it at a tim e when labor others have indicated, in other sectors as well, overall third-qu arter GDP barreled ahead at an estim ated annual rate of 4.8 percent that will pr obably be revised up. And the outlook, according both to Board staff and private for ecasters, is for continued very st rong growth that at this stage is probably above trend and m ay be slowing only gradually to trend. The m ajor new factors that em erged during th e period and that are a source of som e concern I think are both dom estic and inte rnation al. Dom estically, the pa ttern of  tight labor which had been stable at around the 4¼ percent leve l or m aybe a little lower, has clearly ticked down again. At the sam e time, the percent of th e population not in the labor  force who want jobs also has declined. The labor force participati on rate has rem ained in  a tight range around 67 percent since March 1998, which is quite unusua l I think in such a strong econom y. That suggests that perhaps the supply of available workers is indeed nearly exhausted, and this is occurring just as aggregate hours data show a c ontinuing uptrend. So ev en if the productivity trend is somewhat higher, I think there is a real risk that soon er rather than later wage dem ands Now, the tautness in the  labor m arket is con tinuing just as th e stre ngth of the rest of the world is becom ing a little cle arer. Karen Johnson is right to  caution u s that there are still some risks that there co uld be policy m istakes in som e places. Japan is certainly a q uestion. But overall, I believe it’s m ore likely that global he aling is actually becom ing a bit of a global recovery which, as som eone said earlier, is taki ng away one of the safe ty valves that could prevent a potential overheating of the U.S. economy. In fact, that global recovery m ay be adding a bit m ore fuel to the fire. I think exports ha ve probably turned the co rner and will, I believe, continue to press on dom estic reso urce utilization. Real exports gr ew at an annual rate of about 12.4 percen t in the third quarter, which is abou t three tim es the pace of the previous quarter. 11/16/99 38 And the final com ponent, which Mike Prell allu ded to in his rem arks, is that the IP picture seem s to be show ing st rength throughout the econom y. So in a world of stronger global includ ing so me early sig ns of  bottlen ecks. Bob Parry a lluded to the Pur chasing Mana gers’ survey, which did in fact show for both prices paid and f or delivery tim es the worst re lative perform ance in several years--s ince May of 1995, I believe. And while Bob is right to suggest that one survey does not necessarily present us  with a sm oking gun, I don’t think it’s appropriate to ignore bullets being put into the gun, if that’s what is happening. So taken altogether, it appears that we ha ve a tightening labor m arket, a firm ing of industrial an d extern al conditions,  and perhaps s ome early s igns of e merging bottlen ecks. And I think the risk, if anythi ng, is skewed even m ore strongly to  the upside. So, in m y view the choice between caution and optim ism is becom ing even m ore stark.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. We have a wealth of new and especially revised data to incorporate into our assessm ent of the outlook. On balance, the data suggest that both productive capacity and dem and are advancing m ore rapidly than  previously expected. The further upward revision of the estim ate of trend pr oductivity does translate, as reflected in the Greenbook, into a sligh tly more favorable inflation forecast over the n ext couple of y ears. That is, the tem porary disinflationary  force of higher productivity gr owth has been enhanced and renewed in this forecast. While this has take n some of the quantitative ed ge off the Greenbook inflation forecast, it has not change d the qualitative pictu re or the balance of risks, which in m y judgm ent definitively co ntinues to p oint toward an increase in core inflation over the f orecas t horizon. And I m ight note that if the Greenbook has lost some of its quan titative edge it hasn’t lost any of its rhetorical edge, arguing very forcefully that in flationary pressures are building. The key to inflation prospects is not how  fast supply or dem and is advancing but rather the degree of im balance today between supply and demand, particularly in the labor Greenbook forecast gro wth slows to  trend. There is som e discussion at several points in the Greenbook that growth is slowing to below trend and that pressu res in the labor m arkets are easing, but I do note that the unem ploym ent rate is 4.2 percent at the e nd of 2001. So that 0.1 percen tage p oint in crease in the unem ploym ent rate is not m uch of an easing in labor markets. 11/16/99 39 At any rate, my point is that  the slow down projected in the Greenbook only prevents the degree of labor m arket tightness from  becoming m ore acute. I agree with the staff that th is degree of labor m arket ti ghtness has prevailed for som e time and has been offset in recent years by a combination of favorable price shocks and the disinflationary effect of the si gnificant acceleration of productivity. But I think th e situation has changed in a very im portant way with respect to  the future. We already can see that overall inflation has increased significan tly this year. So we can look forward now to reinforcing developm ents instead of offsets. Rising inflation this year will reinforce the already tight labo r by the effect of higher health care expenses, a nd the pass-through of those costs to inflation will be reinforced by further in creases in im port price s. One of the most critical aspects of this proj ection of trend growth is  that at the end of the period--after which inflation has increased by perhaps as much  as ¾ percentage point--the degree of labor m arket tightness is the sam e as it was at the beginning of  the period. Inflation is rising just as fast at th e end as it was at the beginning, and it’s  hard to see how this process gets contained without inflation m oving above 3 percent in the period going beyond the forecast horizon. If I take one thing im portantly away f rom the Greenbook, it is that  it’s possible to be an optim ist about productivity and a pessim ist about inflation at the same tim e. I think that’s important to keep in m ind.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I wish to note that our governor is literally a one-handed econom ist. [Laught er] Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. By th is tim e of the m orning most of wha t needs to be said has already been said. But let me briefly summarize how I see the state of play and offer several comments that I hope m ight be useful as we m ove toward our policy formulation. It seem s clear that the econom y remains ve ry strong, with a lot of ongoing m omentum. True, we do see som e better defined indications  of slowing activity, with housing apparently topping out and quite possibly autos as well. Other air pockets m ay well appear, but the mom entum  remains im pressive. New jobs continue  to be created in substantial num ber, driving unem ployment down even further. Consum er sentim ent has rebounded from  its brief and 11/16/99 40 shallow dip. The stock m arket paused for a tim e, but recently the strength appears to be broadening and the m arket seem s to be m oving into a new up leg. Foreign econom ic growth looks both more solid and m ore rapid--possibly a very potent influence on our own outlook. The year 2000 is an election year and those are generally strong. Inflation rem ains quiescent. One should always look for signs of serious potential  weaknesses or a slowdo wn, but other than the ever-p resen t danger of shocks it’s hard to id entify very m any loom ing in the forecast period. In short, the risks seem  distinctly on the upside. My for mulation of the key question before  us is: How and when m ight today’s healthy strength deteriorate into  unhealthy overheating? And th e obvious second question to be addressed shortly is: What policy today is m ost likely to be beneficial a year from  now? Let m e make several quick observations. First of all, stronger world growth is highly desirable. However, it does com plicate our in flation outlook. A lower dollar, stronger export demand, and a higher level of world resource ut ilization all put new upward pressures on our price leve l. This is an importa nt reversal of the favorable disi nflationary im pact we got from  a weaker world in the past several years. Second, the baseline Greenbook forecast call s for som e tightening over th e forecast period bu t still p rojects a rising rate o f inflation th rough 2000. While a cas e can be m ade--but not by m e--that the rate of infla tion likely to be reached by th e fourth quarter of 2001 would still be within acceptable limits, I’m  concerned abou t what that ris ing trend m ight im ply for policy. This Comm ittee could be require d to m ake very strong tighteni ng m oves to counter it. Finally, there is the apparent ly strong growth in the rate of productivity improvem ent, the Chairm an’s second derivative. It has served  us wonderfully well. But going forward from here, what are the param eters of its likely im pact? At one end of the spectrum  the improvem ent could contin ue for som e period of  time, but as the Chairm an observed it will not do s o indefinitely, with overheating po tentially a subsequent condition. At the other end, w hile the probability m ay be low, it cou ld dis appear very soon and we could find o urselves scram bling to avoid the co nsequences. To m e perhaps the h ighest probab ility is th at the  rate of  chan ge will remain positive but will not be strong enough by its elf to hold off the cost increases resulting from  stronger world growth, the wealth effect, and ever tighter labor m arkets. And an earlier and stronger rise in prices could result. 11/16/99 41 At the last m eeting the Chairm an summarized  his analysis by observing that we are not far from  where we want to be  and we’re not behind the curve. I agree. But we may need to move further in order to be sure that we stay there. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. The regional econom y in the Ph iladelphia District co ntinues to grow. Labor m arkets are tight, yet there are few signs of any upwa rd trend in inflation despite rising raw m aterials prices. The outlook generally rem ains positive and there ha s been no basic change in recent m onths. One continue s to hear stories about innovati on, new ways of doing things that improve productivity. For exam ple, the Internet is likely to have a m ajor im pact on the way people buy all kinds of goods, from  food to auto mobiles. And while there are a number of exam ples that I could cite, given the hour I’ll sk ip that. But the bottom  line is that existing distribution networks are likely to  becom e less expensive over tim e as a result of all of this. Turning to the national econom y, de mand re mains strong. Resources are stretched, but productivity growth is also strong and infl ation rem ains benign despite repeated predictions to the con trary. The trad itional models ha ve no t held up and longer-term  inflationary expectations rem ain well anchored. What does th e future hold: More of the sam e or a less favorable m ix? Even if a less favorable m ix emerges, it is likely to em erge slowly. If more of the sam e emerges, then we can continue to ha ve the benefits of highe r growth without higher inflation. Vigilance and patience have m uch to offer in this situation. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. We h ave just cr eated another record. We are on tim e for coffee. [Coffee break] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s turn to Don Kohn for his report. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Based on the inform ation received si nce your last m eeting, most m arket observers have characterized your decisi on today on whether to raise rates or leave them  unchanged as  a “clos e call.” And in the inte rest rate future s market the odds on a 25 basis point policy firm ing at this m eeting are not far from 50-50. On one side, data related to costs and prices generally have continued to be favorable. Despite tautness in labor m arkets, nom inal wage and com pensation increases by  most m easures rem ained m ore moderate than m any had anticipated and betrayed few signs of a pickup. More over, revised NIP A data have bolstered 11/16/99 42 the case for accelerating productivity  that co uld keep inflation  pressures contained for a while. Taken together, this inform ation has led the staff to flatten slightly the trajectory of price acceleration in  the Greenb ook forecast. An altern ative simulation in the Greenbook suggests that even with an unchanged federal funds rate f or the next two yea rs, total CPI in flation would rem ain relatively damped by historic standards, probably at a little under 3 percent in 2001. Comm ittee m embers have often noted the difficulty of m aking preem ptive policy changes when they are unsure a bout the underlying rela tionships of the forecast. By leaving op en the possib ility that the NAIRU could be a lo t lower than the staf f has allowed for or that productivity is picking up faster, the inform ation becom ing available since the last m eeting m ight be seen as only accentu ating  uncertainty about key su pply relation ships. Either developm ent could allow the econom y to operate at or  below the current unem ploym ent rate for som e time without inflat ion rising. In such circum stances, tightening policy could well prove to be unnecessary or at least prem ature and could incu r costs for the U.S. econom y in the for m of fewer jobs and lower income and wealth for a time than it was capable of producing. If this were a serious concern, th e Comm ittee m ight well wa nt to await further inform ation about likely developm ents in costs and prices, and stand pat on policy, choosing alternative B. Judging from surveys of households and econom ists and from  the gap between nominal and inflation-indexed bonds, expecta tions  that inf lation will r emain contain ed are f irmly entrench ed. Survey measures of long-term  inflation expectat ions haven’t changed in several years despite wide variations in headline consum er inflation and occasional bond inflation expectations seem unlikely to in crease much in the n ear term  in a way that would m ake the subsequent disinflatio nary effort especially painful should it turn out that tightening policy at this meeting was in fact an appropriate step. On the other side, however, incom ing inform ation on econom ic activity and demand also continues to indicate th at the economy is growing at an unsustain able pace, in ex cess of the e xpansion of supply, as Mike discussed, further drawing down the pool of availab le work ers. In the Greenbook forecast, financial conditions already in  place are, in effect, suffi ciently  restric tive to bring the growth rates of supply and dem and roughl y into alignm ent. And they stay in approxim ate alignm ent over the next two years with only som e gentle nudging on the funds rate next year to counteract the effects of the upw ard drift of core inflation on real interest rates and th e strengthening of foreign econom ies. However, not only has this balancing of growth rates failed to occur yet, but the Comm ittee m ay see significan t risks th at it will not m aterialize and labor and Karen have m entioned several possibl e factors that m ight boost dem and. I’d like to highlight in addition what app ears to be a global shift toward m ore 11/16/99 43 accomm odative financial conditions, despite recent actions by  a num ber of central banks. In the United States, m ost cred it spreads are dow n som ewhat over recent months. A portion of this decline m ay reflect reduced concerns about potential problem s over the century date change, in which case it is only bringing forward by two m onths an anticipate d shift that would have o ccurred next January. But some of the narrowing seem s also to be related to greater optim ism about long-run prospects for businesses and the econom y. This sam e optim ism is reflected in the m ore ebullient inv estor attitudes in equity m arkets and the associated run-up in stock p rices in re cent weeks. The shift appears to be even m ore pronounced for m any foreign econom ies, judging from sharp increases in their stock prices and declines in em erging m arket debt spreads to levels predating the Russi an debt default. The interplay between improved econom ic perform ance and reduced financial headwinds m ay produce stronger glo bal growth than allowed for in our forecast. If so, pressures o n prices in the United States could com e not only from  accompanying greater resource utilization, but also from  a sharper declin e in the dollar as foreign prospects com e to seem  relatively m ore favorable and foreign dem ands on the world pool of savings strengthen. The sense that financial restraint on sp ending in the United States is easing might be one reason wh y the Committee would f avor a tighte ning of  polic y by 25 basis points, as in alternative C. Such a firm ing, by reducing the odds on more accomm odative financial conditions de veloping, would provide the Comm ittee with better a ssurance tha t at leas t the growth of  dem and will c ome into better balance with that of supply, though le aving the unem ploym ent rate at an unusually lo w level. In the past few y ears, th e Comm ittee often has been  willing to liv e with the risk and the fact of tightening U.S. labor m arkets. But it may see the situation  as som ewhat dif ferent a t this jun cture: The unemploym ent rate is already low er than it ha s been since the late 1960s . Decisions to rem ain asymm etric but not to tighten over ex tended periods in 1997 and 1998 were m ade against the background of c ontinuing moderation in infl ation. Today, growth in most broad price indexes has risen, while th e rate of increas e in core m easures has been flat, with the notable exception of  declining core CPI inflation. And, are con tributing to a p ickup in  pipeline price pressures. The cost of not tightening at this time  if a firm ing turns out to have been needed could be a further overshooti ng of the econom y beyond its long-run potential, and hence a larger or m ore prolonged and possibly more disruptive adjustm ent later. Equity prices m ay be a pa rticular risk in th is regard. The staf f forecast has equity p rices rem aining near cu rrent levels with n o near-term  change in policy, but if an absen ce of tightening is read as suggesting a significantly lower path of interest rates going forw ard, equity prices could strengthen 11/16/99 44 significantly, boosting consum ption and inve stment. If such an increase pushed the econom y further beyond its sustainable potential and equity prices f urther above their long-term  levels, it woul d distort resource a llocation and pose a greater th reat of macroec onom ic and f inancial ins tability whe n markets an d the econom y eventually adjusted. Century date change concerns should not prove a barrier to tightening policy at this meeting, if the Committee wis hed to tak e this step. To be sure, m arkets are still som ewhat skittish and illiquid, so th eir response to a tightening m ay be a bit more volatile and unpredictable than usua l, especially because it is not fully anticipated. In addition, deteriorating conditions between now and year-end remain a threat should  lender caution intensify or household dem ands for currency build by even more than depositories  have allowed for. But it is hard to see why a flight to safety and liquidity  would be triggered by a 25 basis point incre ase in the f ederal f unds rate, p articularly since it would be s een as th e last for the yea r--or why the effects of any su ch flight wo uld be m uch accentu ated if it occurred ag ainst the ba ckdrop of a slightly higher federal funds rate. With regard to the symmetry or asym metry of the directive, the Bluebook assum ed that under alternative B you woul d retain the existing asymm etry. While the Comm ittee m ight not see the inco ming evidence as jus tifying tighter policy, the further rise in labor u tilization presum ably would suggest continuing risks of future inflation and the potential need to tighten policy before too long. If the Comm ittee were concerned that a biased di rective--under either  alternative B or C--would add to volatility in  financial m arkets in the weeks leading up to the century date change, the announcem ent coul d also indicate that the Comm ittee was likely to postpone consid eration of action until next  year, given the special situation in the m arkets through year-end. Under altern ative C, th e Comm ittee’s c hoice of directive bias would depend importantly on whether you think that after tightening the risks were still pointed significantly toward higher inflation--e nough so to m ake added firm ing in the early p art of next year a realistic pos sibility. The Greenbook forecast m ight be seen as supporting a case for keeping a tightening bias under alternative C, especially if  the Comm ittee were in tent on acting preem ptively to truncate the rise in inflation in that projection. Indeed , the tighter policy alternative in the Greenbook suggests that 100 basis points of  tightening by the end of next year But, as noted, the Greenbook forecast depends importantly on the judgm ent that an unemploym ent rate in the 4 to 4½ percent range is deci dedly not consistent with stab le inf lation ove r tim e. If the Comm ittee had reason to question this judgm ent, or to believe it did not pose a pressing argum ent for substantial firm ing because of the possibility that p roductivity m ight continue to  accelerate b y more than in the s taff forecast,  it might view its  strateg y as having two stages. First, stabilize resource utiliza tion. Second, evaluate incom ing data for building 11/16/99 45 inflation pressures at the existing resour ce utiliza tion levels b efore tigh tening further. In this case, the Comm ittee m ight be  more agnostic about the am ount and timing of  addition al tigh tening a ctions, ju stifying a symm etric directive. By reducing uncertainty and sending a signal th at the Federal Reserve was a bit less concerned about inflation risk s, the symm etric directive would offset some of the effects on financial m arkets of the part ly unexpected tightening. But m arkets should not be greatly surprised by a symm etrical directive,  which could be read as implying that the Federal Reserve did  not n ecess arily s ee itself as m ost lik ely in the m iddle of a substantial upward movem ent in the federal funds rate. The yield curve and futures m arkets have a total of  only around 50 basis points of tightening built in. At the sam e time, the spread between no minal and indexed bonds  is in the neighborhood of only 2 percentage points.  Taken together, these suggest that investo rs do not see the s ame potential for rising inflation as the staff has forecast and anticipa te tha t relatively m odest tightening w ill be needed  to keep inf lation well contained. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions for Don?  If not, let m e get started. Some very interesting questions are bei ng raised around this table today and around a lot of other tables where I have participated in discussions during th e last m onth or two. What is com ing across is a quite rem arkable divergence of opinions. For exam ple, those around this table are, as a group, much m ore concerned about upside inflationary  pressures; and I m ust say that I’m  more comfortable being here than elsewhere. But when you sit around the Business Council table, they will tell you that their prici ng power is nonexistent, that their ability to offset cost increases has no lim it, that their margins ar e in reasonably good shape, and that  there just is no evidence of the inflationary pressures that a lot of us are talking about. The Business Round Table m embers gave m e the sam e story. The question is why people who are looking at the sam e elephant are viewing it in quite dram atically different ways. I believ e the r eason is that there is som ething funda mentally im portant going on in the econom y, and how one evaluates it is critical as to how one com es out in the end with respect to policy. My bottom  line for today, frankly, is that the benefits of m oving outweigh those of standing pat. However, I think the issue is very complex. First, on the side of those who are less inclined to move, there is growing e vidence that inte rest-sen sitive are as of the econo my are beginning to slow, at least at th e margin. Motor vehicles, which are a very big industry in a lot of areas around the country, were qu ite soft in October, and the Ch airman of General Motors said to me that he views the m arket for motor vehicles  as really quite weak. The calls that we m ade 11/16/99 46 to industry contacts concerning November sales indicate very little change from  the October data. So, as far as the first half of the m onth is concerned, there has been no evident rebound. I don’t know whether you’ve picked up the sam e thing, President Moskow , but that’s what our sources tell us. The housing m arket is a little m ore difficult to  assess. We all have seen a significant though they have backed off their recent highs. This afternoon the National Association of Hom ebuilders is going to put out their early Nove mber survey of builders; their num bers show some bounc e-back in housing sales currently and over the next six m onths. Conversely, a private surv ey of the larger builders that th e National Association of Hom ebuilders has m ade available to us shows that sales rem ained weak in October. We know th at the official num bers for Septem ber were dow n sharply--and probably in  a certain sense a lit tle noncredibly, since that som e general softening is occurring in the interest-sensitive areas of the econom y. That’s not saying they could not rebound. A re bound has happened before, and I think we have to wait and see what m aterializes. On the productivity side, the data if anyt hing continue to be strongly supportive of increasing rates of productivity ga ins. This m orning’s industrial  production index for the m onth of October, when put into productivity term s and extrapolated for the rest of the quarter, engenders a quarterly output per hour growth figure of 7.6 percent at an annual rate. Two of the months for the quarter are forecasts, but th e level in October is already hig h. I think all of  you have seen the note distri buted by Larry Slifm an on the productivity data updated  through th e third qu arter. We do not as yet hav e all the details because C ommerce has not put together the detailed tables that we need for the full com pilation of num bers that we usually send out. Nonetheless, it’s quite interesting that on th e product side the official num ber for nonfar m business productivity was up 2.9 percent in the third quarter from  the third quarter of last year. That’s obviously  a significant acceleration. From  the income side, reflecting the sharp widen ing in th e statis tical discrepancy over the last year, the num ber for the in crease in productivity  is 4.2 percent, year-over-year. In addition, if we recognize th at the conceptually consistent denom inator in the calculation of  business productivity s hould be the work hours reported in the household survey instead of th e establishm ent survey, the 4.2 percent num ber 11/16/99 47 from  the incom e side m oves up to 4.4 percent.  We need to keep in m ind that the household survey of hours worked is the only one that’s tr uly internally consistent  with the unemploym ent rate. Th is distinction is q uite im portant currentl y because, as I indicated at the last m eeting, we have a difference in excess of 50,000 a m onth in  the changes indicated  by the conceptually identical definitions of household nonfar m business versus payroll em ploym ent. As a result we are getting quite different estim ates of productiv ity. The official data indicate a 2.9 percent increase over the four quarters, but if we use the sam e conceptu al fram ework with a change in both the num erator and the denom inator, we en d up with 4.4 percent. So the choice that Comm erce m akes is at the low end of a range whose upper lim it is suggestive of far greater acceleration. It’s really quite in teresting to find that the escala tion of productivity is far more pronounced, in term s of i ts second derivative so to speak, if we use both the incom e side m easure of output and the household survey  measure of hours to m ake the calculations over the past several years--indeed, going back  into the 1980s. Just to give  you a case in point, the estim ate using the incom e side and household hours data f or the de cade of the 1980s indicates a productivity growth rate of onl y 1.1 percent. For the period from  the fourth quarter of 1997 to the third quarter of 1999, the num ber is 4½ percent, up m ore than 4 tim es. Cyclically adjusted, that num ber is only m arginally lower. So so mething profoundly im portant has happened here. And the question is how that  should be interpreted. One thing th at is im portant to in terpret is whether accelerating  productivity engenders a stab le eco nomic system. The answer is, in fact, that it does not, and it’s in this regard that accelerating productivity  exerts upward pressu re on real  long-term  rates. The reason is that if we get accelerating incom e-side or supp ly-side g rowth and the propensity to consum e out of the incom e engendered from that is unchanged, then ar ithmetically we end up with dem and equal to supply. The unem ployment rate does not change . The associated inflation pressures are nonexistent. But there is a probl em in the fact th at if productiv ity is accelerating and if it is presum ed that the und erlying cause o f that acceleration will change th e long-term  outlook for corpora te earnings a t any existing f ixed discoun t rate, the ex pecta tion of  higher e arnings will engender an increase in stock m arket wealth. And of necessity if  there is a wealth effect--and there is som e dispute about that between New Yo rk Bank and Board staff--we invariably will get 11/16/99 48 a decline in the propensity to sa ve out of incom e. So, we e nd up with the need to satisfy aggregate dem and in excess of dom estic supply. We have been m eeting that dem and in two ways. One is by increasing the share of imports relative to total dem and. Because of th e increased productivity an d its root cause, the uptrend in technology, we have had a m uch higher rate of expected earnings on new projects. Over the long run, the rise in expected earnings  has been a m ajor factor in facilitating the widening of our current account defi cit in that the latter  has been readily fina nced, as one can tell by the fact that the do llar hasn’t  gone anywhere. The net im port-e xport balance, o r the current account if you want to put it that way, has recently been adding close to a full percentage point to the aggregate supply available to satisfy dom estic dem and. Second, we have seen a continued work. Employers have been willing to hire th ese new workers even thoug h their productivity is somewhat less than th e average. The em ploym ent of these workers has added another ½ percentage point to GDP growth. That source of labor together with higher im ports is how the gap between aggregate dem and and a ggregate supply  has been  closed s tatistically in the  last several years. Clearly, neither of those adjustm ent processe s can continue. As a consequence, what we will be ending up with is dem and exceeding s upply or its equivalent, investm ent ex ante exceeding saving ex an te. The pressure to m ove i nvestm ent and saving to gether induces a rise in real long-term interest rates. The rise in long- term interest rates has been quite significant until very recently. Rates on U.S. Treasuries have risen som ewhat less th an a p ercentage po int sin ce before the A sian cr isis, but the sp read on BBB-ra ted obligations versus Treasuries has widened. And judging from  the rise in inflation rate expect ations, and at this point  I’m using the TIPS to measure inflation expectations, there has been a very substantial rise  in real BBB corporate yields, which are close to the averag e yiel d that most corporations have to pay. I think the process of restra int clearly has begun to work, as the behavior of housing and m otor vehicles suggests. The trouble is that the lags are i nvariably quite long, and we do not know how much long-term  rate tightening is requir ed to bring supply and dem and into balance. Since real rates have been rising for so long, the presum ption is that the adjustm ent process has been f airly well es tablis hed and the f act that the stock m arket is unchanged over the last six months is another indication that  the pressure is there. 11/16/99 49 The result of all of this is that we have a m arket that is adjus ting to what is essentia lly --I don ’t kno w what the word should  be--let’s call  it an “unbalanced” exp ansion th at is being engendered by accelerating productiv ity. The reason that this acceler ation creates im balances is basically because of the wealth e ffect. And to the extent that r eal long-term  rates are rising, the wealth effect increases are being n eutralized  or reduced and we are experiencing a slow adjustm ent process toward an equilibrium  or ba lance. We have never seen anything like that phenom enon in this century to the best of m y knowledge. It may have ha ppened in the previous century with the huge changes in technology that occurred a hundred and m ore years ago, but data that would enable us to evaluate what  was happening then are virtually nonexistent. The problem that I think we have in setting m onetary po licy is the relatio nship tha t was raised in a previous  meeting by Governor Gram lich, nam ely the relationship between short-term real rates and long-term  real rates. As be st I can tell, the gap between them  at this point, especially if we were to move  the funds rate up another 25 basi s points today, is not all that large. In oth er words, th ere is a sligh t upwar d tilt in the real yield curve but by no m eans one that would suggest an inflationary  imbalance that we would infer from  a very steep yield curve. We don’t have such a curve at this point. So I agree with the Vice Chai r. I don’t think we are behind the curve, and I don’t thi nk that the m arkets are saying th at we are. And indeed the implication of  the f orward m arkets is that they a nticipate only a very m odest increase in ra tes on our part, and they are looking at very  much the sam e sort of evidence. The bottom  line is that we really do not know  how this system  works. It’s clearly new. The old m odels just are not working. And the reasons they are not working are essentially that we have a rapidly changing structure whose param eters are very difficult to estim ate, and, therefore, w e have to depend in part on anecdotal  inform ation and in part on som e sort of risk evaluation. At this particular st age, if I were convinced that th e hourly earnings data we saw in the last em ploym ent report--like that 2.7 percent rate of increase  over the last three m onths--were real and if we were in a position to move in December, I would say that w e could take a chance and wait until our December m eeting. But that 2.7 per cent num ber as best I can judge is not real because if we adjust it fo r mix, it turn s out that th e figure is n ot 2.7 percent; it’s 4 p ercent. Now, 4 percent is not of great conse quence when productivity is as str ong as it is. When we  look at total com pensation per hour, the figures are closer  to 5 percent, but unit labor costs are not accelerating ; indeed, th ey are declin ing. 11/16/99 50 I do not th ink the issu e of import prices per se is o f huge consequence largely because we can explain the disinflation wholly in term s of the gross product that originates internally. Import prices do have an effect on dom estic prices but it is indirect. I’m not saying that there is no effect there. I’m just saying it’s tough to ev aluate. I’m  a little m ore concerned abo ut the p rice of oil. Even though it’s clearly in the long-term  intere st of the m ajor Gulf producers to keep the price down s o as to keep com petition f rom other sources down , we need to rem ember that they have very large oil reserves. And it’s quite easy to dem onstrate that  it is not in their long-term interest to allow the valu e of those re serves to de cline, which  is what th ey would do if there is a sharp increase in the price of oil in the short run owing to the loss of market share. The difficulty is that the G ulf producers also have very severe fiscal and debt problem s. There is always the inclination for OPEC producers to agree th at the price of W est Texas Inte rmediate should decline to, say, $18 a barrel and to agree that such a decline will happ en eventuall y. But isn’t it nice for now to get $ 25 a barr el! The revenue s are com ing in. The lon g run can wait un til mañana. And indeed there is a serious potenti al problem  here: Even though the im portance of oil in the U.S. econom y has gone down quite significantly as the importance of energy more generally has gone down as a share of the GDP, oil can still have a pot entially quite de stabilizing effect, especially on consum er confidence. In conclus ion, I think we  have a lo t of uncertain ties at this s tage and the b ottom  line is that as long as we have a continuing decline in the total num ber of people who are unemployed, including those not currently seek ing a job, that is telling us th at the growth of de mand exceeds the growth of supply. That gap between the two has not been closing. It has been open at this level now f or a quite sig nificant period of tim e. And while it showed early signs of narrowing last year, it has reopened. In my judgm ent, as long as we have this gap and we can’t m ove in of problem s when we m ove interest  rates up, but I think the risks cu rrently are less than usual. I would prefer to see somewhat gr eater anticipatio n of a tightening m ove in the financial m arkets, but I don’t think it is all th at critical a factor. As a consequence, let me just end by saying that I would like to  put on the table a 25 basis point increase today and a symm etric direct ive. The sy mmetry in this case is a lmost autom atic in  the sense th at we effectively are sayi ng that we are not go ing to m ove in Decem ber. Indeed, short of a very significant set of surprises, it’s just not credib le to me that we would risk 11/16/99 51 such comm otion so close to the ce ntury date change. Therefore, I would like your reactions to a 25 basis point m ove plus a shift to symm etry. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Mr. Chair man, I agree f ully with b oth the reasoning behind your recommendation and with the recommendation itself. I agree that we should increase the fund s rate by 25 basis poin ts. I think we must be symm etric or we will create uncertainty in financial m arkets during the e nd-of-the-year period, when  markets are always somewhat illiquid. Given the Y2K effect on year-end m arkets, it sim ply would not be good public policy for us to be creati ng confusion in that kind of situation. So “C” symm etric seem s to me exactly the right conclusion. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. I find going up 25 basis points and the symm etric directive acceptable. I think whether we m ove today or not is a close enough call that reasonable people can differ, and the difference is so little that what one prefers and what  one finds acceptable are fairly close together. I actually feel more strongly about the need for a symm etric directive. We have gone to extraordinary leng ths to try to get through the ye ar-end period and all this Y2K business. For us to hav e an asymmetric directiv e in the face of that w ould look as if the righ t hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing. I think we want to err on the side of calm ing strongly abo ut the symmetric directiv e and I find the 25 basis points accep table.

MR. JORDAN. I agree with your recomm enda tion on the funds rate and, of course, with the sy mmetric dir ectiv e. I was pleased to hear and interested in your analysis of how productivity  changes, es pecially in a positiv e direction, can h ave secondary effects if one puts that acceleration in to a larger gen eral equilibrium  context. I know the staff has been doing research on this. I have been reading som e of their work and I would encourage them to do m ore so that we can flesh that whole idea out m ore ful ly. It’s im portan t becau se I believe that it’s affecting not just the United States, but if we’re  lucky--and I think we all would hope it will turn out this way--the rest of the world m ay yet experience sim ilar kinds of things. And understanding how the wealth creat ing process affects both goods pric es and asset prices I think is going to be really im portant to us in the years ahead.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I support the recommendation. I’d like to offer two observations. First, in term s of low inflation ex pectations an d the lack of pricing power, that’s because the m arket trusts us to contain inflation. And, therefore, we can’t use those low inflation expectations as a good signal about when it m ight be ti me to m ove. If we star t to lose that trust, then we have gotten behind. But we haven’t lost  it and we’re not behind. Secondly, if  the data come in perfectly b enign, right down the cen ter of  the poin t forecas ts, it do esn’t really m atter whether we move today or not. It seem s to m e that what’s important  here is that we’ve position ed ourselve s sho uld we get d ata on th e high side, with greater s trength in a ctivity and inflationary pressures. If we don’t move now, th en the m arket could well say we’re frozen until the end of January. That would risk our getting behind. There’s plenty of room  for rates to go down should the data com e in on the soft side. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. I can accept your recomm endation, Mr. Chairm an. Although I think there is som e chance that this action m ay be unne cessary, I doubt it will be ha rmful. Let m e just reiterate m y own uncertainty about what the appr opria te model is in  this environm ent. It seem s to me that many of the conventi onal models that we’ve been looking at over the last several years have sim ply been wrong on the critical issu e of the acceleration of inflation. I think we need to bear that in m ind. An alternative explanation, undoubtedly also ov ersim plified, is that what we’ve seen in the last several years has been a series of  positive supply shocks, presum ably related to 11/16/99 53 productivity, that have given us m ore growth an d less inflation than we otherwise w ould have expected. It was just a move ment along the dem and curve. I don’t kno w whether this will continue. I’m not sure what the appropriate policy stance is in  this environm ent. I’ll go along with the recomm endation, but I th ink we are a bit at sea here.

MR. MOSKOW . Mr. Chairm an, I agree com pletely with your recomm endation. I think the risks of not m oving are m uch higher.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, this month we  once again face the issue of how much weight to pu t on a forecast of rising inflation, a forecast that so far has been on the high side compared with th e more favorable actual result s. When the October m eeting concluded, I was fairly confident that we would n eed to raise rates at this m eeting. However, the wage and price inflation data in the interm eeting period have been better certainly than I e xpected. As a result, I would prefer to leave the funds rate unchanged at the present tim e and to retain a bias toward a tighter policy. But I m ust adm it that if we do that, the s trong likelihood th at we will stand pat until at least m id-January m akes m e anxious, sin ce I do believe our next move will b e up. And that need could be com pelling before we feel  comfortable in m oving in the new year.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. I support your recommendations  of a 25 basis point increase and a symmetric d irective. Let me say one thing a bout process. At the Novem ber meeting Bill McDonough m entioned the awkward tim ing of our regular Decem ber m eeting and Bob Parry just intim ated a concern about that also. So, at som e point we  might look at the m eeting schedule. The late December m eeting doesn’t seem  to help us m uch and there m ight be a better 11/16/99 54 way to arrange our m eeting schedule so that we w ouldn’t be making policy for such a long period of tim e. I think that’s som ething that w hoever does the schedule m ight take into account. Let m e also comment on your econo mic model, which I liked because it’s a good way to tie together two im balances  that w e often talk about, th e labor m arket imbalance and the saving/investm ent imbalance. It strikes m e that there a re at least two im plica tions f rom that. One is that given the saving/investm ent im balan ce, there is a very na tural reason why we ought to look for increases in long-term interest rates even apart from wh at we do at this table. The Greenbook touched on this, and I think it’s som ething that w e ought to talk about m ore. The second is that tying together the two im balances m ay actually uncover a reason why we haven’t seen m ore inflation. There are two ways that  the s team can escape. Until n ow we’ve had a situation where the steam could com e out in a very  high level of im ports and trade deficit. As that becom es less true, we m ight have to worry ev en m ore about inflation. But going back to the issue on the table, I s upport your recomm endation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairm an, I can support your recomm endation for a ¼ point increase in the funds rate and I can accept you r recomm endat ion for a sy mmetric directiv e. The problem  I have is this: While I want to convey to the m arkets the view that there is little chance that we would m ake an addition al move between now and our February meeting, I don ’t particula rly want to con vey to the m arkets tha t we now feel that we’ve done as m uch as is necessa ry, that we’ve re balanced the  risks, and th at it’s just a s likely the reafter tha t rates will go down as go up. What I really want to avoid is tu rning a tightening into what appears to be an easing. We’ve had that problem  before. Now, I could m ake a case that it’s not that hard to convey what we actually m ean in our announcem ent. I could argue that we could go asymm etric and tell the m arket that asymm etry doesn’t m ean that during the period l eading up to  the cen tury date chang e we will tighten but tha t it ref lects a p olicy tilt th at would be in place there after. I can accept the symm etry, but I just want  to raise th e issue that we n eed to be careful about how we convey our m essage in the announcem ent. Now we’ve put added burden on the announcem ent, which is okay as long as we use it effectively. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairm an, I can s upport both halves of your recommendation. Let m e say just one thing about the symm etry. In a strategic sense I thin k it’s exactly the right 11/16/99 55 place to be b ecause I do think, for reasons that yo u and others have outlin ed, that there is a great deal of uncertainty about where policy is going to go next year. And I would prefer not to build in momentum in policy inadvertently by adopting asymm etric language that m ay have the effect of tying our hands. I think we  really need to wait and look at incom ing data, and I think symmetry is the right approach at this stage. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I agree with your recomme ndation for a 25 basis point increase and for symm etric directive language both because I thi nk it’s better to take th e cloud off the m arkets and also because I’m  not sure that move won’t be th e last in a series of ti ghtening actions. I feel rather symmetric m yself about where things will be around the m iddle or end of January. We had an estim ated GDP num ber in the la st quarter of 4.8 percent and we had an unem ployment rate of 4.1 percent and a labor productivity number of 4.2 percent. In view of those strong num bers on the real econom y, I would hope that in c onveying our policy decision to the public we will focus on inflation,  inflation in th e pipeline,  and lead ing indicators o f inflation. I would not want us to give th e impression that we’re trying to  slow the econom y down or that we don’t like these strong real growth rates. A lot of our critics really don’t m ind m uch what we do so long as they don’t think we’re doing it for the wrong reasons. And I tend to agree with that. So I w ould urge that the rh etoric be given som e consideration.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. A draft press stat ement is being distributed so that we can all look at it. As we agreed last tim e, it’s very diffi cult for us to write communiqués in these meetings. Experience with the G-7 and other gro ups, as I’ve told you before, suggests that if we take the writing of our statem ent overly seriously, we’re going to end up with two-thirds of our meeting spent on that task. So, while I’m  acutely  aware that there are ph rases o r sentences and perhaps even som e subs tance that each of you m ight modify s lightly, I would appreciate it if comments for any chan ges were limited to only thos e parts y ou find really unacceptable.

MR. MCTEER. This says that “the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further, a trend that m ust ev entually be contained….” I don’t think we ought to say th at. I think it ou ght to be  drawn down until ther e’s no  one lef t. 

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I understand the practical prob lem of achieving that, but it seem s to me that we just shouldn’t be saying that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Let me put it th is way. We’ve said this a num ber of times in the past, and this is essentially the language we’ve used. So we don’t want to convey something over and above what I think has been said  previously on this issue. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I’m conc erned about the th ird paragraph. It talks about slowing growth down toward trend and I th ink there is a reasonable prospect  that we m ight do that. But I heard concerns expressed around the table--and othe rs can speak for themselves--that that m ight not be sufficient to contain infl ation going forward, or that at least the risks would still be unbalanced and consistent with a likelihood that rates would have to rise more. So if we’re going to be symmetric, I don’t want to be so radically symm etric. The idea of being symm etric was to convey to the m arkets that we were unlik ely to m ove in the very near term , but this 11/16/99 57 wording conveys a different m essage. This sa ys we think we’re done tightening now. Okay, bond and stock m arkets, have a nice day!

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Mr. Chai rman, I like the presen tation as it exists. Let me say why. I think the second paragraph has to be in cluded because it does say that at a certain point we just run out  of resources and the likely re source that we’re going to run out of is availab le workers. I also sh are Bob McTeer ’s view. There was a fascinating article in last Sunday’s New York Tim es about mentally ch allenged people having jobs; I think that’s wonderful. But in the real world at a certain point, if this drawing down of the available pool of workers con tinues, we w ill run out of  workers, and I think this  paragr aph s tates it in a v ery sensible way. In the third paragraph there are som e good central banker words and the last words of the second line are “appears likely.”  We don’t m ake a theologically dogm atic statem ent. But what I like about it is that it says that we are in the growth business; we are in the business of allowing the Am erican econom y to grow  as fast as the supply side of the econom y makes possible. And I think that is som ething that we need to say.

MR. BOEHNE. Mr. Chairm an, if each of us sat down to write this s tatement, we undoubtedly would come up with som ewhat different language and som ewhat different emphases. But, frankly, while we ’d all do it a little differently, I think this is close enough that we ought to accept it and  move on to the next item on the agenda. It’s n ot only th e G-7 that has trouble doin g this. If yo u’ve been around this Co mmittee lon g enough, you know that we’ve tried at tim es in our pas t to edit draft language as a Comm ittee and I will te ll you that the effort is totally unproductive. I believe our attitude should be that this largely has to be left to the Chairm an. I do think we have to hav e som ething that is broad ly accep table, and in m y view this draft is in th at broad area of accepta bility and w e ought to g o with it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I hav e a great deal of sy mpathy for what President Boehne just said. I know rewriting by comm ittee is really hard to d o, having do ne it m ore th an once m yself on things of  less importance than th is statem ent. But I have two real concerns. First of all, I share Bob McTeer’s concern about using the pool of ava ilable workers as the proxim ate cause for this change. I think we could say som ething like, “a s a consequence, tighter policy is necessary if inflation ary im balances are to rem ain in check,”  etc. Secondly, I agree w ith Governor Meyer on the tim e frame issue. Certainly, the second sent ence in that paragraph says over the near term , but I think the first sentence is go ing to give the m arkets real reas on to re joice and tak e things to new heights over the next couple of months. Unless we can find some qualifying words in that sentence--and I don’t think “likely” does it--we’re going to have som e real issues in the m arkets. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairm an, I am sym pathe tic with m uch of what has been said around the table, particularly President McTee r’s views and those of Governor Meyer and Presiden t Minehan. But I rea lly do b elieve that Ed Boehne has it right, that we just cannot do this by Comm ittee. I hope you can find som e ways to m ake som e changes in this draf t that will accomm odate the views that are bein g expressed.  But, basically, I think we have to leave it to you after you hear what the rest of us have to say. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Let m e associate m yself with Mike Kelley’s and Ed Boehne’s comments. As you all know, I’ve been working hard with m any of you to think about how we can best do this. [Laughter] 11/16/99 59 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. This is not how to do it! 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. And this is not how to do it! In a m ore substantive way, I’ve read this four or f ive tim es as people have commented  on it, and without question there are words that one could change. The reality is that if we all try to change those words, we’d end up with gobbledygook. What we have now is a m essage that  is clear. We might not like every word, but it generally reflects what I heard as  we went around the table. In particu lar with re spect to the symmetry is sue, all it sa ys is th at we are going to focus over th e near term  on being symmetric. To m y mind that doesn’t say it’s all over. So I think both in  term s of process and in term s of substance, w e as a Comm ittee are m uch better o ff leaving th is statem ent pretty m uch as it is rathe r than trying to cha nge it. Perhaps the Chai rman will want to ed it it slightly he re or ther e, but I would be very cautious going down the path on which we seem  to be headed. I’ve spent the last interm eeting period trying to  think about a way to do this and this is not th e way to do it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Mr. Chairm an, I understand th e difficulty of trying to do som ething as a comm ittee, and ultim ately I think we do have  to defer to you on the language of this. But I do find the first sentence of th e third paragraph troublesom e. I think we could delete the sentence and just m odify the following sentence about the directive a nd symm etry, and we’d have it right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. I really agree with Ed Boehne ’s point, but I can’t resist! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. That’s the problem! 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. So, let me m ake a couple of constructive suggestions. One is with regard to that reference to the pool of  workers in the second paragraph. I would just drop that sentence. Whether we’ve said it before or not, I don’t think really matters; I don’t know why we’d want to raise it again. My only other comment is on the next  sentence, the first sentence of the next paragraph. I think there should be a wa y to qualify that phrase “appears likely” a bit so that the m arkets don’t get carried away. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s continue to go around. I have som e suggestions on how to resolve this issue. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. I yield. What’s your suggestion?  [Laughter] 11/16/99 60 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. First, let m e just s ay that I th ink the second paragraph is essential because it’s trying to convey a recogn ition that on the one hand the econom y is showing at least som e signs of slowing but that on the other hand the pool of available workers is being drawn down. And that is the m easure of the ga p between supply and demand. It’s the best measure we have and that’s what we’re hanging on. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairm an, m ay I? [Laughter] My objection has m ore to do with saying that the trend m ust be contained. If we just  referred to it as an uns ustainable trend, I think it would serve your purpose and be a little m ilder. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Well, an unsustainable trend is contained. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. The sentence as it is now im plies tha t we’re  going to s top this de cline in the poo l of available workers. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Oh no, the m arket is. Market forces--

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Well, it’s not  the market that is issuing this press r elease. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. This is an argum ent that the Chairm an has made very consistently and I happen to think he’s right. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I do, too. And we know it’s going to com e to an end. The process has lim its. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. It’s not so im portant whether we think he’s right or not, but he is the Chairm an of the Comm ittee. And if  som ething like this wer en’t in the statem ent, I think Lynn Fox would get 85 phone calls  in the first hour asking about the available pool of workers. Don’t we worry about that anymore?  I think we have to have this in here to be consistent w ith th e Chairm an’s recent speech es. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Well, I’m  not worried about any com parison with m y speeches. Does anyone else want to comment before I m ake this  great recommendation?  I think there ’s a leg itimate ques tion abou t the third parag raph becau se it’s a subs tantive issue.  The rest of the comments, I think, were m ore analytical. The alte rnative is to go b ack to som ething similar to ou r August release w ith so me mild editing. My sug gested langu age would read as follows: “Today’s increase in the federal funds rate , together with the policy actions in June and months, should m arkedly dim inish the risk of in flation going forward. As a consequence, the 11/16/99 61 directive the Federal Open Market Comm ittee adopt ed is sym metrical with regard to the outlook for policy over the near term .” 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL. That’s better. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. It would be better if you take out the “m arkedly.” 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. You better get rid of that. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Take  the “m arkedly” out. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. No, it’s the real interes t rate issue tha t I think is relevant. Listening to our discus sion, that strikes m e as an ade quate solution to the problem . So why don’t we do that? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Mr. Chairm an, could I m ake a m inor suggestion? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Certainly. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. You referred to the firm ing of  conditions in our financial markets “over recen t months,” and there’s been m uch discussio n about the slight easi ng recen tly. So if you changed that to “over the course of the year” or som ething like that, the wording m ight accord bette r with the f acts. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think that’s a reasonable suggestion. Okay, why don’t we substitu te that rewording for the third p aragraph?  Is th at satisfactory to everybod y? Not really! Let m e put it this way. By defin ition it can’t be satisfact ory to everybody, but we shouldn’t care. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. We shouldn’t have these drafts f loating around. I suppose we ought to turn them back in. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Throw them in the m iddle of the table! 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER( ?). Pass them to m e. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. The Board of Go vernors is going to ta ke a short recess and vote on a discount rate change . Luncheon is available. When we’re finished we’ll com e back into session. The FOMC m eeting will continue becau se Roger Ferguson has distribu ted a memo on disclosure issues for us to consid er. We’re obviously not going to com plete our discussion of this topic today, but I think it’s  not a bad idea to spe nd a little tim e on it. Remember, we’re assum ing that we’re not going to  make any policy m oves in Decem ber, so the resolu tion of  the dis closure issu es is r eally no t nec essary a t this tim e. But it is p robab ly worthwhile to try to m ake som e progress in resolving them . 11/16/99 62 [Lunch reces s] 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. If you don’t m ind, why don’t we get going even though we still have som e food to eat. Let m e start by saying that what we would like to di scuss in this part of the m eeting is the reac tion of the entire Comm ittee to the Nov ember 10th memo that cam e from me. I signed that m emo on behalf of the whol e Working Group on the Dire ctive and Disclosure Policy and it reflects a num ber of points of consensus in that group. There are a few points on which there were slight divergences within the Working Group itself, but on those points the memo m ay reflect broadly the view s of the Comm ittee as a whole. Let m e explain what I w ould like to try to do. As the Chairm an indicated, this will be the first chance we have to discuss these issues but not the last. So we should not necessarily look toward trying to reach a form al vote or anything of that sort to day. This is sim ply the first opportunity for the whole Comm ittee to look at what your Working Group has done and give u s some feedback. Secondly, there are som e elem ents in here  where we have draft language and, if possible, I would prefer not to fo cus on the details of the wording ju st yet. Let’s try to keep the conversation on a conceptual level for now. Thirdly, we have a num ber of points of agreem ent and then a few points on which there was not clear agreem ent a mong the m embers of the W orking Group. It would be helpful if you would just give a general sense of your  views on points 1 through 9 where there is agreem ent. But then if you will focus a bit more on the co mments about the word ing of the sentences for symm etry or asymm etry, which starts on page 4 of the m emo, that would be useful. Again, I’m  not talking about th e specific wording but the two concepts laid out. With that pream ble, let m e tell you where the consensus did em erge. I think there is a strong consensus in the Working Group that ther e be an immediate announcem ent after every FOMC m eeting, even if it’s rather perf unctory. That announcem ent woul d convey the Comm ittee’s basic thinking and would include som e expression a bout our views going forward; symmetry/asymm etry is the shorthand we’re using here. Secondly, there was a strong consensus that the FOMC should at every m eeting vote on both the intended fed funds rate and the symmetry or asymm etry, which is exactly wh at we do today. So, those points involve maintaining the status quo. The third point of agreem ent was that the operating paragraph should no longer co ntain any sentence referring to th e Comm ittee’s consensus about symm etry or 11/16/99 63 asymm etry. The theory in that cas e was that the operating paragraph is r eally m eant to direc t the Desk and its behavior during the interm eeting period; there is not hing specific in the symmetry/as ymm etry tha t is a clear directive to th e Desk, though it m ay provide context. The fourth point on which general co nsensus was reached, as of this m eeting of the Working Group anyway, was that after the FO MC’s vote a draft copy of the announcem ent would be passed out to the governors and presid ents, with an opportunity  for them  to offer substantive reactions. That is where we cam e out . We did decide th at we should not p ass out any draft announcem ents prior to the vote. The concern was that the focus of the vote on policy would then be m uch more heavily  weighted to the draft words as opposed to the actual substance of policy. And it seem ed as though the focus of  the voting should be policy and not the draft wording. The sixth point on which I think there was ag reem ent was that the directive should be shortened to elim inate any backward-looking m aterial describing recent  developm ents. The seventh issu e on which we reached agreem ent wa s that the directive sh ould continu e to be released on the Thursday  after the n ext FOMC m eeting and n ot ear lier. And I will tie that in with num ber eight, which is that the m inutes should also continue to be re leased on the Thursday after the n ext FOMC m eeting and no t earlier. The rationale there, just to be very clear, was twofold. One is just that the process of producing the m inutes is tim e consum ing, whi ch makes it very difficult actually to get the m inutes out  much earlier than we do now. Secondly, I think there was a strong sen se in our grou p that the Comm ittee sh ould speak o nce during a m eeting cycle, no t twice, and th ereby avo id having the C ommittee be too actively  engaged, if you will, in The ninth point of agreem ent was that there should be a clearer way of describing the Chairm an’s latitude to make interm eeting m oves. The theory we had, afte r discussing this with Virgil M attingly, was th at there was som e language that the C ommittee co uld adopt in its organizing m eeting in late January-early February every year that  would clearly outline what the Chairm an’s latitude is f or making interm eeting policy m oves. The reason this becom es important is that a num ber of people had looked to the symm etry or asymm etry of the language as giving som e guidance and latitude for the Chai rman to act on behalf of the Comm ittee, and we thought it was better to be clear about that authority. Again, there is som e suggested wording in the memo. 11/16/99 64 Now, the area where there was slight disa greem ent within the W orking Group was on how to describe our v iew of things going forw ard, if you will. Just to rem ind you, the curren t approach that we discussed afte r our vote today involves issuing a statem ent th at effectively talks about potential adjustm ents of policy during the interm eeting period. I think m ost, but not all, people in the group seem ed to feel that that  is probably not a good a pproach, though there are argum ents that perhaps it’s not so bad. But within the W orking Group we cam e up with two alternatives. One approach, and I’d like to focus on it at  the conceptual level as opposed to the wording, is to try to get the forward-looking el ements m uch more focused on what we have described as the balance of risks. The thinking behind that concept was that what the m arket really needs to know is what th e Committee’s concerns are or th e risks that the Comm ittee sees and what it will be looking at in the interm eeting period bu t without n ecessarily jum ping to policy im plication s. The second approach was that in fact we should proceed further and include a reference to the policy implications. The though t behind this concept wa s that to do anything other than that is to stop w ithout addressing the obvious quest ion of “so what? ” The policy implication is an issue w e should speak to directl y. Those issues are outlined on pages 4 and 5 of the m emo. Now, with that perhaps too long introducti on, w hat I’d like to do is to go around the table in the usual fashion and get reactions to the m emo, since I know you have all read it. On the points where there is consensus in our Working Group if you have a strong reason to disagree, that’s fine, please so indicate that. But more im portantly, indicate whether your general pref erence is toward ha ving the forward-looking elem ents of our  announcements tied more to providing a sense of the balance of ri sks or whether you would prefer som ething sim ilar to the cu rrent symm etry/asymm etry approach, which addresses possible adjustm ents in policy more explicitly. Those are the issues on wh ich the W orking Group needs som e guidance. Let m e mention one other process issue. We will take your guidance, obviously, and then go back and try to craft the appropriate wording. We have som e draft language in the memo, but I don’t want this discussion to becom e too heavily focused on the specific words we used, since we have plenty of tim e to continue  to work on the wording. But if we can get 11/16/99 65 guidance from you on whether or not we’ve ge nerally got the consensus right and how you would handle the future-looking elem ent, that would be m ost helpful. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You know what I think would be useful?  You have seven m embers on the W orking Group? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Yes, we have seven. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Since you’ve all thought about this, it m ight be helpful to hear from  the individual m embers about the re asons why they cam e to the views that they did. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I think that’s absolutely  fine. Why don’t we start with the one who is closest to m e, Mike Kelley, and th en we’ll go around the table to the others. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. I would welcom e an opportunity to review a little further the language that was suggested about the Chairm an’s latitude to act  between m eetings. I have no problem  with the substance of it, but I would like to work with the langu age a bit m ore. Concerning the wording in the announcem ent th at Roger referred to at the end of his remarks, I would strongly support alternative I--d escribing the balance of risks--because I think it’s appropr iately inf ormative and ac curate. And I like the fact that it avoids im plying in advance that a determ ination has been m ade by the Comm ittee to m ove one way or the other. We do not, in fact, m ake such a determ ination. We review the situ ation from  a zero base at each m eeting. So, in m y view, what appears in alternative I is the m ore appr opriate presentation of how the FOMC leaves each m eeting. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Okay. Larry Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I am not particularly wedded to  the language in either of the options. But I strongly prefer the spir it of the second option, which fo cuses on the policy im plications, and here is the reason. What is the tilt about?  What is the m arket tryin g to learn ab out?  Does the m arket say “You are our favorite forecasters and we want to know how you view the balance of risks in th e outlook so  we can thin k about the f orecast”?  Or does the m arket wan t to glean some infor mation about our  policy intentions? Now, we ca n leave it and just say w e’re goi ng to talk about the balance of risks, but then they will say that a balance of  risks toward  higher inflation m eans the Fed is m ore likely to tighten. There’s no great dam age in that; I’m  just saying they are going to infer that. We can’t hide it. Why would we want to hide that?  If we want to hide that, we shouldn’t get into the business of having a tilt at all. If we don’t want to hide it, then we can just be m ore transparent 11/16/99 66 about it and say here is what we think the balance of risks is and as a result of that w e think it’s more likely that rates will be rising rather than falling. The next question is: Can we  really  tie the ha nds of the FOMC with res pect to the future?  Of course not. I woul dn’t want to do that. We are not  tying anybody’s hands. At every meeting we sit down and we start from scratch making an assessm ent about the economy and the outlook. We do the best job we can at that m eeting. So the question is whether we also should provide som e honest assessm ent of how we are le aning in the future. That’s all we are doing, and we can do that every tim e. Is the m arket going to be m ore focused on th e policy decision at the n ext meeting if we talk about it in term s of a po licy leaning as opposed to talking about the balance of risks?  I can’t understand why. But if we’re concerned ab out that, why don’t we just comm unicate?  We can tell the m arket that we don’t vi ew this tilt as having any particular focus on the next m eeting. We are not saying that we prejudg ed that we are going to m ove and that’s why we have the tilt-­that we dec ided just no t to do it this tim e but will do it nex t time. We can tell the m arket tha t our three m eetin gs. Another factor that goes into m y thinking is that I believ e it’s much m ore dif ficult to convey why we m ight want to tighten than whether we m ight want to tighte n. There are a lot of nuances, a lot of different m odels, and a lot of di fferent perspectives around the table. So we might have more difficulty--though th is is probably a m inor thing--t alking about what exactly it is in the balance of risks that we’re w eighing. In the draft langua ge in the m emo we only have two things that drive our policy each tim e--the ris ks are weigh ted either to ward weakness in econom ic activity or toward higher inflation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Or balanced. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Or balanced. I think that’s a relatively m inor point. But what I didn’t like about the language was that it focused on the likelihood of a par ticular policy m ove. That is perhaps a little stronger than the language we ha ve been using. Instead of saying that in the future we’re  more like ly to tigh ten, n ow we sim ply say tha t we’re m ore likely to rais e rates than to lower rates. That’s a much softer way of conveying an asymmetry as opposed to saying we’re more like ly to raise ra tes than  to hold them  constant. 11/16/99 67 So I would have preferred to m arry the balance of risks and the likely direction of interest rates. I’d give a sim ple statem ent about the balance of risks and say that as a result it is more like ly that ra tes will ris e rather than f all or that those risks are balanced, with an equal likelihood that rates wi ll rise or fall. I’d go back to the sa me language that we have now in the direc tive, bu t prec ede tha t with a sentence on the balance of risks. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Bill Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I agree w ith Larry. I think th e focal point of the decisionm aking is the interest rate decis ion, the federal funds rate d ecision. There will b e many different views at any one tim e about why we converge on that particul ar decision, and trying to  explain the different nuances is not going to be helpful. However this com es out, it should never be viewed as a prediction o r forecast of what’s goin g to happen at the n ext meeting. The fact that it has had and value, that could m ean we should have acted right away. We shouldn’t want a high predictive value. I regard our aim  as trying to give a sense of di rection. I think it re ally is going to be easies t for u s to reach a consensus o n that if we focus entirely on a se nse of direction with respect to the policy instrum ent, the federal funds rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Mike Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . I was with the m ajority on this one. I liked a lternative I.  The problem  I had with alternative II, which is close to where we are today, is that phrase “possible need for an adjustm ent in the stance of policy.” It just g ives the im pressio n that it is more likely that we’re going to be m aking an adjustm ent in policy--that we are going to be changing rates-­than if we take a step back and talk just about th e balance of risks. So I like the balance of risks approach better. It appears less likely that we have our fi nger on the trigger a nd we’re ready to pull the trigger and m ake the m ove at the next meeting. So, I favor alternative I. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Bob Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I favored alternative II. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. As you can see, this was a well-m anaged group! 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. And it was for m any of the reasons that were m entioned by Larry and Bill. I saw it as th e alter native that would be consisten t with  the f ewest a ddition al sentences of explanation, which I viewed as a great virtue. And based on our experience today, I see that as a really big virtue for which to aim . Moreover, it  seem ed to m e that the most im portant point was 11/16/99 68 that the focus clearly be on the im plication s for policy. I think if we were som ewhat more explicit about that, over tim e our experience would be good in providing that inform ation. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Ned Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. You all are getting the im pression tha t this was a very divisive group. I would note to start with th at we did all agree on each of th e first nine point s. [Laughter] On the point where we had trouble, I’m  with the m ajority. I favor alternativ e I. I think the point about keeping the finger a little farther from  the trigger is a factor but, as several people mentioned, since the m arket knows how to read th ese statem ents, in the end there isn’t a whole lot of difference between  the tw o alternatives. I suppose I favor  alternativ e I becau se this sentence will usually be a part of a broader discussion about w hat we are up to and why--of the sort that we just talked about t oday. It strikes m e that when th ere is a choice in language, we at the Fed always go for the understated,  terse form  and I would like to con tinue in that tradition. There is s lightly less r isk of misleading people the fewer words we say. I like the understated approach and I would like to keep the distinct ion between how we see the balance of risks and what we are likely to do. So, I’m  more comfortable with  alternative I. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I was m ore comfortable with alte rnative  I as well f or the re asons that Ned Gr amlich has articula ted. I think th ere is a distinction between talking about potential unfolding macroeconom ic developmen ts and trying to link that too tightly to a certainty about them  and, therefore, the policy reaction. The experience we’ve ha d before suggests that m arkets often, or at least occasionally, are prone to over-interpret where we are. And I would like to give them  fewer words, if you will, with which to do that  and, as Ned said, move the fing er jus t a little bit away from the trigger even though it’s not completely aw ay. I think, as Larry has pointed out, that that m ovement away from  the trigger is very helpful. So we ended up with a preference for alte rnative I by a m argin of  4 to 3. I will s ay that a s we did this m any people sa id they could live with alternative I. Again, w ith regard to Ned’s point about th e group not being as divided as it might seem, our views weren’t held with such a hard and f ast force that individuals could never see moving to another option. So, that’s  where we were. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Could I ask a question? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Yes. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH. I’m confus ed on a point of fact. Is the proposal that, when we f inally d ecide on the words, there will be thre e available s tatem ents, a nd at the en d 11/16/99 69 of each m eeting we will choose either to use the statem ent that the risks are balanced o r that there is a likelihood of econom ic weakness or heightened inflati on pressures?  Is the proposal that one of those three statem ents will be m ade at the end of each m eeting without any additional prose? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I think the proposal on th e table is that o ne of those three statem ents will definitely be m ade after each m eeting. There m ay be a bit of addition al prose if we feel there should be more explanation as to why we voted in a certain way. But in term s of how we view the future, the intention of this working group was that th at one sentence would handle th e vast majority of the future statem ents. Now, we di d have one experience, which I think drove us a bit. That wa s in our October m eeting when we adopted asymm etry and had a follow-up sentence that suggested  a bit of a tim e fram e. There was a sense in our W orking Group that if things were very closely balanced  then we m ight need a follow-up sentence, and that’s always an option. But the expectation would be that this sentence would carry most of the inform ation on how we m ight weigh future develo pments. It was our hope--I don ’t know if we can achieve this or not--that we would end up wi th a situ ation  in which markets are le ss focused on future policy decisions and m uch more  focused on the existing policy decision. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Bill, I’m  not a m ember of the Working Group and I wasn’t in on the deliberations, but I have the susp icion that on e can figure out how all this happened. None of us likes the words “symm etry” or “asym metry” so, therefore, people start to think about what can we do in lieu of it. And we end up w ith symmetry/asymm etry, [laughter] or in this case, asymm etry/symm etry. What th is com es down to is m erely a choice of words, which convey the sam e notion. The issue basically is  whether we want to have a soft statem ent, which is a recognition in my judgm ent of the fact  that we really don’t know what our next m ove will be, o r whether we feel sufficiently confident to  have a forecast of what we are go ing to do. First of all, the differences between these two alte rnatives are not that big. The only issue I see here is that if we decide on alternative I, at a later date we can go to II. If we decide on alternative II, we can’t go back. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. I agree. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I would be a lit tle concerned about that because in a crazy way our experience over the last num ber of  years is that we seem ingly have understood what was going on in the econom y. We m ay not have understood it as well as we would have 11/16/99 70 liked, but we didn’t m ake any m ajor blunders in policy. We really were never far behind the curve. We really were n ever in a pos ition wh ere we were forecasting recessions that did not happen or vice versa. But that has not been the experien ce over the d ecade s. And I’m concerned that we m ay have the impression that we’re be tter than we are in  fact. I think having our finger off the trigg er or a b it removed f rom the trigge r, as Ned put it, is a m easure of  hum ility. And as Larry pointed out, the m arkets will read it anyway. I think that’s probably right. So I think the only question is whether we put m ore burden on them  to be certain and less on ourselves. I myself would prefer alternative I, but the argum ents Larry m ade are very form idable argum ents, I think. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Are there any other pe rspectives from  those on the Working Group?  I guess we will do this in th e usual way,  with a go-around. Jerry Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. As we saw in our actual de liberations ear lier toda y, we need to take into cons ideration the ris k that late r on down th e road with ne w inf ormation we will f ind out tha t we had the stance of policy calibrated wrong. Even if we take an action w ith the expectation of the risks being balanced in som e way, the costs of changing are not symm etrical. As we’ve seen very often, we find it relatively easi er to correct in one direction than the other.  In part that is because the pressure on us from  the outside is asymm etrical and always will be a symm etrical. That’s a risk that I don’t think it would be useful to put out in a press release. So I'm  a minimalist on this. The least we can say about it the better, since we are not going to be talking about this other risk of suddenly changing cour se when we get new inform ation and find out “oops,” we had it slightly wrong. So, saying some thing about the balance with respect to likely policy actions I think is going too far. Saying something about the bala nce of risks to the outlook for the econom y and inflation is the m ost that I would like to see us do at  this stage. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Al Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Roger, let m e first say that I com pliment your W orking Group. You took on a tough set of issues an d dealt with them  I think very forthrightly and got all of the significant issues on the table. Let m e make just a couple of comme nts about  the points of consensus. Generally I’m comfortable to one degree or another with all of them , and ve ry comfortable with the first one. On the fifth one, which recomm ends that we not ge t a draft statem ent in advance, I cam e into the meeting thinking I would like to have it in advance, but after the discussion today I won' t worry 11/16/99 71 about that. [Laughter] I guess the recommendation that I have serious rese rvations about is the ninth one, w hich involves the proposed change to  the Authorization for D omestic Open Market Operations. I hope it goes without saying that in  my mind the reservation is certainly not about Chairm an Greenspan or any other chairm an in pa rticular for that m atter, but about the crucial institutional relationship between the Chairm an and the Comm ittee. I can’t say this a bsolute ly, but to the best of m y knowledge  and that of staff m embers in Richm ond who have studied the history of the Comm ittee, I don’t think the FOMC has ever previ ously authorized the Chairm an to take po licy action s without prio r consultati on with the Co mmittee in a m anner that would be-­and this is the crucial pa rt--so explicit, so public and, in m y view at least, so perm anent as is suggested in this recomm endation. Instead, we have extended such latitude inform ally and internally and non-publicly. In my recollection in thinking back a bout it, the latitude has evolved over tim e with changes in our operating procedures , in the language of the directive, and as chairm en and m embers of the Co mmittee have com e and gone. I have two principal--and I think practical--conc erns about this. The first is that if we were to chan ge the Auth oriza tion language as reco mmended, we m ight get to a point in the future where the Comm ittee is not so comforta ble with giving som e future Chairm an this latitude. But if we had this language, it would be  very difficult to rem ove it because if we didn’t renew the A uthorization in its exis ting form, it w ould be like a vote of no confidence and alm ost a constitutional issue. So once we change th e language, I think it woul d be not im possible to reverse that decision but it would be very difficult. Secondly, it seem s to m e that doing this may expose the Chairm an to m ore political pressure. Under the existing approach the Chairm an is in a position where he can say, if pressure is put on h im: “I can’t do this by m yself ; I hav e to go back to the Committee.” He would lose a bit of that cover. That m ay not be such an im portant point. The first of  these two poin ts is rea lly the crucial one to m y mind. As I understand the ar gument in the m emo for doing this, it is that it is tied to tak ing the sym metry/asymm etry state ment out of the operating para graph. If that’s a problem , then put it back in th e operating paragraph. The lan guage of the m emorandum didn’t strike m e as indicating that rem oving it from  the operating paragraph was urgent or truly compelling--desirable but not absolutely necessary. As far as the choice between the language of the two alternatives is concerned, I suppose I could live with either but  I have a pretty strong preference for the second one. The use 11/16/99 72 of the word “possible” suggests to m e that the trigger isn’t fully cocked. The problem I have with the first option, looking at it as a whole, is that it alm ost fo rmalizes a simple Phillips curve tradeoff between inflation and a recession. It’s quite possible, of course--we only have to remember our experience not too m any years ago--t o have the risk of bot h higher inflation and a recess ion simultaneously. In such circum stances, I think this choice wo uld be prob lematic. We could change the language at that point, but after having argued a bout it for so m any years in so many different form s I would hope that we can make a decision and stick with it forever. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. You are an opti mistic m an! Cathy Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Actually, I find myself m ore in agreem ent with Al B roaddus on other points than on the f inal one he discussed just now. I think the W orking Group has done us a favor by de-linking the discussion of symm etry from  the implied authority of the Chairm an to change m onetary policy between  FOMC m eetings. My understanding is that the asymm etry phrase always has been interpreted as having two meanings. One is that it gives the C hairm an some latitud e and the s econd is th at it convey s some sense of our discuss ion of the balance of risks at the m eeting. It seem s to me that unlinking those two thi ngs is an obviously good thing to do. As for m aking the Chairm an’s authority explicit,  I disagree with Al. I think it’s better that it be explicit than not. It offers the Committee the opportunity to object becaus e it requires that the Comm ittee be consulted afterwards if the Chairman did not find it feasible to do so beforehand. And we do have an opportunity in our annual review process--though I can’t im agine it ever coming to that-- to renew this au thorization or not. It seem s to m e a lot better to hav e this spelled out rather than have the degr ee of confusion surrounding the m eaning of symmetry or asymm etry language I h ave seen in my experien ce sitting at this table. Often in the course of their comments on policy Committee m embers would give different interpretations of what they thought the symmetry or asymm etry phrase im plied for policy. So I thi nk it’s better to be explicit about this and give the Comm ittee an oppor tunity to say yes or no on an annual basis. As for the wording, I’m  drawn to alternative I because it is less explicit about possible policy adjustm ents. And I think the Chairm an has a good argum ent when he says we can go to alternative II if we find it necess ary, but we can’t  move back to “I” if we start with “II.” 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Ed Boehne, you were next. 11/16/99 73 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Thank you, Roger. I think that you and your colleagues on this Working Group have really done quite an extraordin ary job to m ove us this far and you are to be complimented. My comm ents are in tended within that overall fram ework. As for the two alternatives, I favor “I.” The main reason is that the finger ought to be a little further back from the trigger. Risks sometimes materialize and som etimes they don’t. When we add the policy side to our assessm ent of  the balance of risks, we’re really m aking a two-step s tatem ent whereas a des cription of the balance of risks m akes it a one-step statem ent. And it is easier to go from “I” to “II” if we want than to do the re verse. So I com e down for “I.” As for the proposed wording of paragraph 2 of the Authorization, as shown near the top of page 4, I think the Chairm an absolutely  has to have the authority to m ove between meetings in extraordinary circum stances. I don’t th ink that’s debatable. The world is not always predictable and I th ink the Chairm an simply has to have that author ity. It has been implicit in th e directive. In fact, we got in to this symmetry and asymm etry la nguage partially for that reason-­to try to fine-tune the extent of the authority that the Chairm an has between m eetings. So if we are going to m ake the adjustm ent and de-couple this  from  the directive itsel f, then I agree with Cathy that w e have to be clear about it and expressly state it. I do have som e concern about the precis e wording. I think it ought to be the Comm ittee autho rizing the C hairm an to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yor k, etc., etc. I don’t think we ought to be delegating authority direc tly to th e Federa l Reserv e Bank of New York and putting the Chairm an in a consultative position. But I agree with the basi c prem ise that the Chairm an ha s to have this authority; the precise wording is another issue. I have just one m ore comment, which relate s to the points of consensus, and I don’t feel strongly about it. Point two says that the FOMC’s vote at  every m eeting should encom pass both the intended federal funds rate and the symm etry or asymmetry. And point three says the operating paragraph no longer would  contain any sentence ref erring to th e Comm ittee’s consensus about symm etry or asymm etry. As I read it, on th e surface at least, that ap pears to b e an inconsistency. But I don’t feel strongly about that issue. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. Roger, I think Presid ent Boehne was just practicing law. It seem s ironi c that the General C ounsel woul d propose som ething different and I want to know why. 11/16/99 74 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I was actually pointing in the General C ounsel’s direction. I think it is im portant for everyone to know that the la nguage proposed is Virgil  Mattingly’s language. He can continue to work at it , if you think that’s appropriate. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Virgil, if I had known it was your language, I would not have questioned it. [Laughter] But I’d st ill like to hear your explanation. 

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY. What is involv ed here is the fact that o nly the Comm ittee can direct a Federal Reserve Bank to take action. What  the Chairm an’s authority derives from  is the ability to interpret that directi on. And that’s what this language is intended to address. I don’t think it’s possible for the Comm ittee to give to the Chairm an the authority to m ove monetary policy on his own. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. I withdraw m y suggestion on the words. My m ain point is the substantive issue that the Chairm an needs such au thority. 

[SECTION]

MR. MATTINGLY. The W orking Group did change the draft wording to say the New York Bank could adjust the rate but only with the approval of the Chai rman, instead of after consultation. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Okay, that’s fine. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I think Tom  Hoe nig was next. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Thank you. On the alternatives, I strongly prefer alternative I. In my view it’s m ore honest in the sense that we are balancing the risks. If we weren’t, we could take the action only at the tim e of the meeting. So I think it is the be tter way of expressing how we see the likelihood of developm ents in the future rather than implying that we have our finger on the trigger. So I strong ly prefer alternative I. In term s of the proposed am endm ent to para graph 2 of the Authorization, I welcom e it because the Chairm an’s authority to initiate a policy action betw een m eetings has been  a source of confusion in this Com mittee for as long as I’ve  been a participant in these m eetings. This defines and clarifies his authority  and his responsibility for consulting w ith the Comm ittee so we won’t differ on what we think we’ve done in adopting symmetry or asymm etry. I consider it a clarification. It puts some unde rstandable param eters around the Chairm an’s authority, which I think is a good idea. So I’m  in favor of that. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Gary Stern, I have you next on the list. 11/16/99 75 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. With regard to the alternat ives on symmetry or asymm etry, I strongly favor alternative I as well for the reas ons that the other advocates have cited. With regard to recomm endation num ber nine and the Chairm an’s au thority, I’m  in favor of som ething like what is proposed here. I’m willing to leave the de cision on the exact language to others, but I certainly f avor som ething like that. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Jack Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. In the interest of tim e, I’ll echo G ary Stern ’s comm ents. I also strongly prefer alternative I. I think there’s less chance of the statem ent being seen as a tentative policy decision. I, too, would like to see us be as explicit as possible in finding the right words for the Chair man’s authority. I would em phasize the des irability of  consu ltation with the f ull Comm ittee whenever feasible, and I would hope th at that would be the case in alm ost all instances. I, too, stum bled ove r the words about the New York Fed and consultation with the Chairm an. I hope we will look at th at som e more. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Bob McTeer is next. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I continue to think that the best thing for us to do is not to vote on a bias at the m eeting and, therefore, there won’t be one to report on. I think it creates too m any opportunities for us to be wrong, to com e up with a bias and then not follow through on it. Sometimes I worry that we m ight follow through on it because we had the bias in the first place. But the argum ent to so away with the bias st atem ent is obviously not going to go anywhere. So given the choice presented by the W orking Group, I find it a very close call. I guess I would go along with altern ative I, but would urge so me more thinking about the appropriate words to use. On the executi on of the Comm ittee’s policy decisions between meetings, if Al Broaddus and Virgil Mattingly could get together  and keep it legal I would hope that Al’s points could be taken into account. I agree with Jack Guynn on the desirability of consultation  with the Co mmittee. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Bill McDonough. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. First of all, I respect highly the ability of the General Cou nsel to p ractice law. But I think we  have to be careful that in the process of clarifying th e Chairm an’s authority we don’t ov erlook the fact that the C ommittee’s agent to carry out its responsibil ities is the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York or whichever R eserve Bank is selected at our annual organ ization al meeting. We wouldn’t wan t to be in a p osition 11/16/99 76 where we had the world going up for grabs and ha ve som ebody decide that  the Desk couldn’t do anything until it had talked to the Chairm an. The Desk obviously is not going to change the official fed funds rate, but surely it is going to provide the liquidity or drain liquidity if that’s necessary. And I think we have to be very care ful tha t the D esk’s au thority to do that is not placed in qu estion by an ything we d o to solve th is other prob lem. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Does it actually  say “in consultation with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York”? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. No, what it says is that the F ederal Reserve Bank of New York will consu lt with you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Does it say th e Federal Reserve Bank of New York? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. This draft says the Fe deral Reserve Bank of New York. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We can’t hav e that becau se we vote on th at every year. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. This would be voted on every year as well. The point is that both would be voted on annually. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. This would be voted on after we decide w hich Reserve Bank will ex ecute trans actions for the System  Open Market Account. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Yes, after we have decided that. This is written with the cur rent status quo in m ind, but if we voted to select a different Bank, then we would m ake a confor ming amendm ent in the Authorization. Bill, did you have a perspective on alternative I versus alternative I I? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. My m ain desire is that  we get away from  the business of looking at ourselves in  the m irror. Therefor e, I like the id ea that m ost of the tim e-­ideally all th e tim e--we would have  one of three psalm s. The 23rd psalm , my favorite, which starts out “The Lord is m y Shepherd,” ha s been around for 2,850 years and it has been doing a pretty good job. So I think if we have our own 22nd, 23rd, and 24th psalm s and the only thing we have to decide is which one we are going to use,  that will sup ply the ne eded inf ormation to the Fed watcher deciding that if we change this word or that co mma, there are grave market implications in that change. What I li ke m ost of all is the consistency. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I think Larry Meyer had another comm ent. 11/16/99 77 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I just had a comm ent on the Chairm an’s latitude. When Ed Boehne talked about it, the first thing he  said was som ething like: Of cour se, the C hairm an m ust have the authority to move in exceptiona l cases. I didn’t see anything here about “exceptional cases,” and that’s part of m y problem. If this were handed out  as a public statem ent, I think it would seem  to convey the notion that the Chairm an has m ore latitude than the m arket m ight have expected. There’s almost a sens e of encouragin g the Chairm an to review the data during the interm eeting period and to m ake adjustm ents as he sees fit. I don’t think that interp retation is something we want to encourage. Most decisions should be m ade in FOMC m eetings; th at’s the bes t place to make the m. In exceptional cases, though, it’s important for the Chairm an to have that authority. understood inside this organizati on, and I wouldn’t want to conve y an im pression outside that this latitude was for other than those exceptional cases. The other question is linked or de-linked, c oupled or de-coupled. It seem s to m e that this s tatem ent says any decis ion and  adjustm ent should reflect the Comm ittee’s dis cussion and linkage. If the Comm ittee’s vote was for symme try--if the C ommittee pu t out a s tatem ent that said th ere w as little chan ce that a m ove was goin g to be necessary--that doesn' t mean that a m ove couldn’t be m ade in exceptional cases . It just raises th e hurd le a bit higher than would otherwise be the case. Whereas if we thought it was m ore likely that the risks we re tilted toward higher inflation, there would be less of a hurdle for the data to push the Chairm an toward an interim adjustm ent. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Larry, could you clarify your  position ? Are you saying that th is paragraph should have stronger language? 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I read this change as alm ost an encouragem ent of m ore frequent interm eeting adjustm ents. I woul d prefer it to say  that the Committee app reciates that in rare cases th e Chairm an has the authority  to act on the Comm ittee’s behalf. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. All right. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Let m e say a couple of th ings. First, there is no intention to change our standard procedure. And when it co mes tim e to adopt som ething like this language, I think the m inutes should reflect th at this is not intended to expa nd or contract the authority the 11/16/99 78 Chairm an norm ally has. Secondly, Virgil and others  can look at this again and see if we can put more words around it to m ake sure it truly reflects the sense of the discussion here. Let m e tell you where I think we have co me out and what I would like the W orking Group to do. I have a sense that there was genera l agreem ent, since I heard very few exceptions, on the consensus points reached by o ur W orking Group. So I will assum e that we will keep those on the table as they are. I did hear som e questions or suggestions--though not significant changes- -on the langu age with resp ect to the Cha irman’s latitude. Virgil is here and he heard the comments too, so we can continue to work on that . But I think the sense of the discussion was that we don’t want to expand or contract the Chai rman’s authority and that we do want to keep the consultative process involved. We know we are looking for som e consistency of interpretation. And the f inal thi ng w as to m ake sure that we have som e sense of this being the exception and not the norm ; in no sense are we ar e encouraging the Chairm an to do things that currently are not encouraged. On the issue of how we t alk about th e future--for which we will us e the sh orthand “symm etry/asymm etry”--while a few people preferred alternative II, the  vast m ajority seem ed to prefer alternative I. Therefore, I would like the Working Group to go back and try to continue to polish those words and then present them  to th is Comm ittee. Depending on how quickly we can do that, we will dis tribute anoth er mem o, hope fully  in the up coming interm eeting interval, with the expec tation that a t the next m eeting the FOMC will m ake a f ormal decision to ado pt the recomm endations of the W orking Group. That w ould include a decision on the language, with the focus on alternative I as the general di rection. I think that’s where we are. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We got a lot m ore done on this than I expected. There are no other item s on the agenda except to conf irm the date of the next meeting, which is Tuesday, the 21st of December.
