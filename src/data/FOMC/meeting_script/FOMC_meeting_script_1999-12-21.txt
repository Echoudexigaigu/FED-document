CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good m orning, everyone. Would som ebody like to move approval of the m inutes for the Nove mber 16th meeting? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH . Move approval. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objec tion. Peter Fisher, you wanted to discuss the report of exam ination, I understand? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes. I wanted to elaborat e a little on Louise Rosem an’s mem o to Don Kohn a bout the un resolved d ifference b etween the internal accoun ting records o f the Accounting System  regarding the System ’s net interest accruals on foreign currency investm ents. I thought it would be helpful if I gave a couple m inutes of background, if you will bea r with m e. Last spring, as m embers of the Comm ittee w ill recall, we entered in to a s eries of transactions with the ES F to re-balan ce our eu ro and yen holdings so we could com e to a bette r split b oth in term s of total hold ings a nd the currency m ix. This involved a num ber of transfers of ownership of a se ries of investm ents and result ed in quite a significant am ount of accounting activity. In the c ourse of reviewing that, our own accounting staff identified an error that had been introdu ced in the prior year in our treatm ent of the prem ium on bonds held in the accrual accou nt, overs tating the accru al accoun t by about $5 m illion. In the course of co nfirm ing that, they identified an additional $26.6 m illion overstatem ent in the accrual acco unt for interest on foreig n curren cy investm ents. We have had a num ber of staff members working full tim e trying to trace th e source of that $26.6 m illion overstatem ent. They have worked back through th e reco rds to Decem ber 1994, before which detailed records at the transaction leve l just no longer exist due to  the routine and appropriate destruction of docum ents. The Board exam iners were at our Bank to conduct an exam ination of the System Open Market Account in Septem ber and Pri cewaterhouseCoopers also has looked over our methodology to try to trace th is overstatem ent back through tim e and find its sou rce. PricewaterhouseCoopers is confiden t that we have traced it back as far as we can. They 12/21/99 2 have tested our work papers and agree with our  conclusion that we sim ply can’t go back any further. There are tw o possible causes of  this overstatem ent that we have to confront. One is the diversion of funds a nd the ot her is error. Now, we cannot rule out the possibility of a diversion of funds. But people from  our own audit function and from  Pricewaterhouse-Coopers hav e reviewed the contro l procedures we’ve had in p lace for the last decade and are very com fortable with the conclusion that th ese control procedures are sufficiently robust that the likelihood of diversion is  remote. It cannot be ruled out, but for diversion to have occurred it would have had to involve the co llusion of m any people--j ust an extraordinary number of people--on several diffe rent staffs. If anything, our control procedur es run a little to the “b elt and suspend ers” direc tion in rega rd to control of the flow. So, there is reasonable confidence that no dive rsion of funds occurred. The much more likely cause is a simple accounting error.  The failure to cred it the accrual account when cash was received would have left this acco unt overs tated. But we  have worke d the accoun ting back as far as we can take it and cannot find the erroneous entry or entries. Dave Sheehy, the New York Fed’s General Auditor, and I are both looking into a funda mental reappraisal of our control pro cedures. We have introduced an additional mechanical check to m aintain detailed records of the accrual s tream  by instrum ent, so that when a final principal paym ent is received we  can trace the record a ll the way back on each instrum ent and double check the accounting. More fundam entally and m ore im portantly, what troubles us is how we could have gone for so m any years without scrubbing this ac count m ore vigorously. That is som ething we are looking into and we are going to be revising our control procedures--both the audit procedures and those in our own Markets Gr oup. The Board’s staff and our accounting function at the New York Fed have worked out  an accounting treatm ent to correct for both the $5 m illion and the $2 6.6 m illion errors. That involves red ucing the accrued in terest asset accoun t by the en tire $31.6 m illion, with an  offsetting reduction in in teres t income on foreign cur rency inves tments. We will m ake that  adju stment bef ore the end of  the year and spread it am ong all the Reserve Banks. Of course, for all of us w ith responsibilities f or SOMA this is an em barrassing, indeed hum bling, event. As a technical m atter, though, I understand that PricewaterhouseC oopers is comfortable with the conclusion of both our 12/21/99 3 accounting and audit function and the Board staf f that this is not a m aterial event for purposes of disclosure for any Reserve Bank. I would be happy to try to answer any questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Is there any evid ence of a surprising rise in standards of living of key people involved? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. No, there is not. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Has som ebody looked? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, we have looked into th at. Many of the staff people are still at the Bank, though others are not. But we have found nothing of that nature. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Were it an em bezzlem ent, prior to what p eriod would it have occurred? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. We only know that th e difference existed prio r to Decem ber 1994. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It could have b een any tim e prior to th at? Is there a beginning point, other than 1914? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. The details certainly don’t exist f or pre-December1994 records, so I don’t know how we could determ ine the beginnin g point--in 1973 or 1963 or where. Prior to 1994, the only interest incom e we were rece iving in that account was com ing from  the BIS, the Bundesbank, and the Bank of Japan. So the source of the income was official institutions. It was really a very sim ple accoun ting process to bring that incom e in at that point; the complexities have been introduced sinc e that tim e. So, as I say, Pricewaterh ouse-Coopers and our audit function are confident in  looking over the control procedures we have had in place that it’s im plausibl e that a diversion could have oc curred. But we cannot rule it out. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Othe r questions on this issue? Let us go forward to your regular report. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Turning to the packet of colored charts,1/ page 1 depicts the rates implied by forward rate agr eements. As you can see in the top panel, in the period since your last meeting forward rates rose steadily until the r elease of  the e mploym ent report on De cember 3rd when the and the forward rates cam e off a little. The rates then bounced backed up again on the release of retail sales data, reaching highs for the year. 1/ A copy of the m aterial used by Mr. Fisher is appended to the transcript. (Appendix 1) 12/21/99 4 In the m iddle panel you can see that euro forward rates continued to follow the movem ent in dollar forward ra tes. I think I ha ve been harping on this a ll year, but let m e say it one m ore tim e: To m e, the most unnerving thing in m arkets today is no t the state of equity m arkets, the dollar/yen relationship, or the weakness of the euro, but rather the extent to which Eu ropean in terest rates at the short end  follow the p eaks and valleys of U.S. forward rates. I find it, as I say, unnerving that those rates fall even as the ECB rais es rates and rise  when w e raise rates. It is rea lly very odd and hard to understand. In Japan, as you can see in the botto m panel, the forward rates backed up in m id-Novem ber. But this tim e the Nikkei was rallying and there was increasing anticipation of a strengthe ning recovery. By m id-Nove mber the 9-m onth forward 3-month rate, wh ich as of now covers the fourth quarter of next year, had doubled since October. But with the release of third-quarter GDP number s and the Tankan Survey, those rates began to wind down a bit. However, I should note that Bank of Japan officials have been candid, if m uted, in explaining th at they are beginning to look for an exit s trategy from their z ero interest rate policy, and that is seeping out into th e markets a b it. So there is s till a b it of lift in the J apanese forward rates. Turning to our extraordinary yea r-end operations, on the next page you can see that we have com pleted th e auctions of options on repos, with the final au ction held on Decem ber 1st. If you scan down the page in the colum ns labeled “total propositions,”  “bid-to-cover ra tio” and “awards/ stop-out rate,” you can see that thos e num bers were generally declining over the course of the auctions. In our view that reflected the fact that we did what we said we were going to do: W e tried to m eet dem and--m aybe not each and  every last b id, but th e serious bid s for these op tions. The one exception to  the gene ral declin e in th ese num bers was the last auction of the January 6 strip, as can be seen in the very bo ttom line. Total propositions  jumped up from  $36 billion in the prior week to $43 billion, the bid-to-cover ratio backed up, and th e stop-out rate backed up a little from  2½ to 4 basis points. I don’t w ant to m ake too m uch of that, but I think it reflects an epiphany of so mething going on in the m arkets. The closer we com e to the end of th e year, the m ore the anxieties and uncertainties seem  to be about the fi rst two weeks of Ja nuary--what will be on the other side of the g reat d ivide o f the m illennium --and les s about liquid ity in late Decem ber. That is p rogress at least in on e sense. Turning to the next page, in the top panel you can see the cumulative reserve drain from  currency in circ ulation. The two red dot-dash lines reflect the sam e projectio ns--labeled  “high” and “moderate”--I showed you last tim e. In the m iddle line I’ve  shown the actual experience to date 12/21/99 5 and our current projection. That cu rrent projection is running a little closer to the high end than to the low end of our previous range of projections. Most of this still refl ects growth in vault cash, although we do see som e outflows to m eet consum er demand that is higher than in prior years. We don’t know whether to  attribute that to Y2K or not, but we are beginning to see a little of the cash seeping out. In the m iddle panel are the New York Bank staff’s estim ates of free reserves or reserve needs thr ough year-end, includ ing yesterday’s operations but not yesterday’s actual perform ance. As you can see, this produces about a $42 billion need fr om here to year-end, not including whatever ex cess reserves we m ay need  to put in on the last day, which might be around $10 billion. So, from th is point to year-end in our current forecast it lo oks as if we will need to provide abo ut $52 billio n more. This past Au gust, I suggested to you that we m ight face reserv e needs from  then forward of about $100 bill ion, with a band of uncertainty of $100 billion--$50 billion on either side of  that estim ate. At that point in have purchased just und er $10 billio n outrigh t and have done $60 billion in term operations throu gh the tu rn of the year. So on the present course, dating back to August and adding in th e $50 billion for uncertainty, we are at about $120 billion. That’s roughly our estim ate of reserve needs from where we were in August through year-end. Looking toward the end of the year, some of the m arket estim ates of year-end financing for mortgage-backed collateral that we were hearing about--and we were calculating our selves--were com ing close to and sometimes over 7 percent, which is the strike price for our options. That began to catch our attention. After thinking about it, we executed two forward transactions for the turn-o f-the-year weekend. We thought we would take on in advance som e of th e mortgage-backed collateral that might be looking for financing over the century date change. Our reasoning w as as follow s: If it was going to be exercised as an option around the turn-of-the-year, we would have been taking it on anyway, so why not do it in advance?  Also, as we thought more about  it, we decided this would be an opportunity for pric e discovery both for us and for the Let m e take you through this bottom  panel on page 3, which repres ents a bit of the ev olution of estim ates of te rm financing. On the far left, you can see that the im plied turn -of-the-year repo rates from  our term operations on October 8th were about 7 to 7½ percent for Treasuries, 10 to 12 percent for agency securities, and 11½ to alm ost 14 percent for mortgage-backed securities. Now, I want to be clear that a lot of heroic assum ptions are built in here. Ther e were uncertainties abou t Comm ittee 12/21/99 6 policy and one had to make estim ates of where other financing rates would be. But these are fairly typical of  where m ost people in the market thought turn-of- the-year financing ra tes were, understanding they m ight be a little overstated. In the s econd colum n you c an see the com parable implied rates from  our longer-term  operations o n Decem ber 17th. The next tw o colum ns are the bid and offer rates taken off broker screens y esterday for Treasury and agency collateral. And o n the far rig ht are the rates, taking the high propos ition and the low proposition, in the two turn-of-the-year RPs we executed. Both came in a little lower than the rates on broker screens. The high  bid was 6.27 percent and the low bid was 4.5 percent on the first five-day RP  we did for the turn-of-the-year period; 6.38 and 5.25 percent were th e com parable rates on the second one. I think the tighten ing up in the second ope ration actually just reflected the m arket coming to a sense of the pricing. The low bidders in the first operation were wishful thinke rs, hoping financing would be that low. So, I view it as a sort of h ealthy bunching up. But looking at these rates again does suggest to m e that mo re of the uncertainty the m arket is pricing for is in the early days in January, not just th e centu ry rollov er date. Some of the assumptions we have been m aking are probably in error, in th at they at tribute m uch of the prem ium just to Dece mber 23rd; more of it is probably an uncertainty  prem ium for the in itial d ays in keep financing rates low on any one day in light of our operations, but it Finally, the last page depicts how the fed funds rate has traded since your last m eeting. The upper right section shows the m aintenance period surrounding Thanksgiving. In that peri od we had a slightly elevated funds rate as we faced pressu res typical of the turn of th e month and of Thanksgiving, especially when it co mes so close to the beginning of In the next m aintenance period, from Dece mber 2nd to 15th, we leaned rathe r heav ily in the d irection of generosity, with the 15th being the end of the m aintenance period and a tax paym ent date. We wanted to be very certain not to have firm  rates on th at day, which m ight set us up for the end of the year. So we were quite generous in providing excess reserves from  the early through the m iddle part  of the period. Then we worked down the period average excess to just $1.1 billion, as you can see, but that gave us som e soft rates over the last few days of the interval. That was intentional on our part. That is all I have to report. We conducted no foreign exchange operations in the period. I would be happy to answer any questions. 12/21/99 7

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions for Peter? 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I hav e one little question. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m sorry. We have not yet approved the Exam ination Report of the System  Open Mark et Account. That re quires a motion. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I move that we a pprove the SOMA Exa mination Report. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objection. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. You m entioned a couple of times, Peter, that you think anxieties about Y2K have shifted from  the actual turn-o f-the-year period of 12/31/99 to 1/1/00 to the first couple of weeks in January. Is there any thing more substantia l to it th an that? Are there particular concerns in the m arket?  I know there is a lot of concern, at least am ong some financial institutions I know of, about ha ving m ore liquidity than they want coming into the end of the year. Do you think that concern is going to disa ppear quickly at the beginning of  the year, or is there anything m ore to it than that? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. It may just be a relative issue in that anxieties a bout the last few days of the year, when people thought m arkets would b e most illiqu id, have gon e away. So relatively speaking, the state of anxiety, whatever  it may be, is now about the first ten days of January. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. It just got pushed out? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, it was just shifted out into th e new year. There are certainly a number of people who are m ore worried abou t the state of settlem ents and heavy volum e after an accumulation of slow days. If the w hole system  gets as sticky as molasses, the problem  is not going to be on January 3rd and 4th; it is going to be on the 6th or the 10th if everyone is being a little too cau tious. I think that is where a lot of anxieties are focused. There are a num ber of other m arkets  in the world where, notwithstanding when banks are closed for holidays, the authorities have not b een as vigilant as we have tried to be in making sure the banks do not de facto close dow n the m arkets. Some small non-euro European countries have allowe d their banks sim ply to declar e the first ten days not good value days f or foreign exchange transactions , for exam ple, even though the banks are going to be open. So their retail custom ers can wa lk in the door and take out m oney, but their corporate cu stom ers can’t get their foreign ex change trades settled. That’s the sort of  thing that is gnawing at confidence about those first ten days. 12/21/99 8

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. I move ap proval of the dom estic operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Without objectio n they are approved. Mike Prell and Karen Johnson. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. If I were to put the Greenbook in a seasonal nutshe ll, I suppose I would say that we’ve brought you tidings  of great joy, but m aybe not great comfort. In broad m acro term s, the econom y has been perform ing splendidly. Though we can’t be especially confident at this point, it looks as if real GDP growth in the current quarter will be close to 5 percent, at an annual rate. If so, 1999 would be the fourth year running of growth of 4 percent or more. With job gains still str ong, we’ve now enjoyed three straight years of average unem ploym ent rates below 5 percent. The chain index for GDP prices has increased less than 2 percent for four consecutive years. Moreover, the outlook as described in  our baseline forecast is alm ost as good. GDP growth is projected to fall a little short of the 4 percent remain near 4 percent and GDP price in creases below 2 percent. This is among the most upbeat forecasts for the U.S. econom y that you’ll find today. So, if we’re right, the basis for joy is pretty clear. You’ve entered Hum phrey-Hawkins heaven. Unfort unately, you haven’t been granted unconditional perm anent residency ther e, and this is where the comfort side of the story com es in. We believe that the econom y ma y be getting seriously overheated and in som e ways significantly distorted. This Comm ittee has, of course, announced its focus on the m ounting pressures in the labo r market as the most likely potential source of deteriorating inflation perform ance a nd thus cyclical instability. But, though there’s a near consensus am ong em ployers that qualified workers are terribly s carce, the official data actually show decelerating  wages. I’ll make just three quick comments on this dissonance. First, we co ntinue to think that th e wage deceleration this y ear owes consider ably to the down side surp rise in price inflation that occurred last year when oil prices plummeted; on this  view, this year’s pickup in prices should be showing through in wages over com ing quarters. Second, judging by the nonfarm  com pensati on figures--though not by the less inclus ive E CI--real wag es (deflated by product p rices) have b een 12/21/99 9 incre asing q uite subs tantially even th is year. But, third, none of the official pay series seem s equipped to  provide an accurate reading on labor costs in today’s world w here plai n vanilla wages are becom ing less important relative to m any other co mponents, including def erred--and less certain--compensation in the form  of stock and stock options. This latter point is underscored by the stream of stories about people passing up big salaries to go to young firm s offeri ng equity lottery tickets and about estab lished com panies restruc turing th emselves s o that they can com pete on those term s. This suggests that  the linkage between compensation changes and  price p ressures--never an especially tight and predictable one --has become even m ore problem atic. Given these vagaries of the wage picture and its interpretation, and on the thought that the proof of the in flation pudding m ight be in the eating, perhaps we should sim ply ask whethe r there’s any evidence that prices them selves are beg inning to accelerate . I would say that there is som e evidence, th ough it m ay not yet be com pelling. Certainly, we’ve seen an upturn in core PPI crude and interm ediate goods prices. At the sam e time, and he lping to explain th e acceleration of the PPI pipeline m easures, the prices of non-oil imports (ex com puters and semiconductors) have begun inching up as the dollar has stopped appreciating on a broad basis and as foreign econom ies have recovered. At the final goods and services level,  with som e greater firm ness in the monthly figures of late, the core CP I has edged a couple of tenths above its low on a twelve-m onth change basis. And, of course, as I’ve noted repeatedly, overall consum er prices have accelerated noticeably this y ear w ith the run -up in th e cost of crude oil, som ething that m ay provide som e momentum to inflation in the near term. One way in which that coul d occur is via expectations, and households’ short-term  inflation exp ectations do appear to have risen some this year. It might also be noted that the la test sem i-annual NAPM survey show ed purchasing m anagers expressing som ewhat greater concern about increasing costs and inflation in 2000. All of  this may well be s tretch ing the point statisti cally, but I think it’s worth sounding a note of caution th at strong productivity gains and intense competition--even accelera ting productivity and in tensifying competition- -do not by them selves ensure tha t there can b e no step-up in inflation. Unless supply is com pletely  elastic, which seem s unlikely in the short run, dem and can be come excessive. That, we fear, is th e current situat ion, with the rising stock m arket overrid ing the effects of m onetary tight ening. Once again in recen t week s, the m arket has defied our notions of valuation gravity by posting an 12/21/99 10 appreciable further advance. Moreover, it has done so in a way that seem s to highlight the risk that it will continue doing so. I refer to th e incr edible run-up in “tech” and e-commerce stocks , som e of which have entered the big-cap realm without ever earning a buck. To illus trate the specu lative chara cter of the m arket, le t me cite an excerp t from a recent IPO prosp ectus: “We incurred lo sses of $14.5 million in fiscal 1999 prim arily due to expansion of our operations, and we had an accum ulated deficit of $15.0 m illion as of July 31, 1999. We expect to continue to incur significant ...expenses, particularly as a result of expanding our direct sales force…. We do not expect to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitab ility and, therefore, w e expect to continue to incur ne t losses for at lea st the f oreseeable f uture. If we do achieve profitability, we m ay not be able to sustain it.” Based on these prospects, the VA Linux IPO recorded a first-day price gain of about 700 percent and has a m arket cap of roughly $9 billion. Not bad for a com pany that som e analysts say has no hold on any significant technology. The warning language I’ve just read  is at least an im prove ment in disclosure com pared to the classic prospectus of the South Sea Bubble era, in which som eone offer ed shares in “A com pany for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.” But, I wonder whether the spirit of the tim es isn’t becom ing si milar to that of the earlier period. Among other things, it  may be noteworthy that the tech stocks have done so well of late in th e face of rising intere st rates. Earlier this year, those stocks supposedly were  dam aged when rates rose, because, people said, quite logically, that the p resent v alues of their d istant e arning s were greatly affected by the rising disc ount factor. At this point, those same people are abandoning all efforts at fundam ental analysis and talking about m omentum  as the only thing that m atters. If this speculation were occurring on  a scale that wasn’t liftin g the overall m arket, it m ight be of concern only for the distortions in resource allocation it m ight be causing. But it has in fact been giving rise to significant gains in household wealth a nd thereby contributing to the rapid growth of consum er de mand--som ething ref lected in the inte rnal and external saving im balances that are m uch discussed in som e circles. Whether our assum ed 75 basis point in crease in the fed funds rate would be a sufficient shock to halt this financ ial locomotive is open  to question. A model simulation in the Greenbook gave some sense of what m ight happen if the stock m arket shrugge d off that further tightening and continued rising. But another factor that will help determ ine just how much policy  restrain t is needed is w hat happens in the rest of  the world econom y, and Karen has a few words to say about the risks in that regard. 12/21/99 11 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. In my rem arks I w ill first say a few words about the and then will review what we perceive to be som e of the risks confronting the global econom y. In October, the U.S. nominal tr ade deficit in goods and services reached $25. 9 billion, a n ew monthly record. Exports were ab out unchanged from  their level in the pr evious two months, as increased exports of industrial m aterials a bout offset decreased exports of machinery, including computers. The value of imports jum ped in machinery. The October num ber was very close to that em bedded in the Greenbook forecast. By them selves, these data su ggest a fourth-quarter outcom e of real net export s that is slightly weak er than in the Greenbook. However, in com bination with sm all adjustm ents to som e dom estic components of GDP in response to these data, th ey im ply little net chang e in our estim ate of current-quarter GDP growth. Once again we have slightly  revised upward our Greenbook projection f or real output growth abroad during 2000 and 2001. This brings the total revision for 2000 to a bout plus ¾ percentage point since outlook for the com ing two years rests in  part on the posi tive surprises in recen t months for econom ic activity during th is year for m ost regions of the world. It rests also on the like lihood that fiscal policy will be less contractionary in several regions wh ile m onetary policy rem ains generally accomm odative abro ad. The one m ajor excep tion to the gen erally b right picture I am  painting has been Japa n, where although we have revised upward our forecast for next year, pr ojected gro wth rem ains quite low, and we are som ewhat pessim istic. Together with the stronger view for the U. S. econom y that Mike just reviewed, th e staff forecast now calls for a substantially m ore robust global econom y over the com ing eight quarters than seem ed probable a year ago. One risk to this upbeat pict ure is that w e, and other forecasters, are still not f ully taking into accoun t the m utually  reinf orcing positiv e impulses that can be sh ared acro ss countries durin g a sim ultaneous expansion. We m ay be underestim ating the upward m omentum in individual countries that can com e from the interaction of im proved confidence, higher capacity  utilization, and wealth effects. For the global econom y, we m ay be fai ling to allow for generally stronger export dem and everywhere as spare capacity is re duced in m any econom ies at the sam e time. 12/21/99 12 One class of m arkets where earl y indications of such growing mom entum  might becom e evident is global non-oil commodity m arkets. As yet, we do not see an indication th at dem and is putting severe pressure on supply in those m arkets. W hile pr ices have begun rising, it is from previous ly very low lev els. Going f orward, we will n eed to p ay particular attention to those m arkets for signs of  incipient inflationary pressures. At the sam e time, we need to be open to the possibility that the factors cau sing accelerating productiv ity in the U. S. econom y are beginning to have sim ilar effects in other economies, especially the other industrial econom ies. In that event, the global econom y woul d be capable of faster growth without  inflation risk than was previously the case. Provided foreign officials do not unnece ssarily lim it output growth from achieving its new potential, such a de velopm ent could result in stronger demand for U.S. exports and m ore balanced growth in the global econom y. Such a scenario is one version of a so-called soft landing. It now seems very likely  that 2000 w ill see high er interes t rates and more profitable investm ent opportuni ties abroad that could decrease demand for U.S. assets and raise th e risk of downward pressure on the dollar. Such developm ents could in  turn cause disturbances in other global f inancial m arkets as well. However, f or the f irst tim e since the Asian crisis began in 1997, we need to be alert to the possibility of generalized global upside econom ic pressures and the challenges for policy that such a developm ent would pose.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions for ei ther of our colleagues? President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I want to ask Mike a question about the outlook for autom obile sales next year. The Greenbook projection f or sales of light vehicles is 1 6.6 m illion, and I am  sure you know  that the auto  com panies are es timating around 15.9 m illion. We had a sym posium  at our  Bank a few weeks ago with a group  of forecasters from  the region, and they  were coming in around that sam e level--15.9 o r 15.8 million even . I am just curious as to why the Greenbook is so  much higher than the consensus forecas t and the forecast o f the auto co mpanies the mselves at this point. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Well, no one has had a part icularly good track record on forecasting auto sales this year. Even the autom obile  manufacturers them selves, I think, have been quite su rprised by the high level of sales. Our forecast of overall ec onom ic activity is, as I suggested, in the upper brackets of forecasts th at one would find at this p oint and au to sales 12/21/99 13 are a cyclically sensit ive sector of the econom y. I think therein lies a very im portant elem ent of explanation. I don’t think there is m uch m ore that I can say on this. We consult a num ber of models, and they gi ve som ewhat different results  about the likely pattern of auto dem and over the next couple of years. But as we look back at recent experience--at how m uch s ales seem ed to be above reasonable trends in the past two or three years--we don’t see a com pelling case for a precipitous  decline from  here, especially  in a funda mentally strong econom ic environm ent. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mike, I thought the sec tion in the Greenbook on alternative simulations was particularly interesting, esp ecially the com parison be tween the baseline and the flat funds rate scenario. It seem s to m e, if one  com pares  the effects of monetary policy action s on in flation expectations in the econom y, that there is  a greater s ensitiv ity no w than basically saying that m arkets are learning and responding to policy actions. But what is a bit confusing is that there is also, I w ould a ssum e, considerable sensitivity to developm ents in equity m arkets as well. If one looks at  those two Greenbook altern atives, there is a big impact on expectations as a resu lt of the effect of a change in rates on equity prices. Could you talk a little about how expect ations enter into the m odel now  versus how they used to? Is the re a g reater sens itivity now to policy a ctions? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I’m not sure that I can provide a very good direct answer to the question of sensitivity to policy actions. We have looked to see whether the responses--in terms of long-term  rate move ments and so on- -to changes in the funds  rate are different now. I think there m ay be som e small amount of evidence su pporting that thesis. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. The m ost im portant cha nge in the m odel, rela tive to where it was a few years ago, is the reac tion of the economy and the agents in the econom y when we don’t tighten in a period when the econom y is strong. In that case, people think we have revised up our inflation target, whereas in th e past our m odel basically assum ed that all agents were backward-looking. People just l ooked at where inflation had been; and the way that m onetary policy influenced the inflati on outlook going forward was simply through its effect on aggregate demand. Now there is so me independent effect  through forward-looking expectations  that leads to  a more rapid adjustm ent of inflation expectations. I think that is the principal difference. In looking at the res ponse of the econom y to changes in the funds 12/21/99 14 rate, we were unable to convince ourselves that there had been a significant change in either the econom ic structure or the m odel’s response to  monetary policy at som e deeper level. But I think the way the model is no w construc ted does m ake it more sens itive to th e conduct of monetary policy. It wasn’t even a question that arose in our old MPS model. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I should say that one of  the nice  features of our model is the ability to change the expectations for mation mechanism s. And the one that we have used in doing these sim ulations is a very sim ple, s mall m odel that is supposed to capture the way people will react to a certain s et of variable s. It isn ’t a fully cons istent model of expecta tions in that we are not taking a full rational expectations kind of approac h. That would be another way of doing this. This is one of  the areas of active continuing research, and conceivably there could be som e changes in this sm all m odel in  the not-too-distant future that would perhaps enrich that a  bit. One of  the th ings th at we  have pointed out repeat edly in the presentation of our sim ulations is the differe nce in  the ef fect of  lower in terest rates versus higher stock prices for th e inflation o utcom e. That’s because the in terest rate chang e induced by monetary policy is affecting people’s inflati on ex pectations to  a grea ter de gree th an th e higher stock prices, even though th ey both create more aggregate dem and. So, this is one of the areas that I think we need to work on a bit further in an e ffort to come up with som ething that would b e a little m ore rea listic. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOC KTON. One other area where over time there has been som e structural change in the econom y that has te nded to increase the sensitivity  of output to interest rates has been through the increasing openness of the econom y and the exchange rate m echanism . 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mike, on the top of page  7 of the first part of the Greenbook, you say that you are expecting hours in the nonfar m sector to increase at a 2¼ percent rate this quarter. And you say that if we get nonfarm  productivity in creasing at a 3¼ percent rate we will get the 4.8 percent GDP fore cast. That doesn’t s eem to add up. Does that imply that ag ricultural produ ctivity is dec lining ? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. We have a governm ent sector  to account for and I think that is probably the--12/21/99 15 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The governm ent and household sectors overwhelm  it. Agricultural productivity is still accelera ting according to the da ta that we have. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Yes, that’s why I couldn’t figure out-­

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Although agricu ltural productivity m ight slum p if genetically modif ied organism s were m ade illeg al. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. On wage s, is there any way to sort out the forward-looking expectations effects from the backward-looking effects of recent  changes in the CPI, which I think you were using as a part  of your outlook for wages? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. I don’t think there is a part icularly good way. And I’m  not sure, in fact, whether in the real world we don’t have a mixture of both occurring. In a m echanical way we have cost of living adjustm ents in variou s contracts, so that  is clearly backward-looking. I would think that in m any infor mal wage adjustm ent system s people are looking at what has happened to the CPI over the past ye ar or som e other recent period to get a sense of what m ight be an appropriate wage increas e. In other instances, people m ay be m ore forward-looking and the question is how they sh ape those ex pectations. We have tried to capture that econom etrically in various ways by using lagged prices, survey m easures, and so on. I don’t think we can really  separate the two in a clear way. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. If you enter both th e Michig an Survey’s forward-loo king expectations  and lagged prices into a wa ge equation, typically  both will h ave som e explanatory power. Whether you re ally and truly have identified  those two separate effects, given their co-linearities, would be a tough call. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. As you know, we are getting s ome prelim inary evidence that the wealth effect may be larger than the 3 or 4 percent stem ming from  capital gains that basic distributed lagged econom etric analysis produces. As a general proposition is it tru e that because of the random  noise in the system  any very sign ificant reduced form type of calculation that you’re currently m aking to pick up the wealth  effect is bias ed downward by the nature of the c onstruction of the test? Or do you have ways to filter out whatever noise there m ay be to come up with  cleaner coefficients?  For exam ple, suppose that in the real world there is  an exact 10 percent coefficient and that if you could m easure it in every detail you would get that number. But to the extent there is random  noise in the data, of necessity the estim ated coeffi cient will be biased dow nward, and if there is enough 12/21/99 16 noise in the system , at the lim it it will go to zero. Do we have any sense, having looked only at one m ajor upswing in st ock prices to jud ge this, wh ether that 3 to 4 percent coefficient is realis tic? Do we have actual usef ul evidence in the other direction? In other words, in the few periods of really significant de clines in s tock prices is there any ev idence regarding the robustness of that coefficient? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. We have looked at how r obust those estim ates are, exam ining different estim ation periods and so on, and one would find some variation in that respect. On a priori grounds, on e might think that this  effect would not necessarily be perfectly stable over tim e as the dem ographic distribution of wealth changes. If more of the wealth was held by people with shorter expected re maining life spans and there was not a strong bequest m otive, one would think the coeffi cient would go up because peo ple would b e spending that wealth m ore quickly. If younge r people are getting wealthy and they spread the spending over a lifetim e, one  would expect the coefficient to go down. I think there are any num ber of reasons to expect that the coe fficient is not going to be perf ectly stable. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. I’m not even raising the issue of stability. I am raising stric tly the que stion of the size. It is perfectly possi ble to have all the things you are mentioning but for the bias to be there as a function of the data them selves. I’m just questioning whether or not--oth er than by disaggregating the data--we have any indication that we m ay be underestim ating that coefficient. If you disa ggregate the data, you clearly reduce the noise. That’s the purpose of disa ggregation. We have already started som e modest disaggregation and we see som e rather  startlingly different results. I was just curious as to  whether th ere was concern about that becau se if we are underestim ating that coefficient on both the upside and the downside,  it cou ld be more destab ilizing th an even the less-than-optim istic apprai sal of the overall outlook that you just gave. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. There is one piece of  evidence, though, suggesting that our estim ated wealth effect is not t oo far off base. And that is that  the d eclin e in the saving rate we have seen has been roughly consistent with  what the consum ption equation uses--that is, what a 3 to 4 cents on the dolla r wealth effect would suggest should be the case. You are absolutely r ight tha t the hard par t in estim ating these effects is that we kn ow we are estim ating u ltimately the  consum ption ef fect from changes in stock pr ices. Those are  very noisy. What people are really reacting to, in essence, is their percep tion of the persistence of 12/21/99 17 those sto ck prices. And what the distributed lag p icks up is th e fact that b ecause the d ata are noisy we do not see an immediate response to every m ovement in stock prices. That’s because m any people, in m aking th eir decis ions, are trying to determ ine how m uch of that move ment in stock prices is, in fact, going to persist and how  much is transitory. So the distributed lag would pick up sm aller coefficients , let’s say, of the effect of the stock price change in th e first quarter sim ply because m any people are un certain as to whether or n ot that ch ange will be pe rmanent or tran sitory. If they knew f or sure, the lag ged coef ficient would be biased down because they would, in f act, respond more strong ly to that m ovement in stock prices. In term s of the disaggregated data, we ha ve a lot of work yet to do. We have a variety of different data sets and p rojects that we are pursu ing to try to pin down better the size of this wealth effect. I would feel m ore comf ortable if  I saw m icro level eviden ce tha t supported our hypothesis that we are actually expe riencing a wealth effect  of the size that the tim e series eviden ce is pur porting to pick up. I say that because, as our colleagues in New York have pointed out, there is un certainty in these es timates for sure. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Have you tried at  all to capture pot ential stock price volatility as a factor th at would delay the sense of  persistenc e of the gains? Or is the period just too short to prov ide any useful insight? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I’ve asked our consum ption experts that question. They claim that there h as not been m uch success thus f ar in their ef fort to work the volatility in sto ck prices into those consumption f unctions. It may be a function of the fact that, when we are using the ag gregate tim e series data, we are as king far too m uch from  those data and m ore than they are going to be able to return. The m icro level evidence m ay provide som e better fix on that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Any further questions?  If not, who would like to start th e roundtable discussion ? President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, econom ic activity in the Twelf th District has continued to  expand rap idly in recent m onths , with the expans ion broad ly based ac ross major District states. Every m ajor sector in th e District added jobs in recent m onths, with construction posting som e of the largest gain s. And m anufacturing has been a new source of job growth in recent months despite a continu ed loss of aerospace jobs. A rebound is 12/21/99 18 particula rly evident f or manufacturers of high-tech equipm ent, who recently have benefited from  improved exports to Asian cou ntries that h ad suffered recession s in the 1997-19 98 period. High-tech firm s have created a lot of j obs and wealth recen tly in the Dis trict, especially in California. This  year a record-breaking am ount of venture capital has been invested in California firm s, particularly those in  the Bay Are a that are developing Internet applic ation s. Proceeds from  initia l public offering s also have s urged th is year, followin g moderate amounts of IPO activity in 1997 and 1998. The strong perform ance of tec hnology stocks is boosting spending not onl y in California but in other Di strict states as well. For exam ple, one of our directors reported that Ca lifornians are using their newfound riches to bid up the p rice of beach front real estate in Ha waii. Analysis done by our staff suggests that successful IPOs have made a large num ber of employees wealthy, at least on paper. More than 150,000 persons are em ployed in the roughl y 300 California- headquartered firm s that have m ade IPOs in the last three years. About 125,000 of these em ployees probably have received stock or stock options as part of their com pensation, giving them as a group about 15 percent ownership in their firm s. Given th e strong stock price performance this year, the aggregate market capitalization of th ese 300 firms recen tly ju mped to about $450 billion dollars. As a result, about 125,000 Californians ha ve seen the value of their stock or stock options jum p to an average level of more th an $300,000 per em ployee. Just as this newly created wealth is boosting dem and, especially in California, it is clear that a collapse in Turning to the nation al econom y, recent data continue to show  the rap id growth in econom ic activity and moderate inflation that we  have seen for four years now. These data serve to reinforce the im pressi on that the supply side of the econom y is expanding rapidly. Our forecast under an un changed federal funds ra te and flat stock m arket shows growth of just under 3¾ percent and 3½ percent resp ectively over the next two years. With regard to inflation, tight labor m arkets are expected to impart an upward trend to the ECI, which rises in our forecast to 4¼ percent by 2001. Howeve r, the accele ration of productivity in recent years can be expected to counteract part of this pressure on goods prices. Moreover, corporate profit margin s rem ain high, providing a further cushion between wages and prices. Balancing these fact ors, our staff forecast shows a slight upward 12/21/99 19 trend in core CPI from  2.1 percent this year to 2.3 and 2.4 percent in the next two years, considerably  below the forecast in th e Greenboo k constan t funds rate scenario. There are significant ris ks on both sides of  the forecas t. The evidence of a continuing supply shock represents  a downside risk for inflatio n. This shock has proven to be difficult to m odel, and inflation, once agai n, could com e in lower than expected. In addition, the possibility of a significant stock m arket corre ction cannot by any m eans be ruled out, and that also w ould reduce inflationary risks. However, labor market tightness could begin to show through to price inflation in a m ore dram atic way, as would be expected fro m historical experience. This risk is illustra ted ra ther forcefully by the Greenbook with its forecast that CPI inflation would rise to 3.2 pe rcent in 2001 with no further tightening of m onetary policy. The key policy issues ap pear to rem ain the sam e. Acceleratin g productivity and actual results for inflation sugge st room  for guarded optim ism, while labor m arket tightness implies problem s ahead for inflation. While I am  perhaps not as pessim istic as the Greenbook, I m ust adm it that it has shifted m y focus a bit tow ard the inflationary risks that we face with an unchang ed federal fu nds rate. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Incidentally, parenthetically, Pr esiden t Parry has suggested a disaggregation of th e wealth effect by regions. [Laughter] President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The underlying trends in the Tenth District econom y have not m aterially changed since our last m eeting. The econom y rem ains healthy, with m anufacturing actu ally showing som e continued rebound. I am hearing more comments throughout the District that higher interest rates ha ve slowed som e construction sectors, especially resi dential build ing. Growth in hom e sales in the Dis trict was abo ut 3 percent third quarter over third quarter this year  com pared with about 10 percent last year. At the sam e time, we are hearing fro m severa l of our business contac ts that inc reases in public work s constru ction such as ro ads--a ctually jails f or the most part-- are of fsetting the falloff in other construction. While private construction is slowing, manufacturing is continuing to show good signs of strength. Our Beigebook contacts reported high levels of capacity utilization last month. The recen tly released data on  third -quarter m anufacturing exports also showed continued improvem ent in foreign dem and fo r District factory goods. Based on reports 12/21/99 20 throughout the District, holiday shopping centers are quite busy; seasonal sales are very strong and m any retailers are reporting the best s eason that they have had in five years. While the num ber of business contacts report ing labor sho rtages incr eased slightly las t month, it was probably not a signif icant increas e. Moreover, most of the increas e came in the m anufac turing sector, which has been e xpanding production in the last couple of months. The District’s unem ployment rate is  about 3¼ percent. Except for New Mexico and W yoming, all District states have unem ployment rates below 3¼ percent, and som e are much below that. District contacts report that w age and price pressures rem ain subdued, however; that is no different from  what I have been hearing for som e time and have reported in past m eetings. Our energy sector h as actually streng thened with the increas e in prices and  there are some signs now of wells being uncapped but very  few new starts at this stage. The farm econom y rem ains funda mentally weak, although ther e is som e improve ment in cattle prices. But f or now that s ector will continu e to rely on tra nsfer paym ents f or its h ealth. Turning to the national econom y, my vi ew of the outlook has not changed funda mentally since the Nove mber FOMC m eeting. The econom y obviously continues to grow well, with few signs right now  of rising inflation. I expect econom ic growth to slow over the forecast horizon based on our actions earli er this year. And, frankly, I find it highly unlikely that with an unchanged funds rate we  would have growth in the 4 to 5 percent range as suggested by the Greenbook. My vi ew of the Greenbook right now is that it provides a reasonable descripti on of  the upside risks to the outlook rather than the most likely outcom e. In my mind the risks are balanced. We do ha ve upward pressures; there’s no question about it. But there are som e other factors, such as our last three funds rate increases, that I think need to play out. I agree with most people that core inflation is likely to rise to about 2¼ percent or that it will rise to a rate highe r than 2½ percent in 2001. So in that sense, I think we do have some time to look at how things deve lop in the near future. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. In recent reports from  directors, the focus has been as much on the outlook for the next y ear as it has on  curren t or recent cond itions, especially 12/21/99 21 among those people who indicated they were in their profit-planni ng cycles or putting together business plans. We questioned them about the specif ics they were putting in their business plans. One company that owns ne wspapers throughout the country said they expect ad revenue to be signifi cantly stronger in 2000 than in the current year. But they are budgeting a 10 percent increase in newsprint cost s and an 18 percent in crease in corporate-wide m edical costs. And they e xpec t the r ise in th eir tota l labor costs to be in the 6 to 7 percent range. A communications com pany reporte d what they refer to as an “explosion” of demand for communications equipm ent. Growth in data tran smissions is currently running 10 tim es that of voice transm issions, and for the year 2000 they are budgeting for a 40 percen t increase in fiber m ileage th at they ex pect to put in to place. Previo usly, for the current year they had expected a fourth-quart er slowdown in orders and shipm ents because of the so-called lockdow n effect. They said it did not occur. The quote is: “If there was a lockdown effect, it on ly delayed a fu rther acceleration in telecomm unications equipm ent shipm ents.” And they will b e watching f or ear ly signs to conf irm that next year. A com pany that basically m akes ite ms out of  specia lty m etals-- they sup ply the aerospace industry and the m edical profession--said it expects m ost of its growth in the next few years to  be in exports to Asia an d Europe. Some recent signs of such growth prov ed of interest compared to what they had been se eing over the last couple of years. A major supplier worldwide of safety equipment had an  abysm al summ er but reported that exports from  September to Novem ber were great a nd they do not believe the im provem ent was Y2K-related. They said that they had been concerned that the im prove ment could be a blip, but they don’t think so now. Their foreign orders were picking up nicely and they expect next year to be even better. The outlook for construction spending and employm ent in the region is reported to be one of continued strength but it invol ves m ostly public spending on the highway infrastructure and the kinds of projects that  Tom Hoenig also m entioned. It has been asserted by s ome of our contacts that the recen t leveling in res idential cons truction in th e region reflects the lack o f availa ble labor, not the increase in mort gage rates. They feel it is really a deferral of residential construction because workers are not available. In unionized activity, our contacts say boo ming nonresidential constructio n has reduced the pool of available residential construction workers. They  are sim ply being bid off to other kinds of 12/21/99 22 projects. We hear m ore reports of compan ies delaying or canceli ng expansion plans for warehouse facilities or f or other d istribution opera tions, m ainly because of the lack o f labor. We are told that som e fast food restaurants in central Ohio have now gone to a weekends-only policy because they sim ply do not have th e staff to operate in the m iddle of the week. A western Pennsylvania com pany that produces air curtains  reports that overall 1999 will be a record year. They are now  expecting the fourth quarter to be th e strongest s ingle quarter they have ever had; the strength is in both dom estic and foreign m arkets but the pickup has been in foreign m arkets recently. They think m ost of the growth in dem and that they are seeing stem s from retro-fi t projects, not new construction. Another company that is engaged in specia lty food processing and distribution said that they es timate their Decem ber sales w ill turn out to be 25 percen t abo ve las t share th at is from  the Internet h as accelerated d ramatically. In January of this year Internet sales were 2  percen t of catal og sales and in November they  were 10 percent. Their corporate sales--pastries and other p ackaged foods that I would ca ll luxury  food item s--rose 30 percent this year. Most of that is for gifts to em ployees , custom ers, and suppliers. In the steel sector, the orde rs for the first quarter ar e reported to be good. Price increases in the range of $10 to $20 a ton were put into effect in the fourth quarter. And price increases ranging from  $15 to $30 a ton have been announced for th e first half of the year; that w ould be about a 7 to 10 percent incr ease. If they  are fully implem ented--som e of them  don’t take effect until April 1st--that would leave the average level of steel prices about 5 percent below where they were a year  and a half ago in July of 1998. Export demand for plastic-m anufacturing equ ipment has recently p icked  up, and it is expected that dem and in 2000 will be stronger. Again, it is s aid that m ost of the growth in new orders is going to be from  foreign m arkets. They think Europe is picking up very nicely and are hopeful about Asia. In the spo rts and entertainm ent secto r, the average price of a ticket to an NBA gam e on opening day this year was up 11 percent vers us a year ago on opening day. The average ticket price for entertainm ent events this year  at Gund Arena in Cleveland--m ostly for m usic perform ances--was 10 percent above 1998. Finally, let m e cite one report on the labor 12/21/99 23 worker with a bachelor’s degree in biol ogy and with com puter proficiency was $90,000. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, I would like to say a few words about the directive when we get to that  later in the m eeting, so I’l l try to com pensate by being especially brief here. In any event, I don’t have any great insights on the econom ic outlook. In short, I don’t detect a lot of change in conditions either  in our District or in the national econom y since the Nove mber FOMC m eeting. Activity  in our region continued to advance at a solid pace in Novem ber and early Decem ber according to ou r contacts an d the surveys that we conduct. Consum er spe nding rem ains strong. Our retail contacts are looking for nom inal increases in sales over last year in  the range of 5 to 6 percent. Outside of the textile industry which, of course, is  still declining, m anufacturing continues to rebound. Prospects going forward look pretty good, with new orders rising in a large number of industries. There are a few signs of som e deceleration in  residential sales and construc tion in som e local m arkets, but the re is, of course, a lot of noise in the short-term housing data, especially at the re gional and local levels. Activ ity rem ains at a high level in any event. Labor m arkets are still very tight  in our area. We ha ve heard a few reports recen tly of quite sh arp wage increases in som e service industries, but increases in the manufacturing sector rem ain fairly moderate. And m any of our  business contacts continue to report a lack of pricing power. The sam e kind of story seem s to hold true  at the n ationa l level. As I see it, projections of a deceleration in  the g rowth of dem and continue to be pus hed forward not only by the Board’s staff but by other forecas ters as well. I think the con tinuing m omentum in consum er spending is part icularly striking, although not te rribly surprising, given strong growth in jobs and personal incom e. As I mentioned earlier, the Gr eenbook projects growth in hours worked at a 2¼ percent annual rate this quarter. It is hard to see how that kind of growth can be sustained without  at som e point generating inf lation and inflationary wage demands, es pecially if th e core CPI is acceleratin g as the Greenbook is projecting going forward. One final point of interest: A teenage daughter of one of our Baltim ore officers is reported to have been offered $250 to baby sit for a local dentist on New Year’s Eve. She 12/21/99 24 turned it down in order to go out with friends . We’re not sure what that im plies for the funds rate [laughter] but we stil l think the risks are on the upside  and that we m ay be at least a little behin d the curv e. We’re still working on it and we’ll let you know when we fi gure it out! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think you’ve st opped this m eeting cold! That’s a new statistic, which we had better absorb! President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairm an, I’m  not sure I want to follow that! And I would also like to res erve a little tim e for the la ter discuss ion, but I won’t trade away all of m y time. The beat goes on. Growth in our region re mains strong and relatively balanced, and our contacts across alm ost all of our geographic areas and indus tries are expecting more of the sam e in the period ahead. Consum er sp ending during the im portant Christm as buying season is now reported to be quite strong after a slow start prior to Thanksgiving. High-end items, including expensive jewelry, are reported to be hot. Big Box and other discounters are reporting sales increases of m ore than 5 pe rcent on a year-over-year basis. As has been the pattern in recen t years, sales at traditional departm ent sto res are not q uite as stron g. As I’ve repo rted at other recen t meetings, real estate activ ity in our region  has flattened no ticeab ly. While cu rrent inventories of unsold units are at reason able levels, one major builder in whose judgm ent I h ave a great deal of confidence to ld us recen tly th at he expects to begin to see the first signs of ove rbuilding in som e of our m arkets in com ing months. Manufacturing in the region continues to increas e at a m odest pace, excep t for apparel, which is experiencing a long secular decline. Our latest m anufacturing survey did suggest som e caution in investm ent spending plans in m anufacturing in com ing m onths. International trade from  our re gion continues to suffer from  the weak growth in Japan and Latin Am erica, which account for 10 percent an d 40 percent, respectivel y, of our region’s total exports. Our exam iners repo rt that loan growth, except fo r mortgages, continues to be strong. There is m ore evidence of credit quality problem s in health care lending, and substantial loan loss pro visions hav e been m ade by several o f our large lenders recen tly. It has also been suggested that after the year-e nd liquidity concerns ab ate, we could see a pop in investm ent and credit extensions as  that m oney is put back to work. 12/21/99 25 The m ajor threat to continuation of strong gr owth in our region is the availability of labor, which historically has been very depe ndent upon substantial in-m igration to support our above national trend growth. And the pool  of additional workers has dried up. The most notable price pressure points rem ain the same: health care, pharm aceuticals, an d som e commoditie s. At the natio nal lev el, I continue to b e am azed at the raw strength of the continued expansion. Clearly, the consumption num bers and the anecdotal inform ation indicate that the econom y is carrying significant mom entum  into the first quarter. Like the Greenbook, both our jud gmental and  our VAR model forecas ts show some slowing in  the com ing year-­for so mewh at different reasons--but upside surprises have becom e the norm . While we m ay have som e unusual patterns over the Y2K y ear-end period, there now appears to be enough mom entum and perhaps pent-up investm ent sp ending to counter the early 2000 slowing we expected earlier. If anythi ng, the econom y looks even m ore resource constrained now on the labor side and is likely on a unsustainable growth path re gardless of one’s views of productivity and the NAIRU. Moreover, there ar e few signs that our previous rate hikes have yet begun to bite except for the mode ration in housing. As ot hers have suggested, higher real rates m ay be necessary to get a com parable degree of m onetary restrain t in the current environm ent. Like the Greenbook, our inflation forecast shows som e gradual rise in m easured inflation in 2000 and beyond. Like others, I find myself re-ca librating my expectations for productivity gains and reassessi ng other developm ents such as expanded world trade and its implications for the supply side and for pric ing power. While I am  comfortable building into m y outlook and policy thinking som e new views about sustainabl e increases in the potential for the econom y to grow, I am  not co mfortable betting that all of  the new-era phenom ena are everlasting. Were it not for the special year-end considerations this year, I would be trying to develop the case more fu lly this m orning for another snugging policy move. In my view, such a m ove would improve our chances of staying ahead of unsustainable developm ents that could threaten  our gains against inflation and lead to a deterioration in inflation expect ations.

MR. BOEHNE. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The regional econom y in the Philadelphia District continues to operate at high levels, with  a general sense that the good times will ro ll on. Retail sales are ro bust th rough out the Dis trict. Some high-end car dealers are h aving trouble getting deliveries, not because the m anufacturers can’t prod uce the cars but because there aren ’t enough truckers and trucks to get the cars to the custom er. Hom e sales are unusually brisk for Decem ber, in  part, realto rs say, because of the unusually mild weather. In comm ercial real estate , the demand for properties is strong, and I am hearing reports here and there of some speculative building; it’s not a lot, but I haven’t heard m uch about speculative build ing for a number of years. Labor m arkets are very tight. We hear of som e exam ples of large increas es in com pensation and special perks, but the general pattern is still one of m odest gains. The report from  bankers around the District is that they believe th at Y2 K will be a non-event. They have lots of cash in their vaults but few custom ers requesting unusua lly large withdrawals. The national econom y is clearly show ing strong dem and growth, with pressures evident on the supply side even with outsized productivity gains, and still generally benign inflation. Some further increase s in interest rates to tem per dem and growth are highly likely as the new year unfolds. Our prim ary objectiv e during the com ing weeks, however, is to get into the new year with financial m arkets as set tled as we can m ake the m. We have gone to a lot of effort to do just that, and our decisions to day should be consistent with those efforts.

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an. New England continues its recent pattern of moderate growth, at  least as m easured by the increase in em ploym ent levels, which have been a full percentage point below the nation for som e time. For m ost of the region, how ever, labor force growth has also been  slower. And it has been slower than the growth in the num ber of jobs, wh ich is giving rise to declining rates of unem ploym ent in all states in the region. This also gives credence to the num erous anecdotes that it is the labor constra int itself  that is p reventing higher rates of  regional job growth. Nonetheless, the region’s employm ent growth does exceed th e nation’s in two  areas --cons truction job increases and the m oderation in manufacturing job losses. In the construction area, job growth re flects very good residential and commercial real estate markets in Bo ston and els ewhere.  We continue to ask ourselves whether 12/21/99 27 construction job growth could be a precursor to a 1980s type real  estate boom . But so far, construction jobs do not com prise nearly as large a fraction o f total em ploym ent as they did in the 1980s, and there is very little, t hough som e, speculative construction going on. On the m anufacturing side, regional job lo sses are m ore m oderate than th ose for the nation as a whole, prob ably reflecting a turnar ound in m erchandise exp orts. Recen t reports indicate th at new orders for manufac turing goods in the regio n accelerated in recent months, led by a rebound in exports. Year over year  New England exports grew fastest to South Korea, Mexico, and the Netherlands,  though exp orts to Sou th Korea are s till no t back to pre-crisis levels. As com pared with ear lier this y ear, c ontacts note d a som ewhat inc reased willingn ess to pay higher wages and to raise prices, at least for retail goo ds. Consumer confidence is high and growing, with surveys pointing to esp ecially strong gains in expectations about future econo mic conditio ns. This is in m arked contras t to earlier this ye ar when such expectations were m ore moderate. To the exte nt that exp ectations were af fected earlier by Y2K uncertainties--and I am  not really positive th at they were--the apparent lack of concern in this are a may be f eeding into h igher lev els of consum er confidence. It is hard to find any Y2K panic or even deep worries ou t there, and believe m e we’ve tried to find it. In looking around for signs of slowing in the region, I m ust adm it I’ve had a hard time finding any. Bankers do report that m ortgage  originations are off. And while loans in general have been growing at a better pace than earl ier this year, they are rising at only about half th e pace for th e nation as a whol e. Aside from  that, however, just about everything else seem s to be going great. Stores are packed. The highways  are jamm ed. Help in re tail stor es is ex tremely hard  to com e by. We held a series of bankers’ forum s this fall and the conversations am ong those presen t as well as am ong the bankers on our board were very upbeat. New England m ay be growin g more slowly than the nation, at least as measured by overall em ploym ent, but our regional econom y seems to have a very solid foundation for the foreseeable future. Turning to the nation, I am  struck, as others  have been, by the fact that even in the few weeks since th e last meeting thin gs seem  to have gotten that m uch hotter in the overall econom y. Growth this quarter will  be som ewhere close to 5 per cent. Labor m arkets are, if anything, tighter. The stock m arket continue s to surprise on the upside, and financial 12/21/99 28 tightening. Foreign growth, despite the weakne ss in Japan, continues to be stronger than expected. And reflecting all of this, oil and other commodity prices continue on the upswing. True, there seem to be a few signs at  the national level of slowing in interest-sensitive sectors; but we have seen th ese signs b efore and th ey’ve sim ply been pauses. On the broad wage and price front, the tota l CPI has leveled off and the core is rising to fill the gap between th e two of them. The one thing th at rem ains som ewhat puzzling, to me anyway, is why, given labor m arket pressu res, we haven’t seen m uch escalation in overall wages and in fact actually have seen so me reduction in the rate of growth. If one believ es that is becaus e overall prices  were lowe r last y ear due to the impact of declin ing oil prices, then I think ther e is rea son to assu me that the rev erse will happen in the com ing months and we will begin to see m ore wage press ures. One h as to rem ain agnostic because we have exp ected to see that for som e time now. But it does give one pause, in light of everyth ing that has happ ened--g iven the sto ck market and the wealth effect, the ch ange in overall price levels, and the increase in labor market pressures. Even given productivity changes, on e has to won der when co mpensation levels are go ing to be su ch that they will outstrip the growth in productivity and start to be a factor  in term s of ove rall prices. In that regard, as we prepared our fo recast in Bo ston, we had  som e trouble accep ting that trend productivity growth m ight be som ewhere north of 2½ percen t and that potential might be 3.8 percent or so. We are also a little less bullish, especially with regard to PCE spending. But overall, if we look at our for ecast with an assu mption of no policy ch ange and com pare it to the Greenbook’s flat policy altern ative, the differences are not substantial. We are in ag reem ent with the staff that policy do es need to b e tighter to k eep inflation  from rising above 3 percent by late  2000 or early 2001. The questi ons are by how m uch--75 basis points or m ore--and when. It is hard to know the answer to how m uch since it is difficult to know what will happen when we m ake the nex t move and step on the brakes. In my view anyway, the next m ove m ay be seen differently than the last three. After all, it cou ld be argued that those three tightenings w ere sim ply taking m onetary policy back to where it was before the A sian crisis. The next m ove would bring short-term rates high er than they were in the spring of 1998 when we first adopted a bi as toward tightening. There is at least a bit of a risk tha t the m arket will ove rreact, par ticularly given ho w frothy it h as been of  late. 12/21/99 29 When to m ove is also an  issue largely because of  Y2K. I, for  one, don’t see us putting  at risk all the efforts we have m ade toward  keeping m arkets calm and liquid through the century date change by m aking a policy change now  that could just as easily be m ade early in 2000. Nonetheless, if it is ri sky to move now, which it m ight be, it is also risky to wait much longer. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President McTeer.

MR. MCTEER. Econom ic growth in the Elev enth District has accelerated slightly over the last couple of months. Thanks to higher oil and natural gas prices, the energy sector has picked up somewhat, with the resu lt that over all econom ic activity and optim ism in Houston and the Gulf Coast area more ge nerally have im proved significantly. Houston had been the only spot of softness among our m ajor m etropolitan areas. Growth in our manufacturing industries has been  robust of late. Higher intere st rates com bined with som e overbuilding have acted to put a dent in the pace of new hom e and co mmercial construction activity. In spite of continued widespread talk about tight la bor m arkets, retailers in the District report that, surprisingly, they were able to find a good supply of workers for the holiday season, contrary to Cathy Minehan’s report on New England. Employers in the high-tech field continue to i nnovate in their practice of boosti ng non-base pay so that their overall increases in com pensation are held with in the bound aries n ecessary to m aintain profit m argins. The national econom y, if anything, s eems stronger--and un iform ly stronger--than even the m ost optim istic forecasters had antici pated. I understand th at the variance in  state employm ent growth rates is at its lo west leve l ever re corded , which ref lects a na tiona l econom y without any significant regional shocks and an econom y with very low frictional unem ployment assoc iated with the n eed f or labor  mobility. As forecasts are revised upward so, too, is the ou tlook for pro ductiv ity gains and reduced unit labor costs. We seem  to rem ain in the virtuous cycle of supply expanding in tandem  with increased dem and or vice versa. The im proved growth prospects around the world do not seem  to alter the s ituatio n. The Blue Chip m edian forecasts f or the fifteen larges t econ omies are un iform ly positive--and s ignificantly in all of them  econom ic activity increased between March and November--cons istent with Karen Johnso n’s repo rt earlier regard ing th e staff’s forecast for th e rest of the world. But th e strong perform ance of world 12/21/99 30 equity m arkets suggests that growing worl d dem and can be accommodated without higher inflation. In the com ing weeks, the Fed should do nothing that will alter the m arkets’ confidence that we stand  ready to p rovide liquid ity and stability to financial m arkets. After Y2K events are clearly behind us, we can address the longer-term  policy issues at our time can only cause disruption and should be avoided.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Seventh District econom y continues to be strong. Many of our retailers indicate that  sales have been ahead of expectations since Thanksgiving. There are al ways som e retailers who are nervous and, as one m ajor retailer noted late last week, the play  is at the p late. The light v ehicles m arket continues to boom . We are seeing a modest shift in the co mposition of sales away from light trucks back toward passenge r cars, and this shift bodes well for our District as we have a relatively higher concentration in the production of passenger ca rs than light trucks. The situa tion in the f arm econom y is unc hanged, with large grain inventories and low commodity prices. Even so, bankers we ha ve talk ed to in the ag ricultural areas a re feeling m ore comfortable because of the govern ment subsidy checks th at have recently gone out to farm ers; those checks have added substan tially to to tal farm incom e. Our directors and other business contacts al so continue to cite  very tight labor substantia l gains in p roductiv ity neg ated a t least in part by increases in overtim e costs. Ed Boehne m entioned the shortage of truck drivers. One of our  form er directors who runs a large trucking com pany noted that the shortage of truck drivers has led his firm  to cut back on new truck orders. He maintains that he coul d use 500 m ore drivers if he could get them . In a sim ilar vein, a m ajor construction e quipm ent m anufacturer observed that his firm expects no g rowth in near-term  sales because of the labor sho rtages facin g construction contractors. Prices continue  to be subdued; still, the pr icing environm ent seem s to be changing. Contacts in the steel industry reported som e upward  movement in prices. As Jerry Jordan m entioned before, not only have steel scrap prices gone up, so have contract prices for steel deliveries in the year 2000. These contract prices are up about 1 percent 12/21/99 31 relative to a year ago. This com pares with contract prices that we re dow n 5 percent in 1999 relative to 1 998. We are also getting  reports th at advertising prices are m oving up. To give some idea of the high volum e of advertising, one large m agazine printer m entioned to m e that several m ajor business m agazines, incl uding Forbes and Fortune, are now lim iting the amount of a dvertising p ages they can accept b ecause they h ave reach ed a binding con straint on their m aximum page count. The Chicago Purchasing Managers’ report indi cates that the overall index as well as the prices paid and the su pply and delivery  com ponents m oved down in Decem ber, but all three com ponents rem ained well above the 50 pe rcent level. I would remind you that these data shou ld be tre ated co nfidentia lly, as they won’ t be re leased until Dec ember 30th. Jerry Jordan, as for basketball tickets, I can  assure you that the pr ice of tickets for the Chicago Bulls gam es did not go up this year . [Laughter] They are still $80. Y2K re mains a question m ark in the near term . Firm s in our District indicate that they have m ade extensive preparation and th ey are ready. Many have set up centralized Y2K communication centers. In fact, a large temporary help fi rm in our District indicated that it has seen a heavy dem and for tempor ary workers to staff these centers. Finally, in response to a question about i nventory building, the head of a national trucking firm observed that there w as no need to  worry about a buildup in retail inventories for Y2K. Business for h is custom ers was so st rong that they couldn’t build inventories if they wanted to. Turning to the national econom y, our  views have  changed little sinc e we last m et. We rem ain in broad agreem ent with the gene ral contours of the Gree nbook forecast. Final domestic dem and continues to run quite str ong, as consum ers and businesses spend their way to the end of the year. Given this momentum in final dem and, labor m arkets m ay tighten sligh tly m ore in the next few months even  as output g rowth decelerates to tren d. Despite this, incom ing labor com pensation da ta have rem ained benign as productivity growth has repeated ly ex ceeded our expectati ons. However, the data now in hand sugg est that the dece leration in o ur price m easures has ended. Indeed , it se ems likely tha t price and wage m ovem ents will worsen in th e year ah ead as we see th e lagged ef fects of  prev ious oil price hikes and changes in the dollar exchange rate. 12/21/99 32 Consequently, as has been true for so me time, we are concern ed that core inflation ary pressures are likely to in creas e markedly over the next few quarters. Of course, I recognize that several key aspects of the outlook  are quite uncertain. First, as we discussed earlier, we can’t predict with any co nfidence the future path of stock prices or the wealth effects that they m ay induce. And I continue to  be concerned about high valuation levels for the stock m arket, particularly for the Internet  stocks. Second, we don’t really know whether productivity growth will slow, rem ain high, or continue to accelerat e. Third, although the futures m arket poin ts to declin ing oil prices in th e year ah ead, the oil m arket has surprised us before, and consum er confidence m ay be qui te vulnerable to such shocks. Despite these considerations, I believe the risks to the ou tlook are on the upside. However, given the uncertainties  associated with the upcom ing cen tury rollover, this is no t the time to be aggressive.

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The District econom y rem ains in good shape and I will only co mment on a f ew things that have ch anged relativ e to prev ious discussions. Agriculture, it turn s out, has had a som ewhat better  year than m any had feared. A lot of that is due to governm ent paym ents. But in addition crops turn ed out to be large, which helped, and the cattle m arket has im prove d a bit. Comm ercial construction has been strong in the District for quite som e time and a num ber of new office buildings will be coming on stream  in the Twin Cities m arket over the next on e to thr ee yea rs. It is now anticipated that as a cons equence vacancy ra tes w ill probably double or triple in the T win Cities. But that re ally do esn’t s eem to have cause d any ala rm. It is, I gues s, the oth er side of the coin when a lot o f buildings a re built in  a short period of tim e. Employm ent gains in the District have slowed; that appea rs to ref lect mostly jus t a lack of unemployed workers. Labor m arkets rem ain very tight. Wage gains st art at 3 or 4 percent and go up from  there; but the distribution is skewed and m ost of the increases really are in the 3 to 4 percen t range. But, of course, that leaves out all of the othe r extras that m ight go into compensation. There is still a general lack of broad inflationary pressures. And overall I would say that m ost of our contacts are quite pos itive about th e econom ic outlook for the year ahead. As far as the national econom y is concer ned, I have a fair am ount of conviction about the ou tlook for eco nomic expansion. Our model forecast is for g rowth of 3½ to 4 12/21/99 33 percent in real term s over the next tw o years.  That’s actually a little below the Greenbook forecast bu t it seem s to m e that conditions are right for a con tinuation of pretty solid real growth. I have a lot less conviction about the in flation outlook. The Greenbook, of course, has a sto ry of acceleratin g inflation. This is a familiar story and it has a certain log ic to it. But the surp rises to inf lation ove r the last s everal years have been on the downside. There is a danger in extrapolating that kind of perfor mance. On the other hand, w e have been trying to do som e serious s tatistical work on  the unem ploym ent/inf lation/NAIRU rela tionsh ip, and it looks as if  that relationship really deterior ates a lot beginning in the m id-1980s. We are skeptical that there is an y real relatio nship between unem ploym ent and inflation if one concentrates on the period since about the m id-1980s. Now, I wouldn’t bet the farm  on this work just yet. We have more analysis to do. But our work thus far does suggest that we

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH. Mr. Chairm an, the Second District’s econom y continues to grow at a moderate pace. Despite co ntinued wid espread evid ence of price increases for m anufacturing inputs and housing, overall inflation rem ains subdued at the consum er level. You have all no doubt heard of the dram a of the possible New  York City transit strike. The Transit Auth ority reach ed an elev enth hour agreem ent with the transit workers union. The settlem ent calls for a 5 percent wage  hike in the first ye ar, 3 percent in the second year, and 4 percent in the third. That actually follows very m uch the pattern of the Long Island Railroad settlem ent about a year ago.  Because th e pension p lan is well funded, employee pension deductions are being reduced substantially, boosting the average worker’s take-hom e pay by an estim ated additional 2.3 pe rcent. The C ity’s T ransit Authority is actually funded through the State governm ent. The Mayor is trying very hard to tell all the municipal w orkers whom he pays that the rath er attractive settlem ent for transit worke rs should not confuse them into thi nking that he is going to give  them  the sam e deal. So we There has been m uch discussion, and I won’t repeat it, on the levels of national and international econom ic activity. But why should one be concerne d? I think foreign growth, 12/21/99 34 as Karen Johnson and others have said, is likely  to be stronger. That will increase the demand for commodities and, ceteris paribus, in creas e their prices. It will also increase the demand for Am erican exports, thus increasing overall dem and in an econom y in which demand already exceeds even the increased capac ity of the su pply side of the econom y to provide goods and services. Despite probabl y higher exports, the current account deficit will still be very high. And, therefore, we are likely to hav e either a s table or som ewhat weaker dollar. That will m ean that we will not have the ben efit in th e next year o r two of the very sub stantial h elp to core CPI that ha s com e from  import prices being significantly less strong than dom estic prices. Our analys is, using a passthrough of about 0.4 of the exchange rate to im port prices, tells us that the core CPI would have  been 0.6 percent higher over recent years if we hadn’t had that benef it from import prices, and I don’t th ink we will continue to have it. Thus, we  don’t have to be concerned so lely about w hether we are going to run out of  laborers, even though I think that is a valid concern. The m ere things that I’ve  cited --essentially th e effect on th e United States of international developm ents--leads u s to believ e that the core CPI w ill start creeping u p and, left to its ow n devices, w ill hit abou t 2.8 percen t in 2001. I don’t th ink that is som ething that the Committee should wish to see happen. But I feel very strongly that we have done such a good job of defusing Y2K tensions that the time to interest ourselves in that problem , which I believe is a very r eal one, is on February 1st and 2nd and not today. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. Let m e use my tim e to m ake som e longer-term  suggestions about how we shoul d be operating, elaborating on som e comments that I m ade earlier. Herb Stein once said som ething that comes close to capturing the essence of econom ics: “Things that can’t go on, won’t.” What econom ists are good at, if anything, is putting together different l ogical postulates: dem and, supply, arbitrage conditions, relationships between  stocks and flows, and pred ictions of the way economies are likely to operate. In the end, econom ic forecasts rely on in teractions between such basic logical assumptions. As I think about m y two years on th is Comm ittee, m uch of what has happ ened refutes Stein’s quote. Things that couldn’t go on, have gone right on! [Laughter] They 12/21/99 35 first exam ple is labor markets. Since I’ve been  here we have been talking about very tight labor m arkets as indicated by the unemploym ent rate, other m easures of labor tightness, and Beigebook reports. We have all felt that at some point wages would start to accelerate but as yet they really haven’t--apart  from som e of the caveats that Mike Prell gave earlier. The second example is the stock m arket. Again, it has been seem ingly overvalued since I’ve been here, but to this point stock prices have  risen on balance. The third exam ple is the dollar, which for a while now has seem ingly been  overvalued, if there is any lim it at a ll on the accum ulation by foreigners of dollar-d enom inated assets. But it is not yet falling. At the intellectual level we should, of course, keep studying these m atters to see if we can improve our understanding of how the econom y is operating. But studying and learning take tim e and in the m eantim e we have to know how to set monetary policy. As I m entioned last tim e, an approach that m ay help us in these particular circum stances is inflation targeting, which is  being adopted on a perv asive basis around the world. Last tim e--I supp ose in a fit o f exubera nce--I reported  being to ld that the num ber of countries now using inflation targeting was 44. I have since tr ied to verify that total and could only com e up with 30. And even that  num ber counts the EU as 11. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER( ?). So, it’s only 20! 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. That’s right. Perhaps it’s only 20. The adoption of inflation targeting is not as widespread as I sa id ear lier, but it’s stil l widespread. And it has worked well where it has been tried, as docum ented by a number of research papers. Perhaps m ore telling, no country that I know of ha s tried in flation targeting and then abandoned it. What m any academ ics like about inflation targ eting is that it gives policy a nom inal anchor and improves transparency and credib ility. Those are im portant values. But I’d like to put inflation targeting on our  table for a different reason. It seem s to me that it would work well when we are facing ju st the sort  of econom ic uncertain ties that I m entioned above. First of all, when there are either productivity or com petitive shocks in labor perm its us to follow the policy of watchful wait ing we often talk about . Just what are we waiting for?  It is really to see signs o f an acceleration of inflation, in which case we can react by m aking appropriate policy changes. 12/21/99 36 Another unc ertainty that inf lation tar geting perm its us to finesse is that of deciding just what our target rate of inflation is. Around the world, most  inflation-targeting countries do have fairly specific quantitative targets. I’m not sure that th is group could agree on a precise inflation target, but I don’t think we have  to agree. What I think we can all agree on is that we should m ove a gainst an acceleration of  inflation. In effect, this pragm atic form  of inflation targeting, where we m ove against an  acceleration of inflation, m ay provide us a reasonable fram ework for thinking about m onetary policy in the presence of either productivity  or com petitive shocks. But even this pragm atic form of inflation targeting has one im portant difficulty. The big difficulty I see is in acting p reemptively, w hich I think is neces sary if we really are to stabiliz e inflation a t present low lev els. In ord er to act p reemptive ly we must be able  to forecast inflation, and th at can p resent a prob lem. We could rely on m odeling app roaches to forecast inflation, bu t these have no t been ve ry successful precisely because of the su pply shocks that have m ade the inflation-targeting approach attractive. We could rely on leading indica tors, b ut the re aren’t many relia ble le ading indicators that are not already considered in models. We could rely on the forecasts of inflation of others, but tho se other forecasters I do think w e could m ake som e headway here, but it’s not easy to do so. If we were to go through a pragm atic inflation-targeting exercise today, I thi nk we w ould find that some added tightening might soon becom e nece ssary, though we m ight be able to d elay for a short tim e. But stepping back from  these sp ecifics, I th ink a n important early challenge for us is to learn how to deal effectivel y with the econom ic uncertainties, perhaps by inflation targeting or perhaps in some other way. Thank you.

In summary, our labor m arket continues to be tight but not im possible, pricing power remains limited for most firm s, and there are sm all but  noticeable effects in the housing industry from the inc rease in in terest rates. 12/21/99 37 On the Y2K front notes that Apparently were planning to curtail operati ons on those tw o days. had planned not to operate on the 31st but had so m any requests from  custom ers that it will be operating, though it will not My sense of it is that are finding the capacity--that the industry has responded and there is rea lly no thing m ore to be said abo ut it. I’m guessing th at at the end of  the day we will find virtually all of this Y2K effect lost in the rounding error and we  are not going to see much effect. On the national econom y, I would make just one comment, nam ely that as far as I can te ll there is no sign ificant re straint from any quarter. Everything we’re looking at is solid, strong. I don’t see anything on the downs ide. I still react ne gatively to the term “drag” in term s of net exports. That term  continues to annoy m e. It seems to m e that net exports are about as m uch of a drag as a Styrofoam boat anchor. [Laughter] Thank you.

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I think we are entering a period, as others have said, that is goi ng to be som ewhat challenging for us. In the short run, w e clearly do not want to destabilize markets as we go into the Y2K period. One always hates to see a m arathon runner trip up at the end, and we certainly don’t want  to be the person from  the stands who runs out and trips that  runner up. In the longer run, obviously, as others have indicated, we don’t want to lose our ongoing battle with inflation expectations and inflation, or risk any dam age to our own credibility. During the interm eeting period, which has been short, we have received a variety of data, som e benign and som e more troubling. On the benign side, the latest reports do show that the rate of increase in core inflati on has m oderated even a bit m ore from that experienced over the p revious 12-m onth period. Additionally , productivity seem s to have ticked up again and growth in unit labor costs seem s to be, if anything, slowing as opposed to pick ing u p. All of this is, as o thers have adm itted, som ewhat puzzling. On the m ore troubling side, there are clea rly growing signs of i mbalances in our econom y. Others have touched on a num ber of  them . I will em phasize just one, which is 12/21/99 38 the large and growing external deficit, a deve lopment I view as a sign of imbalance. As Karen Johns on indicated , there is a s ignificant po ssibility that we will see interactions as a number of econom ies start to grow sim ultaneousl y. While our external balance will, I think, tend to be redressed as foreign econom ies retu rn to health, there will be an increased demand for our exports, which m ight not be  totally welcom e from  a price stability standpoin t. Indeed, taking account o f likely Y2K im pacts, foreign dem and for our goods does appear to be increasing already. As this happens, we can obviously expect som e upward pressure on resource util ization, not just in labor m arkets but also in term s of capacity utilization. And I th ink the recen t uptick in the la tter m easure may be just a precursor. While I reco gnize th at there are som e uncertainties in thes e international fo recas ts, I do think th e risks inte rnationa lly are more on the upside than the downs ide. Clearly, there are som e difficulties in Japan. But it is in structive to note tha t comm ents by individual members of the Monetary Policy Co mmittee of Japan and the m ost recen t monthly econom ic report com ing out of Japan both seem  to have a m uch firm er tone to them  than had been the case even a month or two ago. Certainly the European econom ies see m to be firming. There is a possibil ity that they m ay start to enjoy som e of the productivity surprises that we’ve experienced, but  that is not entirely certain. So, given this changing configuration, I th ink we would be well served to extend our cautious and prudent approach to policy. We should continue to recognize the benign effects of productivity improvem ents on unit cost  structures, but we also should not be afraid to act in a well-m odulated fashion in order to m aintain our ha rd fought victory over inflation and also our credibil ity. Thank you very m uch.

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I raised m y hand this m orning m ainly to be recorded as present and part icipating in this section of th e meeting. [Laughter] That’s because little seem s to have changed  in recent w eeks. The econom y apparently continues to have a strong head of steam , the inflation ne ws continues favorable,  and productivity growth remains strong. Barring a significant shift in momentum  or some external shock from Y2K or elsewhere, it appears likely  that m ore tightening could we ll be required over the forecast period, with the Comm ittee focused more heavil y on how much and when. That outlook is 12/21/99 39 juxtaposed against the substant ial tightening of recent m onths that has not yet had its full impact on the econom y, and which could possibl y provide all or m ost of t he restraint necessa ry in this ep isode . Consequently, it  is fortunate that the challenging m illenniu m rollover period, which is now at hand, is also on it s merits an appropriate tim e to rest on our oars just a bit and assum e as low a profile as possible. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. There is clearly strong m omentum  in private domestic dem and and at the sam e time few signs of rising core inflation. So far so good. The issue is su stainability. The Greenbo ok weighs in  with an ass essment that the current state is not sustainable--not at the cu rrent monetary po licy s etting or even with the 75 basis point increase in the funds rate assu med in the Greenbook forecast. This, we all understand, is only a forecast and just one forecas t at that. And as several speakers this morning have noted, there are m any elem ents of uncertainty surrounding the outlook, especially about inflation dyna mics, NAIRU, and productivity. But I buy into the qualitative story of the Greenbook. I buy into th e balance of risks that it identifies and into the message that I think it conveys about the challenges we m ay be facing next year. From  my perspective the ch allenges are es pecially great becau se I think we face two reinforc ing elem ents of unsustain ability. We have an unsustainably rapid pace of growth on top of an already unsustainably high  labor u tilization rate. So, in short, I think we have our work cut out for us. I believe next year will be an especially key one for m onetary policy. Even if we do move to tighten policy next year, the overall pi cture of growth and in flation m ight still look quite favorable, particu larly if the staff is corre ct that we will face declin ing oil prices  after the peak in the first quarter. But in th e com ing year we will h ave the oppo rtunity to take the steps that will im prove the prospects of cont aining inflation going forward and, by doing so, hopefully extend even further this remarkable expansion. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s turn now to Don Kohn for his report. 12/21/99 40 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. The discussion in the Bluebook assum ed that you would rule out a tightening at this m eeting. While you m ight be troubled about the inflation outlook, a firm ing woul d com e as a com plete surprise to century date change, such a surprise  could have unintended consequences, including market disruptions. Moreov er, any inflation threat would not seem  so pressing that waiting six weeks to address it would m ake the problem  materially worse. Neith er surveys nor T IPS-nom inal yield spreads indicate an up creep in long -run inflation expectations; and these results suggest that econom ists, hous eholds, and m arket participants remain conf ident tha t the Federal Reserve will co ntain any em erging inflation p ressures. If the Committee agrees w ith this jud gment about the inadv isability of tightening at this m eeting, what rema ins on the table is how to assess the risks to the econom y goi ng forward and their im plications for future policy, and how to convey that assessm ent to the m arkets. Econom ic data over the last m onth followed the now-fam iliar pattern : Upward revisions to estim ates and projections of econom ic growth in the second half of 1999 have been acco mpanied by mostly favorable indicators of  cost and price pressures.  In the latter catego ry, CPI increases in the fourth quarter have been in  line with staf f expectations, and estim ates of unit labor co st increas es in the second half have been reduced noticeably, accentuating the deceleration in  this measure from  the firs t half of the year. The downward revision to unit labor cost increases, which occurred despite a sm all upward revi sion to the growth of compensation, owed to productivity ga ins that, again, seem  to be com ing in above projections. Faster prod uctivity growth has helped  to explain the lim ited drop in th e unemploym ent rate this year; the une mploym ent rate and the pool of available workers cited in re cent announcem ents were essentially unchanged last m onth despite the unexp ected strength in the expansion of econom ic activity. If stable labor utiliz ation over the last m onth along with continuing uncertainties about the level and gr owth of aggregate supply implied by recen t cost and price d ata make th e Comm ittee no m ore convinced th an it was at its la st meeting th at it will n eed to f irm policy in the ne ar term, it might want to consider retaining a symmetric directive. With broad measures of core inflatio n still s ubdu ed, the Comm ittee m ay wish to see more and firm er indicators that pri ce pressur es are like ly to in tensif y before it gives serious considera tion to raising rates further. But one rationale f or the  symmetric directive at the las t meeting was to allow the Comm ittee tim e to gauge  whether th e cum ulative tigh tening this year would begin to dam p the expansion of the econom y. Such a 12/21/99 41 slowing is n eeded becau se, despit e rapid productivity increases, a widening output gap and falling unemplo yment rate in the second half of 1999 clearly indicate that the economy has been expanding at a rate in excess of the growth of its potential . However, in that regard, the incom ing data on the real econom y have not been encouraging. Moreover, the Greenbo ok forecast has growth rem aining a little above trend in the f irst ha lf of next year abstracting fr om Y2K e ffects, and Mike noted the upward risks to the outlo ok beyond that from  the impetus to consum ption from  rising wealth. While one m ight guess that the increasingly narrow base and specula tive ch aracter of the stock m arket advance carries the seeds of its own correction, the assum ption of such a correction w ould seem  to be a risky basis for m aking m onetary policy. Even if the Comm ittee is agnostic for now about whether an unem ployment rate in its recen t rang e of 4 to 4¼ percen t can be sustained without rising inflation, it m ay be pa rticularly concerne d about a potential further decline in that rate. If temporary factors played any role in damping core inflation in 1999 while the unem ploym ent rate held in this range, the NAIRU is m ore likely to be  higher tha n lower than  the cur rent unem ployment rate. In that cas e, failing to resist a possible further tightening in labor m arkets runs a consid erable ris k of buildin g in the ne ed for large r and more disru ptive ad justm ents later. The persistent strength of dom estic dem and suggests that avoiding a further decline in the unem ploym ent rate m ay well require at leas t the current degree of restraint in long-term  interest rates. Forward-looking financial m arkets hav e built in expec tations of  substantial po licy tightening in 2000, without any pickup in inflation. Although supply-side uncertainties com plicate the conduct of  policy, markets are presum ing that the Comm ittee will b e preemptive, at leas t when it com es to inf lation r isks that m ight arise from  possible fu rther increases in labor resource utilization. Any signal that th e Comm ittee was significan tly less concerned about potential inflation th an the m arket perceived it to be would probably produce a considerable de crease in interest rates and rise in stock prices. Hence, if the Comm ittee d id see the risks as significantly tilted toward higher inflation, it would be im portant to convey that view to the m arkets. An announcem ent that the Comm ittee was asymm etrical in its outlook for the econom y and policy next year would be unlikely to have a major ef fect on inte rest r ates. Market prices have already built in a near certainty of a tigh tening at the n ext meeting--much higher odds than have norm ally followed the announcem ent of an asymm etric directive. And when surveyed, two-thirds of prim ary dealer eco nomists ind icated that they expect such a directive. But con cerns about the sensitivity of thin and illiquid m arkets around the century da te change m ay complicate how the 12/21/99 42 Comm ittee communicates its asses sment. Presum ably, the Comm ittee would not want to add unnecessarily to market volatility a t this tim e by leaving op en the possib ility that an  interm eeting tightening w as on the table. Moreover, it especially m ight not want to convey the impression that it m ight be sluggish in responding to a m arket disruption that looked like m ore th an a transito ry event. This suggests that the Co mmittee m ight have th ree straightforward messages to convey to markets at 2:15 t oday: First, that it did not change the stance of policy; second, that it was concerned about inflation risks and would be giving serious considerati on to the extent of the risks and the appropriate policy response at its next  meeting; but third, that owing to uncertain market conditions around y ear-end it did not intend to respond to those risks before the next m eeting and would be flexible over the century date change period. Unfortunately, the choice of bias in  the directiv e to associate with those m essages is m uch less straightf orward than the m essages them selves. Simply stated, there is a disconnect between  the language the Comm ittee votes on in its directive, which specif ically references the interm eeting period only, and the m eaning that has com e to be attached to that language. That m eaning is th at the bias applies less to the intermeeting period than to the pe riod encom passing the next f ew FOMC meetings. All of  the op tions th e Committee has to deal with this problem  have more than a bit of im provisation in them , in that you would be skirting between what the words literally m ean and the m arket conventions that have settled around them . For exam ple, the Comm ittee could  couple an unbiased, that is symm etric, direc tive with a biased announcem ent that made it clear that the symmetry appl ied only to the interm eeting period. The Comm ittee would count on the w ording of the announcem ent to express its concerns about inflation risks and its intention to consider at its next m eeting how to deal with those ri sks. A problem  with this approach is that it cou ld foster further confusio n about the Comm ittee’s interpretation of the curr ent directiv e. But so lon g as the ann ouncem ent was clear ab out the Comm ittee’s presen t intentions and judgm ents, such confusion would not m atter m uch since th is is lik ely the las t meeting that the cur rent d irective wor ding will b e used. The second option would be to adopt an asymm etric, that is biased, directive based on the meaning it has co me to have with respect to future meetings, but to use the announcem ent to clarify that in light of the century d ate change the Comm ittee did not in tend to tigh ten over the interm eeting period and recognized th e need to be ready to respond flexibly to a ny develop ments in co ming weeks. While this approach 12/21/99 43 would be more consistent with recent uses of asymm etries, it would have the dis advan tage th at the Comm ittee would be adopting words in the direc tive ab out the inte rmeeting period that it did not m ean literally. And thus the m edia and m arkets m ight focus m ore on the choice of asymm etry than on the caveats in the announcem ent. In that sense transparency about your choice of bias m ight m islead markets about your very near-term inten tions. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. That concludes m y briefing. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Questions for Don? 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Don, just listening to you te lls m e how difficult it will be to craft any kind of asymm etric announcem ent today. Wouldn’t it seem  practical  to have this be one of those announcements where we say as l ittle as possible--som ething along the lines of we m et, we didn’t do anything, and we’ll see you next year? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. That’s an option we talked about a bit in the Bluebook. The issue in my m ind was whether th e Comm ittee was rea lly intent on keeping the current degree of tightening in the m arkets. There would be a risk if you did what you propose, it seem s to me, though it very well m ight work: The m arkets m ight say the FOMC is symmetric, or unbiased, an d it’s b ecaus e of Y2K. They are no t telling us any thing else, s o we will as sume that that is the only reason they  are unbiased. But I think you can’t rule out the possibility, however small, that the m arket would say the FOMC is unbiased because of Y2K and, because they didn’t tell us a nything about their expectations for the future, m aybe they are not quite as worried about inflation as we t hought they were. With two-thirds of m arket econom ists expecting an asymm etric directiv e and with about 80 or  90 percent tightening built in, tha t’s a dilemma. The Comm ittee’s objec tive might be to le ave the m arkets at 2:30 today where they were before our announcem ent at 2:15. It’s just very hard to craft the set of statem ents and votes that will do that. I’m not sure that a terse announcem ent would do it. It’s possible that it would, but th ere is a risk that it wouldn’t. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Don, I thought that was a particularly outstanding presentation except for the last sentence. In the very last  sentence you expressed som e concern that even if we were transparent and honest-- if we told the m arket very cl early that our pr iority was to assure liqu idity ove r the century d ate change and that we wouldn’t be taking up the balance-12/21/99 44 of-risks issue until the F ebruary m eeting--an asymmetric directive could, nevertheless, mislead the m arket. Do you really think so? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think either approach is lik ely to work: symm etry, but we’re really asymm etric f or the next m eeting; or asymm etry, but we’re re ally symm etric un til the next meeting. It’s a question of weighing, if you’ll pardon the expression, the balance of risks-­[laughter]--not with respect to  the econom y but with respect to the m arket reaction. I was trying to point out that I think there is a risk, p erhaps a sm all risk, tha t the initial h eadline will be “Fed  goes asymm etric” rath er than “Fed  goes asymm etric but with a num ber of caveats.” An unqualified headline could provoke a little m arket reaction. There is no perfect way to do this. The risk on the other side is tha t the h eadline will b e “Fed goes symmetric,” and the m arket doesn’t read the announcem ent and begins to rally. I think probably after a day, after people have had a chance to read the announcem ent and newspapers have prin ted it, we would probably be in rough ly the sam e place either way. It is just a question of what best represents wh at you intend and the clearest way to get that across. The other thing that bothers m e a little  about asymmetry is that the words in the directive literally say “over the intermeeting period,” and the announcem ent would literally have to say “but we don’t m ean it.” 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. There’s nothi ng new  there! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think either way would work, or  at least I hope so. Either way would be intended to produce the sam e result. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. You said one of the goals, an d I totally agree with you, is to try to leave the m arket at 2:30 today the sam e way it was at 2:15. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Right. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. In that regard, since there is a heavy degree of expectation that we will be a symm etric, it se ems to m e that asymm etry would be more like ly than symm etry to produce that kind of stability in the m arket. If symm etry is goi ng to be a surprise and gives an extra boo st to th e market, isn ’t that where th e greater risk lies ? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. As I indicated in answer to  Governor Meyer, I think the risk of publishing asymmetry is that it could produce a little m ore volatility. The risk of publishing 12/21/99 45 symmetry is  that the m arkets m ight rally a b it. Maybe the 2:30 com parison isn’t the right one; m aybe it’s rea lly w here th e markets are by close of business the next day. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. But if the expectations are that we see the sam e risks that the 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think you could m ake that cl ear under either approach. It depends on the announcem ent and where you want to put the em phasis. If your e mphasis is on the fact that you will be provid ing liquid ity and you w ill be flexible o ver the interm eeting period-­and that’s the near-term  focus--then m aybe symm etry is better. If your emphasis is more on the fact that there is  a good chance that you’ll be giving se rious consideration to tightening at the next m eeting, then asymm etry may be better, with less focus on the interm eeting period. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Further que stions?  If not , let m e begin. I think the evidence of a slowdown is quite m arginal a t this stage.  It is showing up in the housing industry at the edges, where we are seeing so me slippage or at least a flattening of activity. However, anything rese mbling a contraction induc ed by interest rates strikes m e as not even remotely visible as ye t. Motor vehicles, which also are supposed to be interest-sensitive, weakened  significantly a m onth or two ago, but they have com e back fairly substantially. And if we look across the spectrum  of the capital goods m arkets, there is very little evidence of any weakening. Obviously, we still have disproportionately large orders for high-tech equipm ent versus other t ypes of equipm ent; but orders for conventional equipm ent are still substantial, with f arm equipment being an obvious exception. In my view, what we have is a problem of whether to interpret developm ents as supply-side driven or dem and-side  driven. On the supply side, there is no evidence of  any slowing in productivity growth. What we do have is som e evidence from  the industrial production num bers for October and Nove mber and from  the hours data that is pointing to gangbuster gains in productivity  for the fourth quarter. The notion that when we see this strong de mand we are look ing at the o ld class ical case of an econom y that is heating up is, I subm it, the wrong view. We don’t know that the econom y is heating up unless by “heating up” we mean anything that raises the GDP growth rate. At this stage we have a very unusual si tuation. There are very evident im balances in demand ove r supply, and indeed one can readily argue  that virtually all of  the problems stem 12/21/99 46 from  a wealth effect. Were it not for a signi ficant rise in wealth-to-household incom e, we probably would find that the propensities to save would be relativ ely stable, that the unem ployment rate would be very low but also stable, and that the current account deficit, while large, would not be increas ing. All in all, the fact th at underlying pri ce inflation was not accelerating would argue against a scenario of an econom y that is heating up. It would be a scenario of very strong growth--indee d, one credibly involving accelerating grow th-­but all of it stemm ing from the productivity num bers. All I’m  saying at this point is that one could not argue that this econom y is heating up were it n ot for the gr adual dec line in the poo l of people who are willing to work and an increasing share of overall dem and being m et from  the im port side. The heat, if any, is coming from the wealth effect. And that clearl y is som ething that cannot go on indefinitely. The bottom  line is tha t the wealth ef fect--in lin e with Herb Stein’s rem ark--canno t continue an d, therefore, will not continue. The reason is th at it creates a fundam ental instability in that it fo sters m ore effective dem and than supply. The two must be balanced in some manner. They currently are being balan ced, as I indicated last m onth and previously, by m ore dom estic production com ing from  previously unemployed workers and by increased im ports as a share of total dem and. Neither of those two sources of supply can continue to satisfy rising de mand without lim it. Obviously, on the im port side it is not credible that our economy can continuously attract investm ents to fund the current account deficit in our balance of paym ents. And on the labor side there is a level, called zero, where the availability of added em ployees disappe ars. The one caveat with regard to the availability of workers is imm igration, which I will g et to sho rtly. The reason I raise this issue is essentiall y to say that the wealth effect cannot continue to stim ulate excess dem and indefinitel y. By wealth effect, I m ean a rise in th e value of ass ets in relatio n to incom e. Such  a rise does accom modate high er equity values but it cannot continue at the pace we have b een seeing. There are only two ways in which such a rise can be thwarted, as indeed it m ust. One is a decline in long -term  expected earnings, for which I find no evidence. Indeed, if anything, it is th e other way around. The other is a ris e in the d iscount factor. This is bas ically true by definition w hen we disaggregate equity m arket values. To talk in  term s of mom entum , or price/sales ratios, or, even better, how m uch in losses a firm has expe rienced as reasons for higher stock prices is 12/21/99 47 clearly just nonsense. The funda mental consid eration is that a buyer is purchasing claim s against future cash. If neither lower expect ations of future cash nor a higher discount occurs, th en stock pr ices presum ably will con tinue to rise, m aybe in exce ss of the rate of increase in household incom es. The crucial consideration here is that, while we m ay not be seeing a change in earnings expectations, w e very clearly are se eing the beginnings of a significant rise in discount factors. Yields on BBB-rated corporates, which are very close proxies for the average corporate cost o f capital, h ave been risi ng quite app reciab ly in r eal terms since late 1997. They have risen more than yields on U.S. Treasuries, as evidenced by widening spreads. On e can evaluate the d iscount factors on equities in term s of risk, the rate of interest on corporate bonds, and th en derive an equity prem ium. But it is f ar more use ful to look at the bond equivalent rates in real term s to get a judgm ent of what type of discount factors are showing up. I think that discounting process is appreciably under way at this stage. Therefore, at the e nd of the day, I think the Greenboo k has to be right that the Wilshire 5000 will flatten out despite continuous  revis ions in the data und erlying that projection. It is only a question of how m uch of a bubble there is  in this process. I think we have to be wary, however, of our  disinclination to rec ognize that what is going on in this econom y is really quite unpreced ented in the post-W orld War II period in that productivity growth continues to rise. And it is rising to a very substantial extent in the multifactor productivity  com ponent--the residu al in growth accounting. So, it is no t solely increased capital investm ent that is driving up the productivity num bers. There is a very substantia l rise in p roductivity grow th--in fact it is alm ost 2 percenta ge points--which is not attributable to capital deepening. Cyclically ad justed, this rivals what went on in the 1950s and 1960s and through the oil em bargo of early 1 973. This basically suggests that w e are getting inc reases in m ultifactor produ ctivity on the order of magnitude that was occurring after W orld War II, but without the catch-ups of the earlier period. In on e sense, the recent experience is far m ore significant than the labo r productivity gains in earlier periods, which as you m ay recall were at fair ly attractive rates of around 3 percent for quite a period of time. Part of that acceleration cam e from  the m ove out of agriculture in to industry ; but what we are beginning to observe now is som ething beyond that. 12/21/99 48 Acrophobia is a problem that confronts every statistician. The concern about putting down on paper a num ber that is larger than has b een seen historically is very inhibiting. What I am  saying is that that is happeni ng. So, while we do have these extraordinary imbalances, I don’t think we ought to be looki ng at dem and and saying it’s unbelievable and the econom y is heating up. The point is that  we do not have sole ly a demand-driven phenom enon here. The dem and phe nomenon stem s from  a wealth effect, and that should concern us b ecause it has obvious rep ercussions . But we cannot look m erely at dem and and say that housing sales are high, capital goods orders are high, and consumption expenditures are high. Of course they are high. They had be tter be high or we ar e mismeasuring what is going on because gross dom estic incom e is rising even faster than its con ceptua lly equivalent counterpart, gross dom estic product. It may well be that if we had better estim ates we could resolve the question of which of these two is the relevant m easure of econo mic growth. My own suspicion is that gross domestic incom e may be givi ng a better reading. The reason I say that is that gross domestic incom e is consistent with the data we see on prices, profit m argins, and the underly ing acceleration in productivity. And that is really say ing that our estim ates of retail sales are biased downward in one way or another or that som e of the m easures we have in other produ ct areas are biased downward. If we had m ore accurate num bers, we would be inclined to say “W ow!” and it would be “W ow!” squared. What I want to say essentially is that we have to be careful about looking onl y at the dem and side rather than the gap between effective dem and on the one hand and s upply on the other. The two taken together are what the widening current accou nt deficit an d the declining unem ploym ent rate b asically reflect. We need to know precisely what is causing our g ood fortune because when it changes, and it is certainly going to change at some point, our basic analysis will m atter. And I am  concerned that we m ight misread contractions in th e econom y or rates of growth, and as a consequence m isunderstand where the forces in the econom y are leading us. I don’t think it m atters in the curr ent context because I believe the notion that at the end of the day we are going to need to tighten more com es out of any type of evaluation. It’s when we are on th e other side tha t I think we  will have to be very ca reful. 12/21/99 49 I mentioned previously that I see no overhea ting other than in the stock market. The price indexes are really quite benign. In this regard, I th ink we ought to set aside the consum er price index. The reason I say that is that the PCE deflator is far more usable for analyzing what is really going on. The owners’ equivalent rent com pone nt in the CPI is 20 percen t of the total index . Now, owners’ equ ivalent ren t is going to start to accelerate unless I misread how asset prices interact with cons umer prices. The reason is that the ratio of owners’ equivalent rent to the value of hous ing has been going down continuously, and the implicit ra te of return th at that is sugg esting cannot credibly be exp ected to continue on a prolonged b asis. So the little “pop” we saw in  owners’ equivalent rent in the m ost recent CPI is probably a harbinger of a s lightly stronger num ber there. The reason the PCE deflator is a better ind icator in m y view is that it inco rporates a far m ore accurate estim ate of the weight of hous ing in total consum er prices than the CPI. The latter is based upon a survey of consum er expenditures, which as we all know very dram atically  underestimates the consum ption of alcohol and t obacco, just to nam e a couple of its com ponents. It also depends on people’ s recollections of what  they spent, and we have m uch harder eviden ce of th at in the re tail sa les data, which is where the PCE deflator comes from . Why we should l ook at data based on a distor ted sam ple whe n we have a universe wh ose data are more accurate is  beyond m e. The reasons that are given theoretically are th at we want to m easure urban or subur ban consum er prices and that’s not what gets picked up in the total. It would be  so easy to m ake a sim ple adjustm ent in the aggregate data to cover only the urban com pone nt by using appropriate ratios if we want to do that. That is, we could use the base universe of what is consum ed to give us our weights, but that is not what the CPI does. So if I had my way, the CPI would be abolished for all uses other than labor union cont racts,  Social Secu rity b enefits , and all the other uses that would create an undue amount of political noise  if we tried to change them. It’s not statistica l noise th at I am talk ing abo ut at the m oment. In sum, I think we have to be careful about any reading of infla tion trends from  the CPI. What I hear from  everybody in business I talk  to is that pricing power, if anything, has gotten tougher rather than easie r. And while it is certainly the case, as Mike Prell points out, that a num ber of prices are going up, it is by no m eans clear how significant those increases are as yet. 12/21/99 50 The one area where we m ay be unde restimating supply-side potential is in population growth and the underlying expans ion of the working-age population. We recen tly m ade an effort to find out why increases in househ old em ploym ent are running 50,000 a m onth less than those in payroll em ployment. We were tryi ng to get a sense of which m easure is giving us the better picture.  If we look at the only really significant independent estim ate of the num ber of househol ds, m easured by the number of electric meter accounts excludin g the double accounts th at a lot of people have, w e should be able to get a reasonably good estim ate of the num ber of households. Indeed, if we take the utility account numbers literally, they suggest that the CPS household estim ates, which are based on population estim ates, have been  underestim ated on a cum ulative basis by som ething in the area of 1 percent since the 1990 Census. If that is in fact the case, given that we have some reasonably accu rate num bers on the averag e size of hou seholds--rem ember, we estim ate the average size of households from  samples of 50,000--we can then apply that average to the population estim ate extrapolated from the 1990 data. In doing that we m ust take account of estim ates of births m inus deaths plus imm igrations, both legal and otherwise. A key question here is w hether birt hs and deaths are underestim ated or biased. That is a possibility, but sure ly the immigration nu mbers are a real guess. If we take the household electrical connections numbers seriousl y, then the issue of cl osing the gap in the household employm ent data versus the payroll data m oves forward a pace. The Census Bureau, which does not use th e electric u tility da ta to m ake its aggregated overall estim ates but does use them for som e of its lo cal area estim ates, argues that if we are getting a big increase in imm igration we should see it in the births and the deaths data. But I wonder if many illegal imm igrants hav e babies that are born in ho spitals where som ebody records the babies’ nam es. If the parents are illegal immigrants, the last thing they want to do is to have births record ed. Clearly, deaths are another issue, but if there h as been an acceleration of imm igration, th at should affect the death rate in 20 10, not now. So there is a reasonable expectation that w hen the 2000 Census com es out, it’s going to revise upward the population numbers,  the household numbers, and the household employm ent growth numbers. I might say th at it will a lso exp lain why ho using sta rts are as high as they are with household fo rmation being as low as it is. 12/21/99 51 This hypothesis fits a number of holes in the data, but it also tells  us that potential working-age population growth is higher. And, therefore, since our productivity num bers are bas ed on payroll data, rais ing the work ing-age population will obviou sly also raise the long-term  potential for econom ic growth. We won’t know until we see the prelim inary numbers com ing out of the 2000 Census, which I guess we will get in 2 002 or 2003. Mike, do you rem ember offhand when they will com e out?  Who knows how quickly that will get done with the com puters they are working with now! 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. They have to find some workers to do the census! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We m ay have  it sooner than I suggested. Who knows! All in all, m y point is that I think we  have som e statistical problem s that are not irrelevant to interm ediate- and longer-term  monetary policy. Having said all that, m y view on policy is , if I m ay reference Governor Kelley’s comment about raising his hand and saying present, that I al most think the best way we could have gotten through this period would have been som ehow to cancel this m eeting. The reason is that m arkets, as far as I can see, s eem to be pretty m uch where we as a Comm ittee would like them  to be. I don’t know whether we will want th e num bers in the currently are at appropriate levels. The crucial issue for this m eeting, as D on Kohn very clearly pointed out, is to recognize that we have a Y2K problem. It is a problem  about which we do not want to becom e complacen t and presum e that it do esn’t m atter. We want to communicate as effectively as we can that we have no inte ntion of doing anything th rough the year-end and the m arket that we retain an upward bias a nd have not com pleted th e tightening that we think need s to be done. We therefore face a tricky problem  of trying to f ind a way to communicate all of that, taking into account what  we think the m arket perceives about what we m ay or m ay not do, if our pur pose is not to disturb the m arkets one way or the other. With that in m ind, we have endeavored to craft two possible announcem ents. One, as Don mentioned, would acco mpany a “B” symm etric decis ion an d the other a “B” asymmetric case. 12/21/99 52 Accordingly, in what is a rather unusual procedure for us, I w ould like to distribute both of these drafts. 2/ The evaluation of what we percei ve the outlook to be  is the sam e in both, but it is positioned in di fferent paragraphs. And rather  than request your comm ents on specific wording preferences, I would apprecia te it if you would confine your comm ents to the alternative you feel more comfortable with, symmetry or asymm etry. I assum e that nobody here wants to raise rates at this tim e. At least I didn’t hear th at view expressed in any of the comm ents today. So, if we are goi ng to vote “B,” I woul d appreciate a ju dgment as to which of the two versions you feel m ost co mfortable with. In this regard I switch back and forth between the tw o every 10 m inutes! It just depends on what tim e I happen to be expressing an opinion. At the m oment I feel slightly m ore in clined toward asymm etry; but by the tim e we vote it is just as likely, knowing how m y view on this has changed frequently over the las t day or two, that I will b e on the other side. Frank ly, I don’t th ink our decision on this issue today m atters one way or the othe r. It’s only a question of one’s judgm ent on minor issues, and I would apprec iate any great insights. I might just note parenthetically  in reference to w hat Don said about the issue of the intermeeting bias, th at this will b e the last directive that incor porates a se ntence on symmetry on the old ba sis. However , this direc tive won’t be published u ntil af ter th e next meeting and is very likely to be an anachronism  by then, so it is not going to m atter terribly much which alternative we choose. But there is the question, as D on correctly points out, about how we want to state our consensus. So let us take a few m inutes to look at both of these versions and then I’ll ope n the m eeting up for discussio n. I might note that both of these drafts are saying, in effect, that we are ve ry likely to m ove rates at the next m eeting. [Pause] Vice Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. For som ebody who likes to have firm  views on m ost subjects , it’s difficult to have a firm view on this unless one is  a theolog ian rather than  a central  banker. I think both dr aft statem ents m ake it clear, as you ’ve said, that we will have a se rious discuss ion about policy at the Feb ruary 1st and 2nd meeting and that there is presently a bias  toward tightening at  that m eeting. And both tex ts make it clear that we will not change the funds rate until then. 2/ The language of the two drafts is provided in A ppendix 2. 12/21/99 53 What I read in the m arketplace now is a c onvictio n that the Fed will tighten but that the tighten ing will be s ensible and rea listic. I am a bit con cerned that if  we put out an asymm etric direc tive, th e marketplace would pick up not so mu ch what we think but what some observers think we think. That coul d increase the likeli hood of a tightening in difficultie s in settlem ent system s in the f irst two weeks of  next year. On the other hand, if we put out the draf t with the symmetric language--which is probably the m ost hawkish symme tric language any hum an bei ng has ever seen--I believe there is very little lik elihood that the m arkets would think the Fed is som ehow kinder, nicer and gentler so let’s rally. Even if they did th at for five m inutes, m arket participants would read the text very quickly and the markets w ould settle dow n, maybe not  within five m inutes but rather quickly. I’m basing m y view, frankly, on this being my 33rd year of very active involvem ent in financial m arkets. I think that the balance of risks is such that the symm etric language is very unlikely to have any negativ e result for us. With asymm etric language there is a po ssibility-- I’m not statin g that it’ s a certainty --that the m arket would pric e in additional F ed tightening over the course of 2000. And in my view the m arkets are just too slim and we’ve invested too m uch in the effort  to ensure th at the Y2K transition is a s mooth one to take that risk. Where do I stand on it?  I’m probably leani ng 55/45, 60/40 at m ost, toward the view that symm etric is better than asymm etric. I certainly am  not even rem otely thinking of dissenting if  there is a m ajority in the other direction. But I do have  33 years invested in looking at markets and that’s m y assessm ent of it.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. My first choice would be that at 2:15 p.m . today we issue a statem ent that says “Happy Holidays,” as I think Tom Hoenig was suggesting. It seem s likely  that in the v ery nea r future our direc tive langu age will no long er ref er to likely future policy actions but rather to the balance of  risks in the econom y. If that is the case, I don’t know why we would want to m ove from  symmetry to asymmetry with respect to future polic y action s when we will n ever do th at again. To put out a sym metric direc tive today does no harm . I doubt that there is a nybody in the world who doesn’t think that we will have a very ser ious discuss ion at our m eetin g on Februar y 1st and 2nd. I cannot imagine 12/21/99 54 that that wo uld be a surprise to any one. Everyone knows that m eeting will be a tou gh one. There will be a lot of new infor mation, and m aybe even some reliable inform ation, although I don’t kno w about that. So, I see n othing to b e gained by p utting ou t an asymm etric directive. I see potential negatives. And I don’t see a ny negatives in putting out a symmetric d irective. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. I guess I’ll take the oppos ite position, Mr. Chairm an. I can live with either o f these sta tements. But the way I heard our discussion today, this Comm ittee essentially is asymm etric and pretty clearly so ex cept for con cerns abou t the centu ry date change. And I think we ought to say so. It seems to m e that the last sentence in the m ain paragraph of the draft with asym metric langu age says it v ery we ll. The whole tone of it and the way it’s structured m ake that point very cl early. I wouldn’t expect  that to result in a way to go.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I agree with Al Broaddus that the Comm ittee is clearly anticipating,  on the bas is of what we know now, that we will m ake a policy m ove in expectation. That is what I think is the sense around the table. And I believe that the asymm etric directive draft provide s a better sense of that view .

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . Mr. Chairm an, I agree it is a close call. I think both drafts accom plish the sam e objectiv e. I happen to pref er the symmetric one. First of all, it’s technically accurate, as you pointed out, wh ereas the asymm etric one is no t techn ically accurate. If the m arkets don’ t understand it in 15 m inutes, clearly they are going to understand the language as soon as they read it. I think it’s very clear. And I agree with Jerry Jordan that, hopefully, we are going to change to a new announcem ent policy as of the this point.

MR. PARRY. I favor, by a sm all m argin, the symmetric directive as well. When I read the two, the symm etric one seem s to speak  a little m ore clearly about our thoughts and concerns. I don’t see big differences, but if I had to state a preferen ce it would be for the symmetric a lternative. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. I’m for asymm etry. It is a close call and I could live with either. But I think asymmetry is a m ore honest descripti on of where the Comm ittee is at this point. I find the grammar of the asymm etric language a little sim pler. There are fewer words like “however,” “nonetheless,” and so forth. It’s a little m ore direct and I like that. I’m also persuaded b y the fact th at it is m ore in lin e with what econo mists th ink we will do. And if our objective is to not cha nge m arkets, that wording is te lling them  that. I know you said we shouldn’t m ake wording ch anges, but let m e suggest just one. I would say a sm ooth transition “int o” rather than “to” the year  2000 to show that we are not holding steady only for another nine days. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I will accept that. Does anybody disagree? We accept you r apology! Presiden t Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. I have a m ild preference for the symm etric version. I’ve been struck in recent weeks by the fact that m arket partic ipants seem  to have been tracking right along with us. They have been interpreting the inco ming data pretty m uch as we have. I doubt that anybod y will be m isled or su rprised by th e language of the symm etric directiv e and I think th ey will continu e to do what th ey have been doing. And given that we do face uncertainties  associated with Y2K and have  inve sted a lot in avoiding Y2K-related disruptions, I don’t see any partic ular advantage to an asymmetr ic directive at  this stage. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Mr. Chairm an, I can certainly li ve with either. In my view they are almost as broad as they are l ong. I do favor the symm etric la nguage because I think it is our clear intention at this point not  to change policy, and symm etry is the way to say we are not going to raise the funds rate. I do have one c oncern--with apologies, I think! It does seem possible that this Comm ittee m ight feel forced  into an interm eeting m ove as we get into possibility, then the language of the symm etric directive tends to foreclose that when it says, 12/21/99 56 “At its next scheduled m eeting the C ommittee will assess….” I think we could fix that, again with apologies. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. How would you fix it? 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. I’d simply rem ove the word “scheduled.” 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER( ?). That’s right. We could have an unscheduled m eeting.

MR. KELLEY. Then it would r ead “at its next m eeting.”

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Like everyone else, I thi nk I could live with either. I have a slight p reference for the symmetric o ne becau se in my mind it rea lly does  put the ho rse before the cart in that it says quite clearly that first we have the rollover to the year 2000 and then we have next year. And I think it’s im portant to keep re inforcing th at sense of  priority of getting into the year 2000 and focusing then on the next m ove.

MR. BOEHNE. I prefer the symm etric directive.  This is a m eeting that in m any ways we didn’t need to have and I think the symm etric appro ach essen tially reaffirm s where we are. And it com es closest to having per ceptions after th e meeting stay exactly where they were before the m eeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. I prefer the symm etric one , Mr. Chairm an. After all we have invested in Y2K preparations, with options and special liquidity program s, changing our bias as we get to this point near the end does not  seem  to m e to be the best thing to do. To my m ind the symmetric language m akes clear to the m arket that a sm ooth Y2K transition is still our p riority and that we will get through that period before we take up  the issu e of tightening again. So, I much pr efer the symm etric directive. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. I prefer symm etry as well. I hope that won’t be interpreted as any lack of enthusiasm  for getting back to our work  after the f irst of the year. I think all th e argum ents have been m ade. To change from symm etry at this point and give people even six weeks to try to figure out why we did it and whether we an ticipate do ing som ething different soon after the first of the year is, in my view, a distraction th at we just don’t need. 12/21/99 57 I’m part of the “Happy Holidays” cam p as well.  If we could get by with doing that, I would like it very much.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I cou ld have gotten by with “Happy Holidays” as well. But given this cho ice--and not wanting to go in to any on-th e-fly editing  of la nguage--I would feel, for a lot of reasons, that asymmetry is marginally the better way to  go. First of all, I don’t like the additional words in the language for symm etry nor the focus on policy in the interm eeting period, which is afte r all very long. I believe the asymm etric language is more honest, as G overnor Gram lich said, about where we feel things are.  I think it is reflective of where the m arket is and where the m arket thinks  we are. And it gives us the opportunity to do som ething after Y2K and before the next m eeting if we want to, whereas the third paragraph of the symm etric press release I think forecloses that a bit. I’d be worried about that. I could go either way, but m y concern a bout the symm etric direct ive is the word ing “in order to indicate the focus of policy in the in termeeting period.” That’s a long period of time.

But I m ust say that the symm etric directive draft is extrem ely we ll done and I would be very comfortable with that. I feel that’s honest a nd transparent as well.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The a rguments for symm etry have won the day. I think that is what we ought to read and vote upon.  May I say before I conclude that I just raised the barrier a little: The two changes suggested were worthw hile getting. I think they both are v ery helpful. Now, the las t senten ce on each of the drafts  is bracketed because 12/21/99 58 whether we include that will depend on our subs equent dis cussion. The o ne thing I do  not think it is advisable for us to say is that the Comm ittee plans to m ake a public announcem ent in January, if for some reason we are not absolutely sure th at that is going to happen. If we’re not sure, saying it is, shal l I say, a less than thoughtful thing to do. Inclus ion of  that s entenc e does have the advan tage of indicating that we will be a ltering our policy pe rspectiv e and it reinf orces the f act tha t the symm etry issue is no t a sign ificant policy m atter. But we have to be a little car eful about forecas ting th at we will do som ething if it turns out that we are going to be unable to  accomplish that. So le t’s leave the b racketed issue for judgm ent later; that  judgm ent should be reasonably eas y to m ake after we have our discussion. Please read the directiv e accord ingly.

In view of the evidence currently available, the Co mmittee be lieves that prospective developm ents are equally likely to warrant an increase or a decrease in the federa l funds rate operating objective during the interm eeting period.”

CHAIRMAN GREENSP AN. Let us move on to consider the directive language and disclosure policy. Governor Fe rguson, would you lead us as you have in the past? 12/21/99 59 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I’d like to refer to the m emo that I sent to the C ommittee dated Decem ber 17, 1999. Let me start by sim ply reviewing th e state of play, if you will. At our last m eeting the prin cipal issues we discussed re lated to whether or not we wanted to do two things: (1) change th e directive language used to describe the Comm ittee’s assessm ent of prospective developm ents; and (2) define m ore precisely the Chairm an’s latitude for m aking an interm eeting move. On the first point, the issue was whether we wanted to move m ore toward language  about the balance of risks to describe the Comm ittee’s view of the future and move away  from  what we call “symm etry/asymm etry” today. And the consensus, though there were obj ecting points of view, was that we did want to make that m ove. You sent your Working Gr oup back to consider that language in a m ore detailed way, and revised langua ge is now in this m emo star ting on page 5. That is one point that w e need to discuss further. The second thing you asked the W orking Group to do was to consider how  best to express the Chairm an’s latitude for an inte rmeeting m ove. We took a look at the language that we had suggested and m ade som e slight adjustm ents. That is on page 5, section B. A third question em erged, involving a couple of other recomm endations from  Cathy Minehan on how to handle the directive wording. That is on page 6. The fourth issue that emerged as we proceeded was an expectation th at we would have som e form  of public announcem ent of this change in January. And the latter two pages of the m emo describe what would go into an announcem ent, though it is not a draft. Let m e also rem ind you that at our Novem ber meeting we looked at nine other areas on which there was a strong consensus within  our W orking Group, and I got no sense that there was an y change fro m what we agreed on then. That is th e state of play. Now, what I would like to do is as foll ows: Though a general consensus emerged in the FOMC and there was a clear m ajority in the Working Group that we wanted to move toward this language that focuses m ore on th e balance of risks and is more tied to our legis lative g oals, a few people s till clearly fe lt that we needed to m ake sure we are comfortable with that decision. So first I’d like to ask President Poole to give his perspective on why he as a m ember of the W orking Group still feels uncomforta ble with the balance-of-risks language. I just want to m ake sure we have thought  this through carefully 12/21/99 60 because, as pleasan t as this experien ce was, I don’t look forward to rep eating it again next year! [Laughter] So, careful thought is im portant here. Then, I would like to call on the other m embers of the Working Group to give thei r perspectives on this issue. Also, as we go around to others, I’d like to hear your t houghts not just on the balance-of-risks language but on the other elem ents in our m emo, in cluding the language on interm eeting m oves, Cathy Minehan’s proposals on the directive language, and how we should communicate all this publicly . I hope that is reasonably clear. Bill Poole, let me turn  it over to you; I see Bill has handed out a m emo. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I think I have enough copies  to go around if you’ ll keep passing them on. I wanted to put m y thoughts do wn on paper b ecause that allows m e to state th ings m ore concisely. The W orking Group’s proposal on th e balance-of-risks la nguage, what I am calling Option 1, has been slightly modified since we last discussed it. But m y major concern ha s to do with th e last part of it invo lving  a sta tement by the Comm ittee on its views about future econo mic conditio ns, and that is what I wan t to focus on . Let m e go through m y points. First, I think it is going to be m uch e asier for us to agree on a possible policy action than on a statem ent concerning possible future  econom ic conditions. Second, I believe that the Option 1 language has an im plicit Phillips cu rve analytic f ramework behind it and in m y view not every m ember of the Comm ittee will be  comfortable with that fram ework. Third, I think that many in the m arket will view the Op tion 1 language as essentially a code for the existing tilt language--th at, in f act, it will be read as a Comm ittee view about future policy. And it is im portant for us not to allow percepti ons to develop that we’re talking in code. Another issue, m y point four, is why we would be talking about econom ic conditions rather than future p olicy action.  If we are truly talking about econo mic conditio ns, why do we take a Comm ittee vote on th e matter--a s tatem ent ab out our forecast, if you w ill. So, I think the policy. Furtherm ore, I am  concerned about th e way in which the general public m ay interpret this language. I think we are inviting headlines that say “Fed sees econom ic weakness ah ead” if we vote on a directive that says we see possible econom ic weakne ss. I don’t think that is going to be helpful to us. 12/21/99 61 I’m also concerned that the language in Opti on 1 has an analytical weakness. If we are suc cessf ul in be ing p reemptive, then the chan ging econo mic conditio ns we see will lead us to tak e a policy actio n and will n ot at the end of the day create either econom ic weakness or inflation. That’s the whole idea we’re trying to get across: We see the possibility of econom ic conditions that, if not offse t by pol icy action, would  generate econom ic weakness or inflation. We want to preem pt the changes in the econom y that we don’t want to occur. So, I think the language proposed in Option 2 is really m ore accurate. The change in econom ic conditions that we see developing is going to generate policy action and will not, in fact, generate economic  weakness or inflation. Lastly, I think the m ajority on th e Working Group overreacted to the m arket’s response to our announcem ent in May. We had explicitly told the m arket that we would disclos e the tilt when the  Comm ittee wished “t o communicate to the pub lic a m ajor shif t in its views about the balan ce of risks or the likely direction of future policy.” So it is not surprising to  me that the m arket reacted when we first used th at device because we said we would announce the tilt when we had som ething major to say. In fact, since May, I think the m arket has understood that we were using this device on a much m ore routine basis. And in m y view the responses since May when we have used an asymmetric directive have been helpful and have not reflected an overreaction. So, those are m y seven reasons for having a strong preference for what I’m calling Option 2. I must say that I wish I had had th is all str aight in my m ind 10 or 12 weeks ago when I started to think about it, but my views have evolved as we’ve gone along. My initial view was one of a m ild preference fo r what I’m  calling Option 2 over Option 1. The more I’ve thought about it, the m ore I have beco me concerned about the Option 1 approach.

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you. Let m e just quickly summ arize what I think the majority of our W orking Group believes on this . I won’t go point by point, but in general I think the m ajority is concerne d that if we don’t m ake a clear  break away from  the current language, w e still risk th e possi bility that m arket participan ts will overreact, even tho ugh they are perhaps beginning to understand a little  better what we are tr ying to convey. The m ajority of our W orking Group does not suggest that th e balance-of-risks language has no im plications for future interest rates or policy m oves. But we believe that language m ore accu rately reflects w hat the Co mmittee actually an ticipat es about the future 12/21/99 62 because we all recognize that, indeed, the de cisions about po licy m oves have not yet been made when we talk abou t the ba lance  of risks. They aren ’t actually m ade until the vote occurs at a m eeting or conference call, whichever it m ay be. Therefore, we don’t want to leave too strong an im plication th at anything is baked in the ca ke. I think the m ajority felt that the existing language does leav e too m uch of that im plication. There was, just so you know, som e exchange of views on the analytics. We ended up am ong Bill Poo le, Don Kohn, Da ve Lindse y, and m yself i n disagreement on the analytics. I’ll spare all of you the details, unless you want to h ear them , but let m e just note that there is som e disagreem ent on whether Pres ident Poole has the analytics exactly right. With that brief summ ary of the m ajority perspective, let m e go to m y Working Group colle agues f irst--just in the order in which they  are sitting-- and then we will go roun d robin. Mike Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Yes, I’ll start, Roger. I don’t know that I can add m uch either to Roger’s exc ellent memo or the sum mary he just gave or to Bill’s v ery cogent dis agreement, which everyone has given an enorm ous am ount of  attention to. I’m in the m ajority that favors Option 1. First of  all, I would like to say relative to th e analy tics and other con cerns that there are sophisticated m arket analysts who m ake a very good living --I carefully do not say earn a g ood living --opining, criticizing, and question ing the Fed. Some are academ ics and they hav e academ ic purposes, an d others are either specu lating o r doin g the in tellectual work for speculators on the basis of the way th ey read the Fed. I doubt that any language exists anywhere that will for eclose this process com pletely. I don’t think either of these options or anything else anybody would be able to craft can achieve that end, m uch as I wish we could. I believe that our objective here is to be as informative as we can while en suring to the bes t of our ability that we are accurate a nd clear about wh at we actu ally say. We want to take care not to m islead the public, either exp licitly by saying more than we intend to say or implicitly b y opening u p possibilities th at we could be m isunderstood through the implications that som ebody could draw from  what we say. I think al l of our discussions have been focused on ho w best to do that. The facts are that at each m eeting where we adopt a tilt, bias, or asymmetry or whatever you want to call it--or decide not to do so--it doesn’t m ean any m ore than what our proclivity is at the tim e of that m eeting. It can’t m ean 12/21/99 63 any m ore than that because conditions always change, as we know, and considerations always change. That’s why we have a zero-ba sed review at every m eeting that we have. And the record will sho w, I think, that the tilt evaluation has very lit tle or no predictive power concerning future policy m oves over any pa rticular time period. And in m y view, we should be very careful not to l eave any im pression that it does. In my opinion, the best way to do that is si mply to place the weight of the evidence on the sca les as it relates to our two o bjectives , which we have in this proposed statem ent-­price stability on the one hand and sustainabl e growth on the other. Then we should articulate ho w those scales read at th e tim e we are looking at them . They will either b e balanced or they will be weight ed toward a danger in one direction or the other. If we feel that we have to expound further on that, it can be done through a statem ent released to the press. That is where I com e down. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you. Larry Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you. It was clear at th e last m eeting, as it has been during the deliberations of the W orking Group, that I am  part of a very sm all m inority on this issue-­about m y views because I am  strongly in favor of  language in  the tilt that refers directly to prospective policy actions. I believe the best way to think about this is  to reflect on why we are engaged in this process and what we are trying to accom plish. In my view, two concerns led to this reconsideration of our directiv e and disclosu re practices. First, we becam e uncomfortable with the m arket’s reactio n to our ann ouncem ents, particula rly with its asse ssment of  the immediacy and the certainty of a policy m ove whenever we announced a shift to an asymm etric directive. Second, there was an additional uncertainty engendered by the absence of  a consistent interpr etation of the tilt b y members of  the Comm ittee. Now, the second problem  is easy to deal with. We have  a process under way to develop a consensus, and I think we have an agreem ent around the table that whatever that consensus is w e are all going to be bound by it going forward, whethe r we agreed with it or not. But the first problem , which I’m  going to  call th e imm ediacy/cer tainty problem , resulted in large part from the decisions we made when we adopted this disclosure policy last Decem ber. First, we decided only to a nnounce a change in the tilt when the change was 12/21/99 64 significant and im portant for the pub lic to know. In retrospect, I think that was a m istake. It was as if we had said: “If we are going to have a significant change in the directive, w e want to have it flashing on that big neon si gn in Tim es Square.” And then we were surprised about how intense the m arket response was! Second, by explic itly ty ing the tilt to the interm eeting language of the directive, we  reinforced the presum ption that the bias referred to a very short-term  policy horizon. So, I think we uninte ntionally created the problem s that we are try ing to respond to today. Now what do we do? We have already reached consensus on three constructive steps to alleviate these problem s. First, we are always going to announce changes in the tilt, thus rem oving the special sense of immediacy and certainty of announced tilts. Second, we are going to rem ove the tilt f rom the direc tive and not tie it to  the in termeeting pe riod language. And third, as I noted above, we are going to agree to be bound by the consensus interpretation. What m ore do we need  to do?  Here is where we differ. The m ajority also wants to change the la nguage to focus on the balance of risks in the forecas t in order to d etach it from an e xplicit reference to policy. Two quite d ifferent reasons have been put f orth for why we should not explicitly refer to the policy direction in express ing the tilt. The f irst is tha t by not lin king the tilt d irectly to f uture policy p rospects we are tak ing a further effective step  toward reso lving th e imm ediacy and certainty p roblem . The logic is that if we don’t m ention policy, the m arkets will be  less likely to infer from the announcem ent of a tilt a sense of imm ediacy a nd certainty of a subsequent policy action. That m ay be the cas e. But I’m  not sure it will b e. The second argum ent is that we can legitim ately have an assessm ent of the balance of risks to th e forecast, b ut that it m akes no sense to have a po licy b ias because we can ’t comm it a fut ure FOMC to a policy decision. The view is that som ehow t he balance of risks is accu rate, but we can’t have an accurate po licy bias. I don ’t understand it. I’ll give you an exam ple. We sat around this table today and discussed the outlook, and I think we all were talking as if  it was very likely that w e would have to tighten policy even at our next m eeting in February. Does that m ean when February comes along that we won’t start afresh with a zero-b ased review of the  data and the  forecast?  Of course not.  Of course we will start afresh, as we are required to do. So I would reject that notion. I don’t think that’s a good argum ent. 12/21/99 65 But there is a legitim ate question as to wh ether or not the bala nce-of-risks language will deal with this certainty/imm ediacy probl em. The m arkets really want to know about our policy bias and they will inf er that policy bias however we express th e tilt. We would be deluding ourselves to think otherw ise. We can couch this bias in the language of the forecast, bu t the m arket will read rig ht through it  to our policy inten tion. Therefore, I prefer the direct, transparen t approach. Specifically, I ’d use the lang uage we’ve been using rather than this alternative language that Bill Poole has suggested. And I would use the press release to set out our interpreta tion of the tilt--speci fically, that we don’t intend it to indicate a precomm itment to action at the next m eeting, but to indicate a greater likelihood of moving in one direction rather than th e other over a longer tim e frame. If the m ajority view is ne vertheless in favor of the balance-of-risks language, I would stron gly urge that we not assu me that this language alo ne will conv ey the m essage we want to send in term s of immediacy and certainty of subsequent policy action. We should m ake these points explic itly in the press release in exactly the sam e way we would do if we used the policy bias language. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Before we continue, let m e ask if any other m embers of the Working Group want to give their perspectives or elaborate on a m ajority or m inority point of view. Mike Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW . I’ll be very brief. I just wa nt to add a couple of points. I am in the majority here; I prefer the langua ge that is in the Ferguson mem o. I just want to point out that we discussed this at great length in the W orking Group. Mem os have been exchanged, e-mails have been exchanged, and I forget the nu mber of m eetings we’ve had but it has been many. So we have discussed it at great length al ready. The key here, as I see it, is that we are trying to  educate the public ; we a re trying to get away f rom the notion  that we a re autom atically going to move at the next m eeting and that we have our finger on the trigger and are ready to act. That is  really, from  my standpoint, our  key objective. And what the Ferguson language does is to take a step back an d put the balance of risks on the table rather than the po ssible n eed for a change in the stance of policy. Larry Meyer said that the going to hap pen because over tim e they are go ing to see that it isn’t a good  predictor of  what we will do. If history is any gui de, it predicts what we are go ing to do only half of the tim e. 12/21/99 66 So, I think we m ay be able to educate the m arket over tim e. At least this takes a step back from  the notion that we are autom atically goi ng to change our policy at the next m eeting. That was driving m y thinking on this issue from  the beginning and I think the way the proposed language is phrased now follows through on that point. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Bob Parry, do you want to add som ething? 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I started out at a po sition th at was very clos e to Bill Poole’s, although I indicated that I probably c ould live with either option. I’ve moved a bit more in the direction of Option 1 recently. The advantage of Option 2, of course, is that it’s very direct. To m e the disadvantag e is that it m ay not accu rately convey th e probabilities of a chan ge in policy. Clearly, we were using th e tilt language in the past in a way that very often did not lead to a change in policy after we had adopted  an asymm etric directive. And I even worry about the possibility that m arkets m ay alm ost force us to m ake a m ove if we’ve indicated asymm etry, as has been the case once in the recen t past. With regard to Option 1, what I like about  it is that it seem s to capture how I’ve interpreted symm etry in the past: I concluded what I thought wa s appropriate with regard to the funds rate and then considered the question of where the balance of ri sks, in term s of the econom ic outcom es, wa s likely to be in the period ahead, knowing full well that things could change very quickly. So it seem s to m e that perhaps Option 1 would provide a little more f lexibility than Option 2. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thanks. Ned Gram lich is ne xt, and then we will ope n up the discussion to the rest of you. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. I’ve been for Option 1 by a close m argin all along and I still am . I think Bill Poole and L arry Mey er have put th eir case very well, but I still like Optio n 1. Let m e make three points. To m e the biggest point all along has been wh at we are calling the “trigger” issue. That involves our standing back from  policy changes a bit--being unders tated and letting the necessarily m aterialize. That has been the m ajor issue to m e throughout these deliberations. On Bill Poole’s poin t 2, regarding an im plied Phillips cu rve fram ework, I don’t th ink this language m eans at all that the FOMC is a captive of Phillips curv es. The wording that Mike Kelley worked out, which is on page 5 of Roger’s m emo, tries to make it a little 12/21/99 67 clearer that the issue is n ot so m uch that we be lieve the Phillips curve but that p rice stability and sustainable econom ic growth are our m andates. On the “talking in code” issue, I don’t consid er it speaking in code if we say exactly what we’re thinking at any partic ular point. In fact, that’s on e thing I find attractive about the balance-of-risks lang uage. So I am s till in the Option 1 camp, though Bill and Larry have weakened m y resolve a bit. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I’d like to open up the discussion now and we’ll use the usual approach. I would rem ind you that  there are a number of diff erent elem ents in the mem o and I would appreciate it if you would indicate places where you agree o r disagree. I will be assum ing that if you don’t indicate a disagr eement that you are basically agreeing with what’s in the m emo. First on m y list is Jerry Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. We know, of cour se, that what m atters from this point forward over the next tw o years or longer is what we do, not what we say. Whatever box one wants to run m onetary policy through, it’s our actions that influence econom ic activity, inflation, growth, and so on, not the words that  we use. But it seem s to m e that we’ve gotten ourselves in a situation this year where m ore and m ore focus has been on our words and the trans itory m arket reac tions to our words and that ha s taken attention away from what we do. What m attered in 1998 was that we  lowered the funds rate  three tim es; what mattered this year was that we raised the f unds rate three tim es. The reason I don’t like Option 1 is the stress on both goa ls and the way that has been  rephrased in the bracketed expression to im ply m ore strongly  that the go als are sep arable, which I d o not believ e. At a time when we would vote for asymm etry toward tightening, I would want the directive to say “weighted m ainly toward conditions that  may generate heightened inflationary pressures, which would cause econom ic weakne ss.” It is in creases in inf lation that s end false signals to m arket pa rticipants, producers, and hous eholds, and weakens econom ic growth. The other option, to leave out any refe rence to inflation at all and  say “weighted mainly toward conditions that m ay generate econom ic weakness”--that’s asymm etry toward ease, I gu ess--I don ’t kno w when we would use this option. I can’t im agine that we wo uld adopt that kind of directive unless we foresa w som ething like the Asian crisis, the Russian default, or som e other adverse shock. In such  a case I think we’d do what we believ e is th e right thing to do--cut rates, as we did in 1998--rather than announce that we’ll think hard 12/21/99 68 about it at the next m eeting. I don’t see any be nefit at all in trying to  give these kinds of signals abou t future m eetings and future actions. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Bob McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I’m persuaded by Bill Poo le’s ar guments. The argum ent he m ade that is m ost significant to m e is point 2, ha ving to do with the Phill ips cu rve. In the language of Option 1, the opposite of econom ic weakness is inflation. That’s a built-in Phillips curv e, and f or that reason I would go with Option 2. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Ed Boehne. 

[SECTION]

MR. BOEHNE. Roger, I think you and your a ssociates have done a first-rate job on this and I support the m ajority recomm endations. To m e the balance-of-risks approach is the preferred course and, se parately, I think the language  laying out the C hairm an’s authority is much im proved. And if it’s on th e table, Cathy Minehan’ s editorial suggestions also have m erit, in m y judgm ent. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. That is on the table. Al Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Roger, first, I would second Ed Boehne’s com pliments to you and your colleagues on the W orking Group. You’ve  done a lot of hard work. You’ve done a great job, I think, in fram ing the issues and ge tting them  on the table. But I continue to have reservations about two aspects of the pr oposals: the balance-of-r isks language and also the am endment to the Authori zation for Dom estic Open Mark et Operations, which has not been focused on so far. Let m e just run th rough my views on these issues as quickly as I can. On the balan ce-of -risks issue, I’m  very m uch in the sam e camp as Bill P oole and Larry Meyer, and I guess Bob Parry as well. Inevitably, in m y view, this language is going to have the effect of reinforcing the s hort- term Phillips cu rve tradeof f mentality th at pervades public discussion of m onetary pol icy in particular and of econom ic policy generally. I recognize that th e recom mended language, if read and analyzed carefully, does not necessarily im ply that the Comm ittee in its decisions assu mes such a tradeoff, alth ough the language is certainly consiste nt with that assumption. But to most readers and to most reporters in particular, th e language will al most certainly still seem  to posit a choice between fighting inflation on the one hand and stimulating growth on the other. Again, while it doesn’t necessarily follow, I think a lot of people will infer that  we are im plying that 12/21/99 69 address ing one of these two objectiv es necess arily m eans neglecting the o ther. I think  this is really im portant. The notion of a tradeoff betw een resisting inflation and stim ulating growth is deeply ingrained in Am ericans, or at le ast am ong those people who think about policy. I believ e it’s arguably the single b iggest obstacle that we face in communicating clearly  to the public about policy. And I would hate to s ee us r einforce th is pervers e idea with the recomm ended new language, which to m y mind inevitably it would do. I would m uch prefer som ething like Option 2 in Bill Poole’s m emorandum . In fact, I had written down wording that’s am azingly close to  that; it’s alm ost id entical. I don’t think anything is lost by referring candidly and directly to prospects for policy. As I think Larry Meyer said at our previous m eeting, people are not interested in our views on the balance of risks per se. They are interested in them  only from  the standpoint of their im plications for policy. I don’t think we are goin g to change that by avo iding the “P” word. And the r isk is th at we will te nd to reinforce the popular notion that th e Fed is not able to speak cl early and in a straightforward manner about policy. Let m e shift now to the proposed am endm ent to the Authorization. This is obviously a tough subject to discuss here. We have a gr eat Chairm an currently, one who takes most of the heat that is directed at the Fed, an d no one, including m e, wants to seem to be advocating restrictions on his authority to act, especially in a crisis. But I have to tell you that I have tried to think this through and I’m  still uncomfortable w ith the proposal. It repres ents a significan t and, m ost importan tly for m e at leas t, perm anent institu tional change that could serve us poorly in the long run. The idea, as it has been presented, seem s to be that we are sim ply codifying current practice or  our current understandin g about this. But if that’s the ca se, I th ink it’ s fair to ask if  we are all clearly on th e sam e page with respect to exactly what the understanding is, how we arrive d at it, and whether it’s firm ly grounded. When the am endment is m ade public, I th ink in form ed people are going to ask those kinds of questions as they try to fi gure out what we are really tryi ng to do and what we really mean. At the present tim e at least, I’m  not sure we have crisp and convincing answers to these questions. To be candid, I’m  not sure that  the current understanding has a firm basis. I’m not sure I’m  clear on exactly what th e understanding is, though I m ay be the only one here who feels that way. But that is where I am . More broadly, it seem s to m e to run counter to our federal structure. 12/21/99 70 Of course, the funda mental question involve d is whether a chairm an should have the authority, either im plicitly through som e sort of understanding or explicitly through the Authoriza tion, to act un ilater ally eve n in cl early delim ited circum stances--that is, whether it’s wise and  desirab le for the Comm ittee to c onfer that authority. Obviously, we always can. I recognize that I’m swimming upstream here and that som e people--m aybe everybody else at the table here--believe it is wise to do this. I don’t pretend to be all knowing on this and I ackno wledge that that m ay be true. But I have to tell y ou I’m  still not convinced, after having tried to assess the benefits and the risks. It seem s to m e that the gains of doing something like this, e ither explicitly or implicitly, are sm all at best. Presum ably we ’re talking here m ainly about em ergency or crisis situations. But under our cu rrent ope rating procedures, we can already accom modate increased dem ands for currency and reserves and th e interest rate im plications of  that in a crisis by am ending our funds rate target. The Chairm an and other senior System  people can and will--as they have historical ly--continue to exert strong l eadership in m anaging a crisis, using the discount window and othe r tools at our disposal. Also in such circum stances, I think m arkets would generally expect us to m ove fairly prom ptly, so that is going to get reflected in the yield curve rath er quickly in a ny event. And im portantly, in a crisis I think it’s really importan t for the public to understand that the whole Comm ittee is fully behind any action that is taken and w ill follow through on it. It is hard to im agine that they wouldn’t think that with Chairm an Greenspan at the helm , but we don’t know who is going to be Chairm an in the year 2050, for exam ple, and what the attitude m ight be. Finally, at just a practical level, with t oday’s technology--we’ve been talking about that a lot aro und this table--it’s p retty easy to get the Comm ittee toge ther quickly. So it’s not clear to m e that we buy a lot by conferring this authority. And I think the longer-term risks of doin g so--I m ean the re al lon g-term  risks,  the perm anent ins titutio nal risks--are not inconsequential. Most importantl y, it se ems to m e that it is precis ely in a cris is situation th at a Chairm an is m ost exposed to ex ternal political p ressure. Full Comm ittee deliberation  and participa tion in a situatio n like that I think is a p rotection for the System  and for the Chairm an. If the President calls, th e Chairm an can say, “I hav e to talk to the Comm ittee” and, of course, benefit from  any deliberati on that takes p lace. Also, full Comm ittee 12/21/99 71 participa tion ensures a d etailed public reco rd of what occurs, which I think is consistent with our very appropriate drift toward greater  transparency and greater accountability. The bottom  line--aga in, I rea lize I’m  swimming upstream  on this--is that I would urge the Committee to think very carefully about this. Before we do it, we should be really confident th at this is in the best inte rests of  the C ommittee an d the Chairm an in particular as well as the S ystem  and the country. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you. Cathy Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Wow, it’s hard to follow that! Let m e start with first things first. I’ve long been of the opinion that we should announce som ething after every m eeting. And if it’s the bias discussion or th e tilt discussion that gets us to the point where we are at the end of the meeting, I believe som e reflection of  that should be incor porated in the public announcem ent that will b e made after every m eeting. In fact, at one poi nt or another I think I was the one who suggested the balance-of-risks language. Nevertheless, I m ust say that a couple of Bill Poole’s argum ents really resona te with m e: point 5, the pos sible h eadlin e “Fed sees econom ic weakness ahead;” and point  6, the idea that we are supposed to be preem ptive. If we see econom ic weakness ah ead, shouldn’t w e try to do som ething about it or shouldn’t we anticipate that we could alter policy so as to offset it, along the lines President Jordan talked about?  So, I thought I’d be firm ly in the Option 1 cam p, but I can see som e benefits to Option 2, frankly. Option 2 still talks about risk s. And I don’t think it comm its us to any m ore than what the  market thinks we’re co mmitted to- -or not committed to as th e cas e may be--because tim e will de termine what we’re going to d o. Whether or not we in fact move with any greater frequency than we have to date after we change our language is what ultim ately is go ing to decid e how the m arket accep ts this. I also b elieve that the bas ic thrus t of Presiden t Poo le’s po int 7 is right as well. When we star ted th is announcem ent policy, we led the m arket to ha ve unrealistic assum ptions about what we meant by the language. And they overreacted. We encouraged them  to overreact. We didn’t m ean to, but we did. I think the situati on has gotten better since then and there’s an improved understanding of our consensus on wh ere we are going. So, I’m really on the fence and I could be a m arginal Option 2 person. Before I get to Al Broaddus’ second comme nt, let m e just say a few words on m y suggested m odifications to the directiv e language. I assum e that nobody has m ajor 12/21/99 72 objections, or you would have said so already, about what ends up bei ng just an editorial perspective about shortening the directive. What I tried to  do when I was analyzing the issues for this discussion was to go through al l of our public announcem ents for the year and rewrite them  the way they would have been written under the proposal s made at the last meeting and in Roger Ferguson’s subsequent m emo. And as I tr ied to re write the dir ectiv e, I found that all I was rewriting every month was a paragraph that focused on the m onetary aggregates, which we really don’t talk about at our m eetings. Well, Don Kohn does--excuse me, Don. I felt that that kind of laser focus on that subject  each and every m onth really didn’t serve us well. So, that was basica lly where m y sugges tions for shortening the directive cam e from . Finally, turning to what Al  was just saying, I am  a firm  believer that FOMC ever could. My understanding in term s of th is paragraph was that it was codifying an accepted po sition of th e Comm ittee that has ch anged over a p eriod of years, but tha t this wording bas ically reflected current C ommittee pract ice. I had not really asked m yself som e of the questions that Al raised  in his discussion, and I m ust ad mit they bear thinking about. So, I’m  a little on the fen ce in th at area, too. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Okay, that’s an accepta ble p lace to be. Let m e propose the following. It is now 1:00 p.m . Perhaps som e food would be helpful as a way to m ake sure that we’re s till feeling ou r best. Is food available? 

[SECTION]

MR. BER NARD. Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. We can just  break for lunch and continue the discussion during lunch. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Yes, let’s take a brief recess and continue over lunch. [Lunc h recess] 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Bill McDonough, m ay I ask you to interrupt your eating to giv e us your perspective on the issues on the table? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I am in support of the recomm endations in the Ferguson m emo in all areas. Let m e direct m yself, however, to the discussion of the Chairm an’s interm eeting authority. We are not establishing anything new . If a m ember of 12/21/99 73 the Comm ittee doesn’t k now what the current practice is, I would th ink it is a m atter of having failed to ask. When I joined the Comm ittee, I asked what the understanding was and somebody t old m e--probably Don Kohn--so I knew what it was. So, we are codifying that which already exists--m uch against my wishes  I should tell y ou, because I didn’t th ink it was appropriate for the m atter to be discussed since it already existed. The General Counsel thought it would be better to codify a practice th at already existed, and that is why we have a General C ounsel. So rather than practice law, I very reluctantly cam e to the view that we had to discuss this. The idea that we would take away the inte rmeeting author ity from this Chairm an is to me unthinkable. As for the question of wh ether a future chairm an would deserve that confidence: If som ebody were nom inated for Ch airman and I were still here and thought the person didn’t m erit that confidence, I w ould resign so I could go up to the Hill and testify about why the person shouldn’t be approv ed by the Senate. Robert’s Rules of Order dictate th e way this Comm ittee works. If at some stage the Comm ittee decided that its Chairm an had abused th is autho rity, at the n ext meeting of the Comm ittee we could say we hereby disapprove of the Chairm an’s action. And we could change the Authorization if we thought the Chairm an at the tim e was capable of abusing the author ity again. That is absolutely just a “no-brainer” application of Robert’s Rules. So I think we should recognize that it is on the advice of  the General Counsel that we are codifying a practice that already exists. And I can’t im agine why we woul d think of doing anyt hing else. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you. Gary Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Roger. Let m e comm ent first on the interm eeting authority issue that Bill McDonough just m entioned. I share Al Broaddus’ concerns and perspectives on this, but I am  persuaded when I l ook at this language that it is satisfactory. I think it does protect us adequately and I am not troubled by what has been proposed. With regard to the bias language, originally  I was in favor of the recomm endation in the m emo, Option 1. As I’ve thoug ht about it som e more, I have to say--and I realize this is not the world’s m ost constructive observati on--I’m not entirely happy with either option. The reason is that staying with som ething cl ose to the asymmetry wording we have been using does imply I think som e presumption abou t a m ove at the next m eeting, which history suggests often has not m aterialized. In Opti on 1, the option in the m emo, I don’t think this 12/21/99 74 is neces sarily a fatal flaw. But m y reservati on is  that we cou ld find ourselves from  time to time in a som ewhat awkward position of havi ng changed policy but not changed where we think the risks lie. That is quite likely and in  som e cases appropriate. But it m ay also raise the ques tion: If the Comm ittee think s that’s where the risks are, why didn’t we m ove more aggressively?  Maybe that can be handled in su bsequent statem ents or in other ways. If I had to vote, I would vote in favor of Option 1. But I m ust say I have som e reservations about both options. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. May I speak to that? I think the gene ral consensus o f the majority in our W orking Group is that, just as Gary has indicated, even if we adopt the new language in Option 1 we would provi de an explanation of a vote for a bias if we thought that was necessary. There w as a clear ex pectation th at we m ay need to have a sentence or two that would flesh out our reasoni ng just to avoid that risk. So, I think that w as thoroughly considered by the W orking Group. Tom  Hoenig is next and then Jack Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Governor Ferguson, I’ve listened to all of the argum ents, and they are all good argum ents. When I sort thr ough them, I’m  back w ith the original recomm endations of your W orking Group. We can fool with this language to the nth degree and som ething is going to be wrong with it. Your draft language talks about risks and I feel more comfortable personally talking to the pub lic about risks than I do talking about which way we are going to m ove the next tim e we take a policy action. The issue of the Chairm an’s authority to m ake interm eeting policy m oves is a tough one, Al, and I have som e sym pathy for your point of view. But it is related to a longstanding practice and this am endm ent to the Authorization does codify that practice. To my m ind, in som e ways it sets the boundaries m ore clearly. If som e futur e chair abuses the author ity, th at is som ething the Comm ittee will h ave to dea l with. But th e way the Authorization reads now gives m e a sense of c onfidence that it would be used only in the most dire circum stances, and I think the Chairm an has to hav e som e flexibility to a ct in a crisis. So, I can generally accept the Working Group’s recom mendations. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Jack Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Roger, of the two options pr esented, I rather strongly prefer Option 1 as recomm ended by the m ajority in your W orking Group. In fact, I’m  very uncom fortable 12/21/99 75 forecasting policy actio ns, which th e second opti on im plies, as Mike Kelly, Ed Boehne, and others have commented. What Bill P oole’s d issection of  Option 1 did for me was not so m uch talk m e out of it but expose what I would refer to as funda mental flaws--Gary Stern used the term  fatal flaw--or shortcom ings in what we are trying to do here, even in m y preferred option. And those flaws relate to Bill’s point num ber 2--tha t we com e here with forecasts, on which we base our judgm ent of the risks, from  very di fferent m odels. And if nothing else, that’s going to lead to continued debate, the Chairm an allowing it, about the statem ents we put out and the language we use to further desc ribe the balance of risks. Actually, m ore fundam entally troublesom e is the fact that eac h of our respective outlooks is condition al on the assum ptions we have m ade about the s tance of policy an d future policy actions. That has been dem onstr ated very vividly in our H umphrey-Hawkins discussions; we have m ade very different assum ptions at this table abou t future po licy that are em bedded in the forecasts we pro vide at Humphrey-Hawkins m eetings. It always troubles m e to see those added up and averaged  to com e up with num bers that purportedly reflect the C ommittee’s outlook, when we adm it that we have m ade very different assum ptions. The final fundam ental flaw or shortcom ing in Option 1, which I still prefer, is that we have no for mal target--no form al inflation target or GDP target or whatever--along the lines of Ned Gram lich’s comments today. That leaves open the question of risks related to what. We have not been able or willing to an swer that question. So, in my view, there are some funda mental problem s--funda mental m ay be too strong a word--w ith even the good work that th e Working Group has done. I, for one, think there is a h igh probability that, even after th ese rep airs, people are g oing to find the rep aired process s till substantia lly flawed. In fact, I feel so st rongly about it that I think we m ay want to re-open the question-­eithe r at this  point or af ter we’ve trie d these repairs--of wheth er at the end  of the day we have m ade a contribution, as we were trying to do, in terms of transpar ency. I think it is s till an open question. Finally, I have just a couple of quick co mments on Al Broaddus’ rem arks. I want to swim  upstream  a bit with Al on that issue. I, too, share the thought that  we are all trying to understand exactly what authority we have de legated to the Chairm an. Even though the 12/21/99 76 Working Group has responded to one of m y comments and tried to fix the language to address m y concerns, I still would like to s ee the circle drawn a bit tighter around that delegation. It’s very likely that if the Chai rman were acting between m eetings he would be responding to developments we could not possibl y foresee at our previous m eeting or, in fact, we would have dealt with them . I sugge sted words like “extraord inary,” or som e other term to em phasize that this autho rity woul d only apply when som ething very out of the ordinary--som e very short-term  problem  not related to the lon g-term  objec tives of  the Comm ittee--had em erged. I would be m ost comf ortable with a delegation of that kind as opposed to a m ore open-ended delegation, which I’m less than com pletely certain could be fixed after the fact. I just think it w ould be  better to do that. Thank you for the chance to comment. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you. Let m e tell you where we are and then w e have to 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. May I ask a question just for clarification? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Sure. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Suppose we had been operating under Option 1 at the October meeting and had adopted an upward tilt--using the balance-of-risks la nguage--and then at the Novem ber meeting raised rates as we did. Do you think we would have retained that tilt with the balance-of-risks language or take n it off as we did under the old approach? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I’m not terribly comf ortable speculating about that. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. But to raise ra tes and then  take off the balance of risks toward higher inflation would seem  peculiar. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I think there are two ways we m ight have  handled it. Again, this is speculation; what we would have done, I’m not sure. We might have decided that the balance of  risks was still tilted towa rd greater inflation but decided to take a “wait and see” approach because we already would have m ade three m oves. So it is quite conceivable, Jerry, that w e could have said  at that m eeting that we we re not sure about the likely direction of our next m ove. The risks m ight be in the direction of greater inflation, but we would have wanted to be quite clear that we  were waiting to see because w e already had made three moves. Or we m ight have taken the view at that tim e that we had now done three m oves and, in effect, we thought we were out of this for som e time and in a wait-and-12/21/99 77 see posture. Therefore, we r eally thought that after these m oves the risks were balanced. Now, where we would have ended up would ha ve depended very m uch on how close that call was about where we thought the econom y was going to be after the third m ove. That’s why it’s hard to say. One could have m ade a cas e either way, if I reca ll the m eeting. That’s one of the com plications here. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. And one would have to try to do that within the context of what we knew at that tim e--

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Absolutely. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. --not what we know today, which is considerably m ore. More weight has been given to the risk of inflati on than we knew would be  the case at the tim e that statem ent would have been m ade. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Yes. In hindsight, obviously, we’d know som ewhat m ore. Let m e summ arize what I have heard and where I think we are. In som e sense not surprisingly--though there are som e caveats and a few people are in between--we still seem to have, as we did the last tim e, four people who feel on the core ques tion of the balance of risks that the current language  is clearly preferab le. We have one person actually who would prefer neither. Then everybody else se ems to feel, though they see som e faults or have som e concerns, that the balance-of-risks language is a step forward. We have two alternative courses of action. One alte rnative is simply to vote today on the recomm endations in the  memo--and this in some sense depends on the strength of our convictions on this--which will then set th e grou nd rules for next year. That strikes me as a reasonab le alternative, k nowing that we have f our people wh o will prob ably be uncomfortable about it but that everyone else, generally speaking, is ready to vote. The only other choice, frankly, is to say--and the W orking Group m ay disagree because we have put in as m any hours as we can on this to get the i ssues on the table--that we don’t want to move forward on this. But if the Comm ittee as a whole thinks we shoul d not, recognizing that there are four people who clea rly agree and don’t want to m ove forward, then that is a Comm ittee decision. I would be concerned ab out that decision because, effectively, it would m ean that we are stuck with the status quo, and I’m  not sure that that’s ter ribly attractive. And frankly, after working on this for several m onths, I’m  not sure that further discussion either in January or at the February m eeting is going  to help us go any further. 12/21/99 78 The only other thing that m akes this question co mplex is that we have  to handle what goes into today’s announcem ent. But I think we s hould leave that question to one side. Larry Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. We have gone through a process here and we have reached a consensus. It’s a quite overwhelm ing cons ensus, though it’s not 100 percent. So I’m perfectly satisfied that the process has worked. I got the chance to try to persuade others to my viewpoint and I was unsuccessful. And I would certainly consider m yself bound by this consensus, so I think we ought to vote. 

[SECTION]

SEVER AL. Agreed. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Well, Larry Meyer has pr oven him self to be not just a great econom ist, but a diplom at. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH. And a gentlem an on top of that! 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Well, we knew he was that ! If that’s the case, Mr. Ch airman, could you ask for a m otion on this? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. In the past, Governor Fe rguson, we haven’t actually had form al Comm ittee votes on m atters such as these. But, obviously, you m ight want  to see a show of hands to m ake sure that people could “live with” the decisions. Among other things, the Comm ittee has often wanted to include ever ybody, even nonvoting m embers, on these kinds of decisions since they have to  live with the consequences. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, on a matter like this, it’s everybody. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. It’s clearly everybody. I was thinking more of just a show of hands from  all, not dividing it by m embers and nonm embers. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH. I think it m ight be helpful to  take each of the m atters separately. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Fine. We will go through the m emo and basically h ave a show of hands on each issu e, still being qu ite dem ocratic. Section o ne dealt with nine general points on w hich there w as consensus. I heard no one dispute those, but let m e just ask for a show of hands on Section one, which deals with the nine points. Is there general agreem ent for those?  There seem s to be no objection on that. In Section two, I will tu rn your atten tion to  the b alance-of-ris ks language at the top of page 5, which has been the focus of m ost of our conversation. All in f avor of adopting 12/21/99 79 that as the w ay to deal with our perspectiv e on the future, please raise your hand. Okay. And those opposed?  There are four opposed. At the bottom of page 5 in Section B is langu age dealing with  the Chairm an’s latitude for interm eeting moves. All in favor of handling the interm eeting latitude that way and m aking it a part of the Authorization when we vote on that in February raise your hand. Any opposed? 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Two opposed. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. In Section C on page 6, Cathy Minehan has proposed a slight rewording of the directive. Although Cathy referred to it in our go-around, we did not have much discussion on it. Let m e just ask for a show of hands on the language, which is actually on the top of page 7 in Section C. All in favor of that approach?  Those opposed?  I see none opposed. I think we are clear on what we are g oing to do with respect to the directive when we get to February. We have a new approach that  I think has been determ ined dem ocratically. Let m e talk about the next step and then give som e guidance. The plan, as you can see on pages  7 and 8, is that we will issue a pre ss rele ase som e time in Jan uary tha t describ es the major substantive chan ges tha t we have m ade. The expectation is that everyone will have a chance to look at a draft of  that press release and send comments back to me or Da ve Lindsey or Don Kohn. So, ever yone will hav e a chance to review it. That will be the way we communicate to the public what our inten tions were in m aking th ese changes. Then in Februa ry we will s tart us ing th is new proce dure. Are th ere any ob jections to that approach?  Hearing none, I assum e there are no objections. Now we can turn to the next issue, wh ich is the announcem ent for today. You m ay recall that the Chairm an pointed out the bracketed language at the bottom  of the draft press release. Lynn Fox has now taken away all th e copies of that announcement. Lynn, could you just read that bracketed language? 

[SECTION]

MS. FOX. The last sentence was: “Separately, the Comm ittee indicated that it plans in January to m ake a public announcem ent about future adjustm ents to its disclosure policy and the so-called ‘bias’ s tatem ent.” 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Does anyone have an obj ection to including that sentence in today’s announcem ent?  Yes, go ahead Peter. 12/21/99 80 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Could I just give a perspect ive from the m arket? In m y view, if you put out that statem ent, it’s like putting up a neon sign that says. “Com ing soon: A big change in our bias!” I just don’t think the market is going wait and give you a chance to draft a well crafted press release.  The crescendo of in terest in that, I think, is going to be extrao rdinary. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. That’s a good point. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH. I think that’s a good point. Let’s just put out the pres s release when it’s ready in J anuary. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Does anyone ha ve a counterpoint to that? 

[SECTION]

MS. FOX. One reason to include it in toda y’s statement was to m ake sure that the be announced later. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. I don ’t think that ’s really necessary. The p ress release on our vote today was pretty clear. It’s unam biguous. That issue could su rface, but I d on’t think it will. 

[SECTION]

MS. FOX. Our stance then, when we’re as ked about the Co mmittee’s d ecision, is to say that we have nothing to announce, period? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH. Right. At leas t the truth will se t you free! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That brings us to  the end of our agenda, except for the pro form a announcem ent that our next m eeting- -as I’m  sure you’re all acutely aware--is scheduled for February 1st and 2nd. Merry Christm as everybody and hopefully a Happy New Year!
