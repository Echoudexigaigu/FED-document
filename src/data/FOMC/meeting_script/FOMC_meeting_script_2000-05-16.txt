CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good morning, everyone.  The changed structure of the seating around the table today reflects a desire to get a bett er perspective on the economy!  [Laughter]  Actually, this type of seating arra ngement has worked out very well at our regular Board meetings.  But if it doesn't work for th e FOMC, we can always go back to the way we were before. This is Mike Prell’s fina l meeting.  Mike goes back into antiquity with the institution.  Mike, have you ever missed a meeting? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.   I’ve missed a few. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So, he may in fa ct be uttering his last official words here today.  But like many of our colleagues who ha ve left, his imprint clearly is going to be on us for a good long time.  And if we happen to  get off track after th is meeting, somebody is going to do a regression that I don't think any of us  is going to like!  In any event, Mike, we wish you well. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We will have many occasions to say that to you before you leave.  There is still a fairly large number of days before your official retirement.  As you know, at today’s luncheon we're going to bid our official farewell to Ed Boehne.  Obviously, Ed is not participating in our  meeting today; and Bill  Stone is here with us this morning to repres ent the Philadelphia Bank.  Would somebody like to move the approval of the minutes of the last meeting?

MR. FISHER.  Over here, Mr. Chairman!  [L aughter]   There is a package of charts and text in front of you, which on the firs t page has a summary of my remarks. 1  Let me apologize in advance for th e length of my report.  I will try to cut to the chase.  Also, I s hould note that all the typos in the written material are my own, as yest erday I engaged in the illusion that last-minute changes result in improvements.   I will discuss domestic market developments with respect to policy expectations in short-term ra tes, movements in the euro as a consequence of capital flow leads an d lags, and the current shape of U.S. yield curves.  With respect to domestic operations I plan to cover four topics, including the mix of operations since the previous meeting, current conditions in the Treasury market, and the impact of Federal revenues and Treasury refunding plans on the flow of new Treasury issuance and System operations.  Then I woul d like to present to the Committee a proposal for interim System operati ons that I’d like to discuss with the Treasury.  And at the end of my remarks I will remind you about some foreign matters on which I sent you a memo.  Turning to the second page of the package, which shows forward rates, you can see in the top panel th at U.S. forward rates have risen sharply since mid-April, when they had dipped a little following the release of the CPI and more impor tantly the stock market turmoil around mid-month.  Since then they  have moved up, most briskly on the release of the ECI on April 27th and then again a little on the publication of the nonfarm payroll report on May 5th.  It is interesting to note, however, that compared with  the peak of these forward rates just after your last meeting, the 9-month forward 3-month rate-- the top dashed line--is only 25 basis points higher whereas the 6-month forward 3-month rate--the solid red line--is 45 basis points  higher.  There is some “collapsing in” of the market’s expectations of how far the Committee is likely to go in tight ening, even as more aggressive actions are being priced in over the near term.  In the middle panel, you can see that euro forward rates have backed up from their low levels in essentially three steps over the period.  First, they moved up as the euro broke below 95 cents; then they rose quite modestly after the ECB raised rates 25 basis points on April 27th and rose again after the May 2nd release of euro area M3                                                  1 A copy of the material used by Mr. Fish er is appended to this transcript.    5and the purchasing managers’ index.  The market certainly has a sense of backing up and raising forward ra tes in Europe as the euro has weakened.  The bottom panel depicts Japanese forward rates, which have drifted lower over most of the in termeeting period and spiked down on the release of the negative hous ehold spending number on May 9th.  It has been my impression during this period that the Bank of Japan has been waving its arms in the air, tr ying to get people’s attention and communicate that it might actually rais e rates at some point.  I think the market is under-assessing the ear nestness with which the Bank of Japan is trying to send that signal.  It is very much my sense that Bank officials feel somewhat as our Chairman did in 1993 and early 1994:  They are trying to warn everyone th at a rate increase is coming and no one is listening.  Turning to page 3, I would like to  talk a little about the euro’s weakness, which I see as a function of two factors.  The principal factor is the exceptional leads and lags in capital fl ows, which have been punctuated, if you will, by the extraordinary cyclical developments in the United States ov er the last couple of years.  Each of the three panels shows data fo r the 17-month period on either side of the January 1, 1999 launch of the euro.  The top panel depicts        2- and 10-year U. S. and German sw ap rates and a 10-year Italian rate up until the launch of the euro, and then the dollar and euro rates after that time.  In the middle panel are the euro/yen and euro/dollar exchange rates.  And the bottom pa nel shows the Italian stock market in purple, the S&P 500 in red, and the German stock market in blue, all indexed to August 1, 1997.  Looking back over this period, it s eems to me that non-European investors bought the rumor of the eu ro before its launch.  You can see that in the rally in Italian and Ge rman 10-year swap rates and also somewhat in the Italian and German  equity markets in late 1997 and into 1998.  And talking to people ov er that time period, there were anecdotal reports of a flow of non-Eu ropean capital into the euro zone as investors bought the rumor of the creation of the euro.  During this same period, euro-zone businesses braced themselves for the launch of the euro by hoarding cash.  Many of  us no doubt remember Governor Trichet of the Bank of France complaining repeatedly about how their corporate sector was hanging on to high levels of cash--building up a war chest for the more competitive environment they expected with the launch of the euro--rather than investing.  Since the introduction of the eu ro, it appears that European businesses have actually been diversif ying out of the euro area, as FDI  6and portfolio flows away from the eu ro zone have picked up.  That seems to me to reflect an effort on their part to catch up with the process of globalization and divers ification that has seen U.S. corporations at the forefront.  Now,  inward investors into the euro area--and the intermedia ries who bought the euro exposure from the outward investors--all hung on, wa iting for the strong euro to materialize around the start of this y ear and expecting finally to get the rally they had been looking for.  But this was just when U.S. cyclical developments gave them the “double whammy,” if you will.  The last quarter of 1998, as investors were anticipating the launch of the euro, was just when this Committee was easing rates.    There was much excitement a bout whether there would be an economic slowdown and there were stra ins in the markets.  At that point the spread between 10-year U.S. and German swap rates stood at 80 basis points and the spread between  their 2-year swap rates stood at 120 basis points.  Since then those swap spreads have doubled.  The 10-year U.S./euro swap spread is  190 basis points and the 2-year spread is 240 basis points.  While those who were hanging on to euros were hoping for the euro to rally and the U.S. economy to slow down, just the reverse has happened.  If you look at the bottom panel and the recent equity rally, you can see that the one place from wh ich U.S. equity values might look cheap would be Milan; that is just one of the head fakes that occurred to the exchange market.  Everyone expected that the hiccup of the 

[SECTION]

NASDAQ in U.S. equity markets in April might be the occasion to spark a rally in the euro.  On the contrary, it appears that European businessmen, looking at their mark et valuations vis-à-vis U.S. valuations, saw that hiccup as a buying opportunity.  And from the newspapers, which one has to follow to see these developments before they get picked up in the data, one can read about a continued flow of deals involving European pur chases of U.S. assets.  The euro bounced up at the end of last week amid a hail of discussion and threats of interventi on by prime minist ers and central bankers and finance ministers from  all over Europe; but the bounce was not much more than one would ha ve predicted even  without all of that rhetoric.  To me, the fact th at it got only that rather marginal bounce was again a somewhat bearish sign for the euro.   Let me briefly cover the material  on domestic yield curves on for U.S. Treasury securities, intere st rate swaps, Fannie Mae issues, and Ford Motor Company debt.  The yield curves shown are as of the close of the day of your last meeti ng and as of last Friday. As you can  7see, the U.S. Treasury yield curve is  a little higher but also a bit more inverted than it was at the time of yo ur last meeting.  All three of the non-Treasury yield curves have more or less backed up by around 50 basis points, or maybe a little less.  Thus credit is more expensive than it was at the time of your last meetin g.  But even with credit spreads widening to quite wide levels by the st andards of the last  several years, my impression is that habitual notions of appropriate spreads to Treasuries are still exerting a downw ard pull at the long end on all non-Treasury issues.  Treasuries are acting as somewhat of a magnet, pulling the long end of these yield curves down.  Turning to domestic operations, I have outlined on page 5 some key points regarding our mix of ope rations since your March meeting. At that meeting I spelled out my plans to try to determine what would be a comfortable pace of outri ght purchases of Treasury coupon securities.  I said that  I thought we could targ et 35 percent for our participation in Treasury bill auctions  but would allow that to go up to 40 percent in the next month or so, as we expected bill sizes first to shrink and then to rise again later in  the year.  I also noted that we would use a mix of 30-, 60-, and 90-da y repos to meet the balance of reserve needs and that we would not be purchasing bills outright until after the Treasury’s refunding announcements.    In response to views expressed by Committee members and my assessment of changing market cond itions, we in fact purchased $4.2 billion in coupon securities on five  different days.  The principal constraints were the Treasury’s buy -back operations and the novelty of those operations being quite a big de al in the market.  The Treasury had a rather big window, a two-day no tice window.  That eliminated a number of days when we might have been tempted to operate.  We also purchased $2.3 billion in bills for System account on learned something by doing.  On the first day of the quarter,                                                                                                                                                                                                                 That was not               something I was expecting to wake up to that m                                                                              orning; their request was a consequence of their inte rvention the prior evening.                                                                                            it seemed to me that the bill market adjusted rather well to that rathe                                                                                      r large effect on supply.  So, on behalf of the Committee, we purchased $2.3 billion of bills on April 11th for our own account.    We redeemed $1.6 billion of securities at auction--$977 million in bills and $568 million of the last 7-year note.  We now hold 40 percent of two bill issues.  But on two ot her issues that we anticipated  8bumping up our share to 40 percent, we ended up with a lesser share of the total outstanding as a conseque nce of the large add-ons                               And the Treasury in this case ended up with more cash th  an they wanted.  Occasionally we have used 28-day repos to meet our underlying reserve needs.  We now  have four separate 28-day repos on our books for a total value of $8.2 billion.  Most  of our repo operations over this period have been for only a few da ys’ duration because of the great volatility in the Treasury’s account.  On the next page of charts I have  tried to convey a picture of the conditions in the markets in which we  operate.  My assessment is that the bill market has made a reason ably smooth transition to the new supply conditions it is encountering.  But I think the long end of the curve is having a harder time making that adjustment, in part because of the abrupt changes in supply and obviously in part because of the policy actions this Committee has been taking.    The upper left chart depicts bid/ask spreads on 3-month bills going back to January 1997.  You can see the increases in those spreads in January 1998 when the su pply changes were beginning to come through to the bill market and then the dramatic spikes reflecting the chaos of October 1998.  But over the last six months or so the spreads have about stabilized in th e bill market.  In the bottom left panel are bid/ask spreads on the 10-y ear note.  While they seemed to be stabilizing last year at higher levels than prio r to the crisis period of 1998, the trend now is a continuing wi dening of bid/ask spreads in the 10-year note market.  On the right-hand side of the page are spreads of the 3-month bill to LIBOR and of the 10-year note to  the 10-year swap rate.  I would just note that in the 10-year area we  are still seeing a widening out of the spreads, which is merely an other reflection of the greater uncertainty the market faces at the long end.  Moreover, even though the spread of the 3-month bill to LI BOR is volatile, I think it is more or less staying in a modest range th at gives the market some comfort.  On page 7, Mr. Chairman, I have outlined recent developments with respect to Federal revenues, su rplus estimates, and the Treasury’s refunding plans.  These developments  obviously have an impact on the flow of new Treasury issues and on Sy stem operations.   At the end of  9early May the Treasury announced its intentions to buy back no more than a total of $30 billion this calendar  year, reiterating what it has said previously.  However, I think mo st knowledgeable observers expect the Treasury to be buying back more next year.  Treasur y officials also stated at the time of the May ref unding that they would maintain the 10- and 30-year programs.  But I th ink that statement also was about this calendar year.  In my view, the 30-year program is at some risk going forward at least with  this Administration.    They also announced their intention to eliminate the 1-year bill once Congress adopts some technical amendments and to trim the size of the 2-year monthly note auctions . They indicated, too, that further increases in revenue would likely le ad to a switch from monthly to only quarterly 2-year note auctions.  In addition, although this has not been announced, the Treasury has to ld us that the amount of bills likely to be issued each week for the rest of this year will be reduced by more than 20 percent.  That means the amount auctioned weekly will be down to $16 billion for the rest of the year, not just for the brief period in April and May that  we were anticipating.   These reductions in the Treasury’ s issuance plans obviously have implications for our operations this year.  The table on the next page, remainder of the year, projections of  the percentages to be purchased by the System, and estimates of the System’s net redemptions.  I won’t go through all of it with you, but I’d highlight the top two rows.  The first row shows the Treasury's issuance plan by refunding quarters, hand box are the figures projected in  March--that is, what we were looking at around the time of your last meeting.  Going across the page, the next box shows what our holdings would have been.  And the next box indicates what our net redemptions would have been under the plan of holding up to 40 per cent of any one issue this quarter but going back down to 35 percent for the rest of the year.  On the right-hand side of the page, the next three boxes show you the currently projected figures for those same variables--the Treasury’s issuance plans, the reduction in our holdings under the 35 percent objective, and our implied redemptions.  But now the implied redemptions become somewhat more material in maintaining the 35 percent limit.  For the 2-year note, for example--the next set of boxes, which I have put in bold print--t he percent of our holdings as a consequence of the reduced size of the Treasury's offerings would be moving up significantly. Moreover, that  still assumes monthly auctions and we face the risk going forward of the Treasury cutting back to quarterly auctions.  10 Let me go over with the Committ ee a proposal for interim System operations that I would like to di scuss with the Treasury.  The key points are summarized on page 9.  At  your last meeting, I thought we might be able “comfortably” to pu rchase outright up to $20 billion in Treasury securities.  In light of  both Committee members’ views and the changes in the outlook for new i ssuance, I have tried to devise a means to increase the amounts we would be purchasing.  Given the uncertainties the Treasury faces in debt management and the impact of our operations on their primary and s econdary markets, I would like to inform them in advance of my plans for managing the System Open Market Account (SOMA) over the co ming months, in part to permit them to adjust their strategy.  It  will also be v ital for us to communicate clearly to market partic ipants any changes we make in our strategy.  In brief, I would like to operate SOMA on a schedule for participation in Treasury auctions that essentially locks in the status quo in the percentage of SOMA’s holdings acquired in the primary coupon securities, skewing our purch ases both to the middle and the shorter end of the yield curve.  We would also need to rely on 28-day repos to meet the reserve needs that cannot be filled through this process and to serve as a buffer be tween the timing of redemptions and outright purchases.    I have provided for your information a very rough approximation of just three of the reserve factors we face over the coming months, from now until the end of Januar y.  Our current underlying reserve need for this period is $21 billi on.  The implied redemption from the 35 percent bill limit would be $42 billion.  And the New York staff forecast of 8.5 percent growth in cu rrency adds $22 billion, for a total of $85 billion.  I want to be very clear that this figure takes into account only three reserve factor s.  We know there will be demonetizations of SDRs that will a dd to reserve needs, and we face a risk that the Treasury’s cash balan ce will be higher and spill over into further reserve needs.  So this is not a topside estimate of our reserve needs.  We know other factors wi ll tend to add to those needs.  Turning to the next page, as I ha ve indicated there, we face both a stock and a flow problem that we are trying to address.   As a number of you noted at the last meeting, wi th over $3 trillion in marketable Treasury debt outstanding it seems clea r that we ought to be able to find sufficient assets to grow th e SOMA balance sheet from the existing stock.  However, the amount of marketable Treasury securities outstanding with remaining maturities of more than 10 years,  11exclusive of SOMA holdings, totals only $433 billion.  And that amount will decline as a consequence of both Treasury buybacks and System purchases.  There is also strong demand for these long-duration assets in foreign and domestic  private portfolios, as reflected in the inverted yield curve.  While relatively comfortable with private credit risks for shorter duration assets, investors perceive few acceptable long-term substitutes for Treasury securities.  Thus the stock of such Treasury issues is no t large relative to apparent demand and that stock is expected to declin e.  The total flow of new Treasuries reaching the securities market has continued to decline, with total issuance exclusive of cash management  bills falling from a little over $2 trillion in 1997 to $1.7 trillion this y ear.  As I have tried to explain at previous meetings, my concern is this:  If the growth of the System’s balance sheet absorbs an expanding share of both the primary and on-the-run issues too quic kly, there is a risk that System operations will come to be seen as a major disturbance, even if only transitional, in the pri ce discovery process.   Briefly, it seems to me that we have some very basic portfolio objectives in that we have a preference for Treasuries as an asset class to grow our balance sheet.  We ha ve over time had a preference for the shorter rather than longer maturity issues.  We have expressed that preference principally through our large holdings of bills, whose growth has been relatively limited in recent years.  But some members of the Committee have expressed fru stration to me that, with the reduction in the size of the bill auc tions, the average duration has been creeping up rather than going down.  The concerns center on our interest in maintaining sufficient short maturity assets to provide us with adequate maturity liquidity.  It also strikes me that it is not obvious that we have much of an in terest in paying a premium for the special liquidity of on-the -run Treasury securities.    In the current setting, it seems to me that th e Treasury has three paramount debt management objectives .  The first is to reduce the issuance of debt in line with reve nues.  The second is to avoid a lengthening of the average maturity of its outstanding debt.  And the third is to maintain issue sizes and key benchmark maturities to sustain an active secondary market.  In trying  to reconcile these interests, it seems to me that we could limit the System’s share of the primary market and on-the-run issues in order to leave room for private demand, particularly for long-duration s ecurities, as investors adjust to the reductions in suppl y.  We could expand Sy stem holdings of off-the-run and shorter-duration Treasury  securities to meet our balance sheet needs, in the process of acquiri ng as much of the preferred asset class as possible, and adjust SOMA to  a shorter overall maturity that is  12closer to our basic preference.  Doin g this will have an impact on the average maturity of privately held Treasury de bt outstanding.  The particular proposal I am making is outlined on the next page.  Let me say in advance that there is nothing magic about these numbers and percentages.  They represent my best seat-of-the-pants judgment at this point and if someone has a be tter idea, I am all ears.  But my suggestion is that we maintain r oughly the status quo of our existing holdings as the share of SOMA pa rticipation in upcoming auctions; that would involve taking shares of the now-anticipated size of offerings in accordance with the per centages shown in the schedule at the top of page 12.  We would tell the U.S. Treasury in advance that SOMA’s bids at auctions would be the lesser amount of SOMA’s maturing holdings or the percentage limit from the schedule.  This would have only a very limited im pact on our currently forecast rollovers.  But in the event of furthe r declines in issuance, this would hold constant the System’s share of the primary market and, therefore, should increase the amount availabl e for private demand from what it would have been otherwise.  It al so should assist the Treasury in forecasting and thus managing its cash  position, which is an incidental benefit of some consequence to the Desk.  We would also take the schedul e to imply a graduated set of guidelines for SOMA outright purchases  of off-the-run issues.  Over time we would make outright purch ases in the primary market under the following schedule: up to 15 per cent of securities with remaining maturities between 10 and 30 years; 15 to 20 percent of securities in the 5- to 10-year area; 20 to 25 percen t of securities in the 2- to 5-year range; and 25 to 35 percent of securi ties with a remaining maturity of under 2 years.  Also, we could perh aps continue to bid as we have been for 5 percent of inflation inde xed securities at auction, and we might be prepared to bump that up to 7.5 percent in the secondary  Page 13 shows in the second row the very marginal impact this would have on net redemptions.  There would be no change in the bill redemptions and we would have rather modest redemptions of the      2-year note if we applied this  schedule to our primary market operations.  But we would share in the upside risk that the market would experience if issue sizes declin e.  In that case we would be taking smaller nominal amounts a nd our redemptions would grow.  The chart on the next page tries to  depict the opportunity we have to implement this plan.  This s hows SOMA holdings as a percent of the size of outstanding issues.  The blue bars are bills and the other colors show coupons in various rema ining maturity brackets.  The bold  13red line represents the proposed guideline graduated for each and every issue in the Treasury yield curve.  The white area under the red line gives you a sense of the size of  the opportunity we would have to purchase these issues if we skewed  our demand toward the shorter end of the maturity spectrum.  Turning to page 15, I have shown that a very rough calculation of the amount available for purchase us ing this schedule would be around $178 billion.  We would continue ou r current practice of waiting to purchase new issues until they are th rice off-the-run.  This compares with a comparable reserve need of $88 billion through the end of note.  Again, I want to emphasize that these numbers are very rough and intended for illustrative purposes.  The pace of outright purchases could have a strong impact on the Treasury yield curve, tending to prod uce lower yields, and at least in the short run could be seen as being at cross purposes with the Committee's policy actions.  This could also be seen as a reverse operation twist even though it is motivated, in my opinion, by the System’s reasonable portfolio objec tives.  I doubt that we could comfortably purchase the full amoun t of our reserve needs for the remainder of the year--$80 billion to $90 billion--under this schedule within the next six or seven months.  But provided we communicate clearly to market participants abou t this radical change in SOMA's secondary market behavior, I think we could purchase considerably more than the $20 billion I was suggesting at your last meeting.  One of the features of this plan is th at we would be limiting our purchases at the long end and leaving the market  a little more leeway to express its demand there.    Finally, I would remind you that th is is clearly ju st a stop-gap measure.  It delays the onset of problems meeting our reserve needs.  If Treasury’s supply were to begin to expand over the coming year or so, we would have assets to roll into.  However, if Treasury’s supply continues to decline over coming year s, SOMA's need for new assets would only have been delayed.  Let me turn now briefly to the recommendation I sent to the Committee in a memorandum on May 11th regarding the renewal of our swap arrangements with Mexi co and Canada and noting two changes in our investment practices .  The latter do not require a Committee vote.  I will need a vote to  ratify our domestic operations, Mr. Chairman, and a separate vote to  approve the renewal of our swap  14arrangements.  I would be happy to answer any questions and, again, my apologies for taking so much of the Committee's time.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  On the contrar y, I thought that was an exceptionally worthwhile presentation.  Indee d, it strikes me that you at least have come to grips with the concerns that I had at the last meeting.  Wh at you did not mention is that the on-the-run/off-the-run spreads, which have been a measure of illiquidity in the sy stem, are going to be arbitraged down.  And that is probably a valuab le thing to have happen; it is very clearly desirable for any market.  Why the spreads betwee n riskless assets with the same maturity are as large as they are, wholly on the grounds of the degree of li quidity, doesn’t strike me as something that is altogether desirable.   Secondly, unless I misunderstand the nature of the program, you will be picking up a number of issues.  And in the low probability event that indeed  we run out of issues for the public by 2013--or sooner the way it is going--the  Treasury won’t have to go into the market to bid for those securities.  We in effect will  have swapped them out with the Treasury and there would be no market pressure .  Effectively we are pre-reti ring the issues for the Treasury, and that is not a bad idea.  Now, no one can fo recast with any degree of accuracy what the federal budget surpluses are goi ng to be in the future.  And obviously no one can make a judgment as to whether this program is more than just a stop-gap measure on the way to the disappearance of the Treasury market, in which case  this is all moot.   But all in all, I think you have succeeded in proposing that we do some thing that, frankly, we probably ought to have done in the past, which is to emphasize off- the-run issues.  Essentially, an endeavor to move the liquidity premium from on-the-run to tw ice or thrice off-the-run issues with sheer money market mechanics strikes me as a desira ble thing to do in a ny event.  So, while you  15

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  On a wholly diffe rent issue, let me just quickly ask a question.  Baas tend to sell at somewhat lower interest rates than BBBs.  BBBs are 10-year maturities and Baas are somewhat longer.  Is that  the difference?  In other words, is it the longer maturity that's creating the spread or is there a real risk difference between Moody's Baa and Standard and Poor’s BBB? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  You got me! CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  A rare event!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  You are kind to say so! CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This has nothing to do with this particular meeting, but if you could give me an answer on that later I’d appreciate it. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes, we will look in to that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Br oaddus.  Where is he?  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH .  He’s to your right!  [Laughter]  16

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I wanted to ask a quest ion--or I guess more accurately state an opinion--about the swaps.  Is that proposal on the table now?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. MR. BROADDUS.  What really worries me is that the continued existence of this facility puts us in a position where we can be dr awn into actions that we may not want to be drawn into at some point.  I question whether that  is desirable.  In my view it is not.  I'm talking, of course, specifically about Mexico.  The situ ation is very different now from what it was in 1994 when this swap was originally implemented.  The Mexican economy is considerably stronger and the pe so is floating reasonably succe ssfully.  So I just wonder whether this would be a good time to get out of th is swap, as we've gotten out of nearly all the others. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think you are raising a good point.  I wouldn't think, with the Mexican election on the horizon, that this is the ri ght time.  But I do believe it we would need to consult with the Treasury Depa rtment on this.  But at the appropriate time I think we ought to raise this issue.  These swaps,  which were put in pla ce in an earlier period--and most of which we have eliminated--have ha d their day and are a tr ue anachronism.  But they still have a political value.  And until we  can dissipate the political value, it probably would be difficult to unwind them.  But the notion that they will be implemented is as remote as our running out of Treasury secur ities.  [Laughter]  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  My comment wa s going to be along that same line, that this absolutely would not be the time to fa il to renew the swap arrangement with Mexico.  That action could be far too easily misinterpreted .  However, a year from now we will have a  17new Administration in Mexico and maybe a new minister of finance and central bank head, and a new head of the central bank in Canada.  So before we get to this point in 2001, I think it might at least be worth exploring with th e Mexicans and Canadians an exit strategy from these swaps.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. MR. GRAMLICH.  I have two questions for Peter.  First, on page 15 of his handout, what is the difference between the $178 b illion and the $88.7 billion?  In effect is it a reserve in case the surplus is larger than we think?  How do we interpret that gap? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The $178 billion is the pr oduct of the sequence of my thinking about how one could cap SOMA temporarily in ou r primary market behavior and in some way communicate that effectively to the market.  Th e question is how to co mmunicate effectively to the market that we were skewing our demand in the secondary market toward the short end.  The $178 billion is just the number that was ve ry crudely calculated off a current snapshot, and too much stock shouldn't be put in it.  It ju st gives a sense that there is a sufficiency of securities in the market if we use this formula that could carry us for a while.  The $88 billion, rounding to $90 billion, represents  the current reserve needs we see over the next seven months.  Now, I'm not sure we are going to  be comfortable buying $90 billion over the next seven months, but we'll see if we can pick up the pace as we go along.   

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  So this really should be  interpreted as a measure of how long you can follow the policies you are describing? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes, how long we could tread water in this way. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  My second question relates to the on-the-run/off-the-run issue.  Is there some reason we haven't done that  before?  It seems like a logical idea.  18

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  We do not purch ase on-the-run issues in th e secondary market.  My point has been that if we let our share of the primary market  expand, we would be collapsing the market for the on-the-run issues in nominal terms.  That's the only point.  We have not been purchasing the on-the-runs.  However, we have been suppressing our demand, if you will, vis-à-vis this schedule for decayed securities that are way, way off-the-run.  You can see on page 14 that we've been trying more or less to work our way up toward 15 percent all along the coupon curve.  In that sense we have b een buying issues decayed way, way off-the-run more aggressively; issues decayed in the 7-year area and the 4-year area ar e way off.  So it is in that sense that I'm maki ng the distinction here.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, I just have a comment.  After our March meeting, I was not sure that even Pe ter would be able to come up with a formula that would satisfy all the instruct ions he received.  I think it is quite extraordinary that he, in fact, has done that.  And I beli eve he should be complimented. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I did!  [Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  I just wanted him to know that his boss also compliments him! 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, both! CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further qu estions for Peter?  If not, would somebody like to move the domestic operations? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  So move. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would somebody like to move the renewal of the reciprocal swap arrangements?  19

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  So move. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.   I want to dissent on that vote. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond dissents.  Let's move on to the economic situati on.  Mike Prell and Vince Reinhart. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL. Vince will begin. MR. REINHART.  The data on fo reign economic activity that have come in since your March meeting have run high relative to our prior expectations.  We have passed th rough much of this surprise to the level of foreign output in our proj ection for the first half of 2000 but have not seen as much reason to alter the pace of its subsequent expansion.  Despite the brighter prospects for the level of activity abroad, the dollar appreciated 3-1/2 percent relati ve to the major currencies over the intermeeting period.  Evidently the up side surprises to  activity in the United States outstripped those abroad, a nd interest rates rose more here.  Even after taking account of this wide ning of the intere st-rate advantage to U.S. obligations, though, we have been hard pressed to explain much of the strength of the dol lar, especially relative to the euro.  True, our economic activity continues to expand mo re rapidly than that in the euro area, and the cacophony of official res ponses to euro weakness raises doubts that necessary structural  reforms will be forthcoming.  Be that as it may, with the str ong external impetus stemming from the weak euro and growing momentum  to domestic spending, the euro area should expand about 3-1/2 percen t this year and next.  Underlying this forecast is the belief that the Eu ropean Central Bank is very likely to tighten in short order and eventually to raise its policy rate a total of     1-1/4 percentage points by the e nd of 2001.  A downside risk to our outlook for spending, however, is that  European officials’ concerns about the value of the euro in the near term will extend beyond the essentially symbolic act of sterilized  intervention, should that happen, to a firming monetary policy sooner an d by more than we have assumed.  Of course, that is a risk that coul d be made more palpable depending on the action you take today.  We are concerned as well that Japanese officials will fail to deliver the policy stance appropriate to en sure sustained economic expansion sufficient to work down the considerab le stockpile of unused resources.  There is little doubt that near-term readings on the pace of spending in Japan will be on the high side, ev en abstracting from problems with  20measurement.  As the news of this  favorable first-half performance comes out, the Bank of Japan is likely to pick short rates off their zero floor, but only by a small amount.   In our view, this near-term strength in the economy is a temporary spurt --not much more than a bounce-back from the sharp contraction in the second half of last year.  Going forward, households will still be burdened by doubts about job security that will make them reluctant consumer s, the lagged effects of the earlier appreciation of the yen will cut into  net exports, and fiscal policy is scheduled to shrink its stimulus.  As a result, Japanese real GDP growth is forecast to settle at below 1 per cent over the last si x quarters of the forecast period.  Because the expansion of activity among our other trading partners seems more assured, when we add it all up our forecast calls for output growth in the foreign economies of 4- 1/2 percent this y ear and 4 percent next year.  Of course, this outlook is shaped importantly by the past and projected path of the exchange rate.  With respect to flows, the exchange rate acts to tilt global spending towa rd those regions where capacity pressures are less binding.  Thus, t oday’s strong dollar helps to direct some U.S. spending toward foreign markets, making our own substantial pressures on resources a bit less inte nse.  Over time, though, that same level of the exchange rate contribut es to a substantial--and deepening--current account deficit and an increa sing reliance on foreign investors’ willingness to hold increasing amounts of claims on the United States.  We have not been able to convi nce ourselves that those foreign investors will continue voluntarily to hold ever-larger stocks of debt at the current level of exchange rates indefinitely.  And so, we’ve written down a path in which the dollar’s valu e falls over the forecast period.  The sense that returns on dollar assets will look less attractive over time to foreign investors also helps to e xplain the rise in longer-term yields on dollar-denominated assets in Mike ’s outlook.  As any forecaster is wont to do, we have projected a path  for the dollar’s decline that is relatively smooth.  In part, that repr esents our equivocation on when that process of adjustment will start.  But when it does, it may not be so orderly or well contained.  Of perh aps most relevance for your policy consideration, the decline in the dollar implies that the foreign sector will no longer be a force helping to absorb robust domestic spending and to restrain domestic inflation.  Rather, less of any excess domestic demand will be satisfied from fore ign capacity, and import prices--and likely tradable prices more generally--will be adding to domestic inflation.  The components of the revision to our outlook have offsetting implications for net exports and th e current account going forward.  The stronger level of foreign activity raises the world’s demand for goods  21and services overall, to the benefit of U.S. exports.  However, because the dollar begins our projected path  of gliding down from a higher altitude, relative prices over the fo recast period work to favor imports and discourage exports more than previ ously.  The net of these forces is incorporated arithmetically in the staff forecast as a shrinking negative contribution of net exports to GDP growth this year and next that is roughly similar to that in the Marc h Greenbook.  We also anticipate the current account deficit to deepen to $ 525 billion by the fourth quarter of 2001.  This deficit represents about 5 percent of nominal GDP and is $20 billion more than in our March forecast.  To the extent that you agree with the staff assessment that the implied accumulation of U.S. obligations abroad will strain fore ign investors’ patience, the likelihood of the dollar depreciation we’ve proj ected--and the risk attendant to that outlook--would seem just a bit more considerable. 

[SECTION]

 MR. PRELL.  As you know, two majo r statistical releases came out this morning: housing starts and the CPI.  We’ve distributed a table summarizing those reports.  Total starts were up about 3 perc ent in April, reflecting a rebound in multifamily units from March’s low level.  That single-family starts were stable, rather than falling off,  runs counter to our expectation, but the significance of that reading is  called into question by a 6 percent continues to be ambiguous, with just  hints that the residential building cycle is about to turn down.    As for the CPI, the overall index was flat and its core component rose 0.2 percent last month.  Food prices increased less than we anticipated, but energy and core pr ices were in line with our expectations--the latter admittedly with a surprising jump in the tobacco category.  The 12-month change in the core backed off to 2.2 percent, after spiking to 2.4 percent last mont h.  That number is the same as a year ago, but still about a quarter  point above the cyclical low.   At this stage of our analysis, I don’t see anything in today’s news that would require us to make a ny fundamental change in our Greenbook forecast.  If I were to summari ze that forecast briefly, given my imminent departure--and with apol ogies to Madame de Pompadour--it could be apres moi le deluge .  Maybe that’s just a tad overly dramatic, but the picture we’ve painted of what lies ahead certainly is less attractive than the landscape of the past few years.  To be sure, our baseline projecti on is that, with only a moderate policy tightening--just a little more than the markets already anticipate--aggregate demand growth will slacken appreciably and overall PCE  22inflation will run only in the low 2 pe rcent area in 2001.  But that result, in our analysis, hinges on a flat stoc k market and a considerable decline in oil prices--two notions to which the markets have proven notably resistant in the few days since the Greenbook went to press.  And, importantly, our baseline projecti on indicates that, as you exit 2001, you’ll find yourselves confronted with still extremely tight labor markets and an uptrend in core inflation.   We, of course, offered a simple solution to the projected inflation problem in one of our alternative scen arios: a bigger rise in short-term interest rates.  The model simulati on suggested that, if our baseline is correct, then a sharper el evation of the funds rate, to 8 percent by year-end, would check the pickup of core inflation.  Indeed, this scenario might be characterized as akin to the “reverse soft landing” that has been mentioned so often.  Another, perhaps less appealing, way to describe it would be a “growth recession.”    The central point is that we think the signs are clearer now that the labor markets have become unsustainab ly tight and that an appreciable rise in the unemployment rate proba bly will be required to hang onto the bulk of the disinflation progress th at you’ve made in recent years.  If our analysis is co rrect, even a further escalation of productivity growth will only postpone the day of reckoning.  As productivity accelerates, you may get a temporary lowering of the effective NAIRU; but once wages begin to catch up w ith the improvement in productivity, the effective NAIRU will move back up and inflation will tend to rise.  To be sure, it’s possible that the l onger-range natural rate has fallen, so that we may not have to see unemployment reach the level we would once have thought necessary, but our guess is that the increase will have to be noticeable.  This is where an unhappy fact comes into the picture:  There isn’t any precedent, at least in our modern economic history, for realizing a substantial rise in our unemployment rate without a recession--not just a growth recessio n, but a meaningful absolute decline in activity.  One may reasonably ask:  Are we re ally destined to repeat history, or might there be reason to hope that this time will be different?  I’m not prepared today to offer you a full exposition of the ways in which the cyclical conjuncture or the struct ure of the economy today might be dissimilar from what it was in past episodes.  I’ll offer a few, brief comments, however.    First, from the viewpoint of the simple macro model, there are no logical grounds for ruling out the possibility of a fairly soft landing.  One can envision a period of relatively slow--but continuously positive-- 23growth during which the pressures on resources ar e gradually relieved, and inflation is contained and then  brought back down.  How far above zero that growth might be on averag e would be a function of how large the current output gap is and how  high potential GDP growth is.  Combine a low NAIRU and a high potent ial growth rate, and there could be room for a distinctly positive expansion pace.  But, backing away from the ether eal, it does seem as if our formal models and even our judgmental anal yses routinely fail to capture the sorts of “nonlinearities” that come in to play once the economy starts to expansions, we generally ende d up skidding into the ditch.   I think that at least part of the pr oblem relates to the fragilities that typically develop during the expansion phase of the business cycle.  The Chairman has, in effect, been addressing one source of such fragility in his admonitions to bankers that they  need to be more cautious.  Loan losses and capital impairment, thei r seeds having been sown in the enthusiasms of the preceding boom, ha ve often created credit crunches that exacerbate the multiplier-accelerator effects damping private investment.  These difficulties can be especially great if banks and other financial institutions have financed a construction boom, because an overhang of supply in real esta te markets--where the assets collateralizing loans are i mmobile and long-lived--i s not easily absorbed.  At this point, I’d judge that the problem s in this sphere aren’t as great as they have been at some times in the past.  And, if there are latent problems, they may lie this time relatively less in the commercial area and relatively more in th e residential, where we haven’t had a cyclical test of the underwriting standards that have made mortgage credit more accessible in the past decade.  I am still less sanguine about another asset market--that for corporate equities.  Share prices cl early are susceptible to exaggerated swings as the balance of greed and fe ar tilts in a bearish direction--with household wealth.  In the current cycle,  there would seem to be a risk of a particularly large decline in the market, given that, by many conventional metrics, we’ve expe rienced a speculative bubble of extraordinary proportions.  The ma rket-correction scenario in the Greenbook--though involving a considerab le, 25 percent decline from the March peak for the Wilshire--m ay well understate the downside potential here.  But, even if you va stly increase the dimension of the if you cushion the effects by backing off on your tightening.    24Is this realistic?  Maybe yes,  maybe no.  I certainly wouldn’t question your nimbleness, but it coul d be challenging to gauge what is required to avoid an undue weakenin g of demand and yet avoid igniting another bull run.  I personally am concerned, moreover, that consumer sentiment could prove volatile.  This hasn’t been much in evidence in the past couple of months, perhaps because the NASDAQ slide reversed gains that were enjoyed only briefl y--and perhaps mainly by investors who were riding what they must have  recognized was a wild wave.  But I suspect that in recent years many households have been lulled into complacency about the adequacy of their savings by the run-up in share prices and that a major shrinkage of their nest eggs would severely dent their spirits.  On the other hand, thou gh, it isn’t clear that we have seen outsized wealth effects on the up side as consumers’ spirits have soared, so perhaps we need not be greatly concerned about the consequences on the down side.   I’d be remiss if I did not mention one other likely r eason that soft landings have proven elusive.  That is that, in part because of the lags in the effects of interest rate increas es and our foggy crystal balls, we probably have had a tendency to tigh ten too much or too long.  This undoubtedly would be an argument of those who would caution against more aggressive tightening action ri ght now, with the effects of your first five policy actions still in the pipeline.  However, I would raise the question whether that pipeline has no t sprung a leak, draining off some of the restraint; I refer, of course, to  the considerable further increase in share prices, on net, since you began your sequence.    This, to be sure, is not a comp rehensive assessment of the risks that lie ahead.  Vince noted the pote ntial ramifications of our external imbalance.  The interactions of a ll these forces could be complex and certainly are impossible to foresee.  However, I don’t think this adds up to a prescription of hesitation in the move toward greater monetary restraint.  Indeed, one might argue th at the pattern of too much, too long that I noted a moment ago has been  a byproduct of doing too little early enough.  The bottom line judgment I would offer is that, if anything, the news of the intermeeting period has hi ghlighted the basic imbalances in the economy that probably will become more serious and more difficult to deal with if aggregate demand is not reined in at least moderately.  And I don’t think you can depend on the markets to do the work without your participation.  That concludes our remarks, Mr. Chairman.   

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Ques tions for Mike or Vince?  25

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mike, I'm struck by your la st comment that we've perhaps tended to do too much late in the game because we did too little in the early stages.  But does doing too little in the early st ages justify in anyone's mind doing too much later? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  It certainly wouldn't justif y it, but one would hope that by getting ahead of the curve, to use the parlance--  

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  But if we are behind the curve, do we want to overreact in an attempt to correct that? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Presumably you never want to overreact.   MR. HOENIG.  Right.  I like that answer.   MR. PRELL.  But as one perhaps gets frus trated in not seeing the desired response and as the problem seems to be getting worse be cause inflation lags the changes in the output gap, there is probably always going to be a risk of overstaying on the tight side. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Mike, I have a question about  the simulations.  If you carried these out to 2002 or 2003 and beyond--maybe you did or maybe you didn't--what would you get for inflation?  I'm particularly interested in the ba seline case and its flat funds rate scenario after this year. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We get inflation continuing on up.  This is all finely calibrated through our judgmental forecast and then what the model produces, which is this upward trend in inflation.  Part of the problem in that s cenario is that the funds rate is stable at 7-1/4 percent and thus it begins to de cline in real terms.  In esse nce you begin to ha ve less and less restraint and you're accommodating an acceleration of inflation.  It so happens that running the exercise with our model and holding the funds rate steady at 8 percen t avoids that problem  26and you have a stable inflation path.  In fact , a couple of years down the road you probably will find that the unemployment rate is drifti ng up above the steady state of the NAIRU and you will need to begin to ease policy in order to avoid overshooting on the disinflation.  But how far you want to go down this road depends  in part on where you want to end up.  If you want to end up at 2 percent core PCE inflation, then this 8 percen t scenario might fit the bill.  If you want to get inflation down closer to what we think is true price stability, that tighter scenario and related output gap may need to be there for a while. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  What I am trying to get a ha ndle on is how much more inflation we ought to anticipate in another year or two in the baseline case and the flat funds rate.  I certainly believe you that the tighter policy may produce the kind of reaction you're talking about.  But in those other two scenarios-- 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well, I'll confess that we did not  extend the flat funds rate scenario to the out years, but I certainly anticipate that it would be a much worse looking picture.  The extension of the 7-1/4 percent funds rate in our model extrapolation- -and this involves some extrapolation of the baseline forecast to be gin with--results in infl ation by 2002 moving into the 3 percent area on core PCE. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Three percent?  Okay. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  I have a question about the international accounts, the foreign dollar claims.  How do we get a sense of the magnit udes here?  I understa nd the uneasiness about this.  But what fraction of Dutch assets, for ex ample, are now claims on the United States?  Or how do these fractions compare with some of th ese models of optimal international portfolio diversification?  I know they may give  you some guidance of how far off we--  27

[SECTION]

 MR. REINHART.  The models of optimal international portfolio diversification would suggest that there is a long way to run beca use they conclude that there is a significant home bias.  That is, households in a domestic country hold far too much of their wealth in their own currency and not enough in ternational assets.  So, from that perspective, both they and we should be accumulating more intern ational assets rela tively.  As a rough approximation the answer you get is that the as sets a country’s reside nts should hold ought to be something on the order of their share of world GDP.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Shouldn't that  depend on expectations regarding exchange rates?  With a fixed exchange rate st ructure, then holdings of international assets gravitate toward the distribution of a country’s foreign trade.  But if there are currency risks, foreign asset holdings would tend to fall quite short of such a distribution. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Sure.  I wa s talking about an environment in which there was an equality of risk-adjusted retu rns worldwide.  In that cas e the international portfolio diversification of househol ds would move toward--  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Foreign currency assets? MR. REINHART.  Right.  It would move towa rd those shares.  But the fact is that households hold fewer foreign assets than our m odels think they should.  However, countering that is a long historical propert y that they don't hold those assets , and we are testing the ranges of reserve shares.   Now to answer the factual part of your quest ion, we don't have international flow of funds accounts that would give us information a bout the levels of foreign assets and their distributions across countries.  We can get it fr om the perspective of the United States; in fact  28there is a new survey coming out on that.  Bu t I can't answer your question for the Belgian dentist or the Dutch broker. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mike, I was also interested in your comment about “too little, too late” or “too much, too long” from a couple of different perspectives.  Your 8 percent f unds rate scenario as compared with the baseline case of 7-1/4 percent would seem to provide a range of optio ns.  The 7-1/4 percent would give us some protection against the downward phase of the cy cle you talked about, where we are unable to factor in what will really happen because of the nonlinearities that are involved when the economy is slowing down.  I’m just asking wh ether I'm interpreting your comments correctly in terms of the differences between your baseline  case and the 8 percent funds rate scenario.  With the 8 percent alternativ e your model doesn't produce a re cession, but then again we don't know how to judge some of the risks associated with the nonlinea rities that arise.  So am I right in assuming that at least w ith regard to the next couple of  years, you'd say that there is some kind of cushion between the baseline and th e tighter funds policy alternative that would absorb some of the risk of the nonlinearities? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  First, I would caution agai nst taking any of these numbers as seriously as we seem to be doing here. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes. MR. PRELL.  That’s a caveat I would i ssue about these long-run simulations, let alone the shorter-run forecast.  I guess I'd say that  as we assess the trends in aggregate demand and take as given certain features of the exte rnal environment, we don't see 7-1/4 percent as doing the job of capping inflation.  Now, if you were trying to figure out  what strategy to  29adopt if you had to make a decision today on wher e to move the funds rate by the end of the year, I'd certainly characterize the 7-1/4 percen t as a more cautious approach.  That strategy lowers the risk of so sharp a deceleration in the economy that you begin to set off the momentum of these nonlinearities.  But this conc lusion is very speculative, and shocks could come along that would significantly alter the pictur e.  It is a gentler policy.  Whether it's kinder in the long run [Laughter] depends on how th ings evolve.  If it merely delays what you feel is going to be needed to catch up, thus producing a more violent response, it would not be kinder in the end. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Coming at it another way, though, suppose we start in the next month or so to move the funds rate up as we  approach that total increase of 125 basis points by the end of the year.  At this point you don't consider that a descri ption of too much, too long? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  No, definitely not.  That is our  thesis.  As for whether it is correct or not, I can't provide any guarantees.    

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  But if you were going to assess the risks-- MR. PRELL.  It is an installment, but  we think you are going to need more installments down the road to really hold the line on inflation.  Inflation will be tending to drift up as you move through the forecast horizon. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  What is the risk th at it is too l ittle, too late? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well, my concern--particularly  in light of the developments in the last few days--is that the markets are entirely  too comfortable with the policy of gradual increases in the funds rate.  We  may find that the stock market  continues to trend upward and we do not get the negative wealth effect that we have in our forecast, but rather a neutral or  30positive wealth effect.  That would create an aggregate demand picture that was much less compatible with holding the line on inflation.  So I would identify that risk.  Vince identified the risk that at some point the dollar could have  a more precipitous dec line, and obviously that would exacerbate the pressures on domestic resources.  I don't want to paint the picture as completely asymmetric because, as I also suggested, the market might be vulnerable to a significant reversal if the basic, positive psyc hology is shaken by some event.  Who knows?  In that case the dollar still might  look like the place to be.  So , there are risks on both sides. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan. MR. JORDAN.  Thank you.  First of all, Mike , let me say that it really does look different from this end of the tabl e where you used to sit!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Clearer! MR. JORDAN.  But if I sound a bit disorien ted and confused, remember that I've only been sitting here a little over an hour, wher eas you had a lot of years to absorb the vision from here!  When I look at the data in the Greenbook fo r the last four quarters, including the current quarter and assuming that the Greenbook fo recast is correct on that quarter, I have to say that the resultant set of numbers is really ex traordinary.  It’s not only a set of numbers that was not forecast, but one that I would consider un forecastable.  One of the exercises that I like to go through to prepare for an FOMC meeting is  to review how things looked a year ago to me, to the Blue Chip forecasters, and to a lot of  other folks.  And I reflect on what kinds of policy assumptions went into those forecasts.  Sometimes I review more than a year, but certainly I try to recall how the economy looked a year earlier.  In view of these numbers on real GDP for the four-quarter period through the current quarter, I was looking at some tables  31the staff prepares and how they compared to th ose done last May.  My first thought was:  My gosh!  The staff got it exactly ri ght.  And then I realized I was looking at a table on nominal GDP for that four-quart er period!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We were expecting 5 percent nominal. MR. JORDAN.  Then I picture myself in  the fourth quarter of 2001, say at the of nominal GDP, real GDP, and all of the othe r variables in these Greenbook tables for the six-quarter period starting in th e third quarter of 2000 and runni ng through the fourth quarter of next year.  But then if I l ooked at where the funds rate woul d be--at 7-1/4 or 8 percent or something like that--and the associated other yiel ds, I think I would be absolutely mystified.  Now, I have to admit that, when I reflect on the financial markets of the last four quarters, I have a lot of unanswered ques tions about their consistency with the performance of the economy.  Certainly the Treasury ma rket is difficult to interpret.   Let’s say that the markets have it right, and what is refl ected in the financial markets is that we have a transitory acceleration in nominal spending and real output a nd then we will glide into the staff’s set of numbers in the Greenbook.  In that scenario, I cannot imagine getting in to the fourth quarter of 2001 and seeing the funds rate up there in the 7 percent range or more and the associated other interest rates comparably higher.  In fact, I would say where rates are right now is probably consistent with this  set of nominal and real GDP numbers.  Your reaction? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  We’ve made a few mistakes in the past!  [Laughter]  So we could be making a mistake this time.  We could be maki ng a mistake this time even if we had been perfect in the past.  But in esse nce our judgment is that the rise in interest rates has to some extent reflected the pressures of an extraordin ary expansion in aggreg ate demand that is in  32part a product of the run-up in stock prices.  And, in  all likelihood, it’s also  partly a reflection of an adjustment to a higher potential growth  rate that has come with an acceleration of productivity.  As we look at what has been an  accelerating pattern of  economic expansion, it seems to us that we probably have not moved interest rates up enough to curb that acceleration of aggregate demand and real growth.  So, we believe that we need to move rates up still further for a period in order to rein in  this expansion somewhat and restore a balance between aggregate supply and demand.  Whether ra tes will have to go as high as we forecast and remain that high is difficult to say.  Fis cal policy developments could play a role in determining that.  But this forecast is our best shot.  And it's not one that is grossly at odds with what the market seems to be anticipating, with one exception.  And that is that we are looking for a significant further rise in nominal bond yields because we don't think the market really has built in this upward trend in inflati on that we believe is commencing.  So as we look forward, we expect there will be a need for a hi gh real interest rate, and we anticipate that inflation expectations are going to  be deteriorating somewhat in  the environment that we are forecasting.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry. MR. PARRY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Vince, beginning in 1999 and continuing through 2001 the foreign real GDP growth  rates are quite stro ng, especially in the industrial countries.  Would you ch aracterize this primarily as a cyclical development or is there an indication that perhaps some of th e “new economy” developments, which certainly have affected us over the last four or five years and have produced forecasts that were consistently too low, are at work as well?  33

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I think a significant fr action of the higher growth for 1999 and 2000 is cyclical because by our es timate there are output gaps to  be worked down in many of the industrial countries.  And the fact that foreign growth  in 2001 moderates in our forecast really suggests that we couldn't find the new eco nomy effects working as successfully abroad as has been the case in the United States.  Ri ght now there are some tentative pieces in the puzzle that suggest that producti vity growth has probably picked  up in Canada.  And we have raised our estimate of potential out put growth for that country.  Rising productivity is also the case in some of the smaller European countri es, particularly those that use information technology rather heavily.  However, those are th e smaller countries and their contribution to total foreign output is relatively modest.  It won't be until we see something in the major industrial countries that we are going to see fo reign economic growth above  the top line of our forecast.  And it's in the major industrial coun tries where the structural problems seem most severe.  Whether those problems will actually be a drag on activity, say, in Japan, or just impede the progress necessary toward taking full  advantage of the new economy, is hard to say. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Let me just add a footnote.  You made the point that we see foreign growth slowing; that happened as well in ou r own forecasts for the U.S. economy.  So it may be that you would not find signs of the new econo my in the macro forecast.  But looking at different sectors in the economy could result in a forecast that is more nontraditional in nature.  I don't disagree with you, incidentally, about the limited importance of the new economy element, certainly in Europe.  But it is someth ing that could become a factor at some point. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  And one reason we've been  looking for it harder in the last couple of months is that, in fact, equity prices have risen so much in many parts of Europe.   34And the better performance of IT-sector equities  relative to the major indexes also has some precedent in the U.S. data. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In a country like  Finland, which is presumed to have a major rise in and a disproportiona te share of high-tech usage, do we see it in their output per hour figures? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  That was one of the sma ll countries in Europe that I had in mind.  There is an OECD study that looks at a fe w of the peripheral countries and argues that the trend in output per hour has picked up in them.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What w ould be the order of magnitude? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Right now it is relativel y modest.  I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I think it is on th e order of 1/2 percentage point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mike, I wanted to ask you about the wealth effect assumptions in the Greenbook.  I am particularly intere sted in what you are assuming about the carryover effect of the increa ses in the stock market that we saw in 1999 and in previous years.  You are assuming a flat  stock market in the ba seline and you indicated that there would be a small nega tive in terms of the w ealth effect in the second half of this year and a negative of about 1/2 point in 2001.  I'm just wondering how you are factoring in the impact of the increase in the stock ma rket in earlier years in these assumptions. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Well, that is all folded in there.  That is a reflection of the distributed lag of those effects.  35

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  How powerful are the increas es in previous y ears on this year's consumption? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Were it not for those lagged effects we'd ha ve a negative effect this year on balance.  But we still have a good part of the effect of the 1999 rise in particular impacting the economy this year. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.   Why are th ey turning negative then? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  The stable stock market means that the ratio of wealth to income is falling.  And that's the indicator on which one w ould base an anticipated  drag on consumption. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  What’s involved is the distinction between the level and the growth of consumption.  There will no longe r be an impetus from wealth adding to or boosting consumption growth, altho ugh the earlier wealth effect will still be supporting the level of consumption.  So just from the fact that  the stock market levels out, we no longer get that kick in consumption. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I understand that, but I w ould have thought the impact of the previous years would have had a larger impact  this year because I know the effects don’t occur just within that one year. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  In the first half of this year we are getting a substantial effect.  But at this point it is decaying and in the second half  of this year it will have disappeared.  We expect to get a very large propor tion of the effect within the first year and a half, and it diminishes after that. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  What was the effect in the first half of this year? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  Roughly a percentage point.  36

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  We got over a percentage point in the first quarter and then, in our forecast, it slips down considerably in the second quarter.  So, we have a little over 1/2 percentage point effect on the PCE growth in the first half, which trai ls off to about roughly down 0.1 or 0.2 percentage point in the second half .  Part of the reason, too, is that the stock Wilshire 5000 has not been rising as rapidly as  the NASDAQ obviously was earlier.  So with that lag distribution, we are starting to see the positive wealth effect really peter out, even though we do have considerable lags in that model that are important. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. MR. MCTEER.  On page 9 in Part I of the Greenbook is a paragraph labeled “Prospects for the supply side of the economy and inflation.”  It’s nice to  see the supply side covered there.  The first sentence says:  “T he expansion of aggregate supply has been substantial, but nowhere near enough to match the advance of demand.”  I'm not sure what that means.  Presumably when you look at  the economy you are so rt of observing the intersection of supply and demand and both are advancing.  Does your  sentence just mean that as they have advanced inflation has gone up a li ttle?  Is that the evid ence on which you base that statement? 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  No, basically it's pointing to levels of resource u tilization.  Whether we look at the unemployment rate or industrial ca pacity utilization, in bo th cases the level of utilization has been rising.  So, by definition in  essence, the growth of  aggregate supply has been less than the grow th of aggregate demand.  37

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  It looks to me as if you've  said that the growth was the same but we are just running out of potential for furthe r growth in supply or something like that. 

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL  I guess I'm more comfortabl e putting it the way I did.  And as you noted, one could also point to evidence on the wage and price si de that is confirming this increasing pressure. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Does anybody el se have a question or comment?  Would somebody like to start the di scussion?  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, the information we have this month from our District is not very diffe rent from what it has been for the last several meetings.  We've seen a few signs of a possible moderation in cons umer spending.  The pace of car sales has We've also had a few reports of less robust housing construction and sales most recently, especially in the Carolinas.  And we’ve hear d some anecdotal reports that higher mortgage rates are finally beginning to bite .  But as Mike said, the evidence is still pretty ambiguous.  Such comments are not heard that frequently and our sense is that residential activity is still remarkably strong across our region as a whol e.  Indeed, broadly sp eaking, our District economy across all sectors is clearly very strong.   We had some signs a couple of months ago that manufacturing activity might be decelerating a bit, but our most recent survey suggests that factory activity has revived.  We've even had a few positive comments from the textile industry, something we haven't heard for a long time.  Just to cite  a little additional information, the Washington metropolitan area can only be described as booming, and that includes the District of Columbia as well as the outlying suburbs.  Both commercial and residential real estate are very strong here.  And finally, labor markets remain exceptionally  38tight throughout our District.  That is obviously an old story, but in my experience it's increasingly becoming a preoccupa tion with our business contacts, directors, and others.  And we do hear more reports of wage increases.   Now, when I look at the national economy, the question I ask myself is this:  Is there anything in the recent information on th e economy that suggests we ought to back off from our current strategy of incrementally incr easing the real federal f unds rate until we get some sense that the growth of aggregate dema nd is coming back into line with reasonable estimates of the sustainable growth in supply?  I just don't see any such information at this point.  On the contrary, the most recent data on prices and on wages in particular seem to me to underscore the need for continued increases in  real interest rates to bring the aggregate economy back into better balance.  We got a new CPI number this morning.  Mike, you mentioned the 12-month change in the core CP I was 2.2 percent.  I had called Richmond and my staff said the number was 2.3 percent for th e 12-month period ending in April.  It may have been 2-1/4 percent and the difference is in the rounding.  In any event, it is approaching a rate that is 1/2 point hi gher than it was just a few months a go.  So it seems to me that there is at least some evidence that we are at last e xperiencing some increase in actual inflation.  And the staff's projection that the upw ard trend is going to persist strikes me as both reasonable and disturbing. Wage pressures also appear to be picking up; that shouldn't be su rprising with labor revised upward its projection for that measure,  which again seems reasonable to me.  The Greenbook observed that the various compensation measures we use may not be capturing the full impact of nontraditional actions that business firms are now taking--signing bonuses,  39retention bonuses, and the like--to attract and re tain workers.  We don’ t really know how these new actions may be affecting both the growth of overall labor costs and pricing behavior by firms.  I would just add that that observation is very consistent with many of the comments we've heard from our director s and other business contacts. What bothers me most, though, is the evidence --or at least what I see as evidence--of higher inflation expectations.  We see it to  some extent in the household survey data.  Long-term interest rates are now rising.  To me a reasonable guess is that at least some of that reflects an increase in inflation expectations.   The spread between the yield on regular10-year Treasury bonds and 10-year TIPS has increased significantly since our last meeting.  I know one can't read inflation expectation changes point -for-point from changes in that spread, but I think the kind of increase we've had recently is probably signaling that expectations of future inflation have risen at least to some extent a nd maybe materially.  I recognize that temporary factors can explain some of these developments.  But it also seems perfectly plausible to me that they are being driven to a large exte nt by our persistent aggregate demand/supply imbalance in the context of ever- tighter resource constraints, and that real interest rates need to continue to rise to cont ain inflation going forward.  Th at strikes me as the most straightforward interpretation of the most recent information we've seen.  And for me at least, the main policy imperative facing us now is to be  sure that real intere st rates continue to increase.  I would add that this feeling on my  part is hardly diminished by Mike Prell's comments at the end of his statement, which I th ought were very powerful.  Relevant to your comments, Tom, it seems to me th at what we need to do is to avoid getting ourselves into a position where we have to react strongly and thus open ourselves up to the charge of overreacting.  40

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  Growth in New England remains remarkably strong.  Employment continue s to grow at a rapid rate, just below the pace of the nation.  And unemploym ent rates for the region as a w hole, as well as for three of the District’s states, are at all-time lows.  Reflecting this and in some ways echoing Al Broaddus’s comments, it is just not possible to have a conversati on about local economic conditions anywhere in the Distri ct without discussing the near impossibility of finding labor.  Whether the need is for high-tech personnel or d ecidedly low-tech blue-co llar entry level staff, these positions are harder to fill and they are more expensive than previously.  Local firms, large and small, continue to be inventive about making capital investments that replace labor and about using a wide variety of techniques intended to moderate th e cost of hiring and retaining staff.  These include  the use of temporary help a nd outsourcing, even to foreign suppliers.  But increasingly th ese techniques are not enough.  A nd our contacts report that holding the line on wages--and on benefit cost s particularly--is really becoming a losing battle.  Adding to this is th e fact that non-personnel costs are also rising, especially if production inputs are oil-based.  Manufacturers using or produci ng plastic seem particularly hard hit.  So, while widespread price increases still are not the norm, such increases seem to be much more feasible and closer to happening than in prior months. Looking to the national scene, incoming da ta since our last meeting once again suggest that for most, if not all, of this peri od growth has been not onl y stronger than expected but has been accelerating.  Moreover, the expect ed pickup in inflation seems to have begun in earnest whether one looks at actual price da ta for goods and services, at wage costs and especially benefit costs, or at expectations.  I think it's important, however, to take a measured  41response to this uptick in prices.  After all,  the Greenbook as well as our own forecasts have been suggesting for some time now that the rate  of price increase woul d accelerate.  That's why we favored a tighter monetary policy.  Mo reover, we may be seeing the beginning of a slowdown, as evidenced by the volatile and downwar d trend of the stock market, rising capital and debt costs, and the housing and retail sales data.   Our forecast, however, like the Greenbook, suggests that in the absence of sizable further tightening, this slowdown--if in fact it is  real and not the “head fake” that is mentioned in the Greenbook--will not be enough to forestal l deepening price problems.  We may or may not be “behind the curve,” as some would say.  But I do think it is necessary now to be very focused on a measured forward direction of policy. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Seventh District economy continues to perform quite well, but the tone  of reports from our contacts has changed recently, as several noted some slowing in ac tivity.  A growing number of firms indicated increasing cost pressures and some new reports  emerged related to tight labor markets. In terms of real activity, our housing sect or still seems to be doing well but we are starting to hear more stories of  slowing.  Reports on light vehicl e sales in the District have been mixed, with some of our directors repor ting continued strength, particularly in luxury models, but dealers in several me tro areas reporting weak sales a nd reduced showroom traffic.  Two of the Big Three auto makers told us late last week that they were sensing some slowing in light vehicle sales on a nationa l basis, although expected sales levels are still quite high.  A large national retailer headquartered in our Di strict told me his company had seen no signs that sales were slowing nationally this month.  Ho wever, some retailers told us that their sales  42in the Midwest last month were not as strong as elsewhere in the nation, perhaps due to the weather. Purchasing managers’ survey results from  Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee all show continued expansion in April, but at a s lightly slower pace than in March.  The prices paid components from the regional PMI reports  were down only slightly from five-year highs reached in March, suggesting that District firms are facing increased cost pressures.  Indeed, several large manufacturing firms who have a history of conti nuous cost reductions told us recently that it is becoming more and more diffi cult to get cost reductions from suppliers and that they face increasing pri ce pressures on a wide variety of inputs.  And our survey of Michigan retailers suggests that  prices to consumers are al so moving up, as the number of respondents raising their prices  grew sharply in March.   Our labor markets are still tighter than the nation’s.  Moreover, there does not seem to be any let-up in demand for workers.  Manpowe r's latest survey of hiring intentions set a new record:  More firms than ever before in th e survey's 24-year history indicated that they plan to increase employment in the third quarter , with strength across a ll regions of the nation as well as across all industries.  That inform ation is not going to be released publicly until The employment cost index for the Midwes t has recently been rising faster than that for the nation as a whole.  That is consistent with the findi ngs of some research our staff has done, which confirms that relative unemploymen t rates continue to be useful predictors of regional differences in wage growth.  In so me cases tight labor markets are holding back business expansion.  For example, one auto supp lier recently closed a Michigan plant because there weren't enough workers available to staff it.  And 70 percent of the respondents to our  43latest survey of Michigan re tailers said customer service was suffering because of worker shortages. On the whole, most firms have been more successful in expanding employment than the very low unemployment rates would su ggest.  Increasingly we have been hearing anecdotal reports that unmeasured immigration may be playing a signif icant role in this employment growth, as you have  suggested in recent meetings , Mr. Chairman.  Of course, immigrants have long had a significant presence in large cities like Chicago, but official statistics suggest that the immigrant share of th e labor force in other pa rts of the District is neither high nor increasing.  However, I recentl y visited Columbus, Indiana, a manufacturing center of about 35,000 people where Cummin s Engines is located and where the unemployment rate is 1.9 percen t.  I heard extensive reports that the town has seen a tremendous increase in immigrants from Latin Amer ica in the last few years.  It was estimated that 1,000 to 2,000 immigrants were now working in area firms.  The story is similar in other small-to-medium size towns in our District.  Inci dentally,                                         told me that he had contacted the INS because of concer ns that many immigrants were undocumented.  The INS responded that they lacked the resour ces to investigate th ese cases unless they involved troublemakers.  Of cour se, the city’s employers need the immigrants to staff their plants and other facilities. Turning to the national outlook, recent data have led us to increase our projections for growth and for inflation in 2000.  Gains in employment and hours continue to be impressive and the consumption sector remained  red-hot through the firs t quarter.  Our real GDP growth path is slightly stronger than that in the Greenbook.  Although consumers will eventually slow their spending p ace, we are expecting less slowi ng in the second half of this  44year than the Greenbook.  The in flation data are beginning to s how signs of deterioration, and our outlook for PCE inflation is  roughly similar to that in  the Greenbook over the next 18 months.   So, the key question at this juncture is wh ether the policy actions we have taken to date are sufficient to put the economy on a sustai nable track.  Consumer expectations continue to be quite elevated and the wealth effect from  prior years' equity gains has probably not run its course.  We have been waiting for a slow down in aggregate demand for some time.  Although this hope has not been realized, the increas ed inflationary consequences to date have been minimal.  But I am not as optimistic this time around.  In my view the balance of risks is clearly weighted toward  higher inflation.    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry. MR. PARRY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Twelfth District economy has continued its robust expansion so far this ye ar.  California's economy remains on a strong growth path, spurred by unusually rapid gains in  income and consumer spending.  During the first four months of this year, employment in creased at a 3-1/2 percent pace, well above last year's pace.  Personal income gains were siza ble last year.  And data on state government revenues suggest that income growth picked up further in the first quarter of this year.  Moreover, growth in consumer spending appears to be even more rapid than income growth in the state.  Last year's growth rate in taxa ble sales was the largest since 1984.  Demand for housing and commercial real estate remains very st rong in California as well.  For example, in the San Francisco Bay area, high-tech equity we alth has helped to push up median prices on existing homes by 25 percent during the past year.   Real estate markets in the remainder of the District also have shown little or no signs of cooling.  45In the District manufacturing sector moderate job losses have continued this year, but output and sales have been rising in response to improvements in export demand.  Although Boeing's employment fell further in th e first quarter, the pace of job losses has slowed.  And rising East Asian demand is evid ent in accelerated delivery schedules on some previously delayed orders.  Moreover, semi conductor manufacturers have benefited from substantial improvement in worldwide demand.  As one example, Intel and another maker of semiconductors plan investments totaling $3 b illion in additional ma nufacturing capacity in Arizona.  Probably the strongest source of grow th in the District recently has been the software and Internet services sector.  The pace of investment in that sector likely will be reduced by the recent sharp decline in high-tech equity valuations.  However, for promising investments the pool of available ve nture capital remains very large. Turning to the national economy, recent data certainly have raised a red flag about inflation.  First, although real GDP slowed in the first quarter, real spending--as measured by real final sales--actually picked  up from the very strong fourth-qua rter results.  Retail sales did flatten out in April, but it's obviously too soon to conclude that cons umers have downshifted their spending.  Second, the further tightening of  labor markets in April is not a good sign for inflation.  And third and most importantly, the news on inflation itself has been worrisome.  With inflation coming in on the high side in th e first quarter, we now have had two straight quarters with inflation rates that  were above the previously esta blished level.  The core PCE price index rose by an average of 1.9 percent in the past two quarters vers us l.3 percent over the four quarters before that.  While part of  this acceleration could be caused by a one-time passthrough of higher energy costs to core prices, it is also quite possible that we are beginning to see a sustained upward trend.    46With regard to our own forecast, we've a ssumed that the funds rate will reach 6-3/4 percent by the fourth quarter of this year and that the broad stock market will remain unchanged at recent levels.  Under these assump tions we expect to see a gradual slowing in activity, with real GDP growth averaging 4.6 percen t in the final three qu arters of this year and 3.9 percent in 2001.  But labor and product ma rkets are expected to remain tight through the end of next year and core inflation to show a gradual upward trend, despite an assumed rapid growth rate in productivity.  The core PCE price index is proj ected to average 2.1 percent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2001.  Our inflation forecast is up only slightly from where it had been for some time.  The really important new development is that we've seen a pickup in actual inflation in the past two quarters that might be the beginning of a new trend.  In any event, it is now clear th at the previously established downward trend has ended at a level above price stability.  Over all, developments since our last  meeting have certainly raised my concerns about inflation significantly.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall economic conditions in our Southeast region are little change d since March.  Growth continue s to be moderately strong.  We can still find only scant eviden ce in either the regional data  or anecdotal reports of any significant slowing as a result of  our earlier tightening moves.  Consistent with the national data, residential construction in our area is now showing some si gns that rising interest rates are beginning to bite.  But even in that sector  there are pockets of continuing strength.  In contrast, nonresidential constr uction might actually be picking up somewhat.  We see no signs yet of obvious overbuilding.  In Atlanta 5 million square feet of new space were absorbed in 1999 and reportedly another 2 million square feet have already been absorbed in 2000.   47Tourism is quite strong, with good advance booki ngs.  Exports from our region are up from the early months of the year, led by a pic kup in demand from Canada and Mexico.  And exports to Brazil from Florida, th at state's top export market, we re up 7 percent from last year, as Brazil emerges from its slump.   Labor markets continue to tell the most co mpelling story of resource constraints.  They now have to be characterized as ex tremely tight.  Regional employment expanded another 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2000, ma tching the pace of the fourth quarter of last year.  And a recent survey that I saw listed Atla nta as the fastest growing large metropolitan area in the nation.  Those ever-tighter labor mark ets are fueling an endless string of  “have you heard" anecdotal stories about how employers are coping or tr ying to cope.  Some of the quirkiest include a raffle for a new car for t hose employees working extraordinary amounts of overtime, concierge services, including laundry drop-offs and pickups, and even pet sitting--a new one that someone mentioned to me last wee k.  At our directors meeting last Friday, one director reported that his                                  had been offered and had accepted a $250,000 signing bonus to re-up for an addi tional 10 years.  Even the govern ment is getting into the act! Underscoring a point that Al Br oaddus made, I too am hearing more people suggest that these nontraditional forms of compensation and concessions are not being picked up in the traditional compensation measures.        At the national level, we see the Greenbook as having done a partic ularly good job this time in capturing the current situ ation.  The pace of economic activity remains quite strong on almost all fronts and inflationary pressures are now more obvious.  Consumer spending not only continues to be strong but, given high levels  of confidence, consumers appear poised to continue to spend at a good pace.  Investment  spending bounced back markedly in the first  48quarter; and though it will surely settle back to some less drama tic rate of growth, the signs point to considerable strength.  The generally  positive picture among our trading partners suggests growing demand from the foreign sect or.  And the apparently even stronger-than-thought federal tax revenues would seem to enc ourage higher federal sp ending.  So, it is hard for me to see where moderation in demand might come from. I think the inflation outlook has clearly dete riorated.  For some time now we have observed a number of developments that ap pear to be creating conditions in which inflationary pressures could likel y begin to build, and we wisely have been at least modestly preemptive in trying to stay ahead of those de velopments.  Now I think most of us, including me, would say that we are seeing an upward dr ift in measured inflation, whatever one’s preferred index.  And almost all fore casts, including the Greenbook, our own Bank simulations, and those of most private forecaste rs, envision a further upward drift over coming quarters. Perhaps the most troubling of all to me is  the apparent deterioration in inflation expectations.  We have worked too hard and othe rs in the economy have paid too high a price in the past to let our collective commitment a nd credibility be eroded.  While there are some risks in both directions, I believe  the time has come to be a bit more aggressive in our policy response.  I think the economy has enough stre ngth and enough momentum to absorb such a nudge without great risks.  In a vein similar to Jerry Jordan’s question to  Mike Prell earlier, our most recent modeling work suggests that if we remain appropriately preemptive, we may not have to raise rates quite as high as otherw ise nor hold them at re latively high levels for quite so long.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. STONE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Third District's economy is continuing to grow, with accelerating employ ment growth and a declining unemployment rate, which just brings us to about the nationa l average.  Recently we completed a series of meetings with bankers and businesspeople thro ughout our District, a nd the message is the same.  They are all complaining about th e difficulty of finding qualified workers.  Manufacturing activity has continued to expa nd, based on our May business outlook survey, which will not be publicly released until this Thursday.  Although new orders and shipments were not as strong as in the previous month, th e levels reported in May remain solidly positive and are not much different than earlier in the year. Retailers in our District re ported moderate year-over-year gains in sales in March and sales, which they attribute to manufacturers ’ incentives and higher consumer incomes.  Residential housing activity ha s continued at quite a brisk pace overall even though some builders are reporting a modest sl owdown from the pace earlier this year.  Bankers, however, are expecting a slowdown in housing activity du ring the next six months.  Nonresidential construction is not as strong as it was a y ear ago, although it pick ed up somewhat in Pennsylvania and Delaware in the first part of this year.  Central Pennsylvania, for instance, has had a significant increase in construction of materials handling and di stribution facilities.  Real estate contacts are still qui te optimistic that nonresidential construction will remain fairly strong. Turning to wages and prices in the Di strict, many businesses report paying higher wages because of the tight labor markets.  Th e frequency of such reports has been rising over time.  Businesses also report pa ying higher import prices.  Reta ilers are talking more about  50cost pressures and a desire to raise prices than  they were last year.  And our business outlook survey this month is again reco rding a very high index of prices  paid by manufacturers.  That survey’s index of prices rece ived by manufacturers, however, is noticeably lower this month than it was in April, suggesting that our re gion’s manufacturers ar e still having difficulty charging higher prices to their customers. In general, recent business sentiment is not as optimistic about the outlook as it was a few months ago.  Even though we continue to  hear impressive anecdotal stories about farmers and businesses coming up with innovativ e ideas to improve productivity, business people now sound more cautious.  They don't expect as much economic growth six months from now and they are also expressing  more concern about rising inflation. Turning to the national scene, aggregate de mand is still growing faster than supply despite impressive year-to-year gains in produc tivity.  Consumer spending in particular has shown little sign of slowing to a more sustaina ble pace.  Although our staff’s outlook is not as pessimistic as the Greenbook in terms of its infl ation projections, we agree that it is unlikely that demand will slow sufficiently to forestall further increases in inflationary pressures without additional Committee action. Now, how much the Committee will ultimately need to move will depend on whether or not we feel we are behind the curve.  In that regard, I take some comfort from the fact that so far there has been little upward  movement in survey measures of long-term expected inflation.  Although expectations of infl ation over the next year  have generally risen in recent months, expectations of longer-run in flation have not.  For instance, our Reserve Bank’s most recent survey of professional for ecasters, which will be publicly released next Monday, shows that the median of expected cons umer price inflation over the next ten years  51remained at 2-1/2 percent.  That’s the same read ing as in the first quarter and in fact about the same reading as those over the past two years.   Similarly, the Michigan survey’s measure of expected inflation over the next  five to ten years remains unc hanged this past month at 2.8 percent.  And Michigan's measure of expected long-run inflation has not  changed a great deal during the past year or so.  The stability of these measures of long-run expected inflation suggests that people expect th e FOMC to keep inflation under control ove r the long run, which leads me to conclude that we still have the opportunity to take action to prevent recent higher monthly inflation number s from becoming embedded in expectations.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Mr. Chairman, in the Eighth District the stories that I hear as I wander around the District are very  much the same as they have been for the last six months or so.  I do get a sense that two things are perhaps a little differe nt.  One is that I hear more reports of what people are touting as a one-shot wage catch-up.  In other words, employers are not anticipating ongoing increases of a larger magnitude but ar e trying to catch up to the believe that more frequent reviews of compensa tion are taking place.  Firms that traditionally in recent years might have reviewed compensa tion and made adjustments once a year are now doing it more frequently, reviewing every six months, for example. My UPS and FedEx contacts suggest a signi ficant--I don’t want to exaggerate--but definite increase in the pressures they are seei ng.  They see greater pressures in the labor areas the pressures are above wh at they had anticipated.    52On the labor market side,                              said they are “struggling” in his words and are going to be adding incenti ves to attract workers.  They are short a substantial number of workers, particularly at                                  They have missed some of their delivery times because they don’t have enough manpower.  He sa id                                                                                                   and he char acterized the strains as clearly more intense than they were a year ago.                                says that his company is increasing entry level pay by 7 to 10 percent plus paying retention bonuses.  All                    operations  are under very substantial pressure.                    lowered the minimum scor es on its basic skills test for qualifying new blue-collar workers.  My contact also noted that his firm is expecting health care costs to be up 7 to 8 percent this year and 10 to 11 percent ne xt year.  And he says th at in talking to CFOs around the country he has the sens e that others expect much th e same.  This includes all the contacts he talks with on a regular basis. In terms of demand pressures, my UPS contact says that domestic volume is coming in much stronger than anticipated.  In his words, UPS is experiencing “just unbelievable domestic demand.”  Activity abroad is clearly very strong and my contact says that UPS now expects the volume in Europe  in 2001 to equal the volume previously anticipated for 2004.  That is, UPS has pulled fo rward three years its growth forecast for Europe.  Carriers are absolutely maxed out at cap acity on the Asia to U.S. routes and the firm is searching for more aircraft to expand capacity. Another interesting not e from my UPS contact was that  his firm and others in the air transportation business are expecting severe pr oblems this summer.  That, of course, is the peak period for travel and there are disruptions  because of thunderstorms and so forth.  But  53the expectation is that there will be subs tantial strains on infras tructure in the air transportation business in the United States. Let me make one comment on money growth, a topic that seems to have disappeared from our discussions.  I’ve looked at the data and I believe that money growth has not declined by anywhere near th e extent we have seen in othe r recent periods of monetary tightening.  I will use 12-month growth rates to illustrate my point.  Looking back to early 1989, after a period of monetary tightening that  started in 1987, 12-month M2 growth was down to about 3 percent and MZM growth was at about -2 percent.  By early 1995, M2 growth was below 1 percent and MZM growth was about -3 percent.  Currently, M2 growth is in the 5 to 6 percent ra nge on a 12-month basis and MZM growth is 7 to 8 percent.  I have the very distinct sense that despite the increases in in terest rates, we have just barely stayed ahead of the demand pressures.  There has been no re al restriction of mone tary policy taking place except possibly around the edges of the housing industry.  And, of course, that would be consistent with the numbers we are seeing on output .   There is no real restraint in place as yet.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Ninth District economy remains very strong for the most part and, if anything, we'v e seen an intensification of existing trends.  Employment gains have been sizable.  At the sa me time, people report that it has become even harder to find prospective employees acro ss the skills spectrum.  Help wanted signs proliferate virtually wherever one goes.  Disc retionary spending continues strong.  The most recent anecdote of this has to do with activity in the second home market in the resorts and retirement areas in the District, which are clear ly thriving.  Existing homes tend to be selling  54very rapidly throughout the District  at rising prices, and inventories of homes for sale are low.  We are also seeing some improvement in the na tural resource industrie s, including mining and agriculture. On the other side of the coin, I am heari ng of some signs that construction financing is getting harder to find for both residential a nd commercial construction.  I take that to mean that rates have gone up for those kinds of deals or  that in some cases people are getting turned away.  And at least one of the large developers based in our Di strict has indicated that his company is taking a much more cautious stance no w and is cutting back on activities in some of the hot markets in which it ha s been operating around the country.   There has also been some anxiety throughout  the District about what might happen at this meeting.  That anxiety is  hard to characterize.  It rang es from people who are afraid we will do too much to people who fear we will do too little.  So, there is no telling where the right button may be as far as  that audience is concerned. At the national level, I think prospects for real economic growth continue to look good.  The incoming data suggest that to me; the Greenbook forecast suggests that; and our own model forecast, which is a bit more c onservative than the Greenbook, still has very acceptable real growth.  On the inflation outl ook, I continue to be uncertain, perhaps even more uncertain than usual.  I, too, have been watching the incoming data and listening to talk about pressures here and there.  Obviously, take n at face value, those developments all raise concerns.  On the other hand, we have been doing  some serious empirical work on that issue, and that work suggests very modest increases in inflation from here  on out.  I will defer further comments on that perhaps until later in the meeting.  55Finally, I think there is a chance that we  may be seeing something significant going on in the stock market.  Dave Stockton comment ed on the flattening of the Wilshire 5000.  Obviously, some of the air has gone out of the NASDAQ.  That means the IPO market is a lot less receptive than it was a couple of months  ago, and that seems to me a potentially significant development if it persists.  I have no conviction about whethe r it will or won’t.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Second District economy grew at an exceptional pace in  the first quarter, but there are scattered signs that growth is moderating in the current quart er.  Price and wage pressures persist, though there are still no clear signs of  a broad-based acceleration in consumer prices.  Employment grew at a brisk pace in the first quarter despite persistent losses in the manufacturing sector.  Unemployment rates continue to reach new cyclical lows.  An early May heat wave appears to have buoyed retail sales in recent weeks followi ng a sluggish March and April.  But it's too early to gauge the monthly performance.  Pers istent tightness in bot h the residential and commercial real estate markets has pushed up rents and selling pr ices throughout the New York City area and has spurred increased construction and development.  Purchasing managers indicate that growth in the region's manufacturing sector moderated in April from its vigorous first-quarter pace while price pr essures persisted.  And finally, banks report stronger demand for consumer loans and commerc ial mortgages but weaker demand for home mortgages.  Banks also indicate further ti ghtening in credit standards and continued improvement in delinquency rates.  So, all of  the speeches that we have been giving for bankers to be prudent may just be having some effect.  56We believe that recent data make it even  clearer that reducing the imbalance between the unsustainable growth in dema nd and the capacity, though increasing, to produce goods and services is essential.  In addition to the data, anecdot al reports of wage and price pressures are becoming much more widespread a nd, therefore, those pres sures will show up in the data even if with some delay.  An increa sed pace of monetary tightening is needed for purely domestic reasons.  I don't think our task w ill be easy.  We have all been putting a great deal of emphasis on the wealth effect; it does have the advantage of being something that we can measure and calculate.  But I think somethi ng quite different could show up and make our task even harder as the measurable aspect of th e wealth effect diminishes.  The issue is:  Are we really in a different psychological climate after nine full years of  an economic expansion and the lowest unemployment rate since 1970?  Are we not in a period where Americans, whether or not they own stocks directly or indi rectly, are so absolutely convinced that this wonderful economy will continue that reining in demand will be  considerably more difficult than we are now predicting it to be?  In other wo rds, our task could be even greater than we expect.   I think the reasons for tightening domestica lly are very clear, but I am increasingly concerned about the international situation, espe cially in the emerging market countries.  The situation in Indonesia has wors ened again.  Thailand is doi ng less well.  Nobody knows for sure what could be involved in the suicide of the man who managed the very large foreign exchange reserves of China.  Korea’s very rapid recovery, a pure V- shaped one, has stymied much necessary structural reform.  In our own hemisphere, Venezuela and Colombia have serious political problems that are spilling over into the economic arena and Peru has also slipped, with a real question on the forthcomi ng election.  The severe drift in sub-Saharan  57Africa in every aspect--political, economic, a nd social--has now carri ed itself into South Africa, dramatized by the very severe weakening of its curren cy.  So, I think this rather disturbing background, which at least compensate s for some modest improvement possibly in Japan and in continental Europe, puts even grea ter urgency on the need for us to reduce the imbalances in our own economy.  I think it is very  important as the world situation gets worse that we get our own situation as shipshape as possible as soon as possible.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairma n.  Some members of the Committee have discussed our monetary policy in terms of r eal interest rate s--that if productivity shocks raise real interest rates, we must raise nominal interest rate s a like amount to avoid flooding the economy with liquidity.  While I cannot quarr el with this argument qualitatively, as a quantitative matter I think this line of thinking can mislead us.  If we follow this line, as I work it out we have already raised nominal inte rest rates more than is necessary to contain inflation.  Since I don't believe that, let me argue  against that particul ar way of rationalizing tighter monetary policy.   To see what the real inte rest rate reasoning suggests,  one needs a model of how productivity shocks affect long-run r eal interest rates.  It is a b it complicated to work that out.  And since Governor Meyer and I are both gettin g a little old to solve equilibrium growth models, we farmed out a request to the staff to  investigate the matter.  The memo the staff prepared in response showed that in a closed economy in long-run equili brium there is indeed a relationship in theory.  The most familiar case is where consumers are farsighted and rational and can anticipate future income grow th.  In these circumst ances consumption is sensitive both to real interest rates and expected growth rates; and in the long run real interest  58rates do in fact rise one-for-one with the expect ed growth rates.  The rationality assumptions in such a case are strong.  The memo also worked out the model with more simple-minded consumers following either a Keynesian consum ption function or that function augmented with a net worth term.  In these cases consump tion is relatively inelastic with respect to interest rates but the growth s hock shifts up investment demand a nd still raises interest rates, this time slightly more than one-for-one , though in these cases the outcomes depend on empirically estimated parameters. While these results seem clear enough, th ey are long run and assume a closed economy.  As for the long run, it does take a long  time to establish these equilibria, perhaps a world.  Suppose the productivity shock is not shared around the world, as by and large it does not seem to be currently.  In that case, the United States will just import capital and see its own real interest rate eventual ly driven back to the relativel y fixed world level, unless the United States is important enough to raise inte rest rates throughout the whole world.   The result is much less change in domestic real in terest rates than in the closed economy case--indeed, perhaps no change at all a nd a big importation of capital.   For what it is worth, actual data seem more consistent with the open economy scenario with the importation of capital that we  have talked about often in these meetings.  The behavior of current account deficits without the depreciati on of the dollar is perfectly consistent with the productivity shock occurring mainly in the United States.  On the rate side, since the beginning of the produc tivity shock the TIP rate ha s gone up by only about 40 basis points, much less than we would be predicting in the closed economy model.  Some measures  59of inflation-corrected interest rates have changed more, but I th ink that is because the nominal part of the Fisher equation has responded more th an the lagged inflation part of the equation.  That's Irving Fisher!  [Laughter] The point of going into all of this is a ne gative one.  As I said  above, I don't think the real interest rate link is a good line of reasoning for us to  use in our present deliberations.  Whatever the case in equilibrium closed economy models, the Committee is confronted with an earlier challenge: that of stabilizing infla tion.  If we tried to jus tify our action in long-run terms, some theorist out there would find us out and blow the whistle , especially since we have already raised nominal interest rates more  than would be predicte d by these theoretical conditions.  I think we should instead focus on the narrower short-term goal of stabilizing inflation, letting nominal and real interest rates eventually find their proper long-term levels.   This line of thinking leads me back to the inflation targeti ng approach I have trumpeted for the past few meetings and one th at you are probably getting sick of hearing about.  From this point of view, we want to keep the inflation ra te stable and we should just do whatever it takes to achieve that.  In this rega rd, I would note that the situation has worsened in the last month because inflation may actually  be beginning to increase, implying that our inflation fighting policies will have to be more forceful than would otherwise be the case.  This reasoning is reinforced by the Greenbook an alysis.  Because of the amply discussed new momentum in both consumption and investment, now  we have to get the funds rate into the mid-7 percent area fairly quickly to stabilize inflation.  Even the baseline forecast where the funds rate is rising to 7.25 pe rcent does not quite do that. Many of you have doubted this forecast be cause of skepticism about the Greenbook analysis and forecast.  There are grounds for such skepticism but other indicators are not  60much more reassuring this time around.  The pipeli ne measure of inflation, unit labor costs, is now beginning to rise partly b ecause the first-quarter productiv ity change was a bit soft and partly because wages also seem to be growing more rapidly.  The lack of a further productivity pickup in the first quarter was mildly  disappointing, but that might also serve as a reality check because we have been relying on productivity to rescue us from scattered inflation warnings and maybe now we should take these warn ings a bit more seriously. Unlike the case at our recent meetings, other forecasters also have inflation increasing at least in the short term.  The Blue Chip forecasters are predicting a rise in short-term inflation and have raised that forecast in recent months.  They also get that forecast by assuming higher short-term interest rates, showin g that they really th ink monetary policy has to be tightened to avoid accelerating long-term  inflation.  The Michigan consumers have recently begun expecting higher short-term infla tion, as have the Philadelphia Fed forecasters and various NAPM, NFIB, and NABE surveys.  The Treasury bond market has also switched and is now indicating somewhat more future  long-term inflation as measured by the increasing spread between the nominal and real  10-year Treasury rates.  All approaches suggest that tightening is needed  and all have changed from a month ago in the direction of expecting higher inflation.  I th ink there is more pressure on us than there was a month ago. Lastly, a strong argument for our policy of gradualism has been that it was expected by financial markets.  Now that, too, may be ch anging.  From the fed funds futures market one can compute a two-thirds probability that we will abandon our gradualist policy at this meeting.  These results are confirmed by direct  surveys of Fed watchers.  Unlike the recent past, financial markets seem to be expecting us  to move more forcef ully against inflation,  61which opens up a window of opportunity for us to  do just that.  From all of this you can probably tell where I would come out on policy today.  Thank you very much. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, the Tenth District remains generally healthy.  Employment growth is still r unning around 2 percent and we ha ve an unemployment rate of about 3 percent.  But I thought I would take  just a minute to convey some anecdotal information on the District, which supports what Mike Moskow said in his comments in that to some degree it shows a change in  the tone within the District.   First on wages and prices, there has been a subtle move toward pressing for higher wages and some efforts to raise prices.  We met last week with both our economic advisory council and our board of directors.  Fairly ge nerally we heard from labor, including unions, that they are beginning to ask for a little more on th e wage front, 4 to 6 percent.  But also they are focusing very heavily on the benefits side, recognizing rising health-care costs and wanting to keep those benefits up and recogni zing, too, that benefits are the nontaxable portion of income gains.  Even among the non- union groups, there is continued pressure for wage increases and we are hearing more about that. On the pricing side, we are still hearing the story that firms cannot pass on their higher costs through price increases, but we are h earing about more attempts to do so.  In our area of Oklahoma and of Colorado there have be en attempts to move prices up, say, 4 or 5 percent.  Of that, maybe 1 percent will stick; but the fact is that the 1 pe rcent is sticking.  So, we do see that taking place.  Nevertheless, we ar e also hearing from the same individuals that they sense some slowing in their regional econom ies.  The obvious case is real estate.  We are seeing a fairly significant drop in housing demand in the Lincoln, Nebraska area, for example,  62and some slowing, though not a decline, in Kansas  City.  Denver remains very strong, and we are also seeing some carryover of that strength re flected in manufacturi ng, especially if it is related to the real estate sect or--in home improvement, say--though there’s just a hint of that. Turning to the national economy, our projec tion is very similar to that of the Greenbook except for one important difference, whic h is that the moderation in growth in our forecast comes with a less aggr essive interest rate move.  Having said that, with the information we are getting on wage pressures, I would agree with those who suggest that we will need to continue to move rates up somewh at.  One thing I want to caution about, and I hinted at it earlier in my questi on to Mike Prell, is that I think we want to be careful not to get “sweaty hands" with respect to our policy of gradualism in moving the funds rate up.  From one point of view, we started th is tightening when the funds ra te was 4-3/4 percent and it is now at 6 percent.  We know that a good portion of the effects of that increase has not yet played out.  We know there are lags in policy.  We know that the budget surplus is increasing, and that has an impact that we have to keep in mind.  Considering that and the lags, it seems to me that the gradualis t approach with quarter-p oint increases is still appropriate rather than suddenly moving forward to a more aggressive  policy.  That is particularly noteworthy because, while we may not be at th e right rate yet, we started at  4-3/4 percent and are now at 6 percent, which certainly makes more sense today than it did a year ago.  So, while I would readily agree that we need to keep the pressu re on the economy, I think there is something to be said for staying with a gradualist approach.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan. MR. JORDAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On several recent road trips through the District to host meetings for bankers, I had the impression that in at least one dimension  63there has been a distinct slowing.  And that is that th e spring crop of orange  traffic barrels has been the best ever and is coming close to the ob jective of blocking at l east one lane of every major road!  [Laughter]  Contractors and uni on leaders say that there is enough money to obstruct even more traffic if only they could find the laborers.  [Laughter]  One claim I’ve heard is that there are no unemployed constr uction workers.  In thinking about what is happening, I don't think I want to tell you any more about the outlook for public sector construction through the forecast horizon because  there's nothing that monetary policy is going to do about that now or for any time horizon that  we care about.  The revenue is there; it will be spent.  The stadiums are under way; highway programs are under way.  The money is available and it is going to be  spent.  So I am just going to stop talking about that! Let me shift to other labor topics.  Some of this reflects the lagged effects of earlier developments.  Chairman Greenspan has cited He rb Stein as saying that  unsustainable things have a habit of ending.  I will tell you that th ere is a new definition of overbuilding in the retail construction sector.  A comp any that builds very, very large stores that sell a variety of items--groceries, what we would call department  store goods, hardware, and so on--just built a major facility in the north area of Columbus, a rapid growth area.  The opening of the store was set for May 1st and they needed to hire 800 people.  They began advertising for help with a starting wage of $8 an hour.  The week before  the scheduled May 1st opening they had only 200 applications.  They have now delayed the op ening for at least a month and have raised their offering rate to $10 an hour and have their fingers crossed that it wi ll attract the workers they need. Employees of hospitals in the area gave us some startling reports.  Normally there is a cooperative relationship between the Clev eland Fed and the Atlanta Fed on the payments  64system.  But that’s not the case in health care.  Cincinnati area hospitals say that their employees are being offered bonuses of $5,000 by A tlanta hospitals plus a year's free rent to relocate to Atlanta.  Some Cincinnati area hospitals are approaching employees of other hospitals and offering them $2,000 just to move acr oss the street or across town.  A Columbus hospital said that it ha s shut down three operating rooms in  the face of a 100-nurse shortage. The lack of labor and the implications of that have led to our hearing more stories about companies choosing not to expand in our ar ea or choosing to relocate or add additional capacity in Mexico.  It is not at  all a sucking sound but it is a phenomenon of the type of labor that I report to you that they now want  a complete and unconditional amnesty for undocumented workers.  That would help th e INS problem in Indiana and they could concentrate on the southern part of Jack Guynn’s District!  [Laughter]  He also wanted us to be aware that there is a possibility of a nati onwide strike against Ge neral Electric involving five unions in a dispute over pensions.  Another sort of silver-lining as pect of the tightness in labor markets is the increased emphasis on labo r substitution investments.  A contact from a company that ships out merchandise through Inte rnet and 800 number ca talogs sales--mainly gifts of its dessert products--sai d that a year ago their shipping  cost per gift was $1.06.  They have had an 8 percent across-th e-board wage increase and even higher benefit cost increases and have reduced their cost per gift to $.96.  So, productivity still is helping us out. And as we head from spring into summer, em ployers in the services sector say it is going to be a very tough season for our amusem ent parks.  Cedar Point wants to hire 4,000 workers for the summer and they expect                                          of those will be foreign students.  They are using hiring or retention bon uses as well as free or heavily subsidized  65housing to try to attract them.  All of the major amusement pa rks in the region are increasing prices.  The smallest increase of  5.4 percent is at a park that increased its fee 10 percent last year.  The highest is at Cedar Point, with a 15 percent increase in admission price.  We have been told that admission at Six Flags in New England will be up 22 percent for this summer.  And increases in parking fees are said to averag e 10 percent.  We’ve had reports of other price increases of note.  One was a 33 percent increase in paper costs.  These, of course, are all relative price increases and you a ll know that.  Another, which was reported in this morning’s Wall Street Journal , was that Chubb Insurance is raising premiums.   A major worldwide supplier for the mo tor vehicle and housing industries,                                                                    said that  its suppliers are asking for relief from the price caps in their long-term contracts.  He said  that with the strength  in recent orders from Europe, Asia, and Latin America--in his words it is the first time all global markets are coming in strong--they expect to be able to renegotiate the price caps and to pass the higher costs on to consumers.   All of these anecdotal reports of tight labo r markets, increasing cost pressures, and efforts to raise prices are the lagged effects of the very strong final demand that we have experienced--with an emphasis on the past tense of the commen t.  Very recently there are some tentative indications that growth in fi nal demand is moderating, perhaps in response to the policy actions taken since last June.  In re cent meetings with dir ectors, advisory council members, and bankers we’ve heard many more sugge stions that a degree of caution is starting to be reflected in the behavior of both busines ses and consumers.  Certainly the combination of higher energy costs and higher de bt servicing burdens is starti ng to have an impact.  I look forward to the June meeting, our Humphrey-H awkins meeting, when we will get a longer- 66term perspective on the outlook beyond 2001.  That’s  because the effects of actions we have already taken as well as any action we take toda y will really influence that period much more than the short term. We are now experiencing a very familiar pattern.  Once we start raising the federal funds rate, market participants and Fed watche rs talk about how far we will have to go and they extrapolate that to ever-higher rates.  In February of 1995 when we had previously increased the fed funds rate to 6 percent, the futu res rate five months out  indicated a funds rate of 7-3/4 percent.  And some commentators were talking about a ra te over 8 percent.  Nevertheless, we stopped at 6 percent.  We disappointed them and we were right.  In very vocal Fed watcher said that we would cut the rate to 3 per cent.  We did not and we were right.  The point is that the one thing that is ce rtain is that we will need to stop raising the fed funds rate long before the commentators and th e fed funds futures markets say we will.  And the question of when to pause cannot be avoided.  I think we are now much closer to that point, possibly with an action at  this meeting, than is suggest ed by the assumptions behind the baseline forecast. I have one little comment on th e issue of raising the real  fed funds rate--which is what some of my staff occasiona lly refer to--or otherwise raising real interest rates, let alone real exchange rates.  We don't raise and lower real interest rates.  The markets do that.  Fundamental forces of all types in fluence real interest rates and real exchange  rates.  The issue is not that but where we are pegging the nominal  fed funds rate--the ove rnight interbank rate--relative to market determined rates, nominal as  well as real.  I now think that even talking about the concept of real interest rates is not only  not useful but counterpr oductive.  It is really  67The issue is the nominal fed funds rate and wh ether we have it at the right level to be consistent with an expansion of central bank li quidity that is consistent with what’s going on in the economy. I was pleased to hear the Vice Chairman ’s remarks and caution to the Committee about the international situation.  I think that is very important .  It probably doesn’t get as much attention as it should, especially in the environment in which we find ourselves.  It is always difficult to make monetary policy in pr esidential election years, including Mexico’s presidential election years, as we ha ve seen many times in the past.   Our objective, of course, is stable purc hasing power of the dollar for our economy.  But increasingly that means for a lot of other eco nomies, too.  Our policies, as we are seeing, do affect foreign countries’ policie s and, therefore, foreign economi es.  And that feeds back to affect our economy and our ability to achieve a soft landing, in line with the points of concern that Vince Reinhart raised in his remarks.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. MR. MCTEER.   Overall economic growth in  the Eleventh District remains quite healthy.   However, a few signs of slower growth  in response to higher in terest rates are just beginning to appear.  At our boa rd of directors meeting last Thursday, we heard more of a mixed picture on the economy than we have in  quite some time.  In the Dallas area the demand for large custom homes has slowed notic eably in the last month, probably in response to the lower and more volatile stock market.  In Houston the housing market is said to be doing well but much less so than a few months  ago.  Throughout Texas, with the possible exception of Austin, nonresidential constructi on of all types--offices, commercial space,  68roads, and other infrastructure--has continued th e slide that began in January.  On the other hand, one of our directors from the                            industry noted that she is seeing the strongest growth in electronics in four years.   Purchases of PCs by businesses have begun to pick up.   Labor shortages are still the most comm on anecdote.  It has even spread to academia where “raiding” parties are trying to recruit away faculty members.  In Austin, where shortages of high-tech la bor have persisted for a longer time than in other parts of Texas, some employers have been giving quarterly  rather than annual salary increases, as Bill Poole reported for his District.  In spite of th e pressures on wages, ther e are few examples of businesses passing on higher input prices unless the increases are rela ted to higher energy costs.  In that regard, during my cab ride here yesterday I noticed a litt le sign in the cab that said a 50-cent surcharge was being added because  of higher fuel costs, with dates indicating the time period during which the surcharge woul d be applicable.  Nevertheless, there are exceptions.  In Texas competitive pressure s are keeping a lid on chemical prices. Texas oil and gas employment is finally responding to the now fairly sustained higher prices we have had.  Oil and gas empl oyment increased in March at a rate of 6.4 percent, the rig count is rising, and well permits increased in th e first quarter in Texas from 793 to 1,121.   On the subject of automobiles that Mike Moskow was talking about earlier, let me pass on a comment of one of                                                                  who owns some car dealerships.  He was telling me how remarkable  it is that when one part of the country experiences a shift in purchasi ng, the pattern is almost iden tical all over the country; it’s  69uncanny the way the country moves together on that .  And he reported that in early May sales dropped off quite considerably in those d ealerships with which he is familiar. At the national level, it is a little harder to find consistent responses to the Fed's rate hikes.  Last month's weakness in retail sales co uld be the start of a new trend, but it is too early to judge.  Housing demand probably ha s begun to deteriorate, but a rush to buy in anticipation of further increases in intere st rates may have masked the underlying deterioration.  April’s down-drift in the stoc k market could produce a notable reverse wealth effect for the remainder of the year.  This  morning's CPI number serves as a hopeful suggestion that we may not be guilty of doing too little too late or be behind the curve.  Our gradualist approach has served us well and I see no compelling reasons to depart from that strategy.  An upcreep in inflation pressures calls for a measured re sponse and continued vigilance.  Or, as Tom Hoenig put it, let's not get “sweaty hands."  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In light of the time I will shorten what I otherwise would have said, but I do want to  say a couple of things.  First, I agree with others that the incoming data since we last  met generally support our  ongoing vigilance and concern on the inflation front, but to me those data do not indicate that the war is lost or that we have fallen behind the curve.  I tend to ag ree that inflation risks have picked up and I, therefore, think that we should continue to act, and probably with a slight ly greater sense of urgency, in order to achieve  balance in our economy. As for the factors that suggest  the risks of inflation are, if anything, perhaps a little stronger, a number of people ha ve talked about the role of consumer behavior, and I would endorse that view.  We have also  talked about a number of othe r indicators of tightening in the  70economy that had been very quiet and seem to have suddenly come awake.  Let me just put two on the table that have not come up thus far.   Capacity utilization, which had fallen out of favor as a topic of discussion ar ound this table in the last two y ears, appears to be reemerging as an indicator of resource tightness.  At about 81.4 percent that measure has reached its highest reading in two years.  Similarly, the labor force part icipation rate, which had been mysteriously quiescent, also appe ars to have returned to a slightly more normal pattern for a strong economy, edging up to 67-½ percent, which is well above the average that prevailed for the three previous years. To a degree, ther efore, I think strong dema nd-led and investment-led growth is forcing some of the usual indicat ors of resource tightness to return to a more normal pattern.   These elements of resource tightness I thi nk are starting to show through a bit both in costs and possibly in price pr essures.  Employment costs did jump 1-¼ percent in the first quarter, the fastest pace since 1989, which supports the notion that strain ed labor markets are starting to have an impact.             Some of the survey data, including those from small businesses, also show that compensation costs are increasing.  I view that as important supporting data.  More broadly on the inflation front, the GDP deflator posted its largest increase in three years in the first quarter.  And as others have indicated, short- term inflation expectations have moved up for the public at large.  Purchasing managers also seem to sense a tightening tone in prices.   However, I think all is not lost on the in flation front, and I believe there are some real arguments for a less bleak picture.  The CPI number for March was probably a bit of an anomaly, with much of the uptick in prices in  the lodging component, which was a replay of   71figures, there is a possibility, as President McTe er has indicated, that perhaps we are seeing a bit of a slowing but it’s too early to say for su re.  More importantly in my view, the financial few others have commented on in flation expectations and, contra ry to what some have said, I’m not sure that I have seen an increase th ere.  I looked at the yield spread on 10-year Treasury bills versus 10-year TIPs .  And at least on the chart in front of me the spread seems to have picked up a little starting in October 1998 until a bout the middle of 1999 and, with two wobbles, then settled down at  around 2 percent.  Of course, one can read a wobble up or down and either weigh it heavily or not weigh it  very strongly at all.  But contrary to the staff’s forecast, the markets are not suggesting a strong increase in inflation expectations in my view.  Needless to say, Mike Prell has put on the table the question of whether the market has it right or the forecasters ha ve it right.  And since I am ne ither a market participant nor a forecaster, I will let time tell on that one.    The second point I would note on this front, which again is not statistically proven, is that one could reasonably expect that the r ecent stock market volatility would in fact damp consumer expenditures somewhat.  The third poi nt I would note is th at we know corporate bond rates have increased noticeably since the st art of the year, just as the issuance of corporate debt has also been cut back.  So, both developments in the corporate bond markets have the effect, I think, of amplifying our tig htening moves and forcing borrowers back to banks, where conditions on both loan  rates and terms or availability do seem to be tightening.  So, I believe there are reasons to think that some of our actions have been noticed by the  72Finally, I’d underscore a point that Firs t Vice President Stone and a couple of others made, which is that long-term inflati on expectations have not moved appreciably.  Given this configuration, I beli eve that perhaps we should move a bit more aggressively than in the past, but not signal that we are concerned that the inflation genie is out of the bottle.  While the risks may be somewhat heightened, I do not believe that we are clearly behind the curve.  I think the market is helping us in so me ways.  And I would join with a number of the Reserve Bank Presidents and First Vice Presid ent Stone in suggesting, as President Hoenig said, that we not have “sweaty palms" here.  On the other hand, I think some action today clearly will help us to reinfo rce a market perception.  If we can do that without overshooting, I think we can prove that Mike Prell, while he wi ll be missed, has left the institution capable of making some good judgme nts.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Th e Bluebook gets to the heart of what has changed and what has not changed since our  last meeting.  I quote:  “… incoming data suggested both that aggregate demand had con tinued to grow more rapidly than potential supply and that wage and price developments we re becoming more worrisome."  So what has not changed is the momentum in demand a nd production and the imbalance between the growth in production and in pot ential supply.  But the quote do es not make entirely clear whether the staff was referring to an imbala nce in the growth rates between demand and potential supply or in the levels  of actual and potent ial output.  It occurs to me that the ambiguity might have been intentional to allow each of us to interp ret the observation in a way that we could accept.  But I believe anot her critical and persisting element is a large imbalance between the levels of actual and potential output.  This vi ew is very consistent with  73the Greenbook and many other forecasts and it does suggest that we  have a significant challenge ahead of us.  I don't know if we have  “sweaty palms" or even if I have “sweaty palms," but I think the challenge is quite consid erable.  And it is along the lines that I think Mike Prell laid out very well in  his presentation.  By the way, I thought that was a particularly insightful presentation, although I should note that I always tend to find presentations insightful when they tend to conf irm my own bias.  [Laughter]   

[SECTION]

MR. PRELL.  I will take half a loaf! MR. MEYER.  But this is a good point for me to say how much I have valued your presentations to the Committee during my tenur e here.  And you really ended on a high note today! So, what has changed?  Well, first of all utilization rates have increased slightly further.  There should not be any surprise abou t that.  As long as demand is growing faster than potential supply, of course utilization rates will increase.  Now, I re cognize that monetary policy acts with a lag, but my view is that the restraint we have put in  place since last summer is not sufficient.  The virtual absence of signs of  slowing suggests that if we don't take further steps to slow demand growth, utilization ra tes will most likely increase still further. A second change is that infl ation has become both more of  a reality and more of a threat.  It is more of a threat because of still high utilization rates and continued above-trend growth.  But it is more than a threat.  We ar e seeing, I believe, the beginning of a pickup in inflation rates for both compensa tion and core consumer prices. Certainly one can find some mixed signals, but I view the data on balance as quite compelling.  There is a conflict among some of  the data on wages and compensation, but on the basis of both the ECI and the higher freque ncy data for average hourly earnings I think it  74is clear that we are at an infl ection point here.  To me this assessment is very consistent with the reports summarized in the Beigebook and with  the anecdotal reports that I am hearing as the various state banking groups visit the Board. As for inflation, President Parry mentione d that the core PCE was moving up.  Its 12-month rate is now 1.8 percent, which is the highest rate of increase since October 1997.  And it has moved up 0.4 percentage poi nt since just the e nd of last year.  In terms of the core CPI, of course, its 12-month rate is the same as it was a year ago.  But if I look at the pattern, I see that beginning in September the monthly increas es were rather consis tently higher.  I note that of the next four months to be dropped out of the 12-month core CPI, three of them were 0.1 percent and one was 0.2 percen t.  So, I think the 12-month rate is moving up from being around 2 percent to being around 2-1/2 percent, cons istent with what we are seeing in the core PCE.  Again, why should we be surprised?  Given the prevailing uti lization rates and the dissipation or reversal of favorab le supply shocks, some deteriorat ion in inflation is what most forecasters have been expecting. I think the third change is in the nature of the forecast errors.  For a very long time we have been saying faster-than-expected gr owth and lower-than-expected inflation.  No more.  So far this year there is relatively litt le surprise about the st rength of growth, which remains robust.  And some key inflation data ar e now coming in either worse than expected or at least confirming expectations of an increase in inflation pressures--particularly, as I said, the core PCE and CPI measures, the ECI, and av erage hourly earnings.  Th is reflects, in my view, the fact that the dominance of favorab le supply shocks is receding.  And as a consequence, the implications of the supply/de mand imbalance are coming into clearer focus.  75At the end of last year there was a bold  headline in the Wall Street Journal:  “So long supply and demand.”  I have been waiting for a new headline: “Welcome back supply and demand.”  And then today in the Wall Street Journal  on the front page there is an article about firms starting to raise pri ces.  It begins, “Even in the ne w economy at least one old rule still applies:  If demand exceeds supply for l ong enough, sellers will raise prices."  Our job is clear.  We must restore the balance between supply and demand.  Until we do so, the threat and reality of higher inflation are likely to remain with us. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley. MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Once again it seems that the basic conditions facing the Committee ar e little changed from those pr evailing at the time of the most recent several meetings, except that pe rhaps many now familiar concerns have been escalating further.  The economy has turned in another remarkable quarter, and recently hard evidence has begun to replace earlie r perceptions that compensati on increases are accelerating and some measures of inflation may now be on the move.  There is little point in further reciting the factors at work here.  It appears clear from this disc ussion that most, if not all, of those around the table see the risks as continuing  to be heavily on the up side, with further policy moves in order.  As the Bluebook discusse s, the operative question is:  By how much? There are a number of reasons to feel it is  unlikely that inflati on is suddenly about to surge.  Among other factors the dollar remains re markably strong.  Oil prices appear to have peaked and commodity prices generally have fl attened out.  Productivity  increases continue to hold unit cost increases at bay.  And the im pact of policy easing in the fall of 1998 should be dissipating while the tighten ing over the past year should increasingly be kicking in.  I believe we are still on or perhaps still ahead of the curve, although some inflation creep  76seems inevitable.  However, any signs of econom ic slowing are scattered at best and quite inadequate in my view to provi de confidence that the needed eas ing of activity is likely to occur without significant additiona l policy moves.  It is helpful that both the real economy and financial markets today seem to be presenting us an unusual window.  The more aggressive policy path is both expected and by many considered acceptable and is thus likely to present less risk than the more conservative alternative in the near as well as the longer term.  I believe we should grasp this opportunity.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It is a little late but let's go for coffee if it's there.  It is probably iced coffee at this point! [Coffee break] 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mr. Lindsey. 

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  As indicated in  the Bluebook, the issue today would appear to be not whether to co ntinue to tighten monetary policy at this meeting but rather by how much.  At the March meeting, the Committee contemplated future fi rming, and its public statement conveyed its sense that the balance of risks was pointed toward higher inflation.  Incoming data since that time have on balance strengthened the impression of inflation risks.  Th e most obvious contenders for policy action today are increases of e ither 25 or 50 basis points.  As Mike indicated, core inflation picks up further next year in the staff forecast.  That forecast essent ially is consistent with continued gradual increases in the f unds rate target this year.  For example, increases of 25 basis points at this and each of the next four FOMC meetings, followed by a constant 7-1/4 percent funds rate through next year, would comport reasonably well with the policy assumption in the Greenbook.  By our reading of term premiums, the 7-1/4 percent funds rate next year would also be somewhat higher than th e expected peak for that rate that appears to be currently built into financial asset prices.  The projected result of these financial conditions would be a core PCE inflation over next year of 2.4 percent, after an ex pected 2.2 percent ov er this year.  Because labor markets would still be experiencing an unsustainable degree of pressure late next year, the pr ocess of underlying price acceleration would persist beyond that time.   77The case for the 25 basis point move  at today’s meeting could rest on the judgment that extending the prev ious series of quarter point moves today, and perhaps continuing that p ace at later meetings, would have a reasonable chance of keeping core infl ation contained, in contrast to the staff view.  A supporter of another gradual move might believe that the staff has overestimated the ongoing strength of aggregate demand.  In this view, as a result of the recent greater stringency in credit markets and weaker behavior of the stock market, economic  growth may already be poised to slow appreciably, perhaps by enough to  match the expansion of potential supply.    Support for a 25 basis point move also might derive from the view that the growth of potentia l supply itself probably will continue to pick up next year, as structural productivity a ccelerates further.  Another step-up in trend productivity growth could temporarily hold down unit labor costs even if wage gains are trending higher in response to taut labor markets.  Other things equal, real private interest rates ev entually would have to reach still higher levels at some point, but the need to get there is not urgent, given this near-term depressa nt to inflation.  And, of course, continuing even a gradual pace of tightening for an extended period would eventually produce large increases in nominal short-term interest rates, and in real short-term interest rate s as well unless infl ation expectations rise appreciably.  The Committee could also want added evidence on the level of resource use that will provoke price acceleration.  The staff may have overestimated the extent to which the economy in the longer run is inflation-prone.  Especially if the long-run NAIRU is substantially lower than the staff has estimated, continue d gradualism may not be likely to allow a continuing, underlying accelerati on of prices.  From a long-term perspective, the surprisingly favorable  inflation and output performance of the U.S. economy over the second half of the 1990s understandably has fostered a greater sense of uncertainty  about economic relationships.  This observation might well be interprete d as providing support for staying with the gradual policy approach us ed by the Committee to date.  Also, this year’s generally stronger-t han-expected data on real GDP, employment, and inflation could be perc eived as more noise than signal.  But this result rests on a number of  demand and supply forces evolving favorably over coming months.   A less optimistic view of the probable balance of supply and demand--for example, as seen in the staff forecast--would support adopting the 50 basis point opti on today.  The Committee may be particularly concerned about the po tential for accelerating prices under  78continued gradualism.  A 50 basis point move could be motivated by the view that the more restrictive fi nancial conditions associated with adopting the aggressive policy approac h, at least at this meeting, would offer a better chance of containing in flation, while still not seriously risking an excessive degree of firm ing.  The more aggressive strategy would lessen the potential for policy being “too little, too late” and for allowing a significant increase in inflati on that would be hard to reverse.  In this view, the perceived expectation in a statistical sense of the costs of an inflationary outcome--that is, the probability of it occurring times the welfare cost if it does--would be high enough to outweigh the smaller perceived expectation of the costs of  a tighter-than-need ed policy inducing unwanted economic weakness.  The arguments for a 50 basis point  move today might seem even more compelling to the extent that  the Committee was persuaded by the discussion in the “Alternative Simula tions” section of Part I of the Greenbook, based on the FRB/US model, which Mike also alluded to.  That section suggested that next year’s  acceleration of core prices can only be short-circuited by a su bstantial steepening of th e trajectory of policy tightening.  For example, if the FOMC we re to raise the f unds rate in four steps of 50 basis points each this y ear--and were to keep the resulting 8 percent level constant through next y ear--then in the simulation core PCE inflation would be held to a little ab ove 2 percent in both years.  This extent of policy tightening would succeed in capping core inflation in part through its effects on the dollar and on longer-term inflati on expectations.  In addition, the slowdown of real GDP growth to only 3-1/4 percent next year would raise unemployment to a 4-1/4 percent rate  by the fourth quarter.  Labor markets would be on a path to reach sustainable conditions later on.  The Committee’s choice of the bala nce of risk statement with a 50 basis point move would be  somewhat less clear-cut than with a 25 basis point move.  In the latter case, a continued tilt toward inflation would seem to be the obvious choice.  But as I just indicated, even with a 50 basis point rate hike, the staff believe s that further substantial funds rate increases would be needed to prevent inflationary pressures from emerging.  Thus, even with a half poin t action today, in our  view inflation risks would still dominate.  The Committee may agree with this judgment, although you no doubt depart in various ways from the point estimates of the Greenbook’s projections.  If the Committee instead believes that the sizable 50 basis point move has an excel lent chance of balancing the risks, it should indicate that.  The new lang uage does not reference the future course of policy, so if the Committee still suspects that the risks are unbalanced but wants to pause for a while to weigh the effects of accelerated tightening, it would need to indicate this intent in a separate sentence in the announcement.     79 The current funds market futures quote for May of 6.23 percent implies that the odds that market partic ipants put on a 1/2 percentage point move today have moved somewhat be low yesterday’s odds of about two-thirds.  Anecdotal reports suggest that they also expect the FOMC statement to maintain a sense of unbala nced risks toward inflation.  Thus, the rate move part of this combina tion might be enough of a surprise to raise interest rates a little across th e maturity spectrum.  Combining a 1/2 point hike with a balanced statemen t about the risks would represent two surprises in offsetting directions.  And the difficulty of predicting the reaction of puzzled market particip ants makes the direction of the immediate interest rate adjustments uncertain, although the change in market rates would probably be muted.  Thank you.  That concludes my prepared remarks.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What actually happened, in basis points, to the federal funds futures rate for June as  a consequence of the CPI release? 

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I have the May figure; I do not have the June figure.  Does someone have that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Wh at is the May figure? 

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  The May figure as of a bout 11 o'clock this morning was 6.225 for the futures rate. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I just want the change.   MR. LINDSEY.  Let me give you yesterda y's.  We had 6.23 for May, although that was rounded. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And what do you have now? MR. LINDSEY.  We have 6.225 now.  A signi ficant change that also affects the calculation of odds is not just this futures rate but, believe it or not , today's spot rate.  That rate is 6.4375, or 6-7/16 percent.  So those are the tw o relevant new pieces of information that we got today that affect these odds.  80

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions?  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  David, you started with a refe rence to the risks at  our last meeting as we stated them but also to the forecast a nd discussion of the risks around the table.  But then you ended with the focus on the interpretation of our statements of the balance of risks.  Isn't it the case, as long as there are lags--and maybe long and variable lags--that there will be a time when we will stop raising the funds rate when the risks of reported inflation are still rising?  We cannot wait until we have seen the first break toward a downward trend in inflation or we are going to cause a recession for sure.  So there has to be a time when, in spite of what the futures market projections say and in spite of what the forecasts and projections say, we stop.  Suppose we raised the funds rate  by 125 basis points today to 7-1/4 percent.  Wouldn’t the risk still be that inflati on in the month ahead would be higher? 

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I’m not sure that the senten ce on the balance of risks refers to the month ahead or even the next few months. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  That is why I am raising the question. 

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  Exactly.  In the case you cited, that really is an issue the Committee would have to confront .  That is, the Committee may e xpect inflation rates for the next three months to continue on the high side at least, though  maybe not rising, and then ebb down.  The question the Committee would then face is what to indicate with respect to the balance of risks.  If I were a member of th e Committee, I guess I would tend to say that the risks would be balanced.  So, even if I thought we might have some di sappointing readings for a few months, I would be tempted to look even further ahead into the foreseeable future, which is longer than three months, and make  a statement that the risks were generally balanced.  But I admit it would be a temptation not to say that.  81

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Let me follow up.  Suppose my own model had really long lags--I used to think the lag was about two years--and I think that the stance of policy today affects the inflation rate in 2002.  And my guess is that inflation is going to rise for the next year and a half no matter what we do, just due to good ol d-fashioned momentum.   Then how do I use this balance of risks statement as a communica tion device for people out there looking at it?  How do I handle that communications problem? 

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  I may actually wish to turn  to other members of the Committee to answer that!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Let me step into the staff role here.  What we've worked hard on in developing this language is to try to ge t in this concept of the “foreseeable future,” which is clearly meant to be longer than the in termeeting period and longer  even than after the next meeting.  As the working group and the Committee talked about this, frankly, I think most people thought the foreseeable future enco mpassed something like the lag that you are discussing.  Obviously, it would be a judgment call.  But if we  thought that we had put in enough tightening today that we would slow infl ation over a period of let’s say 18 months or so, it would not be unreasonable to say in this st atement that we think the risks are balanced for the foreseeable future.  It is clearly longer than three mont hs.  I think most people viewed it as longer than three months and probably so mewhere on the order of a year to eighteen months.  Needless to say, we didn’t try to tie ourselves down explicitly. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  May I ask from that whether it is intended to be interpreted that we could at some point say with this act ion we now see the risks as balanced? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  That is intended to be a possibility, yes.  It is also quite possible, though, that we might sa y we have taken this tighteni ng action but we still do not see  82the risks as balanced just yet.  However, the reason we have not tightened further, obviously, is that we are waiting for incoming data and a va riety of other things so  that we can make a more informed judgment.  In fact, since we’ve used this formulation, we have had the option of both raising rates but also sayi ng that the risks were a little unbalanced.  And it is also true, as you made quite clear, that th e market--I think appropriately--i nterprets statements that the risks are not balanced or more toward inflati on as at least a possibili ty, though not a certainty, that we will continue to raise rates.  So we should not prete nd that we have broken that link because it is still there, but it is not as strong as it had been before. 

[SECTION]

MR. LINDSEY.  If I could just interject to  answer the Chairman 's earlier question, the 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions for David?  If not, let me focus on the previous conversation because it really covers th e issues that I think confront us.  My own judgment, and what I plan to recommend to the Committee, is that we have an opportunity now to move the funds rate up 50 basis points, remain asymmetric, and effectively adjust our longer-term posture to a be tter position than the one we are in at the moment.  The reason I am not concerned about moving the rate up quickly at this stage is that I think the evidence indicates that productiv ity, indeed perhaps underlying GDP, is still accelerating.  I recognize that the staff’s estimat e of productivity growth for the first quarter, based on the latest published figures and adjust ed for the defense spending anomaly, is 1-½ percent.  I don’t believe that estimate for a fraction of a second.  I don't think it has even a remote possibility of being accura te because of the evidence we  are getting on profit margins, which clearly are still opening up at this point.  Indeed, using th e available data on income and profits, which essentially reflect the unit cost  structure of nonfinancial corporations, the  83productivity growth number that falls out of th at system according to staff estimates is a 6 percent annual rate. That number is consistent with our unit cost analyses and our estimates for prices, profits, and wages, granted that the estimate for wages may be a little to the weak side. I would submit that what is creating a 1- 1/2 percent estimate for productivity growth is the combination of a peculiar st atistical discrepancy and some very dubious data in areas of the economy other than nonfinanci al corporations; the latter provide our most reliable underlying data. The general view of a persis ting acceleration in productivity  is being picked up in a lot of the company reports where shortages of important inputs report edly are beginning to arise. These are particularly acute in the high-t ech area.  Intel is in difficulty.  Cisco is in difficulty.  The problem of semiconductor shorta ges as a consequence of the earthquake in Taiwan has left some very deep pressures in its wake.  One reason is that the effects of network externalities in the hi gh-tech area of our economy are cl early beginning to show up in an exaggerated manner.  That is, as we are all aware and as I have mentioned previously, when we go from two-at-a-time connections to large network connections, the benefits do not just go up arithmetically; they go up exponentiall y. The network externalities effect of our high-tech system is creating a major underlying acceleration in the economy. All the problems we have discussed previ ously, mainly the pressures on the safety valves of net imports and the labor market, are putting substantial pressure on the total system.  What is remarkable at this stage is not that inflat ionary forces are picking up.  It is that there is so little evidence of a pickup.  I think, for example, that the acceleration in wages is unambiguous.  The one statistic nobody has menti oned today is the fact that average hourly earnings, adjusted for the industry mix that BL S publishes, is up 0.55 percent in April. That  84increase is far greater than even the ECI is  suggesting.  The average hourly earnings number has not been a particularly good estimator of the ECI, but it is an indication that the bias is clearly on the up side.  Nonetheless, when we look through the configura tion of unit costs, the estimate we end up with is that unit costs have fallen over the last six months for nonfinancial corporations, indeed for nonfarm bus iness generally.  If th is is indeed the ca se, all of the price acceleration we have seen reflects widening profit margins.  This is not an indication of the beginning of a major acceleration in prices.  Inde ed, the core PCE deflator for April rose less than 0.1 percent.  And over the 4-month period from January through April, when most of the inflation is showing up in the CP I, the average rate is 0.17 percen t monthly or an annual rate of approximately 2 percent.  While that rate is  higher than it was earlie r, there is no evidence at this stage that we are expe riencing a real underlying deterior ation in inflation of the kind that we typically have seen in the past.  I think we are in a quite different environment than we have seen in the past.  In such an environment real long-term interest rates ha ve to rise, and indeed they have risen very significantly in the last severa l weeks.  Real long-term BBB ra tes are up over 50 basis points after gradually edging higher for quite some peri od of time.  This indi cates that the markets are adjusting rapidly to the ev idence that overall demand fo rces are becoming very strong, driven in large part by the supply factors themselves.   I mentioned, I think late last year, that I was concerned about our tendency to get caught up in statistical acrophobia and feel the need to make our forecasts converge to the mean because that is basically what happens in our models.  I think we all have a tendency to do that.  I myself think that we will see some  slowing in the macroeconomic data that we usually look at, in part because our seasonal ad justments are inadequate.  That is, it is very  85difficult to seasonally adjust fo r the type of global warming a nd related rise in degree-days that we experienced during the winter months without some impact on the GDP figures.  So, it is perfectly conceivable that the GDP growth numbers for the fourth and first quarters were just an exaggeration.  They will slow down in the second quarter, even though no slowdown or in fact major changes may have occurred.  I think what we have is still the beginning, or perhaps we are well into it at this stage, of a significant long-term change in the behavior of the economy.  This is not to say that we don't ha ve a cyclical element involved in these growth numbers nor does it mean that higher interest rate s, especially real long- term rates, are having no effect.  Indeed, the evidence is now beginning  to show that the alleged absence of any effect from what we have done to date, or mo re importantly what the markets have done to date, is a false notion.   As Governor Ferguson pointed out, we ha ve seen a very dramatic shift in the borrowing of the business sector.  Net issuance at the long end has co me down, and the total of business loans plus commercial paper has sudden ly surged.  What that means is that a very large number of business firms are moving out of  the long end of the borrowing market to the short end. The reason is not that they are going to get signific antly lower interest rates, because they are not, but that they expect the su rge in interest rates to be temporary and they will be able to refinance their re cent borrowings at lower long-term rates in the future.  This is the classic way in which officers of corporate and financial firms behave.  As soon as they perceive that interest rates are not coming do wn, they will begin to  adjust their capital expenditure projections.  This  process has the effect of producing a gradual slowing.   We are seeing some evidence that housing starts are slowing, but the evidence is really marginal.  We are getting the same type  of responses that Mike  Moskow got from the  86motor vehicle manufacturers, which suggest th at these two sectors of the economy are not doing all that outstandingly well in  May.  Activity is still high in both, but it has come off its recent peaks to a considerable degree.  The probl em that we have with interest-sensitive areas of the economy is that if overall economic activ ity is accelerating, then what interest rates do is to alter the relative shares of expenditures.  And, indee d, if motor vehicles and housing are flattening out while the economy is rising rapidl y, interest rates ar e doing what one would expect them to do.  Responses are under way, an d as far as I can see our policy moves have tracked the long end of the market very well.  If we move 50 basis points today, we will continue to track it very well, and I think that is what we want  to try to do, namely try to maintain a policy that is consistent with the wa y market forces in the long end of the market are going.  I cannot say that I w ould personally envisage that th e inflation pressures are about to ease quickly.  But Jerry Jordan is not wr ong.  I remember 1994 exceptionally well.  At one point we decided to sit still while the markets we re driving forward.  We chose not to continue to move and I think correctly.  Now, that doesn't  mean we will always be correct.  It may be that we were lucky, and if it was luck, the next time we may lose. I believe the risks in moving 50 basis points today are not very large because I think the underlying momentum in the economy remains very strong.  What is going to happen in the future is probably going to be dependent on a number of deve lopments that we can't really forecast.  One is crude oil prices.  Those prices were declining when Mike and his colleagues started to put the Greenbook together.  One of  the reasons was a surprising slowdown in domestic demand for oil.  It essentially showed up in the form of a significant slippage in the demand for residual fuel oil in the first quart er stemming from a major shift throughout the world toward natural gas.  I think the sli ppage amounted to 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day.   87In Germany there also was a major shift into lig hter distillates.  Overall domestic demand in the first quarter actually was up only marginally over a year earlier.  Demand was stronger in United States is concerned, the prospects of ri sing inflation pressures stemming from oil may be over, and I say "may" because one cannot rule  out a big spike.  The reason relates to the very large retail marketing margins in gasoline.   These occurred as a consequence of the sharp increase in crude oil prices earlier, which follo wed a dramatic decline in crude inventories. The jump in crude oil prices pus hed up retail gasoline prices at one point, as I recall, some 10 to 15 cents a gallon above where a historically  average margin would have suggested they should be.  Those margins have eased back down, but they are still, I believe, something like 8 to 10 cents a gallon above average gasoline marke ting margins in the United States.  So even if we have some pickup in crude prices, the marg ins may still fall back to earlier norms, and it strikes me that the upside pre ssure on gasoline prices may no longer be there.  The same is true for home heating oil.  Obvious ly, if there is a big spike in cr ude, all bets are off, and that could create some fairly significant problems for the economic forecast. The crucial issue here is what will ha ppen to domestic demand and whether the financial markets will readjust themselves to higher interest rates and ultimately exert a retarding influence on consump tion expenditures, housing, and th e stock market.  If those forces are essentially in place, as I believe th ey are, we could end up with an economy that comes in at a level below the Greenbook forecast.   I think it is too soon to make that judgment.  It is conceivable that we will be more inclined to reach that conclusion in June, but I think it would be a mistake to do so now.   I believe our best bet at this st age is to follow the long end of the market as we have been  88doing, and that implies 50 basis points as far as  I can see.  Because there is as yet no compelling evidence that inflationary pressures are easing, I believe it would be a mistake not to stay asymmetric and our pre ss release should reflect such a d ecision.  That is all I have to say.  Would anybody like to comment?  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH .  Mr. Chairman, I support your conclusion.  Let me address myself to the concern about "sw eaty palms."  We have to remember that the mission that we have been given by the Americ an people is to provide a monetary policy appropriate for sustainable economic growth through price stability.  The demand in the economy is simply not sustainable.  It has wors ened significantly since our last meeting and, therefore, it seems to me absolu tely essential that we pick up the pace of tightening.  That in no way leads me to believe that we are going to  end up at 7, 7-1/4, or 7-1/2 percent on the funds rate.  I don't have any idea where we are going to end our tightening.  And I think we have to be very cautious and make these judgmen ts very carefully so that we don't overdo the tightening.  That’s especially the case given my concern, whic h I expressed earlier, that we have such a state of euphoria among the general public in the United States that it could be subject to a rather rapid and quick change.  In that circumstance th e likelihood of overdoing it on the tightening side is something we have to keep very much in mind.   But for today if we did not do 50 basis poi nts with the balance of risks language indicating a greater concern for in flation, I think we would just f eed the euphoria that I believe at the present time is rather dangerous.  That would be very inappropria te to do.  So, I think we are not in the "sweaty hands" period but in the "cool heads" pe riod, and I believe this is the right action to take.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.  89

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, everything you said convinced me that a 1/4 point seems right.  Inflation is not taki ng off and in fact a lot of the evidence suggests some easing off in the expansion.  Moreover, I don't think we shoul d be validating the market  necessarily.  I think we should be looking at what is in front of us, and 1/4 point with asymmetric language seems most appropriate.  A year ago when we were at 4-3/4 percent on the funds rate, there was a better case for moving more aggressively in the sense that  we had put in a lot of stimulus.  And yet we were very cautious in moving up.  It seems to me that we have been on a pretty good track in our policy actions and if I had my preference, I woul d stay on that track.  I'll put that view on the table for consideration. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  I strongly support your reco mmendation, Mr. Chairman.  I think all of the right arguments have already been made.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Mr. Chairman, I support your  recommendation.  I'd also like to speak to the issue that Tom Hoenig raised.  I think we want to be careful not to confuse gradualism and predictability.  While the goal of predictability is extremely important, we can't always make policy predictabl e.  Sometimes we are going to have to surprise the market.  But I think it is extremely helpful when we ar e able to have the markets very much on the same wavelength as we are.  An increase of 25 ba sis points, after all, has been in the market for quite some time.  The extra 25 basis points, if we in fact opt for 50 basis points today, has only been in the market since the ECI release.  So, all the most recent reports reflect a policy assumption in the marketplace that includes the 25 basis points that we are putting in place  90today, and then we are saying we should put in some more because the market believes that additional restraint is necessary.   News from this meeting will consist of th ree pieces.  One piece is the funds rate, and we are matching what the market expects, so it's not really news.  The second is the balance of risks language and, given what is in the fed funds futures market, I think we will be matching what the market anticipates.  The main news out of this meeting will be the statement that accompanies our policy announcement.  To my taste, it is going to be important that our message somehow says that, given wh at we know today, we believe that rates are going to have to continue to rise.  I don't know  how far that process is going to have to go, whether it's more or less than what the Greenbook forecasts.  And as Jerry Jordan rightly emphasizes, it will be very important that we not  go too far.  But in terms of what we know now, I don't think we want to give the impression that we see the end of this process.  Some people may read the 50 basis points, despite what  is in the federal funds futures market, as saying that we believe we are a bout at the end of our tightening.  In my view, that would be a mistake since I don't think that's what the evidence suggests today. I would also like to comment briefly on th e vulnerability of the stock market.  I think we all know that the stock ma rket is still very elevated by  historical standards and that the volatility in the market is really unpreced ented.  The NASDAQ has been more volatile this year than in the entire history of  the index.  The market is shaky.  It is not going to help us if the market cracks.  That would cause us a lot of trouble.  I don't mean ju st political trouble; I mean trouble in carrying forward a monetary po licy that does what we need it to do.  So, I think having a policy that is we ll in line with what the mark et expects, while it certainly provides no guarantee, runs much less of a risk th an if we surprise the market in a major way.  91

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support both halves of your recommendation.  Let me take just one minute to  explain why.  I think we are in the business here of trying to find a mini-max solution, if  you will, to minimize the maximum regret we will have in terms of the eff ects of our actions on society a nd the economy.  One way to do that is to support the market when the market is sending us clear signals .  As I said in my earlier remarks, long-term infla tion expectations have not gone up.  I think the reason is that the market is expecting us to react today in a way that is consistent with the way they are looking at the long term.  And we have in fact  worked very hard during this intermeeting period to make sure we are not looking in a mirror--that we are looking at the right data and that the market is as well.  Th is might not always be the case but at this stage the market is sending us a very clear signal that  the appropriate move is 50 ba sis points with a statement of continued concern about inflation ri sks.  To me the wisest course is to follow that signal.  I think, as you pointed out clearly, that real long-term interest ra tes have to go up.  In my view we would be in dangerous territ ory if we did not in fact s upport that, because otherwise we would be anchoring rates in a way that is incons istent with where we really want to go.   I strongly support what President Jordan and President Poole said because I, too, am not sure how far this tightening process is  going to go.  But, fortunately, we are in a position where we only have to make decisions  one meeting at a time.  And for today's meeting I think 50 basis points and a balance of risks statement tilted toward inflation is the right policy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich.  92

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I support both parts of  your recommendation as well, Mr. Chairman.  I think we have to get rates hi gher and that aggregate demand and aggregate supply are just not balanced.  There is still tremendous momentum on the up side and I think the balance of risks is still on that side.  I do believe that at some point, perhaps not far from now, that Jerry Jordan will be right and the ri sks will begin to tip toward our overshooting.  But if we have to respond to that, we can.  For right now, I don't see it.  I still think we have to go 50 basis points, with asymmetric language.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry. MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, it seems clear to me that we need to tighten policy further at this meeting, and I enthusiasti cally support your recommendation for a 50 basis point increase.  I also believe  that the balance of  risks remains weighted toward higher inflation, and incorporating that view in the pre ss release is for me an important part of the recommendation as well. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I strongly support your recommendation for a 50 basis point increase an d for a balance of risk s sentence tilted toward higher inflation.  I recognize that there is some  uncertainty about how far we will need to go and I personally think we are going to have to do more. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus. MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, I s upport your recommendation and I do so enthusiastically.  I would simply add the point th at if in fact inflati on expectations are now rising, this move of 50 ba sis points is really not that much more aggressive than the moves we have been taking up to this point. While some  differences of opinion have been expressed  93around the table about whether infl ation expectations are indeed rising, I think there is some evidence that that is the case.  So, I support both parts of your recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan. MR. JORDAN.  I fully support the 50 basi s point move at this meeting.  My preference would be to say that with such a move the risks are balanced.  But I recognize the risk that such a statement woul d be misinterpreted, a nd that would be undesi rable in my view.  But to my mind saying that the balance of risks is still tilted toward inflation also can be misinterpreted if the market's impression is that  the decision at the June  meeting is a foregone conclusion.  I think that would be a mistake and it would be miscommunicating.  I'm troubled by the concern over surprising the market because  we do have to disappoint the market at times by not doing what it expects.  We know th at; we've done it many times before.  I prefer to think of this as a situation where sometimes we will have to take an action and communicate in a way to educate the markets and get them to adjust to us rather than have us adjusting to the market.  So, at least among us, if  we are going to say that the balance of risks is tilted toward inflation and th at the funds rate will be moved still higher, I wouldn't want to think about that in terms of the old tilt language .  That is, I don’t want  the presumption to be that we are going to come back predisposed to another increase in June.  I think it would be desirable to take a stronger ac tion at some time and then be willing to give it more time to have the desired effects. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  First Vice President Stone. MR. STONE.   Mr. Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation.  I think a larger action by the Committee today will forestall any rise in longer-term  94expectations of inflation.  And in my view, not moving th e funds rate up 50 basis points probably would lead to long-term  expectations of some increa se in inflation.       

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Mr. Chairman, I support your  recommendation.  I do have to admit that I got to this decision by a rather different route than you did, but it is nevertheless good to end up with the same conclusion.  I am concerne d that our challenge is much more demanding than slowing the expansion to trend.  The furthe r increase in utiliza tion rates and signs of building inflation pressures suggest that we ar e ultimately going to have to slow economic growth to below trend for a while.  And until this process is much further along, there's a threat of continued upward pressure on inflati on.  I think the gradua l approach we've been taking so far has been motivated by the possibility that our task might be a more limited one--just slowing the economy to trend--and also by th e fact that until recently there hasn't been any sign of rising inflation.  Moreover, we’ve ha d concerns or uncertain ties about sustainable utilization rates.  But I think it has always b een clear that there were risks in the gradual approach.  And the risks were that during the ti me we were trying to slow the expansion, the imbalance between actual and potential output would become st ill worse and the threat of inflation would become more of a reality. It seems to me that with a more aggre ssive policy action of 50 basis points today the risk of a policy mistake is much smaller than  with a more gradual po licy response.  What we're doing in some sense today is moving forwar d a rate increase that in any event we likely would have implemented in the near term.  S o, we don't have to have any larger cumulative increase in interest rates than we otherwise would have had, but we put ourselves in a position to implement a larger cumulative rise if  it turns out to be justified.  Thank you.  95

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY.  I support your recommenda tion, Mr. Chairman, for all of the reasons that have been stated around the table. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  I, too, support your reco mmendation.  I think we may be seeing some incipient signs of slowing in the economy but I don't think it's enough.  Our own forecast and the Greenbook forecast say that the slowing will not be enough.  Also, I see the 50 basis point move, while differe nt from the moves we have been making, as consistent with them.  We have reached a point in time when  that is an appropriate action because of developments in the market.  I disagree a little  with President Poole on the volatility and the downward trends that we've seen in the mark et.  The fact is that other things have demonstrably not fallen out of bed at the same  time--maybe they will down the road--but I don't get a sense that the volatility and market downturns are having a major impact in a real sense on the economy.  So, I think we have some opportunity to act without fear of unsettling the market, whereas earlier I was in favor of a gradual approach to tightening because of concerns about the market and ma rket volatility.  Now that we'v e seen a bit of that and bad things haven't happened, we have a window of  opportunity during which we can move the funds rate up and send a consistent message that the risks are still on the up side.   I think we should limit our statement to th e usual language as much as we possibly can, saying that the risks are tilt ed toward inflation in the fo reseeable future, and not give anybody room to play with the inte rpretation of what we meant by this word or that word.  I’d continue with a consistent approach toward tightening monetary conditions and be always watchful for signs of incipient slowing.  96

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'm fully comfortable with your recommendation in all its aspects and I share the thinking that real inte rest rates should be going up from here.  Let me just add one othe r thought, which is that I assume we will be open-minded about where we are going to go next  and at what pace.  One reason I think we want to maintain that stance is the point I allu ded to earlier, namely my own uncertainty about the inflation outlook.  I'm not persuaded, especi ally with this action, that we're going to confront a significant acceleration of inflation.  I say that in pa rt because we in Minneapolis have been looking for the effects of labor ma rket tightness and its correlation to future inflation--not only in the last several years but  we've taken this back empirically for quite some time, and we can't find evidence since about 1984 that labor mark et variables make a significant contribution to forecasting inflati on.  I'm not entirely sure what we ought to conclude from that, but one thi ng we certainly ought to conclude  is that we should be cautious as we think about what has happened in the economy and its implications for the future.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, we can revise our method of estimating and reporting it to a monthly basis!  The majority ap pears to be in favor of  50 basis points with the balance of risks sentence toward  inflationary pressures.  W ould you read the directive that would capture that?  97

To further its long-run obj ectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 6-1/2 percent" The "balance of risks" sentence would be as follows:  "Against the background of its long-run goals of price stab ility and sustainable economic gr owth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened infl ation pressures in the foreseeable future."
