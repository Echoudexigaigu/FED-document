CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good morning, ev eryone.  We begin with Peter Fisher.

MR. FISHER.  Thank you Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the package of charts with a peach cover.1  On the first page, as usua l, is a chart depicting the forward rates. You will note on the far right of each of the three panels that the recent spike in the current 3-month LIBOR ra tes, the black line, occurred as their maturities moved into the period that c overs the calendar year-end.  I don't draw any other significance to that spike.         The red lines on the top panels depi ct U.S. forward rates. As you can see there, since the September 1st rele ase of the August employmen t report, both the 6-month and 9-month forward 3-month rates have been driven below the current 3-month LIBOR rate and the 3-month forward 3-month ra te.  More recently, the 6- and       9-month forward rates have traded down to within less than 10 basis points of the Committee’s current fed funds target rate.      Summarized differently, 3-month rate s in the second and th ird quarters of next year are now expected to be below current rates and below those in next year’s first quarter as well.  It’s hard to resist the conclusion that markets are pricing in expectations that the Committee’s next move  will be an easing.  But there are very few market participants who will say so in  words, let alone date it, though they are actually predicting it in their pricing behavior.  So, while we see it in the prices, it’s a funny kind of reflection of group behavior  to which few are willing to confess.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Some one will think of a phrase to describe it, like “money speaks louder than words.”       MR. FISHER.  Yes, that comes to  mind.  I think your former colleague, Wayne Angell, well summarized this  curious state of affairs,  at least to my way of thinking.  When recently asked what the Committee’s next move would be, he responded that it would occur in the year 2003.  [Laughter]        Turning to the middle panel, as you can see, the euro forward rates declined a bit after the ECB raised rates on August 31st but moved down principally on rose again a little but then  declined throughout September as evidence seemed to accumulate that euro area growth was sl owing and may have hit a near-term peak earlier in the summer.  Japanese forward rates, as the green lines in the bottom panel indicate, have become a little noisier as calendar and fiscal year-end dates                                                            1 A copy of the charts used by Mr. Fisher is appended to this transcript.  (Appendix 1)   4have traded into the forward rate matu rities, but the overall levels are little changed.   On the next page I have shown some  long-term rates.  The top panel shows U.S. Treasury yields on 2-year , 10-year, and 30-year securities and the bottom panel has the U.S. and euro sw ap rates for those same maturities.  In the top panel you can see that from August 31st through last Friday, the latest date depicted there, 2-year Tr easury yields declined by about 18 basis points.  Those expecting a slowdown in economic activity have eagerly cited this as evidence supporting th at outlook.  Both 10- and 30-year Treasury yields backed up, with 30-year  yields trading a bove 10-year yields for the first time since January, and th is has been eagerly cited by those who have been concerned about inflation risks.  Now, I don’t want to downplay concerns about inflation, which are wi dely being discussed in the market, particularly with reference to the volat ility in oil prices.  But the modest backup in yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries did appe ar to coincide with a heavy pace of new corporate issuan ce and with indications from the campaign trail and the Congress that bot h major political parties might yet find a way to spend some of the surplus.  Moreover, in the top part of the bottom panel, you can see that swap rates show a slightly different and less pronounced trajectory.  The 2-year swap rate, like the 2-year Treasury yi eld, fell by 18 basis points from August 31st through last Friday.  But the 10-year  swap rate fell 8 basis points while the 30-year swap rate was unchanged.  At the bottom of the page you can see that euro swap rates, at lower levels, roughly tracked the movements in U.S. 10- and 30-year swaps, with the 2-year euro declining 17 basis poin ts and the 10-year declining 5 basis points.  But the 30-year euro swap b acked up by 11 basis points.  Thus, both the dollar and the euro 2- to 30-year  swap curves steepened by 19 basis points from August 31st through last Friday.  But on the dollar side, all of the widening occurred by falling 2-year rate s, while on the euro side it was divided between a fall in the 2-year rate  and a rise in the 30-year rate.    These relative movements in U.S. and euro area swap curves not only reflect but reinforce the perception that while growth in the United States may be slowing--with the risk of an uptick of inflation, perhaps from oil prices among other things--that in Europe is slowing also.  And the slowdown in Europe is from lower le vels of growth, while the uptick in inflation could perhaps be of a greater  magnitude from the combination of rising oil prices and the falling euro.  Turning to the next page and directly  to exchange rates, you can see in the top panel the percent change since May 1st in the three major currency pairs.  The bottom panel depicts implied volatilities of one-month options  5for those same pairs.  We should rec ognize, of course, that the dollar has been strong against a number of curr encies for some time.  But over the course of the summer and into Septem ber, among the three major currencies I think we clearly have a problem of a weak and volatile euro, particularly against the yen.  The red line showing the euro/yen rate leads the way lower in the top panel, as the spot rate has traded dow n, and the way higher in implied volatility in the bottom panel.   The dollar/yen line, in blue, is remarkably stable across the top panel, with declining implied volatility in September.    Why did the euro come under such pre ssure in September?  I see three reasons that work together.  First, in anticipation of the Ja panese fiscal half-year-end statement date on September 30th, Japanese investors were seeking to reduce or hedge their euro exposures.  Second, in a market with this ready class of euro sellers, there were some  very confused policy signals sent by the Europeans.  On September 5th Chancellor Schroede r in a prepared speech said that the current euro/dollar exchange rate is more of a reason to be happy than concerned.  The ensuing cacophony of official utterances drew attention to the lack of a clear  voice on euro exchange rate policy and made the euro’s exchange rate an increasingly political issue.  The third factor was the ECB’s mistake, in my  view, of announcing on September 14th that it would sell accumulated interest  on its foreign exchange reserves, amounting to 2.5 billion euros, and that in the future it would consistently sell interest income.  I want to be clea r that I don’t think that’s a mistake in principle; in principle that ’s a fine thing for a central bank to do.  But timing is everything.  I’m confident that the ECB thought that with this device they could intervene a little w ithout exposing themselves to  the credibility loss of an actual intervention.  From my way of thinking, by taking an insufficient amount of funds to make a difference in the market, they sent a muted and garbled signal of a “noni ntervention” intervention .  And they created the risk of inducing more euro sellers to come into the market by announcing their intention to buy.  Why did we join the inte rvention on Friday the 22nd?  The short answer is                                                                       virtually every important condition that we spelled out.  At the start of that week,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          was informed Thursday evening, while the                                                                        details of the agreement were           wor                           being               ked out, that Secr etary Summers would state on Friday after the operation that U.S. foreign exchange policy remained unchanged and that a strong dollar is in our natio nal interest.         Turning to the operation itself, you can see in the bottom portion of this last through last Friday.  I’d like to make three points about th e joint intervention operation.  Sadly, the operation appears, at least to my cynical eyes, to have been anticipated by some in the market.  From Wednesday’s close to Thursday’s close, the euro rose more than a cent, and it ro se another cent from Thursday’s close to 7  7a.m. Friday, just before we entered th e market.  While it is often said that intervention works best when it’s pushing the market in the direction it already wants to go, this isn’t quite  what we mean by that.         Second, even so, I think the operation should be recognized as having been fairly successful in a narrow technical se nse.  The rate closed on Friday the 22nd at .8784, higher than the prior day’s close and higher than the rates when we entered the market.  At the close of the following week, Friday the 29th, rates were higher than when we entered the market on the preceding Friday.  We can have bigger movements than these, but I don’t think it’ s reasonable to expect much more of intervention than a one-day or one-week impact, particul arly in the absence of a subsequent concrete policy action to which the intervention can be thought of as a bridge.          Third, I think the impact on expe ctations about the Committee’s future actions and U.S. exchange rate policy was quite  limited.  During the operation the dollar rose against the yen, as you can see in th e exchange rate data  on the bottom line of the page.  While the December fed funds fu tures contract came off about 1-1/2 basis points on Friday the 22nd, most people in the market attr ibuted this tiny bit of noise to the weakness in U.S. equities that day and the previous day rather than to the intervention.           Mr. Chairman, for the first tim e since 1998 I will need a vote of the Committee to ratify the System’s foreign exchange ope rations.  In those operations we sold 669,723,900 U.S. dollars and purchased 750 million euros as the System’s share of the U.S. portion of the September 22nd intervention.         In domestic operations, the fed funds rate has been quite well behaved since your last meeting.  We have redeemed $4.8 billion in Treasuries at auctions under our internal limits and have purchased  $6.1 billion in Treasuries in outright operations since your last meeting.  I s hould note that the currency component of M1 has been weaker than we had expected. This reflects both weaker domestic demand and continued net inflows of forei gn currency from abroad.  Our detailed extended forecast of reserves is availabl e on our Market Source web site.  I will need a separate vote of the Committee to ratify our domestic operations.       I’d be happy to answer any questions.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  How much money di d the American taxpayer lose by our buying 750 million euros at a higher price than we w ould have had there not been front-running?

MR. FISHER.  I haven’t made that calculati on, but I’m sure we could do it in just a few minutes; it could be done off of the rates I have provided here.  8

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s at  least a couple of percent. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Yes, it’s a couple of percent. MR. KOS.  It’s about 15 to 30 million dollars. MR. FISHER.  Dino gave you the answer: It’s about 15 to 30 million dollars. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We should complain  and ask for restitution!  My second question relates to the exhibit on swap  rates and other yields.  You indi cated with regard to the rather significant closing of the spreads in  30-year swaps versus Treasuries that the calendar was a factor.  But if the private calendar were an element in that, we would have s een more than a modest rise in the swap rates.  The presumption that there is no credit improveme nt involved almost leads one to conclude that what we’r e looking at is the potential demise of the 30-year Treasury issue.  The probability of that demise has gone down quite significantly for the reasons you suggested--about everyone in the political arena wants to  spend part of the surplus.  I agree to half that phrase.  The political campaign has weeks to go and the presumption that ther e will be any surplus left is questionable!  Why can’t we say that  virtually all of that closing in the spreads is attributable to the expectation of running out of U.S. Treasury secu rities?  It’s a supply problem, but the problem obviously is the issue of a greate r potential supply of U.S. Treas uries rather than the private calendar.  Would that be an accurate way of looking at it? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don’t disagree with the way you’ve described it, Mr. Chairman.  But it’s a very small data sample of only a few weeks.  A nd I think in the microcosm of a couple of weeks, the heavy pace of private corporate offerings helped to move those rates up to their peak.  A number of investors looked at the pickup in  yield from a move out of a 30-ye ar Treasury into a 5-year private debt issue, and that opportunity cost looked very attractive to them.  I’m not disagreeing with you that when we look back, whatever the trend line is here, probably the supply consideration will be  9more significant, but in this microcosm I offered bot h developments as factors in the bit of noise we were seeing here. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’m just raising th e point that one certainly can explain the firming of a 30-year swap rate in those terms.  Bu t the presumption that the fairly significant decline in the spreads is attributable to anything other than the potenti al long-term supply of 30-year Treasuries I find somewhat less co nvincing.  Am I wrong in that? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I would agree with you on wher e to put the most weight.  But I would want you not to put zero weight on this different issue--and maybe I should have been more explicit about it--that there will be a pr ocess of investors coming out of th e long end of the Treasury market at lower and lower yields.  Even if the supply of Treasuries comes back from the dire forecast people have made of no 30-year issues outstanding, these yiel d levels relative to what  is available elsewhere suggest that investors will be draw n to the higher-yielding instruments.   I just urge you not to put a zero weight on that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, I had no inten tion of doing that.  I never put zero weight on anything!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH .  Or 100 percent! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Or 100.  Further qu estions for Peter?  President Parry.   

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Peter, my recollection of previ ous interventions--let’s say going back 10 or 12 years--is that we would be approached by the Treasury which, of course, was receiving a lot of pressure from another country, and we would act at the request of th e Treasury.  It sounds as if the dynamics were a little different this time becau se you emphasized your discussion with the ECB and                               discussion with the Chairman.  Did you just leave out a pa rt or was it different?  10

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I don’t think it was qualitatively  different from operations of the early 1990s in the sense that there usually have been  two channels of communication with the United States.  In those days, it wa s between the Bundesbank and both  the Federal Reserve and the Treasury.  Those two channels opera te concurrently.  The Treasury was and remains in the driver’s seat, as we say.  

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  And that was the case this time? MR. FISHER.  That was the case this time. MR. PARRY.  That wasn’t clear to me.  Thank you. MR. FISHER.  I’m sorry, I meant that to be explicit.  There is a novel awkwardness with the ECB in that, as Secretary Summers has said, th ere is no one to answer his phone call--there is no one place where he can call his counterpart--whereas there is someone to answer our phone call.  So there was some awkwardness.  And there’s still an intramural dis pute on the Continent as to who’s on first in that regard.  This made the process co nsiderably more awkward and cumbersome for both the United States Treasury and for us. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You know the Treas ury, to its credit, feels uncomfortable dealing directly with another central bank ex cept through us.  And I think in that regard-- 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  So there’s an in stitutional change that has re ally produced the different approach. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s largely that. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  It’s  an institutional difference. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.   Right.  11

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  The Federal Reserve repres ents both itself and the Treasury of the United States whereas the ECB doe s not represent the treasuries of its member countries but is just  the central bank. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Good.  I thi nk that explains it. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I’m sorry I wasn’t clear about that. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Mr. Chairman, I’d like to take  a couple of minutes to talk about the intervention issue because I think it ’s a very important issue for us .  If I were currently a voting member of the FOMC, I would offer an amendment to the motion to ratify the recent transaction in euros for System account.  My purpose would not in any way be to express c oncern over the actions of the Account Manager, but to reduce the probabili ty of future interventions for System account.  The amendment, and I don’t have exact wording, woul d require that any future intervention be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion at it s most recent meeting and that the Chairman should, if feasible, consult with the FOMC before authorizing addi tional transactions in foreign currencies.  I take this position because I believe that the recent exchange market intervention is a very serious issue for the Federal Reserve.  The in tervention has not to date created problems, but it probably will in the future.  Going down this road  is likely to be costly to the United States. The decision to participate in  the European effort to support the euro was made by the U.S. Treasury and not by the Federal Reserve.  Ho wever, we have lent ou r prestige and blessing to the intervention by particip ating, not just as an agent for the Treasury, but for our own account.  Moreover, the intervention was widely reported as an intervention by the ce ntral banks involved.  I believe that the intervention was unwise and did not serve the interests of th e United States, nor of Europe for that matter.  But our re sponsibility is to the United Stat es and we ought to make the best judgments we can in that regard.  If the U.S.  Treasury has a different judgment, then it should  12intervene for its account.  We can act as agent fo r the Treasury, but I believe  we have an obligation not to intervene for the Federal Reserve account if in our judgment  the intervention is unwise.   The problem with intervention in the foreign ex change market is that a dynamic is created that almost invariably has caused difficulty in the past.  I believe that we face a high probability of the same process occurring in th is case.  Economists are agreed that sterilized intervention is unlikely to have any long-term effect.  If there is a problem with policy fundamentals, then those fundamentals must be changed to achieve any lasting change in the value of a currency in the foreign exchange market.   Based on extensive study and experience with  exchange market intervention, economists have developed an overwhelming consensus that an  exchange rate system should be either freely floating or thoroughly fixed through a currency union or a currency board.  The halfway house of intervention is unstable and unsatis factory.  I know of no documented case in which an intervention episode from the beginning of a series of interventi ons to the end turned out well.  I know of lots of cases that turned out badly.  I’ve studied in considerable detail the intervention dynamic that began with the Plaza Agreement in Sept ember 1985 and lasted for several years. The conclusion from that analysis is that the Plaza intervention and its af termath were costly for the United States and for Japan and the United Kingdom as well.  Interven tion during the 1980s and the early 1990s that attempted to maintain the European exchange rate  mechanism did not work well.  I could multiply these examples many times over.   Intervention creates a political and economic dynamic that  with high probability creates further problems.  The dynamic ahead of us is that further instability is likely, whether the euro sinks again or recovers.  If the euro sinks, calls fo r additional intervention are inevitable.  And the European central bank, having starte d down this road, will find it ve ry difficult not to continue.   13Should the euro rise significantly, there will be ca lls to intervene in the other direction before an excessively strong euro damages Eu ropean exports and the European economic recovery.  In either case, we’ll be asked to participate in these interventions.  Only if we  are lucky and the euro settles in the neighborhood of its current le vel for many months do we have a chance that the dynamic of intervention will gradually fade, making further interventions unlikely. Federal Reserve policy should not depend on our bei ng lucky.  If euro fl uctuations lead to a European judgment for additiona l intervention, so be it.  But th e Federal Reserve should, in my view, make clear that this centr al bank does not believe that in tervention for the Federal Reserve account is wise and that, therefore,  we do not intend to join in any future intervention operations.  We can make that point clear to our European friends and to the U.S. Treasury without advertising our position publicly.   I do not accept the argument that the United States, including the Federal Reserve, is simply passively supporting our friends in Europe.  The United States and Europe are now in the intervention business together.  I believe it imperativ e that the Federal Reserv e lead in reestablishing a U.S. policy of nonintervention in the foreign exchange market.   The Federal Reserve is in a very difficult pos ition on this matter.  If the Federal Reserve rather than the Treasury had the legal responsibility to make these decisions for the United States, then I do not believe that the FOMC would have b een out front urging interv ention.  This Committee might or might not have cooperated when the ECB asked us to intervene for the Federal Reserve account.  I hope the Committee’s response would have been a polite “no.”  But now we have lent our prestige and accepted a degree of the responsibility fo r the outcome of this process that has started, while deferring to the Treasury on the decision to support the ECB’s intervention decision.  If this Committee is opposed to the intervention on its merits, as  I believe it should be, then we need to find  14a way to extract ourselves from supporting intervention with our pr estige and our resources.  We should not permit ourselves to be in a position wh ere we are accountable but have ceded authority over the intervention decision to the Treasury.  That is why I believe that the Federal Reserve should make clear to the Treasury that the System will not share in any future interventions without the express authorization of this Committee. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me comment.  Fi rst of all, you left out in your analysis of sterilized intervention the most  extraordinary set of experiment s proving it doesn’t work, which is the Japanese experience employing $20 billion against the dollar wi th zero effect.  There is no evidence, nor does anybody here beli eve that there is any evidence,  to confirm that sterilized intervention does anything.  We don’t believe it.  The Treasury doesn’t believe it.  The Europeans do, but that’s another question.   When is the last time we intervened? MR. FISHER.  June of 1998. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Between June of 1998 and today--or I should say last week--we probably had 20 or so diffe rent requests, at va rious levels, for intervention.  We turned them all down.  And indeed, in this  latest case we were not happy with the notion of intervening.  What occurred essentially was that the Treasury, f eeling under very considerable pressure from the rest of the G-7, concluded that in the spirit of international comity we had very little choice but to accommodate the Europeans--                                     We, the Federal Reserve, did have the choice of saying we would not participate.  The presumption that we could do that w ithout it being known is not believable.  We publish data on our interventi on activity and if we don’t participate with the Treasury, it becomes known.  Now, th at would create a schism within the United States government.  And the question we have to evaluate is whether our concerns about the inefficacy and potentially  15counterproductive effects of sterili zed intervention are far more si gnificant than th e schism that would be created with the Treasury.  In my judgme nt the answer is no, for the same reason that we acquiesce in an awful lot of crazy economics that go on out there--not only in  the international realm among our trading partners, but within the rest of the U.S. government.  We do have to maintain a relationship with them.  We are i ndependent, to be sure, but not from  the Congress.  Indeed we are not.  So I think we have a very seriou s difficulty in making these tradeoffs.   I told                                 when we were talking about it in advance, that the thing we have to be concerned about is the probability that th is intervention will fail.  And a failure of the intervention as we go into the G-7 meeting would put extraordinary politi cal pressure on everybody to say something.  I said to him: If this fails, wi ll you support a statement that  says that Europe must address the fundamentals, which indeed are the ca use of the weakness in the euro?  And he said absolutely yes.  I can’t second-guess the Treasury  on this; they have been  very good over the last number of years and would proba bly not disagree with a word you said with respect to the evaluation of intervention.  I think what we have to do is to make judgments as to how important certain issues are.  I don’t deny that this is an impo rtant issue.  But I just do  not think, at the level at which we are intervening and the infrequency with  which we are doing it, th at it creates an ongoing problem for us.  Is it a negative?  I agree with you that it is.  Is it a significant negative?  I don’t think so.  Would I have preferred that we didn’t interv ene?  I certainly would.  Would we be strongly opposed to another intervention?  We told them we  would be.  They wanted to create some ongoing possibilities of interventi on over a period of days, and we said ab solutely not in terms of making any commitment.  We did not shut the door completely.  We said that in all cases intervention is a batch process.  We do them one at a time but in the cont ext of the conditions in each individual case.  And I would say that so far this Treas ury has been a lot less likely to cav e in to foreign pressures than  16previous ones.  And in view of that I believe they deserve our support even though we do it with, I think, some significant chagrin.  That’s my view, anyway.   

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  May I comment? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Sure. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I’ve been at the Reserve Federal for 8-½ years, having had Peter’s job and now the Vice Chairman ship of the Committee, and I think economic theory is wonderful and is extremely helpful in gu iding us in our judgments.  But in my time here, I have found that very occasionally one reaches the point, as the Chairman has just been suggesting, that we as central bankers have to make practical decisions, knowi ng that they are not consistent with the soundest possible economic theory.  This was one of those occasions.  Given that this was our first intervention since 1998 and one of the very few that we ha ve done over the course of many years, I think the members of this Committee shoul d have the confidence that the Chairman makes these decisions very rarely, and in my view very wi sely.  He is helped a great deal by the New York Desk.  I usually am actively involved and I am the person who is frequently called first because they know I usually say “no.”  And for some reason they  have decided that a “no” from me is less appalling than a “no” from the Chairman.  We are constantly telling others--                                     that interventions basically accomp lish nothing.  But there are very ra re occasions, and I think this was one of them, when the overall responsibility for the management of the world economy, which is something in which we are the major player but not the only player, requires us to respond favorably to a request for intervention.  But we do so on very arduous terms from the point of view of the requester.  This late st case involved a request that we in fact have been actively turning down for months.  But the situation had reached a point                                                                                                                                                                                                                          .  And in my  17judgment, the monetary authorities of the United St ates very reluctantly made the right decision to join in the intervention. When we are dealing with these situations we really don’t want to be in the position of requiring a Committee meeting to say no because we say no 99.9 percent of the time.  It would be extremely awkward for us to say, when we are in the middle of these rolling negotiations, that we have to tune out for X hours in order to have an  FOMC meeting.  With the track record of the Chairman and the amount of confidence that we ha ve in him, I think having the Chairman make the get to a certain level, the Committee’s standing pro cedural instructions provi de that the Chairman shall clear the proposed interven tion with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee--which currently consists of the Chairman, Governor Ferguson, G overnor Kelley, and me.  We are 100 percent in agreement with you on the theory, but pragmatic consid erations very, very occas ionally guide us to a different conclusion.   

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Mr. Chairman, if I may.  What I think we need is a standing position that we do not share 50/50 with the Treasur y in any intervention unless there is an explicit decision to do so.  It is very awkward to say no when we have a custom of sharing 50/50.  I understand that.  It is that custom that I would like to see us change.  And I think we have a context today that shows why we need to change that standing position. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Frankly, I se riously question whether it is worth fundamentally altering our relationship with the Tr easury over what is effectively a very minor change.  Remember that our money is really their m oney.  If there is such a thing as a shareholder of the Federal Reserve, it is the U.S. Treasury.  To the extent that we profit or lose in our foreign exchange operations, it nets out against our payment to the Treasury each year.  In that sense it’s  18always their money with which we are trading.  Whether we are splitting the intervention amounts 50/50 or 100/0, the net effect on Trea sury budget receipts, so to speak, is  invariant.  So  it is an act that essentially involves nonsubsta ntive accounting.  I don’t see what we avail doing that.  I think we do far better going out periodically as we do--we all do--saying that inte rvention doesn’t work. We’ve all said that publicly and I think that’s far more relevant than our going through the motion of not participating in the tr ansaction, of not doing 50 percent.  I think that creates more problems than it solves. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I have a couple of questions, but first I want to say th at I think we have a good chance of making a profit on this one.   Going back to the Chairman’s earlier questi on about how much did the taxpayers lose by our buying euros at the price we bought them, I assume that was in contrast to the price at which we could have bought them.  What exactly are the mechanics of determining the price? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  If I understand your question, it’s the price we get when we enter the question had to do with the set of numbers across the bottom of page 4 in my material.  Had the rate not traded up 2 cents, how much would-- 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The presum ption being there was front-running. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  The operation was front-runned or leaked--or at least th ere are all sorts of questions. 

[SECTION]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.                                             MR. FISHER.                                                                                                                                                                                     Little countries on the periphery of  the exchange rate system of our world economy can have active reserve managers.  I don’t think it works for a major currency or even a component of it in an NCB to have an aggressive reserve management program.  For your benefit, we at the Federal Reserve--as I’m sure you pretty much take for gr anted--do not adjust the currency composition of our foreign currency rese rves other than thr ough official acts of intervention.  It’s routine for ot her central banks around the world to  trade actively fo r profit in the exchange market and to hedge their reserve posi tions actively and dynamically.  Malaysia comes to mind in its operations a number of years ago.  When it’s a small country whose currency doesn’t play a particularly dramatic ro le in the world econo my, I think everyone knows how to deal with that.  When it’s a component of an institution that is one of the major central banks of the world, it really is very different.  The Ba nk of England, I want to be very clear, has a long tradition of being an active foreign currency trader in the open markets.  They’ve had some good and some bad experiences with that, and they’ve developed a centu ry-long tradition that lends  a note of distinction  20to that kind of trading operation.  I think that’s the exception that proves the rule ra ther than a good pattern for others to follow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Another question is on the defi nition of sterilizati on.  How do we know this intervention is sterilized on th eir part?  I take it the definition of unsterilized  intervention in this case would be that fewer euros and more dollars are created in the ne ar future than would otherwise have been created.  On our side, we are going to do what we are going to do without taking that intervention into consideration, but do we know that our counterparts at the ECB aren’t going to take some actions that would keep the inte rvention from being entirely sterilized? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well, we don’t know what they will decide at their Council meeting later this week with respect to their interest rate.  But ju st as we target an interest rate, they target an interest rate.  So I’ve taken it for granted, and I th ink the market has too, that they will be managing their repo operations just as we w ould.  And I believe there was some reflection of that in the market there. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  It is conceivable that their target for the inte rest rate will be different than it would have been had they not intervened, isn’t it? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  That will only come out of their Council meeting, ju st as it would only come from this Committee. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I understand that, but--  MR. FISHER.  It’s possible. MR. MCTEER.  I’m saying that we’re all talk ing as if this has been sterilized.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think you’re raising a slightly different issue.  The degree of open market operations required to  keep an interest rate constant , and hence the creation of, in our case dollars and in their case euros, can vary.  So it is not the same th ing as saying that if the interest  21rate target is unchanged, the result is full steril ization in the sense that  the actual open market operations offset the foreign exchange operations eu ro for euro.  As a practical matter it is very close, but it doesn’t have to be exact because they don’t endeavor to do a full sterilization in the sense that the asset side of their balance sheet is  literally unchanged and they  merely shift from one currency to the other.  They don’t do that.  What they  do is to target an inte rest rate.  Basically the net effect of that is almost exactly  as if they were to offset the exchange rate transactions euro for euro.  But it is not exactly that type of full sterilization.  Nor do es anybody do it that way.  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, for all of my  strident opposition to  intervention over the years, I recognize that in partic ular cases such as this one tough calls have to be made.  And we are in a difficult situation.  But I certainly want to  support the thrust of Bill Poole’s statement.  For me the problem has always been the damage that intervention and the prospe ct of intervention can do to the overall credibility of our longer-term pr ice stability objective.  To me that’s the key problem.  So I would support Bill an d in particular his suggestion th at at some point we consider trying to find a way in advance to commit ourselv es to disengaging from this activity.   While intervention may seem not to do great damage in a particular instance like this if it involves a relatively small amount of transactions, it still puts th e possibility on the table; it’s always out there.  So I really believe we need to try to find some institutional way to get around it permanently.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think we are doing that.  We are doing it, hopefully, by education.  I’ve had innumerable conversations with  our counterparts in the central banks of Japan and Europe arguing the inefficacy of this kind of operation.  A lot of us have.  I know Bill McDonough has done that and so have a lot of others.  And it has worked in part.  I believe there has been a very major change in the general view ab out the efficacy of intervention among the central  22bankers.  The problem is that fi nance ministers change with some  frequency.  We convince one and then he leaves office.  And his replacement starts tabula rasa.  And it is by no means self evident that a currency cannot be stopped from  moving merely by inte rvening.  There are lo ts of economists who believe that.  I won’t go through a list of our frie nds who do, but there are some fairly prominent economists out there who seriously believe that we can effectively implement sterilized intervention and make it work.  If one can’t convince them, then  it’s pretty tough to convince a political person whose background is somewhat marginal in this area.   But frankly, education is  the best way that I know of to solve this problem--in other words to  get less interest in in tervention as a possible solution.  And I would say that we’ve succeeded to a very large extent with the G-10 governors.  We have just not done all that well with the rotating G-7 or G-10 finance ministers.   

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  May I just make a quick fo llow-up comment?  To me it’s not the question of inefficacy or whether sterilized interv ention does or does not have an impact of some sort over the short run.  It’s a matter of our credibility and what it does to that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Supposing interven tion works and we use it.  What would that do to our credibility? 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Well, I think it raises quest ions about what our ultimate fundamental objective is. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Absolutely, but it has nothing to do with our credibility.  It 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I mean the credibility of a long-run strategy aimed fundamentally at longer-term price stability.  23

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But supposing people could argue that sterilized intervention actually enhanced an anti-inflationary postu re?  If that were factually so, we would affect our credibility by not interv ening.  It’s a factual issue; I don’ t think it’s a credibility issue. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Let me return  more to President Poole’s argument, and perhaps make a less subtle comment than the Ch airman just made.  If you really want us out present relationship with th e Treasury than we can without it.  The amount of influence that we have in international circles is enhanced by the role we play.  So it isn’t just Alan Greenspan, Bill McDonough, and others around the table giving our pet idea on some theor y, but rather that we also have power--and “clout” in the langu age of my native city--a nd that’s very important for us.  So in my view we are carrying your gospel more effectiv ely with the present arra ngement than we would without it.  I’m absolutely convinced of that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further co mments?  If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the foreign exch ange activities of the Desk? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  I’ll move to ratify the fo reign exchange activities of the Desk. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is there a second? VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  Second. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Objections?  Thank you.  They are approved.   Would somebody like to move to ra tify the domestic operations?  

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  So move. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without  objection, they are approved. Before we move on to the economic discussi on, let me just say that this issue of intervention will reemerge periodically and I think th is was a very useful discussion.   I believe the  24notion that you raised is an im portant one and was well worth disc ussing.  But if any of you have significant thoughts on this issue, a memorandum to either Peter or Do n or Karen would be useful to give us a fuller view of where the Committee is in this regard.  Let’s turn now to Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  On the whole, the data  we have received over the past six weeks have not materially changed our view that the economy is easing onto a path of below-trend growth.  Indeed, we  have made relatively few changes to either our trajectory for overall real GDP or to the underlying components of demand.  With respect to inflation, the figures have contained few surprises aside from the further strengthening of oil prices.  Perhaps the most convincing evidence of a cooling in activity can be found in labor markets.  Monthly gains in priv ate payrolls, which had averaged nearly 200,000 in the twelve months preceding Ma rch, have dropped off to an average of about 150,000 per month since then.  Mo reover, the workweek has slipped a bit since the spring and aggr egate hours worked have b een about flat.  In that regard, it is striking that th e entire 3 percent gain in real GDP that we have projected for the third quar ter is expected to come from increased productivity.   The growth of manufactur ing activity also appears to have ratcheted down from the rapid pace of late last year and early this year.  For the most part, the signs of slowing appear to reflect the identifiable macroeconomic influences that might be expected to follow a tightening of monetary policy.  Auto production is being trimmed in response to some settling back of retail demand, the production of construction supplies has weakened perceptibly, and some materials production--most notably steel --has taken a hit from softening domestic demand and heightened import competition.  Production in the high-tech sector continues to advance briskly, but there doe s appear to have been some moderation here as we ll after the stunning gains we saw earlier this year.    Spending for high-tech equipment also appears to have slowed some in the third quarter, especially for communicatio ns equipment.  Coupled with the hit that many high-tech companies have taken in the equity markets of late, some reports of slowing demand have raised c oncerns about whether this is an area poised for some retrenchment.  To be su re, there are risks here, but we do not yet see the case for abandoning our relative ly upbeat outlook.  In our forecast, high-tech investment participates in th e moderation of investment demand that we expect to accompany the downshift in the pace of final sales.  But with the relative price of this equipment still dec lining at a steady clip, the backlog of unfilled orders high, and considerable unexploited opportunities apparently available, we continue to expect high-t ech investment spending to expand quite rapidly.  Other capital spendi ng also has slowed of la te, and we are projecting  25the growth in these outlays to remain  more subdued going forward owing to the slower pace of business sales and the le ss favorable financing environment that we are expecting over the next two years.  In addition to somewhat less ebulli ent business outlays, our projection depends importantly on a sustained slow down in household spending.  Here, the recent data certainly could give one paus e about our story.  Over the past two months, activity in housing markets has e xperienced a bit of a resurgence.  No doubt, the drop in mortgage rates has provi ded a lift to construction--more so than we had anticipated.  Bu t, even with the recent upt urn in starts, residential investment is likely to post a sizable ne gative for the third quarter.  I should note that new single-family home sales- -released this morning--were revised down about 2-1/2 percent in  July, and they dropped  3 percent in August.  The consumer spending figures also ha ve picked up noticeably of late, but we had largely anticipated this bounce back from the sub- par second-quarter gain.  Moreover, with the exception of that small s econd-quarter increase, our projected growth of 4-3/4 pe rcent in real PCE in the third quarter would be the slowest in a year and a half.  Looking ahead, with mortgage rates stil l up nearly 75 basis points from the middle of last year, with income gains having moderated considerably, and with the stock market having moved sideways this year, we believe that there are solid underpinnings to our forecast that household spending is likely to remain more subdued for the remainder of the year.  A continuation of below-trend grow th in GDP seems the most likely outcome as we move into 2001.  The lagge d effects of your previous tightenings should still be playing out over the next  year or so.  By 2002, those effects begin to wane, and along with a bit more  stimulative discretionary fiscal policy, more rapid growth of exports, and our projected acceleration in structural productivity, there is a more noticeable quickening in the pace of real GDP growth.  That pickup is la rgely held in check by the further increases in the funds rate that we have assumed for la te next year and early 2002.  With the growth of GDP continuing to run belo w that of potential output over the forecast interval, we expect to see the unemployment rate rise to 4-1/2 percent by the end of 2002.  Although the increase in  the jobless rate and our projected gradual decline in oil prices relieve some pressures on business costs and prices, we expect core inflation to extend the updrift that has occu rred over the past year or so.  As you know, that very modest deterioration in our outlook for inflation balances what we view as two key influences about wh ich there are considerable uncertainties --the tightness of resource utilization and the pace of structural productivity growth.   26In recognition of those uncertainties, we gave a bit more emphasis in the Greenbook to the longer-term forecast than  is customary for us when adding a year to the projection.  I trust that yo u will not confuse that greater emphasis on the longer term with any gr eater conviction on our part  about our abilitiy to predict how the economy will evolve two y ears hence.  But we thought it might be useful to illustrate just how sensitive our forecast is to our assumptions as we extend our projection into 2002.  I won’t go into the details of the myriad simulations we included, but I thought two scenarios are worth special no te.  First, what if changes in the structure of our labor and product ma rkets have made it possible for the economy to sustain in equilibrium a 4 per cent rate of unemplo yment--or at least allow us to sustain it to the end of 2002?  In our simulation of a 4 percent NAIRU, core price inflation slows graduall y, rather than increases gradually as in the baseline.  Under these circumstan ces, the need for any further tightening is clearly eliminated, and some easing might be called for.  On the surface, this scenario seems consistent with what might  be built into current financial market expectations.  The second simulation I want to men tion is the one that examines the sensitivity of our outlook to the continued acceleration we are forecasting for structural productivity, from a pace of 3-1/4 percent in 1999 to 3-3/4 percent in 2002.  We contrast our forecast to on e in which the pace of structural productivity has improved, but only to a bout 3 percent, where it remains over the next two years.  This latter assumpti on appears to be closer to the consensus forecast of outside economists.  If that consensus turns out to be closer to the will not be nearly as rosy as we are e xpecting.  The growth of real output will be slower, the unemployment rate will be higher, and inflation will be increasing noticeably.  For the reasons discussed in the Gr eenbook, we are comfortable with the choices we have made about these key elements in the forecast, but there certainly is considerable scope for reasonable men and women to come to different conclusions.  One final important risk in the out look worth mentioning relates to developments in world oil markets.  In this forecast, we have yet again raised our projected path of crude oil prices.  This has resulted in slightly higher headline inflation figures, especially in the second half of this year.  Those higher prices depress disposable inco mes a bit, and tend to weaken our projection for consumer spending.  In putting together this forecast, we asked ourselves whether our inherent “incrementalist” approach could be lead ing us to miss the bigger picture.  The cumulative revision in our oil price for ecast since January has been about $9 per  27barrel this year and has been about $8 per barrel in 2001.  Could the total effects of a shift in prices of this magnitude be larger than the sum of the smaller changes we have made to the forecast?  With one exception that I will mention shortly, we answered no to this question, at least for now.  Bu t there are reasons to be concerned.  On the spending side, we have assumed that households have responded to the negative real income effects of higher energy prices both by reducing spending and by dipping into saving.  Consequently, to the extent that households have viewed the runup as pa rtly transitory, the spending effects have likely been muted.  But if at some point there is a more pronounced reevaluation of the likely permanence to the rise in oil prices, th ere is a risk of a more abrupt downshift in consumer spending.  In financial markets, small changes in  oil prices produce some winners and losers, but probably don’t have significant net effects.  By contrast, large and volatile changes in oil prices could a dd appreciably to uncertainty about the outlook and result in some pulling back from the markets--with consequences for valuations and, ultimately, spending.  There are risks, as well, on the inflat ion side.  Firms may have absorbed some of the higher energy prices in profit margins, in the hopes that these prices would soon recede to earlier levels.  At some point, businesses may be forced to throw in the towel and raise prices more  aggressively.  Workers, too, may have absorbed the direct effects of higher ener gy prices in lower real wages.  But a higher and more persistent level of pri ces could eventually encourage attempts to restore some of the lost real wages through higher nominal wage demands.  To date, we think all of these factors have been at work in small ways, but not in the more abrupt, self-reinforc ing, and nonlinear manner that could pose more significant risks to the outlook.  Consumer confidence has remained high, equity markets have not softened appreci ably, and inflation expectations appear to be well contained.  But we will be watching these developments closely in coming weeks.  The one area where we made a discrete  change was productivity.  The rise in oil prices has now been large enou gh and is expected to persist long enough that we think there could be some minor adverse effects on multifactor productivity.  The need to economize on energy inputs in production and the effects on the profitability of the existing capital stock of the higher relative price of energy have led us to chip a bit off the growth of multifactor productivity over the next couple of years.  Nevertheless, the ch ange is not large enough to prevent some further accele ration in structural productivity.  Karen will now discuss how some of these risks could play out in the rest of the world.  28 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  As Dave noted, the extension of our forecast through 2002 provides an opportunity to c onsider some longer-term issues and risks.  In particular, the longer forecas t horizon allows the implicat ions of our projections for foreign activity, the exchange value of the dollar, and, importantly, global oil prices to be clearly evident in the outcome for real exports and imports. The basic picture we have presented for the rest of the world remains one of robust growth with inflation that is la rgely contained.  As always, a few spots on the globe merit some concern on our part.  Argentina has yet to achieve sustained recovery from the recent cris is despite the rebound in growth in its Latin trading partners.  Some Asian economies, for example the Philippines and Indonesia, still are struggling with the economic implications of what are fundamentally social and political problems.  And the picture remains somewhat mixed among the transitio n economies of Eastern Europe.  Nonetheless, to the extent we can di scern such things, the risks in these countries appear to be country-specific and not likely to trigger broader crises and contagion shoul d trouble erupt.  In putting together the baseline fore cast for the foreign outlook, we too grappled with the issue of how best to  frame the questions raised by the recent shift up in spot and futures oil prices.  We continued w ith our practice of relying heavily on these market prices in specifyi ng the path for global oil prices that is incorporated in the outlook. Th e view implicit in the futu res curve that oil prices are likely to come down over the near term as some elements in demand ease off and supply remains steady seems reas onable.  But the higher level for the entire path relative to that in the August Greenbook reflects our agreement with demand over the forecast period than seemed to be the case six weeks ago.  Nevertheless, we recognize that there are circumstances that could cause oil prices to fall more rapidly than we ha ve now in the forecast as well as others that could generate further upwar d pressure in the short term.  In the baseline Greenbook forecast, the implications for foreign real economic activity of the more elevated path for oil prices vary--depending on whether a country is a net exporter or importer--and are generally quite small.  A small impact is consistent with the substantial reduction in the energy intensiveness of real output  in nearly every major country over the past thirty years.  In addition, we see the current upward pressure on oil prices resulting to a significant extent from the strengt h of global demand.  Global oil production is now above the level reached before OPEC implemented supply restraints in the spring of 1999.  However, that supply ha s not been sufficient to keep prices from rising in the face of the increased demand.  Under these circumstances, we do not anticipate that the elevated ener gy prices will have the negative effects on business and consumer confidence that  characterized previous oil crises.   29With oil inventories apparently low and supply disruptions still a possibility, we included in the Greenbook an  alternative scenario for oil prices.  The particular path that we simulated is that of the price of oil rising to $40 per barrel and remaining there over the entire forecast period.  This alternative is not the most likely path for prices in the event of a supply disruption.  But it does have the property that the oil pr ice is high enough for long enough that our models would show noticeable effects on r eal activity from the direct impact of higher energy costs.  For the United St ates, the assumption used in the model about the response of moneta ry policy determines whet her the impacts of higher oil prices are almost entirely on prices--t he outcome when the fed funds rate is kept at the Greenbook baseli ne--or almost entirely on output, the outcome when monetary policy is tightened in response to the increase in oil prices.  Clearly, intermediate outcomes with some ef fect on both infla tion and output are possible for monetary policy choi ces that are between these two.  For the rest of the world, our model s uggests that the impact of this higher oil price path is noticeable, but not severe .  The particular impact varies from country to country, depending on its oil pr oduction status and on the strength of links to the U.S. economy and the U.S. monetary policy response.  Secondary effects are transmitted across countries th rough relative exchange rate changes that in turn depend upon the monetary pol icy responses to higher oil prices.  Our model results suggest that over the next two years the impact on weighted average foreign GDP growth could range  from negative 0.1 to 0.3 percentage point.  The effects on U.S. real export s and imports depend on the particular U.S. monetary policy assumptions, but on balance U.S. real exports are boosted because of the relatively large share of U.S. exports to the oil-exporting countries such as Mexico, Canada, th e United Kingdom and OPEC.  In nominal terms, the higher cost of U.S. oil im ports swamps effects on our exports and non-oil imports; accordingly, the U.S. no minal trade deficit and current account deficit widen significantly in response to the sustained hi gher oil price.  As in the Greenbook, we did not put into this simulation additional influences on private investment or  consumption that might arise from confidence factors.  Such effects cl early could generate a more negative outcome than this model simulation suggests.  But any judgment on our part of how large to make these negative effects under current  circumstances would be totally arbitrary.  On balance, we are left with the co nclusion that the effects of higher oil prices per se are not likely to threaten our quite positive outlook for the global economy.  More negative outcomes are possible, but they depend importantly on where the shock arises and how it is  transmitted into the global economy.  As a footnote, I would like to report on the Japanese Tankan survey for the third quarter that was released overni ght. That survey showed a bit more positive change than the markets or we were expecting.  Most of the positive  30news relates to responses from large manufacturers; small manufacturers and non-manufacturers continue to lag some what behind.  We continue to be skeptical about the strength of the recovery in Japan and look for real GDP growth there to remain positive over the ne xt two years, but at annual rates of growth in the 1 to 1- 1/2 percent range.   We’ll be happy to answer your questions.     

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Are there any useful  data supporting the general notion of a modest slowdown in the rate of flow of capital from Europe to the United States?  What do we know about that?  I ask because I keep seeing a number mentioned which I don’t quite see in the balance of payments data. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I don’t see that in the balance of payments data either.  We’ll get Q3 data with some lag and then we’ll get the foreign direct investment numbers.  It’s not until we actually have the balance of payments data  for the quarter that  we get the FDI. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We do have portfolio data? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  We have portfolio numbers.  I think there are hints in that but I wouldn’t say there’s anything convincing one way or  the other.  But the Europeans, who on their side may have more data by country that aren’t yet published, say this to me.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It takes a long time for it to go from there to here. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  If there is a slowdown, it’s not  dramatic yet, that’s for sure.  But the Europeans seem to be of the view that there has been, and it may just be that they’re counting the numbers associated with the mergers and acquisiti ons that are going through because in some sense that is what has triggered some of  the most visible flows.  But that ’s a very volatile series and it’s hard to see whether a trend ha s really emerged in it.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Other que stions for Karen or David?  31

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I have two distinct questions, which are completely se parate.  The recent earnings warnings that have come out of Apple and Intel--and I believe Xerox and maybe some others--have referred specifically to  September sales as being consider ably weaker than anticipated.  Is there something there that those companies ar e seeing that we’re not se eing?  Or do you think, having made more buoyant forecasts ear lier, that this is in part a way of covering themselves with the analysts?  That’s one question for you.   Secondly, I want to congratulate  the staff on its careful work  on energy.  I think that was very helpful.  At least on my read ing of that work, this is much mo re than an oil price shock.  What we have is a worldwide demand shock at work here  and there’s a normal lag in trying to adjust production for changes in demand.  Also, there was so me confusion over the inve ntory of stocks that has been built and that kind of thing.  But I think a major part of this story is a worldwide demand shock.  I believe that is very important to empha size because the general discussion of this in the press--including some of the comments economists  have been making about it--I find almost embarrassing.  But I do have a question because I unde rstand that a lot of th e problem now is with refining capacity.  So, even if we get the crude oil, we may have trouble getti ng the finished product.  I understand that refineries in the United States are going flat  out.  What do we know about refineries elsewhere in the world and how close to capacity they are operating?  And do we know anything about the amount of new capacity that’s coming on stream or how long it takes to add capacity in refining? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Well, I’ll start with the first question on the technology sector.  We have not heard uniformly the same kind of re ports on weakness in sales that some of the manufacturers have reported.  Dell , for example, and Compaq have reported that demand has held up quite well.  So at this stage we ’re nervous but we’re not yet willi ng to concede that there has been  32some sea change going on in the tech sector.  As I indicated, the orders pict ure still looks quite good in the aggregate.  And we’re just reading this as part of the noise associated with many of these companies.  For example Intel’s stock price, which has taken such an enormous hit, is still back only to where it was at the turn of the year, after ha ving run up steeply.  So we’re paying careful attention but we don’t think this is necessarily the beginnin g of some significant softening.  Obviously, if it were, it would be troubling because an important part  not just of our aggregate demand forecast but our aggregate supply forecast relies on sustaini ng relatively good performance on the investment side.  So it is a concern. On the issue of refining capacity, things are tight domestically.  I don’t know about the rest of the world.  We do think, however, that ther e’s probably a bit more elasticity in terms of the ability to raise production--for example, of heating fuel going into the winter --than just looking at the overall level of capacity utilization might suggest .  Now, that means, I think, that we will be more vulnerable to any shocks that could occur ov er the next few months, weather being the most obvious one.  But judging from the prices of both the heating fuel and crud e oil, we’re not seeing something that would suggest the anticipation of  exceptionally higher refining margins going into the winter--just normal seasonally high type margins. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I might be bold enough to add a thought regardi ng domestic refining, and that is the issue of maintenance.  There is some question as to how much refining capacity will be shut down for routine maintenance--whether or not that might be postponed a little.  That could give us some leeway to get a bit more product into inventory before the maintenance occurs. With respect to refining capacity  overseas, the information I have  is that the refineries are operating at fairly high levels of capacity, but not at what  one would describe an absolute maximum.  So, there is a small amount of room there.  As to whether in the end that would result in product  33trades that we wouldn’t ordinarily  see happening in the United States, I think there is some scope but not much scope.  And any accident in a refine ry, or any type of unexpected shutdown, could certainly change that  picture quickly. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. MR. GRAMLICH.  I’d like to second Bill Poole’s compliment of the Greenbook, not only on the material on oil prices, but also on the simu lations with alternativ e NAIRU and productivity assumptions.  I know you’ve done these before in th e Bluebook and elsewhere, but with the potential shocks that are possible now I thi nk it makes sense to put these types of exercises in the category of things that are done all the time.  With the simu lations now being elevated to page I-15 of the Greenbook, I think we’re getting closer to  that.  And I think that’s good.   Also, going to half years doesn’t seem like a bi g deal.  We’ve always been able to flip over to the green pages and get th e quarterly numbers, but only for the baseline.  And if one is interested in the effects of a set of assumptions, it’ s much more informative to have half years than full years.  And thirdly, I liked the extension of the forecast horizon.  We know that it’s hard to forecast two years out, but a lot of what we worry a bout here is in the drift.  And often we really can’t see that if the forecast just goes ahead anothe r six quarters.  This extension makes the drift in the forecast very apparent.  So in all senses--both the oil price analysis and the productivity/NAIRU simulations--this Greenbook was to me much more  informative than some of the earlier ones. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Dave, let me ask you a quest ion.  In reading the Greenbook and your projections, I know you haven’t change d your forecast much from the last  time.  We need to adjust for energy, I understand.  But in listening to you I sensed a little more of an acknowledgement of some downside risks in the economy emerging in ma nufacturing and elsewhere.  Is that a fair  34description of the tone that I hear d this morning--that there is a se nse of greater downside risks than you felt before, even though the projections themselves are pretty much unchanged? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I’m not sure I would say that  in the aggregate I see the downside risks as larger than the upside risks to this forecast.  Ther e are a couple of areas that I wanted to highlight.  One relates to the developments in the technology sector.  Sec ond, while our simulations suggest that the oil price increases should have a relatively modest effect on overall output, I think there are risks in that regard as well.  On  the confidence side, we haven’t seen  much effect yet.  Nevertheless, one could easily imagine if we got not just a pric e spike but a true supply disruption comparable to what was apparent in Europe th is fall, there could be a more pronounced negative effect on overall sentiment.  On the other hand, there are a couple  of areas where we could envision some upside risks.  One I cited was the housing area.  While we think that is likely to be short lived, we were surprised by the vigor of the recent rebound.  And while consumer spending has turned out pretty much as we had anticipated, on the whole there has probably been a firmer tone to what has occurred in that sector.  So I think we see a bit of upsid e and downside risks there.  I think in a period of slowing it’s natural to be more concerned about the downside ri sks one is identifying because often developments occur that tend to rein force that downward momentum.   

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, t oo, want to add my thanks to the staff for doing as much work as they di d, particularly on the supply side is sues, forecasting out further in time, and the alternative productivity and NAIRU si mulations. They were helpful to me in thinking about some of these issues.    35I’m interested in your table on structural labor  productivity on page I- 9.  We used to think that productivity growth at something around 2 per cent, or maybe a little lower, would double the standard of living of the United States in some thing like 40 years.  In noticing the tick up in structural labor productivity from 2.9 to 3.7 percen t over the forecast period, I was struck by the fact that this would suggest that th e time period over which a doubling of  the standard of living would occur is now something closer to 20 years.  That is  rather awe inspiring, and maybe it’s true.  I guess there have been short periods of time in the past when that kind of productivity growth has occurred.  But thinking about it that way struck me.   The second issue, with regard to the alternative simulations, involves the feedback effect from productivity into demand.  We’re  looking at numbers--at 4 percen t or a little better for both  2001 and 2002--that are at least ½ percen tage point or a bit more than the consensus of forecasters.  If one takes away the assumptions  about rising structural produc tivity, as you mentioned, demand is down to around the mid 3 percent ra nge.  That’s a big change.  And it seems to have to do totally with the feedback from productivity into demand, either positively or negatively.  I just thought I’d mention those points that occurred to me as questi ons or observations as I l ooked at this and ask you to comment on them.   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  With respect to the productivity forecast I’d say two things.  One is that we have had occasions where multifactor productivity has risen at this pace for an extended period of time.  So this wouldn’t be something that is unprecedented historically.  Secondly, however, if we were doing a 10- or 15-year foreca st, I don’t think we would necessarily project either the growth of multifactor productivity or th e pace of capital deepening to be sustained at the kind of increases we are seeing now.  In some sense the approach that we have shifted to here, which  36endogenizes these supply side factors, means that we  are also going to be sens itive to future business cycles where a period of slowing in  overall activity could feed back into investment and therefore--  

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So this is sort of temporary? MR. STOCKTON.  Yes, in the sense that we’re only forecasting out through 2002.  Over a long-term horizon I’d certainly hate to be pinn ed down in forecasting developments in an area where we have not exactly covered ourselves in glor y even over the short term.  But I would caution that if I were a budget analyst, I wouldn’t necessarily take that 2002 figure and extend it out for the next 10, 15 years. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.   So do you have a ny idea where this plateaus?   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  As the Chairman has noted many times, we’re not sure where we are in this technological diffusion proces s.  That knowledge really is so  important in terms of getting to the crux of this matter.  And it is just terribly diffic ult to know.  Thus far the overall return to capital has not shown any signs of tipping down, though one mi ght expect it to do so.  If we were really pushing capital deepening in a sense beyond where it ought to be , we would expect to see a significant weakness.  Now I would quickly want to-- 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  There has been a bit of a downturn from the very high levels. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Yes, that’s true; there has been just a tad.  Th e downturn is pretty much within the noise of those data  at this point.  But I would also  caution that what we are really observing there is the average return to capital, no t the marginal return to capital.  If one were concerned about the tech sector, for example, it’s possible that the most r ecent investments aren’t going to reach the same rates of return that investor s either are looking for or have experienced in the recent past.  So I think there are so me risks there as well.  We just  don’t know where we are in that  37technology-spreading process at this  point.  Nevertheless, at this stage we don’t see any reason to think that it’s going to be on a slowing trend in terms of multifactor productivity. With respect to the feedback effects, in the case where we show a lower growth of structural productivity, those effect s are quite potent in the model fo r the reasons that we discussed earlier this year on the up side.  In that si mulation there are going to  be some significant disappointments in the growth of  output and the growth in prof its.  Those disappointments would lead to some retrenchment in overall equity markets,  as well as some downshift in people’s desire to add to the capital stock of housing and automobiles and other consumer durabl es. That in turn leads that simulation to produce a significant weakening in  overall activity from its recent pace.  But even with that weakening, that lower productivity assumption is potent enough that we could still get some increase in overall inflation.  So it’s the worst of all possible worlds. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.  Slower  growth, higher inflation.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If nobody else  has questions or comments, would somebody like to start the Committee discussion?  President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, employment in the We st continued to expand at a solid     2-3/4 percent pace in July and August.  In contrast to the remainder of the District, California’s job count has slowed somewhat in recent months.  The data show weakness in business services, in part due to layoffs at some dot-coms, although indicati ons are that those laid off are having no trouble finding jobs.  Construction employment  also has tailed off.  Even s o, the employment statistics may be overstating the slowing in the State, given that  growth in income tax withholding in California has remained strong.   An area of strength in the District has b een high-tech activity re lated to semiconductor manufacturing.  The semiconductor industry has added manufacturing jobs in th e District this year,  38following two years of job cuts.  And worldwide semiconductor sales are running well ahead of last year.  The pickup reflects strength in the demand for chips used in Intern et-related products, hand- held computers, and communications devices.   Across the District, however, real estate  activity--both commercial and residential construction--is moderating.  Office rents have le veled off in a number of cities in the region, including Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Las Ve gas, and Salt Lake City.  In contrast, rents continue to climb in the San Fran cisco Bay and the Seattle areas.  Prices for wholesale electricity remain high and volatile in the West.  The Californi a Public Utilities Commission has adopted a rate stabilization plan for the deregulated San Diego ar ea.  However, this plan, along with the existing rate ceilings in other parts of California where deregulation has b een only partly phased in, has only put off the decision about who will cover the billions  of dollars in revenue shortfalls for companies such as San Diego Gas and Electri c, Pacific Gas and Electric, a nd Southern California Edison.   Turning to the national economy, I find it en couraging that core inflation hasn’t accelerated in recent months despite higher oil prices  and that the pace of economic activity seems to have moderated in the third quarter.  Like th e Greenbook, our real GDP forecast for that quarter shows an increase of 3 pe rcent, which is down about ½ percenta ge point from our August forecast.  Obviously, it’s too early to tell if the slowdown will be sustained, but developments in financial past tightening actions, should help  to contain demand.  Of course, the wild card for both inflation and economic activity is energy pric es, which have defied expectati ons of a substantial decline for some time now.  Our longer-term forecast shows gr owth in real GDP slowing from 4-1/4 percent this year to a range of 3-1/2 to 4 percent next year under the assump tions of no further change in the funds rate and a constant value of the U.S. dollar.   39Even with the slowdown we ar e expecting, labor markets w ill remain tight through the end of next year, generating some upward pressure on core inflation.  Higher energy prices also have boosted our forecast of core inflation to some ex tent.  As in the Greenbook, our forecast assumes that energy prices will decline over the next se veral quarters, which works to obscure upward pressures in our core inflation measures.  We expect  core PCE prices to increase about 2 percent this year and slightly more next year.  Overall inflationary risks may have  lessened a bit since we met in the balance of risks for inflation going forward stil l is on the up side and I don't think we should be content with core inflatio n measures as high as 2 percent, esp ecially given the likelihood that they

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would now characterize growth in our Southeast region as moderate.  While conditions have  not changed materially since our last meeting, we are seeing some further signs of slowing in the pace of growth, and I will mention just a few. More retailers than before are acknowledging that sales are falling below plans and those expectations had already been adjusted down.  The trade imbalance is very obvious in our port cities where imports are expanding at twic e the rate of exports.  And we may be seeing the first hints of some slowing in the pace of tourism.  Fall booking s in our major tourist ma rkets are just slightly ahead of last year and growth in  casinos along the Missi ssippi Gulf Coast has slowed markedly.  The latter may be at least partially attributable to saturation and some environmental controls over development. We try to keep an especially close eye on real estate since it has been our region’s Achilles heel more than once in past cycles.  Although the FDIC recently included Atlanta among  40cities where it has concerns about  overbuilding in commercial real  estate, our economists and bank examiners have not yet seen the tel ltale signs of trouble.  Office vacan cy rates remain in the 10 to 15 percent range in the District’s major metropolitan areas.  And commercial indus trial vacancy rates in all but Orlando have remained stable or declined in  the past year or so.  One area we are watching in Atlanta is the dependence of the office market on high-tech compan ies.  In 1999 high-tech tenants accounted for 80 percent of the net absorption of new office space, although a good share of that was established mainline high-tech companies and not the more volatile dot-coms.  We also note a growing sense of general caution as the pace of economic activity has moderated.  Our larger banks report that loan demand has declined noticeably from  year-ago levels.  And there is evidence that financing terms are now more stri ngent, especially for second-tier borrowers.  I also hear more stories of projects being put on hold until the future path of the economy becomes clearer. As I noted when we last met, there are a few places where labor markets are a bit less tight, but our regional un employment rate is still a tick or two below the nationa l level and labor availability remains an issue.  We detect no specif ic areas of new price pre ssures other than a general concern about higher energy costs, their futu re path, and the longe r-term implications. As far as the broader national economy is c oncerned, we see further confirming evidence of the moderation we talked about in August.  As has already been noted, in addition to a slowing in housing and autos, manufacturing, especially outside  of high-tech, continues to moderate.  Our modeling work suggests that the moderate rate of gr owth will likely continue.  Like others, we have spent considerable time trying to assess the implica tions of the run-up in oil prices.  And I would echo the comments of others that th e staff papers we got on that subj ect were particularly helpful.  While clearly there has been some  modest impact on GDP, it does not appear to be large.  Perhaps the most important implication may be the effect on inflation expectations, as the most recent run-up  41works its way through the headline inflation measur es and as consumers begin to get their winter heating bills.  If the higher oil pr ices turn out to be short-lived, as  futures markets believe to be the case, then this may turn out to be only a modest shock. We are encouraged by the gene rally benign inflation data, although when one decomposes the current inflation path into the energy component and other components, there remains an upward tilt in core prices that should not  be discounted.  I think we have to be pleased with the moderation we are getting in economic activity and the more su stainable path the economy  seems to have settled into.  At the same time, I believe it would be prem ature to adjust our much-watched balance of risks statement.  For me at least, there are a number of  upside risks on the inflation front.  Those include the uncertainty about the long-term sustainability of the recent very large productivity gains and their implications for unit labor costs, the possibility of a more stimulativ e fiscal policy, and the real and expectational inflation effects of  higher energy costs still working their way through the pipeline.  I think we are where we want to be, at least for the mome nt.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, at our m eeting in August the information on our District that I had at the time suggested a more mixed picture in the lower Middle Atlantic region, at least by comparison to the unambiguous ly strong growth we were seeing in the first half of the year.  And the picture is still mixed.  As has been me ntioned for other District s, there are signs of moderating activity in some sector s.  Higher fuel prices are damp ing sales of vehicles generally, especially the larger SUVs and trucks.  They are squeezing the profits of some of the trucking companies in our region, and we have a large number  of these companies.  But at the same time, a significant portion of the anecdotal information we  have received in the la st two or three weeks suggests that demand may be strengt hening, or at least not weakening any further.  Just to cite a  42couple of examples to back that up :  Back-to-school sales were report ed to be unexpectedly strong in our region, and those are sometimes said to be harb ingers of upcoming holiday  sales; recent declines in mortgage rates have definitely stimulated new residential construction and sales of both new and existing homes in our area; and respondents to our la test monthly services sector survey indicated that their revenues were firming.  Also, labor markets are still ve ry tight in our area.  Our Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Council met last week, and though they told the same old story of a tight job market I was struck by the intensity of some of the comments  members made about the competition for capable workers.  One fellow said that he had recently ra ised wage rates across the board by about 10 percent to stop what he referred to as “poaching” of his workforce by his competitors. In sum, of course it is always hard to know  whether this somewhat stronger tone in the last several weeks is just noise or perhaps seasonal  influences.  Nevertheless,  I have some sense at least that business activity is no longer decelerating in our region. With respect to the national economy, I thi nk the key questions ri ght now center on the underlying growth rate of structural  productivity, the extent to which that growth rate is anticipated and perceived by the public, and the net impact of  those two factors on in flation going forward.  I see that impact working through two channels:  First, the effect on the aggregate demand/supply balance and second, the effect on unit labor costs.  And I want to a dd my compliments to the others you've received, Dave and Karen, because the simula tions, especially the ones on productivity, were very helpful in thinking through these issues.  I k now I am repeating other compliments, but I have been reading these Greenbooks for 30 years and I think you are on a roll! The baseline Greenbook forecast projects high but  fairly steady structural productivity growth over the forecast horizon that is fully anticipated by the public.  I think that is a key point.  If  43that turns out to be right, then  the apparent moderation in demand nationally over the second and third quarters may be a good sign.  It may indicate that we have the real funds rate now where it needs to be to bring the growth of aggregate dema nd in line with the sustai nable growth of potential output.  But, obviously, there are other possible outcomes and you recognize a lot of these.  We could have a further acceleration of  structural productivity  growth, although that is not very likely at this point given the level of your projections.  A mo re likely prospect, I thi nk, is that the increases projected by the Greenbook for the current year and for 2001 and 2002 are not yet fully anticipated.  They are, after all, higher than most of th e published or publicly announced private sector projections and simulations I've seen.  If the Gr eenbook projections are right, expected future income and wealth would rise as the publ ic recognizes that productivity gr owth is higher than they had anticipated, and that could genera te renewed excess growth in de mand going forward.  Now, your productivity surprise simulation, of course, incorporates this effect and recognizes that at some point that could put upward pressure on inflation.  Bu t the actual numbers in your simulation show virtually no effect, at least for the next couple of years.  I guess what  happens is that the presumably positive effect on demand is outweighed by the negative effect on unit labor costs.  And I recognize that things could well work out that way.  But the n ear-term impact of a furthe r increase in expected income and wealth on aggregate demand could well be greater over the for ecast horizon of the next few years than the simulations suggest.  That coul d be a problem since we ar e already seeing at least an uptick in core inflation.  A nd many people are projecting a fu rther increase as recent energy prices work their way through the economy or if the dollar drops more than anticipated in the Greenbook forecast.  So, like others, I think the bala nce of risk is still on the up side, though maybe not as decidedly as it was a while back.  Therefore,  I also think that we should leave the tilt in our press release in place.  44I believe it is worth reminding ourselves in th is context that the accelerated technological progress and capital deepening are not the only factor s driving the “new economy,” if that is indeed what we have.  Another absolutely critical elemen t has been our enhanced cr edibility--first, that we have achieved price stability or some close approxim ation of it and secondly, that the credibility of our strategy is so much stronger than it was.  A nd I don’t think we should take that credibility for granted.  I think the latter pa rt of Bob Parry’s statement wa s right on the money and I would certainly agree with his poin t of view on that.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. MR. SANTOMERO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It  is a pleasure to have an opportunity to talk about conditions in the Thir d District.  Activity in our Distri ct is basically flat, with some The unemployment rate has remained steady at about  3.9 percent for the three states, slightly below the nation's 4.1 percent rate.  Consumer price infla tion is accelerating in the District but remains below that of the nation.  Employme nt costs accelerated in the first ha lf of the year reflecting tighter labor markets.  Somewhat surprisingly, given the r ecent increases in oil prices, manufacturers in our Business Outlook Survey reported less upward pressure on prices paid than they did earlier in the year.  Most manufacturers are ho lding their own prices steady.  Signs of slowing are found in construction and bank loan growt h.  Housing permits, employment in the construction sector, the value of residential and nonresid ential contracts, and both exis ting and new home sales are down from levels at the beginning of the year.  At the same time, C&I, consumer, and residential mortgage lending have slowed somewhat since June.  While retail sales did show a rebound as a result of back-to-school sales, year-over-year increases were  below expectations, cont rary to some of the  45comments of others here today.  And retail sales we re flat this summer.  The outlook over the next six months is that growth will resume but that th e pace will be no faster than in the first half. In terms of our perspective on the nation, economic growth in our view slowed in the third quarter toward its long-term trend rate but may be  picking up in the fourth quarter.  Household investment in housing and vehicles slowed from th e pace we saw earlier in the year but appears to have stabilized.  Still,  if oil prices remain high, the eff ect on growth could be negative, though probably not as big as the effects in the 1970s and 1980s.  Equity mark et investors suggest that there is a fear of a slowdown and their violent re action to earnings disappoi ntment is noteworthy. On the inflation side, rising oil prices ha ve led to an acceleration in consumer and producer price inflation.  More troubl ing is the fact that core infl ation has also shown a moderate acceleration.  Over this expansion CPI inflation has averaged about 2.5 percent, but it is not likely to fall further based on recent inflation figures and the st aff forecast.  Both of these factors suggest that inflationary expectations are a r eal concern going forward, so I share some of the reservations about the future that have been expressed here today. We like to think about this in an historical perspective.  In the fa ll of 1998 the Fed lowered the fed funds rate by 75 basis points in  three steps in the wake of a fina ncial crisis.  It is likely that the data after that point really reflect the core inflation reactin g to the expansion.  The Fed has subsequently raised the fed funds rate to 6.5 percen t and that may be enough to stem the acceleration of core inflation. The tightening the Fed has done to  date has not yet been fully felt in the economy, but higher productivity growth sugges ts that the equilibrium real rate  should be higher.  Observed inflation is likely to be higher and the growth of  the goods and labor market s is still something to watch.  Long-term inflation expectations in our Survey of Professional Forecasters have been holding steady, which is interesting.  Respondents still antic ipate that th e CPI over a ten-year period  46will be 2.5 percent.  They believe, I guess, that inflation will be held in check by the Federal Reserve. That is the end of my formal remarks, but I feel some obligation to commend the staff.  I can't do so on a relative basis; I don’ t have that framework.  But in an  absolute sense I can say that I did enjoy and appreciate the hard work they did in the materials provided to us.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. MR. MCTEER.  The economy in the Eleventh District has begun to strengthen modestly in recent months, with employment growth expanding at an annual rate of just  over 3 percent.  While the national economy has been slowed by the head winds of higher interest  rates, higher energy prices, a stronger dollar, and a sput tering stock market, Texas and the rest of the Eleventh District have been steering into cross winds  instead.  Higher oil and natural gas prices have provided some lift to the District economy at the same time as a strong Mexican economy and strong peso have boosted demand for exports from Texas.  While we of ten think of the United St ates as a has-been in the energy business, it does remain the largest oil and gas producer in the Western Hemisphere, trailing only Saudi Arabia and the former Soviet  Union in oil production and the former Soviet Union in gas production.  Texas produ ces almost a fourth of U.S. oil and about a third of its natural gas.  The Texas rig count, about 80 percent of whic h involves drilling for na tural gas, has continued its strong upward trend that bega n in the spring.  At our last board meeting one of our banking directors noted that he had just made his first loan on a rig in many year s after having sworn he would never do so again!  Low oil inventories and high product prices are he lping both oil producers and refiners.  But petrochemical companies are ca ught in a squeeze between record high prices for natural gas feed stocks and excessive inventor ies stemming from new capacity brought on line in  47recent years.  This has resulted in a sharp drop in  construction of new plants in the Houston/Gulf Coast area. While the value of heavy construction has d eclined sharply, reside ntial construction has leveled off at a high plateau.  Shortages of some home construction materials seem to have ended, though products requirin g major energy inputs such as  roofing, cement, and brick, are rising in price.  This is being offset by declines in prices of lu mber and sheet rock.  A sharp slowdown in apartment construction in Dallas and Houston has freed up a sufficient number of skilled construction workers to relieve the shortages that were a problem ear lier in the year.  Some suburban markets are beginning to show signs of apartm ent overbuilding, and one month's free rent and other incentives are now being offered.  The resurgence in high-t ech has helped to boost the Texas economy but disquieting signs are beginning to emerge.  Se miconductor sales growth remains strong but has slowed recently.  Inventories have risen modestly a nd large increases in capacity are due to come on line soon.  Fears of falling prices and shrinking profit margins have begun to spread through the industry and among its investors.  Export demand fo r Texas products continues to rise sharply.  Nearly half of all of Texas exports go to Mexi co, so the strong dollar has mattered less for the Eleventh District economy than for the rest of the country.  Mexico has been helped by higher oil prices, a strong economy, large capita l inflows, and a political situat ion that has been more stable than many anticipated a few months ago.   Turning to the national economy, I must say th at I agree with the broad outline of the Greenbook forecast.  Growth will remain healthy and could moderate a bit next year.  The modest inflation reprieve we have experien ced this year is likely to subside over the next couple of years.  I applaud the writers of the Greenbook for raising thei r estimates of structural  productivity growth and potential output expansion to be more in keeping with the economy's experience in recent years.   48And I agree with Al Broaddus and others that th e Greenbook writers are on a roll, but I don't share Al’s worry that productivity growth might be inflationary in the next few months. As for inflation risks looking forward, I re main encouraged by longer-term productivity trends, which have allowed supply and demand grow th to remain well balanced.  While the short-term inflation risks remain on the up side, I take encouragement from the continued strength of the dollar, the steadiness of gold prices, and the softness in non-energy commodity prices.  My inclination is for monetary policy to remain on hold for the time being. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.   MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On balance, the economic expansion in the Seventh District continues to show signs of slowi ng amidst continued tight labor markets and reports of increasing pressure on profit margins from highe r costs, particularly for wages, health care benefits, and energy.  So far competition has kept  many firms from passing these costs along in the form of higher prices to custom ers, but several contacts felt that we were nearing the point where prices might have to give.  The vast majority of our contacts continue to report a slowing in activity, with the list of industries now in cluding retailing, housing, motor vehicl es--especially heavy trucks-- railcars, steel, aluminum, plastic, cement, wallboard, and paper.  One of our directors who serves on several corporate boards noted that there will be  more reports from the truck and heavy equipment industries of layoffs and downsizing in addition to those that have already been announced by firms such as Navistar.  Another direct or reported that auto dealers are concerned that it might take even larger incentives to work down th eir currently high inventory levels. Having noted the large number of reports of slowing, there are a few caveats I’d like to mention.  First, while the trend seems to suggest  a slowing, housing markets have been mixed of late, perhaps reflecting lower mortgage rates as Dave Stockton and others have mentioned this  49morning.  Second, reports continue to suggest that purchases of home-related items like furniture and appliances remain strong.  And finally, overall ma nufacturing in our Distri ct appears to have expanded modestly in September.  Composite i ndexes from surveys of purchasing managers in Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee all moved back a bove the 50 percent level- -to the 51 to 52 percent range--after all three indexes were below 50 percent in August.  At our last meeting I said we had seen a few signs of possible easing in labor markets, but that does not seem to be the case now.  Our A dvisory Council on Agriculture, Labor, and Small Business met in September and, like our direct ors and other business contacts, they spent considerable time discussing the pr oblems of finding and retaining qua lity workers.  For example, our agricultural council members noted that cattleme n are ready to build a ne w packing plant in Iowa but have been unable to find a community in which to build it in large part due  to labor shortages.  Small businesses noted that quality-of-life issues su ch as scholarships for employees’ children, time off, fitness centers, and so on were  coming to the fore in recruitmen t.  And the labor advisory group reported that employee turnover had increased, so th ere has been more focus on retention strategies, often in the form of staying bonuses a nd more training and development.   In terms of an anecdote closer to home, the Chicago Fed recently hosted the System Leadership Conference.  Of th e three electives offered--one was on technology, one was on media relations, and the third was on re taining and attracting people--by far the most popular among the 60 some odd people from the System who attended  the conference was the one on retaining and attracting people. For the most part our contacts continue to sa y that gains in productivity enable them to pay higher wages without raising prices.  Examples range from redesigned steel mills to Web sites that bring together buyers and se llers of grain within a 100- to 200-mile radius, bypassing the local  50grain elevators.  Furthermore, council members sa id that the outlook for pr oductivity gains is good since most firms have only star ted to tap the possibili ties available through new technologies.  On the other hand, one small business representative cautioned that continued pressure on employees was beginning to take its toll and he felt that there were some human limits to these increases in productivity. Turning to the national economy, recent data ha ve tended to confirm the view I mentioned at our last meeting that the U.S.  economy is well positioned for a soft  landing.  I still think the risks are tilted somewhat more toward increased inflati on.  In particular, we expect the economy to slow to a pace only a little below potential, so labor mark ets likely will remain tight.  Moreover, oil prices now seem more likely to stay at le vels that would lead to more spil lover into core inflation than we expected earlier this year.  And given the deceleration in output growth, productivity gains probably will moderate some.  But given the continued pace of capital deepening and the reports we get from high-tech and other firms about th e opportunities for furt her technological advan ces, any slowing in productivity growth should be relatively modest.  In addition, higher energy prices should slow real consumer spending a bit.  So, while I believe that  the risks remain tilted to ward inflation, it will be important for us to be watchful that signs of slowing in the economy do not become excessive.  Mr. Chairman, after all the compli ments that the staff has receiv ed this morning, I feel that if I don't compliment them they will think that I wa s disappointed.  I do not want to disappoint them, so I would note that I particularly liked the paper on the outlook fo r oil demand and supply.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN .  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  R ecently one director started off the go- around at our board meeting by relating what he cons idered to be an anecdote about conditions in labor markets.  But I interpreted it somewhat diff erently, and I'll come back to that.  He said he  51overheard another customer in a store where he wa s shopping complain to the manager about one of the store’s employees.  And the manager responded,  “I t is easier to get a new customer than it is to get a new employee!”  [Laughter]  That raised in  my mind the question a bout appropriate quality adjustments in the services sector, and we could all probably compare anec dotal stories about that. As for other reports about labor markets, layoffs have been announced by Eaton, Dana, and smaller trucking parts companies.  KeyCorp has announced a very major layoff, which is not limited to our District but covers the seven Distri cts where they operate.  Reduced overtime in motor vehicle assembly plants and part s supply firms is becoming a problem .  One banker in the northwest part of Ohio, where there are a lot of assembly pl ants, noted that his customers had worked so much overtime for so long that they had started to view th eir overtime pay as part of their base wage.  That loss of extra overtime income is now being reflect ed in late payments, delinquencies, and even bankruptcies.  We're starting to hear of a few cases, again from our community bank advisory council, of some people just walkin g in and turning in their keys. Other directors and advisory council member s commented that the higher energy prices seem to have cut into discretionary spending even  before winter has arrived in our part of the country.  Specifically, it was repor ted that entertainment spending for sporting events and movie theaters had dropped noticeably in th e past two months.  In fact, one theater chain announced that it is leaving the mid-Ohio region.  A banker said he e xpects to have to start reposessing powerboats he financed earlier this year.  Because of high gas pri ces a lot of them wound up staying moored in the consume 20 to 25 gallons per hour of running time. Reports about the retail sector indicate consid erably more softening in our region than the data suggest for the nation; in f act it was claimed that we did not get a back-to-school sales bounce.   52A manufacturer/distributor of packag ed pastries said that  corporations are cutt ing their gift budgets, and orders for the fourth quarter are off significantly  from a year ago.  I’m not sure how to interpret that particular anecdote because a year ago I assume a lot of compan ies had planned substantial gift budgets for Y2K rewards and recognition.  So a year-over-year comparison might not be very reliable.  In the retail sector going forward, we were reminded that  November last year was very weak, so on a year-over-year basis November shoul d be good.  If it is not, that ought to be significant.  And there is an extra Saturday and more days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, so the retailers are optim istic that they will do better in  December-over-December as well. One of our directors who is affiliated with a national newspaper chain reported that ad revenue has been off sharply in the last couple of  months.  Another reported, with respect to the retail sector, that in the past 60 days the FTC has sharply increased the fines they impose on retailers for failing to meet promised delivery schedules, which is probably pretty sobering for the online sales sector. In manufacturing, truck assemblies and parts ha ve been off sharply this year.  Also, the very much higher diesel costs--one  contact asserted that diesel fu el prices were double what they were but I don't know the timeframe  he was using--have greatly incr eased the operating costs of the trucking companies that are headquar tered in the region, some of which operate nationally of course.  A characterization of how pervasiv e the effects may be was the sugge stion that partly because of just-in-time inventory, we should start thinking th at the United States has put its warehouses on wheels, and rolling warehouses do consume fuel.   Reports from both large and small banks indicat e that even in the face of slowing loan demand and a dwindling number of  applications in the pipeline,  proposals are now being turned  53down that would have been accepted a year ago.  Bankers  also tell us that not only have their interest Turning to the national economy, I also thought  all of the simulations provided by the staff were useful.  I think these ki nds of exercises, static as they  sometimes are--and I recognize that getting them to be dynamic and interactive is qu ite difficult--are very useful to conditioning our thinking.  If one reflects on what  has happened over the last few years--in oil prices, productivity, economic growth, and exchange rate s in a couple of notable instan ces--we might have been better able to think through the appropriate  policy had we sensitized ourselv es more to the implications of these kinds of events.  But looking back at the ra nge of developments over the last few years, my guess is that we would have had a very hard time  imagining just how far a number of these things would go.  So, looking out at least to 2002 is a very desirable thing for us to do.  And I agree with the suggestion that looking out even  further would be helpful, ev en if we don't have a lot of confidence in any one scenario actually playing ou t or coming close to what actually will happen. I think back to four or five years ago and the inherited situation at the time, with inflation somewhere in the 2 to 3 percent range depending on which measure one looks at.  Had we been able to anticipate the acceleration in productivity growth  from about 1 percent or so then to where we have seen it in recent years, in an  ideal policy sense I woul d have preferred to take  all of that gain in productivity to lower the rate of inflation.  I w ould have favored a very opportunistic response in order to lock the gains in productiv ity into a lower inflation trend.  We took maybe half of that; it's a very judgmental thing.  I think some of the favorab le developments in productivity have reduced the trend rate of inflation, but not by as much as I w ould have liked.  Going forward, I would like to be able to take advantage of all of  any further increases in productiv ity growth to lower the inherited rate of inflation, whatever the underl ying monetary inflation trend may be.  54That does raise a question of st rategy, in terms of how we would go about doing that.  The baseline forecast in the Greenbook has us starting off from the current position, where the economy is operating somewhat above some notion of our na tional potential.  And as skeptical as I am in today's world about the notion of a potential output either in labor  markets or some other way of measuring our capacity, I don't find that approach very  convincing.  I am just not sure and I wouldn’t know how to convince somebody else that we are now operating above capacity.  Nevertheless, going forward the baseline forecast has output growing somewhat more slowly than potential growth, so that takes some of the pressure off infl ation in the framework that  is being used there.  But that does raise a question about how we think about the increase in  interest rates since June of 1999, particularly the fed funds rate.  I still don't find it useful to thi nk in terms of a real fed funds rate.  Normally when we talk about real interest rates in a Fisher equation sense, we say that the appropriate horizon for the expected rate of inflation is the duration of the instrument we are talking about--whether it's the 30-year, the 10-year, or whatev er.  Well, in that sens e, I find it troubling to think about a real component in th e overnight interbank rate.  Inst ead, I like to think about whether or not the current nominal fed funds rate is calibrated at a level that will ensure that we do not, in an accommodative sense, inject excessive central bank liquidity.  Doing so woul d turn a favorable real side development--productivity growth--into an ex cess demand situation, thereby creating inflation.  I’m not there at this point.  I canno t conclude that a fed funds rate of 6-1/2 percent is too low.  I would be looking for evidence of these favorable  productivity developments showing through in other market measures, especially in financial mark ets, telling me that the 6-1/2 percent nominal fed funds rate is too low.  It’s a very tough issue.   So at the moment as I look out to 2002 and the baseline forecast, my own very loose judgment would be  that the trend rate of inflation is going to be  55

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, before we resume our discussion, let me mention the Basel capital accord.  If all goes well, on our pr esent schedule the Basel Committee will approve the new accord at a meeting to be held in New York in mid-December.  I thought it might be useful to take advantage of the December meeting of this Committee to provide an opportunity to brief the Reserv e Bank presidents--and your heads of  supervision, if you wish to bring them with you--on that subjec t.  We would plan to give a 2 to 2-1/2 hour briefing on what the accord is so that you will be fam iliar with it before it is made pub lic, as presently scheduled, on the 16th of January.  If that is attractive to  you, would you let Don Kohn know whether you would prefer to have that sessio n on Monday afternoon, the day before the meeting, or on Tuesday afternoon, the day of the meeting?  Considering th e length of the briefing a nd the heaviness of the material, you might want to make it on Monda y afternoon, but please inform Don of your preference.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tent h District as a regi on is continuing to do very well in terms of economic activity, but it is apparent to us that growth is slowing.  While overall employment growth in the District is ab out the same as in the nation, private employment growth is about ½ percentage point  slower overall.  Nonresidential construction reflects the softer conditions in our area.  The value of  District nonresidential constructi on has fallen in three of the last four months and remains significantly below previ ous peaks in the region.  Homebuilding also has slowed--not as dramatically perh aps, but it’s still a couple of percentage points below year-ago  56levels.  Manufacturing activity in the District also  has moderated.  Manufacturing jobs actually fell about 0.3 percent in August and are down about 0.6 per cent from a year ago.  So, we have seen some slowing there, in part due to higher fuel costs and so forth. Of course, the area in our District that is suddenly doing well rela tes to the oil and gas industries, especially natural gas.  Like Texas, we  produce a lot of natural gas.  Our rig count is up about 125 percent and employment in that sector is  up rather significantly as  well.  So we do have activity starting to pick up now as people are be coming more confident that  higher oil prices are going to last for a while and are therefore willing to bring some activity back into play.   Retail sales generally have been  steady and actually have been fairly strong in the Denver area, as has the whole economy in that region.  But,  overall, with some slowing we have seen a little loosening of labor market conditions.  The unemp loyment rate remains about the same or a bit higher in different areas of the regi on as well.  Price pr essures have also rema ined steady, despite the fact that some raw materials costs, of course , are going up and have to be dealt with by the manufacturing companies.  We haven’t seen those hi gher costs come through at all at the retail level; we’ve actually heard some talk of easing price pressures there.   Our agricultural sector is s till seeing very weak prices.  That industry is very much dependent upon government payments a nd will continue to be so throug h next year at least, based on the bumper production we see in our region.  So we  have a strong economy but with some slowing apparent. At the national level, incoming data have  done little to change my outlook on the economy.  From the information I have heard here a nd our own analysis I woul d say that growth of economic activity is in a longer-term  slowing phase.  Since the beginni ng of the year, I think the flat stock market, the higher energy costs in play, an d the tighter monetary policy have cooled off  57consumer spending.  And while investment spendi ng remains very good, our projection is that its growth will be down from the earlier  high level, and I think that wi ll play a role as well.  As compared to the Greenbook forecast, our projecti on is for a stepping down of GDP growth toward the 3-1/2 percent area.  We also see that occurring wit hout further increases in the fed funds rate from its level today.  The risks, of course, are re lated to energy, which we’ve talked about.  And, yes, energy costs could push overall pric es up and that could actually slow the economy.  The situation could be complicated if personal in come levels fall and the debt burde ns in our economy have to be dealt with.  So, those are the downside risks.   In essence, while I wouldn’t fall on my sword on this, Mr. Ch airman, I think the risks are more balanced than they have b een.  I would feel comfortable sa ying that with a balanced risk statement, even with these economic projections, becau se I think the higher rates are still in play.  We have seen a slowing expansi on and I think that is continuing, which gives us a picture of an economy with more balanced ri sks in the future.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As th e headline in the Wall Street Journal’s New England Economic Focus put it:  “E conomy slows, but very gently.”  In fact, it is rather hard to see the slowing.  Housing is off a bit but manuf acturing and manufactured exports remain strong.  Employment growth, net of strike and Census wo rker noise, has decelerated but it’s not much different from the historical nor m for the region.  Moreover, the si ze of the New England labor force has leveled off this year after se veral years of expansion.  And the labor force partic ipation rate, at least in Massachusetts, is down from  the rather high level of the mid- 1990s.  Both the slow growth in employment and the very low rate of regional unem ployment, which is fully 1-1/3 percentage points below the national rate, probably reflect the same phenomenon, at least in pa rt--that there aren’t  58many more workers to go around.  This ought to be cau sing wages to rise and to some extent it is.  Manufacturers and retailers report  2 to 5 percent base wage in creases, though manufacturers are granting much higher wages to employees with sought-after skills.  Temporary firms also report higher wages, in the range of 10 to  30 percent above last year, acro ss a wide range of professions.  Measures of local inflation continue to reflect a higher rate of increase  than in the nation as a whole.  In particular, energy costs, both oil and natural gas,  rose at better than a 15 percent pace from July 1999 to July 2000.  Housing prices as  well are up at rates surpassing those of th e nation, especially in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, with prices in  metro Boston rising at bett er than 15 percent.   A recent experience provides at least one reflec tion of this local trend.  I host a monthly breakfast with 8 to 10 more or less randomly ch osen employees.  The discussion centers around the challenges employees face at the Bank and issues they believe are of concern.  And it follows whatever direction the employees wa nt to take it.  The specifics ha ve varied over time, but this time there was some focus on prices and rising costs.  The question, to quote one employee, was:  “Why does everyone say inflation is not a problem when the costs of many of  the things I care most about--medical care, housing, public transportation, gasolin e, heating oil, and ed ucation--are all rising rapidly?”  Now this may have been a play for a higher wage increase [laught er] but I don’t think it was so specific.  It was a generalized concern a nd the rest of the people in the room seconded the sentiment. Of course, if we begin to see more of an economic slowing, perhaps some of the pressure will come off.  We’ve just completed our usual round of fall bankers’ forums, three programs in Maine, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.  A primar y question I asked of everyone I talked to was whether or not activity in their area was slowing down.  Answers varied, but the largest share of bankers believed that strong growth was contin uing and that competition, if anything, was more  59intense.  Others, however, were seeing some pu llback in residential construction and mortgage lending.  In sum, the New England region may well be  slowing, but the process is gentle to say the least and, depending on the area and i ndustry, perhaps imperceptible.   Turning to the national scene, signs of slowing may be a bit more evident than they are in New England, but the data here are mixed as  well.  Employment growth is slower, the unemployment rate is up a tick, and housing measures  are off their recent highs.  But confidence is high.  Home buying conditions are better, given recent mortgage trends.  Retail sales and other signs of consumption seem to have bounced back in the late summer.  The stock market seems to have bought the idea of an economic slowdown, and earni ngs warnings are more and more common.  Corporate leverage is growing.  At the same time, credit markets seem to be distinguishing among borrowers, with spreads rising for lower quality credit.  Tighter fi nancial conditions are likely a healthy development, however.  And profits, while slowing, are doing so from very healthy second-quarter levels.   Looking forward, the Greenbook projects what could only be viewed as nirvana: continued domestic strength, no part icular external drag, growing ra tes of structural productivity, a slight rise in unemployment, but largely quies cent inflation into 2002.  But this forecast seems surrounded by more than the usual sense of uncertainty.  I think that is reflect ed in the fact that it took 13 alternative simulations!  [Laughter]  They we re great, but there were  a lot of them!  The stock market could be weaker or stronger, oil pri ces higher or lower, the do llar stronger or weaker, and the fiscal stimulus greater.  But variations in two factors seem to make the most significant difference in the forecast, in the face of continue d relatively strong domestic demand.  And these, of course, are the measurements of supply: structural  productivity growth and ch anges in the level of resource utilization consistent with stable infl ation over the medium term --that is, the NAIRU.   60Forecasting with lower structural productivity growth gets higher inflation.  In fact, on the basis of our own forecast in Boston we would argue that ther e is a possibility at least that demand will not slow as much as is shown in this lower productivity  alternative, and inflati on could well rise quite a bit in that scenario.  On the other hand, with a lower NAIRU, we could ge t significantly slower inflationary growth.   So what are we to make of all of this un certainty?  Well, to me, common sense suggests that in the face of uncertainty we should be cau tious both in what we do and in what we say.  Moreover, while there are a lot of f actors at play, a few things seem indisputable in the short run.  Labor markets are tight.  Domes tic demand may be slowing but remains robust.  And world demand is growing as well, with the inevitable impact on th e external sector for us.  Rising productivity may well save the day, but it seems unlikely that in flation will go down any time soon and it may well escalate.  That, I think, should be  our primary concern.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy of the Ninth District remains healthy, but I think there are si gns of moderating activ ity.  On the positive side, labor markets continue to be very tight.  The ag ricultural sector is doi ng better than expected, mainly because crops are turning out to be very larg e.  The mining and energy sector s are expanding.  And while the picture in construction--both resi dential and nonresid ential--is mixed, overall I think activity in that sector has probably leveled off at a relatively high level.  The major area of slowing appears to be in consumer spending, and I’ll come back to that in a minute. As far as the nation is concerned, I think the outlook remains positive.  Our projections are for a continuation of significant real growth through 2002, although at a pace somewhat below the Greenbook forecast.  And we have inflation stabilizing, albeit at a bit higher rate than our former  61forecast.  What is new, at least to me, is what I’ ve been hearing anecdotally from retailers and from analysts who follow retailers.  They are reporting a significant slowing in c onsumer spending or at least disappointing sales over the la st several months.  Now, this in formation is anecdotal; it’s not a scientific sample.  There may be a lot of noise in it, but I don’t doubt  the sincerity of the reports, in the sense that retailers do seem to be greatly di sappointed with what they have seen recently.  And this is from some fairly significant players in the retail sector.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Mr. Chairman, the Se cond District’s economy has continued to expand at a moderate  pace since my last report, while consumer price inflation has remained subdued in the face of ongoing, though diminish ing, cost pressures.  After adjusting for the Verizon strike, private sector j ob growth accelerated noticeably in August to a more than 3 percent annual rate, though the reduction of Census workers appears to have  boosted the unemployment rate slightly.  Retail sales apparently turned sluggi sh again in mid-September following a brief pickup early in the month, while retail prices remained vi rtually flat.  Our sources  are giving virtually the same story that President Stern ju st described of a noticeable slowi ng in retail sales and considerable concern about the holiday season. While New York City’s office market remain s extremely tight, residential real estate third quarter, although some of this slowing, especia lly in northern New Jersey, seems to reflect land and labor constraints.  Home pri ces in New York City are up 10 to  15 percent from a year ago but that represents a slight decelerat ion, and unit sales continue to decline.  Housing markets in upstate New York are mixed but on balance improving.  Purc hasing managers in the region report continued growth in manufacturing activity, with some diminuti on in price pressures in September.  And local  62banks report a continuation of r ecent trends: weakening loan dema nd, tightening credit standards, and falling delinquency rates--a banking supervisor’s dream. We think the national economy is slowing ju st as monetary polic y tightening by this Committee intended it to slow.  We share the view that energy cost s will not cause great damage.  My own view is that the forwar d markets are not accurately reflec ting the increased supply that will result from the increased investment taking place, as President Hoenig described for his District.  If I am right and therefore energy prices  begin to trail off af ter the winter in the Northern Hemisphere, that should bring energy prices dow n just about in time to avoid what I think is the considerable risk of the higher energy prices increas ing inflation expectations.   Our research indicates that the productivity re volution is continuing a nd is spreading more broadly to the many users of technology.  And, ther efore, we agree with the Greenbook’s view and perhaps are even more optimistic.  I also believe that our economy has now demonstrated for long enough an ability to operate with an unemployment rate at or near  4 percent that we can presume that it is likely to continue to do so for at l east a while.  Our growth forecast has the economy expanding below potential, which we put at 4-1/2 percent per annum.  We think the present stance of monetary policy is just where it should be.  As we get into next year I thin k there will be a question as to whether our assessment of the balance of risks will have to be shifted.  But for the present I believe that the formal statement that the balance of risks is toward inflation continues to be the correct one.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Mr. Chairman, as I wander aroun d my District, I alwa ys ask the question “What’s new?”  And the answer is not much.  It seems to be pretty much steady as she goes.  I recently had a trip to Jefferson City, which is obviously not a very big market.  The overall  63unemployment rate there is  around 2 percent and the big issue in that area is a new one for them--the importation of Mexican workers.  A nd I think that example is one of many that we could cite of just how important the strength in our labor market ha s been for improving the a llocation of resources in both the labor and capital markets.  We certainly wa nt to do everything we po ssibly can to keep that going, and that is why maintaining stabilit y on the inflation front is critical.   I do have one issue with Pres ident Jordan.  Jerry, entertai nment spending for sports may be a problem in Cleveland, but it is doing just fine in St. Louis!  [Laughter]  My UPS contact was not available this time, but my FedEx contact said that his firm continues to see very strong dema nd with the exception of heavy freight, which goes by truck.  And that observation ties in with the information we have on the auto industry and the trucking industry; we know that sector has slowed a bit.  So that re port simply confirms what we are aware of from other sources.  Overall, the situation is fairly steady according to my FedEx contact.  International business continues to be very r obust, growing by 15 to 20 percent ye ar over year.  And it’s strong not only for shipments into the United States but al so for outbound shipments.  In fact, he said there has been a pickup in U.S. outbound shipments.  A nd UPS business is very robust within foreign economies, particularly in Asia, which would suggest  that economic activity ab road is continuing to do very well.  FedEx continues to have difficulty a ttracting entry-level workers; that is a problem we hear about over and over again.  And FedEx still sees significant compensation pressures at the professional levels.  But company managers ar e convinced that productivity improvements are covering those costs, so they don’t see them pa ssing through to their prices.  The exception, of course, is fuel.  FedEx has put on fuel surcharg es and its customers have accepted the surcharges without complaint.  It’s just a fact of business, and those added costs are being passed through with no difficulty.  64On the national picture, I would simply like to emphasize that the energy price increases really are impacting a lot of people.   Of course, the rise in the a ggregate CPI over the past 12 months is now running around 3-1/2 percent; th at is up a lot.  It’s driven almost entirely by energy but that still involves a very significant adjustment for pe ople from what they were seeing previously.  So I want to emphasize that one shouldn’t read energy out  of the CPI and say everything is just fine, as some commentators seem to do--tho ugh I don’t think that’s true of t hose around this table.  I believe that we really do have to pay attention to the aggregate CPI when the increase has been as long-standing and as persistent as this increase is becoming now. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Us ing what I’ll call a level test, I think that overall monetary policy is rough ly in balance.  With real inte rest rates in the neighborhood of 4 percent, minimal term premiums, and a core inflati on rate of about 2 percent, the equilibrium funds rate should be in the neighborhood of 6 percent.  A dding in a slight premium to cover the balance of risks leads to the present funds rate of 6-1/2 pe rcent, a rate that seems about right for today’s conditions.  Perhaps the biggest question is whether we should e liminate our upward bias.  One could argue for that by noting that the prospective growth of final demand really has slowed quite sharply from earlier in the year.  At this rate, it may not be too long before I join Tom Hoenig in thinking that the risks have become evenly balanced.  Yet at this point I thi nk that such a change in our posture is still premature.  I still believe that the fundamental risks of in flation are on the up side and I would like to retain  our present policy stance at least for a while. I have reached that conclusion for five reasons.  Let me try to give them quickly.  One is prudence.  In this day when fiscal policymak ers seem to be throwing prudence to the wind, somebody has to stress limits and the importance of stable prices.  That may as well be us.  The  65second is NAIRU.  I have often mentioned my su spicion that NAIRU coul d be as low as the 4 percent featured in the Greenbook si mulation.  I do like the outcome of  that simulation and I think it is at least somewhat likely.  But a suspicion that  NAIRU is low is not the same as proof, and the better part of valor says that we should move cau tiously before effectively rejecting the standard estimate of NAIRU.  Third is invest ment.  There is still a very strong investment boom in progress.  Historically when investment has been this strong for this long, inflation has ensued.  I suspect it proof.  Fourth is productivity.  To the extent th at wages have lagged the productivity change, there has been downward pressure on unit labor costs,  upward pressure on the dollar, and downward pressure on import prices.  But as wages catch up to the productivity increase--an event that seems likely at some point--many of the in flation-reducing benefits of the productivity shock could erode.  The last reason is energy.  We’ve ta lked about that plenty and I won’ t elaborate, but it’s certainly an upside risk. In all these ways I think the f undamental risks of inflation ar e still on the up side.  In the long run I believe our operational answer to this set of circumstances is forward-looking, flexible, inflation targeting, a type of approa ch I’ve tried to describe in previous meetings.  In the shorter run, in terms of what we should do today,  I have a shorter answer: no change. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like  others, my read of the incoming data is that they do point mainly to a continued modera tion in economic growth to a pace that I believe is below the economy’s potential.  In addition to the economic data that have come in, I think the more forward-looking indicators of real  activity also support the notion of  some slowing in train.  The purchasing managers’ report for new orders is the mo st recent example in that category.  Also, as I  66believe Peter Fisher was suggesting, the financ ial markets, though not unambiguously, certainly do seem to be consistent with a slowing.  They obviou sly have some concern about its pace, but I think they are suggesting a slowing is in train. Now having said that, the Greenbook and the econo mic data point to a number of risks.  One we’ve already talked about, which is oil.  Li ke Ned Gramlich, I will restrain myself on that subject except to observe that the one thing we ha ven’t talked about is the great risk of an upside price surprise that comes from eith er political instability or willful  misbehavior on the part of some of the producers of oil.  I think th at is still a possibili ty.  Though it doesn’t appear to be the most likely outcome, it’s one we do have to be aware of.   The second risk that I see in the forecast is that the Greenbo ok assumes that investment in productivity-enhancing capital goods will continue unabated even as credit conditions tighten and the pace of growth slows.  Given the role that the supply side of the economy has played for the last several years and the observation that no economy seems to have managed to sustain productivity increases in the high single digits for several years, this is to me  a very important assumption.  It rests on the view that a large chunk of investment spending con tinues to be done by established firms with relatively strong credit ratings who are likely to emerge from  this mild cyc lical slowing in very good shape.  While it is true that most capita l spending, at least among the largest companies, is done by investment grade firms, about a quarter of it is done by firms that are not investment grade.  So I see some potential risks there that we should be mindful of.  I would also observe that we’ve seen some negative earnings surprises from some  of the major participants in the new economy, including Cisco Systems which builds routers th at are the backbone for the Internet, Apple Computer, and Intel.  That goes back to the se miconductor story.  None of those stories is yet enough to say that this new economy, productivity-e nhancing supply shock we’ve had is over.  But I  67think we do have to be mindful th at there is at least a risk that the pace of investment in this expansion may slow, which would lead to unfor tunate outcomes with re spect to productivity, employment, and also inflation--a  combination of developments that would be challenging for us. In a more positive sense of risk, I was glad to  see that the staff included an alternative simulation with a NAIRU at 4 percent.  Like Ne d Gramlich, I’ve certainly toyed with the possibility of a low NAIRU in that area.  In the time I’ve been here at the Board we’ve had unemployment running somewhere between 4.3 and 3.9 percent and infl ation has been quite qu iescent, partially for special factors.  Nevertheless, it does leave open the possibility that in fact the so-called NAIRU is down at that level.  I find it inst ructive that the staff at least seems to think the probability of a NAIRU at that lower level is about 20 percent, more or less.  Again, I think it’s too early to presume that’s the answer and too early to  base policy on it.  But it’s inte resting that we can even have a discussion where the possibility of  NAIRU at around 4 to 4-1/4 percen t is definitely on the table. When I put all of these certainties and uncer tainties together, it seems to me as though the best policy stance for now is steady as she goes.  A slowing does seem to be well under way, not requiring any further action.  I do th ink that the balance of risk statement should continue to be focused on inflation.  We have tight labor markets.  There is some uncertainty about oil.  The fiscal policy situation is a little un certain.  And if it turns out that the economy can maintain noninflationary growth at an unemployment rate as low as today’s, then a gradual policy will allow us to discover that truth over time as well.  S o, I believe we should stand pat as we are and just continue to monitor incomi ng data as we have been.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will focus my remarks this morning on what I view as the three key themes in the Greenbook forecast.  While David Stockton has already  68emphasized the considerable uncertain ty that attaches to each of th em, these themes are consistent with the qualitative aspect s of my own view of the outlook.  Firs t, the economy appears to be making a transition from above-trend to below-trend growt h.  Second, the balance of risks is nevertheless toward rising core inflation.  And this risk not only persists throughout the forecast period; it will likely remain for a considerable period of time thereaf ter.  Third, if oil pri ces decline over the next two years, consistent with expectations in futures prices, overall consumer price inflation will likely decline next year and the upward drift in core inflation will be significantly restrained over the forecast period.   The balance of risks toward higher inflation, even if grow th remains modestly below trend, reflects an assessment that the prevailing unemployment rate is below the short-run NAIRU and the prospect that the short-run NAIRU will rise as productivity growth stabi lizes, or at least rise at a slower rate than over the last several year s.  The upward pressure on core inflation in the Greenbook comes from the gap betw een the prevailing unemployment rate and the staff’s 4-3/4 percent estimate of the short-r un NAIRU.  The staff projects no in crease in the short-run NAIRU over the forecast period.  And a subsequent convergence toward the long-run NAIRU would presumably be a source of continuing infl ation pressure beyond th e forecast period.   There have been already many well deserv ed compliments to the authors of the Greenbook, but I can’t resist noting that no member of this Committ ee has a greater appreciation for their careful analysis of the unemployment rate relative to the short-r un NAIRU and the long-run NAIRU than I do.  Of course, the staff took no chan ces in this Greenbook.  W ith all the alternative simulations, including the one with a 4 percent long-run NAI RU, there was something for everybody.  And that’s a good thing, I’m sure.   69The first two themes in the Greenbook story, be low-trend growth and rising core inflation, are features of what I have called a “reverse so ft landing.”  There is a transition to growth at potential from an initial point above potential via a period of below-trend growth.  During the transition demand pressure results in an upward tr end for core inflation unless other supply shocks intervene.  So while many outside and some insi de the FOMC will regret a slowdown to below-trend growth, I continue to believe that  such a reverse soft landing is the most benign outcome possible, given my assessment of the relationship betw een actual and potentia l output today.   The earlier period of above-trend growth and d eclining core inflation and the projection of below-trend growth and rising inflation over the for ecast period are, in my view, two sides of the economy's adjustment to the acceleration in prod uctivity growth.  Initia lly, an acceleration in productivity yields a powerful disinflationary impetus.  It may allow a decline in both unemployment and inflation.  That is the bright side of the adju stment to the acceleration of productivity that we have enjoyed for the last four or five years.   It has offered policymakers a choice among only favorable outcomes: temporarily lower unemployment, lower inflation, or some combination.  Now the time may have arrived wh en we have to face the other side of that adjustment.  When the temporary disinflationary impetus of the pr oductivity gains dissipates, the demand pressure at the prevailing unemployment ra te will begin to show th rough to higher unit labor costs and inflation unless, of c ourse, productivity growth continue s to rise aggressively enough to postpone that adjustment.   On the other side of the adjustment proce ss we face a less favorable set of choices--some combination of below-trend growth and rising core  inflation, as in the Greenbook, until output is realigned with potential.  The clos er growth is to poten tial during this part of the adjustment, the sharper will be the cumulative rebound in inflati on.  The staff forecast does, nevertheless, offer a  70very benign outcome over the next 2-1/2 years.  The key assumptions that contribute to that benign outcome are that oil prices decline over most of  the forecast period and that a tighter monetary policy prevents a premature rebound in growth to or beyond trend as long as there is upward pressure on core inflation. The result is steady growth  at a rate more than 50 percent higher than the average of the 20 plus years prior to the mid-1990s, with an average unemployment rate still close to the lowest over the last 30 years an d still modest rates of overall inflation.  This is not as good as the experience during the bright side of the adjustment process, but it would still be a pretty impressive next chapter in this expansion.   While I appreciate the uncertainty about the estimate of both the short-run and the long-run NAIRU, the Greenbook forecast and analysis high lights the risks of higher inflation that may still remain, even if the economy slips into an extended period of  below-trend growth.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kelley. MR. KELLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chai rman.  Over time it has seemed to me that there is a certain recurring rhythm to the work of this Comm ittee.  There are times when we are faced with a need to reassess the appr opriate fundamental course of policy and other times when we are focused on questions of how much impetus may or may not be needed to move further along an established path.  And then there are occasions when an inte rmediate-term objective appears to be being met, which raises a new set of issues and puts us into a period when it is desirable to wait and see what incoming data tell us about evolvi ng conditions.  We may be in su ch a wait-and-see period today.  We now appear to be in an economic slowdown, which most if not all of us have been seeking.  And new questions present themselves:  How long-lasti ng and how deep will this slowdown prove to be?  How will the course of inflation react?  Will inflation slow with the economy, continue to creep upward regardless, or perhaps accel erate in response to conditions  previously in place?  Many  71scenarios have a certain plausibil ity, but I believe the Greenbook base line is as good a bet as one can make today, and it calls for a wait-and-see approach fo r now.  I believe that represents the rhythm of the day and, therefore, that the pres ent policy stance remains appropriate. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Than k you very much.  Don Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN .  Mr. Chairman, at its last two meetings, the Committee kept the  stance of policy unchanged, but expresse d concern that the risks going forward were tilted toward higher inflation.  The information you’ve received since and that policy can again be left on hold.  As a number of you remarked, incoming data have tended to confirm th at the growth of aggregate demand has slowed to, or even a bit below, the rate  of growth of the economy’s potential.  Moreover, developments in financial markets have been consistent with a projection of relatively moderate grow th going forward.  While long-term rates have declined on net since May, the full effects of the leveling out of equity prices this year have yet to be felt, an d the dollar has continued to appreciate.  Increasing caution by lenders, especially  toward marginal credits, should reinforce the restraining effects of the ri se in interest rates over the last 18 months.  And in part because equity i nvestors appear to have become more cautious as well, stock prices have been held down even as long-term interest rates have backed off.  Growth of M2 has picked up very recently, but that followed two months of ve ry sluggish expansion and on average in the third quarter M2 decelerated notic eably from earlier in the year.  In credit markets, lower long-term interest rates have enc ouraged a shift in financing out on the yield curve, but private debt  growth appears to have slowed appreciably in the third quarter.    There has been less news over the intermeeting period about costs and prices than about economic activity, but the information becoming available in this area has not suggested that the prevailing degree of tightness in labor Core PCE inflation has ticked higher over the last year, but some of that small price acceleration likely represents the passthrough effects of higher energy prices.  And longer-term in flation expectations, whethe r measured in securities volatile oil prices have added an elem ent of uncertainty to the outlook for aggregate demand, potential supply, and underlying inflation--with possibly conflicting implications for the stance of  policy.  Under the circumstances, there would seem little to be lost  and potentially much to be gained by keeping policy unchanged at this meeting and awaiting cl earer signals about the evolution of economic activity and prices.          72Indeed, the Committee might see th e developments over the last intermeeting period as suggesting that the chances of inflation moving higher have receded--perhaps by enough to  bring the risks to achieving your macroeconomic objectives into balance for the foreseeable future.  The financial markets adopted a view that th e risks were balanced some time ago.  Indeed, more recently, market participants  would appear to be placing greater odds that the Committee will need to lower interest rates to cushion a softening in activity than that it will be requir ed to raise rates to contain emerging inflation pressures.    An important reason for the Comm ittee’s perception that inflation threatened to intensify has been a co ncern that the grow th of demand might outpace that of potential supply, furthe r tightening already strained labor with the additional restrain t still in the pipeline from previous tightenings, soggy equity markets, and a stronger dol lar, might make you now much more confident that aggregate de mand will grow no faster than potential output.  In the staff forecast, at an unchanged fe deral funds rate over the next year, pressures on resources gradually abate.  Decreases in long-term interest rates since this spring, along with profits warni ngs and equity price declines of late, tend to support the judgment expre ssed in the August Greenbook that to a considerable extent faster productivity  growth had already been built into interest rates and expected profits.  In that case, the economy would not be about to experience another round of th e demand-augmenting effects of greater growth in potential suppl y.  If the Committee therefore saw unemployment rates at or a little over 4 percent as likely to  persist, and you also saw such rates as reasonably likely to be consistent for so me time with stable  inflation, you might now judge the risks to achieving your objectives as balanced.   However, even if the Committee were fairly confident that pressures on resources would not intensify, you might st ill find that the balance of risks remained weighted toward higher inflati on.  Such a view is implied by the staff forecast, in which even with a gradua l uptrend in the unemployment rate and further increases in productivity growth, labor markets are tighter than can be sustained without inflation picking u p.  While the Committee might not be prepared to sign on to this assessment of labor market disequilibrium, you could still view the inflation risks around un employment rates in the low 4s as unbalanced.  Giving some wei ght to history might suggest  that if NAIRU is not in this neighborhood, it is more likely to be above than below it, especially once increases in productivity growth begin to abate.  Some measures of core inflation have picked up more than th e PCE index as unemployment rates have stayed around 4 percent ove r the last year, perhaps reinforcing a sense of unbalanced risks around prevailing levels  of labor resource utilization.  And with levels of core inflation now possi bly near, or even beyond, the limit that the Committee might find acceptable in the very long run, you might see any  73further acceleration of pr ices as adverse to economic performance over time, and a situation requiring an especially robust reaction.   Energy price developments also might contribute to a perception that risks remain skewed toward higher inflation.  St aff models tend to show that oil price shocks push both inflation and output away  from long-run desirable levels.   Over recent quarters, any tendency for hi gher oil prices to damp demand has not reduced actual output below potential, how ever, but rather has helped to bring about better balance between the growth of demand and potential supply.  In the context of still robust final demand and high resource utilization, any deterioration in inflation expectations as  a consequence of persistently higher energy prices would be troublesome.  A nd in the event inflation expectations rise, cushioning the effects of higher o il prices on labor and product markets by holding nominal rates unchanged and allo wing real rates to  fall would risk setting in motion an upward trend to th e inflation rate, rather than just an adjustment in the price level.  The unco mfortable reality is that a rise in oil prices requires a decline in domestic real  income to validate the transfer of purchasing power abroad and decrease in  economic efficiency.  Some added slack in labor markets may be necessary to prevent worker attempts to protect the purchasing power of thei r wages from resulting in an acceleration of costs and prices.  Keeping policy unchanged, whatever the bias in your announcement, leaves open the question of your strategy going forward.  The FOMC could find it difficult to tighten in a timely manner in  the event that the staff is right that underlying inflation is on a very gradual uptrend with output growth at or below the growth of potential supply.  Operati ng for a time with a prediction that inflation at a later date will be above your desired level is  not necessarily a problem, provided you act at some point  to forestall or reverse that development.  Uncertainty about key interactions in the economy is a good reason to wait.  However, with little  conviction on NAIRU and its empirical relationship to productivity acceleration over the interm ediate and longer runs, it becomes hard, if not impossible, to act  preemptively to prevent inflation from rising if indeed labor resour ces turn out to be stretche d too tight.  At the same time, you need to be careful not to fa ll into the trap of accepting a gradual updrift in inflation because the few tent hs each year could be noise and not unambiguous evidence that the economy is  operating at too high a level, and so do not seem to pose a clear danger to satisfactory economic performance.  Those few tenths will cumulate over time.  In the past, the Committee has tended to wait for convincing evidence that policy tightening was needed and then to act forcefully, but still well before actual inflation intensified.  This wa s the pattern in 1993-1994 and again over the last year and a half.  This strategy has carried w ith it a number of potential pitfalls.  The Committee could wait too l ong and hence need to do considerably more tightening than otherwise, lead ing to greater variations in output,  74employment, and inflation than desirable.   On the other end, aggressive policy actions once you begin to tighten could easily lead to overshooting.  Despite these pitfalls, the strategy has been  successful for a number of reasons.  Foremost, as in 1994 and again most r ecently, the Committee has acted at an early stage of the inflation process, in that it leaned against unsustainable growth in demand long before a pickup in inflation got going.  It has also been helpful that markets have been able to anticipate your actions, so the exact timing of your tightenings was not impor tant.  Finally, you have been flexible enough to stop tightening and even to roll back some of the actions promptly when overshooting looked likely.  The current situation, if inflation pr essures do intensify gradually, may not be as well suited to the strategy of wa iting for great conviction and then moving forcefully.  The risks you are now looki ng at are further along the transmission channel to inflation than the demand questions you faced before.  Given the uncertainties, a number of you have remark ed that in the current situation you will need to be more reactive than an ticipatory when it comes to judgments about the sustainability of  a particular level of unemployment.  Finally, you the past.  At this point, markets do no t see the risk you see.  If inflation pressures intensify gradually, markets may take longer than you would be comfortable with to reco gnize the problem and your need to address it.  The difficulties of making stabilizing monetary policy in the presence of supply-side uncertainties once growth rate  risk abates do not lend themselves to ready solutions.  Some economic theori es indicate you shoul d take your best guess on some of these key values and act  on those guesses, but this may not be appealing when the interactions are co mplex and the best guesses so diffuse. You may still be able to be preemptive, albeit to a much lesser degree, for example by paying close attention to busine ss cost structures for hints that price pressures are about to emerge.  And you may end up having to be more willing to surprise financial markets if you see pressures building and markets fail to heed your warnings.  Finally, you may need to care about the level of inflation as well as its change.  The evidence that a few tenths increase in inflation is part of a continuing trend may not need to be  quite as convincing when those tenths take core PCE inflation from 2 to 2-1/4 percent as when they raised the same measure from 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Don?  If not, considering th e late hour I’ll try either to say less or to speak faster  or some combination of the two! The members’ response to the latest Gree nbook suggests to me that everybody likes the alternative simulations presented there by the staff.   The trouble is that each simulation gives us a  75different forecast! The staff has covered the full spectrum of forces shaping the current outlook and indeed has given us, I think, a fairly  incisive view of the true range s of probabilities in a situation where something very unusual is happening. I’m not talking about the high-tech developments, which we have been discussing for quite a long pe riod of time.  We don't know  much more than we did earlier about those developments, but at leas t we think we are beginning to understand them.  The latest Greenbook has taken th e oil/energy problem and has s uperimposed it on the high-tech uncertainties. And, as a number of you have said, what we infer from that is that choosing the appropriate forecast is clearly quite problematic. So far as I can judge, there is nothing terrib ly significant going on in the economy excluding energy.  The productivity numbers still seem to be  accelerating modestly, but  the levels of actual output per hour have moved into a range where it's just  not credible that they can continue to rise and ultimately reflect still higher st ructural productivity in the areas where we’re already seeing large increases in current output per hour, even cyclically adjusted.  So one must be skeptical about those productivity numbers in the sense that it’s startling to see their second derivative remain positive after having been positive for so long. Moreover, that second deri vative has been a larger number than one would ordinarily expect.  Part of the problem is the flattening out of the statistical discrepancy, which has taken the official GDP-based  productivity data to a new high rate of growth whereas the income-based productivity estimates, specifically for nonfinancial corporations, have not shown the fairly pronounced changes that have o ccurred in the official data in the last year. The long-term forecasts of earnings by security analysts, as I have said before, are not an indication of the true forecast but largely reflect what corporate America thinks about its future. There is just no slowing in those forecasts for the longer term both for high-tech and for non high-tech firms, despite the fact that forecasts for the short term have turned quite disappointing and  76indeed have fostered some really  bizarre stock price movements among some of the larger and fairly well established high-tech firms.  The implication is that these companies are still finding projects in which to invest where they anticipate significant rates of return over the longer term. One does not see any significant diminution of that earni ngs outlook phenomenon, despite the fact that productivity increases have rise n to fairly elevated levels. The one thing I find somewhat of a concern here is that we are not getting in any of these views about the outlook for earnings the type of impact that substant ial energy price changes clearly must be having.  Don Kohn reflected on the increasi ng costs that clearly are there for business firms despite the fact that the intensity of energy usage is half what it was thirty years ago.  So we clearly are not looking at the type of envi ronment that we had in the past.  But remember that a goodly part of that very significant decline in energy inputs relative to real GDP had occurred by 1985 and yet there is no doubt that the Gulf War did have a si gnificant impact on economic activity, basically, as best we can judge, through its effects on consum er confidence.  The comments around this table indicate that consumer confiden ce is holding up very well, although th e revision of the University of Michigan numbers for September suggests a fairly sh arp deterioration in att itudes in the second half of the month.  I don’t know whether or not this is an aberration, but it's the first sign that any of our measures of consumer confidence have  run into trouble.  If in fact th at is what is happening, then the oil price-energy price phenomenon is really beginn ing to have an impact.  And indeed we are beginning to see some economic effects.  If we se parate high-tech from lo w-tech in the orders figures, which is how we tend to look at these numb ers, lo and behold low-tech is doing very well.  But it is doing very well because the surge in electr ic power capacity problems has led to some very substantial increases in orders for engines and turbines and rela ted backlogs that are having an impact in the economy.    77In any event, I think the crucial problem here rests fundamentally with oil and our interpretation of its role.  We ha ve seen over the years th at even though we tend to refer to oil as part of the old economy, it really is not .  If we look at the extraordinary technological advances that have occurred in the industry, they really are quite awes ome.  The capability of using seismic exploration to find oil has led to a major reduction in the cost of finding oil in any given oil extraction environment.  The ratio of dry holes to exploratory wells has come down dramatically.  The development of various deep and horizontal dri lling technologies has lowe red the real cost of extracting oil in a quite significant way.  If one merely looked at the under lying technologies and asked what was happening to the long-term margin al cost of finding new oil, clearly one would conclude that it has been coming dow n fairly dramatically as indeed it has outside the OPEC area. In fact, the ability of othe r producers to offset OPEC has been qu ite impressive until very recently.  Actually, until fairly recently OPEC production was remarkably flat for many years, obviously reflecting a slowdown in world dema nd associated with the reduction in  the intensity of oil usage but also, surprisingly, a signifi cant increase in the pro duction of non-OPEC oil. The difficulty that the non-OPEC oil countries are having is that the environment in which they have to seek and drill for oil is becoming increasingly less hos pitable. We may be getting lower costs for any given type of oil exploration and drilling environment, but if the environment is worsening one would expect, and indeed one sees, th at a significant part of  those cost improvements is being countermanded, so to speak.  Nonetheles s, until very recently the evidence that the long-term equilibrium price of oil was declining was r eally quite impressive. We have data on this, which is separate from the anecdotal repor ts of the oil companies.  Essentially the data show that the price trend in the futures market for oil,  specifically the long-term  or 3- to 6-year futures prices of West Texas Intermediate, was edging downward until very  recently. Two years ago, for example, prices in  78the futures markets would start at $12 a barrel and rise to $17 where they would flatten out for long-term contracts.  When spot prices rose, futures prices would go quite a b it higher for shorter-term contracts and then come down in  “backwardation,” flattening out  at $17 or $18 a barrel. This behavior suggested that, to the ex tent that the futures markets refl ect the true long-term marginal equilibrium price, the latter was somewhere in  the area of $17 or $18 a barrel, West Texas Intermediate equivalent. Because the oil industry has a nother very important character istic, in part I might add reflecting the advanced technology that it employs, it runs on very low usable  inventories.  Indeed, the latter might be described as cl ose to fumes but not qui te.  Ordinarily over the last decade or so, usable stocks of oil have supplied about 13 da ys of demand, down from earlier periods.  And because there is only a 13-day supply in the world market, we have an extraordinarily sensitive oil price structure.  Indeed, what we have seen historically is th at oil prices are ex tremely volatile and they are volatile in a very interesting way.  They sp ike.  We have had signif icant spikes all along the way and what this suggests is a very high in elasticity of response to changing demand. As a consequence, when OPEC was able in the spring of 1998 to bring its production level down by a fairly pronounced amount--they brought it down about 3 million barrels a day, which is a huge number--that effectively began to open up a significant gap between demand, which was rising gradually, and supply.  The 15-day suppl y of usable stock available at that time started to evaporate very rapidly.  That stock finally  got down to a 10-day supply and the spot price of crude, as you know, rose at a very rapid pace.  The effect was a very dramatic “backwardation” as they say in the time, the equilibrium price of oil probably di d not change very much even though longer-term futures added $2 or $3 per barrel, largely I suspec t because of uncertainties about the potential  79degree of excess world capacity over the long term. In this situation, it was very difficult to build inventories.  With the very substantial backward ation that occurred why w ould a refiner buy crude at $37 a barrel and as it was being re fined find out two months later th at it was worth $3 or $4 a barrel less?  So inventories were not being built up anywhere in the system, and indeed they were kept at extremely low levels, thereby exaggerating the pri ce acceleration.  Finally,  OPEC was induced to raise their production quite significantly. We did see the pickup in  inventories that one would expect. When the gap between supply and demand closed, th e decline in inventorie s initially slowed, and stocks then started to turn up.   There is an interesting oddity in the recen t data. Domestic demand for oil products is accelerating and production is going up ve ry dramatically. This raises the interesting question as to whether or not the domestic shipment numbers reflect what is actually happening to demand. Remember, those numbers cover shipments from re fineries and the primary inventory complex and do not reflect the buildup in inventories either at re tail gasoline service stations or more importantly at homes in the form of heating oil. All this is very  suggestive of the prob ability that underlying demand is not accelerating but that inventories, becau se they cannot be held at the refinery level without potential loss, are beginning to  increase at the tertia ry level.  Indeed, if we look at the United States, and this is true elsewhere,  the demand for distillate fuel ha s risen exceptionally rapidly in the last two or three months.  In fact, in comparison with a year ago, it probably is up the equivalent of perhaps 300,000 or 400,000 barrels above the normal daily  average in the United States.  What this suggests is that there has been a massive run by the American public to  buy home heating oil.  They are not using it yet.  It  is not winter!  So wh ere is it going?  Inventor ies are going up in all the secondary storage areas. So, the presumption that th ere is a home heating oil shortage is something that only people who don't watch the markets believe.  This has been the most publicized shortage in  80recent memory, which is a guarantee that it is no t happening!  And indeed the presumed shortage raises some very interesting questions about the outlook for oil because, seasonally adjusted, we are seeing a very dramatic increase in aggregate world inventory accumulation currently.  Without seasonal adjustment, one ordinarily would expect world inventories to contract in the fourth quarter, and the evidence at this point is that they are not.  OPEC production has gone up over 3 million barrels a day, possibly even more than that, and is  now much higher than it s level before the OPEC-engineered price acceleration.   So part of the answer to the question of what is holding oil pr ices where they are is that capacity is very restrained.  There is very little in  the way of surplus capacity in the system.  Leaving the inventory issue aside, there is  the risk of a spike that is cr eating major speculative buying in the crude market and in the product markets.  And, as  was mentioned before, there is a very serious concern that Iraq, which is producin g 2-1/2 to 3 million barrels a day, may suddenly decide that they are having a production problem.  If we take a chunk of crude that bi g out of the world system, that could do wonders to oil prices because outside of Iraq there is just a littl e more than one million barrels a day left in available world production cap acity.  If there are any breakdowns anywhere they could create some serious problems.  But what is ha ppening here is that leve ls of production are high because the demand for inventories has surged, as re flected in both the published primary data and in the unpublished tertiary data.  The consequence has to be a real inve ntory bloat.  It is unclear how all this is going to work out because the inventory problem could disappear if Saddam decides that he has enough cash and doesn't need any more money from  oil sales, or we could have a variety of breakdowns.  In sum, it is very difficult to fo recast the price of oil.  The one thing we are pretty sure of, if history is any guide, is that if we get another spike it will reverse itself provided that we can get  81through this winter, get through th e threats coming from Iraq, and hope fully the Middle East does not go berserk.  There are a lot of uncertainties  in the outlook for oil that, depending on their resolution, can fundamentally alter the overall course of the economy. T hose uncertainties have to be changing the structure of our capita l stock, making it somewhat less effi cient.  They must be creating negatives that we really don't r ecognize and don’t get picked up or have never been picked up by our econometric models.  Simulate the 1973 experience,  the 1979 experience, th e Gulf War experience, and I will bet that your results will not produce th e recessions that actually occurred.  What this suggests is an asymmetric impact of the oil and en ergy price effect.  Remember, natural gas is a big problem.  Electric power is a big problem.  So this  is not a situation akin to the old environment where coal was able to keep the cost of electri c power down.  We have a whole series of problems here.  We may very readily agree that the most li kely forecast is the one right in the middle of the Greenbook. It tells us that everything will be just fi ne.  But these markets are really very tricky and the presumption that everything is going to wo rk out well is still, in my judgment, a hope. As a consequence, as far as policy is concer ned the general consensus around the table, and in my judgment the right one, is to do nothing today.  But the risks clearly remain on the up side as far as inflation is concerned largely because of th e energy difficulties that we have discussed.  Even though I recognize all the arguments that were made  with regard to produ ctivity, the NAIRU, and the assumption of accelerating unit labor  costs, they clearly reflect risk s that suggest we have to be fairly vigilant in our assessment of developm ents bearing on the intermediate economic outlook.

I would like to point out, though, that if we were using the ol d directive language I think there would be a case for symmetry.  In my view there is about equal probability that the next move would be up or down.  But the danger with trying to read that interpretation into the cu rrent language is that the market would interpret a balanced risk statement--if we were  to go to that--as saying that we  believe the inflation picture has become more benign, which I do not think is the cas e.  I think it is also worth emphasizing that historically oil shocks have had particular even ts behind them. We had the Suez Canal closure in 1956.  We had the coalescence of OPEC in 1973.  Th e Shah of Iran was deposed in 1979 and there was the Gulf War in 1990-91.  The current case do es not have any incident of that type.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Well, let me co mment about that.  I think we  have always understood that monopolies make prices high.  They do not make pri ces rise.  And there is no question that in the face of strong demand it is in the interest of a monopoly to exploit a strong demand to raise prices.

MR. POOLE.  I agree that there is an inventory cycle that is  very hard to understand.  By inventories I mean the inventories th at are invisible and that we don't have any direct data on.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. MR. FERGUSON.  I support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman.  I’d also like to make one comment.  I think Don Kohn did us a great service by getting us focused on this creeping inflation issue. I’m not quite sure what the answer is but I think we will come back to it.  I heard Jerry Jordan also raise some  concern about this issue.

I do, too!  [Laughter] MR. KOHN.  It will be hard to write the minutes! CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Will you read the appropriate language?  85

[SECTION]

MR. GILLUM.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I will be  reading from page 11 of the Bluebook. The directive wording is:  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable gr owth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of  around 6-1/2 percent.” Now, the balance-of-risks sentence:  “Again st the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth a nd of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.”

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  As you all know, we ha ve received the ini tial installment of the SOMA study and Tom Simpson is here to brief us on it. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Do you want to look at the announcement first? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I am terribly sorry,  yes!  I took a look at the clock and

MR. PARRY.  It sounds good! CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I presume that silence indicates acceptance? SEVERAL.  Yes.   CHAIRMAN GREENSP AN.  Tom Simpson. 

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON.  Carol is passing out some mate rials that I will refer to in my remarks.2 Last week, you were sent two papers representing the first installment in the Committee’s wide-ranging SOMA project .  The other parts of this broad effort--covering selection criteria for alternative Federal Reserve assets, potential alternative market instrument s, and the role fo r the discount window--will be discussed at the next couple FOMC meetings.       The first paper sent last week cont ains forecasts of the federal budget surplus going out a number of years, along with accompanying expectations for the contraction of the stock of Treasury de bt and rise in the System’s share of that dwindling stock.  The second examines the recent performance of the Treasury securities market and pros pects for that market, including the System’s ability to conduct operations in Treasury securities going forward.  I would now like to summarize briefly our  findings, using the handout containing exhibits from those papers.  The upper panel of your first exhibit illu strates forecasts of the cumulative surplus in the federal budget over the coming decade under different scenarios for fiscal policy and assumptions for ec onomic growth.  The three solid lines illustrate outcomes under three fiscal scenarios and the middle path for real output growth--4-1/2 percent per year, the Board staff’s assessme nt of structural output growth in the current year.  Fiscal  policy A represents a current services path, and does not allow for any discre tionary adjustments of tax or spending policy to rising underlying surpluses.  Fiscal policy B is based on future Congresses and presidents using  the on-budget portion to finance tax cuts and spending initiatives, but not to touch the corresponding off-budget portion--an outcome that seems to have gained fairly widespread support recently.  The third fiscal policy, policy C, goes beyond B and allows workers to devote two percentage points of their Social Secur ity payroll taxes to private retirement accounts.  One does not need to buy into the specifics of a ny of these fiscal alternatives but rather to regard them  as proxies for a range of plausible outcomes.  The paper also considers alte rnative output paths based on structural                                                            2 A copy of the two staff papers, distributed to the Committee on September 27 and 29, 2000, have been placed in Committee files.  A copy of the exhibits used by Mr . Simpson during his briefing is  appended to this transcript.  (Appendix 2)  87growth being a percentage point higher and a percentage point lower than the  4-1/2 percent middle case.  The effects of these alternativ e output paths are shown in the upper and lower ends of the shaded portions of the chart.         As you can see from the chart, the cu mulative surpluses continue to rise under all of the possibilities contemplat ed in this study.  The bottom panel translates these surpluses into paydown s of marketable debt.  Under fiscal policy B and the middle path for output  growth, cumulative surpluses reach about $3 trillion by 2010, and would leave only about $1/2 trillion of outstanding marketable Treasury debt in that year.     To get a sense of what these projections  imply for System operations in the Treasury securities market, we also fo recasted the System’s balance sheet under the alternative paths for the economy.  A numb er of factors affect  the size of the System’s balance sheet at any point in tim e, such as the behavior of reservable deposits and the Treasury’s cash balance at the Fed.  But over time the System’s balance sheet has been driven by the dema nd for currency, and we expect this to continue going forward.  Using our proj ections for reserves and currency, the top panel of your second exhi bit illustrates the path of System ownership of Treasury debt under the current limit on per-issue holdings, which amounts to approximately a 25 percent share of mark etable Treasury debt.  Under fiscal policy B and the middle output path, the System’s holdings would reach that limit in about three years, and thereafte r the System would need to liquidate Treasuries as total outstandings fell--ab sent, of course, an upward revision to the limit.  The middle panel illustrate s that, under these assumptions, System holdings of other assets begin to build fa irly rapidly starting in three years, and by 2010 would account for more than 80 percent of System assets.  These dates could be brought still closer by additi onal dollarization abroad and the payment of interest on required reserves, which would boost our liabilities and assets.  Thus, the time for the System to be ready to adopt alternatives to Treasury securities for supplying a permanent sour ce of reserves to the banking system does not seem very far off.  Treasury securities have served the Sy stem’s needs, and those of a wide variety of other holders, extremely well,  given their very high liquidity and unrivaled safety.  Moreover, the asso ciated well-developed RP market in Treasury securities has been important for temporary System transactions.  However, the large swing in the fede ral budget from deficit to surplus has already had a notable effect on the Treasury market, prompting various adjustments by the Desk.  The third exhib it is intended to br oadly represent the performance of the Treasury securities ma rket over recent years.  It shows bid-ask spreads quoted in the interdealer market in bi lls, the upper panel, and coupons, the lower panel.  There has been  an upward drift in this measure, which suggests a general erosion of liqui dity in virtually all sectors of the Treasury debt market.  Over this period, some notable disturbances have sent bid-ask spreads soaring, such as the fina ncial market turmoil in the fall of 1998,  88but these have been followed by partial r ecoveries, in part owing to adaptations by market participants and the Desk .  Looking ahead, the kind of steady contraction in Treasury securities that we  foresee is likely to be accompanied by further erosion in the depth and liquidity  of that market and greater volatility and vulnerability to shocks.  As noted, the Desk, in response to oc casional disturbances in the Treasury securities market and the general deteri oration of liquidity and depth, has taken various steps to relieve pressures on the Treasury securities and RP markets and to facilitate its daily operations.  These have included suspending bill purchases in 1998 and 1999, dividing coupon purchases in to more tranches and spreading them over weeks or months, broadening th e pool of RP collateral, and imposing limits on acquisitions of Treasury securitie s in auctions and in the secondary to continue to conduct a considerable volume of operations  in the Treasury securities market.  Over time, though, thes e transactions will be done at greater cost and with a greater impact on Treasury securities market, and at some point the System will need to cut back on transactions in this market and begin to rely on alternatives.    Finally, I have attached a list of  System staff members who have participated in this po rtion of the overall project.  Thank you.      

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions  for Tom?  Governor Gramlich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Tom, on Exhibit 2--and let me stick to fiscal policy B just for the sake of simplicity--in the top panel you basically worked that off the budget forecast and the 25 percent limit to compute our Treasury holdings? 

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON.  Right. MR. GRAMLICH.  Then in the bottom two panels you put that together with your estimates of currency demand to compute what othe r assets have to be on the balance sheet to finance the currency demand and make this all wor k.  So it is a combination of your fiscal policy assumptions and your currency assumptions, right?  89

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON.  Yes.  Actually, the middle pa nel is more of a mirror image of the upper panel.  What we have done in the upper panel is to forecast the stock of Treasury debt and also the growth in our balance sheet, which has been dr iven almost mainly by currency demand.    

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Okay.  Anyway, these two th ings are going on:  We have declining Treasury debt, of which we are taking a share, an d we have rising currency demand.  So then we have these alternative assets that have to get huge in a few year s.  I take it what you're telling us is that we don't yet know what these alte rnative assets are.  Is that fo r other parts of the study?  That was my question.  I kept looking for that [laughter]  and I assume that's your next installment. 

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON.  Right.  This project was br oken up into several pieces.  We thought the first step was to get some idea of what the Treas ury market is going to lo ok like and what kinds of constraints we are going to face if we choose to con tinue to rely on that market in the coming years.  And the tough stuff is yet to come! 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  The fun stuff is still to come! 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  This tells you how big the animal  behind door No. 2 is.  It just doesn't tell you what the animal is! 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I know!  I think we all know it's a big animal.  I just wondered whether it has stripes or spots. 

[SECTION]

MR. SIMPSON.  We're not saying that yet! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry. MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, I think this information is very helpful and certainly provides a good grounding for what is to come.  A nd I am sure that is going to be extremely interesting and also challenging.  First, I was w ondering if we know anything about the lead times we would have in terms of being able to look at  the material prior to discussing it.  Secondly, I  90wondered whether time would be set aside so that we can discuss this in an environment that may be slightly more leisurely than, say, afte r an FOMC meeting and before lunch. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, we can replicate what Bill McDonough was suggesting for the December meeting at so me point.  This is important enough.   

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  This is one of the more signif icant issues we will have to deal with. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Of course the new administration and the Congress may take the issue out of our hands and make it all moot. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Of course. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But it strikes me that one question that has to be on the table is: Do we maintain the same  form of open market operations th at we always have?  If you look at the size of these required alternative assets, you  could buy a lot of baseball teams.  I know one I'd like to sell you!  [Laughter]  

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  We’re okay, thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

 MS. MINEHAN.  I don't think the people who ar e working on the alternative assets part of this study have quite take n into account baseball teams! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We are going to  start to run out of alternatives. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes, I think that  is right.  That takes me to  the real point I wanted to raise, which is that cash is driv ing this.  And cash not only has an impact on our balance sheet, it has an impact on our fiscal infrastructure as well. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You mean currency? MS. MINEHAN.  Currency needs, and so fort h.  Are we doing anything--and maybe I should answer that question--to look at whether there are ways in the future to diminish the supply of  91cash that is necessary or reduce the growth rate of currency?  The balance sheet needs on the liabilities side are driven by the increasing growth in the use of cash in this country. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Most of the growth is overseas. MR. SIMPSON.  That's right. MS. MINEHAN.  That’s right.  I know it's mostly overseas. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  We don't have anything as part of  this project to look at ways to diminish the growth of currency.  And I wonde r as a policy issue, do we want to  diminish the growth of this noninterest-earning debt  out there?   

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  It's at least worth looking at. MR. JORDAN.  Why? MR. KOHN.  We have always responded passively to demands for currency. MR. MCTEER.  The seigniorage is good! MR. PARRY.  It beats taxes. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  There is an implied tax on it. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  For the holders. MS. MINEHAN.  Yes, in terms of all of the vaults that we are building and the infrastructure that we have. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  It's a very low interest rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  We spend $2 bi llion a year more or less and we get back $28 billion a year. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Well, that's right. MR. FERGUSON.  I'd rather do profit sharing!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Okay.  92

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think what this te lls us is that this whole issue is much closer up front than I think most of us have intu itively suspected.  It is very difficult to get around the fact that if the off-budget items stay off budget a nd this actually acts as a unified budget surplus, the arithmetic is awesome. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, it is, but in a way we do have some time to consider the right decision, particularly if we are willing to change  the 25 percent.  I agree that there is a sense of urgency but what really comes through is  the importance of the issue, I think. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay, any further questions?  Shall we go to lunch?  The next meeting is Wednesday, November 15th.
