CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Mr. Kos. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I’ll be referring to the pa ckage of colored charts that was distributed this afternoon. 1 U.S. short-term interest rates have continued to decline during the intermeeting period, reflecting weake r-than-expected economic data and weak corporate earnings reports. Three-month cash rates fell 33 basis points since the last meeting and 3-m onth forward rates declined 31 basis points. The 3-month deposit rate nine  months forward, the yellow line, has also fallen by a similar amount, but it continues to imply higher interest rates for the first half  of 2002, although I shoul d add that anecdotal conversations find few people who go along with that expectation.  The exception is the minority of market pa rticipants who believe that a sharp recovery will manifest it self in the second half.  In the middle panel, the euro-area cas h rates have been stable since the Committee’s last meeting.  But the 3-month and 9-month forward rates have been pulled down, as data have co me in weaker for the euro area as a whole and for Germany in particular.   In the bottom panel ar e three snapshots of th e Japanese government yield curve from three months out to ten years.  The three snapshot dates were March 1st, a few weeks before the change in the Bank of Japan’s operational target, May 15th, and June 25th. At first, the bill sector was bumping up against the zero axis, but now the short end of the coupon curve is also being dragged down. And as we speak, all Japanese government bond maturities out to three years yield 14 basis points or less. On the next page is an update of a chart that you last saw at the March meeting.  The chart depicts the shape of  the yield curve at the short end in the major economies.  The top panel s hows the 2-year yield less the central bank’s short-term policy rate.  The bottom panel shows the 2-year swap rate less the same policy rate.  I should note  that the policy rates used involve slightly different maturities; some cen tral banks have an overnight rate, some a rate with a maturity of as lo ng as two weeks.  And the top panel uses the German 2-year note versus the ECB’s refinancing rate.  The bottom panel uses the euro 2-year swap  rate.  Whether measured against the 2-year note or the swap rate, we obser ve fairly sharp inversions by year-end 2000. Since the easings of the past fe w months by the central banks of the 1 Copies of th e charts ar e appended to this transcript.  (Appendix 1) 6/26-27/01 2United States, the euro area, Canada , the United Kingdom , and Japan, the degree of inversions has lessened, or in some cases turned slightly positiv e. In the last few weeks, though, som e yield curves have reinverted or seem headed in th at direction. Turning to the next page, the top pa nel depicts the 2-year, 10-year, and 30-year U.S. Treasury yields since Marc h 1st.  Unlike the flat or inverted short end of the curve, th e coupon curve is steep.  The 2- to 30-year spread has widened another 5 basis points si nce the last Comm ittee m eeting to about 166 basis points today. The m iddle panel shows spreads of 10-year A-rated industrial bonds, the 10-year  Fannie Mae benchm ark, and the 10­year swap rate over T reasuries.  The spreads, which had been narrowing all year desp ite the strong p ace of new issues and po or news from the corporate sector, have begun to widen out ever so s lightly in the past couple of weeks.  In the bottom panel, we see the sam e kind of pattern with respect to the Merrill Lynch high-yield index and th e EMBI+ spreads.  Again, m ost of that widening has occurred in the past couple of weeks.   Now, given the large am ount of issuance by the corporate sector, perhaps it’s not surprising that the ma rket is digesting som ewhat and that spreads are backing up a bit. An alte rnative hypothesis s uggests that a bit of risk aversion m ight be setting in, as som e market participants m ay be having second thoughts about the appropria te level of spreads if the tim ing of the recovery is being pushed out. The top panel of the next page ha s the major U.S. equity indic es indexed to April 17th, the day before the FOMC’s interm eeting m ove.  As we can see, equities app reciated sh arply in th e weeks af ter th at move, then went sideways for a while, but actual ly have f allen from their late -May levels by between 5 and 10 per cent, as corporate earnings preannouncem ents have been largely negative. The m iddle panel shows a sim ilar, if more pronounced, pattern to the downside for m ajor foreign indices.  And, in fact, today European m arkets were down another 2 percent on aver age.  Perhaps there, too, we’re witnessing som e signs of risk aver sion over the p ast few weeks, as corporate an d econom ic forecasts were  being revised down.  However, if we saw pronounced risk aversion, then we m ight also expect to see an uptick in implied volatilities on equity  indices.  But as the bottom  panel shows, the implied volatility on the S& P 100 futures, also known as the VIX Index, has actually been trending  lower and the abso lute level is toward the lower end of its observed historical range.   Turning to the next page, let m e say a word on th e euro-do llar exchange rate. The top panel depicts th at rate since the launch of the euro in January of 1999. The middle panel ch arts the differentials between the 6/26-27/01 3U.S. and euro rates for 3-month depos its, the 2-year swap, and the 10-year swap. We observe the sharp narrowing dur ing that time in the euro’s favor.  But I would note that the 10-year swap spread stopped narrowing in spread still favors the dollar by about 60 basis points. The bottom  panel has 1- and 12-m onth implied volatilities of the euro-dollar exchange rate for that sam e period.  I would m ake two points.  First, volatilities have drifted higher for a lmost the whole two-year period after the euro ’s launch, as the euro depreciat ed and as most traders and analysts were certain that the euro would and should rise.  Second, volatilities have actually been falling during this m ost recent period of euro weakness.  The bearish view  accounting for this change in  behavior is that the m arket is no longer fighting euro weakness and has becom e comfortable with the euro trading in th e mid- to high 80s.  The bullish v iew is that p erhaps positio ns that needed to be insured by options have been reduced. Now, if the weaker long s are out and  hence the o verhang of long euro po sition s has been flushed out of the market, then ironically that m ay suggest that the euro m ight finally begin to  rise.  Time will tell. Turning to the last page and a word about reserves, the top panel graphs our f orecast for currency g rowth for the rest of 2001.  As of the May FOMC m eeting, we were still forecasti ng 5 percent currency growth for the remainder of 2001, consistent with the relatively slow growth we saw in 2000. Since that m eeting we have adju sted expected curre ncy growth to 7 percen t to reflect the fas ter growth ob served in the  most recen t months and also our an ticipation that curren cy grow th may revert toward the pace th at we had seen before last year. The bottom  panel shows the im plications of this change for our operations. This chart is an updated version of one you saw at the last meeting, outlining the ex pected net g rowth of SOMA, shown by the blue bars, and our total purchases  of securities required to offset redem ptions--if the entire need were m et by outrigh t purchases--shown by the gray bars.  We at the Desk expect to rely m ostly on outright purchases to m eet these reserv e need s, but I am  a little relu ctant to rely solely on outright purchases given our a lready hef ty presenc e in th e market.  To som e degree we will benefit, though very slightly, from the Treasury’s introduction of a four-week Treasury bill, which is expected in  mid-July or August.  We plan to participa te in the auc tions for those bills and we will a lso loo k to expand modestly the long-term  repo book, which has been at $12 billion recently.   Let m e mention two other item s if I m ay, Mr. Chairm an.  Two m emos were circulated to the Comm ittee last week. The first is a note regarding a technical adjustm ent to our collateral pool as it rela tes to Sallie Mae debt.  The second m emo, from Don Kohn and myself, provided an update on the 6/26-27/01 4 work that’s being done on the SOMA a ssets study and I’d like to m ake two points about that second m emo.  First, there is a group of people researching the possibility of adding Ginnie Mae debt to the list of  assets that we buy, and we hope to provide an  update on that issue at the August meeting of  this Comm ittee.  There w as also a typ o in the cov er note that I wanted to correct. Second, with re spect to m unicipal debt and foreign sovereign debt, as the m emo indicates, we have looked at both possibilities.  The m unicipal debt does not seem  to show prom ise for our operational needs, while the foreign sovereign debt  has som e potential.  We would like to explo re the latter po ssibility f urther, but at the sam e time--with the Comm ittee’s concurrence--cease furt her work on municipal debt.   Mr. Chairm an, ther e were no f oreign operations  in this p eriod.  I will need a vote to ratify our dom estic op erations.  And I’d be happy to answer any questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Questions for Dino? 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Does your currency  forecast m ake any explicit assum ption about currency dem and as we head toward the end of the year and the laun ch of the euro as  the currency in Europe? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Not explicitly. Some noise m ay be created so it m ay have some effect.  But we think it’s likely to be very sm all, or at least th at’s the assum ption em bedded in the forecast. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Well, there has been som e anecdotal speculation that the countries that are outside the euro area--where very large amounts of deutsche marks are held and no provisions have been m ade for conversion--m ay find alternatives in either Federal Reserve notes or travelers checks or som ething, at  least tem porarily.  I’ve been told  that the price of jewelry, of diam onds and so forth, is really skyrocketing in Europe.  But the word is that large am ounts of Federal Reserve notes also are being used again. 6/26-27/01 5

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. It’s possible that we m ay see that  effect, but it’s very hard to m easure and to forecast so we have not really included it in ou r projections.  Sandy, do you have an ything to add? 

[SECTION]

MS. KRIEGER. To the extent that we have  seen a slowdown in the reflow of cash from  abroad, it has b een incorporated  in the foreca st.  But we didn’t build in an explicit addition to growth re lated to the euro.  Our analysts are f ollowing the pa ttern of foreign currency dem and, but they haven’t added anything extra, in term s of it escalating as the year goes on, because we don’t really know how much to put in. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. If that did happen, that woul d make the Desk’s burden even bigger. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. The data I rem ember seeing th rough April--I don’t know that we have shipm ents data through May--from  several large banks that specializ e in this kind of activity did not show any pickup in net shipm ents to any of thes e countries.  We looked specifically for that.  Now it’s very early before the launch of the euro  currency, and  the anecdo tal sto ries are already starting. Nevertheless, we couldn’ t really see any evid ence of that in the shipm ents data.   

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Well, the anecdotes were all over th e place by anecdotal reports are a little exaggerated. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. On page 4, in the panel showing the VIX index, as I understand it there ’s som e seasonality in tha t index --or a t least I heard som e market commentary to that effect.  Do you have any idea what is norm al for the summ er?  It’s usually lower in the summ er, as I understand it. Secondly, is that just a 30-day volatility?   If so, it doesn’t look very far into the future.  6/26-27/01 6

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. That’s r ight.  I’m  not f amiliar with the seasona l charac teristics of  this index, but the pattern we have s een is that it tends to run betw een the low 20s--perhaps the high teens--and the low 40s. So on an absolute level, it’s  fairly low, and I thin k it’s interes ting to no te that the tren d has been h eading dow nward.  I don’t want to m ake too much of it, but if one were thinking that risk aversion was setting in, one m ight point to this as an indicator going the other way. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Yes, I understood that was the reason you put it in there.  But m y question h ad to do with its norm al seasonal pattern. So before we reach a conclusion about what that index suggests, I think we  better know what the usual se asonality is.  I don’t know the answer to th at. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Again, there m ay be some seasona l there.  I don’t know that it’s so pronounced that it would affect th e index in a m eaningful way. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I don’t know one way or the other either.  Okay, thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions for Dino?  I assume there are no objections to his request to go forward in the manner he described relevant to municipal and foreign issues. If I hear none, I assume that it’s perfectly fine. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, I move approval of the domestic operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objectio n, they are approved.  We now go to a series of very interesting studies on the issue of pr oductivity.  Dan, will you be starting it off?

[SECTION]

 MR. SICHEL. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  In response to the wishes of the Comm ittee for a discu ssion of productivity developm ents, the staff will be presenting three briefi ngs this afternoon.  Sandy Struckm eyer and I will discuss the staff’s view on structural productivity and potential output. Jeff Fuhrer will present the p erspective o f the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Charlie S teindel will di scuss the productivity slowdown of the 6/26-27/01 7 late 1960 s and early 197 0s.  We will be  referring to the m aterials labeled “Staff Briefings on Productivity Developm ents.”2 The performance of the U.S. economy in the second half of the 1990s was nothing short of remarkable.  One of the key factors driving this economic resurgence was the substa ntial acceleration in la bor productivity, following nearly a quarter century of sluggish grow th.  As can be seen in the upper left panel of chart 1, the average growth ra te of labor productivity picked up from 1.5 percent in the period from the early 1970s through 1995 to 2.8 percent since then. As seen at the right, th e growth rate of la bor productivity has tended to rise since 1995, although more recently it has dropped back as the economy has slowed and as a retrenchment  has taken hold in the tech sector.  This briefing reviews what we know about the causes of the resurgence in the second half of the 1990s and, given the most recent developments, assesses how much of that pickup  is likely to persist.    As highlighted by the bullets in the lower pane l, we  first ex plore the sources of the pickup, exam ining how m uch resulted fr om more rapid capital accum ulation and how much from  a quick ening of the pace of technolog ical progress. We focus particularly on the role played by information technology. To assess th e sources of th e pickup, we use a tradition al growth accounting fram ework, relying p rimarily on the multifactor productivity  data produced by the BLS. Following that disc ussion, we then turn to the question of how much of the recent  productivity growth is cy clical and how m uch is structural. Finally, give n today’s econom ic situation, we discuss the outlook for structural labor produc tivity and potential output.    The upper panel of chart 2 lays out  a sim plified versi on of the standard neoclass ical growth acco unting framework that we use--a fram ework that was developed by Robert Solow and Edward  Denison in the 1950s and 1960s.  As shown in equation 1--where dots over va riables indicate gr owth rates --this approach expresses growth in output (des ignated Q) as a weighted average of the growth rates of the inputs. The two inputs included in the equation are capital services (labeled K) and labor hours (shown as L).  In this expression, the growth rate of each input is multiplied by its income share--denoted by s for the income share of capital and (1-s) for labor’s share.  The portion of output growth not attributable to gr owth in inputs is the multifactor productivity residual (labeled MFP ); it also has been called total factor productivity. It is a catch-all for technological or organizational improvements that increase output for a given amount of input.      Equation 2 decom poses growth in labor productivity (labeled LP).  In this decomposition, growth in labor pr oductivity reflects increases in the amount of capital per hour worked (refe rred to as capital deepening ) and MFP  2 Copies of this m aterial are appended  to this transcript.  (Appendix 2) 6/26-27/01 8 growth. In our empirical implementation of these equations, we also include a term that accounts for changes in labor composition; that is, for the effects of changes in the experience, gender,  and educational attainment of the workforce—factors that might  affect labor productivity.     Before getting to the num bers, th e lower panel lays out som e of the key strengths and weaknesses of the grow th accounting fram ework.  One strength of the growth accounting approach is that it is based on the m icroeconom ic theory of the firm , applied to the overall econom y.  In addition, the approach is straigh tforward and intuitiv e, rep resenting ou tput growth as  a sim ple weighted average of the growth of inputs.   And, it is a rich  approach that can help to identify the sources of grow th in a period of structural change.     A weakness of the growth accounting approach is that it requires several strong assumptions about how the econom y functions.  For exam ple, the approach a ssumes that m arkets are com petitive and always in equilibriu m.  In addition, as typically implem ented, the growth accounting approach assum es that capital becom es productive as soon as it is installed.  This assum ption seem s reasonable for som e types of asse ts, such as personal com puters, but probably is not reasonable for certain types of comple x infrastructure--such as communications networks--where elem ents put in place now m ay not be brought on line for a number of years. Also, a full im plem entation of this framework imposes heavy data requir ements, raising the possibility of measure ment error.  Finally, this appr oach ignores the costs of adjusting capital stocks. For sm all changes, this assum ption probably does not m atter much, but supply shocks that induc e significant changes in production technologies or relative pr ices--such as large energy price shocks--m ay cause the m odel to go off track.  Despite these lim itations, this fram ework has been a mainstay of growth analysis for m any years, reflecting the widespread view that it generates num bers that are sensible.     Our em pirical im plementation of  growth accou nting is the s ubject of your next ch art.  We start with th e multifactor productiv ity data set put together by the BLS, foc using on the nonfar m business sector.  The output measure--which is based on the Nati onal Income and Product Accounts--is real GDP in the nonfarm  business sector , and the m easure of labor hours is based on the series for hours of all persons published by the BLS. For capital, BLS uses the co ncept of cap ital services, which I will describ e in a minute.  As indicated in the second bu llet, the BL S uses these m easures of output, capital, labor, and labor com position to calculate MF P as a res idual using a growth accounting fram ework sim ilar to equation 1.     Currently, BLS has published MF P only through 1999.  To extend these data to 2000, we use published inform ation on output and hours, and we construct a f igure for capital services using published data on investm ent.  Because we trans late inv estment to ca pital services at a higher level of 6/26-27/01 9 aggregation than will the BLS when t hey estim ate MFP for 2000, there is an extra elem ent of uncertain ty surrounding our numbers for 2000.  To generate quarterly nu mbers that can tie into  our Greenboo k forecast, we then interpolate the BLS annual num bers fo r output, hours, capital services, and labor com position.  From these numbers, we calculate quarterly estim ates of MFP growth.    The middle panel describes the capita l services concept used by the BLS.  Growth in capital se rvices (denoted by Kt) is a weighted average of the growth in individual capita l stocks.  These individua l stocks are denoted Kit, where the subscript i indexes the different types of capital.  The weight for each asset (the “ w”s) reflects the marginal  product, or relative efficiency, of a particular asset. The weights differ pr imarily because of differences in the useful lives of each asset. For exampl e, a unit of computer capital has a short useful life and likely will be scrapped after only a few years.  Because the cost of the computer is amortized over  a very short period of time, it has a high marginal product and gets a high weight.  In effect, the service flow from a unit of this capital must be la rge enough to cover the costs of rapid obsolescence. In contrast, a unit of o ffice building capital--which has quite a long useful life--generates a smaller serv ice flow in a year and gets a smaller weight because the costs of the asset can be amortized over many years.     Using the growth-accounting fram ework and the data I just described, the lower p anel decom poses the g rowth of actual labor pr oductiv ity gro wth for selected periods. The decom positi on shown is quite sim ilar to that reported in a series of research pape rs, including work by Steve Oliner an d myself and by Dale Jorgenson and Kevin Stiroh. The first tw o colum ns compare the period of relatively slug gish productivity growth from  1973 to 1995 to the resurgence period from  1995 to 2000; the third colum n shows the acceleration between the two periods.   As can be s een on lin e 1, the rate of increase in actual labor productivity rose from  1.5 percent per year to 2.8 percent per year--an acceleration of 1.3 percentage points.  This pickup reflected larger contributions from  capital deepening (line 2), which stepped up 0.5 percentage point per year. MFP gr owth (line 6) accounted for the rest of the pickup. By these num bers, ca pital deepen ing accoun ted for a bit le ss than half of the pickup in  labor productivity growth.    Because o f our interest in inform ation technolo gy, we exten d the system to split th e capital deepe ning te rm into the po rtion rela ted to I T capita l-­including computer hardware, softwa re, and com munications equipm ent--and to all other business capital. And, we also split MFP growth  into the portion coming from the production of computer s and related sem iconductors and the portion coming from  all other sectors.  To do this, we use information on relative prices and shares of these high-tech products to estimate the MFP contri bution related to their production. 6/26-27/01 10       As can be seen by comparing lines 2 and 3, greater use of IT equipment and software more than accounted fo r the rise in capital deepening.  Moreover, MFP growth arising from the production of computers and the semiconductors that go into them (line 7) accounted for a noticeable chunk of the step-up in MFP growth, even though these sectors represent a small share of total output. Taken together, the use of IT--represented by the IT capital deepening numbers on line 3--and th e MFP gains associated with the production  of IT (shown on line 7) accounted for 1 percentage point of the 1.3 percentage point resurgence in labor  productivity growth in the second half of the 1990s.        Som e analysts, m ost notably Robert Gordon, have argued that the pickup in MFP growth was concentrated in the production of IT, and, indeed, those sectors m ade a sizable contribution to the step-up in MFP growth.  However, as line 8 indicates, the se ctors outside of the produc tion of IT contributed 0.4 percen tage p oint m ore to MFP growth in the s econd part of th e decade than in the first. Although som e portion of th is pickup likely was cyclical, these numbers indicate that this broader se ctor of the econom y also enjoyed a resurgence of actual MF P growth from 1995 to 2000.         Sandy Struckm eyer will now co ntinue ou r presentation. 

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. Dan has descri bed the data that we use in our analys is of the supply side of the econom y.  I will outline ou r methods for estim ating the rate of growth of struct ural productivity and potential output.  Referring to the top of char t 4, the sta rting po int for our ana lysis is the s imple observation that the growth of labor productivity is procyclical.  Labor productivity typically rise s rapidly during the recove ry phase of the business cycle, s lows down in the expansion p hase, and declines durin g recess ions. For m any purposes in econom ic analysis, it  is ess ential to ab stract f rom these short-run sw ings and focus instead on the underlying rate of increase in productivity. For exam ple, firm s may base their pricing decisions on “norm al” unit cos ts that correct fo r short-run cyclic al variation in productivity, or households m ay base th eir consumption on their perceptions of their perm anent incom e, which arguabl y reflect their views of the long-run growth in their real incom es and hence the tr end in productivity.           Thus, for our m edium - to long-run analysis, we define structural productivity growth as the com pone nt of productivity growth that can be sustain ed over a com plete business cycl e.  It has also been called “trend” productivity growth or “cyclically ad justed” productivity growth by other researchers. Its determ inants are the same as those Dan described except that estim ates are m ade of the structural c ontribution s of each of its com ponents-­with one im portant exception.  We do not distinguish between actual and structural growth in capital services .  Although business investm ent clearly fluctuates o ver the bus iness cycle, in our view the actual path for investm ent-­6/26-27/01 11 and hence the actual growth in individua l industry capital stocks and services­-best captures the resources availabl e to produce goods and services at any point in tim e.  We also do not adjust for changes in the work week of capital in our m easure of the growth of capital services.  Such an adjustm ent could be m ade for m anufacturing industr ies, but it would be m uch more problem atic in the trade and service sectors.          Given these assum ptions, the critic al part of our analys is is the estim ation of structural MFP. Initial estim ates of structural MFP growth are generated using several econom etric m odels.  Thes e estim ates are refined using other inform ation about technological devel opments and supply shocks (such as increases in energy prices) that influence the choice of production technologies. The black line in the m iddle panel of the chart shows actual MFP growth. If all of th e recen t pick up were jud ged to be perm anent, this series m ight be viewed as an upper bound on structural MFP growth.  The staff’s estim ate of stru ctural MFP gr owth is shown in red.  Beginning in 1991, it m oves up in discrete steps to a 1.2 percent growth rate in the post­1998 period.         W e put together the pieces of structural prod uctiv ity gro wth in the table in the lower panel. As you can see on line 1, structural  productivity grew slowly over the 1973 to 1995 period but  accelerated m arkedly after 1995, reach ing 3.2  percen t last year by our estim ates.  A significan t part of this step-up can be attributed to the boom  in investm ent spending over that period that substantia lly raised the c ontribution f rom capital deep ening (line 2).  But the rise in structural MFP (shown on line 4) al so is an im portant part of the story.        Your next chart presents our  estim ates of pot ential output growth over history and our projections  through 2002.  By our defini tion, potential output is the leve l of real GDP that coul d be produced with existing plant and equipm ent when the unem ploym ent rate is equal to the NAIRU.  Potential output grow th is estim ated as the sum of potential labor hours and structural labor productivity. As shown on lines 2 through 6, the prim ary determ inant of potential labor hours is growth in th e civilian population.  However, it also incorporates shifts over tim e in labor  force participation, the employm ent rate, and the average wo rkweek.  For exam ple, the increase in  labor force participation over the 1973 to 1995 pe riod is estim ated to have boosted potential output growth by alm ost ½ pe rcentage point per year, but this was partially offset by a lessening in the average nu mber of hours worked each week (line 6). Movem ents in the NAI RU also affect our estim ates of potential output growth through the po tential em ploym ent rate shown on line 5; a decline in the NAIRU increas es the quantity of labor em ployed at full employm ent, raising the potential em ployment rate.  By our estim ates, the percen tage p oint per year, on average, to the growth of potential output over that period.    6/26-27/01 12       Our forecast for po tential outpu t growth is s hown on the right-hand s ide of the table. We project  potential real GDP to increase 3.4 percent in 2001 and 2002--much m ore slowly than in rece nt years--owing to less rapid growth in structural labor produc tivity (line 7) and potential  labor hours (line 2).  The anticipated slowdown in the growth of potential labor hours reflects the updrift in the staff’s estim ate of the NAIRU (line 12), which pushes down the potential em ploym ent rate (line 5) in both years.         The contribution from  capita l deepening to structural productivity growth (shown on line 8) also is exp ected to drop back, given our Greenbook forecast of a declin e in b usiness investm ent this y ear and on ly modest gro wth in 2002. As you will recall, we began linking ou r estim ates of capital deepening to the projected Greenbook path  for investm ent last summ er.  We felt that such a direct link would he lp to ensure consistency between our estim ates of the supply side of the ec onom y and our outlook for investm ent.  At the tim e, Dave Stockton predicted  that this wo uld m ake our forecas t for potential output growth much m ore variab le than in the pa st--ce rtainly o ne of Dave’s best forecasts of the past y ear!  [Laughter] But, given the wide fluctuations in capital spending since early 2000, we believe this approach has helped us to better m onito r and better understand supply-side developm ents and th eir implications fo r our forecasts of econ omic activ ity and inf lation .        In contrast to the sm aller c ontribution from  capital deepening, we expect structural M FP (line 10) to continue to grow at th e 1-1/4 pe rcent pace that we estim ate has prevailed since 1998.  Desp ite the econom ic weakness this year, businesses reported ly are proceed ing with plans  to use inform ation technologies to stream line the ways they deal with their custom ers and suppliers. A recen t survey of planned research an d development expend itures also sugges ts that MFP growth will rem ain stron g.  As shown in the lower left panel, th e Batte lle Institute repo rts that R&D ex penditu res will in crease another 3-1/4 percent in real term s in 2001, after growth of  5-3/4 percent per year from 1995 to 2000. This finding is consistent with statem ents from many high-tech firm s that, despite cutb acks in other parts of their budgets, spending f or R&D is key to the ir long-run f inanc ial su ccess a nd will not b e scaled b ack.       The lower righ t pane l of the char t illus trates one possible s tress tes t of our estim ates of structural productivity growth and potential output: Okun’s law. Okun’s law has proven to be one of the m ost reliable methods for forecasting the unem ploym ent rate.  Using our es timates of the NAIRU and potential output, we estim ate a version of Okun’ s law (specified in levels) through 1994 and then perform  a dynam ic, out-of-sam ple simulation from 1995 through the first quarte r of 2001.  If our estim ates of potential output growth are too high, we would expe ct Okun’s law to over-predict the 6/26-27/01 13 unem ployment ra te; con versely, if  we ar e too pes simistic abo ut poten tial, the model will u nderpred ict.  As you can see, with ou r estim ate of potential output grow th, Okun’s law tracks the m ovements in the unemploym ent rate fairly closely over this period. This gives us som e confidence that our estim ates are not too far off the m ark. Jeff Fuhrer will now co ntinue the presentation.

MR. FUHRER. I’d like to begin by thanking Don Kohn a nd Sandy Struckm eyer for inviting the Boston F ed to give its perhaps aberrant views on productivity developm ents.       I’d also like to start off by e mphasizing that  I am  a productivity optim ist.  I believe that the crea tion, adoption, and adaptation of new technologies over the past twenty year s has increased the efficiency with which the econom y produces a wide va riety of goods and services. As you know, this process, while inherently a surge in the level  of productivity, is ongoing and gradual, and has thus been ma nifested in a notable rise in the average growth  rate of productivity. The pr ocess continues today; I am optimistic not just about the past, but about the future gr owth of productivity. I want to take a m inute today to raise a few questions--in particular, quantitatively: how m uch optim ism is warranted, and with how m uch precision can we quantify it?   Second, how  much weight should we put on the most recen t observations  in estim ating trend prod uctiv ity gro wth?  And finally, how much m ore difficult doe s the strong com plementarity of computer hardware and software m ake our attem pts to m easure the capital services that derive from  them ? To anticipate m y answer s to th ese questions, I believe th at:  (1) statistically, it is difficult to justify long-run productivity growth much in excess of 2.5 percent or so; (2) how m uch weight to put on the m ost recent observations is largely a matter of judgm ent, not statistics; and (3) the interactions betw een com puter hardware and software m ake inferences about capital services especi ally difficult and subject to m ore than the norm al degree of uncertainty, which is large to begin with . To put m y cards on the table, I esti mate that we currently enjoy a 2.5 percen t trend rate of  productiv ity gr owth  and will likely continue at a ra te near that for the next 5 to 10 years.  Reassuringly, as of  the June Greenbook, the Board staff and I have converged on the sam e near-term  estim ate.  My basis for this long-run assessm ent is that network and telecommunications technologies are still evolving, and their im provem ent, adaptation, and gradual ado ption will likely add to pr oductivity  over the n ext decade.  My estim ate of current and near-term  produc tivity growth is de rived, as is the 6/26-27/01 14 Board staff’s, from  a variety of tech niques including dir ect tre nd estim ation, inference from  Okun’s law relationships, and growth accoun ting.  All of these involve a good m easure of judgm ent. To begin, I’d like to take a very si mple look at aggregate productivity data. Turning to the next page of our  briefing m aterials,  the top panel of figure 1 displays the distribution of qu arterly productiv ity gr owth rates o ver the pas t 6 years.  I cho se this peri od because m any have dated  the shift in productivity  growth to early 1995, and I will p rovide evid ence corrobo rating that date in a m oment.  What do I see in this sim ple picture? First, there are only 25 quarterly numb ers in this plot.  That is not much data from  which to infer a trend sh ift.  As a necessary consequence, we cannot say with m uch certainty whether a shift has occurred, and if so, how large the shift is. Again,  I believe a shift upward to  about 2.5 percent growth has occurred. But I could not rule out the Board s taff’s earlier, m ore optim istic es timates, nor could I ru le out the poss ibility tha t recent productivity surges will prove largely transitory. The second observation to m ake from the figure is that the 25 quarters fall m ore than 2 to 1 in growth rates below 3.5 percent.  The average growth rate during the period is about 2.5 percent. Turning to the bottom  panel of figure 1, it is not the case that higher growth rates tend to be clustered in the more recent years or that lower growth rates are clustered in the early portion of the sample.  This panel uses the same color-coding by growth range as the upper panel, from slow growth (dark blue) to rapid (red). As the lo wer panel indicates, sl ow and moderately rapid growth rates are fairly evenly dist ributed across the six years.  This time distribution of growth rates suggests th at, while the average growth rate has likely shifted up, the basis for an ongoing  acceleration in productivity is not as immediately evident. Nonetheless, the three highest grow th rates in this period occurred relatively recently, in the third and f ourth quarters of 1999 and the second quarter of 2000. As a result, the rate of productivity growth for the four quarters ending in the 2nd quarter of 2000 was an ast onishing 5.3 percent.  If evidence of further acceleration is to be found, it is in the fairly short and recen t perio d from  mid-1999 throug h mid-2000. More f ormal statistica l tests for produ ctivity trend shif ts conf irm the insights from this sim ple analysis.  Figur e 2 presents results of tests for a shift in the p roductivity trend allowing for m ultiple un known breakpoints. This test looks for breakpoints over a given sa mple while rem aining completely agnostic about the location of the breakpoi nts.  It’s im portant to note that, owing to restrictions from statis tical theory, this procedure d oes not allow 6/26-27/01 15 breakpoints too frequently, say every two or three years, or breaks too close to the beginning or end of the sample .  But I think that’s actually a good thing: determining frequent or rece nt breaks in trends is a matter for judgment, not statistics. The actual quarterly growth in nonfarm  business productivity is shown in the gray bars in the figure. The red line depicts the estim ated trend productivity growth rates for the sub- periods defined by the breakpoints. The figure suggests the following: The sim plest test, shown in the t op panel, finds a shift in trend productivity growth in early 1995. The estim ated growth rate from  1995 to 2001 is 2.4 percent. In the m iddle panel, I add to the brea kpoint test regressors that attem pt to control for “cyclical” effects on pr oductivity growth--rapid, unm easured increases in labor effort  during spurts of high dem and, for exam ple.  While these cy clical effects are indeed s ignificant in exp laining some of the quarterly fluctuations in productivity , they do not m aterially alter the estim ates of the recent trend grow th rate from  the top panel. In the bottom panel, the growth in capital servic es per hour--the “capital deepening” variable of choice-- is added to the test regression.  The addition of this variable virtu ally el iminates any recen t shifts in trend productivity. That is, after contro lling for capital deepening, average productivity growth since the m id-1990s is roughly equal to the average for the dozen years before th at. This las t result sugges ts that m ultifactor productivity growth,  which accounts for the bulk of labor productiv ity after excluding the effects of capital deep ening, has g rown at a healt hy pace o ver the p ast decade or m ore ­-about a percentage point faster than in the dism al ’70s and early ’80s. However, this m ethod provides little evidence of a m ore recent increase in trend m ultifactor p roductivity growth.  Sustained increases in productivity must ultim ately be suppo rted by m ultifactor p roductiv ity gro wth--that is, by technological progress. With stea dy technological progress, we can continuously add new m achines that  embody the latest technology without suffering dim inishing returns.  I belie ve that this process of embodied-technology-driven investm ent was at the heart of the capital deepening in the late 1990s and m ay well drive additiona l capital deepening when we recover from  the current slowdown.  But once ag ain, an acceleration in productivity which aris es from an increase in the ra te of grow th of multifactor produ ctivity is hard to justify using this m ethodology. In discussing Figure 1, I noted that  the evidence for a m ore rapid increase in productivity growth lies in a few key observations between m id­6/26-27/01 16 1999 and m id-2000.  This leads naturally to the question: In assessing changes in productivity growth, how much weight should one put on the recen t past?  As I suggested, th is is larg ely a m atter of judgm ent, not statistics or econom ic theory.  Your next chart (f igure 3) displays the evolution of the Board staff’s estim ates of structural productivity growth over the past six years. As the chart indicates, as recently as m id-1997, the Board staff had estim ated structural productivity growt h, shown in the black dotted lines, at below 1 percent, which looks quite pessi mistic by today’s standards.  To be sure, som e of this pessim ism arose from  the less robust growth evident in the unrevised, real-tim e data show n in the ligh t gray  line. As of September 1999, the Board estim ated trend growth for 2001 (the bold red line at the right) at 2.3 per cent.  From that point, their estim ate rose dram atically, increasing alm ost 1.5 percentage point s in less than 12 months, echoing actual productivity perform ance in 1999 and early 2000. Since August of 2000, the Board’s forecast for structural prod uctiv ity gro wth for 2001 has fallen alm ost 1.2 percentage  points, just as actual productivity growth has slowed. In the interest of full disclosure, I shou ld note tha t I was probably too slow to revise m y estimat es of productivity growth upward.  In of 1999 m y estim ate was at 1.75 percent; and only by September of 2000 had I raised m y estim ate to 2 .5 percen t, where it s tands now. Of course, the Board staff’s risi ng and falling estim ates arise through the link between the staff’s investment forecas t and its com putation of capital services per hour. Rapid investm ent im plies larger net additi ons to the capital stock, a larger flow of capita l serv ices from that s tock, and more cap ital services per hour. While this m ethodol ogy has a sound theoretical basis, our judgm ent is that it has produced larg e and rapid swings in structural productivity that m ay stretch m any people’ s notion of “structural.” I offer two reasons for smoothing through som e of these recent bursts of productivity: First, it is conceivable that m uch of the investm ent in 1999/2000 was Y2K­related com puter investm ent--or just generic over-investm ent--that didn’t deliver m uch in the way of additional cap ital services.  Second, we think it likely that a good portion of both the unusually high productivity num bers and the very  recen t lower ones refl ects unm easured variation s in effort , rather than changes in underlying productivit y.  Not all hours of work yield the same effective input.  It is  likely that workers can in crease effort per hour for short periods of time when demand is high.  These unmeasured changes in the intensity of effort may have allowed temporary, unsustainable increases in output without structural productivity increases. Finally, I’d like to raise a con ceptual question about how well our productivity  accounting system s capture the join t contribution  of com puting equipm ent and software to capital serv ices per worker.  In essence, m y concern boils down to th e possibility that we m ay have over-adjusted 6/26-27/01 17 computer prices for quality im provem ents, thus over-estim ating their contribution to real output and productiv ity.  No doubt the rapid declines in hardware prices approxim ate the in creased p rocessor speed and storage capacity of new com puter m odels.  Howeve r, it m ay not be the case that these incre ases in hardware c apability ac curately ref lect the incr eased f unction ality provided to businesses by the com bined hardware-software bundle.  Hardware often advances just enough to  make it possible to run the latest software. Here I have in m ind, for exam ple, the “killer apps” reference in the staff m emo on capital o verhang--killer ap plications that require new hardware to run them .  As a result, the services  delivered by the bundle of hardware and software are not likely to equal the sum of the independently com puted service flows for hardware and software. In addition, this interdependence of the developm ent of ne w software and ha rdware is a key determ inant of the effective rate of hardware obsolescence.   This is a signi fican t departu re from standard assum ptions about capital  depreciation.  These com plexities seriously tax our standard m ethods fo r tracking the additions to capital services of the hardware /software bundle.  I am not suggesting an elegant alternative to our curr ent m ethods, although I believe this will be an important area for future research.  But I do wish to point out that this funda mentally com plex conceptual problem  adds to the uncertainty surrounding our estim ates of capital serv ices and, hence, of structural productivity growth. In sum , our near-term  estim ate of  trend productivity growth is 2.5 percent, the sam e as the Board’s current estim ate, although w e have sometimes differed in the past and m ay in the future.  The long-run prognosis for productivity growth is also good,  because it appears th at the growth in multifactor productivity  has im proved m arkedly com pared to the 1970s.  That said, the difficulties in estim ating productivity trends should not be underestim ated.  They in clude inferri ng recen t trend breaks with relatively few data points, separating “cyclical ” from  secular fluctuations, m aking assum ptions about the rate of t echnological progress going forward, and measuring capita l services for conce ptually complex hardwa re/sof tware bundles. These difficulties leave plenty of scope for reasonable individuals to disagree. Charlie S teindel f rom the Federa l Reserve Bank of  New York will now continue the presentation.

MR. STEINDEL . Thank you. I’d also like to thank Don and Sandy for giving m e the opportunity to speak today.  It seems m y job is to talk about a less optim istic period of productivity perform ance. As we all know, productivity growth  in the nonfarm business sector was noticeably slower from  1973 to 1995 than  in earlier or later periods.  The transition to slower productivity growth appears to have been gradual.  Labor 6/26-27/01 18 productivity growth in the years from 1967 through 1970 was low by the standards of the postwar period. There was a resurgence in 1971-72, but 1973 saw a drop to the lower num bers that becam e custom ary through the mid-1990s.  Table 1 shows m easures of  productivity for various subperiods since 1960. We can see that the dow nshift in productivity growth after 1966 through 1973 was widespread across s ectors.  Nonfinancial corporate productivity growth m oved in line with the total, though m anufacturing productivity rem ained rather strong. Developm ents in various  multifactor productivity  measures in  the late 1960s and early 1970s were sim ilar to t hose in labor productivity.  Chart 1, on the next p age, shows the annual es timates of multifactor pr oductiv ity growth for nonfar m business m ade by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  There were several years of negative m ultifactor grow th in th e late 1960s and a very b rief 1971-72 rev ival.  From  our vantag e poi nt tod ay, the slowdown in m ultifactor productivity growth in the years in the late ’60s appears to be a good indication that the basic pr oductivity trend was beginning to falter.  However, as Dan noted earlier, such estim ates of mutifactor productivity depend very heavily on d etailed, def initive data that sim ply were not ava ilable at tha t time. Contem porary observers were well aware of the sluggishness in productivity in the late 1960s, especi ally in 1969.  Nonetheless, there apparently was a widespread belief that productivity growth would rebound to the trends of the 1950s and early 1 960s.  Table 2 pulls statem ents from reports of the Council of Econom ic Advisers from 1967 through 1971.  They continually asserted that the longer-term  trend in productivity growth was 2­1/2 to 3 percent. The transition from  the Johnson to the Nixon Adm inistration only seem s to make a difference in the boilerplate language or where the d iscussion of productivity  was placed in the report; the num bers were generally the sam e. Of course, the inability to detect th e shift in the productivity trend was likely com pounded by the exceptional tur bulence of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Just to rem ind everybody, m ajor ev ents included:  the Vietnam  War, large swing s in federal ta xes, substan tial expansion of federal regulations and entitlem ent program s, the collapse of  the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates and gold prices, a pe riod of widespread wage and price controls, the first oil shock, and sharp sh ifts in m onetary policy.  Given the disruptions of the day, it is not surp rising that low productivity growth was often dism issed as reflecting short-te rm disruptions--in 1969, for exam ple, a shortage of skilled workers often wa s mentioned as im peding productivity-­rather than the beginnings of a more disturbing long-term  trend. There were a num ber of developm ents in the late 1960s and early 1970s, potentially observable at the tim e, which could have suggested that the productivity trend was w eakening.  First, productivity growth was weak on a 6/26-27/01 19 number of occasions, g iven the overall state of the econom y.  Chart 2 sho ws the results of a num ber of rolling regressions I ran of productivity growth on output grow th.  These regressions were  estim ated year by year over samples ending in the late 1960s; the regressi ons were m oved forward every year-­extrapo lating forward a further year and seeing h ow the forecast com pared with actual productivity. The forecast line is shown in red and the actual productivity change, Q4 to Q4, is shown in blue. While the errors were mostly rather m odest, we see repeated  cases where the projected productivity growth was greater than act ual growth in the late 1960s, and the shortfall in 1969 was rather large. However, as we  all know, such regressions are subject to norm al sampling error of som e magnitude.  In any event, these regressions were back on track from  1970 to 1972. Profit trends and equity m arket developm ents provide som e further evidence that productivity growth was deteriorating in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As Chart 3 shows, current-dollar profits of nonfinancial corporations dropped substantially as a shar e of sectoral output  in this period.  At the tim e, one m ight have attributed th e dec line in the p rofit share to so me of the special forces th en at work, besides of course the recession in 1970:  the upward trend in nom inal interest rate s, increased pension costs, increased payroll taxes, intensified foreign co mpetition, and the surge in im ported commodity prices. The recovery in th e profit share in the expansion of the mid- and late 1970s does suggest that there were som e unusual short-term factors--again, aside from the cyclic al decline--holding profits down around 1970. However, the longer-term  signal pr ovided by the profit slum p appears to have been reinforced by the stock m arket’s perfor mance.  Chart 4 sho ws the earn ings-price ratio and vario us measures of real interest rates .  The earnin gs-price ratio, in black, was little changed on balance after the m id-1960s before be ginning a prolonged uptrend in 1973.  The blue dashed line is the real funds rate, m easured as the nom inal rate less the four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  Real interest rates appear to have peaked around 1966 and drifted down for a fe w years in the late 1960s; but they were then quite volatile through the early 1970s before bottom ing out in th e middle of that d ecade.  The real 10 -year rate, shown in red and com puted on a com parable basis, behaved sim ilarly. The im pression, therefore, is that r eal rates m ay have peaked around the mid-1960s and perhaps started trending down.  This im pression is reinforced by the Board staff’s calculations of the equilibrium real rate, which shows a pronounced decline from the m id-1960s through the m id-1970s.  But that measure of the real rate, which is ba sed on current estim ates of the output gap, was not observable at that tim e.  The relation  between the earnings -price ratio and real interest ra tes depends on perceptions about the riskiness of the stock m arket and expectations of earni ngs growth.  The rise in the earnings-price ratio relative to real rates in the late 1960s, as a matter of logic, suggests  6/26-27/01 20 that investo rs eith er were  regarding the stock m arket as an increasing ly risk y investm ent or were revising downward their estimates of  future corpo rate earnings. Either adjustm ent would app ear to be consistent w ith reduced estim ates of the longer-term  productivity trend. In conclusion, the experience of th e late 1960s and early 1970s suggests that productivity trends can indeed ch ange rather unexpectedly, and it shows the difficulty of detecting such a trend shift while it is occurring.  Using our knowledge of subsequent developm ents, com parisons of observed productivity to that predicted by overall activity as well as observations of profits and the stock m arket would seem  to have provided evidence, available at the tim e, that the deterioration of  the productivity trend was under way in the late 196 0s.  However, an observ er of the day , familiar with the long record of a strong productivity grow th trend, m ay well have overlooked those signals. In sum , the experience of thirty  years ago shows us how hard it is to detect in real tim e that the productiv ity trend is shifti ng and by how m uch. That concludes our presentation, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  That was extraord inarily ef fective, g entlemen.  I think you ought to be pleased that you coordinated so well. Let m e raise a few questions m yself.  You’ve  all raised basic conceptual problem s and I think the m ajor concern that you expressed relates to  the fact that the input  data are not adjusted for intensity of use in one for m or another.  You’re working off the capital stock and you’re using depreciation as an im portant com ponent of the wei ghts used to aggregate cap ital stocks to get at capital services. You’re a ll, however, using gross product  in constant dollars as m easured by BEA. Yet a s we all know, the statistical disc repancy underwent a very dram atic widening over a protracted period and did not reverse.  As a result, real gross incom e grew significantly faster than real gro ss product d uring th e period when productiv ity growth was accelerating.  Many of the conclusions that come out of this analys is are affected by usi ng product-side data rather than incom e-side figures.  We know that gross dom estic incom e and gross dom estic product are conceptually  identical, so  we’re dealing strictly with m easurem ent questions.  More importantly, the weight of the argum ent is that while the da ta are possibly m arginally  superior on the product 6/26-27/01 21 side, that superiority is indeed m arginal.  Theref ore, robust conc lusions on issues of this nature, at least in m y judgm ent, should be those that com e out of data from  both the incom e and product sides and are effectively independent of the types of m easures used.  Even if we get beyond that que stion, there is also the pr oblem  of which we  are all aware, nam ely that im plicit in the gross product- -and in fact in the gross incom e--data are som e structural issues. In particular , there are industry produc tivity estim ates or cr oss-classifications of industry, such as corporate versu s noncorporate,  which when you squeeze the data effectiv ely produce very significant num erical howls, if I may coin an aw ful m etaphor.  Our analysis indicates, as does that of others, actu al declines in real ou tput per hour ov er the p ast few decades in significant areas of the econom y, such as health services, legal services, and repair services.  However, the gross product originating data in  nominal te rms in all of these areas are  not particularly out of line, suggesti ng that we are indeed looking at some very im portant biases in the price indices. Of course, the crucial question here is  not whether th ere are b iases but whether the biases are changing. And of that we’re not terribly certain. The cross-classification by lega l form of organization sugges ts tha t the lo cus of  the measure ment problem  is the noncorporate sect or.  So, if we look at productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector, the growth rate shift we see from the pre-1973 to the post-1973 period is actually significantly less than for the nonfar m business sector.  Let’s look at som e of the averages. For exam ple, le t’s take 1967 to l973, which is a strong productivity era, and compare it to the 1974-1995 period.  As you can s ee on the table shown by Charlie S teindel, the was for nonfarm  business.  Indeed, the sam e is true for m anufacturing.  The obvious inference from  those data--which, as I indicated, has been  confirm ed--is that wh en we disaggregate the 6/26-27/01 22 data, the numbers for the noncorporat e sector behave in an entirel y noncredible way.  Therein lies the crux of the whole problem  and where a numb er of questions arise with respe ct to the robustness of som e of the resu lts presented to us today.  In my judgm ent, it m ight be useful to rerun this whole exercise us ing inc ome-side da ta and perhaps substitute for som e of the unreliable price m easures we have in our system.  For exam ple, as we all know, when people analyze se lect segm ents of the medical services area, every study alm ost invariably shows a long-term  deflation of unit m edical costs.  When we use aggregate price m easures, those costs go up.  Indee d, if one tries to infer the m ovement in the average p rice from  the nom inal gr oss output per dollar or iginating in m edical services, one gets a price d eclin e.  So, a lot of basic data adjustm ents are called f or, in order to m ake consistent the internal data system  we’re work ing with.  I think we ought to m ake those adjustm ents and then run through this kind of exercise in order to dete rmine whether or not the results are a function of the data inp uts we are employing.  Some of them will be; s ome of the m won’t be.  But before we can stretch our state of knowledge terribly far, I th ink it’s useful to know what raw material we have to put in our system .  For exam ple, I susp ect that if we spent a good deal m ore time on the capital input data, we’d com e up with a lot m ore problem s than you’re raising, Jeff, or that Dan is raising as w ell.  The ultim ate question, h owever, really boils d own to how these system s work in forecasting real GDP. The tru th of the m atter is th at they do pretty well.  So you’re co ncluding in a sense th at the system  is not jus t noise but that there’s som ething there.  Now, the aggregate size of a lot of these inter-relationships probably di dn’t m ake terribly m uch difference on the way up because they were all g oing in th e same direc tion.  They do m atter signif icantly at turning points or when we’re trying to look at the longer term .  So as I see it, there ha s been extraordinary 6/26-27/01 23 progress in the num bers system s, but som e of it makes m e a little un easy--espe cially that ch art, which, regrettably I think, de signates how we projected st ructural productivity Greenbook by Greenbook. It ought to be classified “top secret, one eye only”!  It doesn’t do well for us. I’m not sure that our retrospective vi ew is anywhere near what that set of numbers shows.  Anyway, I’ve said m y piece.

MR. STRUCKMEYER. Mr. Chairm an, may I respond?

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  By al l means.  

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. I have a couple of comm ents.  I personally like Jef f’s last chart. And rather than viewing this as a vice of the staff’s approach, we think it is a virtue.  I’d point to the Okun’s law chart, whic h is m y last exhibit, Chart 5.  When we’ve used this approach over the las t year or so, we real ly haven’t been o ff too far in our forecas ts of the unemploym ent rate. Indeed, if we use a gross dom estic incom e concept in O kun’s law, estim ated in a very similar way to the way we’ve done potential out put on the product side, O kun’s law fits about the same as shown in this chart.  We haven’t done that recently, but when we’ve done it in the past, the two m ethods haven’t diverged greatly.  They may diverge at turning points, as you suggest.  That’s som ething we haven’t looked at but we ca n do so.  At any rate, we think this method has served us in pretty good stead over the last year in helping us to understand what really has been going on in the econom y and in keep ing our inflat ion and outp ut forecasts on track with those developm ents. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Sandy, let m e just ask you this.  I vague ly recall that we used to em ploy Okun’s law to estim ate potential.  If you start in that direction and work backwards, it’s going to generate this particular relationship.   

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. Well, it is an  iterative process.  [Laughter] 6/26-27/01 24

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I appreciate your--

[SECTION]

MR. SICHEL. Mr. Chairm an, let m e add one  thing on the incom e-side num bers.  In addition to the m aterial we presented, we have  done this analysis us ing the gross domestic incom e data.  I can tell you what that woul d produce for Chart 3, which shows that labor productivity growth picked up from  1.5 percent in the earlie r 1973-95 period to 2.8 percent in 1995-2000 period, for a pickup of 1.3 percentage points.   If we rerun that using gross dom estic incom e, the pickup would be about 0.3 percentage point m ore.  So, as the Chairm an said, there incom e side, there would  be a bit m ore of a pick up in m ultifactor productivity to explain.  Indeed, the Council of Econom ic Advisers in the way th at they do th ese decom position s in their an alysis will typ ically average th e incom e side and the p roduct sid e in looking at the num bers, taking a very agnostic view as to which is m ore correct. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Mr. Chairm an, m ay I m ake one comm ent about Jeff’s picture as well?   What Jeff hinted at in his remarks, but it doesn’t actually show in th e char t, is th at the techniqu es that he used --and inde ed that we us ed ourselve s before las t summer--were  techniqu es that in a period of i mproving produc tivity are going to re sult in a series of persistent one-sided errors. That is in fact w hat we were observing in our own forecasts for a considerable period of time.  So it didn’t seem  to us to be a reasonabl e approach to take as a baseline, given that it almost certainly would result in that kind of pattern.  We recognized, as S andy said, w hen we shifted to ou r current app roach, th at by tying our  potential ou tput forecas t much m ore close ly to our investment forecast we were going to create a series th at would m ove around a great deal.  I don’t take the up and down m ovement in our estim ates that we’ve seen thus far over the last year necessarily as a defeat o f the basic approach.  While proving more  variable, like our forecast, it 6/26-27/01 25 performance.  So I think the ju ry is s till ou t.  Obviously, we felt in so me sense that it was very difficult to present a forecast to the FOMC ti me after tim e in which an in vestm ent forecast im plied som ething about the p ace of capital deepening but w e then divo rced that forecast from  our estim ates of structural productivity.  That was the concern that led us in the direction of trying to tie those concepts closer together.  What has happened, obviously, is that our inv estment forecast has been off by a ton over the p ast year. We moved to this techniqu e probably just at the tim e of our  peak forecast of investm ent and have been revising it down since then. So I th ink Jef f is entirely f air to presen t this char t because it in deed reflects our reco rd.  On the other hand, I don ’t think it necessarily req uires us to put an “eyes only” over it and never show it to anybody.  In fact, I feel quite comfortable explain ing it and def ending this pa ttern of  errors to the Committee or to pe ople outs ide the Comm ittee as well.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Well, m aybe the problem  is that we’re using the term “productivity” to explain all of this but what you ’re explaining is the use of a structural m odel to forecast certain in ternal variab les that are the determ inants of the level of output in the relatively short run. The words one uses to explain it probably  are not really relevant .  In fact, it’s quite conceivable that what you’re doi ng is really quite different from  what Jeff is doing--that the two of you are measuring d ifferent things.   He pres umably has a d efinition of what he m eans by structural productivity. Indeed, th at’s obviously the case if we liste n to w hat he’s doing and how he’s calculating it. But you and he are not m easuring the sam e phenom enon.  You’re measuring a different phenom enon.  It’s almost as though he has a 10-year m oving average and you have a 2-year m oving average and you’re struggling to find out why they don’t look the sam e. 6/26-27/01 26 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I think we recognize that. 

[SECTION]

MR. FUHRER. There is som e of that. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Also, the kinds of questions  one m ight want to address with these various analyses are different. I rem ember Pr esident Minehan asking early on in this process about wheth er we would use this for a 10-year forecast.  We indicated “no ,” because w e’re thinking in som e sense about a highe r frequency notion of what is st ructural.  We tried to adjust our language to reflect that by using different terminology--talking not a bout our view of trend productivity but our view of stru ctural productivity.  And in the l onger-term  simulations that we present to th e Comm ittee, that estimate of stru ctural productivity varies  over tim e, depending on the longer-term  outlook for capital  investm ent or the relative price of capital equipm ent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  I might add parent hetically that we often show negative numbers for multifactor productivity .  If we trul y mean that as knowledge or som e form of technical capability, the presum ption that we forg et the wheel or som e particular m ajor advance somehow just doesn’t seem --  

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. But that num ber is not just knowledge.  It’s knowledge plus errors and cyclical behavior, too. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, even if you cyclically adjust it, you can still get negative numbers. I would call it errors pl us knowledge rather th an the other way around. 

[SECTION]

MR. FUHRER. At some risk--m aybe when the Chairm an speaks for m e, I should just keep m y mouth shut and  leave well enough alone--I just  want to try to clarif y one point.  And that is that I don’t think we’re actually as f ar differe nt in our concept of wh at productivity is as you might be suggesting.  I would not as an operational m atter use sim ple long-run linear trends to figure out structural productivity. In fact, the reason I believ e that  productivity grow th 6/26-27/01 27 accelerated over tim e is precis ely because we had sustain ed bursts of inv estment that actually did add capital services because those services em bodied new technology.  So that concept, I think, is absolutely right. The question is only about shor t periods, when we im pute productivity surges that are s tructural becau se of investm ent bursts that m ay not deliver cap ital s ervices in the way that the m odel says they would.  Then there’s so me scope for applying judgm ent to adjust those estim ates, and I’m  applying judgm ent a little differen tly from the way the Board staff is as well.  But I don’t think we’re quite so different in terms of our notion of structural productivity. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Let me raise one final que stion, which rea lly ge ts to th e issue of capital stock. Our capital stock num bers are heavily influenced by decisions about what spending should be capitalized and what should be expensed or writ ten off.  Security analysts apparen tly believe that writing of f items increases  the m arket value of  a firm.  What in the world do we m ean by capital stock other than that which produces incom e in the future or, by extension, p roductivity in the future?  Therefore, those write-offs are an issue because given th e way that we tabulate cap ital deepenin g, we are e ffectively elim inating from the capital stock a number of item s that are written  off.  Brynjolfsson, for exam ple, has som e huge num bers that he applies to the capital stock on the grounds that th ese item s are not written off concurrently and thus do add to the va lue of  the f irm at a la ter date.  To be sure , that c apital will dep reciate f ast.  Average dep reciation rates will b e a lot f aster.  Nonetheless, if  the capital stock is g rowing and we never qu ite catch up, we will get a shift between m ultifactor productiv ity and capital deepening. Obviously labor productivity will be i nvariant in relation to that.  But again, it does matter for projection purposes.  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, I’d like to offer a couple of comm ents and then end with a quick question. I liked  these papers very m uch.  I thought they were quite helpful.  6/26-27/01 28 For m e at least, the bottom  line is that the confidence interval  around any current estim ate or projection of structural productiv ity growth is fairly wide.  I can’t say that the papers have actually narrowed it any. Still, it’s v ery usef ul to me to have a sense of how som e of these numbers are constructed, and I appreciate the work.     I might just say, though, that I th ink it’s worth keeping in m ind that this is the first in presum ably a series of discussions of special topi cs.  These are in som e sense a substitu te for the discussions we used to have on the money targ ets.  Once we began to deem phasize the m oney targets, we usually got into som e discussion of  the longer-term strategy of monetary policy at these so-called “Hum phrey-Hawkins” m eetings.  In my judgm ent that’s a tradition we ought to keep. In that spirit, I th ink it’s appro priate to try to draw out of this disc ussion as best we can the implications of productivity gr owth prospects for our longer-r un m onetary policy strategy.  We should determ ine the connection between the produc tivity growth trend and m onetary policy as clearly as w e can. Now, with respect to our m onetary polic y strategy, we no longer set explicit m oney supply targets and we have not as yet adopted an y definite sub stitute for th at.  But given our public com mitment to long-term  price stability, I think m ost of us  have som e implicit target ceiling for inflation that we carry around in the back of our minds--at l east I do--and it’s probably something like 2 percent on the core PCE.  So it seem s to m e that the key question here for the Comm ittee is:  What are the im plications of  changing trend productivity growth rates for achieving and m aintaining long-term price stability?   Actually, it’s interesting that from a longer-term perspe ctive if  we’r e targ eting inf lation- -even if it’s an implicit targ et--in a sens e trend productivity  growth doesn’t m atter b ecause any trend productivity g rowth  or any sustainable long-term  rate of econom ic growth is consistent with pr ice stability.   6/26-27/01 29Knowledge of trend productivity growth is very im portant, to me at least and I think to many peopl e, in term s of giving us an estim ated ra nge for the equilibrium  real funds rate at any point in tim e, given whatever situ ation we face.  We’ve talked about th is many times before:  The higher the productivity growth rate, and hence the fa ster the expected growth of future incom e, the m ore businesses and households are going to borrow m oney to try to bring som e of that expected h igher future in come forward; and hence the higher the equi librium real rate needs to be to make people and business firm s be patient and wait until th e actua l high er incom e arises.  The staff has been producing estim ates of  equilibrium  real interest rates to be used in form ulating our short-term  monetary policy settings.  I think that  has been useful, and that brings m e to m y question. I’d be interes ted in th e staff ’s estim ate of how m uch th e range of equilibrium  real rates has to change in response to a particular incr ease in trend productivity  growth.  To be m ore specific, do you have estim ates over the long run of how much the ra nge of equilibriu m real rates needs to rise when trend productivity growth in creases by, say, a percentage point?   That seem s to me one of the basic practical questions that  we need to answer to help us in conducting monetary policy. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. In som e of the papers you’ ve received over the years, and in the Bluebook this tim e, I think there ar e som e hints of that.  The mode l’s estim ates of the effect of trend produ ctivity growth on r*, the real federal f unds rate, are more than one-for-one because of the big effects on demand.  The supply effects on equity prices, on expected income, and expected earnings have a signifi cant impact on demand for consumption and investment.  So in the model, unless it’s changed of late, a 1 percen tage point increase in tr end productivity growth gives us an r* that is about 1.3 or 1.4 percentage points high er, and obviously vice versa for a reduction in productivity growth. Th is is reflected to a certain ex tent in Charts 6 and 7 of the      6/26-27/01 30 Bluebook. Those charts sim ulate higher and lowe r productivity growth.  They don’t extend long enough in tim e to give us a true trend.  But if you look, for exam ple, at the surge in structural labor productivity chart, the real f unds rate levels out at  4-1/2 percent in “the perfect foresight” case--the dotted red line. The di fference between  these is abo ut 1-1/2 percentage points, I guess, but it doesn’t go to equilibrium .  But you can see there that ev en in a few years the perfect foresight m odel takes the real rate up to about 4-1/2 percent whereas the productivity slum p case has the rate at about 4 percent, and I think it would continue to come down.  That’s not as m uch as the 1 point change, but it gi ves you som e sens e of what’s going on.  A productivity change certainly does feed through into effects on r*. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. In thinking about Jeff Fuhrer’s  chart with the highly variable structural productivity, I believe w e can m ake good sense of that if we go back to the growth accounting equation on Chart 2. In my view the problem  here is that we have tended to proceed by thinking about a potential GDP track, which involves la bor force grow th--ta king account of the demographics--and some structural labor productivity trend.  We th en add the two together.  But that can’t really be divorced from  the invest ment outlook, which is the point of the growth accounting equation. That equation s ays that pr oductiv ity, lo oking at the decom position of the growth of output, is tied intim ately to the investm ent outlook.  That is even m ore true today than it was in the past bec ause of the rela tively shor t duration of so m uch of the new capital.  So our idea of potential, which com es from  adding toge ther trends divorced from the investment outlook, is really m isleading.  To m e that is the point of em phasizing this concept, and I think that po int is absolutely r ight.  Now, we m ay not like a ttaching the word “ structural” to it bec ause 6/26-27/01 31 it seem s to change too fast, but linking it to the investm ent outlook I think is absolutely correct.  So what that says about the am ount of output that the econom y can produce, which is obviously relevant for monetary policy--and about the am ount of inflationary  pressure that m ight result given the policy that we follow--is th at it really is tied very closel y to the investm ent outlook.     As for the multifactor productiv ity, that’s no t just inform ation or the accum ulation o f knowledge. It also includes the effects of regul atory change that m ay damage productivity, such as laws that affect the en trepreneurial environm ent.  All sorts of public pol icies are going to show up in m ultifactor p roductivity, which  certainly can be  negativ e.  I’m sure m any of us believ e, for exam ple, that at tim es lawyers have damaged the productivity of the society. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  That’s why I que stion a ll of these declining output per hour figures that are im plicit in th e decom position of data for m edical serv ices and bus iness services originating in  the gross national produc t.  But I’m  equivocal on the issue of legal services. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. One of t he issues for those who try to study productivity on a sector-by­sector b asis lies in the d ifficulties of identifyi ng inputs and ou tputs sect or by sector.  I think Denison’s position was that one has to go to an aggregate lev el rather tha n to try to sp ecify productivity  sector by sector; the latter ends up b eing a lo sing gam e because of the difficulties of relating one sector to another. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Well, that’s onl y partially true because staff here addressed that question with input-output analysis and found that m any of the m easurem ent anom alies are in industries that prim arily sell to f inal users.  I noted earlier, for exam ple, that one of the problem industries is health services; but the bulk of the output of that industry goes to 6/26-27/01 32 final users. So, conceptually Denison is correct.   But as a practical m easurem ent struc ture--th e way you go about it--when you disaggregate the data, that really tells you som ething.  

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. What I’m getting at is the problem of taking aggregate productivity and assigning it to sectors. For exam ple, Bob Gordon ha s argued that it is very  difficult to sort out the productivity of the airlines from  that of the aircraft m anufacturers because changes in the quality of the aircraft affect both. Trying to distinguish how much of that is aircraft--  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That argum ent is  accurate wh en one is loo king at the contribution to the total productivity. But we do learn things about output per hour within sectors because p rofitab ility within a sector does rest on it.  Whether or not th e productiv ity in  aircraft manufacturing gives us lower input prices for aircraft services is an interesting no tion.  But it still doesn’t give us the check that this disaggregation provides.  That’s because if we get the num bers in our m easurem ents of sector productivity--irrespectiv e of what’s  going on elsewhere--that m ake no sense in ternally re lative to prof it margins within that same sector, for exam ple, that is telling us that price is very peculiarly m easured. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Right, it’s telling us that the measures of outputs and inputs are strange. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  No, actually I thin k that is a different issue than we’re discuss ing here abou t the accuracy o f the data. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Well, let m e make one other po int.  I think that perhaps what we need from  this analysis is a sense of the standard errors in this process.  How much uncertainty do we face?   Is th ere som e kind of trend or standard in vestm ent outlook th at would help us to separate out this u ncertainty abou t the cap ital accum ulation? Then the question would be: Given som e standardized investm ent outlook, wh at is the standard error for th e labor productivity?  What is the range of uncertainty? I want to ensure th at we’re not confounding our  uncertainty about the 6/26-27/01 33 capital accumulation process with  the uncertainty about the out put that com es from  a given amount of c apital. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I think that is a very  good suggestion.  One would want to know not only th e standard error of the inv ested capital accum ulation but its co varian ce with the multifactor productivity  as well. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I have no idea. No doubt th at is a very difficult thing to do, but I'm trying to distinguish the separa te aspects of this problem . 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, I'd like to ask the authors to comm ent about the paper that we all received by John Fernal d of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank.  It seem s to m e that the inclusion of adjustment costs is  theoretically a justifiable inclus ion.  In term s of that paper, it certainly res ults in a dec idedly m ore optim istic vi ew of structural product ivity going forward.  I would like to hear your views rega rding Fernald’s estim ates and also their im plications.  I must admit that Dan Sichel’s comm ent, when he indicat ed that in your approa ch you ignore the cost of adjusting capital stock, is som ewhat unsatisfyin g to m e.  I would appreciate your com menting on the paper by Fernald. 

[SECTION]

MR. SICHEL. Let m e start.  Indeed, the standard growth acco unting app roach doesn' t take account of adjustm ent costs.  The usual argu ment for that and why it evolved that way is that originally the approach was used for looking at  growth over very long periods--looking at one twenty-year segm ent compared to another twenty-year segment.  And over such long periods of time it's presum ably a reasonable assum ption to  say that the econom y within that period converged to an equilibrium  and any adjustm ent costs have w orn off.  When one takes the analysis to a higher frequency and starts to look at developments year by year, then indeed the  6/26-27/01 34 possibility that adjustm ent costs would m atter more becom es more im portant.  Certainly in periods like the early ’70s and the late ’70s there were large adjustm ent costs asso ciated with the oil price shocks that the standard approach doesn 't deal with well.  Accordingly, the standard approach was not terribly useful  for understanding those periods.  As for the Fernald paper, I found that paper very provocative.  I think, as you said, that theore tically it makes sense to cons ider adjus tment costs, and the fram ework in Fernald’s paper seem s to be the right one.  I believe he did the be st job anyone can do in an effort to estim ate how large those a djustm ent costs ar e.  But it is a very challenging task to parse out how m uch is adjustm ent cost.  When a firm  is adjusting its capital stock it is dif ficult to determ ine how m uch involves an adjustm ent to its de sired stock today as com pared w ith how much involves building a telecom  infrastructure, say, that is pu t in place to day but won' t becom e productive for a long time.  That “tim e to build” phenom enon--or the la g between the investm ent and when the actual productive impact is felt--can be di fficult to separate from  the adjustm ent costs.  So, I think that paper does the best job that can be d one, but the task is very challenging. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Well, when you th ink about how we use struct ural productivity grow th in terms of policy, it invo lves a sho rter tim eframe.  And the assum ption that I think we are making--that the adjustm ent cost is zero- -probably is not an optim al assum ption. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH .  Mr. Chairm an, I’ m prompted by your unkind remarks about lawyers to note that it was suggested that the jury is still out on these issues.  If your initial rem arks are m eant to be the charge to the jury, that jury is go ing to be out for a long time!  [Laughter]  6/26-27/01 35Charlie Steindel mentioned and I think in his presentation made clear that when a major shift in productivity is taki ng place, it’s very easy not to spot it at the time.  That, I believe, makes it important that we applaud what the Board's staff was doi ng, even though it gave rise to that interesting- looking chart. While the staff was struggling with that issue, it was very clear to the Committee that something was happening that we were having difficult y explaining and we were searching for an explanati on.  And since this is not an ec onomics class but rather a central bank trying to make monetary policy, it's crucial that we know when we’re not sure of something because then the judgmental factor in making mone tary policy becomes even more important.  If you had been giving us the impression that you really understood these pr oductivity issues more than you actually did at the time, then I think we would have been less aware of the need for judgment.  So I very much applaud what you di d.  I thought the presenta tion was excellent and the work, especially bringing to our  attention when you are less certa in than you frequently are, is an important part of helping us make policy. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. I'm interested in the following issue.  It's my impression that we have not seen this acceleration in trend or structural  productivity in any other large industrial economy, at least so far. If that's true, I think that’s potentially important because that would suggest that something unique is happening in the United States.  I'm certainly inclined  to believe that the U.S. economy is on a new and more favorable produc tivity track and I would become even more convinced if I understood why other economies have not joined in that progress.  So the question is: Have you looked at that issue and if so, what can you tell me about it? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. May I refer you to a Bulletin  article last October in which members of the Board’s International Finance Division researched that question on other industrial 6/26-27/01 36 countries?   They cam e to the conclusion that there was no convincing ev idence of accelerating productivity  growth in o ther coun tries.  They offered som e conjectu res--I hesitate to call them explanations--

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Yes, I rem ember the conclu sion and several of those conjectures as well. I guess m y question really is:  Subsequent  to the publication of th at article, do w e know anything m ore that we can say about it? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. The au thors of that article continue to upda te their database and we look to th em for addition al work on p roductivity.  But they have not in an y sense reached firm er conclusions. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  I have a w orking hypothesis that is essentially very easy to com e up with, Gary.  And that is  if multifactor productiv ity depends very much on the use of infor mation technology in order to m ake older industries be m ore efficient, the single most com petitive advantage a country can have, wh ich the United States has, is a flexible labor force. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Yes, that' s part of m y explan ation, too.  But rather than rely on m y own intuition, I was hoping that we had so me more hard and fast evidence of what either has or hasn' t been going on. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  Yes, but I think it' s really a com bination of econom ics and sociology, since what we’re observi ng is a society as well  as the pure econom ics of the situation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, we do know  that it is far more difficult to discharge workers in Europe than it is here. That's a legal question, whol ly dem onstrable, and it shows up in European unem ploym ent rates.  If a significant amount of capital investm ent is labor 6/26-27/01 37 displacing and a firm  is not able to displace labo r, then the rate of  return o n the cap ital, of necessity, is less. Hence the inclination to invest  is less.  Therefore, as you would expect--and indeed as has been the case--the degree of high-t ech investment in Europe is m uch sm aller than in our country. And if, as we look at the data  breakouts we’re exam ining, either the application of technolog y or its p roduction is a crucial part o f the productivity acceleration, one w ould assum e that the labor rigidity i ssue is all we need to know to e xplain the difference.  That is, I think, the reason you have in m ind.   

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  Gary, could I jump in on th is point?   I went th rough the article to which Karen was referring, and I think ideally what  one would like to have  is a chart like Dan’s Chart 3 for all th e other countri es--a chart that just sets out  the decom position of productivity growth. But as I rem ember, we can' t get a BL S-type breakdown of the capital stock f or other countries. Isn't that righ t?  I think th e United St ates is un ique in perm itting analys ts to do that.  So in a way, until there is m uch more disaggregated  data in these other countries, th is issue is going to have to rem ain in the dom ain of speculation.   

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. It is certainly true that it is a struggle to  get data to work with--even something as basic as hours as opposed to num ber of employees.  In the study our staff used an approach involving a set of OECD countries, and they used OECD data.  So the weakest link, if you will, is to find the data. It's certainly poss ible that if we focused our  attention on on e or two countries that produce data that they don' t all have, we could m ake som e great progress in trying to see what is going on. But we c ontinue to work on this problem . 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I would like to try to draw out  from these very interesting discussions some implications for th e near-term  forecast.  I want to focus on areas w here th e two  approaches­6/26-27/01 38 -we'll call th em the staff approach an d the Boston approach--agree and disagr ee.  I take it that the agreem ent is that currently stru ctural productivity gr owth is around 2-1/2 percent and that that represents an elevated level from  the early 1970s to m id-1990s.  The question is: Do you agree on the im plication for th e outlook --does that reflect  an ongo ing pace of innovation th at is likely to rekindle the appetite for investm ent and support som e optim ism going forward about your assum ption regarding high-tech invest ment? Is that fair to say? 

[SECTION]

MR. FUHRER. Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Now where you disa gree, I take it, is whethe r or not we believe this structural productivity growth overshot in som e sense and is now reversing.  The question is: How does that m atter in your two visions?   Let m e describe how I think the staff is looking at it, particularly if equity values and investm ent respond sharply to the driving force behind the productivity  movements--that is, the changes in the pace of innovation and so forth that m otivate investm ent and give rise to optim ism about earnings.  It seem s to me that the staff views it this way: That if the economy adjusts relatively rapidly to that, then th at gives us support for explaining why the econom y was as  strong as it was earlier.  And the reversal has im portant implications for the near-term  outlook. Do you want to reject that or--

[SECTION]

MR. FUHRER. I would be som ewhat hesita nt to draw very tight links between anybody' s specific estim ate of structural productiv ity and what the stock m arket did or didn' t do at any point in tim e.  I think a qualita tive link is there in that, yes, we in Boston believe that structural productivity has increased for the reason s you just enum erated and that at som e level it’s sensib le for the stock  market to p rice that i n.  I have no disagreem ent with that.  We are only disagreeing about how much, whether som e of th ese developm ents were transitory, and whether 6/26-27/01 39 the stock m arket should have seen through them , and so on.  That' s a matter for an academ ic debate. But there are lines of your st ory that I would certainly agree with. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH .  Mr. Stockton, please proceed. [Secretary’s note: The C hairman had left the room briefly and the Vice C hairman was recognizing the next speaker.] 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Let m e add just one comm ent to that.  With our m ore variable estim ate, we think that som e downward adjustme nt to structural productivity growth probably has occurred over the past year and that that ha s had an effect of lowering the equilibrium  real federal funds rate. For all the re asons that Jeff laid out about our  uncertainties and the confidence intervals around m any of th ese estim ates, I certainly don' t want to  lean too heavily on that reed.  But it is a piece of our analysis. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I have a question for Sandy Struckm eyer on the treatm ent of capital deepening. You m ake no attem pt to separate out cyclical from structural  changes in the case you presented. You indicated that you don' t do so because  it's not useful in som e sense, not that you don't do it because it' s too difficult or you don' t know how to do it.  But take the case of perm anent incom e growth.  Couldn’t you argue th at households, if they really had perfect foresight, should look through blips and overshooting in structural productivity due to this kind of overshooting in cap ital deepen ing because it isn' t going to be sust ained ? And, therefore, if you were really trying to get it ri ght, you would sm ooth these varia tions and end up with som ething that was m ore stab le. 

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. There are two parts to that.  The first is the investm ent part, and we thin k we' ve done that correctly.  That’s because for a concept of p otential ou tput or structural productivity, we do not want the capital stock that m ight have been in place had we 6/26-27/01 40 never had a business cycle over the postwar period.  That would be such a departu re from  reality that it really would not help us to deal with  the concepts involved.  The adjustm ent for the workweek of capital is an issue th at we want to study.  We recognize that in principle it would be bette r if we could adju st for it, but it' s very difficult to do so.  We have a capacity utilization rate that presumably could be used as a proxy fo r the m anufacturing sector.  But outside of manufacturing, it is difficult to know how hours wo rked per week are changing.  Utilization of capital in a lawyer' s office, for example, is v ery, very difficult to com e to grips with.  We could take a c rack at it, and we  will pursu e that idea.  But I per sonally am  not optim istic th at that is necessa rily going to be a critic al refinement to our m easures of  capital se rvices tha t will signif icantly change the patte rns th at we see in th e final re sults. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. Let m e make a couple of observations and then pose a different type of question about th e international dim ensions of this .  First, on the observations: I think it is very useful to have these kinds of pa pers and discussions such as this in light of our relative ignorance on the s ubject of productivity.  When I look at a tim e series that we label “productivity” and reflect on what we know or th ink we know about output  and the other inputs that produce a result such as this, I wonder what I am  suppose d to think about it from  a policym aker’s standpoint.  But, for exam ple, whe n I look at Charlie’s Char t 2 and that spike in 1971 and 1972 and the subsequent decline in 19 73 and 1974, I recall that a num ber of things were going on at the tim e that I’ve always thought  confounded any analysis of that period.  In 1972 it was reported at the tim e--I d on't know what the subs equent revis ions showed --that real output supposedly rose 9 percent that year a nd the GDP defl ator rose 2 percent.  The GDP deflator rose only 2 percent becau se that' s what Presiden t Nix on’s wage/p rice contro l program 6/26-27/01 41 perm itted.  Then in the subsequent year th e con trol program  cam e off and the pr ice index rose 9 percent or so, and the ef fect was that output plun ged.  I've always felt that we ought to average those years together if we were tryin g to draw  any conclus ions because th e data as rep orted certainly were affected b y the on-ag ain/off-again aspect of price controls .  Meanwhile, as that was going on, we had the oil price shock of ’73-’74.  I've always believed that those shocks were better thought of as real wealth lo sses.  They represented a change in international term s of trade; we m oved to a lower production po ssibility boundary.  We all remember the stories about 747s being grounded, and it had nothing to do with how  new those aircraft were.  They were econom ically obsolete given the i nput price; their econom ic life wa s shortened dram atically quite irrespective of their phys ical life and their accoun ting life.  So we got a plunge in outp ut in 1973­74. I also rem ember the m othballed alum inum  smelters around 1978-79.  Those facilities were brand new but they weren’t viable any m ore, given the level of gas pr ices.  I mention that now, of course, becaus e we’ve had v olatility in energy prices  and we' ve had som e other ra ther odd developm ents.  The State of California by itself  is the world' s fourth or fifth largest econom y and it is 15 percent of our econom y.  If it were to continue th e sam e energy policies and produce no output or a decline in output, except for sugges ting that it should secede  and not distort our data, I don' t know what I should thin k about that situation in term s of productivity.  We haven' t lost technology. We haven' t become dum ber or anyt hing like that; it' s just that the state has an incom petent governor.  So if you have any obser vations about that, I’d like to hear them.  On the inte rnationa l side, as I re ad th ese pape rs, it was easy f or me to fall into th inkin g about our econom y as a closed econom y.  But I do know--and you m entioned investm ent--that we have som e very large corporations that i nvest across the border--in C anada and Mexico and 6/26-27/01 42 even in Taiwan. And I don' t know what to th ink about the pace at which they' re transferring knowledge and technology and how th at feeds back into our econom y.  So to m ake m y question simple, suppose all innovation --all breakthroughs in technolo gy or creativity or knowledge-­occurred in the United States and that the onl y way other countries acquired a new product or knowledge was through our transferring it. How w ould that com e back into our econom y--as an increase in our wealth that would som ehow show up in a tim e series of productivity? 

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. Were there such an  innovation, m y supposition is that we would get a m ajor increa se in th e rate of return on capital.  We would see that reflected in greater profitability,  a larg er flow of capital incom e, and that would be reflected in the capital deepen ing numbers that would then boost stru ctural productivity.  And over ti me that would spread to other countries as we exported  those produ cts and as w e relocated f actories ab road because of relative wage differentials. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. So if we are im porting the final product, partial analysis would say that that' s going to enter ne gatively in our GDP num bers. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. But we are also getting capital incom e.  If you are Intel and your production facility is located in  Taiwan, there is a reflow of  incom e from  that capital. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Unless in the tim e period I' m looking at the exchange translation effects of that are swamping th at ref low of incom e.  Because we have th e innovation  going on here, our wealth increases, capital  flows in, our currency rises, and we get a lower rate of return at least for that tim e period on our foreign capital investm ent. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  There would also be a pos itive price shock that  would be exactly the rev erse o f the oil sho ck of the ’70 s because w e'd be gettin g imports more cheap ly. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. If our m easure ment is ri ght and  we get the J -curve effects. 6/26-27/01 43 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an.  I, too, found this discussion very interesting. Obviously, I talk ed with Jeff Fuhrer about these issues beforehand, but the combination of all three papers and the Chicago pa per was quite interesting.  I want to reiterate what Bob Parry said abo ut the ad justm ent costs becau se I thin k that is a fascinating to pic and it' s not dissim ilar to an issue that Jeff raised at th e end of his presentation.  What do we know about how software and hardw are work together and when  that really becom es effective?  One of your underlying assum ptions is that capital is productiv e imm ediately.  That m ay or m ay not be the case, particularly when we' re looking at short-run changes or even two- or three-year changes. One question I had relates to the period of the sp ike in the es timates of  structura l productivity growth, when we were going through what one m ight really call a “shock” in term s of investm ent spending associated w ith Y2K.  One could arguably say that a lot of the investm ent spending, or at least som e portion of it, involv ed replacing equipm ent and software that was already in place. The new investm ent would not  do anything differently but would function in a way that wasn' t going to go awry once the calend ar changed.  And som e of the investm ent involved brand new items that were also Y2K co mpliant.  Over that period of tim e, pe nt-up demand was also a factor in investm ent spending , particularly in the first quarter of 2000, when after everything worked out fine firms coul d find com puter expert s--they couldn’t find a computer person six m onths before--and finall y get som ething done and buy equipment and so forth. Has anybody tried to sort out the im pact of  Y2K-related factors from  those big investm ent numbers?  Do we have any idea what that “shock effect” was? 

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. Y2K is a very com plex phenom enon to analyze.  It is particularly com plicated  for the capital serv ices measure because there are two parts to that 6/26-27/01 44 measure.  On the one hand, there' s the capital stoc k itself and there are also  weights--rental prices or efficiency  weights--th at get attach ed to thos e various item s.  Indeed, one would expect to see the phenomenon you talked about with respect to the cap ital stock, as firm s replaced older equipm ent that probably was not as efficient as th e new equipm ent that replaced it.  On the other hand, the flow of capital incom e that all of this is  benchm arked to through th e rental price, in the way the BLS calculates it, was redu ced--I would assert  --by Y2K and the rem ediation  efforts associa ted w ith it.  People spent lots and lots  of tim e and money and pr obably reduced profits relative to where they would have  been had there been no Y2K effect.  And in the process that pulled down  the ren tal price in the we ights, which  can either f ully offset or m ore than offset the positiv e ben efits obta ined from repla cing old equ ipment with new equipment.  So I do n't think it' s a foregone conclusion, just because old equipm ent wa s replaced with new equipm ent, that in th is setting it necessarily was an enhancem ent to productivity.  When we total up all the pieces, I think the Y2K effect probably was a negative, although that is extrem ely difficult to show empirically. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. That was the thrust of m y question.   

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. We came up with a nu mber of $50 billion for what it cost corporations to rem edy their Y2K concerns in term s of labor and consultants.  That number didn' t include the c apital.  So th at would have been taken out of their flow of capital incom e and would have been reducing profits and holding down that rental price m easure.  We don' t have a full accounting for all these factors.  I don't think it' s clear that Y2K necessarily boosted capital deepening as m easured in this system. 6/26-27/01 45

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. That was the reason for m y question.  I was wondering if we m ight actually see a leveling off from the productivity growth num ber here , as a result of the negative impacts of Y2K. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. May I follow up on that?   That  answer sugg ests to m e that the way you think about that event is sim ilar to the wa y som e view the ’70s, when we had enorm ous capital expenditures--m andated expenditures--on cl ean air and clean water, but they were not output-enhancing capital expenditures. Some people at leas t asserted th at the dec line in tr end productivity growth at that tim e occurred because we were produci ng som ething, i.e. cleaner air-­or more precisely, not producing dirty air and di rty water--but the associated capital spending didn' t add to what got so ld in th e marketplace. 

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. The way BLS constructs  these nu mbers, they are part of the capital stock from  the product side obviously, but th ere is also a flow of c apital incom e from  the incom e side.  To the extent that those pollu tion abatem ent expenditures produced no profits but actually reduced profits, then that would have been  a com pensating factor in the BLS num bers.  It would already be in these data, so you would not  have to m ake a separate adjustm ent for it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Further questions?   Pres ident Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I, too, want to congratulate the authors of the papers. I thought they were all very good and I believe it was an excelle nt idea to have this as a topic for our session today. I just wanted to make a couple of co mme nts about the so-called “organizatio nal  improvem ent” portio n of multifactor produ ctivity.  The p aper def ined multifactor productivity  as a catchall for techno logical o r organizational improvem ents.  We often talk about the technol ogical side but we rarely talk about the o rganization al side, at le ast in this f orum.  Having spen t som e time in priv ate industry, I think the or ganizational side is 6/26-27/01 46 extrem ely important.  I know that som e research  studies have been done on this, but I would encourage us to do m ore work in that area.  Also, the ana lysis that we ’ve done--going back five or six years now--at the Chicago Fed about the resurgence in the Midwest econom y shows that it was due largely to the reengineer ing and restructuring of firm s, in part r elating to inf ormation technology but by no means solely. A lot of it ju st resulted from  better m anage ment--figuring out how to get things done in a m ore efficient way.   Also, I think  the term  “multifactor produc tivity” is a very difficult one for a non-econom ist to understand.  I’ve had conversations a bout this topic with la y people a num ber of times and I personally think that the term  “innovati on” is a better characte rization of what we’re talking about here. Again, I’m  using innovation in a broad sense, not just in term s of t echnology but innovation in m anagem ent and other areas as we ll.  I simply wanted to m ake that comment because I found that term inology helpful, at l east in m y conversations with non-econo mists. 

[SECTION]

MR. SICHEL. May I make just a brief comme nt?  There’s a very interesting paper by Eric Brynjolfsson and Loren Hi tt in last f all’s Journal of  Economic Persp ectiv es that provides some very nice evidence on the im portance of  organizational improvem ents.  Also, on the adjustm ent costs point that Presidents Parry and Minehan m entioned, I didn’t m ean to suggest that a zero adjustm ent is appropriate just becaus e we do it that way.  That is only a bas eline.  It’s a very sim ple, transparent fram ework that peop le understand.  I think, as you suggested, that adjustm ent costs are a very im portant issue, and the work that John Fernald did is an important first step in thinking about that.  It is som ething that I think w e need to continue to focus on.  Hence, the reason I m entioned it as one of the weaknesses of the approach as we im plem ent it. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  Thank you. 6/26-27/01 47

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I have a question that’s re levant to the measurement of output and capital. I’ve seen a lot of stories about companies that invested in equipmen t--last year, let’s say-­that didn’t work out and they are writing that equipment off at ten cents on the dollar or something like that this year.  The equipment is included in last year’s output at 100 cents on the dollar because that’s when it was produced.  What happens to it this year when it gets written off?  How is it treated in the capital stock figur es?  And how does it a ffect the national output figures this year? 

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. That’s a com plex ques tion.  I’ll tackle a piece o f it.  The equipm ent got into output when it was produced; it gets into the capital stock, as m easured by the BLS, when a com pany purchases it.  To the exten t that it ever yields a prof it, that ge ts into the incom e flows f rom the corporate sec tor that we w ill se e this year and in all subs eque nt years.  Had it paid off the way people thought it woul d, it would have produ ced a flow of capital services greater than what you’re actually going to see in the da ta when they’re finally published because basically it’ll b e in the capital stock.  But if it’s writ ten off, it is yielding zero capital services or it m ay even be  causing lo sses to the firm , which would be pulling down--  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But it isn’t written off.  It’s basically just not producing profit. The point that Pr esident Poole is m aking is that it’s a problem  of abusing the concept of gross product originating data--usin g that rathe r than net d ata and then having that item of capital destruction in the depreciation accou nts.  Maybe we ought to add to it so mething--say, econom ic destruction. 

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. Yes, econom ic obsolescence. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Econom ic obsolescence. 6/26-27/01 48

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. But the way it is tre ated in the capital stock data th at yo u use is th at it would be accum ulated--sort of a perpetual invent ory but depreciated at whatever is th e norm al depreciation rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. Right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It actually end s up as lower multifactor productivity  or, excuse m e, innovation. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. But I gather that the reason fo r the sharp drop in productivity this year might have to do in part with the fact that com panies are writing off capital--at leas t some of this capital is eq uipm ent--faster th an the depreciation  assum ptions  you have b uilt in.  So there’s capital in your capital stock figures that com panies in fact aren’t using.  Is that right? 

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. So that will show u p as reduced  productivity from  capital. 

[SECTION]

MR. STRUCKMEYER. Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. But that capital has b een sold  and purchased a t a lower p rice and is yielding a very good yield for t hose com panies that bought it. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Well, it depends on the nature  of the capital.  Those com panies m ight be getting a yield on it that’s wort h 10 cents on the dollar, but it’s be ing carried as if it’s worth a lot m ore than 10 cents on the dollar in the cap ital stock data that the staff is using.    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Well, I think th at’s absolutely right.  What you’re thinking of is what actually appears on the books  of the com pany.  The property accounts added up from the IRS returns will produ ce a dif ferent set of num bers f rom the capita l stock we use because the for mer does include write-offs.  National incom e accounts do n’t pick that up. 6/26-27/01 49

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. But the p oint of  the q uestion is  that som e of what we called output last year-- and it entered our data as  100 cents on the dollar--in  fact hasn’t turned out to be useful because it is  being written off this year to 10 cent s on the dollar.  So in tru th we produ ced less las t year than we thought because part of wh at we produced turned out to be junk. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. We should have ca lled it consumption last year. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Or waste or som ething.  That’s  my point.  Some of this huge spike in measured productivity is perhaps a consequence of overstating output last year, but som e of that is showing up this year. That’s the way the data system  works . Is that right? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  Just on this point, you al ready write com puter software off in a four-year period, don’t you?   It has a very rapid depreciation. 

[SECTION]

MR. SICHEL. Three to five years, depending on the type of software. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  So the point is true, but it’s not going to be with us very long. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. No, that’s right. But what I’m focusing on is trying to understand the most recen t data and ho w that bears on our outlo ok right now .  That’s wh at I was ge tting at with my question. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. But, Bill, isn’t p art of your p oint th at no capital service is being gained from  this investm ent and that’s w hy it ends up looking as though there’s really no productivity  improve ment?  That’s b ecause there’ s no serv ice that gets paid off from  this investm ent. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Or it’s 10 cents on the dollar, right. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. It’s creating an expense. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Right. 6/26-27/01 50

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. So it’s really a problem of se rvice being generated as opposed to the accounting concept, which is the definition of  service here. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. And it also und erestim ates the multifactor productivity number because that’s picked up in the residual .  So it can d istort the projections.  Any other comments or questions? 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I’d like to go back to Gary Stern’s question about other countries and focus on Europe. I realize m ost of this is a bout structural productiv ity rather than total productivity. What about the idea of “give gr owth a chance”?  During our period of rapidly increasing productivity monetary policy was fairly easy.  We were probably getting ready to tighten and then the East Asian crisis cam e along and we didn’t tighten.  And then the Russian situation cam e along and we actually eased a bit.  As I recall, during m ost of this period Europe was m oving toward the euro and trying to get the Maastricht conditions sett led, so their m onetary polic ies wer e all rath er tight.  Then th ey star ted trying to im prove their credibility.  Is it possible that part of the answer is that m onetary policy in  Europe has been too tigh t, par ticularly rec ently-­that policy has just not given enough room  for their econom ies to grow ? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I think that would be sayi ng that they are m isjudging, as it were, how much growth they could  in fact expe rienc e and still no t get in flationa ry pr essures. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I was thinking th at in som e sense we accidentally found out what our econom y was capable of doing. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON.  That is true. I certainly --and many others--have challenged our European counterparts not to be he ld hostage to the num bers from  the past and to be open to the concept that their econom ies could grow m ore rapidly and not encounter inflationary outcom es that would b e unaccep table at som e point.  Then along cam e the oil p rice increase and the 6/26-27/01 51 weakness in the euro, so that perhaps has clouded the opportunity for them to realize that their economies actually could grow faster using information technology even if they use it less completely and less successfully than the United States .  So in some sense the jury is still out.  If it turns out that Europe experiences some accelerati on in its growth five or six years later than this country did, part of it will probably be the re sult of the timing issues.  But it’s certainly not the case that observed inflation is surprisingly lo wer anywhere in Europe.  So the Europeans have not reached a point where they believe in the capability of their own economies to grow more rapidly without inflation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay, why don’t we  take a coffee break?  Let’s try to keep it to ten minutes if we can. [Coffee break] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Given the availabili ty of these colorful charts and staff advisors, it appears that we have a Chart Show coming up.  Mr. Stockton. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  If the Vice Chairm an found the last p resentation a refres hing adm ission of ignorance, wait un til he hears this Chart Show!3 [Laughter] As you know from  reading the Greenbook, we  continue to believe that the econom y is barely growing at present.  Real GDP--the black line in the upper left panel of your first ch art--has decelerated sharp ly from  its rapid  pace of early 2000.  That slowdown has been am plified by a substantial inventory correction, but the growth of real final sales --the red line--also has move d down m arkedly, on net, in recen t quarters.  We have received two i mportan t pieces of infor mation s ince th e forecast was com pleted last W ednesday--in ternational trade figures for April and, this m orning, a reading on new orders a nd shipments of capital goods in May; the implications  of these data for our forecast are sho wn at the rig ht.  Revision s in the trade data point to even weaker growth of real GDP in the first quarter--about 0.8 percent at an annual rate instead of th e 1.2 percent we showed in the Greenbook.  This m orning’s figures on orders and shipm ents were in line with our expectations and leave our estim ate of growth in the cu rrent q uarter at abo ut 2 perc ent. For the year as whole, we now expect real G DP to increase 1.4 percent, just a touch lower than in the Greenbook forecast. 3 Copies of th e Chart Sho w materials are appe nded to this tr anscript.  (Appendix 3) 6/26-27/01 52With the growth of real output proj ected to run well be low the growth of potential into next year, the unem ploym ent ra te is expected to rise from  its current level of 4-1/2 percent to a bout 5-1/2 percent next year. Overall PCE  inflation, the black line at th e right, is expected to drop from  the 2-1/4 percent rate posted last  year to about 1-3/4 percen t in 2002. That deceleration large ly reflects our an ticipation tha t consum er energy prices will be f alling noticeably in com ing quarters.  Core pri ce inflation, the red li ne, basically m oves sideways at just under a 2 percen t rate.  The deceleration of structural prod uctiv ity in the staff projection, discussed by S andy a nd Dan, is a source of upward pressure on price inflation over the pr ojection inte rval.  But the indirect effects of fa lling energy prices and the em ergence of slack in labor and product m arkets are expected to keep a lid on core  inflation through 2002. Clearly, the extent of the weakness in the econom y has com e as a surprise to most forecas ters.  As seen at the lower left, the Blue Chip pan el has m arked down its forecast f or real GDP growth in 2001 by about a percentage point since January, while m aking only a m arginal adjustm ent to their outlook for 2002.  Our forecast-­the lower rig ht panel--a lready was well be low the consensus in January, but we too have revised down a bit further our projecti on for growth of real output this year.  Like the Blue Chip, we have revised up our forecast for in flation this year, but have not changed our outlook for 2002. Your next exhibit highlights the two rela ted influences that have m ost shaped the very rocky econom ic perform ance that we  have experienced since late last year-­inventories and capital goods. Earlier this  year, we had expect ed the sharp cutbacks in production that began last fall to ha ve largely elim inated most inventory overhangs by early sum mer.  As you can see in the upper two panels, that has not happened. Inventory-sales ratios for hi gh-technology products--the left panel--have soared in recent m onths, and those in th e non-tech sector--the right panel--have, on net, edged up further. Firm s in the aggr egate have been liquidating stocks since about the turn of the year. But virtually all of that liquidation has com e in the non-tech sector. For tech pro ducts, inv entory accum ulation app ears to have crested th is spring, but the bulk of the liquidation pha se for that sector still lies ahead. The collapse in investm ent has ce rtainly weighed on final dem and and contributed to inventory probl ems.  As seen in the m iddle left panel, orders and shipm ents of com puters and communications  equipm ent have plumm eted in recent months. And the outlook for investm ent in other equipm ent--shown to the right-­has deteriorated as well. Revised data now  indicate that orders have been running well below s hipments since the turn o f the year, implying order backlogs have been drawn down. All in all, it ’s a very weak picture. As a result, we now anticipate that industrial production will fall sharply through th e third quarter,  and recovery w ill only take hold early next year as 6/26-27/01 53 inventories are cleared out and dem and begi ns to firm .  In the technology equipm ent sector--the lower left panel--production is expected to decline into the autum n.  Com puters and sem iconductors should turn  up before the end of this year, but communications equipm ent is no t expected to po st any gains until 2002.  Outside of technology and m otor vehicles, we are expectin g deep cuts in production to continue through the summer before out put reaches bottom toward year-end.  The subsequent recovery that we are projecting for next y ear is a weak one by historical standards. Your next chart highlights a few sector s that have, thus far, prevented the weakness in capital spending and industrial  production from  tipping us into outright recession. Light veh icle sales, shown  in the upper left panel, h ave held up very well. And reports for early June suggest that the sales pace h as not yet slackened appreciably. To som e extent, automake rs have been holding up sales through the use of m ore generous incentives.  Even with some further sw eetening of incentives, we expect th e deceleratio n of incom e and the weakening of household wealth to result in som e drop-off in com ing quarter s.  As seen to the right, prom pt and aggress ive cuts in produ ction su cceeded ear lier this year in curbing m otor vehicle invento ries, but if our sales forecas t is corre ct, further cu ts will be necessary in the second half. Housing star ts--the m iddle lef t panel--also hav e been well m aintained this year.  Low m ortgage interest rates have largely o ffset negative incom e and wealth effects, and we are projecting resident ial con struction ac tivity to b e little ch anged over the remainder of the year. Consum er spending, shown in the panel at  the right, has surprised us to the upside. Still, af ter a jum p early in th e year, real spending has been on a shallower trajectory than was the case over the past few years.  Moreover, we think that the slower pace of spending would have been  even more noticeab le by the second half of the year absent th e effect of the tax cuts--the b lue line in th e chart. While I hate  to throw co ld water on e ven these few war m spots in th e eco nomy, it is wor th pointing ou t that the se sec tors are not likely to pr ovide m uch upward mom entum  to activity in com ing quarters.  We think m otor vehicle production will be a slight n egativ e, hou sing will be r oughly flat,  and consumer spending will be restrained by funda mentals that are only being of fset by the tax cut. The risks surrounding that outlook are likely to be further tested by the softening under way in labor m arkets.  As seen in the lower left panel, a f our-week moving average of initial claim s for unem ploym ent insur ance has m arched stead ily higher thus far this year. Accom panying that deteriorati on has been a sharp slowing in private payrolls. As seen by the black line at the right, m anufacturers and related firms in wholesale trade and help sup ply have been shedding workers at a progress ively faster rate since last y ear.  And in recent m onths, we have s een evidence that em ploym ent increases in private service-producing industries have stepped dow n considerably.  All told, we antic ipate tota l private payrolls to shrink 6/26-27/01 54 by about 100,000 per month this summer, with a pickup in em ploym ent only occurring early next year. From  this current position of weakness, it looks like a long way to get to the 3­1/2 percent growth that we have project ed for 2002.  And, indeed, we expect the period imm ediately ahead to be touch a nd go with respect to whether the econom y can avoid outright declines  in aggregate output.  Assum ing it does, the ev entual cessation of inventory liquidation should provide a boost to production, employm ent, and incomes.  Moreover, we s ee two other considerable pluses for the econom y--the stim ulus from  monetary policy and fiscal policy--the  subjects of your next two charts. As shown in the upper panel of chart 4, the recent easing of  monetary policy has restored an upward tilt to the yield cu rve, after last yea r’s inversion.  The considerable declin e over the past year in both long-term  and short-term  interest rates should help buoy activity by easing balan ce sheet strains and lowering the cost of capital to businesses a nd households.  But other elem ents of the financial configuration are not so suppor tive as interest rates.  In equity m arkets, the price-earnings ratio, shown in the m iddle left pa nel, has generally moved lower over the past year, even as real inte rest rates have com e down.  Moreover, the real exchange value of the dollar, show n at the right, m oved s till higher over this period. The lower left panel reproduces the Bluebook chart that sum marizes these various factors in the form  of an estim ated range for the equilibrium  real federal funds rate--the shaded area. The actual real funds rate has now fallen below its historical av erage and b elow our estim ates of  the equilibrium  real rate.  Of course, while the actual real funds rate has fallen, so too has the equilibrium  rate, suggesting somewhat less stim ulus from  the current se tting of policy than m ight be judged from move ments in the funds rate alone.  In the panel to the right, we use the F RB/US model to parse out its estim ated 120 basis poi nt decline in the equilibrium  funds rate since the m iddle of last year.  About half the decline refl ects increases in the equity prem ium and the exchange rate.  The other half of the declin e large ly reflects the drop in estim ated structural  productivity growth.  While the range of uncertainty surrounding any of these estim ates is large, we do think the anal ysis suggests that monetary policy will be a source of stimulus to activity going forward. The sam e can be said for fiscal policy, th e subject of your next chart.  The tax plan sign ed by the Pres ident was sim ilar in its elem ents to the one we incorporated in the May Greenbook, though a bit less gene rous in the near term  and m ore generous next year. The key elem ents are described in the upper left panel.  A tax rebate of $38 billion will be paid out betw een July and September.  A perm anent tax reduction of $3 billion will take place this  fiscal year and a $71 billion cut is scheduled for fiscal 2002. As I am  sure you can appreciate, we had to engage in a process that was as much art as science as w e built into our pr ojectio n the effects  of these cuts in tax es 6/26-27/01 55 on private spending and produc tion.  As noted to the right, we m ade a number of key assum ptions each of which is a g ross simplification of a com plex reality.  We assum ed that for som e households consum ption tracks cash f low closely, and they are assum ed to spend tax rebates and pe rmanent tax cuts reasonably fully over several quarters. Other households will spe nd only a sm all fraction of th eir rebate checks and will ad just s pending slo wly to their incre ases in af ter-tax inc omes.  Finally, some of the initial effect of the boost to spending will be absorbed by a drawdown of inventories. The effects of the em pirical im plementa tion of these assum ptions on the level of real GDP are dep icted in the g raph at the m iddle left.  The b lack so lid line shows the effects o f the tax cut on invento ry investm ent; the red sh aded area sho ws the estim ated sp ending effect; and the red solid li ne shows the total effect on the level of real GDP. As can be seen, we expect the initia l jum p in spending stim ulated by th e tax cuts to b e partly m et in the s econd half of the year by a drawdown of inventories. Moving into 2002, the next in stallm ent of the perm anent cut m aintains the stim ulus to spending, and businesses s hould, all else equal, m ove to replenish inventories. Taken together , these influences push up the level of real G DP through much of next year. The panel to the ri ght sim ply converts the level effects on GDP shown at the left into growth rate contri butions.  As you can s ee, the effects on the growth of real GDP are largest in the s econd half of this year, but they remain positiv e through m ost of 2002. Governm ent spending also boosts activ ity over our projection period.  Real federal purchases--the red bars in the lowe r left p anel--are projected to accelerate this year to a 3 percen t annual pace and to increase a bout 3-1 /2 percen t in 2002.  Purchases by state and local governm ents--the dark bars--are expected to be reasonably well m aintained over the projec tion period.  Many of these governm ents are now experiencing som e revenue shortfal ls associated with the slowdown in activity. However, assum ing that there is  a pickup in spending and incom es next year, overall fiscal positions rem ain strong enough to tide these governm ents over during this period without a sharp curt ailment of c urrent spending plans. At this point, we no longer see further subs tantial fiscal stim ulus as a m ajor risk to our projection. The federal budget surplus is expected to be $185 billion in fiscal year 2001 and $214 billion in fiscal 2002. But the on-budget portion has dwindled to between $20 and $40 billion this year and next, and if  you take out the Medicare Hospital Insurance trust fund, the surplus ava ilable for spending or tax cuts is just about gone. With that, I’ll turn the pres entation over to David W ilcox. 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  As Dave noted, the tax cut has been a key influence on our thinking about the near-term  projection.  Almost all of the rebate checks should be mailed out over a ten-week period beginning the week of July 23rd. As shown in the upper left panel of Chart 6, we are assum ing that spending out of the rebates--the 6/26-27/01 56 gray portion  of the bars- -will p rovide an im portant lif t to PCE during the  next th ree quarters, with the largest effect in the four th quarter of this year.  As shown by the red portion, the perm anent cuts likely will ha ve only a barely percep tible influence this year, but next year they should co me into their own as a second and more substantial round of rate  reduction com es on line. The upper right panel shows the influence of  the tax cuts on the growth of real PCE. Abse nt the tax stimulus, as shown by the red line, we would have PCE growth slowing further in the third quarter to less than 1 percen t at an annual rate, before picking up som ewhat through the rest of th e forecast period.  But if the tax-related stimulus plays out as we expect, the quart er just ending will mark the trough in terms of PCE growth, and spending should accelerate in the th ird and especially fourth quarters of this year. Over the lon ger term, the personal sa ving rate helps to anchor our PCE projection. The m iddle left panel outlines a few recent and p rospective in fluences on the saving rate. First, with som e crack detective work, our Flow of Funds Section discovered that BEA has been unde restim ating e mployer contributions to private pension plans since 1995. By last  year, the m iss had ram ped up to roughly $50 billion. BEA has indicated to us that the problem  won’t be fully addressed until 2003, when they next publish a com prehensive revision of the NIPAs.  Second, BEA announced earlier this year that data from  the Une mploym ent Insurance system  show about $75 billion m ore in wa ge and salary incom e in 2000 than is curren tly ref lected in th e NIPAs.  This one will g et fixed next month, with the publication of the regular annual revision. As shown in the m iddle right panel, all else equal--a very im portant caveat w hen thinking about possible revisions to the saving rate--these two factors sugg est that the actual saving rate is higher than the measured saving rate, and by enough to put it  back into positive territory.  More important, these adjustm ents re move a little bit of downside risk from  the outlook. Over the pro jection per iod, the var ious provis ions of  the tax cu t will cause the saving rate to bounce around, as households smooth their spending in th e face of choppy incom e.  And, we expect the revers e wealth effect to be putting som e upward pressure on the saving rate. By the end of next year, once the tax cut effects have largely played out, the saving rate-- shown as the black line in the bottom panel--should have settled at the somewh at higher level im plied by our projected ratio of wealth to incom e, which we ha ve shown here as a three-year m oving average, on an inverted s cale. Your next chart turns to the subject of whether th ere is a cap ital overh ang.  You have received a staff report on this is sue, which, I should say, benefited from  the help that several Reserve Banks provided in  facilitating conversations with business contacts. The top panels summarize the key econom etric results.  For each of two types of equipm ent--high-tech and other--w e estimated a targ et lev el of th e capital stock, show n in each panel with a red line,  which we assum ed to be a function of variab les su ch as the lev el of output and the cost of capital.  Then we compared the 6/26-27/01 57 targe t to the actua l capita l stocks, which we show with black lines.  If the actual capital stock  exceeds the target, we say th ere is a capital overhang, and in dicate it with gray shading. By this m ethod, whic h obviously is im precise and subject to a slew of caveats, we estim ate that firm s are holding roughly 20 percent more high-tech equ ipment than they would prefer, th e left panel, and about 10 percent m ore other equipm ent than they would like, the ri ght panel.  One thing to say in favor of these es timates is that th ey do seem  to line up reasonably well with the views of our business con tacts. An interes ting rela ted is sue is th e role that network-type m arkets m ight play in generating capital overhangs. The m iddle left panel traces through why this m ight be so. As you know, markets that involve netw ork effects tend to tip toward one provider, because everyone wants to bel ong to the network th at has the largest number of users.  Each com petitor in  such a m arket will therefore have a strong incentive to invest aggressively in th e early going, to im prove its chances of becom ing the dom inant player.  If several fi rms each inves t on a sufficien t scale to serve m ost of the potential m arket, a capit al overhang is alm ost sure to result. This kind of dynam ic may help explain re cent developm ents in the m arket for long-haul optical fiber. As is shown in  the m iddle right panel, capacity in this industry has exploded in the last  five years--by so m uch as  to challenge our graphics software, even with a ratio scale! [Laught er] Moreover, the volum e of fiber in the ground--the black line--only begi ns to tell the story; the devices attached to either end of the fiber are also very im portant fo r determ ining the capacity of the network.  As shown by the red line, we estim ate that if cutting-edge devices were installed on all the fiber in the ground today, the effe ctive capacity of the network would be multiplied b y roughly six.  This evid ence, along with a raft o f conversations that we’ve had over the past few weeks, convinces us that there is indeed a glut in long-haul fiber that could take quite som e time to absorb. The bottom  panel summarizes the m ain conclusions of our study.  First, we believe there is a capital overhang toda y.  Second, we believe that the overhang disproportionately involves high-tech equipm ent.  Given the faster depreciation of high-tech equipm ent, this conclusion s uggests that today’s overhang m ay have a shorter half-life than would otherwise be the case.  Third, for most firm s, financial factors seem not to be a m ajor drag on capit al expenditures.  To be sure, som e firms are having more trouble raising m oney t oday than a few years ago, but in m any cases th at seems mainly to reflect the ab sence of a viable business plan.  Finally, with rega rd to the im plications of  the overhang for m onetary policy, we think there are two m ain points to be m ade:  First, we think the overhang is only a moderately negative influence on the outlook. Put sim ply, even if we could som ehow take the overhang away immediately, we would still ha ve a weak pro jection for real activ ity.  Second, we believe that the overhang is not likely to noticeably im pair the effectivenes s of m onetary  policy.  If monetary po licy worked prim arily by influencing the dem and for equipm ent, we m ight think otherwise.  But m onetary policy works on a wide variety of sp ending, including housing, PCE, and net 6/26-27/01 58 exports, through a num ber of channels in fi nancial m arkets.  Moreover, we never have been able to dem onstrate a vigor ous channel operating through cost-of-capital effects on investm ent spending, especially in  the short run.  Therefore, despite the capital overhang, we believe th at monetary policy will be ab out as effective in the curren t easing cycle as it has been in  previous easing cycles. Your next chart turns to the broader topic of the outlook for investm ent.  A good deal of concern has focused on the volum e of debt that was issued to finance the investm ent boom  of the late 1990s.  But, as shown by the black line in the upper left panel, interest expense rem ained onl y a m oderate source of pressure on cash flow through the first quarter of this year for the nonfinan cial corporate sector as a whole. To be sure, as shown by the re d line, the telecom  service firm s, which collectively have seen a doubli ng of their interest burden in  just five years, are a notable exception. Similarly, as shown in th e upper right panel, the expected default frequency h as increased much m ore sharpl y for the telecom  service firm s than for the nonfinancial corporate sect or as a whole.  We interpret these data as suggesting that, for m ost firm s, fina ncial consider ations will not shar ply curta il capital spending. That said, a sobering reassessm ent of pros pects for the telecom sector m ay have helped put the spark to the tinde r last year, bu t once the f ire was going a trad itional accelerator dynam ic appears to h ave taken over, as is illu strated in the m iddle panel.  As the growth of business output slowed in the second half of last year and into the first half of this year, firm s cut the grow th of their real spending for non-high-tech equipm ent and software sharply.  And while we believ e that som e of the extrao rdina ry weakness in this se ctor will abate later this ye ar, a reviv al in E&S spending m ay not be on s olid footing until som etime next year when it be comes more evident to firm s that bus iness output is reaccelerating. Turning to nonresidential investm ent, some crosscurrents are influencing the outlook. Activity in drilling and m ining ha s been boosted by the high prices of oil and natural gas, and spending by utilities  has been supported by the need for new electricity generating capacity. But as s hown in the lower lef t panel, thes e two sectors acco unt for only about a fifth  of overall n onresiden tial investm ent.  Moreover, as shown at the lower right, prospects for the sector overall are m uch dimm er than in the past year or two, reflecting among other fa ctors a widespread notching up in the vacancy rate for office and industrial space. Your next chart turns to the outlook fo r inflation.  As you know, the growth of structural productivity--shown in the upper left panel--is one of the key building blocks in our thinking about the prospect s for inflation. You m ay be relieved to learn that I plan no further dissertation on that topic toda y, other than to no te tha t fluctuations in structural productivity growth shape our estimate of the “short-run” or “effective” NAIRU, s hown in the uppe r right panel.  Indeed, given our anticipated path for stru ctural  productivity, we expect the effectiv e NAIRU to rise to about 5-1/4 percent by the m iddle of next year.  This im plies that the projected rise 6/26-27/01 59 in the unem ploym ent rate puts a bit less downward pressure on inflation than one might otherwise have thought. In addition to lower resource utilization, a num ber of other factors influence the contour of the price forecast over the next year and a half.  One factor helping to reduce core inflation is a moderation in  energy prices, which--as shown in the middle left panel--now seem s to be well in  train.  If it cont inues as we expect, energy prices should take about 0.2 percentage  point off the change in core inflation from  this year to next.  In addition, as shown in the m iddle right panel, near-term inflation expectations seem to have he ld about steady over the last six m onths, despite the upward pressure on headline infl ation.  Putting the se piec es tog ether, all three m easures of core inflation shown in the bottom  panel are m ore or less flat from their current levels. Your next chart exam ines the situati on in the labor m arket.  The top panel relates the unem ploym ent gap to the GDP ga p.  By either m easure, the p ressure on productive resources will be diminishing fairly rapidly ove r the next few quarters.  The m iddle left panel shows that the more rapid top-line price in flation of  the la st two years--the gray bars--is likely to contribute to a m ore rapid rate of growth of compensation this year--the red line.  And, as shown in the m iddle right panel, we believe something sim ilar will occur with respect to productivity growth.  Com pensation dem ands appear to ref lect productivity developm ents only with a very long lag. As a result, the rapid growth of  productivity during the last few years is likely to still be  feeding through into com pensation growth at least for the remainder of the forecast period.  All told, as sho wn in the bo ttom panel, we expect compensation growth as m easured by the em ploym ent cost index to be about the same this year as last, as the effect of easing resource utilization is about of fset by the larger contribution from lagged inflation.  Next year, how ever, we expect the ECI to decelerate as th e dow nturn in energy prices dam ps the contribution  from lagged inflation by 0.4 percentage point. Karen Johns on will now continue ou r presentatio n.

MS. JOHNS ON.  Your fi rst internationa l chart reviews develop ments in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and compares interest rate and stock p rice move ments in the euro area and Japan with those  in the Unite d States.  Despite the slowing of U.S. output growth that has becom e apparent since January and the downward revisions to prospective earn ings for U.S. fir ms, the dollar has appreciated over the past six m onths agains t the e uro, the b lue line in the top lef t panel, and the yen, the red line. On balan ce, the staf f’s index  of the dolla r in term s of the other m ajor industrial country currenc ies, the black line, has risen nearly 7 percent since early January. No doubt part of  the explanation of th is strength lies in the m ore negative near-term  outlook for grow th abroad that has em erged over this same period, to which I will return s hortly.  But dollar appreciation sugg ests investors continue to see risk-adjusted return s available on U .S. investm ents as funda mentally m ore attractiv e than opportunities abroad.    6/26-27/01 60Long-term  interest rates, in the top ri ght panel, have risen on balance in the United States and Germ any since the st art of the year but have m oved down somewhat in Japan.  Three-m onth rates, th e middle left panel, are down in all three areas, but by greatly differing am ounts.  Monetary policy has been eased only slightly by the ECB, and short-term  rates in the euro area have fallen by far less than in the United States. In March, the Bank of  Japan effectively returned to its zero interest rate policy, and three-m onth m arket rates  retraced the rise that h ad occurred in mid-2000.  Current m arket expectations of policy m oves as captured by Eurocurrency futures rates are show n to the right.  In com parison with do llar rates, the euro curve, the blue line, looks for so mewhat more reduction over the rest of this year followed by a sim ilar-sized tightening ne xt year rather than a rap id return to significantly higher rates. Yen rates sugge st that m arkets see the Bank of Japan maintaining its cu rrent easy stanc e for som e time.   Stock prices are presented in the bott om two panels.  Equity prices have continued to m ove in broadly sim ilar patte rns th is year, a lthou gh high-tech stocks have generally been hit harder in the United States and Europe than in Japan. Recent trade developm ents, the sub ject of  your n ext chart, reflect the econ omic weakness abroad and at hom e.  Exports of  goods, rows 1 through 6 in the upper left panel, dec lined in nom inal te rms in the first quarter and again in April as did imports of goods, lines 9 through 15.  Declin es were pronounced in the auto sector (lines 4 and 13) in the firs t quarter.  Both im ports a nd exports of com puters and semiconductors have dropped so far this year .  In April, other item s within capital goods were also weak, especially on the import side.  The panels to the right indicate that exports have decreased to  all of the regions shown except western Europe. We continue to look for oil prices, sh own in the lower left, to move down gradually over the forecast period, in line with futures prices, as increases in non-OPEC suppl y satisfy dem and.  We a lso again expect the appreciati on of the dollar to end, as shown in the right panel, but for the dollar to rem ain strong in real term s over the forecast period. Our outlook for real GDP growth abroad is sum marized at the top of your next chart. Econom ic expansi on in the rest of the worl d clearly slowed sharply on average in the first quarter and rem ains weak  currently in m ost areas.  In assessing the prospects for a rebound in foreign activ ity over the forecast period, we had to take into account spillovers from  the projected strengthening of U.S. activity, expected developm ents in the global hi gh-tech industry, and dom estic factors, including macroeconom ic polic y responses, in key foreign econom ies.  Overall, we look for real output grow th abroad to accelerate, with averag e foreign growth reach ing ab out  3-1/2 percen t in 2 002, in  line with the reb ound projected in U.S. real output growth. We expect stronger growth next year in each of the three m ajor 6/26-27/01 61 regions, shown in the panel to the right, but  we do not expect a return to the rates observed last year. In Latin America, U.S. econom ic developm ents are especially im portant for Mexico; Argentina and Brazil are struggling with problem s particular to the region.  As you can see in the m iddle left panel, the dollar has depreciated relative to the Mexican peso this year as capital inflows to  Mexico have held firm  in the context of progress on reform s and the tight stance of  policy by the Bank of Mexico.  In contras t, the dollar has appreciated s harply r ecently in term s of the Brazilian real as domestic en ergy and political p roblems and f inancial m arket spillov ers from Argentina have weighed on that currenc y.  Brazilian m onetary policy has been tightened in response to the inflation risk s posed by the fall in the currency.  Brady bond spreads, shown to the right, reflect the recent stresses in Argentina, where spreads rose rapidly until late April. The success of the Argentine debt exchange initiative a lleviated near -term  financing conce rns, and m arkets reac ted po sitively with lower s preads.  However, the lates t policy moves in Argentina to tax im ports and subsidize exports have heightened uncer tainty again and raised questions about policies going forward. Industrial production, in the bottom  left panel, has d eclined through April this year in both Mexico and Brazil as dem and has softened.  For Mexico, the reduction in U.S. de mand for its exports and the retren chment in the first quarter of the North American auto sector have been particul arly im portan t in exp laining the d rop in industrial production. In Argentina, production h as recov ered recen tly fro m As reported to the right, we are projecti ng that recovery will  be strongest in Mexico; the projected U.S. upturn and som e easing of monetary conditions by the Bank of Mexico will provide the stimulu s for stronger growth.  In Brazil and Argentina, we have forecast som e increas e in growth.  That outlook assu mes that financial stresses will continue  but not aggreg ate to the po int of triggering a discrete break in access to funding at  acceptable term s by either country.  However, the debt profiles in both countries pose risks that co uld threaten the retu rn to higher growth. Among the Asian em erging m arket econom ies, the subject of your next chart, recen t experience has differed, depen ding in part on each eco nomy’s dependence on the high-tech sector. As can be seen in th e top lef t, the dollar ha s risen with respec t to many of t he Asian currencies over the past six months, although the Korean won has since retraced som e of its depreciati on.  As can be seen o n the right, d ollar-denom inated yield sp reads have been stable in 2 001 for Korea and the P hilippines.  In Thailand, spreads have widened recently owing to changes in m arket expectations about the direction of policy. The m iddle panel com pares an aggregate of  industrial production in five of the Asian em erging m arket econom ies to worldwide sem iconductor shipm ents, which have clearly been an im portant determ inant of industrial output  in these countries 6/26-27/01 62 since 1996. The sharp downturn in sem iconductor shipm ents in late 2000 was a common fac tor underm ining their econom ic grow th.  This is not surprising given the large weights shown in the table in the bo ttom left for the hig h-tech s ector more broadly in their industrial production indexes and the shares of high-tech goods in their total ex ports.  In lig ht of this dependence, revival of econom ic growth in these econom ies would seem  to hinge on stabiliz ation in the global high-tech sector. The staff’s projections for this region are shown in the box to the right.  Reported output growth in China has not  fallen w ith the general global slowdown, and we see steady growth over the fo recast perio d, supported  by government expenditure. In Korea, Taiwan, and Singapor e, growth dropped sharply in the first half of this year, and we look for m oderate recovery going forward.  The Korean econom y is larger and more diversified than  the others in the “high-tech” group, and its recovery m ay be somewhat less dependent  on developm ents in those industries.  The slowdown has been acute in Hong Kong, wh ere the drop in global trade resulted in sluggish activity in recent quarters. Recovery elsewhere in the region, along with lower real interest rates,  should benefit Hong Kong.  Your next chart reviews current cond itions in the industr ial countries and summarizes our outlook. Industrial produc tion, shown in the top left, has been moving down in each of the reg ions shown fr om peaks reach ed in m id- to late 2000.  The declin es for Japan are severe whereas in both  the euro area and Canad a domestic f actors have of fset to som e extent the de creas es in de mand hitting those econom ies from  abroad.  Canada is clos ely integrated with the U.S. economy, including in particular the auto and hi gh-tech sectors; but Canadian dom estic demand has proven to be som ewhat resilient so far, boosted by m onetary and fiscal easing and spending in the energy sector. In the euro area, th e global slowdown has had a visible im pact only in the m ost recent data as export g rowth has slo wed.  Business confidence, shown to the right, has shif ted down in all three regions, however, raising concerns about furthe r cutbacks in investm ent spending.   Employm ent gains in Canada and the eu ro area, the m iddle left panel, have been im portant to date in supporting growth of incom e and c onsum ption.  Consum er confidence had been fairly steady at a high level, but the latest observations suggest some erosion.  In Japan, em ploym ent has gi ven back the increases recorded in 2000.  Consum er confidence now appears to be dropping as evidence m ounts that the econom y is slipping backward again.     Our forecast, reported in the bottom  pane ls, reflects the fact that we rem ain quite pessim istic about recovery of real  GDP growth in Japan  over the forecast period. Both real GDP (line 2 on the left) and dom estic dem and (line 1 on the right) should decline further in the s econd half of this year as fi scal stim ulus runs out and private investm ent continues to drop back from  the high level reached at the end of last year. Next year, a return to some positive growth in private investm ent and weak consumption growth should result in expansion of activity.  The policy agenda just announced by the governm ent does stress some refor ms that have the potential 6/26-27/01 63 to contribute to reviving the econom y over time.  But it rem ains uncertain whether Prim e Minis ter Koizum i will be ab le to im plem ent thes e reforms aggressively and whether th ey will, in the short run, cause additio nal weakening in econo mic activity. Our forecast assum es no dram atic effect from  the reform s in either d irectio n through next year. In the euro area we look for the decline in oil prices and for fiscal stim ulus already in place to suppo rt househo ld incom e and spending later th is year and next.  Our forecast for Canada depends m ore directly o n the reboun d in the U.S. econom y and im provem ent in the high-tech sector, but nevertheless is largely driven by the projected strength in dom estic dem and.  The external sector of the U.S. economy is the subject of your final international chart. The deep drop in core export growth, the red bars at the top left, can be explained in contribution term s by the slump in global econom ic activity (represented by the sum  of the blue and yellow bars) and by the strength in the dollar (reflected in the green bars).  We expect recovery  in activity abroad to boost export grow th som ewhat next year.  Core import growth, the red bars in the m iddle panel, is expected to be even less this y ear than what would be im plied by low U.S. GDP growth (in blue) plus relative price effects (the green bars).  This outlook reflects im port growth to da te this year, which h as been  negative, whereas U.S. GDP growth has rem ained positiv e.  Imports of capital goods have been especially weak.  The turnaround in U.S. real GDP should boost growth of core im ports next year to about 6 percent. The contribution of export grow th to GDP, shown on the right, should return to being p ositive in th e second half of this year and increas e som ewhat next year. We expect the contribution of i mports to re turn to being negative and also to becom e greater in magnitude next year, by m ore than that of exports. Growth of total real exports, line 1 of the m iddle left panel, is projected to be sharply reduced this year and to rise next ye ar by m ore than that  of core goods (line 4) as exports of se miconductors and com puters rebound.  Similarly, growth of total real im ports (line 1 to the right) is projected to rebound strongly next year. The slowdown in U.S. activity has resulted in a pause in the deterioration of the U.S. current account balance, shown in the bottom left.  With stronger U.S. growth next year, the current account balance s hould return to its downward trend.  A snapshot of U.S. capital flows is presented in the right panel.  Purchases by private foreign investors of U.S. securities other than Treasuries continue to be extremely high. Foreign direct investment in U.S. assets diminished noticeably in the first quarter, and U.S. direct inve stment abroad also fell. Dave Stockton will now com plete our presen tation. 

[SECTION]

MR.STOCKTON. The final chart disp lays your projections f or 2001 and 2002.  The central tendency of your projections for the growth of real GDP in 2001 has 6/26-27/01 64 been revised down from the fo recasts made at the time of the February meeting.  At the same time, the central tendency of your  PCE inflation projections has edged up. For 2002, growth of real GDP is expect ed to pick up, while inflation is projected to run close to the pace expected for this year. Mr. Chairman, that completes our presentation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you very mu ch.  What I found most interesting in the presentation was the very in formative evaluation of the cap ital overhang, a subject on which a detailed report was sent around to the Committee.   Specifically, I thought the elaboration of the situation in the telecommunications industry was really most useful.  In that regard, as I recall that report gave a number that indicated that the volume of network type markets doubles every year. What is the source of that number?  And what is its definition? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  If I’m recalli ng correctly, I think that wa s from a conversation we had with one of our business contacts. I believe it wa s in the context of one of the CEOs remarking that previously he or she had thought that demand would double every three months and now catastrophe had befallen them and it only doubles once a year. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, as I reme mber, the quote was that it had been doubling every year but was going to  start to double every three or  four months.  Then whoever wrote that part of the paper said that indeed it  had not changed; it was just doubling every year.  Now, the implication is that that means somethi ng.  If only I knew what it was! It’s obviously referring to some digital flow measure and I’ve  seen the quote before. Moore’s law I understand because that can actually be documented.  But what are people talking about here? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Maybe somebody can help me by finding the reference. 6/26-27/01 65

[SECTION]

SPEAKER( ?).  Whenever they h ave a contract that pays them to do it! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, okay. [Laughter]  Incidentally, on Chart 14, one is obviously struck by the m iddle panel in that As ian sem iconductor produc tion appears to track world shipments data--I m ean allo wing for playing around with scale. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Yes, the scale is m aking that relationship look good. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Yes, but I'm  just curious about that big breakaway at the end of the most recent period. Is that a price or market share issu e or just plain statistical noise? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. To be honest, I don't know. Let me just make sure that what we’ve plotted there is understood; it' s the whole indus trial production index of the Asian sem iconductor producer countries that is being averaged. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It's a physical volum e index. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Right, but it’s of their to tal industrial produc tion not just their semiconductor production. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH .  Total production. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The c hart says Asian sem iconductor producers.   

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. The IP of Asian countries  that produce sem iconductors is how you should read that.  6/26-27/01 66

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  That identi fies the countries and it is the average IP for those cou ntries. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Okay, sorry abou t that.  The chart could benefit from some improvem ent in the labeling, if  I may say so.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  Mr. Chairm an, I too thought the capital overhang paper was a very good paper. I was particularly im pressed with the fact that the staff did the econom etric analysis and then went out and spoke to people in th e industry, and essentially those conversations verified the findings in the econom etric analysis. 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  I won’t m ake any co mments on our standard errors! 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  Well, I was wondering if you had any thoughts as to w hether the financial m arkets actually are reflecting this overhang now, and whether you can relate that in any way to one of the alternative simulations in the Greenb ook--the “ea rnings disappointm ent” one. Is this already built into m arket prices o r is this an ind ication that we’re going to see a big earnings disappointm ent rela ting to that sim ulation? 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  I think it' s hard to know.  It certainly is the c ase tha t the telecom sector has been punished incredibly. Stock prices  of the telecom  service f irms and the equipm ent makers have been beaten down by just astonish ing proportions.  Whether they' ve taken on board the full extent of the outlook as we see it, I can' t say, though by and large the raw m aterials of the analysis we've done are in the public  sector.  In this particular re gard I don' t think we have any information that is not a vailab le to a  caref ul market analyst.  That doesn' t insure that it’s reflected in the cu rrent leve l of prices by any m eans. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. It's hard to know exactly how closely co nnected it is to the capital overhang per se. Obviously, what we are trying to communicate in that p articula r simulation is 6/26-27/01 67 that we do see som e possibility of considerab le tension in our outl ook for profits, which is weaker than m arket analysts are currently reporting.  Now, that coul d be resolved in a num ber of ways. One, earnings could turn out to be weaker than the analysts think. Maybe that is already discounted in the m arkets, which is part of what  you are asking.  Two, investors in essence could be m ore patient in this period of weak earnings if they really f oresaw a snapback in activity, even if it's going to be a bit delayed.  Three, as in  the sim ulation that we presented in the Greenbook, there could be som e considerab le downside risk to stock prices goi ng forward.  Or four, as in the simulation that we presented in the Bluebook, we could be w rong about productivity; m aybe developm ents on the p roductiv ity front will turn  out to be be tter than we are cu rrently anticipating and we’ll get a bit better earnings growth than is envisioned in the Greenbook forecast. So, I think there is a wide range of  possibilities here, but we do see som e tension curren tly in the financial settings  relative to our econom ic for ecast. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. David, on Chart 5 labeled “F iscal Policy,” in the lower right-hand corner the unified budget surplus for fisc al year 2001--for this fiscal year, w hich is three-fourths over--is shown as $185 billion.  I recall seeing the other day that the Treasury reported a s urplus for th e month of April alone of  $190 billion.  Am I right that from this point forward, the com bination of the spending growth that you and others have assum ed--the rebates and the lower withhold ings--means that outlays will exceed receipts fo r the balance o f the calendar year? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I'm not sure exactly. You' re citing, I suppose, the m onthly Treasury statem ent figures.  And if  those figures are right, that’s exactly what our forecast would  6/26-27/01 68 be anticipating. We have also heard from  the Treasury that recei pts are com ing in wea ker than had been expected, and we’ve tried to factor th at in.  But there could be som e downside risks even to th e receip ts forecast going forward as well.   

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Yes, but from  that standpoint --abstracting from  the fiscal year and the full calendar year issue--your interpretation would be that at least for the n ear term  there is going to be less fis cal drag and  more fiscal stim ulus for the balance of the calendar year? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Probably yes, though I'm not quite sure.  To gauge the overall effects on the econom y one would want  to look at the m onthly flow of spending and receipts.  So I would be more comfortable lookin g at a m ore aggregated level.  Another factor that is affecting the pattern of these figures som ewhat is a shifting of corporate tax receipts out of the end of this fiscal year into next fiscal year. That was a part  of the budget deal in the tax cut proposal in order to give som e room  to do a little m ore spending in  fiscal 2002.  The basic point we want to m ake is that in recent Greenbooks we have been argu ing that there were perh aps m ore upside risks on the fisca l policy s ide th an we had built into the forecas t beca use we could see thes e unused, on-budget surpluses out there. And by our current estim ates the tail of  the distribution in term s of risks for stimulative fiscal policy going fo rward has been considerably shortened. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I would say th at the unified budget surplu s forecasts in the Greenbook suggest that on a not seasonally adju sted basis the third quarter is about in balance and the fourth quarter is a slight surplus. But the se asonal pa ttern this ye ar isn’t sign ificantly dif ferent from other years, aside from  the $38 billion outflow.  Last year, almost the entire surplus occurred in the second quarter, of course, because that' s when the personal tax receipts come in.  So, the basic pattern isn' t that different this year, aside from  the $38 billion going out in rebates in the third quarter. 6/26-27/01 69

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Part of the reason I' m aski ng is because the huge tax pay ments that were m ade in April by businesses and househol ds, which were com ing out of the private econom y and into the governm ent side of the ec onom y, are behind us now.  From  this point forward, at least for the calendar year , we don' t have that flow i mpact. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Incidentally, do we have a fiscal 2003 unified budget estim ate con sisten t with the current data we have here? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. We don' t yet because we ha ve not yet extended our forecast ou t to 2003, but we will be do ing that in th e next few months. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Thank you. This is just a clarifying question on Chart 8, the m iddle panel. In your discussion you suggested, I think,  that the spark that created the m ovem ent down in investm ent started with telecommunications and then m oved over to real E&S spending other than high-tech. Did I hear you correctly when y ou were referring to the relationship of the high-tech se ctor to the dec line in other investm ent spending? 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  What I was trying to do was to lay out som e theory on the tim ing, or the sequence in which these events m ight have unfolded. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. I ask because activity in  the m anufacturing sector was probably just having a hard tim e following your theory ex actly in terms of this  downturn and I wonder whether there are any imp lications if I disagree w ith you on that --if I don' t think the tech sector had m uch to do with this perhaps. 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  I would hate to go to the m at on that issue without having a chance to look at the data first. My sense is that the gist of  this channel,  as shown in the m iddle chart, is 6/26-27/01 70 that by and large a so rt of traditional accelerator  mechanism  seem s to have operated here.  One elem ent that is unusual, though, is that m any people perceive the originating shock to have been one to business investm ent.  And at least a com ponent of that shock seems to have com e from  the telecom  service sector.  Those firm s them selves acc ount for what is, at least to m e, an astonishing fraction of overall investm ent.  I don't have th e figure nailed down but it’s som ewher e between 10 and 15 percent of overall equipm ent investm ent.  So clearly, the reasse ssment of the prospects for the telecom  service sector wa s important, but that' s not to s uggest that developm ents in the industrial sector were not also an important contributing factor. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. There is no doubt that m any m anufacturing firm s also have been under intense pressure from  com petition abroad, given the strength of  the dollar.  We saw that by the declines in a variety of areas  outside of the tech area as well.  We do think that was also an important elem ent in prom ulgating this weakness. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. I just w anted to m ake sure I heard it right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Back on the tax cut issu e: You m ake an assum ption--righ tly, I think-- about how m uch of the sp ending is going to com e out of inventories.  But I don' t see anyone suggesting that any of the spending is going to be used for im ports, which in a mathematical sense would be a drag on GDP.  How should we think about that?  Is that such a small num ber that we shouldn’t worry  about it at all? Or has it just not been talked about m uch and we probably should think about it? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Well, we’ve looked at the num bers a bit.  We don 't have any analysis that would e nable us to s ay that these  tax reb ates will be sp ent dif ferently than other co nsum ption dollars are spent. But we did look at the historic al track of imports as a percent of consum ption 6/26-27/01 71 and it has been rising. It's not possib le to calc ulate it p recisely  because the way the imports are reported there are capital goods, there are consum er goods, and autos is a separate category.  Autos generally are som e of each, so who knows ? Putting imports of goods in the num erator and consum ption of goods in the denominator produces  a ratio of 10, 11, 12 percent or som ething like that and it has been rising over tim e.  That is one  step in the direction of  answering the question.  That' s excluding the autos com pletely, I think, and it would be a litt le more if one tried to m ake some allowance for that by putting in som e autos. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  I, too, thought the capit al overhang paper was very good.  Among other things, it m oved my knowledge of fiber optics fr om 0 to 1 percent, a big increase!  But as I look at Chart 7, I’m  troubled by something.  As best I can tell from  drawing lines, the capital overhang began to open up about 18 months ago, ri ght around the start of year 2000.  And if one looks closely, it' s really not clos ing at this point, 18 m onths la ter.  In the Greenbook baseline projection, it appears to m e that equipm ent and software is slack th rough the fourth quarter of this year and then starts rising at fa irly healthy rates.  So, we’ve got  this overhang that has developed and has been with us for a year and a half , and we know the econom y is quite weak.  The question is: What is it that turns this around and gets inve stment growing at seem ingly reasonab le rates in ju st six m onths? 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  Well, there are a co uple of el ements th at I can th row out.  One is, as we tried to e mphasize in the repo rt, that these gaps that open up between the estim ated target and the actual capital exert som e drag on aggregate demand.  And at least if you believe the m odel estim ates--though I could give you a long list of r easons why you shouldn’t--these gaps are rather slow to work off. So, for exam ple, in the hi gh-tech graph on that char t we can see that through 6/26-27/01 72 most of the 1980s there was an alle ged gap that didn' t get corrected.  That' s just to say that the overhang in high-tech equipm ent and in other eq uipm ent is a moderate negative on the outlook.  But that in a nd of  itself  doesn't have a larg e increm ental effec t.  In his rem arks I believe Dave Stockton highlighted the two key factors that we think are going to turn the econom y around.  One is m onetary policy and the other is fiscal polic y.  All th is sort of  rolls togethe r; if it becom es apparen t that the m omentum  of the econom y is s hifting, then  through norm al accelerator effects other things start to com e along w ith it.  But the two key prime m overs would be fiscal policy and monetary policy. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. May I jum p in?  I think on e of the other points that has been m ade in this area--you' ve m ade it befo re but you didn’t m ake it this tim e--is that this type of capital tends to depreciate relatively quick ly com pared to som e other types.   I assum e that' s part of your thinking as you consider how this gap m ight start to close.  Is that a fair point? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  Yes, but that' s really only true on the left side, the high-tech side.  And there is a big gap in the ot her than high-tech E&S spending. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Right. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  So your story is that the gap m ay be with us for a while, but that doesn' t mean that investm ent won' t be recovering?   That' s basically it. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Yes, you can see it in the up per right panel of David’s chart.  If those estim ates are to be believed, we have had a gap for a decade.  We had growth of investm ent over that period as well. It's always tem pting, when we' re in a period of extrem ely slow growth or even a do wnturn in ac tivity, to wo nder how we will ev er get back to p ositive grow th again.  As David m entioned we see policy, both m onetary a nd fiscal, supporting that.  We also see support from  just the sim ple inventory dynam ics that we are going through right now where production is 6/26-27/01 73 well below sales and we have i nventory liquidations.  When that process ends, we do get a pickup in employm ent and incom es and that begins to feed sales and sales expectations.  So we don't think it' s unreasonable to exp ect that by the m iddle of ne xt year we' ll be returning to m ore robust growth in investment spending. But in ke eping with Governor Ferguson’s edict, we would readily adm it that there is e norm ous uncertainty about that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  May I just ask a question abou t the regression analysis used in creating your target?   In the upper right-hand panel, the target is a calculated num ber coming off a  regres sion, I presum e, fitted to the actual d ata? 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  Fitted to the ac tual data and estimated in a system  of four equations involving these two elem ents of equipm ent pl us nonresidential struct ures as a third and inventories as a fourth. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If you take th e trend out, which gives you a nice fat correlation, it looks pretty awful to me. How can  you be confident that what you have is truly excess?   If you were dealing with rates of re turn or som ething like that, perhaps you could somehow demonstrate th at the rates o f return are falling--that you' re gettin g less return  per unit of capital. Do you feel comfortable w ith this sort of relationship?  Does it tell you all that m uch? 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  I could never plead  guilty to  feeling com fortable with so mething as far rem oved from  what ordinary bu siness decisio n makers see as thei r reality.  If I were to try to defend this as best I could, I’d say th at one piece of corroborating ev idence is th at if we look at average periods over which there has been an ove rhang--d efined by the sh aded gray areas--they correspond to periods of slower than average gr owth.  And by contrast, the periods w hen the actual stock was short of the targ et stock are ones with faster gr owth.  Now all kinds of things were going on during those periods; the overhang wasn' t the only factor by any m eans.  But that' s 6/26-27/01 74 one piece of  corroborating evidence.   And then, consistent w ith Presiden t Moskow' s comment, it does m ake m e feel a little better  that when we went out and talk ed with som e real people--   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That I can understand. 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  I guess I m anaged to take som e comfort in that, m aybe more frankly than from  these m odel estim ates. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is there any way you can back out the excess? Essentially, what we m ean by overha ng is cap ital that is no t yield ing its r ate of return in the way President Poole was raising the question. Since we  do have profits data by  industry and we have capital by industry, isn’t there a way to infer whether or not the capital  is short?  In other words, if capita l is short, one would expect the rate of return to be above norm al and vice versa.  Wouldn' t that give you a m ore sensitive judgm ent as to where the ov erhangs are? 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  I don' t think I can answer that on the spot, but I' ll certainly think about that. It's an interesting question. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The r eason I raise the issue of looking at it in term s of individual industries, rather than on a m acro basis, is that th ere are five or six m ajor sectors of the econom y for which we do have profit m argins and, I would think, effective data on capital stock.  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. I have a detail question on Chart 12.  Karen, in those panels on the right, exports for W estern Europe ar e bucking the trend.  Why is that? 

[SECTION]

MS JOHNS ON.  Well, it is the case that for longer than any othe r region of the global econom y Western Europe believed itself to be prot ected, in a sense, from  som e of the negative consequences of what was going on.  In part that was because--the y would alleg e--the region is a largely self-contained and rela tively closed econom y and doe s not have a big high-tech­6/26-27/01 75 producing sector. That had been in som e sense a shortcom ing during the boom  years of the late '90s, but suddenly it becam e a benefit.  Othe r than  Nokia and Ericsson, an d I suppose Philips, they don' t have any m ajor technology firm s.  In any event, they are certainly less into high-tech than the United States. So they didn' t have clear sectors with large employm ent that were going to lead the charge down. In all honesty, if you look on Chart 15, you' ll see that dom estic dem and in the eu ro area was actu ally rather weak in Q1, but their exports to other parts of the w orld held up and kept up their GDP. Obviousl y, since that figure is for H1, it inco rporates our view on Q2, but you can see that GDP is m uch stronger than domestic dem and in the earlier period on our calculation. That was certainly tr ue in Q1.  So their exports held up and they bought from  us.  And for a long tim e they asserted that their GDP was at about potential in  a level sense--growing at what th ey thought was an accep table rate of a robust 2 percent, and th ey felt they w ere in good shape. Now, exports fell off a fter Q1 and the m ost recent numbers have been weak.  But this is sort of a new development from  their point of view, and I would assum e, therefore, that their import de mand for our products will turn out to have weakened in Q2.  But through Q1 the picture was different.

MS. JOHNS ON.  There's  a cadre of people with in Japan who are arguing that there is a sequencing issue--recovery and reform or reform  and recovery.  There are reasonable people--and I consider Krugm an and Sachs on som e days to be reasonable--on the side th at says recovery and then reform .  The problem with that argum ent, of c ourse, is that to som e extent that is the his tory of the past 12 years, and look where it has gotten them . 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  The other problem  with the argum ent is that it’s wrong. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Well, it has b een tried for 12 years and nothing has happened! 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON.  It hasn't worked yet anyway, but the 13th year m ight be the charm ! 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Do they just fritter aw ay their ammunition by doing things on too small a scale for a long period of tim e? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON.  Well, there’s som e possibility of that.  The other concern is that it doesn' t necessarily answ er your question about whet her the patient can tolera te the medicine.  It does not m ean that if they aggressively undertake re form  that the patient won' t die, in the sense of having som e significant negative and socially disruptive sequence of econom ic events beset them .  At this point it' s almost an article of fa ith between these two cam ps as to what' s important.  Caught in the m iddle, of course, is  the Bank of Japan; it m ay have one last arrow in its quiver and it’s called “quantitative easing,” wh ich means different things to di fferent people.  BOJ officials are waiting to shoot that arrow at  the point when they think it is most needed and will do the m ost good. So they are saying do the reform s and if the pa tient starts to get sicker  before he starts to 6/26-27/01 77 get well, we will step in and do what we can. Others are say ing no, use th is device no w to get the econom y stronger so it can withstand the physical th erapy a little better.  Again, I think it' s very hard to be certain, ex ante, which of those argum ents is better founded.  But the history of the last 12 years suggests that norm al recovery steps aren' t going to buy them  anything.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Thank you. Let m e return for just a m inute to the projection for restored growth next year. It's pretty clea r that the impetus f or that is go ing to com e from fiscal and m onetary policy and m aybe the cessation of th is inventory cycle.  You have essentially a trend growth projection for next year of around 3.5 percent growth.  Where is this going to manifest itself in the various sectors of the econo my?  What do you see leading us back out here?  Are capital expenditures going to co me back and be a lead er again ?  Are we going to see ren ewed growth in housing and autom obiles? What sectors are going lead the retu rn? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. In some sense, Governor Kelley, as we showed in the charts, we do think that in the near-term  fiscal policy is going to be prov iding a boost to an already weak econom y. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Right. That' s where the impetus com es from but where does it mani fest itself? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. As we m ove through the se cond half of the year, we are looking for som e impetus on the consum er spending si de and through the eventual cessation of the invento ry correction.  We think m onetary po licy will be p roviding som e support as we go through the year and into next year  in helping to m aintain the r easonably high level of auto sales and housing starts we have had. Also we expect  monetary policy to be providing an environm ent in which businesses can pum p up th eir balance sheets and then be pr epared to take advantage of 6/26-27/01 78 the opportunities on the investm ent side that we think are goi ng to be there from  the trend productivity we’re projecting. So when that und erbrush gets cleared aw ay, there will be an environm ent in which both consum er spending an d business investm ent are back, in term s of providing important support to growth. For th e near term  it’s consum ption though; we don’t really see m uch in cap ital spending u ntil next yea r. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLY. Well, next year will be fairly  balanced then, if I'm hearing you correctly in term s of where the grow th is going to show up. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOC KTON.  Next year will be fairly  balanced.  We are still getting som e depressing effect on consum ption fr om the wealth effect.  It's not pushing growth further down, but it is a factor keeping the gr owth of consum ption running belo w the growth of incom e.  But yes, by the m iddle of ne xt year we think growth  will look m ore balanced than it does currently.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good m orning, everyone.  We are now at the point on our agenda where the Committee’s d iscussion of the econom y begins and I' m looking for volunteers.  Presiden t Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. Now that I have volunteered, all I have to do is find my papers! [Laughter] Sorry, I wasn' t quite prepar ed.  I would like to comment first by providing some general im pressions about econom ic activit y in the District.  As one of our Business Advisory Council m embers said, we are “bum ping along the bottom .”  Activity is not continuing to decline but it is not reboundi ng.  And except for the steel i ndustry, I think that generally summarizes what directors and Advisory Council m embers think about the situation in our region. We had reports from  a corrugated box com pany and separately from  a freight delivery company that are both headquartered in the Distri ct of a rebound in the s econd quarter after steep indicator there is, but the Chairm an should know be tter than I whether that’s  true.  A supplier of siding, decking, window m aterials, and PVC pipe--a nd this is a com pany that m anufactures and sells nationwide as well as a bit internationally- -reported that they had experien ced a very recent pickup in o rders.  Accordingly, th ey are hopeful that  the seco nd half will be better th an the firs t half. A manufacturer of tapes and glue said that dem and for industrial uses of their products continued to decline but consum er business was flat or up sligh tly.  A contact from  a com pany that supplies m aterials for m otor vehicle parts said that dem and from  the U.S. Big Three was down while dem and from transplants and from  plants  in Mexico was up.  He also noted that their business in Europe was weaker in the second qu arter than it had been in the first quarter. 6/26-27/01 80Reports from i mportant industries in Kentuc ky were m ixed, and som e were especially interesting. First, the state' s budget is being bailed out in a sense by strong coal severance tax revenue. The com plaint in tha t area is still the l ack of coal m iners, but ot her than that business is terrific. Second, it is estim ated that 25 percent of this year' s crop of thoroughbred colts died or were born dead. Those deaths had som ething to do with cherry blossom s and spring and caterpillars, and it' s a long story.  Industry observ ers estimate that  over the next three years that will cos t Kentucky tho roughbred farm s a half billi on dollars.  Now that th e cause is kn own, they think th is year’s exp erience will no t be repeate d.  But of course nothi ng can be done about the losses that have occurred already. As for retail com panies, Federated is h eadquartered in our District and we have grocery companies and other retailers as well. Federated reports--and this relates to its stores nationwide r ather than ju st in our  District--that apparel s ales were down sharply and are expected to continue to declin e until the f irst part of next  year.  But Kr oger’s s ays that groc ery store s ales are at reco rd levels and they are conf ident of su stained growth.  In fact , a director from a dry goods com pany said that the only explanation he could com e up with is that people must be buying food in stores and cooking it at hom e.  He cited that as a sign of  how bad things are. A major landscaping company, Scott’s, said that its spring sales were the weakest in years. Layoffs continue to be announced in manufacturing but we have had som e reports of continued labor shortages in other sectors.  A large regional bank noted that it has about 500 jobs open com pany-wide and that it is especially dif ficult to h ire for its u rban a rea loca tions.   Som e hospital health-care organizations report opening s in as m any as 40 percent of their staff position s, including the housekeepin g staff.  A company that operates nationally and em ploys 6,000 workers in the tree-surgery and m aintenance business reported that worker turnover is still 6/26-27/01 81 very high; it som etimes runs as m uch as 40 percen t.  They continue to us e recruitm ent, retention, and relo cation bonuses in their efforts to fill op enings.  Our contact said that  all segm ents of their business in all regions are strong except fo r the C alifornia power com panies, which are delinquent and refuse to pay their bills. It con tinues to be hard to recr uit and retain long-haul truck drivers. High fuel costs had been affecti ng those com panies but a co ntact at one firm  at least said th at they we re now getting  som e relie f on earnings because fuel costs have c ome down a bit. Let m e turn to the national situation.  It seems to m e that at a tim e when the problem s of som e industries and sectors ar e so clearly due to excess supply--structura l kinds of problem s, whether do mestic or f oreign-- there is a risk th at adding abun dant liquidity will cau se overhea ting in those areas such as housing th at continue to be strong.  But that liquidity is not going to provide any relief to other trouble d sectors.  Neither the price nor the av ailability of  credit is a problem  for the sm aller c ompanies, f or the truck manufacturers or teleco mmunications firm s, the furniture or textile com panies in  Al Broaddus’s District , or the personal com puter and electronics firms in Texas or elsewhere.  The ex cess retail sp ace is no t going to be qu ickly absorb ed as a consequence of increased m onetary stim ulus.  And adding further to the already am ple liquidity in the financial system  is not going to  cause apparel sales to rebound suddenly.  We seem  to have three sources of stimulus in the works right now.  We have m onetary stimulus and fiscal stim ulus.  Moreover, after tw o years of higher energy prices, those prices are now declining and, from what I hear, they m ay dec line even m ore than the staff fore cast suggests.  Certainly, som e adverse effects on households and various industries, sect ors, and regions--not only in our country but around the world--occurred when energy pr ices were high, m ost notably in our own PRC, the People' s Republic of Calif ornia.  [Lau ghter]  But the effects were not all 6/26-27/01 82 adverse eith er for the U nited States or elsewhere.   The increase in energy prices did ef fectively communicate the need f or greater energy supply as well as the value of innovation in energy conservation. It is gratifying to see that we have had a significant in crease in energy production, and a lot m ore will be com ing on stream  over the ne xt year or so, especia lly electric capacity.  Also, som e truly rem arkable efficien cies in  energy consum ption are being achieved by commercial enterprises, thanks to better m anagement.  So we are now in a period of falling energy prices, in large part a re flection of the substantially gr eater aggregate supply of energy, not declining dem and.  And that is going to increase both our inco me and our output.  We have monetary stimulus, of course; I don't need to say anything m ore about that. And finally, we have fiscal stim ulus. American businesses and households are going to get four “postcards” over the next nine m onths to give them an idea of how perm anent the tax reduction is.  Starting next week, they will see a reduction in withhold ing.  Quantitatively it m ay not be larg e, bu t it is a m essage.  Sometime in the next two or thre e months they w ill get a ch eck in the m ail.  Whether it' s large or not, it will be a m essage.  On January 1st of next year they will  see a further withholding reduction, and then next April th ey will either p ay sm aller taxe s or get a bigger refund than previously. So in nine months’ ti me people will get four m essages that their taxes, s tate as well as Federal, are going down. Over the prior m onths , the first four or five months of this year, American p eople sen t a lot of checks  to their gov ernm ent--many of them  large checks . A lot of those tax paym ents were on earnings  realized in the year 2000, and people m ay not even have the money anymore. In som e cases, they probably had to borrow to pay their taxes.  So over the first four m onths of this year, as m y question yest erday was trying to im ply, households as w ell as businesses were feeling the pinch of  having to sh ift a great d eal of cash to Uncle Sam and their 6/26-27/01 83 state and local governm ents.  That period is now over for this calendar year.  From  this point on, basically we are going to have fi scal stim ulus in the pipeline, augm ented by m onetary stim ulus and falling energy prices. We'd better be careful.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  While our Southeast econom y is still showing m odest growth, it has slowed further sin ce our last m eeting.  We continue to look for some first signs of a rebound, but have not seen  them  yet.  The econom ist who led off the regional part of m y briefing for this m eeting st arted his presentation with the rem ark: “It looks like a bummer of a summ er.”  Retailers seem  to have grown more weary with the now sluggish pace of sales .  While sales are gen erally in line with lowered exp ectations, retailers are pessim istic about the m onths ahead.  For the fi rst tim e since the disappoi nting Christm as season, many are expressing concern abou t inventories being above desi rable levels.  Manufacturing continues to contract, with w eakness now showing up in apparel,  textiles, alum inum , steel, petrochem icals, trucks, and luxury boats.  On the other hand, despite our  general concern about the pace of investm ent spending, co mpanies in our growing southern au to industry, in cluding Nissan, Toyota, Honda, and Saturn, are pro ceeding with m ajor new investm ents and expansions.  Should over-investm ent result or auto sales falter, our expectati on is that cutbacks would not be at these new , more efficient facilities  but rather  would be borne by older plants in other parts of the country. Reports hav e also been a little les s positive on th e outlook fo r tourism , one secto r that has been on my list of positiv es until now.  While bookings are sligh tly below year-ag o levels, the strong d ollar and hig her fuel prices are bo th seen as cu tting into bus iness.  And th e fires in 6/26-27/01 84 Florida are k eeping som e people away.  Excess capaci ty is also contributing to tourism ’s woes, a s a host of large new cruise ships and luxury hotel s are com ing on line at just the wrong tim e.   Trade in our region depends, more than in other parts of the c ountry, on a healthy and growing Latin America.  Karen Johnson has already touched on some of the negatives in that part of the world, but I would like to underscore the ob servation that developments in the important economies of Argentina and Brazil do not bode well for the short-term outlook in South America.  Argentine authorities have de facto begun to devalue the peso and have abandoned their dollar peg under the guise of an export s ubsidy.  In my view, that is un likely to spur economic growth and may well be the precursor to increased financ ial instability in the region.  In Brazil, the emergence of electric power crises virtually halv ed the outlook for real economic growth in the short term, and further foreign investment in the region may be threatened.  The two largest economies are not the only trouble spots in Latin America, and the deteriorating overall outlook in that region only adds to the potential fo r a drag on both our Southeast economy and on the U.S. economy more broadly. One other negative developm ent is the deteri orating fiscal outlook for several of our Southeastern states. Revenue collections are down in Alabam a, Louisiana, Florida, and Tennessee, and spending has already been cut. The bright spots in our region rem ain the sa me.  In addition to autos, which I have already m entioned, construction is holding up am azingly well.  Residential building is about flat on a year-over-year basis but still at a very high level.  Commercial construction continues at a respectable pace but we are now seeing som e slack develop, as larg e blocks of office space com e back on the m arket for subleasing and developers becom e more ca utious.  While m ore slack is appearing in  our labor m arkets, em ploym ent gro wth at l-1/2 percen t continues to ou tpace that of 6/26-27/01 85 the nation by a considerable m argin.  Loan activit y has slackened, and that is only partly due to tighter lending standards. Funds for qualified bo rrowers continue to be  available but credit quality concerns rem ain.  Indeed, inf ormation from Visa--passed on by one of our directors who manages a large credit counseling business--indicates  that they have raised  their estim ate of the increase in bankruptcies this year from 12 percent to 26 percent if the bankruptcy reform legislation passes and to 20 percen t if it does not.  Having highli ghted those concerns over credit quality, I would observe that our bank exam iners are still expressing confidence in our banks’ ability to d eal with the p resent level of stress.  Finally, the po ckets of  sign ificant p rice incre ases remain mostly the s ame--health-c are insuranc e, asphalt, and trucking rates.  Lum ber prices have joined that list f or som e specia l reasons. At the national level, my sense of where we are and what is likely ahead is not appreciably different from the Greenbook' s.  The econom y continues to stum ble along, with little evidence that the 250 basis points of policy easing that we' ve done this year is yet having m uch noticeable effect on key sectors of the econom y.  Although I continue to say both privately and publicly that I do expect to see m ore encourag ing developm ents by year-end, it' s hard at this point to see where a quick shot of broad new m omentum  is going to com e from .  Our patience is about to be tested. I share the view that m ajor new investm ent spending does not seem i mminent and that it' s not just high-tech firm s that are be ing cautious.  The chief financial officer of UPS, whose corporate headquarters are in Atlanta, told us earlier this week that they are holding off on the purchase of new trucks and airplanes until bus iness resumes.  The story we hear over and over aga in is that it' s not lower in terest rates bu t rather incr eased sales tha t will trigge r a new round of investm ent spending.  Consum er spending other than for houses and autos is now m ore subdued, and the underlying fundament als other than the expected stimulus from  the tax cut do 6/26-27/01 86 not suggest to m e that basic spen ding is likely to pick up over th e near term.  The deteriorating employm ent outlook pushes in the other direction.   With corporate earnings and stock prices languishing, there' s no wealth kicker at work.  And we are not going to get any push from  exports or from  state and local sp ending over the near term. So where do I think this leaves us?   As I suggested earlier, I believe we are at a point where we need to grit our teeth, m uster up som e patience, have som e faith in our forecast, and help others to do the sam e as well.  While we ar e alm ost certain to get mo re disappointing data in the m onths immediately ahead, it is also clear  that the adju stments from  the excess es that developed earlier are well under way. Furtherm ore, our aggressive m onetary policy easing, with its lags, and the fortunate tim ing of the tax law ch anges can reasonably be e xpected to kick in at about the tim e the econom y gets back on track for its own fundam ental reasons.  We’ll have our policy discu ssion in a few m inutes, but I have a few broad lead-up thoughts on that. It's my sense that most Fed watchers h ave com e to believe that we will continue eas ing, perhaps  in big 50 basis poin ts steps, until we see concre te evidence th at the econom y has turned around and has new upward m omentum .  That is not wh at I think we intend or want to do. My sense is that it is not still lower in terest rates that will cure th e rem aining ills, but rather som e funda mental adjustm ents that others in the econo my need to m ake and in fact are making.  While I recognize that not  everyone is a believer at this  point in the growing risks of inflation in the outlook, I have to giv e som e weight to those forecasts, in cluding m y own Bank’s modeling work, that suggest it is tim e to give th ose risks m ore weight.  Piling on still more easing is very likely to m ake our job even more difficu lt when we need to reverse policy.  Substantial downside risks rem ain.  One m ore sm aller easin g move now so as not to disrupt m arket 6/26-27/01 87 expectations at such a fragile point, along with a clear “all don e” m essage and a rem inder of the lagged policy effects, m ight be our best contri bution at this point.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

MR. MOSKOW .  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Econom ic activity in the S eventh District is much the sam e as I reported las t time--sluggish.  Most indus try contacts in  traditional manufacturing characterize th eir in dustries as bumping along the bottom , similar to w hat Jer ry Jordan said about his District. There is a little difference from the situation he described in that some of our contacts report that  conditions are still ge tting worse.  Reports from  high-tech firm s were uniform ly dis mal.  At our last m eeting, I noted that an in creasing num ber of firm s were delaying investm ent expenditures, and that trend has continued.  Some firm s are sim ply refusing to buy any more com puter equ ipment until cond itions im prove. On a m ore positiv e note,  the la test Chicago Purc hasing Man agers’ Repo rt, to b e released this Friday, shows the com posite index moving up from  38.7 in May to 44.4 in June.  That' s its highest level f or the year.  All com ponents ind icated less weakn ess in June e xcept f or inventories, where a sharper decline probably should be reviewed as good news.  The report generally suggested both better prospects for growth and lowe r inflationary pressures.  This inform ation, of course, should be ke pt confidential until Friday m orning. We held our eighth annual Auto Outlook Sym posium in Detroit earl ier this month.  It drew over 100 participants.  Like the Greenbook, the consensus of 30 forecasts submitted by that group was that light vehicle sales would be about  16.3 million this year.  Those forecasters were more optimistic than the Greenbook for next year, however, in that they saw a slight increase to 16.4 million units versus the Greenbook forecast of 15.7 million.  We also had some reports that the steel industry may be nearing bottom. Meanwhile, consumer spending and housing activity 6/26-27/01 88 still are holding up reasonably well in our District.  As is often the cas e, reports f rom retailers have been mixed, with w eather being an im porta nt factor influencing sales of apparel and seasonal ite ms.  Furnitu re sales have been weak, while sales of  other hom e-related item s were still said to be relatively str ong.  Jewelry sales have softened slightly but have not shown the sharp declin es that are n ormally asso ciated with  a recession.  Housing starts, perm its, and sales of existing and new hom es in the Midwest all increas ed from  April to May and contacts throughout the District indicate that there has been no no ticeable slowing in housi ng activity in June.   There was an interesting dichotom y in how fi rms were reacting to looser labor m arket conditions. On the one hand, m any firm s employing higher skilled workers a ppeared to be trying even harde r than usua l to avoid layof fs.  Consultin g and law f irms were enc ouraging ne w hires to take tim e off before starting and were asking current em ployees to work part-tim e or take vacations so oner rather than later.  But they ge nerally were n ot letting p eople go.  We had sim ilar reports about skilled jobs in m anufacturing and in certain segm ents of the building trades.  On the other hand, lower skilled  workers were being let go at a faster-than -expected pace.  One senior executive with m any years of experience in the temporary services indus try characterized the current period as the worst drop fo r his industry that he' d seen in  his career.  Outside the high-tech area, however, he has seen real  evidence of lessened wage pressures. We also held our Academ ic Advisory Counc il meeting last week.  We had a larger than usual tu rnout--leading academ ics plus four business econ omists.  There was a goo d deal of pessim ism about the near-term  outlook for investm ent, especially from  the business econom ists.  No one, however, thought the econ omy would slip into a recession.  Participants raised m any of the issu es co vered in y esterday' s discussi on of the productivity acceleratio n.  The common opinion was that we shou ld be cau tious in basi ng our forecast of productiv ity trends to o heavily 6/26-27/01 89 on the last several years of exce llent perform ance.  The key message, how ever, was that the Fed should not b ecom e com placen t about  inflation.  Many thought we were  giving too little atten tion to inflation, and the academ ics generally thought we had either adjusted policy enough or had already gone too far. Turning to the national econom y, a great deal of uncertainty rem ains about the outlook.  Clearly, econom ic growth stalle d in the second quarter and significant signs of weakness continue. The high- tech overhang will p ersist for som e time and will be a substantia l drag on future investm ent spending.  More generally, the manufacturing sector con tinues to contract and low rates of  capacity utilization will lim it further capital investm ent.  As unem ploym ent continue s to incre ase, slower incom e growth w ill like ly begin to weigh on consum ption growth.  In the absence of further downward econom ic shoc ks, the third and fourth quarters should show improve ment over the current quar ter, but the downward risks to econom ic growth this year remain high. Having said that, there are cl early lim its to how ef fectivel y the real-sid e risks facing the U.S. econom y today can be addressed by low er short-term interest rates.  And I think we' re getting close to those lim its.  So far the core  inflation outlook rem ains reasonably contained.  However, with the real fed funds rate well below its equilibrium  level, the inflation risks becom e greater as tim e passes.  We always have to be alert to that danger. As we said at our last m eeting, there is already a lot of s timulus in the pipeline.  The aggressive policy actions taken by this Comm ittee earlier this year  should soon be having noticeable effects and th e tax cu t will provid e additional stimulus later this year.  If the econom ic turnaround proceeds as quickly as o ur forecas t suggests, th e Comm ittee will need to quickly return policy to a less expansi onary setting of the funds rate. 6/26-27/01 90

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Parry.

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, the Twelfth District econom y decelerated in recen t weeks, with slowing evident in m ost states and sectors, although the grow th rate of California exceeded by  a substan tial m argin the growth rate of  Ohio.  [Laughter] Job growth in the District in April and May averag ed 0.7 percent at an an nual rate, for a net add ition of less than 30,000 jobs. The slowdown has been especially pronoun ced in the District' s technology sector, where firms are laying off workers, writing off inventories, and delaying construction on planned expansions. Between January and May the Distri ct's technology sector has reduced employm ent by nearly 20 ,000 net job s.  Because of the prom inent role that high-tech f irms play in the District, slowing in the tech sector has had a negativ e effect extending well beyond that sector. Energy m arkets in the West have looked al most norm al in recent weeks.  But the region still faces supply and dem and im balances, high prices, and unresolved financial issues.  Wholesale spot electricity prices  in m id-June fell below $100 pe r megawatt hour for the first tim e in over a year, though that still left  prices well above wholesale spot  prices in other areas of the country. The decline in wholesale prices can be attributed to several f actors.  More generation came back on line in California; the price of natu ral gas in the state dropped  close to levels in other m arkets; and the state got  a temporary increase of hydropow er from the Northwest as the winter snow  pack m elted.  Also, with the long-ter m electricity  contract s igned by the s tate, m uch less of Calif ornia' s power is be ing bought on the spot m arket.  Perhaps m ost notable is the decline in energy consum ption.  Electricity usage in California has been low er in every month this y ear com pared with las t year.  The s tate is depending on continued conservation this summ er.  That is because m ost of the planned addition of new capacity will com e on line slowly over the next several m onths and the outlook for 6/26-27/01 91 imports from the Northwest is uncertain.  In addition to voluntary and funded conservation program s in California, the substantial increase in electricity rates should cu rtail dem and.  It's true that over half of households are ex empt from  the recent rate in creas e but others are bein g hit with nearly all bu sinesse s and  are c loser to 50 percen t this ye ar.  While the higher ra tes w ill damp demand, electricity prices in California are now so high that they have neutralized the benefit of the state' s temperate clim ate on energy expenditu res.  While high relative prices are never popular, getting convergence of whol esale and retail rates m ay be the only hope for more order in California' s energy m arket.  It's also important th at the state repay the general fund for the m oney spent by the California' s Departm ent of W ater Re sources and Electricity.  With the $8 billion allocated from the general fund nearly depleted and the issuance of the $12.5 billion in revenue bonds delayed, the Departm ent of Water Resources has secured $4.3 billion in short-term  bridge financing which they likely will draw on in July .  With tax revenue growth slowing along with the econom y, the state is counting on the bond issuance to replen ish its general fund. Turning to the national econom y, the  econom ic news, especially for the industrial sector, has continued to be disa ppointing, even w hen com pared w ith our modest expectations.  We have rev ised down our forecast for real GDP to little gro wth this quarter and to around 2 percen t for the second h alf.  Despite these recen t shor tfalls, o ur best estimate con tinues to be th at econom ic growth will rebound next year, perhap s to the 3 to 3-1/2 percen t range, b ased on the stimulus from the substantial eas ing of monetary policy this year  and also on the recent changes we've seen in fiscal policy.  However, as we all k now, there are downside risks.   First, there is th e obvious risk still in the stock m arket.  The potentia l effects, I believe, are nicely illustrated in the simulation presented in the Greenbook.  Second, we could see a continuation of the pattern that 6/26-27/01 92 has persisted for som e time now in which the do llar keeps rising above e xpectations and foreign growth keep s weakening  more than we expect.  With respect to inflation,  we anticipate increases in the core P CE index of just over 2 percent this year and of just under 2 pe rcent next year.  That is higher than I' d like to see for the long run.  Howe ver, I don' t think we are at the point where the risks of econom ic weakness and future inflat ionary pressures are balanced.  Thank you.

MR. MCTEER. The slowing of the Eleventh District economy intensified in April and directors, Beige Book contacts, and others. The Texas unem ploym ent rate rose to 4-1/2 percent in May and now stands just above the national rate  after five straight m onths of being below the nationa l level, which wa s a fairly rar e occur rence given our dem ographics, especially near the border. Other labor m arket indicators confirm ed the weakness.  Employment declined slightly in the upward trend that began about a year ago. Jobless claim s of over 30 days continue to rise and are roughly double the levels that  prevailed a year ago.  In recent news, but not yet in the statistics, N okia will clo se a Fort W orth plant and lay of f 1,500 workers.  Texas Instr uments will idle two Dallas plants, af fecting 1,80 0 worker s.  And Nortel just announced 10,000 addition al layof fs, many of  which will hit the Dallas a rea.  The Texas s lowdown is af fecting all the m ajor metropolitan  areas.  Austin, our boo mtown throughout  the ’90s because of high-tech,  has had no job growth year-to-date and shar ply rising unem ploym ent.  Weakne ss is re flected in a declin ing office m arket and reduced hom e sales, especially at the high end. El Paso is dealing with a noticeable slowdown largely stemm ing from  the deep cutbacks in m aquiladora production in Juárez. The slowdown in Texas has been com pounded by a drop in expo rts for two successiv e 6/26-27/01 93 quarters. Mexico, our largest tr ading partner, has had two quarter s of decline in GDP.  The pace of construction has slow ed across all categories in the District, but will get a boost from the rebuilding effort in Houston following tropical  storm Allison, which caus ed over $2 b illion in damage.  The views on the economy expressed at our June board of directors meeting were probably the weakest since the credit crunch days of  the early ’90s.  Our director affiliated with Texas Instruments said that the growth of person al computer sales is the lowest in 16 years and the growth of cell phone demand is the lowest and slowest ever.  This is reflected in the demand for all types of chips, with the outlook for r ecovery in that industry being postponed until the second half of next year. Our Enron representati ve reported a dramatic d ecline recently in the demand for energy.  In recent week s the price of natura l gas and wholesale el ectricity has fallen much more sharply than weather conditions or conservation measures would suggest, leading to the inference that the economy is slower than would be indicated by other measures. Our views on the national econom y follow the rough contours of the Greenbook forecast. Our internal models are suggesting a slightly neg ative GDP change this q uarter but we're hopeful that the p ositive impact of m oneta ry and fiscal policy will soon be felt.   Our m ajor concern stem s from  the deteriorating  internati onal outlook.  Mexico is technically in recession, due larg ely to the U.S. manufacturing  recession.  Another con cern is Arg entina and th e gam es being played with the peso. Arge ntine citizens have seen several versions of this movie before and they’ve all had unhappy endings. We hope th at Cavallo can pull another rabbit out of his hat; o therwise this story will have a fam iliar cras h ending. In 1996 the Dallas Fed had a conference on the tequila effect and its im pact on Argentina. It's my hope that we will not ha ve a conference in  2001 on the tango effect and its 6/26-27/01 94 impact on Mexico and other Latin Am erica count ries.  Should such an event occur, it could sidetrack any hopes of a free trad e agreem ent in the W estern He misphere, not to m ention delay, stun, or even stifle a U.S. recovery. I would be less worried on this score were it not for the continued slowing in Europe and the absence of hope for recovery in Japan.  New headwinds are being created to rep lace those th at go  away. Growing slack m ay reduce inflationary pre ssures but that is not guaranteed if the supply side of the economy contr acts faster than dem and.  Neverthe less, either way, priority m ust be given to avoiding a deep, cum ulative re cession.  Given the econom ic outlook and the accum ulating risks we face, it seem s clear that we need  to con tinue to redu ce our target funds rate and rem ove the incentive for borrowers and sp enders to wait for further easing m oves.

MR. SANTOMERO. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Since our May m eeting the m ain change in the econom ic outlook fo r our region is an im provem ent in expectations about future econom ic conditions.  Overall, econ omic activ ity continues to edge up.  News on m anufacturing in our District is som ewhat bett er than that for the nation.  While  manufacturing activity rem ains weak in our District, conditions  have im proved steadily since th e beginning of the year.  Our business outlook survey of m anufacturers for June , which was released last week, showed som e improve ment in the index of general econom ic activity.  Although the indices for new  orders and shipm ents both showed modest declines in June, th ey too are much im proved since earlier in the year. Moreover, survey respondents’ expectations  about activity, new orders, and shipm ents over the next six months m oved up sharpl y.  Of course, it rem ains to be seen if such expectations will be fulfilled. Retail sales rem ain mostly flat in ou r region as th ey do in the nation.  Our Beige Book contacts indicate that cool , wet weather hampered sales of summ er clothing and other 6/26-27/01 95 seasonal m erchandise.  Sales of big ticket item s have been slow as well and several store executives said they are prepared to reduce orders  if sales do not turn up.  Corroboration of this anecdotal ev idence is seen in the Pen nsylvania sales tax collections, which have shown weakness in recent m onths.  Employm ent in the re tail sector has been f lat this y ear. The construction sector is hol ding up fairly well in the region, although recent sales of both existing and new hom es have slowed som ewhat.  The dem and for office and commercial space has so ftened.  The office vacancy rate has held steady in  the Philadelphia cen tral business district so far this y ear, b ut vacancy rates ha ve moved up in som e suburban m arkets, which had been am ong the fastest growing ar eas during this expansion.  Despite the softening in recent activity, construction em ploym ent in our region has increased this year.  However, recent data suggest that the overall employm ent picture for the District has deteriorated som ewhat.  In April and May, payroll em ploym ent declined 0.2 percent in our tri-state area, reve rsing the first-quarter increase. As in the nation, initial claim s for une mploym ent insurance are up sharply since the beginning of  the year. Price incre ases in th e Philade lphia region appear to have caught up to those in the nation. Over 1999 and 2000, CPI inflation in Philadel phia had been less than that for the nation.  So far this year, prices in our region have been  rising m ore sharply, refl ecting strong increases in the costs of m edical care and housing. In summ ary, the econom y in our reg ion continue s to inch up at a slugg ish pace.  In ou r staff’s view, the econom y is near an  inflection point.  We expe ct the regional econom y to grow at a moderate pace over th e second half of the year, he lped by the stim ulus from  lower interest rates and Federal tax cuts. 6/26-27/01 96We hold a sim ilar view on the national econom y.  The economy has turned in a weaker perform ance this year than our staff--and m ost other forecasters, I m ight add--expected.  The inventory correction has been bot h deeper and has taken longer than we an ticipated, an d the slowdown in business investm ent wa s sharper than we expected.  Our current forecast is sim ilar to that of the Greenbook; however, we incorporate further m onetary stim ulus in the near term .  We expect the stim ulative effect of the rate cu ts that the Comm ittee has p ut into p lace to build during the second half of this year and the first half of next year and then begin to subside.  We are m ore optim istic than the Board staff about  inventory corrections, and we see businesses starting to rebuild inv entories very slowly later this year and p icking up th e pace nex t year.  We have stronger GDP growth in the third qua rter than does the G reenbook, but som ewhat less streng th in the fourth quarter.  This d ifference is  largely b ecause we expect tax reb ates to have a bigger pos itive effect in the third quarter than doe s the Board s taff forecast.  Averaging across the second half of 2001, we project GDP growth to be  above 2 percent, whic h is about 1/2 point faster th an the Greenbo ok forecast.  For 2002, our staff forecast and the Greenbook forecast are similar, but we see sligh tly less acceleration in growth over the year.  With rising unemploym ent, a resum ption of fairly strong productivity growth, a nd flat to slightly low er oil prices, we see somewhat better inflation num bers from  mid-2001 through 2002, but we’re not as optim istic on the inflation front as the Greenbook partly becau se we see sm aller increases in unemploym ent. Frankly, I' d be content if either the ba seline Greenbook forecast or the Philadelphia Fed forecast com es to pass.  Unfortunately, as all of us who forecas t kno w, there are risks.  Our sense is that these risks, absent  any reduction in the fed funds  rate, are still biased tow ard the downside. But there are som e upside risks as well.   6/26-27/01 97I believe th e most significant risk factor is the timing of the impact of the policy actions we have already taken. On the downsid e, monetary and fiscal policy stim ulus could come too late to offset weakness in the labor m arket, and that could set in motion a m ore negative scenario than the forecas ts.  With corporate p rofits weak, I'm  concerned that the weak ness in business fixed investm ent, especi ally spending on equipm ent and software, could continue for longer than the forecasts suggest. But there are al so risks that the com bined stim ulus could be stronger than we currently antici pate.  We could be in danger of overdoing it, resulting in a buildup in dem and pressures in the future.  Thus, going forward I believe it' s time to take m ore measured steps, to rem ain forward-looking, and to convey the m essage that the lags in the effect of monetary policy m ean that the Committee will have to temper its actions before the data actually reveal a strong re surgence in econom ic activit y.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an.  Meetings with our Bank’s directors, our small business advisory council, and m embers of  a local high-tech-hea vy quality group, taken together with discussions with  area CEOs and reports from our Beige Book contacts provide similar insights about regional ec onom ic activity.  That is, despit e the continuance of relatively good econom ic data vis-à-vis the rest of the nati on, things are beginning to deteriorate in New England. Current data about regional em ploym ent grow th and state unem ploym ent levels rem ain relatively po sitive.  New England grew over twice as fast as the country as a whole from  May 2000 to May 2001, and all states except Rhode Isla nd have unem ploym ent rates below the U.S. rate. Connecticut continues to have the lowest  unem ploym ent rate in the country.  But this relatively benign situatio n seem s poised to change in a nega tive direction.  Initial claims for 6/26-27/01 98 unem ployment insurance continue to rise.  Manu facturing production hours dropped closer to the national average. And both print want ads and In ternet help-wanted advertising declined sharply this April, with som e flattening s ince then.  Manufacturing contacts we re consider ably more pessim istic than even as recen tly as s ix weeks ag o.  Large hig h-tech firm s like EMC an d Teradyne now report layoffs. One CEO said that in  his thirty-year experi ence he has never seen such a sharp fall-off in dem and.  Small m anufacturer s report that they are trying to hold onto the skilled em ployees that were so hard to find just a few m onths ago but that if things don' t pick up in the third quarte r, they  will have to  begin dow nsizing as well.  Some small f irms, such as computer servicers and f irms that supply se ating for arenas and schools, report healthy conditions. But others more dire ctly involved in the high-tech ch ain as suppliers or outsourcers are dead in the water. In relative term s, the defense industry in the region seem s in be tter shape than other manufacturers.  Contacts report li ttle cyclical variance sin ce defense contracts “m ove to the beat of a different drumm er,” to quote one source.  Nationally, defense orders are rising and, with the exception of subm arine orders in Connecticut, orders  rose in all the othe r New England states and defense-related em ploym ent m ay be firm ing.  Defe nse contractors clearly are awaiting the results of the President’s quadrennial review  in the fa ll, which is expected to  propose increased budget authority for defense. Continuing on a bit of an upbeat note, dete rioration in the loan  portfolios of the region’s largest banks has begun to taper off and remains confined to large syndicated loans in particula r industries like tele communications.  Addition al dow ngrades r elated to the as yet unavailable SNC data rem ain, but these banks al so report strength in m iddle m arket and regional credits. How long this will last, g iven the gl oomier regional outlook, is a question, h owever. 6/26-27/01 99Overall consumer confidence stabilized in May at a level 20 percent below the previous year.  New Englanders remain more positive about the present than the average national consumer but have severely downgraded their e xpectations about the future.  Similarly, the business confidence index for Massachusetts droppe d to its lowest level in nearly 10 years.  Business concerns were more heavily weighted in  the present and less negative about the future, though this was widely interprete d as reflecting a general level of increased uncertainty.   Construction continues to be the fastest growing job category.  Residential m arkets remain stron g, though th e pace of house price increas es has abated a b it.  Comm ercial vacancy rates have jumped, though m ost of the increases are in areas like Boston and Ca mbridge, where space a few months ago was extrem ely hard to fi nd.  Indeed, one of the Bank’s largest tenants who had been poised to move to get more space th an we could provide decided to stay  put and wait out the uncertainty. Rental rates have fallen as well, though only to levels that are solid versus stratospheric, accor ding to m ost reports.   In sum , the region seem s to be sliding, perh aps rapidly, from its position above the fray several m onths ago into a downturn that m ore clos ely resem bles other high-tech oriented areas of the nation. When asked if they see a turnaround, m ost contacts replied “not  yet.”  Optim ists are using this tim e to train employees and to integrat e more fully that last piece of equipm ent or software they purchased, and m any report that thei r focus on productivity is as keen as ever.  Pessim ists are not hard to find and they report no light at the end of the tunnel. Turning to the nation al data, th ere’s  not much to distingu ish our forecas t for the remainder of the year from  the Greenbook’s.  Next year the rebound to potential is almost immediate in the Green book, while our forecast refl ects a more gradu al return.  Both forecasts suggest that unem ployment will rise to som ething like 5-1/2 pe rcent or so in 2002 and that 6/26-27/01 100 inflation will level off if not decline, dependi ng on the m easurem ent used.  One could debate differing NAIRU assumptions, I suppose, and thes e are im portant; but for the tim e period m ost relev ant to today’s policy decision, there is li ttle difference b etween the two forecasts.  The question is whether one is sati sfied with this projected outco me and what the risks surrounding that forecast seem  to be. I must say that I’ve been struck by a sense of increasing uncertain ty on the downside.  This is no t sim ply because New England now s eems to be m irroring o ther areas of the nation.  Overall, the data seem  increas ingly d ownbeat, pa rticula rly as they re late to foreign growth, corporate profits, and business inve stment.  With regard to layoffs , one cannot help but think that the other shoe m ay be in the pr ocess of falling, especi ally if dem and doe s not strengthen a bit in the third quarter. If so, then the consum er could well stop being the m ainstay of the expansion even with th e stim ulus of  the ta x cut.  If people are losing their jobs, th e tax cut m ay well a ll go to reduce debt or increase savings, w ith little imm ediate im pact on c onsum ption.  Indeed, I continue to wonder what a full percentage  point uptick in unem ploym ent does to spending and whether our m odels fully capture that and, m ore im porta ntly, if that outcom e is desirable in an environm ent of m oderating inflation.  That woul d be roughly another m illion and half people or so who want to work but can’t  find employm ent, or about doubl e the increase from  Novem ber 2000 to now. It seem s to m e that that sort of change in a relatively short period could have spinoff effects that are hard to cap ture. On the other hand, m onetary policy ease has be en aggressive to date and fiscal policy will prov ide a further impetus earl ier than expected.  Not everyone works  in high-tech  and related service and tem porary help industries, and con tinued layoffs by these firm s may not have the same broad-based effect as the de cline in autos and stee l had late last year.  In fact, I found the 6/26-27/01 101 paper yesterday on the capital overhang extrem ely helpful in thinking about  the situation and at least a little reassuri ng.  There m ay be no “killer apps,” as the phrase goes, on the horizon, but after a year of decline in leve ls of investm ent, sm all changes in technology and increasing final demand could spur further rates of investm ent ove r the next six to nine months.  Clearly, the Greenbook assum es this will be the case. Finally, while rates of inflationary growth seem  to have m oderated a bit and financial policy ease is enough and when to step back. There m ay well be headro om now for a bit m ore ease, but I continue to believe  that caution is necessary.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.   I've commented for som e time that the District econom y has been perform ing m uch like the national econom y, and th at continues to be the cas e.  The weakness and problem s are con centrated in the m anufactur ing and m ining sectors where activity is clearly declining. Labor m arket conditions are easing, although net job creation remains positive.  On the other hand, the constr uction sector, both reside ntial and nonr esidential, is healthy. Consum er spending has held up and tourism  could proba bly be described as mediocre--no better, no worse. The one thin g that has ch anged is attitudes,  which clearly have deteriorated accord ing to the an ecdotal reports I’m  receiving .  I think th ey’ve deterio rated p rincip ally because of what has happened in the labor m arket.  The easing conditions in that  market, the layoffs and job losses both regionally and nationally, have captured a lot of attention and I think have convinced a lot of participants in the econom y that indeed  the econom y’s perform ance has stalled or perhaps even worse. 6/26-27/01 102At the natio nal lev el, my view isn' t all th at different from  the view expressed in the baseline forecast in the Greenbook. I do think th e invento ry correction p rocess still h as som e considerable way to go, and as a con sequence I e xpect th e reacceleration in growth to occur a little later an d initially to  be a bit m ore modest  than in the Greenbook forecast.  Nevertheless, I am confident that a reaccelerati on will occur and that next y ear econom ic growth will be a good deal better than it is going to turn o ut to be this year. I believe th e risks at th is stage are reasonabl y symm etric.  Of course, it' s possible that the contraction in capital spending could be m ore severe than we curren tly expect o r that consum er spending could weaken as the unem ploym ent rate rises.  But it seem s to m e that monetary policy has largely allowed for this al ready and, of course, we have fiscal stimulus in train as well. In any event, I think we need to bear in m ind, as I’ve said before, the lags between our actions and their effects as well as our res ponsibility to prom ote su stained economic progress by keeping inflation and infla tionary expecta tions  low. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, I think our District' s econom y has weakened since the last FOMC m eeting.  All the inform ation we get on m anufacturi ng suggests that that sector, at least in our region, is continuing to decline and that the decline may have accelerated a bit in recen t months.  We also conduct a monthly m anufacturing survey, as d oes your Bank, Tony, and I'm struck by the differences between yours and ours.  All of the indicators we looked at in our latest survey--shipm ents, new orders, capacity utilization, and em ploym ent--were down sharply in April and May. In addition to the gene ral deceleration in de mand, the basic m ainline industries in our region, textiles and furniture, are also being ne gatively affected by increasingly 6/26-27/01 103 intense competition, especially from  China, which I think has been heightened by the strong dolla r. With respect to consum er spending, as else where in the country new car sales have held up surprisingly well, but spending on non-auto  durable goods and servic es has been weaker recen tly.  One of our board m embers in Richm ond is  the retired chairm an of a large departm ent store ch ain and he receiv es a lo t of data on departm ent store sales.   He gave m e som e inform ation a few days ago on store sales in the first three weeks of June and indicated that even when corrected for prom otional program s and so fort h, sales were quite w eak in that period. Housing activity still looks rather good in our  District m arkets.  New home sales, as elsewhere in  the country,  have been strong m ost recently and new residen tial perm its are alm ost 10 percent higher than they were  a year ago.  Commercial real estate activity, on the other hand, has weakened. District labor m arkets have loosened further overall.  Actually, unem ploym ent rates a re down a bit in three of our jurisd ictions--D.C., Maryland, and W est Virg inia.  But in the states that have heavy concentrations of m anufacturing activity, unem ploym ent is  up.  That’s especially true in North Carolina where the unem ploym ent rate has m oved up from  3.6 pe rcent last May to a little over 5 percent this May. On the natio nal econom y, I think the situation we face today is not all that different from  what it was at the tim e of our May m eeting.  Investm ent in both high-tech and in more traditional capital goods is quite weak.  But household spend ing still seems to be hold ing up better than m ight have been expected.  On bala nce, as the Greenbook put it,  there is weakness but it does no t yet seem  to be cum ulating in the wa y that has characterized previous reces sions. 6/26-27/01 104At the May m eeting I talked about the curr ent situation in comparison with the 1992­93 period w hen, at least by som e measures, the real funds rate was last at a quite low level.  I argued then that if econom ic activity were cu rrently at a bottom, we probably had enough stimulus in the pipeline.  And in fact, the Gr eenb ook point forecast does show real GDP growth at or very near a bottom  in the second quarter without any further easing of monetary policy.  Of course, as w e all know, in the forecast this bo ttoming seem s to result m ainly from  the monetary stimulus that is already in the pipeline, the anticipated add itional fi scal stim ulus, and the completion of at least a good bit of the inventory co rrection by the end of th e third quarter.  That' s the Greenbo ok point forecast.  But clearly, the to ne of the Greenbook co mmentary focused mostly on the downside risks in the outlook. That' s entirely appropriate, in m y view, since we do have a dram atic weakening in equipm ent invest ment which, if anythi ng, could be intensifying currently. Given that downside risk, I think a case clearly can be m ade for  further m onetary stimulus.  Our actions to date have undoubted ly helped to shore up household spending in interest-sens itive sec tors.  And that h as probably helped to of fset som e of the cum ulating weakness in equipm ent investm ent.  At this point,  again by som e measures, the re al funds rate is at a ve ry low level.  But it' s not at z ero yet.  So there is still s ome leeway  to bring it d own a bit further. But frankly, and this is the m ain point I would m ake--it echo es comm ents that a number of other peop le have m ade--I really doub t that additio nal in terest rate cu ts at th is point are going to do a lot to deal w ith the critica l weakness in eq uipm ent investm ent.  What I'm hearing frequently from  members of our boards and other business contac ts is that a rebound in investm ent spending is unlikely to occur until in vesting businesses have som e sense that the econom y is at a bottom  or very, very close to a botto m.  So I think the direct stim ulative effect of 6/26-27/01 105 low real short rates on the econom y overall m ay not be very substant ial at this point, w hich m ight tempt us to move rates even lower.  But that cou ld be a m istake because o nce a botto m is perceived to  be reach ed, very low real short rate s may becom e very stim ulative, with b usinesses poised--as I think m any are--to resum e investing to profit from  opportunities presented by the still rapid pace of technological prog ress.  So the risk, as I see it, is  that if a bottom  is conf idently reached soo ner rather th an later, lab or markets w ill still be relatively firm and the in flation rate And in that situation it m ay be very difficult for us to reverse field and tighten policy as quickly as needed to keep both inflation and inflati on expectations from moving back up.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, not a great deal  has changed in the Tenth District.  Our econom y does rem ain sluggish, as it was at the time of our May m eeting.  Manufacturing overall remains in the doldrum s.  Capacity utilization co ntinues to decline and plant m anagers say that they are still working with inventories that they  feel are too high.  Firm s are delaying som e of their expansion plans but the dichotomy a mong fi rms is interesting, reflecting som ewhat the contrasts m entioned in yesterday' s discu ssion.  A Corning plant in Oklahom a, which manufactures optical fiber, ha s delayed additions to its capac ity for obvious reasons.  On the other hand, one of our m etal fabri cators, while saying that the m anufacturing industry is still in recession, reports th at they are beg inning to see li ght at the end of the tun nel.  They are seeing some strengthening of orders, so they are m ore optim istic.  That reflects , I think, a bit of the contrast in the econom y. Consum er spending has held up better than m ight have been expect ed, but the outlook obviously rem ains quite uncertain in these tim es.  While there are som e signs of a rebound in 6/26-27/01 106 consum er confidence within the region, we ar e still seeing some cutback s in discretion ary spending, especially in the consum ption patter ns of som e of our hi gher incom e households. Residential construction  has held steady but the dem and for housing, based on recen t anecdotal data at least, is show ing signs of slowing.  Sales are down som ewhat from  a year ago.  In most of our m arkets the inventory of unsold homes has increased and housing inflation in our cities has slo wed, especially in Denver where it had been m ost prom inent.  The picture is m uch the sam e in commercial real esta te.  Constructi on is holding steady but there is som e downward pressure on prices and rents.  Again, Denver is showing som e increased problem s, partly reflecting th eir high-tech  orien tation, because Le vel 3, one of the com panies building  some of these fiber optic networks, has laid off a considerable num ber of e mployees. The energy sector rem ains a strong f actor in  our econom y.  The rig count rose again in degree by a shortage of labor and equipm ent for th at industry.  Our agricultural economy rem ains mixed; m eat producers are doing well a nd grain producers ar e doing very poorly. As for the labor m arket, firm s are finding it easier than it was  a year ago to hire workers. From  highly trained IT specialists to retail and other lower skilled workers, the m arket has eased up. The unemploym ent rate hasn' t budge d a whole lot, though, esp ecially since our last meeting.  The proportion of business contacts repo rting labor shortages has been about the sam e recen tly as it was in March.  Reflecting the slugg ishness, wag e pressu res have eased s omewhat in our area and overall price pressures al so have remained relatively subdued. Turning to the national situation, I have m arked down m y growth projections for the near term  but rem ain fairly optim istic, in line w ith the Greenbook, in terms of the longer run.  I now expect the econom y to grow at a sustaina ble rate approxim ating the econom y’s potential by 6/26-27/01 107 the end of th e forecast ho rizon.  At th e sam e time, I've becom e more concerned about the inflationary pressures that m ay follow.  Price pr essures should be contained for the tim e being.  I recognize that the curren t stance of policy has the potential  to push up the underlying inflation rate as we go forward. It is not surprising, of course, that the outlook for the U.S. econom y remains pessim istic in the nea r term, which I think stil l reflects som e of the lagged effects of tighter monetary policy and higher energy prices from last year.  And as we discussed yesterday, I believe it also reflects a buildup of excess capacity in im portant sectors such as telecommunications and technology as well as a significant slowdown in foreign econom ies. In this environm ent, Mr.  Chairm an, our accommodative po licy has begu n to reverse the effects of our previously tig hter policy and has had an im pact on certain sectors in term s of increasing dem and in those areas.  It is not clear, though, that furthe r easing can immediately revers e the effects of som e of the other factors that I' ve just  mentioned.  Of course, the question we now confront centers on whether we should ease  further to better assure  recovery or whether in a determ ined effort to turn things around we m ay be easing too m uch and therefore risk overshooting our longer-run goals. I acknowledge that it is difficult to be patien t in an environm ent of rising em ploym ent and slowing growth but that, of c ourse, is what I am suggesting he re.  I keep com ing back to the following lo gic:  By m ost estim ates the real fe d funds rate is below the eq uilibrium  long-term rate, and policy is by that defini tion accommodative; additional fiscal  stimulus is in process and will have an  impact on the econom y later th is year  and next; monetary po licy works with a lag, as others have said here today, which suggests that  our recent easing m oves have yet to be fully experienced; they will have increasing influence la ter this year and next.  I adm it that we don' t  6/26-27/01 108 know if we are being to o accomm odative, bu t the risks of that are certa inly in creasing.  I'm concerned that if we follow a policy in which ra tes are set m uch below current levels and they remain there over the next year, we risk over- stimulating the econom y in 2002 and we risk higher inflation in 2002 and beyond. Thank you.

MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  My conversations with officials at FedEx and UPS lead m e to describe th e situation as being essentiall y unchanged since the last tim e I talked with them .  My Fe dEx contact said that th e firm ’s custom ers are expecting flat v olume for the next three to four m onths; Fe dEx sees business as e ssentially stabilize d at the curr ent lev el.  The firm ’s express volum e is down about 7 pe rcent year over year, but ground volum e is up by about the sam e amount. That’s esse ntially the sam e kind of picture m y contact described six or eight weeks ago. International vol ume is still showing positive grow th of 2 to 3 percent year.  FedEx business in Europe is doing w ell while tha t in Asia is weak. On the labor m arket, FedEx is not planni ng layoffs but has built into its plan an assum ption of attrition, not replacing all the wo rkers who leave.  But FedEx is finding that turnover is unusually low for the pr ofessional ranks of the firm ; it’s typically 5 to 6 percent and is now about half of that, according to my contact.  That suggests that people are developing som e concerns about their ability to find new e mploym ent should they leave th eir jobs.  Blue-collar turnover is also down. FedEx reports  no difficult y in hiring n ew people to  fill position s when that is necessary. As with other contacts, FedE x is concerned about heal th-care costs.  Those costs are back to double-digit rates of increa se an d that' s a noticeab le prob lem for them. The tone of the story from UPS was a littl e more pessim istic but roughly the sam e as the situation at FedEx. UPS is reducing its cap acity som ewhat by taking som e smaller aircraft 6/26-27/01 109 out of service and also putting som e ground delive ry trucks into storage.  UPS reports that volum e in Europe is holding up fairly well and volum e in As ia continues to be weak, which echoes the FedEx picture. UPS continues to m anage its dom estic business quite tightly--holding the line on hiring, using the phone instead of traveling, and th at kind of thing. My contac t at W al-Mart said th at the com pany ha d seen som e slight signs of weaker demand.  I thought the firm ’s analysis of recent d evelopm ents was rather interesting.  Wal-Mart has a m id-month and a month-end cycl e to their business.  The month- end cycle is tied to transfer paym ents that are paid out on a m onth-end basis.  That cycle s eems to be a little weak er but a norm al pattern continues at m id-month, which typical ly is the regular payche ck cyc le.  Wal-Mart has noted a shift in dem and toward lower priced m erchandise in any given lin e.  In ap parel--a line of shirts, let' s say--the openi ng price point, or the lowest pric ed item  in the line, has stronger demand than the higher priced item s.  The situation is quite atypical.  No one there can rem ember such a large shift of this type unde r conditions of the sort that we ha ve.  Custom er traffic is flat to slightly higher and there is a he althy m ix between the to tal traffic and the average siz e of a sales ticket. That is, people are contin uing to spend about as m uch as  they had before, despite this apparen t shift toward lo wer pric ed item s. My contact was questioning m e on what I m ight know about the likely ef fects of the tax rebates. I could only talk at a rather abstract level but I did refer him  to the 1975 experience, which his people are going to be looking at caref ully.  Wal-Mart’s inventories are on the lean side and one of the things they’re concerned about is that if a noticeable pickup in consum er dem and materializes as a consequ ence of the tax rebates, their stores are going to be out of stock on som e items.  So they are debating about whether to step up their orders.  My contact said that the retail sector in gen eral is f airly lean on inv entories; it' s also true of their com petitors.  He m ade a big 6/26-27/01 110 point about m edical costs.  In his words they are “going throu gh the roof,” up 15 to 20 percent this year. The com pany had expected increases more in the neighborhood of 7 percent but now is expecting the situation to be worse next year. My contact said he is not seeing price pressures from  vendors, but he noted what he called a “laten t desire” by vendors to raise prices.  That is, vendors don' t have room  to do it now, but with a pi ckup in dem and they would want to put som e price increases through. Everyone is  faced with cost pressures that  they are try ing to deal with. Let m e offer a few comm ents on our current situation.  I think th e econom ic situation we face has m any unique characteris tics.  It is decidedly atyp ical of U.S. business cy cle experience. That m eans that we don' t have a lot of the typical patterns that help inform our judgm ents about it.  The downturn has been concen trated to an unusual ex tent in a particular sector of the econom y, manufacturi ng.  I believe that real adjustm ents are necessary in that area and they are being m ade.  Obviously , a contrac tion is tak ing place in the dot-com  and telecom industries, and that contraction is going to continue no m atter what happens to m onetary policy.  Expectations by those industries were too buoyant a year ago.  Those expectations have not been met and are not going to be m et within the next fe w years.  So those firm s are going to have to contract and they are contracting. On a m ore general basis, I think earnings e xpectations and the stock m arket have been too high. The notion that earnings can grow at 12 to 15 percent for an extended period of tim e when the national economy, at reasonably stable  inflation, is going to be growing at 6 or 7 percent, doesn' t add up.  It doesn' t fit.  So those earnings expectations are going to have to adjust over tim e.  I'm talking no t just about the curren t year and nex t year, but ab out the long er-run earnings expectations. Probably som e adjustm ent is going to have to take place in price-earnings ratios; by conventional m easures the stock m arket is  still generously price d.  I call th at a real 6/26-27/01 111 adjustm ent because it reflects a ttitud es toward th e future.  It's not fundamentally a no minal phenom enon but relates  to attitud es about risks and the likely  course of earnings.  In my view we probably are going to see a continuing adjustm ent bringing price-earnings ratios m ore in line with historical experience. That doesn' t mean that P/ E ratio s will go back to historical av erages bu t rathe r that they will be m ore in tune with past ex perien ce. The staff and private sector forecasts of  where the econom y is going are broadly in agreem ent.  Those point estim ates make perfect sense to m e.  There is no guarantee, of course, that we' re going to ge t exactly that o utcom e, and we have to be aware of the potential risks on both sides. Housing continues to do well, as m any pe ople have comm ented.  I think that' s important, not just b ecause housing investm ent involves a significant nu mber of dollars but because it is perhaps th e best sing le measure of  confidence among those in the household sector.  People don' t comm it them selves to large m ortgage s--very big financial comm itments over a long period of tim e--if they don' t have a significant am ount of confidence in the future.  I put a lot more weight on the actual perform ance of the housing m arket than I do the survey data on consum er confidence. The m onetary policy background, I think, has be en very expansionary.  Money growth, no m atter how m easured, has been high for som e time--and we’re not talki ng about a m atter of a few weeks or a few tenths of a percentage point.  We don' t have to quibb le about exactly what it is. The staff docum ents, of course, report M2.  I like to add MZM to the m ix of m oney m easures; it is the definition that I think m ost closely co rresponds to the Friedm an-Schwartz M2 definition that produces a continuous series back to the time of the Civil War.  MZM has grown 15 percent in the last year; it has grown in excess of 20 percent at an ann ual rate in th e last six m onths.  We 6/26-27/01 112 are creating or perm itting to be created a very larg e am ount of liquidity.  The largest m istakes in U.S. monetary policy history have come, I thi nk, from ignoring money growth, and I believe it would be unfortunate in the extrem e if we, too, made that mistake. As for other m easures, certainly credit markets are accomm odative.  The amount of funds being raised is am ple, and firm s that  are reasonably creditworthy have no difficulty borrowing through interm ediaries or directly in the markets.  The real federal funds rate is on the low side of estim ates of the e quilibrium  rate.  Any way you cut it, it seems to m e there is no question that m onetary policy is in a very e xpansionary m ode.  A num ber of people have commented about the lags in the process. A lot of the m onetary policy ease has com e relatively recen tly.  We would not expect to see it show up in real activ ity righ t away. I think the inflation risks ar e rising.  I note that we have  been counting on declining energy prices. One of the things I asked m y staff to do was to look at what has happened to crude oil futures for the December 2001 and the December  2002 contracts.  From  them  we see that the date when energy price declin es will take place k eeps getting pushed into the future.  I have a chart that goes back to th e beginning of 1998, when the December 2001 and the December 2002 crude futures contracts were bot h trading at about $19 a barrel.  Over the course of 1998 they went down a little but they have been increasing steadily since th en and actually increased a good bit over the last year. So in term s of where o il prices are going over the next couple of years, what looked like a fairly quick retu rn to a per barrel price in th e low $20s is now m ore likely to be in the neighborhood of the m id-$20s.  I think we are in danger of building in som e more-or­less perm anent increases in oil prices, and in m y view we should not just take that out of our price indexes and ignore th e fact that it' s there. 6/26-27/01 113How the econom y is going to evolve in co ming months is obviously going to depend on how m arkets respond to the outcom e of this mee ting.  I think it' s interesting to note that the ten-year bon d rate today is about the sam e as it was in Decem ber of last y ear.  I don' t know of any period in which the federal funds rate ha s changed by such a large amount and there is nothing to show, really, in the l onger rates.  This is a very un usual circum stance.  Clearly the impetus of monetary polic y into investm ent spending is going to  work at least in part through the behavior of long-term  rates of interest.  And if monetary policy is in fact not pressing those long-term rates of interest down, we 're not going to see a quick response in longer-lived kinds of investm ents.  Investm ent spending is  not going to respond to what we do. I think we' ve gotten ourselves into som ething of a bind in term s of the market’s expectations of where we are go ing.  In my view the language in  our balance of risks statem ent has turned o ut to be a forecast of what we’re go ing to do at ou r next m eeting.  I think the m arket reads it that way. If we look at  the history since we’ve used that  language, it has in fact been a perfect or almost perfect forecast of our action at the next m eeting.  To me, that’s clearly th e way the m arket interprets it.  Unfortunately I think we  have a prob lem because if we say the risks are weighted to ward econo mic weakness, the m arket is going to take th at as a forecas t of m ore ease to com e.  If we choose a neutral balance of risk s statem ent, though, I'm  concerned that the m arket would take that as a forecast of nothing m ore to com e.  To m e that would also be very unfortunate because whether there is more ease to come or whether we will sta rt to m ove in the other direction is going to be dr iven very im portantly by the inf ormation we get in th e com ing weeks and months. So I hope that som ehow we can  get across the idea that  the current situation is not typical but has a lot of ve ry unusual aspects.  This is a ra ther unique situation and we are not frozen into a course of continuing to lower ra tes, which would be m y biggest fear.  Given m y 6/26-27/01 114 interpretation of how the m arket is reading that language, I would consider it very undesirable to have a balance of risks statem ent weighted towa rd econom ic weakness.  I think that’s just a signal to the  markets th at there are several m ore steps of ease to com e no m atter what we do with the funds rate today. That would open us up to a difficult situation if it turns out that we feel compelled to reverse direction as the data com e in.  So I hope we can give the m arkets the impression that our best guess is that we are now finished easing, but that we are very open to responding to incom ing infor mation that m ight require  rates to be either higher or lower in the future. I think we need to convey that there is no conviction on our part as to the direction in which we will m ove the funds rate in com ing m eetings.  Than k you.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Befor e I comm ent on the Second District I would like to say tha t I think tha t assessment of  the m arket’s interpretation of the balance of risks statem ent is com pletely wrong.  I believe the m arket looks at incom ing data and tries to evaluate what the Fe deral Reserve will do.  That' s what the m arket looks at. To m y mind, any notion that what we say about the balance of risks is tied to or determ ines our next m ove involves fa lling in to the intellectu al trap of post hoc, ergo propter hoc . Anybody who has ever studied logic has been  taught that that is a great fallacy. As for the Second District, we apparently should have m igrated south slightly to Philadelphia! Whereas the scene of relative pr osperity had been centered in New England and the Second District, it appears to  have m oved a way from  President Minehan and m e.  Econom ic growth in the Second District has shown distinct signs of sl owing since the last tim e this Comm ittee was together.  Employment  growth in the District has deteriorated sharply.  In New York State, private sector job growth slowed from a roughly 2 pe rcent annual rate in the first 6/26-27/01 115 quarter to a 0.3 percen t pace in April and May.  In New Jersey, private sector em ploym ent, which was virtually flat in the first qua rter, declin ed at a 2 percen t pace in April and at a 1 percent rate in May. New York' s unem ploym ent rate has he ld steady recently at 4.3 percent, while New Jersey' s has risen from  3.6 to 4.3 per cent in just the past three months. Manufacturing em ployment has con tinued to sh rink at rough ly a 4 percen t pace, in lin e with its tr end over the p ast yea r.  Construction employm ent is up nearly 5 percen t from a year ago, though it has leveled off in recent m onths.  Job growth in  services--an d that' s a leading driver of our regional econom y--has  decelerated in recen t months but remains fairly strong at an annualized 2 percent pace. In the region' s key financial services industry employm ent fell noticeably in both April and May after rising through March.  The disarray in the m ajor securities firms is continuing.  You no doubt noticed the pr ofits warning from  Merrill Lynch.  The firm s on Wall Street that have a v ery strong b ond trad ing and underwriting capability have don e relativ ely well, shif ting their prof it realiza tions to th at area from  investme nt banking and equities. Consum er spending is holding up reasonably we ll.  Retail sales appear to have picked up in la te May and ear ly June with the arr ival of  warm er weather.  But they rem ain little chang ed from  a year ago and are still okay but a little on the sluggish side.  Selling prices and m erchandise costs are steady to som ewhat lower, and wage pre ssures in th e consum er area app ear to be rath er subdued. Everybody in the District, as we have been hearing from  other Reserve Bank presidents about their Districts, continues to complain about the escalating costs of health benefits and utilities. We have a shift in the balance of prosperity  and lack thereof in New York State.  The upstate area, with the partial exception of Buffalo, is  actually looking quite good.  And the New York City area, because of the financial se rvices industry, is looking relatively weak.  6/26-27/01 116 Comm ercial real estate h as deterio rated further since we were last together but hom e sales and construction have rem ained robust.  The Manhattan  office market has slackened substantially in recen t months.  Asking rents are still up from  where they were a year ago, but those rents are usually not being realized; deal s are being m ade at considerably below the asking price.  Availability rates in downtown Ma nhattan have risen from  5.4 to 6 percent and are going to rise further; in midtown they are up fr om 3.4 to 6.1 percent.  So the bloom  is definitely off the rose in New York C ity. The f inancia l serv ices in dustry is a m ajor source of tax revenue for both New York City and New York State and, therefore, the fis cal situation of the city a nd the state will certainly be deteriorating. Inflation levels in the Distri ct are about similar to those of the nation.  As for the international situation, I think it continues to deteriorate.  I believe Karen Johnson’s report yesterd ay outlined that well, as have certain rem arks this m orning. On the natio nal econom y, our Bank’s forecast is  about the sam e as the Greenbook’s, so I won' t quibble on the details.  We have the same vi ew tha t the risks are very substan tially to the downside. I think we ha ve to acc ept the f act that until we ge t into nex t year, busine ss fixed investm ent will r emain very weak.  So in m y view  our role a s a central b ank is to think of  what we can do to keep consum er confide nce about as r obust as it is, which is ve ry necessary for all of our forecas ts.  And with that, bus iness confidenc e will a t least not ge t any  worse and will recover with the benefits of m onetary policy, fiscal stim ulus, and re latively subdued price increases. At the FOMC m eeting in May, when we we re last together, I had hoped very m uch that we would be able to go to a balanced risks st atem ent at this m eeting and at least pause in our easing. Unfortunately, I think the downside risk is even greater today than it was at the tim e of our previou s meeting.  So I believe we have to continue to offer an acco mmodative monetary 6/26-27/01 117 policy. But I do think w e have to s low down its pace.  If we were to keep  easing at th e pace of 50 basis points a crack, that would seem  to be overdoing it.  That amount of monetary stim ulus would seem  to indicate that we think the econom y is even weaker than we in fact think it is.  With the combination of m onetary stim ulus, wh ich in m y view should total 275 basis points by the tim e we leave today, plus the amount of fiscal stim ulus that  we all anticipate, the likelihood of our forecast be ing rig ht is im proved som ewhat .  But I th ink the risk s still will be to the downside. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Six m onths ago policy was very restrictive, as evidenced in th e Bluebook chart on the real funds  rate.  Given the sharp drop in spending dem ands, we knew that the stance of policy had to be changed dram atically and quickly. One could quibble about the details, bu t basically w e made this transition and now policy is clearly accommodative.  Even a relatively acerbic critic like John Makin is complimenting the Fed for being attuned to reality  and doing its job.  And he has attributed the strong dollar partly to the fact that we' ve been  more effective than other central banks.   That was then; this is now. It's alwa ys tricky to know when and how to stop a prolonged m ovem ent in rates, and we are faced w ith th at uncertainty.  Our job becom es even more com plicated by wh at seem s to be a real sch ism between the outpu t forecas ters and the financial forecasters. The output forecasters h ave respond ed to th is steady drum beat of weak data by lowering their forecasts. Every m onth as new, weak data arrive, the fo recasters write down the near term  and push out the date of the bouncebac k.  Dave Stockton pointed out yesterday that revisions to the Blue Chip forecast have been  much larger than  revisions to  the Greenb ook 6/26-27/01 118 forecast, bu t both sets of forecasters h ave basi cally followed this strategy.  With the capital deepening link, the Greenbook even writes down l ong-term  growth rates.  According to projections m ade earlier in the year the econom y should already be snapping back by now, but of course it is n ot.  And at p resent, n ear-term  forecasts look roug hly as gloo my as they d id earlier in the year. This forecas ting strategy has also been  followed for Europe, Asia, and Latin Am erica.  In each of th ese areas, sp ending data have been  weak, forecas ts have been revised dow n, and recovery dates have been pushed back. But for the financial forecasters, especially  those influencing long-term  bond m arkets, we encounter different behavior .  As short rates go down, i mplied forward rates often go up.  Econom ic theory would attribute these rises in forw ard rates to expectations  of higher inflation.  But frankly, I don' t see much evidence of such expect ations either in direct  measures of inflation anticipations or in leadin g indicators such as co mmodity prices or producer prices. Moreover, those who feel that anticipated inflation is in some way related to unem ploym ent or output gaps should be looking for reductions in inflation, not increases. The analys ts who m ake earnings forecasts are so mewhere in the m iddle.  When the weak data arrive, they seem  to revise their projections downward ju st like the outpu t forecas ters.  They also p ush back their an ticipated recovery d ates.  But w hile they do n't actually have f uture earnings forecasts rising , they put in pretty  strong  rebounds, n ot unlik e the bond forecasters. In som e ways these differing forecasting st rategies reflect our own quandary.  If the output forecasters were right, weak data could be viewed as weak da ta and we could take appropriate action. But given the behavior of the bond forecasters,  there' s a reasonable chance that such a move would be m et by no change or even increas es in long-term rates and  in the co st 6/26-27/01 119 of capital facing those who invest in houses and other capital equi pment.  We could take action, but our action m ight not revive  the econom y much or at l east would be st rongly diluted. There ar e, of course, potentia l resolutions to this conf lict.  One is th at lon g-term  rates are rising for som e other reason--say, the lowered expectations that T reasury debt will vanish.  But swap rates should not be m uch affected by such expectations and those rates have been virtually unchanged throughout the period of our  rate reductions in 2001, though they did fall slightly last year before we  began lowering short rates. Another potential resolu tion is that these fo recas ters will co me together.  Either the output forecasters will decide that  there is m ore chance of an  early and vigorous recovery or the bond forecasters will decide that forward rates s hould not be so high.  One could think of m any other such r esolutions.  In the end th ere m ay be litt le we can do but pick our horse an d ride it.  To me the Greenbook baseline forecast seem s sensible and there are plen ty of downside risks in that.  Earnings forecasts m ight get rev ised down agai n and the s tock m arket m ight weaken.  These earnings disappointm ents and the capital overha ng m ight dampen the rebound in business fixed investm ent.  This Greenbook forecast already de scribes a rather weak econom y, and anecdotal evidence of layoffs, spending plans, and so forth ce rtainly has confirm ed that  picture.  In this view, even though m onetary policy has alrea dy emphatically switched to a posture of accomm odation, a bit m ore can be do ne to help revi ve the eco nomy.  Bond traders m ay dilute the effects of our actions but they m ay also fall into line.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Since our last m eeting, the incom ing data have indicated to me at least that it is stil l too early to declar e that the econom y has 6/26-27/01 120 bottom ed.  While we knew that the data would be w eak, in fact they have been weaker than we expected. The gradual erosion of the national econom y appears to be unabated. The m anufacturing sector c ontinues  to face a daunting en vironm ent.  With capacity utilization at a level nearly m atching the lows of the 1990-91 peri od, this sector could legitim ately be described  as being in recession.  More im portantly for th e longer term , production of high-tech goods fell sharply in May and April, and industry cont acts suggest th at inventories remained bloated in both the sem iconductor a nd communications equipm ent industries.  And while com puters m ay have hit bottom, that indust ry is unlikely to reve rse its relativ ely flat production pattern quickly. Yesterday’s orders and shipm ents data, while a surprise to the as Dave Stockton has indicated.  Importantly, w hile m anufacturing has been the center of this cyclical episode, the NAPM nonm anufacturing index suggests the pos sibility that this weakness Evidence from  the labor m arkets similarly suggests continued weakness.  The m ost recen t employm ent repo rt ind icates that busin esses are s till either shedd ing workers in  som e cases or add ing workers at a m uch more gradu al pace.  In add ition, bus inesses are m aintain ing hours of production and nonsupervisory workers at a level below that of the first quarter.  Weekly initial claims data point to ward ongoing labor m arket wea kness and, at the m id-400,000 range, initial claims are at levels not t oo dissim ilar from those seen in 1991. To be sure, there has been som e good news .  The housing sector continues to hold up well and con sumer confi dence appears to be firm er.  But thes e are ex ceptions in the face of mainly negative news.  As Dave Stockton not ed and Governor Gram lich just reiterated, forecasters in both the F ederal Reserve and the private sector have trimmed their nea r-term 6/26-27/01 121 outlooks. While m ost have faith th at the econo my will not have even o ne quarter of negativ e growth, I think confidence in that relatively favor able outcome, at least for m e, has been tested with alm ost every new p iece of data.  However, as many have indicated, p olicy works with a lag and hence w e must try to discern the future.  Unfortunately, the future is  distinctly murky and some factors are likely to weigh on the econom y more than the baseline forecast envisions. In the business sector, analysts expect a rapid rebound in earnings.  But given the ongoing weakness of the econom y, it’s hard to have a ny certainty that these observers are correct.  Should earnings disappoint, as seem s likely, the a ppetite of businesses for new investm ents m ay well be slower to rebound than m any currently assum e.  And investors would see som e further erosion of wealth as well, whic h could weigh on consum er spending. Another im ponderable is the effect of the tax cut.  It certainly will add s timulus in the second half of this year and goi ng forward.  The question is how m uch, I think, and that is subject to som e uncertainty.  We can m ake assum ptions a bout the m arginal propensity to consum e out of tax cuts and how that co nsum ption will be d ivided across imported good s, goods co ming out of inventories, and new production. But we m ust also recognize that while confidence appears to be holding against a backd rop of rising unem ployment and in th e face of high household indebtedn ess, consum ers m ay be reluctant to spend accord ing to any pre -existing m odel. Finally, in addition to the un certainties inherent in our  own evolving situation, we should be mindful that our trading partners m ight also be headed for a period of subpar growth.  Just as with the dom estic forecast, weaker-than- expected inco ming data in m any countries hav e forced som e marking down of fo reign growth prospects.  Slower  growth abroad in combination with a strong dollar is likely to continue to lim it export oppo rtunities.  Therefore, in my judgm ent, the risks rem ain distinctly to the downside. 6/26-27/01 122Against this backdrop of a very slow econom y, I believe that inflati on is unlikely to be an im portant f actor in the  near to inte rmediate te rm, and that does give us som e policy flexibility.  While we have been aggressive in our actions to date, I think our challenge  is to decide how to respond at this point. And given the ongoing weakness, I believe that  we are likely to find that our work has not yet been com pleted.  As I said at our last m eeting, our goal is not to try to speed up an investm ent accelerator, which policy cann ot do.  Nor should our go al be to stop a redressing of i mbalances, which policy should not do.  Our goal, I think, should be to cushion the household sector and interest-sensi tive sectors as m uch as possible in order to give businesses a chance to w ork through their inventories and to return to a period of growth in investm ent spending. Should the bond m arket optim ists, as G overnor Gram lich has described them , turn out to be prescient, then we m ay have to retrace ou r steps very q uickly ; and we should be aware of that as a possibility. But for today, at least, I think a bit m ore easing does seem  to be the better course.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  The condition of our economy has been thoroughly exam ined by the other Committee m embers.  There' s little I can add to their comments, and in the ne xt segm ent of  the m eeting we will de cide what a ll this im plies  for policy.  So let m e take a m inute of the Comm ittee' s tim e to comm ent on a concern that I believe bears on our policy strategy going forward. I think it' s important in today' s situa tion to  be m indful of the distinction between the level of econom ic activity and the momentum  in its rate of change.  Momentum  has been lost, but the econom y continues to operate at a very high level.  To be sure, our m easure of capacity utilization is at a near-recession level, unem ploym ent is rising, a nd m anufacturing is very weak.  6/26-27/01 123 However, the volatile light vehicl e and hom ebuilding industries are holding near their very strong recen t highs.   Personal consum ption expenditu res continue to rise, albeit mo re slowly .  And while we have seen sm all net job losses in the past se veral m onths, they are bu t a sm all fraction of  the very strong gains m ade over the p ast several year s, and m ost of those people are still at work.  While unemploym ent is rising from  its recent hist orica lly low level, ther e is a very goo d chance that it will not rise above what  many would consider to be the long-run N AIRU, i mplying that the labor force would still be quite fully utilized when this cycle bottom s out.  The stock m arket, despite a vicious shakeout in som e of its  segm ents, rem ains quite elevated overall. In sum , one hopes that this is the worst econom y we’ll ever expe rience.  And it would not be so ter rible if  it we re jus t to res t here for a while.  But it will no t do that, which r aises the question of mom entum .  The power ful upward thrust of the econom y broke in the third quarter of last y ear wh en GDP growth cam e in at 2.2 percen t and it has been slidi ng downhill ev er since.  That quarter followed a year--from  the third quarter of 1999 through the second quarter of 2000-­when growth was 6.1 percent. The decom pression of this decline has been painful and frightening. Without having done any research to verify it, I suspect that this fall has been about as steep as that which occurs in  a sub stantial recession.  Yet GDP is n't falling ; it jus t isn't rising.  Mom entum  is our prob lem, not the level of ac tivity.  Will the econom y regain m omentum ? Its ongoing strength, bolstered am ong ot her things by Fe d easing, the tax cut, and the conclusion of the inventory correction, m akes r ecovery the m ost lik ely be t.  But f ragile conf idence, f ragile financial m arkets, s talled capital expe nditur es, and many other threats could readily kick us into a new further and possibly severe dow n cycle.  So far the expected upturn is not in clear view and this ongoing weakness must be appropri ately addressed in the near term . 6/26-27/01 124As for myself, I remain confident that we  will successfully deal with the loss of momentum.  But I worry that if we  are too successful in doing so, we could quickly rotate into an overheating problem initiated by th e high level of activity from which the regained momentum arose. That would be most unfortu nate, in my view, if it were to occur.  In the past 2-3/4 years we have been through one major tightening and two major easing cycles, totaling some 500 basis points in policy moves, disregar ding sign.  While there were good and sufficient reasons for all this, in my view that is more than a desirable amount of policy volatility over so short a period of time.  I am convinced that the economy does be st in an era of small and infrequent policy changes, just as it does best with low and stable inflation.  I hope the Committee will seek to find ways to dampen this volatility over time.  When policy needs to change, of course, we must change it. But let's work very hard to do much le ss, in the interest of making sure that we do not unduly whipsaw our economy and thereby perhaps i nhibit rather than enhance our efforts to achieve maximum sustainable growth over time. One further cheery word on this subject: To any others who, like m e, worry about overdoing th is eas ing cycle, we m ay as well relax because if we are go ing to sow the seeds of a future inflation, I fear that we' ve probably already done that.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I want to start by identifying three them es that summ arize m y interpretation of the outlook c ontext for today' s policy decision.  First, growth appears to be at or below 1 per cent for the third consecutive quarter  and there are few signs in the incom ing data of an imminent rebound.  This weakness reflects a com bination of a negative wealth effect on consumption, a sh arp retrenchment in high-tech investment, the continued drag 6/26-27/01 125 from  an incomplete process of inventory correc tion, and the sharper-than-expected weakening in foreign econ omic activ ity.  Second, several forces are in train that s hould collectively contribute to a gradual improve ment in the second half a nd a return to near-trend growth by early or m id next year.  These inclu de the cons iderable degree of m onetary easing already in place, the fiscal stim ulus on the way--the checks are literally alm ost in th e mail--and the prospects fo r a period of declining energy prices. In addition, a continued elevated rate of structural produ ctivity growth, m irroring the continued rapid pace of i nnovation and rapid decline in th e relative price of high-tech equipm ent, should rekindle the a ppetite for high-tech investment. Third, th is cyclical ep isode is uniqu e in an  important respect.  In my judgm ent the slowdown in growth began with output above pote ntial.  As a result, if the consensus and Greenbook forecasts are in the ballpark, when gro wth return s to near trend in 2002, the econom y will be ope rating c lose to f ull em ploym ent.  This point is v ery close ly related to Gove rnor Kelley' s discussion that the econom y, though it has lost m omentum , remains at a high level of output. To be sure, there rem ains a high degr ee of uncertainty about both the sustainable unem ployment ra te and the ra te of trend growth, as well as ab out the tim ing and vigor of the prospective strengthening in dem and.  But it seem s to m e that an im portant im plication of the Greenbook forecast is th at the up turn in econom ic growth m ay begin in 2 002 without the usual slack present at the st art of expansions.  Indeed, we may begin 2002 where we usually find ourselves late in an expansion--close to capacity, and at a place where we have to be particularly alert to inflation pressures. Chart 10 used in the staff' s presentation on the outlook yesterday illustrates th is third th eme.  It shows that th e unemploym ent gap was about 2 percentage points early in this expansion. The staff projects the gap to be near zero as we enter 2002. 6/26-27/01 126Now, the first them e evokes a concern about the downside risk rela tive to the baseline and keeps on the table consideration of further easing, at least as an insurance m ove.  On the other hand, the second and third them es are m ore forward-looking and suggest upside risks, specifically the potential for oversho oting.  These them es point to a m ore cautious approach to further easing. Some have dism issed concerns about overs hooting by noting that any risk could be countered by our quickly m oving to tighter pol icy once the econom y shows m ore tangible signs of revival. That logic does not  entirely relax m e for two reasons. First, I suspect that a quick reversal of monetary polic y is a lo t easier when an easing is called f or to partia lly undo an earlier tightening rather than the reverse.   In addition, while our job is to stabilize inflation and output, not interes t rates, there is  som e value in a voiding a pattern of excessi vely sharp m ovements up and down in interest rates. Let m e comm ent now on how the excellent staff analysis of th e capital overhang, in my view, fits into the story. It seem s to m e that the capital ov erhang sto ry contributes to both the first and second them es--the prevailing weakness  and the prom ise of a rebound.  The m ain source of the overh ang, accord ing to the staff, is a reas sessm ent of the profitab ility of produ cing high -tech cap ital.  This lowere d the ta rget r elative to  the actual cap ital s tock, potentially resulting in a capital overhang. The paper suggests, however, that  a rapid response of investm ent and hence of the actual capital stock to the dec line in its target value has helped  to prevent a serious overhang.  The story does not dim inish the im portance of th e retrenchm ent in high-tech investm ent in the current period of econom ic weakne ss.  A sharp dec line in investm ent that has prevented a m ore serious overhang and the effects of the m odest ove rhang that nevertheless ha ve resulted appear to be im portant sources of the prevailin g weakness in dem and.  But the analysis does su ggest th at 6/26-27/01 127 any capital overhang is likely to be m odest a nd short-lived and, therefor e, unlikely to be an obstacle to the projected strengthening of  the econom y in the Greenbook forecast. From  the productivity papers, I took two conc lusions that help shape the f orecast.  First, bo th the Board sta ff and the Boston Fed be lieve that str uctura l prod uctiv ity gro wth will remain elev ated relative to the exp erience from  the early ’70s to the m id-’90s.  This contributes to confidence in a rebound of high-tech inve stment next year.  Second, and perhaps more controversial, the Board staff believes that structural productivity growth m ay now ha ve structural productivity might be just  a sm all wrinkle in the outlook.  However, it appears that this the deceleration. The effects of accelerations a nd deceleration s in productivity are, I w ould expect, sym metrical.  All the good n ews that co mes with an acceleration turns in to bad news during a deceleration. So whether or not ther e has been overshooting, and if so by how m uch, would have an im portant influence on dem and, e quity prices, and inflation.  In addition, the effect of a possible d eceleration of structural produc tivity growth on the equilibrium  real rate highligh ts one of the ch alleng es perhaps faced by monetary policy in the recen t slow down.  If there h as been a deceleration in structural productivity grow th, monetary policy has had to ease enough to lo wer the real funds rate relative to the declin ing eq uilibrium  rate.  The aggressive easing has achieved this. But if the econom y mo ves to full employm ent and trend growth in 2002 as projected in the consensus and Greenbook forecasts,  the challeng e to m onetary policy soon will be to return to neut rality.  The extended Bluebook sim ulations confirm  this view.   Two considerations significantly enhance th e prospects of m aintaining inf lation under control as we m ove towa rd neutrality: the proj ected decline in  energy pr ices and the s till-low 6/26-27/01 128 capacity utilization rate projected to 2002.  Still, how we se t policy over coming months will also be important in determining just how big a challenge the return to neutrality will be and what the inflation rate will be when we get there. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Th at completes the Committee discussion and I turn to Don Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the charts in the “Longer-Term Strategies” sect ion of the Bluebook.  In the current circumstances, the question of what  the Committee should do today may seem more tightly linked than usual to some of the issues discussed in that section. The Committee has eased substa ntially in a relatively short period of time, leaving the stance of polic y by some measures at its most accommodative since the early 1990s, when the unemployment rate was much higher. And financial market participants believe your most likely policy going forward will entail further re ductions in interest rates followed not long after by a reversal of a substantial portion of your easing--not a common pattern of market expectations for policy.      The baseline simulation, shown on chart 4 following page 6, highlights several important implications of the st aff forecast for policy strategy.  First, given the staff’s assessment of the lo nger-run attributes of the economy, the stance of policy is now accommodative, in the se nse that if the real and nominal federal funds rates are held indefinitely at current levels the economy will eventually produce beyond its po tential and inflation will rise.  As a consequence, altho ugh there is slack in the economy at the end of the Greenbook forecast horizon, it would disa ppear quickly, and policy would have to be tightened at some point, on the order of  1-1/2 percentage points, to avoid having prices accelerate. Th e temporary forces restraining demand in the near term, though, are so strong and persistent that the tightening can be delayed for some time without resu lting in inflation rising from recent levels.      As you can see from chart 5 af ter page 7, the properties of the economy embedded in the staff forecast and model are such that, to hold PCE inflation around its recent rates, a path similar in  contour to the baseline is delivered both by simple policy rules, such as the Taylor rule plotted in blue, and by a more complicated process, such as wh at we have dubbed “perfect foresight,” shown by the dotted red line. That latter policy is c onstructed on the assumption that the policymaker has full information about prospective economic tendencies, as given in th e Greenbook and its extension, and full knowledge of the dynamics of the econom y.  Given the current forecast, the policymaker responds actively and fo rcefully to near-term economic 6/26-27/01 129 weakness, even in the knowledge that th e funds rate is being reduced to well below equilibrium  values and will n eed to be r aised substan tially in the future. In the context of this sim ulation, lowering and then raising that rate in a short period isn’t “o vershooting.”  It’s a ra tional response to the circum stances--a respon se that take s full account of the forecast and, on the assum ption that the forecast em bodies  a correct evaluation of the econom y, will work better than o ther policies to stabilize econom ic activity while keeping inflation low. This policy bo th rationalizes the prompt action we have already seen and produces a subs tantial reversal beginning next year, although nowhere near as pronounced as currently anticipated in financial      Of course, these implications ar e sensitive to a number of judgments that form the basis for the staff forecast.  Charts 6 and 7 focus on a key judgment related to your discussion yesterday- -the rate of growth of structural productivity. Chart 6, following page 8, examines the consequences of a prompt return to the rate of structur al productivity growth of the last few years--in effect assuming that the recent slowdown is quite temporary.  Interestingly, such an assumption produces results for interest rates that look closer to those embedded in financial markets than does the staff forecast, particularly so with the “perfect foresight” policy.  With aggregate demand boosted by the more rapid expansion of earnings and income, the rise in interest rates needs to begin sooner and to  be larger than in  the baseline to avoid longer-run inflationary instabil ities, even though inflation would be restrained in the short term by better-b ehaved unit labor costs than in the baseline.      In the experiment run for chart 7, structural producti vity growth falls another 3/4 percentage point, leading to growth in potential output at a rate only modestly above its average of the 1970s and ’80s.  This  is the reverse of the experience of the late 1990s and is accompanied not only by slower growth, but also by a much more unfavor able short-run relationship between the unemployment rate and inflation.  The Taylor rule and the perfect foresight policies, putti ng some weight on both output and inflation stabilization, allow unemployment to  run above its long-run NAIRU and inflation above its implicit target.  Ju st as real and nominal federal funds rates had to rise in the higher produc tivity growth scenario, with lower productivity growth they have to fall to achieve a short-run balance between these adverse outcomes.      As these sim ulations illus trate, your decis ion about the fun ds rate today will depend on your assessm ents of t he underly ing trends in the econom y, the extent of the shocks causing the econom y to deviate from those trends, and the strength of the countervailing force of expansionary m onetary and fiscal policies. 6/26-27/01 130     Suppose you see underlying produc tivity trends as lik ely to be quite strong but n ot accelerating and the u nemployment rate therefore as needing to rise appreciably to get to a m ore su stainable level.  If in addition you see the restraining effects of inventory, capital stock, and household saving rate adjustm ents as leveling out soon and beginning to dissipate on balance before long and you view policy as already sufficiently acco mmodative to counteract the effects of these rest raints on dem and, you m ight want to consider holding the stance of policy st eady at this m eeting.  In the staff’s forecast, at the presen t federal funds rate, th e econ omic adjustm ents in train result in a rise in th e une mploym ent rate  that n eutralizes the intensif ying cost pressures in herent in the cessation of  productivity acceleratio n.  Core PCE inflation is capped, though at a level in  2002 that is a bit above its average from  1997 through 2000.  With expected in flation perhaps already near the upper bound of what m any m embers m ight consider acceptable, and policy needing to be tightened at som e point  to keep it from  rising further, the Comm ittee m ight see addition al easing as tipp ing the balanc e away f rom risks of near-term  weakness toward l onger-term  inflation.  Concerns on this score m ight be accen tuated if the Committee felt that reversin g policy direction in an environm ent of m oderate growth and higher unem ploym ent rates would not turn out to be nearly as  frictionle ss as in the s tatistical rules and m odels.      However, keeping policy unchanged  would seem  to require a degree of confidence that interest rates are lo w enough to foster an adequate rebound in econom ic growth before very long, or at least that the risks around such an outcom e are reasonably balanced.  In that regard, the exp erience of the recen t interm eeting period of disappointing d ata on dem and and downward revisions to forecasts m ay suggest th at the risk s to these forecasts are still substantially weighted to  the downside.  Soft econom ic data and reductions in expected corporate earnings also have eroded the m arket optim ism that seem ed to be taking hold over the prev ious interm eeting period, resulting in expectations and their effects on asset pr ices have not been confined to the United States, raising the possibility that a weakening global outlook will impinge on U.S. exports, especially with  dollar strength persisting.  Against this background, the considerable surpri se that w ould result in m arkets were the Comm ittee to leave policy unchanged could have quite a negative effect on attitudes and asset prices, dam ping the rebound in economic activity.      The revisions in econom ic forecasts and m arket expectations m ay imply that, in effect, policy is not as stim ulative or the f orces restraining spending are som ewhat stronger than you--and financial m arket participants--had anticipated at your last m eeting.  The gap between the actu al real federal funds rate and the rang e of equilibri um real rates shown in the Bluebook policy. For one, if the NAIRU is lower than em bedded in th e staff forecast, 6/26-27/01 131the equilib rium  rate will also be lo wer, and the ec onom y will be able to accomm odate a strong er rebound to a high level o f production  without generating inflation. In the staff m odel, the effects of alternative NAIRU assum ptions are not trivial--about 1/ 2 percentage point on r* for every percentage point on NAIRU. For anothe r, the federal funds rate in this exercise serves as a proxy for a broad ar ray of interest rates and asset prices along the transmission channels.  In f act, in this episode the dollar has firmed and stock prices have declined a ppreciably since last fall.  With some of the traditional financial transmission channels blocked, the real funds rate      In addition, m any bond rates, while  dropping substantially last fall in anticipation of policy easing, have rise n slightly on balance since late to require a firm ing of policy next y ear.  While you m ay wa nt to give som e weight in yo ur decis ion to the possib ility that thes e expectatio ns are co rrect, the potential for a backup in bond yields  should you ease does not im ply that reducing the federal funds rate would be ineffective or counter-productive and should not deter you from  taking an action you otherwise thought necessary. For one, a failure to ea se would probably produce substantial conditions considerably. In addition, were the econom y to turn out to be much less ro bust than m arket pa rticip ants seem  to expect, lon g-term  rates would ultim ately adjus t to the eas ier stance of  policy.  In these circum stances, waiting u ntil econom ic weakness showed thro ugh into low er long-term  rates and created apparently more receptive m arket conditions for policy ease would only accentu ate the econom ic weakness y our easing would be designed to address.      If you thought that resource utiliz ation was likely to be on a considerably lower track than needed to contain inflation, you m ight consider a 50 basis point reduction in the target federal f unds rate at this m eeting.  Such a judgm ent m ight follow from  perceptions of downside risks to the staff forecast of d emand, arising for example fr om the possibility of a substantial might follow from  a sense that the st aff has underestim ated the contribution of added flexibility in labor m arkets to reducing the long-run NAIRU and containing cost pressure. A 50 basis point reduction would be a little m ore than is now incorporated in financial market prices.  The best bet is that equity prices would rise, but the reaction of long-term  interest  rates is harder to predict. Even if they should increase, the net effect on financial conditions of your action is likely to be stim ulative. Any rise in real long-term rates w ould probably be a response to an outsized gain in equity prices.  If the econo my turned o ut as weak and price p ressures as da mped as the expectations that led th e Comm ittee to choose this option, any increase in 6/26-27/01 132 long-term  nom inal rates from  higher in flation expectations should be short-lived.       If, however, you thought that after your previous acti ons this year the risks on economic growth and infla tion were not so one-sided and you suspected that policy was already cl ose to sufficiently accommodative to foster an adequate pickup in growt h, a 25 basis point easing would be more appropriate. In light of the uncerta inties, such an ac tion would give you greater assurance that financial conditi ons were supportive of a satisfactory strengthening in demand late this ye ar and early 2002.  Even if you thought more easing might well be needed at so me point, with real interest rates already relatively low, the Committee might see substantial gains from shifting to a more gradual pace to allo w more time to calibrate policy to the emerging effects of earlier monetary a nd fiscal actions, as well as the evolution of demands for capital goods and pressures on costs and prices.  A 25 basis point easing would be less th an the markets are anticipating.  movements would be limited to the exte nt that market participants did not see you making major shifts in your reactions and intentions, but only changing the trajectory of  easing and becoming a bit more cautious.  If the action and its accompanying announcement, however, is seen as signaling your intent to end the easing cycle at this time and to respond considerably less forcefully to unexpected economic w eakness in the future, the decline in asset prices could be substantial.      Whatever your policy choice for th e federal funds rate , market reactions will be affected also by your choice of balance of risks language in the announcement.  At your last meeting, several of you remarked that this meeting might be time to consider shifti ng that language to indicate the risks were balanced. In the Bluebook, however, we assumed that you would retain language indicating that the ba lance of risks was weighted toward economic weakness.  With incoming information still quite soft and suggesting that economic growth stalled in recent months, and with forecasts inside and outside the Federal Reserv e being revised down, the balance of risks seems to us still to be wei ghted in that direction.  In those circumstances, short-term risks of  weakness may still seem to be a potentially more important influence on policy, at least for now, than longer-term concerns about inflation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Questions for Don? 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Don, in term s of the press stat ement that you talked about at the end of your rem arks:  What do you think th e market's reaction would be to a statem ent that noted the downside risks but also indicated that we m ight be finished easing, depending on the data that 6/26-27/01 133 accum ulate over the n ext several weeks?   I don' t want to put words in Bill Poole' s mouth but I’m thinking about his suggestion that we say we’re inclined to wait wi th regard to judgm ents about our future policy course. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think there would be a consid erable reaction for th e following reasons.  points of further ease built in. Assum ing you accompany that statem ent with, say, a 25 basis point cut, they would be taking out that other 25 plus basis poin ts of ease.  And I think they would also see you as tying your hands to a certai n extent--as indeed it w ould be your intent to do--in term s of your response to incom ing data.  You would be sa ying that the data could be weak and you m ight not respond to th at--that you intend to be less active in your responses.  In my view, that would affect not only asset prices, bond yields, and equity prices, but expectations as new data cam e in.  How m arkets will respond to new data o n employm ent and sales and output would be affected because they would see you as responding less to those data.  So I think there would be som e immediate effect as well as a co ntinuing effect over tim e. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. But don' t you think there' s a possi bility that the m essage is that if the incom ing data were weak, we would evaluate th at, especially if we had a balance of risk statem ent weighted to th e downside ?  Isn' t that ju st as likely--or perhaps more likely, I think--to be the real m essage? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. The balance of risk statem ent toward weakness would help take away from  the reaction I described to a certain extent. You' ve raised a com plicated thought in term s of how the Committee m ight want to try to nuance its posture to the m arkets.  To m ake the m arkets understand that you are changing your  posture is going to be very, very difficult to convey in the press statem ent, particularly one that we' ve attempted to shorten this tim e in response to the 6/26-27/01 134 Comm ittee’ s reques t last time.  This is som ething that perhaps the Chairm an m ight address in his testim ony, but I think it would be very hard to  do in today’s announcem ent.  I believe the immediate m arket reaction would be fairly s trong to a statem ent that rath er explicitly indica tes that you thought you’ve done all the easing you needed to do. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. I have two questions, Don. But first let m e follow up on the exchange between you and Tom  Hoenig.  At som e point we have to back up our confidence in the future with action or lack thereof, not just our words. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Right. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. The Bl uebook does a rem arkable job of putting together a lot of options for us to consider depending on the assu mptions we want to m ake.  I know you can' t put in 17 alternatives to satis fy all 17 of us, but you are getting clos e.  If I want to be a productivity optim ist as in Chart 6, then, of course, I take seri ously the kind of caution th at suggests.  That by itself, on the  basis of  partial analy sis at le ast, s ays that we m ight have to  consider going in the other direction sooner and by m ore than under othe r assum ptions.  But I also believe that the labor m arkets have been influenced in a funda mental way by a sustained low inflation environm ent and by a pickup in pr oductivity in technology. So if I also want to be a long-run NAIRU optim ist and believe th at the downward move in the natura l rate is perm anent and not just transient, do those two offset? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Well, yes, though it depends on how m uch you would lower the natural rate. They wouldn' t offset en tirely.  If I m ay, I’d like to am end m y remarks to President Broaddus yesterday, when I said th at the tradeoff m ight be a little m ore than one-for-one.  In checking with the m odeling folks this m orning, they  said it w as about one-for-one in term s of a  6/26-27/01 135 percentage point of productivity growth and a percentage point on r* over a longer term--five to ten years--from where r* is now.  So it depends on how you mix and match this.  And, as I just noted, in terms of the NAIRU it's about one-h alf point for one point.  The long-run NAIRU embedded in these forecasts is 5-1/2 percent. So if you thought the NAIRU was 5 percent, you could take 1/4 point off the equili brium real rate, and th at would offset to a certain extent the 3/4 point increase that we have in  productivity growth.  But you woul d have to have a rather low NAIRU--I haven’t done the exact arithmetic, but a NAI RU of about 4 percent, I guess--to offset entirely the effects of th e higher productivity growth. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. My other question relates to the fact that I sh are th e concerns Bill Poole cited about growth in the various m oney a nd credit aggregates being extraordinarily rapid.  And, of course, history suggests--w hether it' s relevant to the futu re or not--that to ignore m oney growth is at our peril. Are you com fortabl e in looking at and understanding those m oney numbers in a way that s ays they are not a risk? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. The m oney and credit aggreg ates tell m e that we are not f acing blockages in the financial m arkets.  As Presid ent Poole noted , credit is freely availab le to creditworthy corporations. Now the spread s, certainly on junk bonds and on m arginally investm ent-grade credits, are very, very high by historical standards.   So m oney is available, but it's costly.  The cost of capital has b een raised for those borrowers, but the m oney is there.  And I think the Committee' s easing this year has certainly facilita ted a restruc turing of balance sheets.  The volum e of bond issuance has been huge.  Corporations th at can a ccess the m arkets have been able to strengthen thei r balance sheets, and that' s obviously a positive elem ent going forward. 6/26-27/01 136On the m oney side, m oney growth has been very, very strong.  Some of it we can explain just by the usual responses to  declines in interest rates, th e usual fluctuations in velocity as opportunity costs change. But money growth is m uch stronger th an that.  In our analysis we thought som e special factors were at work, such as m ortgage re financing and a few things like that. In addition, our view is that the volatility and less favorab le perform ance of the equity there has been a shift in the dem and for m oney.  That shift by itself wouldn' t suggest strength going forward; it' s a shift in the demand curve.  But once again, like the credit flows, I think it suggests that there is ample liqui dity out there, so financial co ncerns and liquidity concerns shouldn' t be holding the econom y back.  Whether th ere will be a stim ulus going forward m ore than is indicated by the interest rates, I don’ t know.  I have som e questions about whether demand for money is stable enough to draw that conclusion.  But I think it's supportive; it' s helpf ul for sure.

MR. GUYNN. Don, if I  followed Governor Gram lich's comm ents, he was trying to reconcile the apparent inconsistency between th e expectation in financial m arkets of a very prom pt, quick, and fairly substant ial reversal of policy early next year and the consensus forecast for the econ omy.   

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Right. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. If I interpret Chart 1 following page 1 in  the B luebook correctly, the That expec tation is overlaid with a c onsensus fo recast that g rowth will still be p icking  up--and might not even be at potential--unemploym ent ma y still be increas ing, and inflation, if it com es, 6/26-27/01 137 inflationary pressure out there and that they think we would re spond that preem ptively to that kind of phenom enon? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Whether they' re seein g inflation ary pressure or real pr essure I th ink is a very difficult question. As som e of you have rem arked and as we noted in our briefing yesterday, it’s v ery hard to parse th e recen t rise in rates between inflation  and real rates.  Althoug h the TIPS inflation exp ectations, th ere’s v ery little co rroborating evidence of that .  Governor Gram lich himself noted that there’s no such ev idence in co mmodity prices, surveys, or  in the behavior of the dollar. After all, if  there were an  incre ase in inflation exp ectations, one would think that would not be a favorable environm ent for dollar assets.  That should be causing som e pulling back from  investm ents into the United States. But the continued strength in the dollar--though that’s relative to the really poor perform ance in  other countries perhaps --does suggest that people haven’t lost confidence in the ability of the Fe deral Reserve to keep inflation contained at reasonable levels despite what the T IPS spreads m ight be doing.  So, the m arkets m ay well be expectin g a little m ore inf lation- -a bit m ore than they were anticipating a few months ago when they e xpected it to  declin e--bu t they probably reflect more a sense that activity is goi ng to bounce back and that real ra tes will be rising.  And I think and “forcefully” as you like to say--with a decline in rates.  And, gratifyi ngly, they’ve built in a certain sym metry to that.  Obviously, as a num ber of you remarked, they seem  to have a m ore optim istic view of the situation than econom ists do both inside and outside this building.  But I do believe they expect you to begin to tighten and cut off inflationary im pulses pretty quickly. 6/26-27/01 138

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  Mr. Chairm an, I just have a comment, which is very sim ilar to what Don just said.  Financia l market participants do have a view of this Comm ittee, and it is reflected both in rates and in commentary.  Living in  New York, one sees a lot of these people and talks to them.  They belie ve that this Comm ittee has grea t courage of  its convictions. The degree of credib ility of the Committee is extrem ely hig h.  The m arkets believe that what we’ve been doing so far this year ha s been front-loading an easing of m onetary policy.  And they’re absolutely convinced th at when the time com es to revers e that, we will front-lo ad the correction. I think that’s  very complimentary to the Comm ittee.  I share Governor Kelley ’s view in that I wish we could get out of all this ac tivism, and over tim e I thi nk it would be good if we could. But in m y view what you’re reading in the markets is a com bination of  the f act tha t they’re a little m ore optim istic about the recovery  but very convinced that when the tim e com es to move rates up, we will front-load our actions.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Shall we break for coffee? [Coffee break] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It is clear th at the econom y and ge neral expectations eroded further after the May m eeting, but in the last week or so th ere appears to have been som e move ment away from  the unm itigated weakness th at characterized a good ly part of the new inform ation earlier in the interm eeting period.  For exam ple, the m ost recent data sugg est th at motor vehicle sales were holding up in June, at  least through the firs t half, even though a significan t part of that may reflect General Moto rs’ recen t efforts to g et custom ers to turn in their 6/26-27/01 139 leased vehicles early and buy new cars. Even asid e from  that, it seem s clear  that the auto m arket has been holding up, I think to the surprise of the motor vehicle manufacturers.  We know that home sales are doing reasonably well and consum er confidence, although down sharply, seem s to be stab ilizin g at le ast te mporaril y.  I want to emphasize, however,  that these recent developm ents are not inco nsisten t with  a new wave of econom ic weakness.  They are types of developm ents that are short term  in nature.  We do have the Chicago and Philadelphia purchasing m anagers’ numbers, which suggest that the rate of decline in  manufacturing is slowing.  It is true that there was evidence of that earlier, although our num bers did not show it and indeed they still don' t.  The overall clim ate does  seem  to be a little better after a pe riod in recent weeks when absolutely everything was negative, but ther e is no doubt that the overall picture is still quite w eak. We are observing an im portan t declin e in ener gy prices that I thi nk is going to reduce some of the pressure on profit m argins.  Prices in  the gaso line futures m arket ar e off more than 4 cents per gallon today. Crude is down, depending on which contract one is looking at, som e 75 cents to a do llar per ba rrel.  So we are seeing the dem and for energy beginning to ease in various parts of the econom y, and that is having a saluta ry effect not only on energy prices but it is probably spilling over into infl ation expectations. The yield sp read between nom inal ten-year Treasuries--I should say our syntheti c version of the Treasury yield calculated to obtain the sam e degree of liquidity as in TIPS--and T IPS itself has com e down a good deal recently, and indeed the decline in that sp read has pretty much revers ed the previous rise.  Core PCE as estim ated by the staff for May is unch anged.  The most recen t price trend s are very soft.  There is v ery little in the way of pricing power in the econom y. The m ajor problem  that I think s till exists f or us is essentially the one I m entioned at the last m eeting.  We have seen very dram atic capital losses.  These losses are weighing on the 6/26-27/01 140 system , and as best I can judge the effects have  not fully worked their way through the econom y.  Indeed, they probably have only partially work ed their way through on the dem and side.  The crucial concern in that regard is the fact th at, sitting ri ght on the edge of the third quarter, security analysts have earnings per share estim ates for the S&P 500 that seasonally adjusted reflect a double-digit rise for the third quarter .  That is not at an annual rate .  Now that just doesn' t square with what I have heard f rom a num ber of pe ople whose firm s and earnings num bers are in the S&P 500. This leads m e to question whether the SEC’s financial disclosure requirem ent, which as you know has prohibited the chief financial o fficers from  giving out inf ormation selectively, security analysts. As I have m entioned before, since thes e are not secu rity analys ts in the old sense of the term  who really looked at the com pany and m ade their own judgm ents rather than relying on com pany reports, it m ay be that we are getting som e short-circui ting here.  It's going to be very interesting to watch developm ents over the next several weeks if we get som e very dram atic declines in earnings expectations or, to  put it m ore exactly, when we get very dram atic downward revisions in the security analysts’ estim ates.  I’m not su re at this stag e whether that will have a m arket or econom ic effect, largely b ecause it' s hard to know what im pact this SEC rule is having on the system . The problem that we have is not that the economy is going to be a shad e weaker or a shade strong er than the Greenbook forecast.  That's not what any policy in this regard  should be or is all abo ut.  It's basically the is sue that I raised at the las t meeting.  There is a low probability, I would say 10 to 20 percent or m aybe less, that we m ay get a significantly weaker outcom e than the Greenbo ok forecast.  Mike Kelley points ou t that  economic activity is stil l at a hig h level and that the glass is half full. In the other half of  the glass there is potenti ally a very long drop on the 6/26-27/01 141 downside, especially in the capital go ods area.   Remember, orders and shipm ents of capital equipm ent are just back to where th ey were in  early 1999, when the reaction was euphoric.  They are well abo ve where they were, say, five years ago.  And if the current econom ic weakness feeds on itself, the cutback in capital spend ing could proceed a long way on the downside.  I think th e probability of that outco me is actually less th an it was in Janu ary.  If we look back at what was happening then, we see that the expansion was weakening very qui ckly.  The Greenbook forecast has the econom y as a whole stabilizing.  That pr obability m ay have gone down som e, but it' s still out there. As best I can judge in any event,  it's still a fairly significant probability. As Bill Poole m entioned in a slightly  different co ntext, we a re in a typ e of business cycle that w e have not seen before, and it m ight be useful to think of it in term s of its unusual characteristics. In 1999 and early 2000 we expe rienced a plain old-fashioned investment boom , the likes of which we had not observed for a ve ry long tim e.  What we are seeing now is an econom y that is com ing off that boom, hopefully  in a m anner that will gradually lead to stabiliz ation .  My best ju dgment is th at busin ess investm ent will com e down in tranch es.  That is, it may drop, stabilize, and fall furthe r at a later date but not by as much.  The basic issue here is that we don' t in fact kno w what the distribution of probabilities is, and I think that we face a degree of risk that we are not able to assess fu lly.  If the data continue to show signs of stabilization , then I think  the Greenb ook forecast is  the m ost likely ou tcome.  Indeed, I actu ally think th at it has th e highest probability.  As I noted, I  believ e that discuss ions of whether GDP will be  marginally higher or lower are beside the point. I do think that if the econom y begins to stabilize, the current funds rate could be too low. I don' t think that is the case, but that' s certa inly a credible view.  The fact that we are below our estim ate of the equilibriu m rate is exactly where we ought to be in m y 6/26-27/01 142 view. We ought to be below it.  The issue is not wh ether we want to be at an equilibrium  rate in a context such as this. I think the answer is “no.” But the pr oblem  of havi ng had this big surge in capital inv estment raises the que stion of whether we can m aintain, as Mike Kelley I think quite appropriately observed, a m ore stable regim e with respect to the funds rate  as indeed was the case in much of t he period from  early 19 96 until the early  fall of 1998.  If we believ e that monetary policy can stabilize the econom y when confronted with the types of forces we are seeing, the implication is a highly volatile federal funds ra te that m oves against those forces on the upside and in the other direction on the downside. It may very well be that before this economy stabilizes we will get a pickup next  year and in that cas e I th ink we will h ave to raise the funds rate. I don' t think there' s anything wrong with moving the funds rate up provided we' re dealing with an econom y that has not st abilized.  When we  were deal ing with econom ic conditions in 1996 and 1997, for example, and we were keeping th e funds rate rem arkably stable, I thought at that tim e that we had found the right equilibr ium because there was no seem ing tendency for anything to veer off. The probl em as we learned is that the longer we m aintain a degree of stability, the lower the risk prem iums becom e.  So there is a question of whether we have an internal problem  in policym aking, nam ely that if we indeed stabilize the system  for too long, risk prem iums fall, speculatio n tends to em erge, and we face the type of problem  that we ran into.  That m ay be, and I suspect it is an inevitable c onsequence of any for m of discre tionary monetary policy. Unless we go back to the gold standard or adopt som e autom atic m echanis m, or conduct a black box type of m onetary policy, I don' t see how we can get around this problem .  I would prefer that we keep the f unds rate  stable as long as we can, but th ere are risks.  So I don' t think that m oving the rate up and down in and of itself is neces sarily bad. 6/26-27/01 143I had hoped at the last meeting that we could hold at a 4 pe rcent funds rate if the May Greenbook forecast held.   In the ev ent, the forecast wa s not o n target; thin gs began to deteriorate.  Specifically, with inflation expectations if anythi ng falling at this point, I think we can afford to reduce the rate ano ther 25 basis points.  I would  hope  that w ill be the en d of it.  And indeed it should be th e end of it if  the Greenb ook forecast were to m aterialize as w e have been hoping.  The reasons why econom ic conditio ns should stab ilize have been articu lated around the room , and I agree fully with them. I think that 's the correct way to look at this econom y. The chances of the econ omy accelerating ve ry fast, m ore so than in the G reenbook forecast, are very low in my view. I think su ch acceleration would requ ire capital good s markets to turn and move up relatively qui ckly.  I thought the anecdotal di scussions relating to the capital overhang presentation yesterday were very useful and informative.  As I indicated yesterday, I didn' t find the econom etrics very persuasive.  Indee d, it seemed to m e, especially with regard to the non-high-tech area, that if  the target capital stock was calculated that way, som ebody put wrong data into the equation. It doesn' t work th at way.  And as I indicat ed, unless we m ake the calcu lation in a rate-of-return con text, I'm  not sure we can readily es timate, at least econom etrically, what the optim um capital stock is.  I believe it is quite con ceivable that we have a much larger overhang here th an the business comm unity knows. The point is that there are very great uncertainties out there. I would say that it' s too soon at this stage to change th e balance of risks statem ent largely for reasons that Don Kohn e laborated up on, I though t eloquen tly, because of the risks that the econom y could get awfully weak.  I have no way of knowing this, but we m ay end up with a very sign ificant inc rease in the unem ploym ent rate  for June when it com es out next week.  We 6/26-27/01 144 troubling than the one w e have been through.  I think that is a low probabili ty event, but it is by no m eans a zero probability.  What I would like to put on the table is a 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate, and if we were to do that I would expect the Federal Reserve Board to follow with a sim ilar reduction in the discount rate. I would retain the statem ent of risks toward expectations of further weakness. If we m ove 25 basis poin ts we will sig nal to the market that w e are now in  the proc ess of com pleting our easing actions.  If we then do nothing at the next m eeting, I don' t think we would have a particular m arket reaction.  At so me point we will have to  stop eas ing.  What is going to happen as far as I can se e is that if  these laten t data or signals we’re getting that the econom y is stabilizing actually materialize, the federal funds futures m arket will adjust autom atically.  In other words, we can go into th e next m eeting with the expectation of no change in the m arket.  That fran kly is m y best estim ate of what is lik ely to happ en.  Forecasting in periods like this is a very high-ri sk undertaking anyway.  I do thi nk, as was suggested at the last meeting, that if we m ove the rate down 25 basi s points, we ought to indicate in our press statem ent that we have reduced the rate by 275 ba sis points since the beginning of the year.  That will sign al that we think  we’re at the end of our easing action s or clos e to it.  I don' t deny that the 50 basis points today it would put us  in a position where we would not be able to sta bilize th is side of a 2 percent funds rate. As I see it, that gets a little scar y frankly.  Anywa y, 25 basis points is my recomm endation.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  Mr. Chairm an, to syn opsize what you just said:  We would ease by 25 basis points and we would have  a balan ce of risks s tatem ent that indicates continuing concern about econom ic weakness.  I completely agree with that conclusion.  And I 6/26-27/01 145 share the hope, probably best described as a fond hope, that by the next m eeting we can issue a statem ent that the risk s have evened out.

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I, too, agree with your propos al.  This is exactly what I had hoped would com e out of this m eeting.  In my view a move of 25 basis points, as you have noted, is a signal. To m e it also in dicates a m easure of confidence on the part of  the Comm ittee that the central tend ency of forecasts--t hat is, a bounceback by year-end a nd into early n ext year--is something with which we had some level of agr eement.  There was a lot of discussion about econom ic forecasts and the financia l market’s forecast, bu t I think what th e markets are telling us is that they expect us to be forward-looking.  And in that rega rd, as you m entioned, we could well see data in the near future that are weaker th an they have been, though perhaps not weaker than we expected in our forecast. We just have to li ve with that and have som e level of confidence that the forces we think will fo ster a pickup by th e end of the y ear actually will operate.  So I think this is exactly the right m ove.

You m entioned that it would be desirabl e to indica te in the statem ent som ething about the am ount of easing to da te.

I would point out that if  we were f ollowin g a hard- line monetaris t regim e and the dem and either for m oney or for goods were bouncing around, the funds rate would t oo.  That doesn' t mean that funds rate volatility is desirab le but I th ink as y ou said, Mr. Chairm an, som etimes that is n ecess ary when conditions change a lot. Also, I would note that if we follo w your recom mendation, it would be very close to what the Bluebook la bels the “perfect foresight po licy.”  And how can we get any bette r than that! 6/26-27/01 147

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I guess the best way for m e to put it is that I do not disagree strongly with your recommendation.  I am  concerned that we’re m aking a little too m uch of the incom ing short-run data on the econom y.  Early in the year, as you know, there was a debate about whether the econom y was going to follow a “V” shaped versus a “U” shaped pattern of reacceleration.   I think what we' ve learn ed is th at the “U” shaped  proponents have turned out to be correct, at least so far.  And if we are hone st, we have to adm it that we don' t know how long the bottom  of that “U” is going to last.  As I said at the last m eeting, som e patience is going to be called for along the way he re, esp ecially because th e logic of our policy is that we' ve been easing fairly aggressively because  we think it m atters.  So we' ve got to give it some chance to see whether in fact that' s going to work or not.  Thank you.

I do have two m ajor concerns and they are on both sides of  this issue.  One is that I, too, am  concerned, as you are, that there m ay be a second phase to this down cycle.  I think it is a  low probability bu t in m y view this  action g ives u s som e flexibility and ke eps our options open going forward. My second concern rela tes to the long-term i mpact on inflation and inflation expectations. And I think this is a som ewhat highe r probability.  In light of the discussion we had, as you said, we must be willing to m ove rates up when appropriate, when this downturn stabilizes. As som eone sa id in our di scussion--I forget who it was--the m arkets are expecting us to m ove promptly a nd forcibly when that tim e com es. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Poole. 6/26-27/01 148

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I do not suppor t the recomm endation because I believe that the bala nce of risks statem ent will be read by  the m arket as a forecas t of m ore ease to com e.  As I read the balance of risks la nguage, I think it is co rrect that over the next m onth or two the balance of risks is genuinely weighted towa rd econom ic weakness and higher unem ploym ent.  But the relevant policy horizon is more 6 to 12 months out and over that horizon I believe that the risks are truly evenly balanced. In my view th at's the right sort of policy horizon.  If the incom ing data are weak, and that' s not my forecast but I certainly don' t rule it ou t--non e of us can rule that ou t--I think there' s ample room  for the m arkets to bring long -term rates down.  As I noted, thos e rates h ave not com e down since Decem ber.  Looking at lon g-term  rates,  if it appears that the econom y is m uch weaker than we now see, long-term  rates easily would have room  to come down 100 or 150 basis points with the funds rate where it is.  I'm concerned that we are building in a problem  for the future by indicating to the m arkets, in accord ance with m y view of how the m arket will read  our press statem ent, that there is m ore eas e to co me.  This is an empirical judgm ent.  It's not a m atter of logic.  It's my judgment or forecast of how the m arket is going to r eact to the statem ent.  I suspect th at the market will have another 25 basis point decline bid into the Septem ber futures, and that' s a testab le proposition.  In fact we 're going to test it very soon, I suspect. On the issue of inflation expectations, I th ink it is im portant to understand--it' s very fortunate, of  course--that inflati on expectations are holding steady.  That' s a vote of confidence in the Comm ittee.  It is not a reading on whether we have policy tuned corr ectly.  It's a vote of confidence that we will do what is n ecessa ry to create tha t outcom e--stable inflation--in the future. And I’m  concerned, taking account of th e lags that are inhere nt in these m onetary processes, that policy is on an excessively expansionary course. 6/26-27/01 149

With respect to the issue that Pr eside nt Stern raised, when incom ing data are weaker than we expect--particularly when the econo my is as weak as  this one is or is growing as slowly as this one is--I think it' s not unreasonable to  react to th em.  If the data cam e in exactly as w e expected, I don't think that would call for react ion.  What has happened is that they have been weaker.  And if the economy continues to weaken, we m ay find ourselves having to act again.  With respect to the langu age, I happen to  believ e that over the fore seeab le future the b alance of risks is toward econom ic weakness, and our language reflects that.

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, if I had m y preference, I would have stopped the easing process by now. I would not go the quart er point.  But, given your recomm endat ion, including the third part of your  recommendation on signaling that we are m ost likely done, as I understand it, unless there is sign ificant new inform ation, I can accept you r recomm endation.  I 6/26-27/01 150 would add that I would like to see more of an explanation in our press statem ent, but since I argued last tim e for a shorter statement, I will not push that point here today.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairm an, I support the r ecommendation.  I wish I could be m ore comfortable with the balance of ri sks statem ent.  I hesitate to re open th at issue even a crack.  I hope that th e signaling effects of your statem ent will work.  I find m yself a good bit in  Bill Poole' s camp in having the sense that the m arket and m any of us perhaps are reading the tim e dimension in the statem ent as a very short-term  horizon.  And if m arket part icipants translate that into th e view that m ore weak data w ill mean m ore cuts in the funds ra te until the data turn around, I don' t think that' s the outco me we’re looking for.  I think we are going to have to com e back at som e point and talk about the tim e dim ension of the balance of risks statem ent.  But for the m oment I support your recomm endation and I hope it has the effect that you think it will.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  A year ago at this tim e when we cam e into the m eeting we had the hope from the prior m eeting that we would not need to m ove again.  We had m ade a 50 basis point increase in May la st year and by the tim e of our June meeting people expected that we would move the rate up more.  We hoped that we wouldn' t have to do that when we cam e to that m eeting.  The outside pressures and expectations on us were that we were going to do considerably m ore tightening, a nd we disappointed thos e expectations.  So, I was hoping for a repeat--a m irror im age of that--in that after the May action our approach would be symm etrical to the on e we followed las t year  and we wouldn’t have to  move again at this meeting.  But m aybe the risks are not symm etrical  or the econom y; I don' t know.  I do agree that we have to be as vigilant to lean against boom s as we do the su bsequent inevitable busts.  When 6/26-27/01 151 we discuss the balance o f risks for th e press stat ement, we make som e remarks that can have no possible bearing on a statem ent that' s already been drafted.  Nevertheless, the risks that we see on the downside are fairly narrow and we have to wo rry about the risks spread ing.  Not all sectors, industries, and regions of this economy are in fact showing weakne ss; som e are showing remarkable robustness.  And I think we have to tr y to be a little clearer in the statem ents that some of us m ake--perhaps you can do so in your testim ony, Mr. Chairm an--that what we have seen, as you and Bill Poo le have s aid, is fairly uni que.  There is no weakness in the auto sector o r the housing sector--areas that have been asso ciated in the past w ith a weak econom y and recess ions.  Therefore, o ur ability  to respond to this type of w eakness an d the risks involved is different. Moreover, we are not th e only gam e in town.  We do have fiscal stim ulus and we do have declining energy prices. So ther e is a lot of easing in the pipeline. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I agree with reducing the fed funds target  by 25 basis points and with putting the bias toward econom ic we akness because I think that' s where it is.  I do think, though, that having to vote on the risk statement and then announcing it is not serving us well.  I think it' s making our decisionm aking process much m ore com plicated.  So, I would hope  that sooner rather than later w e might consider not voting on a bias .  If we just lim it our vote to the funds rate stop announcing it while we continue  to vote on it.  But if at som e point you could just say that this is not w orking as well as we had hoped and henceforth w e are not going to have a for mal vote on a bias, I think that would serve us well.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 6/26-27/01 152

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I believe that we m ay be at an important inf lection point for m onetary policy. It's important today, in m y view, that we  at le ast de celerate the pace of easing and signal that the cons iderab le deg ree of m onetary easing in train is likely to  contribute to im provem ent in the pace of econom ic activity.  Mr. C hairman, I believ e your recomm endat ion for a 25 basis poin t easing and a statem ent of unbalanced risks m oves in  this direction.  A case could be m ade based on the Greenbook forecast for hold ing the funds rate constan t today and recognizing the downside risks with a statem ent that the risks were unbalanced toward econom ic weakness.  You wouldn' t have to twist my arm  too much to ge t me to support that. But your proposed policy recognizes the clear downside risks that rem ain, wh ile at least signaling a m ore cautious approach to further easing. It alerts m arkets that we m ay be at or near the end of an easing cycle.  It makes it easier for us to hold the funds  rate constant at the next m eeting, while also retaining the flexibility to ease further should the in coming data point in  that direction. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. Would you read the appropriate statem ent for that po licy? 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD. This is on page 16 of the Bluebook:  “The Federal Open Market Comm ittee seeks m onetary and fina ncial conditions that will f oster price stability and prom ote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objec tives, the Comm ittee in the  imm ediate future seeks conditions in reserve m arkets consiste nt with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3-3/4 percent.” And the balan ce of risks sentence for the press statem ent:  “Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable econom ic growth and of the infor mation currently available, the Committee believes tha t the risks con tinue to be weighted mainly toward  conditions that m ay generate econo mic weakne ss in the foreseeab le future.” 6/26-27/01 153

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Can we distribut e the draft statem ent consonant with this?  Do we have copies?   This statem ent is written on the prem ise that the Board of Governors will m ove on the dis count action.  Obviously, sh ould that pro ve to be in correct, we' d have to revise this. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Do you want m e to say a few wor ds about the statem ent?

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Go ahead, why don't you. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. In response to the discussion at the last meeting, Chairman Greenspan thought it might be wise to m ake a few changes with regard to  the statem ent released after Comm ittee m eetings.  One is to have a little m ore structured discussion by having m e introduce the statem ent and the thinking behind its wording. Second, we wanted to give all of you a little more tim e to read it and react.  Third, in respons e to your request at the last m eeting, it h as been shortened su bstantially.  We did so prim arily by referring to a continuatio n of recent p atterns, which m eant that we didn' t have to refer to all th e pieces of those patterns, just the main parts.  That was our thinking behind the second full pa ragraph.  The statem ent does refer to the 275 basis points of easing to date , which was intended to send the m essage that the Comm ittee 6/26-27/01 154 recognizes that it has eased a great deal so far.   There is no reference to “monitoring carefully,” wording som e market participan ts are looking for as a signa l that over th is eigh t-wee k interm eeting period the Comm ittee will be on h igh aler t to respond to incom ing data.  So, that is not in th ere.  And finally,  we tied th e productivity  trends and their im plications for the longer-run outlook to th e statem ent about the b alance of risk s in the foreseeable future.  So there is a bit of a contrast between the longer-term  prospects for productivity growth in the econom y and the shorter-term  risks for th e foreseeable future. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  I guess the silence could be replaced by applause. The silence is pretty pleasant.  

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I’m not so bold as to m ake that interpretation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Did we m ake it s hort enough so that there is nothing to be said about it? 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Well, I hate to depart [la ughter] from  this general satisfaction, but I would take out that reference to  profitability and just say “dec lining business capital spending.”  My guess is, given the trend in labor costs and so forth, that declining profitability m ay be with us for a while. I don' t know why we’ d want to single that out. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  No, I think that's pr ecisely the reason we do.  In fact it' s a cruc ial element in the- -  

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Well, but there are som e interesting issues involved, having to do with profit share and labor share, and so on.  You know, it m ay be that all we' re seeing is a return to more norm ality.  I guess that is m y thought. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Yes, but even if that's true, if that argum ent were valid today, it would have been valid at th e last m eeting and the meeting before. 6/26-27/01 155 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Well, I was going to rais e it at our last m eeting.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There’s a statute of lim itations!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Well, I don' t know.  Is there a la w that says once profita bility is in here it has to stay forever? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No. Frankly, taking it out at this par ticular stage I th ink creates m ore potential p roblem s than leaving it do es becaus e this wording is alm ost identical to what we’ve said in the p ast.   

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Okay, I will find that a com pelling argum ent.  But I would also hope that at som e point we can find an  excuse to get it out of there. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, when profits start going up.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Maybe even before then. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is that all right with everybody?  Can we go into recess and have the  Board of  Governors m eet in m y office?  We will be back to r eport on that deliberation. [Recess] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  The Board of Governors voted to lower th e discoun t rate by 1 /4 percentage po int.
