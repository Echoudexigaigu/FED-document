MR. KOS. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I will be referring to the charts that were distributed at  your p laces earlier this m orning. 1      The first chart depicts the standard 3-month cash and forward deposit rates from early April through last Friday.  As you can see, U.S. short-term rates continued to decline over the recent intermeeting interval. Weak corporate earnings, layoff announcements, and a Beige Book that was perceived as downb eat were among many other factors that affected sentiment during the period.  Three-month cash and forward rates declined by about 20 ba sis points over the period.  Nine-month forward rates rose immediately after the June FOMC meeting but then declined quickly and on balance fell about 35 basis points for the period as a whole. While the 9-month forward rate may suggest that the market is building toward a tightening later in 2002, as perhaps does the Eurodollar future strip, other indicators such as the   2-year note are more ambiguous--a subj ect I’ll talk about later.      In the euro area, cash rates ha ve been stable sin ce the last meeting, but 3-month and 9-month forward ra tes have continued to be pulled lower, by 16 and 21 basis points respectively.  Forecasts for the euro-area economy have been trimmed and the market is cautiously building in some additional easing, with ma ny market participants expecting 25 basis points of ease at the end of th is month.  The la rgest changes in rates occurred on August 8th and 9th after the Beige Book was released here and the ECB’s monthly report, which was viewed as paving the way for an ease in policy, was released in Europe.       The bottom panel shows the Japanese government yield curve from 3 months out to 10 years.  I’ve hi ghlighted three snapshots coinciding with the last two FOMC meeting dates and this past Friday, ahead of the current meeting.  The short end of  the curve is below 20 basis points 1 The charts used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript. 8/21/01 2 out to 3 years, but the longer end of  the curve has proved more resistant to further prodding by the Bank of Japan. The announcement by the Bank of Japan on August 14th that it would increase its current account balance target from 5 trillion to 6 tr illion and also raise the pace of JGB purchases has not noticeably affected the yield curve. In fact, the longer end of the curve is actua lly higher than it was on June 26th.       Turning to page 2, I’ve provide d a snapshot of asset prices in U.S. exchange markets--reflect a con tinually shifting sentiment and are discounting a weaker outlook. The to p panel shows the 2-, 10-, and 30-year yields along with the fe d funds target since April 1st. The entire curve has shifted lower and the 2- to 30-year spread has steepened by another 10 basis points, from about 166 basis points at the time of the last meeting to about 176 basis points at the close yesterday.         I would make two points.  First, benchmark long-term rates have come down quite a bit in the last seven weeks.  The 10-year is down about 40 basis points and the 30-year  is down somewhat less, by about 20 basis points. Second, the 2-year note traded as low as 3.64 percent during this period, the lowest rate since the 2-year note began to be regularly auctioned in 1976. By  way of comparison, during 1992 and 1993, when the funds rate was at 3 percent for an extended period of time, the 2-year rate never fell below 3.66 percent.  Given the sensitivity of the 2-year note to th e funds rate, if the markets were building toward a tightening at some point--as suggested by the Eurodollar futures and the forward rate agreements--then one might have expected the 2-year note yield to be higher th an it is now.  So, its behavior at least raises questions about the signals being given by some of those other indicators.       In the middle panel I’ve plotted the major U.S. stock indices indexed to 100 on April 1st, which also coincides roughly with their lows for 2001. As reflected in the chart, those indi ces rose through much of the spring but have been coming down--and have continued to come down in the intermeeting peri od--as the market has adjusted to the weaker outlook.       The bottom panel shows change s in the trade-weighted value of the dollar against other major currencies.  The dollar has declined modestly on a trade-weighted basis, but that masks sharper declines against some of the major currencies, especially the yen, the euro, the Swiss franc, and even some other currencies such as the Singapore dollar that have been used as funding currencies in so -called carry trades.  In part the reflect some risk aversion.  As ec onomic activity seems to be slowing 8/21/01 3globally, a little risk aversion m ay lead  to a closing out of some carry trades. And finally, som e of the ongoing chatter in m arkets about the Adm inistration’s posture toward the dollar m ay also be a contributing factor.       Turning to the third page, th e top panel depicts the m ajor European equity indices, also going back to early April.  They show a sim ilar patte rn to th at in U.S. markets excep t that the de cline h as been m ore dram atic for European equities, espe cially over the interm eeting period.  In that interval m ost of these m ajor indices fell between 3-1/2 and 10 percen t, in p art reflectin g revis ions in forecasts f or growth as  well as weak earnings. Interestingly, though, the euro actually had one of its sharpest rallies since its launch, m oving from  about 85 cents to alm ost 92 cents during this period for reasons that are not fully clear, given some of the news that w as com ing out of Europe.  One explanation might be that interest rate differentia ls are finally biting.  Those interest rates have been narrowing for alm ost two years in favor of the euro.  The bottom  panel shows the differentia ls between dollar and euro swap rates. These spreads con tinue to decline m odestly but are s till sligh tly in favor of the dollar.       Turning to the next page , the top panel depicts the dollar-yen exchange rate. A couple of notewor thy events have taken place in Japan since the last FOMC m eeting. First, the Upper House elections were held and the LDP and Prim e Minister Koizum i did quite well--an outcom e that is exp ected  to accelerate structural refor ms in Japan.  Second, on August 14th the BOJ announced changes in its operational targets, as I noted earlier. That combination would have been expected to produce a weakening in the yen and a lift to the  equity m arkets.  In the event, the yen actually has appr eciated from  about 125 to below 120 this m orning and equity prices have continued their dec line, as ref lected in the m iddle panel.  The reasons for the yen’s appreciation are not fully obvious. Repatriation and the a pproach of the end of the fiscal half-year have been m entioned yet ag ain.  Another possibility is that there m ay be som e risk aversion kicking in that is causing som e of the short yen trades to be unwound. But it’s not im mediately apparent why the yen would be appreciating in  this kind of environm ent. As I m entioned, Japanese equities  have continued to decline with only a brief interruption after the Up per House elections and the BOJ’s operational changes. The Nikkei, wh ich was over 13,000 at the tim e of the last FOMC m eeting is now be low 12,000 and at its lowest level since 1984. The Topix Bank sub-ind ex has also been falling again, reflecting renewed doubts about the health of the Japanese banking system .  As the bottom  panel shows, that sub-index is actually lower now than it was during the 1998 banking crisis in Japan. 8/21/01 4      Turning to the last page, the chart shows monthly growth rates, seasonally adjusted, for currency during 2001. As you can see, we’ve had elevated currency growth in July and also in August.  Most of that is attributed to cash sh ipments overseas, primarily to Argentina.  The growth of currency has been r unning at roughly double the rates observed earlier this year, translati ng into deepening reserve needs over the past intermeeting period.  Those deeper needs were met primarily by an expansion of the permanent SOMA portfolio and by a modest increase in the amount of long-term RPs outstanding.         Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations during the intermeeting period, but I will ne ed a vote to ratify the domestic operations. And I will be happy to take any questions.

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Thank you, Mr. Chai rman.  A reader of this meeting’s Greenbook could be forgiven, I think, for contracting at least a mild case of sticker shock.  After all, we revised down our estimate of growth for the current year--alrea dy half completed--by 0.4 percentage point, and for next year by twice th at much, to cut 1-1/4 percentage points from the level of GDP by the end of next year.  But rather than casting this forecast as a big change from its predecessor, I would like to begin today by making the case that this can largely be seen as a status quo forecast.       Without a doubt, there has been  considerable buzz in the last few weeks about the revisions to th e national income accounts and how dramatically those revisions have changed perceptions of macroeconomic reality.  In a way, of  course, that is correct.  The revised figures suggest that firms invested much less than previously estimated during the past three year s.  Accordingly, capital deepening occurred at a slower pace, and th at has important implications, of course, for growth prospects. As my colleagues Fleischman, Sichel, and Struckmeyer outlined in their memo to you last week, we have trimmed our estimate of potential GDP growth by four tenths this year and six tenths next year .  Obviously, a revision of  this magnitude is of enormous consequence for some issues, including assessments of the 8/21/01 5 trend rate of  growth in the standa rd of living, the long-term  outlook for the federal budget, and the solvency  of the Social Security system .       But the implications of th e NIPA revisions for the conduct of monetary policy could easily be ov erdone.  To a first approximation, the recent history of inflation remains essentially as previously estimated.  From that, we infer to a first approximation that the pressures on productive resources probably were about as we had estimated based on the previous numbers.  In particular, the gap between actual and potential GDP pr obably was about as we had it, albeit with lower levels of  both actual and potential output.       Previously, we had been attributing a goodly portion of the outstanding inflation performance of th e late 1990s to the acceleration in structural productivity. No w, with the productivity boom downgraded a notch, it can obviously do less of the work for us in terms of explaining why inflation has stayed so low during the last five or six years. So what explains  the extraordinar ily good inflation performance of the late 1990s?  The short answer is that we don’t know for sure, but something else must ha ve been causing inflation to behave so well despite the low unemployme nt rate.  Often cited candidates include the rise of temporary help  supply firms, better job matching facilitated by the Internet, welfar e reform, and reduced pricing power due to more intense foreign competition.  Before, we were in the slightly awkward position of having no room for any of these entirely plausible explanations to play a role.  Now, there is scope for these possible changes in the behavior of la bor and product markets to be part of the story. While we are uncerta in about the precise magnitudes of the various individual effects, we are assuming they will persist, with the consequence being essentially equi valent to a reduction in the long-run NAIRU from 5-1/2 percent to 5-1/4 percent.       Thus, when all the dust ha s settled, our assessment is that you are operating in an environment that in so me ways looks very similar to the one we saw in June: Inflation is about the same and the pressures on resource utilization look similar.  As a result, the stance of monetary policy, as gauged by the gap between r and r*, also looks about the same.       That said, let me now turn up the microscope and point out some of the adjustments that we have made to our outlook in the context of that broadly similar framework.  By far the most important of these adjustments is a further marki ng down of our outlook for business investment.  As you know, the data on orders for June were extraordinarily weak, headlined by a 13 percent decline in orders for communications equipment, not at an annual rate.  As we could find 8/21/01 6little solace either in the Beige B ook or in our own informal contacts with members of the business community, we are now assuming that this quarter’s decline in real spending for equipment and software will be essentially as steep as  last quarter’s.  We’re also assuming that the fourth quarter will show no great im provement either.  In addition, we have turned much more bearis h on the outlook for nonresidential structures. While the commercial real estate sector seems to have avoided repeating the excesses of th e late 1980s, vacancy rates have been rising sharply of late and we  foresee several more quarters of supported by the reports summarized in the Beige Book and elsewhere.       In contrast, we continue to be surprised to the upside by the strength of consumer spending.  The advance estimate of retail sales for July was noticeably stronger than we ha d been expecting, and with the tax rebate arriving in most households’ mailboxes this month and next, we still anticipate that household spe nding will provide important support to activity in the months ahead.       The only other notable modification to our near-term outlook is mostly just a matter of timing.  By  our assessment, automakers have been in the process of building more  vehicles--especially trucks--this quarter than we think they can reasonably expect to sell. As a consequence, we think they will need to cut production significantly in the fourth quarter. The resul ting swings in production, on our assumptions, add about 1/2 percentage point to GDP growth this quarter and take away about 1-1/4 pe rcentage point next quarter.  We substantially, a sharp cutback in  production from current plans sometime in the next few months seems highly likely.  And Ford’s announcement last week--which is already built into our numbers--is probably only the beginning.       So from a larg er perspective, how should you, as the principals in this process, audit the reasonableness of our proj ection?  As a starting point, I suggest that you consider th ree basic questions.  First, do you find our revisions to potential GDP growth plausible?  We now have the growth of potential GDP slowing fr om 3-3/4 percent last year to 3 percent this year and to 2-3/4 percen t next year, reflecting a slower pace of capital deepening. I should note, for those who are trying to gauge the long-term growth potential of  the economy, that on our current outlook for business investment we w ould have the growth of potential edging back up perhaps to about 3 percent after 2002.       Second, do you find it plausible th at we have adjusted our forecast for actual GDP roughly in line with the revision to potential, leaving 8/21/01 7 aside some issues of lags?  Our theory  in making this adjustment is that households and firms shoul d not be completely oblivious to the change in the outlook. Indeed, households and firms were likely on to this even before we were. In particul ar, we know that for the most part households tie their spending to the trend in their income.  And if the trend in their income slows, th en we should have a good deal of confidence that their spending will slow  as well, even if with a short lag. We also know that businesse s gauge their need for productive plant and equipment to the pace of th eir current and expected activity.  And if they sense that activity is not living up to prior billing, they can be counted on to trim their investment spending accordingly.       I should hasten to say that not everyone is as glum as we are about the near-term prospects for real activ ity; for example, the most recent Blue Chip consensus is at 2-1/4 perc ent for growth in the second half.  But in the face of a noticeably weaker foreign outlook, unremitting gloom from the industria l sector, continued bad news from the tech sector, and a steady drumbeat of negative earnings and layoff announcements, I am a bit hard pressed to share their optimism.       Third, do you find our cautious optimism about the outlook for inflation plausible? To be sure, as  we highlighted in the “alternative simulations” section of the Gr eenbook, the substantial downward revision to the markup in the NIPA  accounts appears to take away a cushion we thought firms had to absorb future cost pressures. If firms move to restore that cushion, the consequence could be several more tenths of inflation as early as next  year.  However, the environment we see is one of low capacity utilization,  increasing slack in labor markets, and earlier retrenchment in energy pri ces than we had previously been expecting. Moreover, we believe th e revised data on compensation per hour for the year 2000 may be importantly distorted by the treatment of options granted by employers, so we have been inclined to discount these data. While margins clearly cannot be suppressed without limit, we are inclined to believe that the plausible limit has not been reached yet, and so we anticipate con tinued relatively good inflation performance over the forecast period.      Let me conclude by focusing on one of the risks to the outlook that we highlighted in the “alternative simulations” section of the Greenbook--namely, the risk of a major stock market correction.  Contrary to my general story line th at the NIPA revisions did not affect much of interest, I don’t think that ’s the case here.  As you know, there were downward revisions over the last  several years to NIPA dividends and earnings. Moreover, our analysis leads us to be considerably more guarded in our assessment of the out look for the trends in these series based on the downward revised growth in potential output.  That  Wall Street Journalimplies that today’s level of equity prices is being carried on a shakier foundation of fundamentals.  I should  add parenthetically that I think this morning’s story in the   reinforces this view, although it doesn’t alter the validity of the NIPA accounts because, for all their shortcomings, the NIPA acc ounts happen to get this aspect of earnings reporting correct. On the whol e, this leads us to conclude that whatever our level of apprehension a bout the market before the release of the NIPA data, it probably ought to be moved up a notch in light of the new information. 8/21/01 8

MR. REINHART. Perhaps the ha rdest cha lleng e conf rontin g the staff as we sorted through the incom ing data ove r the in termeeting period to prepare a forecast for th e global economy was to avoid falling into a s elf-reinforcing sp iral of pe ssimism.  As the forecastin g process unfolded, we m arked down the outlook for econom ic growth abroad in part because of weaker prospects at home.  But this tr anslated into th e expectation of both lower U.S. net ex ports and a weaker global m arket for technological products, trimm ing the projection for U.S. GDP and creating obvious im plications for ove rseas activity.  This iterative process converged at a significantly  weakened projection for foreign econom ic growth relative to what yo u saw eight weeks ago.  Still, we think forces are in p lace that will fo ster a revival in growth, albeit a little m ore delayed and to a som ewhat  slower pace than thought at the time of the June m eeting.       As for the near-term  outlook, real GDP in the foreign industrial countries is expected to  expand at just over a 1 percent annual rate in the second half of 2001, about 1/2 percentage point slower than forecasted in June. We have also penciled in only m odest ex pansion in the developing econom ies of Asia  and Latin America over the remainder of the year that puts the leve l of their output at the end of this year 1-1 /4 percent, on average, below our projection in the last Greenbook. Three factors m ostly account for our m ore pessim istic take on the pace of global econom ic activity th is year. First, incom ing data on spendi ng, production, and em ploym ent have alm ost invariably disappointe d.  Output contracted in Germ any and Italy in the second quarter, a nd more forward-looking indicators of household confidence and business pur chasing intentions do not bode well for growth going forward in the euro area.  While dom estic spending in Canada has held up well  thus far, employm ent is beginning to sag. And Japan appears to have slipped into an other recession.  Real GDP is also declining in the devel oping countries of Asia that direct much of their exports to the globa l electronics m arket and in those countries in Latin Am erica with tr ade tightly linked  to the United States. Meanwhile, the prices of  many inte rnatio nally traded 8/21/01 9commoditie s have continued to tum ble, which is  probably a sign of falling contemporaneous dem and.       That lea ds natura lly to th e second source of downward revision to foreign growth--the m arking lower of the near-term  U.S. outlook.  We’ve pulled down our projection of activity abroad both because some of the adverse effect of m ore slowly growing dem and in the United States falls on foreign m arkets and becaus e an im portant drag on our own econom y--redu ced dem ands for capital attend ant to the re -evaluation of the prospects for the te ch sector--is also playing out in many other countries. Third, it has becom e painf ully clea r that the f inancial crisis in Argentina has already extracted a hea vy economic toll there.  Output is contracting, unem ployment is rising,  and prices are declining.  Meanwhile, risk sp reads rem ain elev ated and dep osits in the b anking sector are running off rapidly. Indeed, the m ost obvious vote of “no confidence” in the cu rrent situation is what Dino already related--th at an estim ated $4 billion of U.S. currency was shipped to Argentina last month. Perhaps it evidences our la ck of i magination, but we find it hard to picture how the governm ent of Argentina can extricate itself from this situation in a m anner th at stanches ou tput losses an ytime soon. And without econom ic growth, its poor fiscal position stemm ing from  its hig h debt burden will onl y look more unsustain able than it does today, and the th reat of spillov ers to Argen tina’s neigh bors will b e that m uch more palpable.  After the forecast was pu t to bed, we received data on U.S. international trade for June that woul d not lead us to alter the top-lin e number we wrote down in the Gr eenbook but that did serve to underscore our sense of ongoing wea kness in global econom ic activity.  The U.S. trade deficit on goods and services, at $29-1/2 billion, was about what we were expecting a nd close to the number the BEA assum ed in constructing its prelim inary estim ate of second-quarter GDP. What surprised us, however, was that this  deficit was arriv ed at by shrinking the values of both expor ts and im ports.  Particularly of note was the fact that the dollar va lue of capital goods crossing our borders in either direction was sm aller in June than in May, extending the trend of the past few months. While I’ve emphasized the downward revision of foreign econom ic growth in the near term , perhaps the most im portant feature of the outlook is unchanged. We still believe that econom ic growth abroad will pick up next year to a ra te not very m uch below that of its potential. This growth revival m ay be a bit m ore attenuated than in the prior few Greenbooks, but it still relies on the sam e four forces. 8/21/01 10 First and foremost, as David has already described, the expansion of U.S. economic activity is expected  to step up in 2002.  We think that will be associated with a large positiv e swing in the growth of U.S. real imports that will benefit activity in our trading partners.  Moreover, given that the U.S. growth pickup includes a turnaround in investment, greater demands for capital here will  brighten the outlook for the tech sector worldwide. Second, while data on inventories ab road are spotty and unreliable, we believe that part of the dynamics of the slowing of the past few quarters in many foreign countri es has included a production adjustment in response to some st ockbuilding that developed as demand weakened unexpectedly.  As invent ories stop falling next year, that drag on real GDP growth will be lifted. Third, monetary policy in many i ndustrial countries has already weighed in to support aggregate demand going forward. We think that most of those central banks will cont inue to ease and that some other central banks will join in.  In the case of the Bank of Japan, however, it remains to be seen whether an elevated provision of liquidity, which was announced last week, will bolster spending given that the policy rate is already at its ze ro floor.  The issues are more conventional when it comes to Europe.  In common with the net judgment of participants pricing money market futures, we believe that the European Central Bank will ease 50 basis points by year-end, as their task is made easier by declines in headline inflation induced by falling energy prices. Fourth, with regard to energy mo re generally, the price of West Texas intermediate oil has fallen ab out $4 per barrel over the past three quarters, and our forecast, following  oil futures markets, holds that another $3 per barrel price drop is in store by year-end 2002.  We anticipate that this price decline has been and will be shifting income to those residents of the global economy  who are more likely to spend it, bolstering consumption in many countries. Although we’re relatively confident about the existe nce of these forces helping to shape a rebound in spending in 2002, their magnitude, timing, and whether other sources of restraint will more than offset their impetus are far from certain.  Two prominent risks emanate from global financial markets. For one, we assumed in our projection that the real foreign exchange value of the dollar would follow a track tilted slightly downward. But the fact is that the dollar’s value fell more in the past week than the decline stretched out over the next six quarters in our 8/21/01 11 projection. This recent downdraft might be the first sign of a risk factor that we’ve fretted about for some tim e--that foreign investors’ appetite for adding to their holdings of U.S.  obligations will wane.  But the foreign exchange market has given us  false signals before, so we have treated this latest stepdown as evidence of greater odds on a downside risk rather than as a reason to pull down our baseline forecast.  To get a sense of how events may unfold s hould that risk materialize, we included an alternative simulati on in the Greenbook in which the dollar’s broad real value drops nearly  one-quarter by early next year.  From a U.S. perspective, the resu lting ratcheting higher of foreign relative to domestic pric es encourages exports and pulls down imports to add about 3/4 percentage point to  GDP growth in the first half of next year and twice that amount in  the second half.  The impetus to inflation is even more striking, with core inflation running 1-1/2 percentage points faster by the end of  next year.  The chief risk to the global economy is that this relative price change off-loads some of our ongoing weakness to our trading partne rs.  With the nominal interest rate already at zero in Japan and th e fiscal deficit a source of concern, Japanese policymakers may be poor ly positioned to counter such imported weakness and, unless the st ronger euro emboldens the ECB, European policymakers may not be willing to do so. As another risk, our Latin American outlook assumes that the fallout from problems in Argentina will be relatively contained to that nation’s immediate trading partners and other Latin countries reliant on international capital markets.  That assumption was based on the logic that global investors have seen this coming and that the IMF’s stand-by arrangement with Brazil will ring-fe nce that country.  But part of Argentine officials’ bargaining strate gy of late has apparently been to elevate expectations in the market of  the size of a package in order to put pressure on the international financial institutions.  If either less new money is forthcoming than those encouraged expectations or what comes fails to cover Argentina’s subsequent reserve losses, then the scope and severity of contagion may be more than we’ve built into the Greenbook. I don’t have a simulation to point to mainly because it didn’t seem like a productive use of our large-scale macro models, as it would be highly nonlinear and especially dependent on market sentiment.  That concludes our presentation, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Questions fo r our colleagues?  President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. David, you mentioned three considerations that we might want to take into account as we look at the forecast.  The second was that th e variability in aggregate supply gets translated pretty much on a one-for-one basi s into the variability in aggregate demand.  I 8/21/01 12 must adm it I was a little surprise d by that in the sense that a lthough current short-term prospects for earnings and for incom e are likely to affect  dem and, I believe that perm anent incom e also plays som e role.  If that’s  the cas e--if there are more perm anent influences--in term s of aggregate demand, wouldn’t there be less of a re sponse than a one-for-one change? 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  Let m e make two comm ents on that.  First of all, I m ade an oblique reference to the issu e of lags.  We translate a dow nward shift in the trend in incom es to consum er spending with a lagged response of a couple of qua rters.  We think it takes households a little while to catch on to this change. We brought  down potential GDP growt h by 0.4 percentage point this year. We think about half of that lower potential grow th this year translates into a reduction in actual GDP growth. For next year we took potentia l down by 0.6 percentage point.  And by that tim e we believe the adjustm ent pro cess is far enough along so that households will begin to recognize a softening in their incom e prospects, and indeed in their perm anent incom e, and that will be incorporated into their spendi ng.  So we feel that ove r that kind of time horizon it’s realistic to build ch anges in the fundam ental tenor of in come into the growth of consum er spending.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  No fu rther ques tions?   Who would like to start our Comm ittee discussion? President Broaddus.   

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  The overall econom ic picture in our District has not changed m arkedly over the last several weeks.  Manufact uring ac tivity continue s to decline, although perh aps at a b it slower pace than earlier.  The key issu e, of course,  as 8/21/01 13 highlighted in the Beige Book summary, is whethe r the weakness in the m anufacturing sector is going to spill over into other sect ors of the economy.  I don’t think we have any very conclusive evidence reg arding that in our Dist rict.  I read a b ook recen tly that talked about a tou rist at Fort Sumter asking a guide why so m any Civil W ar batt les were fought at nati onal parks [laughter] so I’m very skittish, even more so tha n usual, abo ut ascribing causality.  However, re tail sales hav e weakened in  our area in recent weeks,  in contrast  to the nation al data, and it seem s reas onable to me to speculate that at least som e of this wea kness reflects the softne ss in m anufacturing.  And the problems from  high-tech m anufacturing and related industries clearly are contributing to what appears to be a growing weakness in comme rcial real es tate and comm ercial cons truction activ ity in p arts of  our D istrict where high-tech activity is concentrated, such as Northern Virginia and  the Raleigh -Durham  area in North C arolina.   We don’t see in our region any definitiv e indication that m anufacturing is  bottom ing out yet, but there are at least a few straws in the wind.  I have a contact in a sizable trucking company that is based in Richm ond but does a lot of  busines s with th e furniture m anufacturers and others in the Carolinas. His firm does a large volum e of business and it’s broadly spread, and I think he’s a reliable source of infor mation.  He tells m e that his custom ers’ shipments have been stab ilizing m ost recently and th at severa l manufacturing  operations in the Carolinas are telling him  that conditions are at least not gettin g any worse.  Elsewhere,  revenues in District service industries other than retailing continue  to grow at a healthy pace, according to the monthly service sector survey we do. And resi dential sales and constr uction activity are holding at their recent high levels. So to summarize on the District, we have not  seen a lot of ch ange excep t perhaps som e negative spillover from  manufactur ing to other sectors of the ec onom y.  But there is a glimm er 8/21/01 14 of an inflection point in m anufacturing, to use a phrase that Jeff Lacker coined the other day.   The Greenb ook forecast for the national econo my has an in flection po int of its own.  The forecast calls for the declin e in the rate of real GDP growth to end in the second  quarter and for growth to reaccelerate gradually this year and next year.  There are obv iously s ignificant downside ris ks in this forecast, and David has no ted a num ber of them .  One is th e pro jected return of business investm ent to at least a m odera te upward trajectory next spring; it could take longer. Consum er spending could be significan tly weaker than projected for any num ber of reasons, and all the downside risks in the dom estic outlook obviously are com pounde d by the cumulating weakness in the international economy.   But in m y view there are also som e modest  signs of i mprovem ent.  The retail sales report for th e month of July, released  recen tly, go t my attentio n.  I think it’s quite pos itive when one digs down into the details. It’s only one m onthly report to be su re, but it is a t least consisten t with the ide a that the r eduction in energy prices --or the an ticipa tion of declining energy prices- -and the significant m onetary stim ulus already in the pipeline m ay be shor ing up household spending. Elsewhere, m anufacturing activity as measured in the industr ial production index was flat last m onth after a long series of monthly de clines.  Even when one abstracts from  the strong motor vehicle production, what is left is a dec line but a sm aller decline than we’ve seen for a number of months.  Job m arkets are still softening but overall the July report suggests that they are reinforced by the continuing streng th in residential construction.   The curren t view in financial m arkets, as re ported in the m edia at leas t, seem s to be that a bottom ing out in the econom y is now furt her out in the future than m ost people had thought several weeks ago. The r ecent inform ation I just cited suggests that the gradual upturn 8/21/01 15 in the economy, as projected in the Greenbook, is actually a little m ore plausible now  than it might have been at the tim e of our l ast meeting, or at least it seem s that way to m e.  The implication of this for policy, in m y view, is that the econom y could turn  up sooner rather than later, although that’s certainly not  a sure thing.  And if  it does, with unemplo yment still relatively low and the real funds rate quite low, we m ay need to reverse c ourse prom ptly and remove som e of the stim ulus that is currently in the pipeline.  Histor ically, this has always been a very difficult thing for the Fed to do. So I think w e need to be gin to prepare ourselves as well as the public for this possibility, in the absence of a m arked further weakening in the econom ic outlook.  Thank you.

MR. MCTEER. At each of our recen t meetings  I’ve expected better news next tim e, and each time the news h as been disappointing.  The slowdown is now a year old and  shows few signs of coming to an end. Monetary policy ea sing began almost eight months ago.  Fiscal policy has n ow eased an d tax reb ate checks are in  the m ail.  More recently, we seem  to have escaped a w orsening of the energy crunch.  These three m ajor factors--m onetary s timulus in th e pipeline, checks in the mail, and im provem ent in the energy outlook--should help to produce a turnaround but there is scant eviden ce that they have started to  do so yet.  Monetary policy probably has helped to cushion the decline, wh ich has proven to be worse than expected.   Three special sources of stre ngth in the Eleventh Distri ct used to be high-tech manufacturing, trade with a boom ing Mexico, an d energy.  High-tech m anufacturing is in a serious recession. The Mexican econom y is declining.  And the energy boost seem s to have peaked out, luckily. Texas employment growt h, which had e xceeded th e national average in nine of the past ten years, has weakened sharply in every region and sector of the state, but m ost 8/21/01 16 sharply in th e techno logy centers of Austin and North Dallas.  Because of energy th ere is continued m oderate growth in the H ouston area, however.  The decline in Mexican manufacturing, especially along the border in th e maquiladora plants, is being felt in Texas border towns. In the energy area, rig counts both in Texas and the nation are below their July peaks.  About 80 percent of drilling is for natural gas,  for which the price has declined below $4 per thousand to around $3 now. That is still som ewhat high by recent historic al standards but it is back close to its m ore usual re lationship to the price of crude oil.  The mood rem ains dark in most techno logy sectors,  but som e anecdotal co mments are beginning to b e more positive in the semiconductor industry.  The U.S. sem iconduc tor equipm ent book-to-bill ratio has risen modestly since hitting an a ll tim e low of 0.36 in April. At the natio nal lev el, the Greenboo k forecas t and the GDP revisions tell us that no t only is the current economy getting worse but so has the past.  Neith er the past nor th e future is what it used to be. [Laughter] And the risks to the forecast seem  mostly to be on the downside.  The m ain positiv e in the Greenbook was the slig htly im proved outlook f or inflation over the forecast period, and I’m  not very con fident about th at.  One way to look at the situatio n is that more slack in the econo my will pro duce less p ressure on p rices.  But an other way to  look at it includes the possibility that s upply m ay be cut back faster th an dem and, a reversal of the disinflationary consequences of ra pid output growth in the late 1990s. Based only on the state of the economy and its near-term  prospects, a large policy action is called for today. But it’s a closer call when we consid er the lags and the degree of stimulus already in the pipeline.  As for th e directive and the bias  statem ent, I don’t know whether it’s bette r to sp eak sof tly and carry a big stick or to be m ore diplom atic and say “nice 8/21/01 17 doggy” while looking for an even bigger stick. If the bias statement and the press release weren’t already written, I’d say it’ s going to be difficult to write them this time.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  It was! President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. On balance the Seventh District econom y has not changed significantly since m y report in June, but m ost reports now seem somewhat more pessim istic than before, at leas t about the near future .  Overall activity has remained quite sluggish and that has been disa ppointing for m any businesses that had expected, or at leas t hoped, that so me evidence of an upturn would be visible by now.  The expected improvem ent in th e econ omy seem s further in th e future than when we m et in June.  In fact, m ost business people we talk to do not expect a signi ficant recovery in m anufact uring before next spring. There are few signs that capital spending is about to pick  up and there’s growing concern about how long consumers can cont inue to prop up the economy.   Manufacturing has been our weakest link fo r about a year now.  While som e key manufacturing industries have m ade substantia l progress in working dow n excess inventories, overall production rem ains very weak.  The light ve hicle industry is somewhat of an exception; on average inventories are now in good shape.  Production nationally has been trending up somewhat since January and capacity  utilization is up to 88 percen t, about as good as it gets in the auto industry. Of course, even this i ndustry is not out of the woods, as David W ilcox mentioned earlier.  So far this y ear, s ubstantial in centiv es have been needed to keep light vehicle sales at high levels, and industry contacts indicate that sales have been sof t so far in A ugust.  And m ore generally, they expect sales to be lower in the second half than in  the first half of the year. In add ition, incen tive spending is not exp ected to change m uch, and that m eans profits will continue to be squeezed. 8/21/01 18Most firms are still attemp ting to reduce costs and are being very cautious about capital spending. Indeed, the outlo ok for capital spending is poor in a large number of industries.  For example, no recovery is in sight for heavy truck sales.  The steel industry has little incentive to increase capital spending, given the significant excess capacity and the la ck of pricing power.  The gypsum wallboard industry is also plagued with over-capacity despite th e fact that the robust housing market has helped keep shipments strong.  And high-tech remains an area of special weakness, with most observers indicating that it will be some time before the overhang can be worked off. One piece of good news cam e from the pape r industry where dem and for cardboard boxes im proved in the last few weeks.  But our c ontacts em phasized that the im provem ent really has not lasted long enough to discern a turn. Consum er spending and ho using activity are still holding up reasonably w ell in our District, althou gh m any retailers have becom e less optim istic about the future. Reports indicate softer cons umer spending in the Midw est than elsewhere in the country, am id signs that individuals are b ecom ing more price conscious.  Discounters and value-oriented retailers seem  to be the m ost aggressive in trying to capture the tax ref und business. While sales results are still rather sk etchy, it appears that thos e retailers are the ones that are benefiting the m ost.  Even as the tax rebate checks trickl e into the econom y, many retailers con tinue to low er their sales expectations for the f all and f or the winter.  Our housing m arkets rem ain relatively robus t, although som e contacts are skeptical about how long such resilience will continue. We’ve had scattered reports of reductions in asking prices for som e higher priced hom es in Chicago, although these pr ices are still above year-ago levels. And I’ve becom e increasingly concerned about potential overbuildin g in this sector, given the trem endous am ount of resi dential construction near and around downtown 8/21/01 19 Chicago. So far, however, the housing num bers have  remained at high levels and hom es that are priced righ t continue to s ell quickly, often with multip le bidd ers.   Things are n ot quite so rosy on the n onresiden tial constructio n side.  Office vacancy rates have continued to increase in many areas as  dem and has slowed.  The REITs tell us that large firm s with leases com ing up for renewal ar e consis tently cutting back their office space requirem ents.  With these trends visible nationw ide as well, there has b een a significant advers e impact on the office furniture industry that is co ncentrated in western Mi chigan.  This industry expects to see the sharpest drop in  shipments since reco rds were firs t tallied in the e arly ’70s.   Since the slowdown began, our labor m arkets have eased som ewhat m ore than they have in the nation as a whole. District em ployers are still reporti ng that it’s less d ifficult to hir e and retain w orkers in m ost areas and that wage pressures have subsided further.  Total payroll employm ent in our five-state area has been  below year-ago levels for tw o months now, something we haven’t experienced since the end of 1991.  However, the latest Manpower Survey, which will be released  publicly next Mo nday, August 27th, shows a sm all pickup in the hiring intentions of Midwestern em ployers for the fourth quarter, whic h may indicate that the worst is over for our region. The national index d eclined slightly furthe r, however, taking it to its lowest level since the end of 1993. Turning to the national outlook, like m any of our business contacts we think the pickup in econom ic gro wth will be delayed further.   We still believe th e second quarter will be the worst of  this cy cle, b ut growth th is quar ter looks to be quite anem ic as well.  In particular, another sub stantial de cline in cap ital spending sh ould la rgely of fset the positiv e effects of the tax rebate and consum er spending.  We continue to  think the m ost likely scenario has growth returning to its potential by the s econd half of next year but we certainly can’t ru le ou t a worse 8/21/01 20 scenario. As our business contacts keep repe ating, consum er spending and housing activity m ay falter before the inventory and capital spendi ng adjustm ents are com pleted.  The outlook for world growth has deteriorated, signs of econom ic instability ar e evident in parts of Latin America and Asia, and the intern ational situation could erode fu rther.  For the long term, I remain somewhat concerned about  inflation, but for now the risk s still seem tilted decidedly to the downside.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, the econom ic clim ate in the T welfth District has turned negative as the high-tech downturn has intensified and spilled over in to other sectors.  During the three m onths ending in July, Dist rict em ploym ent cont racted 0.3 percent at an annual rate for a net loss of about 19,000 jobs. Downsizing am ong technology firm s was especially pronounced.  Between May and July, employm ent at high-t ech m anufacturers and business service f irms combined fe ll by about 8 percent at an annual rate , substantially above th e pace of contraction during the first four m onths of the year.  The intensity of the cutback s among District technology firms has be gun to drag down e mploym ent growth in  other sectors.  Employm ent contracted in construction and also fell in shipping, trucki ng, and warehousing during the three m onths ending in July. And job gains in retail and wholesale trade have s lowed to  an an emic pace.  The general impact of the technology-driven downturn is ev ident in the District’s high-tech centers.  For exam ple, the San Francisco Bay area has lost alm ost 35,000 jobs in the past four m onths, as both tech and non-tech em ployers have scaled back.  Employm ent in Portland and Phoenix also has contracted in recen t months and job  growth in S eattle has slowed substan tially.  In general, the technology-driven downturn has dr amatically altered the regional pattern of growth in the District this year, with la st year’s fast-growing areas either contracting or moving laterally. 8/21/01 21Turning to energy m arkets, cooler temp eratures, sluggish econom ic activity, and continued conservation have reduced  electricity usage in California  in recent weeks, easing the demand and supply im balance that has plagued the state for most of the year.  Better market conditions and lower natural gas prices have resu lted in wholesale spot electricity prices of around $50 per m egawa tt hour in m id-August, well below the $200 average recorded for May.  While lower wholesale prices ge nerally are good news for Californi a, the declines  are not likely to reverse the trend in re tail rate hikes that took effect in J une.  A num ber of factors will keep those rates up. The California Departm ent of Wat er Resources, which currently is purchasing electricity for California’s m ajor utilities, needs the revenue to cover past  costs and what have turned out to be relatively high prices on long-te rm contracts.  And th e public utilities want assurances that retail rates w ill allow  them  to recoup past los ses in add ition to covering costs going forward. Right now concern on the part of utilities ove r the adequa cy of the curr ent ra te structure is holding up the issuan ce of $12.5 billion in revenue bonds  meant to repay the state for the billion s of dollars th e Departm ent of Water Re sources h as spent on elec tricity th is year.  At this point, it looks as if the bonds  will not be issued before Oc tober or even Nove mber.  Given the delay in issuance, ca sh flow constra ints like ly will lead th e state to issue revenue a nticipation bonds. The state controller has indicated that these bonds, which would be issued after Labor Day, could amount to $5.7 billion. Turning to the national econom y, the  industrial output and retail sales reports for July fair to say th at the recen t data taken together sh ow few, if any, signs of a pickup in activity.  Our best guess is for growth of around 1 percent in the curr ent quarter.  After that, several factors should operate at about the sam e time to stim ulate faster growth, including the stim ulus from 8/21/01 22 monetary policy and a tax cut that has turned out to be tim ed alm ost perfectly.  We should have a better idea of how much of an effect it is havi ng on consum er spending by our next m eeting.  In addition, the substantial turnaround in energy prices this year should help to prom ote a pickup in activ ity.  For next year our forecast, which like th e Greenb ook assum es no further change in th e funds rate, shows real G DP growth increasing to  more acceptable rates of  around 3 percent.  Of course, there are som e notable downside risks in  the econom y, having to do especially with consum er spending and developm ents abroad.  Overall, our f orecas t would leave labor and product m arkets about in line with  their average long-r un utilization levels and there would be little upward or downward pressure on inflation ne xt year.  We are looking for inflation in the core PCE price index of just below 2 percent both this year and next .  While it’s obviously good that we don’t appear to be facing rising inflationary  pressures, I think it’s  also worth noting that the current period of slow growth could be com pleted without the kind of reduction in inflation that often accom panies such periods.  This out come would be disappoin ting since I certainly would like to see a further m odest decline in  inflation over tim e.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an. Well, what a difference six weeks make!  Or maybe I should say what a difference on e additional m onth of data and som e revisions of past data m ake.  You will r ecall th at New England’s head line econom ic data had been a bit better than those for the nation as a whole, though anecdotes from  regional businesses had been turning increasingly gloom y.  That gloom  seems now  to be ju stified.  With the state and regional employm ent data that were released last Frid ay, the region looks considerably different, with levels of employm ent declining m onth to m onth a nd year-over-year growth at a fraction of its 8/21/01 23 long-term  trend.  The unem ploym ent rate also tipped up from m onth to month by 0.3 percentage point. Add to that the escalating costs in th e Boston m etropolitan area and the fact that the anecdotes have turned from  gloom y to alm ost ugly and we have a region that no longer appears to be Teflon coated. Where is the downturn  occu rring ?  In the usual p laces--p rimarily manufacturing, particularly high -tech m anufacturing, though retaile rs also describe consum er activ ity as anemic.  Several them es run through our discussions w ith m anufacturers.  First, most in the high-tech arena are convinced now  that the turnaround is not likel y to com e anyti me soon.  Some firms don' t expect a resu mption of  "norm al" activ ity, however  that is def ined righ t now, until the second half of 2002. In the face of weak dem and and no sig ns of a pickup, the em phasis is on reducing costs. Even the unusual firm that con tinues to do well is being much m ore cautious on the cost side. Businesses of a ll sizes are putting enorm ous pre ssure on their supply chains.  We've heard  this before but dem ands for pr ice co ncessions reporte dly hav e accelerated. The second them e has to do with IT spending.  Almost all high-tech m anufacturers noted tha t one major rea son IT spen ding will p ick up only ve ry slowly is that m any com panies are quite a ways from  growing in to the inf rastructure they a lready own.  Also, obsolescence is being carefully m anaged.  Desktops, once obsolete in  two years, can be left in place for five years. One of the Bank's direc tors referred to th is as a lack o f “kille r app s.”  That is, in the face of slow de mand, considerable IT investm ent alrea dy in place, as well as cost pressures, the new technology that will driv e new spending has yet to surface an d may well be greeted with som e skepticism  when it does . Finally, am ong both large and sm all firm s the availability of bank credit has becom e a concern. Even when firm s have found financ ing in the bond m arket not much of a problem , 8/21/01 24 they’ve s een credit m arket difficulties im pact partner com panies and joint ventures and have experienced dif ficultie s in renewing their own re volving c redit arrang ements.  Big f irms with lower credit ratings are reportedly shut out of credit m arkets and smaller healthy firms are facing higher rates. There are a few brighter spot s in the region.  Residential construction and real estate addition, labor m arket tightness has eased.  This s eems to be helping area firm s keep costs in check, as there is m uch less upward pressure on compensation.  Firm s that are still hiring say they are able to be m uch more selective; it is easi er to get new hires, and th e recruits are of better calib er. Turning to the nation, I think it is possible to read the current econom y in two ways.  First, som e data m ay be in the process of plateau ing.  Employm ent levels seem  to be declining at a slower rate. And perhaps som e comfort can be taken in the single m onth of flat, not declining, industrial production. Consum er sentim ent is hanging in there, as are resi dential investm ent and consum er spending.  Businesses are continuing to work on increasing productivity largely by reducing costs, and they have reacted to profit pressures by di gging in, not by raising prices. Indeed, at least one source of cost pressures, energy prices, has provided som e relief already and should continue to do so going forward. No one knows when high-tech spending will pick up, but one gets the sense that a huge  prem ium is being put on using existing capital to its fullest, which augurs well for future productivity. Looking back over the postwar period, it' s unusual to find tw o or m ore quarters of GDP growth at m ore than 1 percentage point below potential without a recession occu rring either immediately or one or tw o quarters later.  Arguabl y, one of the only tim es such a period of slow 8/21/01 25 growth was followed by an enduring pickup wa s in the 1994-95 period, the so-called “soft landing.” With the m onetary ease now in place and whatever m ore is needed and the tax cut as well, this period m ay turn out to be a sim ilar land ing--perhaps not so soft-- prior to the takeoff of business inv estment.  It may be that the econom y, and particularly the co nsumer, will continue to muddle thro ugh until then. Certain ly that's what the Greenbook expects, as does the Boston Fed’s forecast.  Our forecast dyn amics m ay be a little different in reg ard to th e stability of stru ctural produ ctivity and the level of the NAIRU, but the overall forecast is  remarkably sim ilar.  We anticipa te slower growth this year than we had expected earlier, a gradual return to grow th near potential--g rowth at 3 percent or m aybe a bit lowe r by year-end 2002--with an uptick in unem ploym ent not as large as in the Greenbook projection, and easing inflation.  This isn' t a bad outcom e.  In fact, again historically speaking, it would be  unusually positive.  But such  a forecast does require som e confidence in the m ore positiv e readings of  the situation tha t I just de lineated. Obviously, the other way to read the current  situation is to focus on the w orsening profit situation. Unless relieved by slower com pensation growth and damped energy costs, prof it pressures do not bode well for the stock m arket, business investm ent, or job growth.  If consum ers are hit by rapidly rising joblessness, all bets are off on housing, auto sales, and consum ption of services, as a slowdown of  manufacturing spreads and becom es a wider slowdown, and econom ic history repeats itself.  Moreover, the other dark  cloud--the external situation, with slowing growth a nd regional crisis conditions--cannot help m atters.  As I said, the issue is how m uch credibility one gives to th e muddling-through hypothesis.  I com e out on that side, but I think it' s a close call.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Stern. 8/21/01 26

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  As I’ve comm ented before, and it continues to be the case, the District econom y for the m ost part is m oving in lockstep with the national econom y.  The District’s econom y has slowed furthe r, I would judge, but the slowing hasn' t been sharp. As for labor m arket condition s, reported j ob vacancies are still co nsiderab le but they are shrinking, and m eanwhile layoffs ar e increasing.  The weakness is m ost visibly concentrated in the m anufac turing and mining sectors, and particip ants in thos e secto rs are not expecting any material im provem ent until som etime next yea r. Both housing and nonresidential construction ac tivity in our Distri ct remain healthy and positive at the m oment, although I think the s eeds of some slowing are clearly visible now.  Vacancy rates in comm ercial space are rising.  So while there is a lo t of current activity, the rising v acancies will weigh on prosp ects for futu re projects.  And while hom ebuilding  activ ity and sales also rem ain healthy, at the upper end of the m arket the pace of sales is clearly slowing. As has been the case for several m onths now, consum er spending and tourism  activity are at best m ediocre.  One exception, where things ar e a little better, is apparel sales.  Why that' s the cas e, I’v e been unable to determ ine.  But pe ople in that business seem to be pleasantly surprised with the s ales they' ve been experiencin g. One of the two bright spots in  the District is the energy sector which, of course, has benefited from  price changes.  The other is agriculture, where--in pa rts of the District that have not been plagued by drought--farm ers clearly ar e going to get both good crops and better prices than they had earlier expected. And we are hearing som e scattered reports about spending on durable goods by producers in those sect ors for which prospects are looking up. As far as the national econom y is concerne d, I don' t know that I would use the term glum , but I find m yself in substantial agreem ent with the Greenbook forecast.  I believe that real 8/21/01 27 improvem ent in th e pace of econom ic activ ity is still som e time off and I think the im provem ent is lik ely to b e anem ic, at leas t initia lly, when  it occurs.  I'm hard pressed to identify any significan t positive surp rises in the la test b atch of  macroecon omic data th at we have received.  And the international s ituation is worse than I had anticipated earli er bo th because g rowth abroad seem s more sluggish than I had expected and beca use the recent decline in the dollar raises at least a yellow flag in m y mind.  I agree that it' s too early to reach any firm conclusions about what that m ight portend but it does suggest to m e that we should be paying at least som e attention to developm ents on the international front. I've comm ented bef ore and I th ink it' s still the c ase tha t the inventory co rrection process has a ways to go. As best I can judge with the benefit of hinds ight, we clearly had a capital spending bubble that has now  collapsed.  And that' s not som ething that m onetary policy is inhe rently  well positio ned to deal with.   If I wanted to be a bit m ore positive--and I think there' s som ething to this --there may be reasons to believe that consum er spending will hold up as long as the rise in unem ploym ent from  this point is not too drastic.  In that re gard, I take som e com fort in what' s going on in the housing m arket.  Sales of both new and existing ho mes have been quite healthy for a long period of tim e and, after all, the purchas e of a house is a long-term  comm itment that people are willing to make.  Now, this m ay involve som e asse t reallocation, and obviously  interest rates are favorable. Nevertheles s, the fact th at people ar e willing to u ndertak e tho se kinds of long-term comm itments at the pace that has prevailed in rece nt months is a developm ent I view as positive. Finally, I am com fortable w ith the Greenbook' s relatively fa vorable inflation outlook.  But in m y view, what we now know about both pr oductivity and com pensation suggests that the profit outlook is clearly negativ e. 8/21/01 28

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Last time I reported that the head of m y regional econom ics group had suggest ed that it looked as if it was going to be a “bummer of a summer.” Unless you’re a hom ebuilder in our re gion, he was about right.  I'm finding it harder and harder to find just the right adjectives to  describe the degree of  slowing that we are observing in our area. While I had hoped to be seeing at least a few m ore positive signs by now, the overall situation is not m aterially different than at the tim e of our last m eeting. Let m e highlight a few recent developm ents.  One strikingly common story now emerging to explain what is keeping sales growth  at least m odestly posit ive can be summed up in one word--discounting. All the an ecdotal reports on retail sales, auto sales, tourism , hotel occupancy, cruise bookings, and ai rline traffic indicate that deep  discounting is being used to bolster sales, with obvious im plications for prices and profitability.  Let m e cite just a couple of exam ples to underscore that point.  Hotel r ooms in Orlando near Disney World can now be booked for $40 a day. Delta Airlines senior executives tell me that  while deep discount leisure traveling is holding up well, ther e is a substantial drop-off in business travel, which com bined with higher energy prices com pared with 1999 and 2000 is causing thei r negative returns.  Trucking f irms are repor tedly eng aged in cutthroa t com petitio n, slashing m ileage charges to ge t freight business. And concern is now  being e xpressed that a significan t number of trucking company failures s eems all bu t certa in.  Of course, retailers and auto dealers have been resorting to sales discount program s and rebate s to liquidate excess inventories. We are also getting m ore and m ore reports that co mpanies are cu tting perks and other discre tionary expenses to protec t profits.  Cuts ar e even hittin g executive enter tainm ent.  Some of you m ay know that bird hunting is one of the lo ngtim e favorite sports of good old boy executives 8/21/01 29 in the South ; it’s a favorite execu tive ritu al when it  com es to entertainm ent.  One of the preferred places to go quail hun ting is a plantation in Flo rida that caters to execu tives of Fortune 500 companies.  Occupancy rates at that plantation ty pically run 98 or 99 perc ent and reservations are booked a year in advance. Cancellation rates for repeat custom ers usually are less than 6 percent. But this year I' m told that cancellations have near ly doubled to 12 percent and are reportedly com ing from  cutbacks by steel and chem ical industry executives and their guests.  Of course, those two segm ents have been am ong the  poorest perform ers and those industries have been particu larly advers ely affected  by the appreciation of the dollar. While it' s true that growth has slowed, it’s also true that growth is decidedly m ore uneven across industries and am ong di fferent states in our region.  Florida' s econom y is both the largest and strongest and Geor gia is holding its own, while Te nnessee, Mississippi, A labam a, and Louisiana are suffering. Tennessee is experi encing another year of very serious budget problem s and the governor and the legislature can 't agree on a budget again this year.  Someone recen tly remarked in frus tration th at Tennessee is fast becom ing the Argentina of the United States. The District continues to s ee contraction in technology jobs.  This has resulted in additional comm ercial lease space com ing back  on the m arket, adding to an already excess supply. Manufacturing firm s continue to cut jobs ; and this is especially hurting Mississippi, whose econom y is m ore manufacturing depende nt than o ther states in the District. Finally, there are indications that our aggressive policy ea sing m oves have had very little im pact on business investm ent spending.  At the sam e time, companies such as Delta Airlines and som e of our trucking contacts indicate that they have  not curtailed their investm ent plans sign ificantly in te rms of canceling orders for new planes or ve hicles.  In fact they say they 8/21/01 30 are using this period of s low sales to accelerat e the retirem ent of older equipm ent, which suggests to m e that the existing stock is becom ing m ore efficient.  A sim ilar story holds for utilities in th e Southeas t, whos e investm ent plans have not been  affected so m uch by rates; however, they have accelerated the phase-out of older plants.  More utility capacity is being brought in to place than is warranted by prosp ective new demand, reporte dly because regulatory constraints are less than in the W est. Not all is bad, however. Besides the relative strength in  single-fam ily housing, we’re beginning to pick up som e hints--and I em phasize that these are only h ints--th at the d eclin e in activity m ay have begun to bottom  out.  Some banker s, for example, are re porting that their older and m ore tradition al customers are beginning to consider new spending an d are m aking inquiries at least about the possibil ity for additional funding. On the national front, it' s easy to becom e impatient waiting for our previous policy moves to have their desired effects. One has to be concerned about th e uncertainty regarding where the fo recasted reb ound in GDP, which as others hav e said is b eing pushed back to the first and second quarters of next year, will actually com e from .  Clearly, with capacity utilization continuing to fall, investm ent--except perhaps in vestm ent in new power generation--is unlikely to make a sharp rebound.  Nor does a rebound in inve ntory investm ent seem imminent.  It’s also hard to im agine a sudden spurt in consum er spending, which is already reasonably healthy relative to the underlying  funda mentals.  Finally, given the slowdown abroad, m uch of which is itself a fallout from  the pause in our own economy, we can’t expect m uch help from  the foreign sector. My conclusion is that the risks rem ain on the downside.  The recovery appears to be more gradual than we had hoped and is not like ly to be led by any one particular sector. This brings m e to m y policy concerns.  The near-term  outlook is still not pretty and a 8/21/01 31 good case can, and I’m  sure will, be m ade for fu rther easing.  At the sam e time, I think a good case can be m ade for patience and caution.  I remain bothered by the rapid growth in the monetary aggregates, which is not fully explaina ble.  And I believe that  we have already put sufficient liquidity into the system  to support sustainable consum er de mand and to bring the econom y back to a desirable growth  rate without too m uch inflati on risk.  But m y fear is that we’ll ge t trapped into f ollowing an implicit po licy rule that s ays we’ll k eep cutting ra tes until the real economy turns around. That is not what I believe we should do fo r two reasons.  First, as we have all reminded ourselves as w ell as others, m onetary  policy is a blunt instrum ent.  Accordingly, succum bing to the tem ptation to try to adjust pr oblem s in one segm ent of the econom y--in this case high-tech and other business investm ent--may in fact over-s timulate other sectors, causing additional imbalances to appear. I interpret the su rge in hom e prices over the last year as an indication that consum ers’ liquid funds ha ve been shifted toward that sector. Second, I’m also concerned that  a lower federal f unds rate and considerable liquidity in the banking system  have added to the high pr oportion of loans leverage d by housing collateral.  This lending has been stimulated by the percei ved high value of ho mes an d the lower rates on home equity loans.  Lowering rates further m ay simply encourage m ore hom e equity lending and more sub-prim e lending to m arginal borrowers m ost at risk to lose their jobs should the downside ris ks in the eco nomy materializ e.  In sh ort, I be lieve there is rea l risk of  puttin g too much ease in the system. And I fear, as others  have already suggested, that circum stances m ay make it diffi cult to reverse course  quickly.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

MR. SANTOMERO. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  As the econom y transitions from  a 8/21/01 32 period of unacceptably slow growth to a m ore reas onable pace of activity,  we should expect to see the d ata shif t from predom inantly bad news to a mixture of  som e positive and som e negative observations on the state of the economy.  This ought to be true  at both the regional and the national levels. I can report that this is what has char acterized our District over the last couple of months. But the ratio of good news to bad news  is not im proving as quickly as I had hoped.  When we met in May, I was able to report a sl owly im proving condition in the Third District.  Since then the news has been decidedly m ixed a nd indeed less positive than expected.  Our June indices of econom ic activity rem ained flat in Pe nnsylvania and turned down in New Jersey and Delaware. Our business outlook survey of m anufacturers in our region, which had improved in average workweek all to ok a turn for the worse th is month, while the index of shipm ents showed only a slight im prove ment but rem ained negative.  Our m anufacturers continue to pare inve ntories and they do not see the inventory correction ending soon. They expect  to continue cutting inventorie s over the next six months.  In contrast, our survey of retailers and other non-m anufacturing firm s shows that they have successfully worked off any inventory overhang. Yet they rem ain vigilant in their ordering to avoid a return to excess inventories. In a sp ecial question, we asked our respondents to what extent the high value of the dolla r had affected th eir bus iness es.  Alm ost half of the firm s reported that they had been hurt by the dollar’s strength, and 18 pe rcent said significantly so.   Labor m arket conditions in the region have weakened som ewhat.  Payroll em ploym ent edged down in the second quarter in the three st ates in our District.  The unem ploym ent rate moved up but rem ains below that for the nation.  Retail sales, excluding autos, were flat in July.  Residential real estate markets rem ained act ive, although the sales of both new and existing 8/21/01 33 homes have been runnin g below last year’s p ace.  Our bankers report that residen tial mortgage refinancing activ ity remains a t a fairly high level and that they are actively seeking new business borrowers among well-capitalized firm s.  Loan quality rem ains relatively good.   The m ixed news has caused people to re-evalu ate their expectations about the future.  Optim ism about the outlook has turned down a bit,  with business contac ts anticipating slow improve ment at best during the rest of the year.  Our staff’s view contin ues to be that regional econom ic growth will pick up som ewhat toward  the end of the year bu t that the p ickup m ight come later than previously thought. Our view on the national econom y is sim ilar.  Manufacturing rem ains weak as does the broad technology sector. Neither situation is likely to im prove soon.  By contrast, the housing m arket rem ains robust and consum er spe nding rem ains m oderate to good.  And there are signs that labor m arket conditions have stab ilized .  The recen t data revis ions help reco ncile som e of what we see in the econom y:  The substantia lly faster growth of labor compensation than previously thought helps to expl ain the ability of consum ers to  continue spending; and the downward revision of profits helps to e xplain the retrenchm ent in investm ent. On the downside, th e econom ic situ ation ab road has deterio rated s ince o ur last meeting.  In many places in the world , econom ic conditions are proving to be m ore problem atic than expected and clearly less conducive to a world recovery than I would like.  Given the interdependent nature of our economies, we m ust remain cognizant of these external f actors and their possible im plications for U.S.  econom ic activity going forward.   We know that we should only now be feeli ng the first 100 basis points of easing we put in place in January, given the la gs in the effects of m onetary po licy.  It’s too soon  to see the effects of the additional 175 basis po ints that came later in the year .  Likewise, the fiscal stim ulus 8/21/01 34 is only now beginning to com e on line.  Tax rebate  checks started arriving in July, with further tax cuts to com e later.  This plus the fact that the data com e in with a lag suggest that it’s not unreasonab le that the in dicato rs are giving us a m ixed view of the economy at this point.  That said, I m ust adm it that midway throu gh the th ird quarter I would feel m ore comfortable if I could point to s ome definitive positiv e sign s that a turn around in th e econom y is under way.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, the Tenth District’s economy continues weak.  Manufacturing rem ains in a slum p in our area .  According to our Bank’s most recent manufacturing survey, activity declined again in July, m oving well below year-ago levels.  Inventories were also down substantially and a significant fraction of firms said they plan to continue reducing inventories over the next six months.  One bri ght spo t is that the ca pital spending projections did not deteriorate further.   Consum er spending held steady in most of our District, as it has elsewhere in the nation. I continue to hear th at consum ers are becom ing increa singly value conscious, though, so discount stores are enjoying the stronger sales at  the expense of other retailers.  Residential construction rem ains stable.  Hom e sales are soli d in m ost of our cities,  although inventories of unsold homes are creeping up. Throughout the Dist rict there is weakness in the demand for high-priced hom es, though, and that  is telling in som e areas, pa rticularly Denver.  Commercial real estate is showing signs of softening further.  Office vacancy rates continue to rise in both Denver and Kansas City, as businesses in both citie s cut back on their expansion plans.  There is still a substantial am ount of construction in th e pipeline but the surge in vacancies is causing developers to have som e second thoughts.   The energy sector rem ains a bright spot in our  District.  Even with  the recent easing in 8/21/01 35 oil and gas prices, the rig count grew again in July.  Labor m arkets have eased further.  Layoff announcem ents rem ain high, although they have co me down a bit from  earlier in the year.  Reflecting the sluggish econom y, infl ationary pressures continue to subside in our area.  Only one of the employers we contac ted said that it had grante d above-norm al wage increases recen tly. As m entioned earlier by President Stern, conditions in the farm econom y have improved.  That sector has been helped not onl y by som e price increases but also by the recen t package that was approved for aid to the farm industry.  Our projections now show that farm incom e on the national level will increase about 9 percent this year, so som e spending should accom pany that.   Let m e turn to m y views  on the national outlook.  It is notewo rthy that while we continue to adjust our outlook-- both the value and the tim e horizon--our staff as well as the Greenbook s taff still see as the m ost likely ou tcome that the econom y should strengthen toward potential over the next few quarter s.  Therefore, it strik es me that the is sue is:  Do we continue with the cu rrent easy po licy or do we ease further at this tim e?  I say policy is easy as we m ight measure it, using m onetary growth and the real  fed funds rate com pared to the equilibrium natural rate that has been estim ated.  I would add that from  what I can tell, our last generation of experiences suggests that it takes about four to five quarters from the start of an easing period for the easing to have an im pact that we  can see in term s of GDP growth.   This suggests that we are probably on track toward elim inating the cyclical weaknesses that now exist. But in our view of the outlook, we obviously have som e rather serious risks. The incoming data  are clearly m ixed and it’s hard  to do nothing when the data are mixed.  I would add that the fo reign sector is weaker--and w eaker th an many had anticipated- -8/21/01 36 and that m ost certainly adds to the downside ri sks for us to consider.  I think all this is complicated to a degree by the difficulty of sepa rating out the structural  factors in our econom y that are weak--and will s tay weak reg ardles s of our short-term  mone tary po licy--from  the cyclical factors. So in som e ways our difficulty  today is to d etermine wh ether we are being--if I

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Jordan.

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  First, a note on agriculture :  Corn crops in the region are com ing in very str ong, as evidenced in the last c ouple of weeks by roadside signs offering a dozen ears of fresh picked corn for 50 cents.  I thought that wa s a real bargain until I went across Lake Erie to Ontario and saw outside a store larg e crates  of corn with a sign that said “Free fresh picked corn. Take all you want.”  [Laughter] I don’t know what the purchasing power parity of this m eans! A year ago at this tim e we were hearing m ore quickly about weakness in the area that we serve than I think was the case in other parts of the country.  That m ay have been a reflection of the rising energy prices; we are very energy inte nsive in m any ways in a lot of our sectors and industries. And other factors were  at work, certainly in the case of metals.  I didn’t go back to check but I don’t recall that our Beig e Book descri ption of conditions in the District was as negative as what I was hearing fr om directors and advisory counc il members at that tim e.  But this tim e I did look at our Beige Book to com pare it with the reports I was getting from our directors and advisory councils, a nd it seem ed a bit out of sync.  So at the beginning of August I sent a letter to all current Sm all Business A dvisory Council m embers and to about 15 or so former members who are in m anufact uring com panies and nonresidential construction to try to get a sense of their views. All of the responses w ere com ing in la st week and we also m et then 8/21/01 37 with our dir ectors.  The assessm ent of  condition s in the Dis trict by thes e contac ts wa s not as negativ e as our Beige B ook report.  Certain ly, portions of manufacturing  in the Dis trict are still weak. Some of the big com panies like Tim ken and Diebold are still reporting weakness.  But a lot of the sm aller firm s are not.  Outside of m etals, the tone was m uch m ore upbeat than what I had been hearing. We contacted every m otor vehicle as sembly plant in th e Distr ict, including those for trucks, as well as every parts supplier and as ked:  “How does it look, coming into the second half?” Ford is very weak--For d kept several plants idle, m ainly those producing commercial vans and m inivans--but the rest  are strong.  Toyota and Honda ar e running flat out, well above last year; and both GM and Chrysl er are operating at levels above  last year and they rem ain optim istic.  So at least from  our District’s perspective, the m otor vehicle sector doesn’t look as negative as the Board staff is assum ing in its forecast. Because of the articles I m entioned last ti me about the co rrugated box ind ustry being a leading indicator, we also cont acted 14 corrugated box suppliers in  the District and asked how things look. Those that supply m ainly consum er product com panies in the District, such as Proctor and Ga mble, are doing quite well.  Those that supply moto r vehicles or m etals-related industries or tech firm s are not doing nearly as well, and certai nly not as w ell as last year.  Construction is still strong in our region. Residential construction, of course, is very strong everywhere, but our contac ts in the nonresidential sector  say that public works and utilities also are continuing to  expand.  In Kentucky our contacts report about a 5 percent increase for the first half  of the year versus  a year ago.  In Western Ohio and Indiana, nonresiden tial cons truction is up 15 percen t from  a year ag o.  Our contacts no ted th at multi-family housing--well, that does get into resident ial--was especially strong, up 40 percent.  But 8/21/01 38 they say it' s the hea lth-care se ctor th at is p roviding them  with a lot of new contracts.  As for other nonresidential construction, such as highw ay and bridge construc tion, several companies say that their problem  is just a m atter of getting labor to f ulfill their c ontracts.  Mostly their complaints are about the lack of skilled labor to operate the type  of construction equipm ent that they are now e mploying. A producer of air curtains in W estern Pennsyl vania inform ed us that July was the best month in the com pany's history by a big m argin; both dom estic and foreign dem and ha s been strong. We also contacted a com pany that produces  controls for industrial motors and supplies to firms throughout the United States as well as ar ound the world.  Their story m ay be more a comment on technology and what' s in store for futu re capital spending rather than just general business. Our contacts said that for the firs t half of the year th eir business was up over 30 percen t vers us a year ag o.  They attribute that to  the fact th at they im plemented an e-b usiness on -line ordering system  that has allowed them  to increase their productivity  since the beginning of 2000 by about 25 to 30 percent across all product lin es.  They say that 80 percent of their operations now involve orders th at are com ing in on-line for just -in-tim e delivery.  They have been able to decrease their pr ices across product lines by 7 to 10 percent while increasing their profit m argins and they have been expanding th eir workforce because of  the strength  of their business. Their exp ectation is that they won' t be able to sustain all of th is because th ey expect their com petitors to im plem ent these sam e kinds  of technolog ies and close the gap th at they believe they now enjoy. Com panies that supply equipm ent for the he alth-care sector say they are doing very well, as are those that are involved in large, highly autom ated, and very expensive coal m ining equipm ent.  The problem for the latter is getting labor to work the very sophisticated coal m ining 8/21/01 39 machinery, som e of whic h cost $5 m illion p er machine.  Business for a co mpany that produces titanium  parts for the aerospace indu stry is up 25 percen t vers us last y ear.  And their s ales of parts to the m edical industry--knee jo ints and that sort of thing--are  up 20 percent.  That firm  has five openings for m achinists but no qualified ap plicants.  Pittsburgh Pl ate Glass sales to the aerospace and housing sectors are strong but sales to the m otor vehicle industry are weak. The retail sector had been very negative but  turned better in early August.  Some of our directors--especially from  Federated and other retailing companies--w ere very bearish.  They are hopeful now that the back-to-school sales ar e going to be better than they had planned for coming into the second half of the year.   Representatives from  the school districts in Nort h Ohio in particular said that they have a lot of unfilled teacher po sition s as th e back-to-sc hool period arriv es--sch ool started last week in our area of the country--and th ey cite aggressive recruiting of Ohio teachers by California schools as one reason. In response, Ohio schools are going to recruit in India.  [Laughter] On the inflation front, tuition is up 9 to 10 per cent at alm ost all of the public colleges and universities in the District. We might be able to justif y som e of the incr eases in m edical care costs as quality im provem ents, but I doubt th at’s true in higher education.  [Laughter] On the national econom y, midway through this third quarter it now appears that from  a broad GDP perspective, the second half is goi ng to be slower than had been hoped at the beginning of  the year.  But it’s notable that two very im portant sectors of the econom y, housing and m otor vehicles, have been considerably stronge r than h ad been expected at the s tart of the year. Moreover, em ploym ent has held up better than expected.  The unemploym ent rate is lower than had been feared. And what appeared to be  a dangerously destabilizi ng situa tion in natu ral gas and electric power six or seven months ago ha s eased dram atically.  Even the current account 8/21/01 40 deficit in the  first ha lf cam e in m uch sm aller th an expected.  Now, it is  true that inventories plunged m uch m ore dram atically th an had been e xpected, bu t that' s not necessarily a bad thing.  We were told that steel inventories are down dram atically because of a 25 percent drop in imports. The biggest m iss in m ost forecasts w as in busin ess fixed inves tment, the sam e catego ry that accoun ted for the tendency of forecaste rs to und erestim ate the streng th in the prior expansion. Risks outside the United  States seem to have intensif ied; Argentina, Japan, and even the euro are a are a ll con siderab le ris ks.  And th ere is no dou bt tha t events will oc cur to which we will have to respond. But the so lutions to those developm ents in advance of their occu rrence are not going to be influenced by whether the U.S. overnig ht interbank rate is a little higher or a little lower. There m ust com e a tim e when we have to  dem onstrate confidence that with pa tienc e the magic of the  marketplace will ag ain produce big ger GDP numbers.  Thank you.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  The Second District econom y has weakened further recently,  while both f inished goods inflation and input cost pressures have continued to recede. Much of  the weakness is s till concentr ated in manufacturing, but other sectors ha ve shown signs of slowing as we ll.  In July, private sector payroll em ploym ent was virtually unchanged in New York State but fell  at roughly a 2 percent pace in New  Jersey.  We can't really allocate th at between To ny Santom ero’s part of New Jersey and m y part of New Jersey, so I think we tend to double cover it, but that' s the fifth straight drop.  While m anufacturing has sustaine d the steep est job losses ov er the past year, weakness in both had been an engine of job growth, has shed j obs at an annual rate of roughly 5 percent since 8/21/01 41 peaking in March. Disconcertingly,  employm ent in New York City' s critical financial services sector has now declined for four consecutive m onths, with virtually daily headlines of very large-scale reductions in staff. Retail sale s were descr ibed as sluggish in June and July, t hough the heat wave in early Retailers continue to report a weak pricing envi ronm ent, with m ost of our respondents indicating that both selling prices  and m erchan dise cos ts are flat to lo wer.  While retail wage pressures reportedly rem ain subdued, contacts continue to note fairly brisk es calation in health benefits and utilities cos ts.  The Buffalo area in New York St ate is particularly weak .  And Siena College’s survey of New York State res idents, which te nds to be reason ably accu rate, reports th at consum er confidence fell sharply in July both upsta te and in the New York City area, more than erasing the gains in May and June. July’s level is  the lowest in the survey’s 2-1/2 year history. Construction and real estate activity have been mixed.  The comm ercial s ector rem ains sluggish and pockets of weakness have em erged in the residential segm ent, but the tone rem ains rather positive, considering that. Manufacturer s and purchasing managers report that business conditions weakened in July, wh ile price pressures receded.  New York City hotel occupancy rates and room  rates fell signifi cantly in the second quarter from  a year ago.  A lot of tourists continue to com e to Ne w York City but they do n't seem to be spending as m uch or staying as long as previously. Inflation in the area recede d in July, m ainly due to a downturn in energy prices, and it is about on a pa r with the national average.  Bankers report steady loan dem and, rising delinquency rates, and tight er credit standards.  Conditions appear to be som ewhat m ore favorable in the residential m ortgage segm ent of t heir business. On the national level, we th ink the near-term  outlook is fo r sluggish grow th at best.  8/21/01 42 We expect that third-quarter grow th could be about 2 percent, but that's putting a lot of  faith in the m onetary policy e asing in the p ipeline and in  the check s com ing from  the U.S. Treasury.  With little d ata so far for the quarter, there is cert ainly a very g reat d eal of uncertainty about th is short-term  growth outlook. Longer term we expect, as does the Gree nbook, that the outlook will brighten som e, with GDP growth rebounding to ove r 2-1/2 percent in Q4 and in 2002.  We have taken a first look at 2003  and it looks  as if growth  will rem ain at about the sam e pace into that year.  That will put growth b elow what we believe is potential, so the unem ploym ent rate will r ise.  We think it will go up to  about 5 percent by th e end of 2002.  We have a rather b enign forecast for inflation.  We expect the PCE deflator to  be about 2-1/4 per cent in 200 2 and to drop down to about 2 percent in 2003. So those who are looking for a minor im provem ent in inflation m ay just have their wish f ulfilled. In the sho rt term  we think that the do wnside risks are quite severe and tha t there really is a significant risk of a recession. Weak household consum ption and aggregate dem and raise the possib ility tha t the in ventory co rrection will last long er an d that bus iness inves tment will exacerb ate that situation .  We could have a vici ous circle that produces a recession in the near term and in the longer term a continuation of the sluggish econom y we 've seen over the past year. On the other hand, the com bination of monetary easing and fiscal policy could have a greater than expected impact, re sulting in a surge in aggregate dem and.  However, we think that prospect is very m uch less likely. Let m e talk briefly about the international situation, particul arly about tw o areas, Asia and Argentina. You m ay have noticed in this  morning' s paper that Chinese Prem ier Zhu was 8/21/01 43 making a tour of southern China.  You m ay remember that Deng Xiaoping announced a m ajor change in policy in China by a tour of southern China.  I think  the m ost signif icant thin g that Prem ier Zhu said is that the Chinese should do an ything to improve their e xports.  Now, if true--and he tends not to say things that he doesn' t mean--that could very well be the last th ing tha t is needed for non-Japan, non-China countries of Asia .  China does not really com pete very m uch with the rest of Asia on tech exports, but tech exports in th at area are already decim ated.  However, the Chinese can clean everybody' s clock in  every other area of exports because the fact is that they can bring their prices  down to wherev er they wan t them  to be and are ab le to com pete at any price level. They sim ply have to m ove a factory 500 m iles farther into interior China and pay close to nothing for the cost of labor. So that plan, if carried forward, is a rather frightening prospect for the already weakened ec onom ies of Asia, the form er “tigers.” On Argentina, by chance in m y State Depa rtment years in the m id-1960s I was in the office of regional econom ic policy and one of th e countries I was supposed to look out for was Argentina. So it' s a place I' ve known reasonably well for almost 40 years.  I think a crisis in Argentina is likely to be signifi cantly different from m ost cris es.  If it would rem ind us of anything, it would be closer to what  we’ve seen in Indonesia.  The reason is this: The currency board was n ot brought in by President Menem  because som e econom ics professor to ld him  that it was an im portan t piece o f econom ic theory.  He brought it in because he inherited abo ut 5,000 percent annual inflation. His predecessor had to leave office ear ly as soon as Menem’s election was certified. So Menem brought in the currency  board because he realized, as a brilliant politician, that he had to im port discipline in order to get Argen tina functioning.  But he engaged in a kind of wishful thinking in hoping that at  som e stage the econom ic stars would align them selves so that Argentina could get out of the convertibility arrangem ent and the peso would 8/21/01 44 strengthen. Well, that never quite happened. My concern is that if the present regim e collap ses, which it well m ight, we' re not going to see a Brazilian-typ e situation where the cu rrency undergoes a significant devaluation and the social situation m anage s itself reasonably well.  I fear that we will se e something that is truly ch aotic, with rioting in the s treets and a v ery unpredictable outcom e in the congr essional elections in October. Now, one of the things that Argentina is  extraordinar ily good at is blam ing other people for its problem s.  In the course of the la st week they’v e already set the stage for that. According to the econom ics minister, people in  Washington have been espousing default and devaluation for Argentina. The fact that that is n't true is not enorm ously  relevant.  And if we have a really good-sized problem  in Argentina, I think it is likely to have a m uch bigger effect on the world econom y than the size of the Argen tine econom y would indicate --rather as Russia, with a GDP the size of Norway, did in 1998. To m e the real downside risk is that, despite the greatest possible intentions of everybody involved to help A rgentina yet again, if it is deem ed not to have worked there will be questions--in this b ackground of a very weak econom y--about the quality of the financial/econom ic leadership in the world.  Now once again, that would probably be a bad assessm ent.  There' s nothing wrong with the quality of econom ic manage ment in the world. But with this very weak econ omic clim ate, if that perception were  real, I think we could have som e very chaotic f inancial m arkets.  Of course, that is not som ething we can anticipate through m onetary policy.  However, I think what we ought to do with monetary policy today is rather clear. And in the very short period ahead, I believe w e could have som e very serious damage control requirements com ing our way.  Thank you.

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I think th e Comm ittee is faced with 8/21/01 45 the question of whether or not to accept and adopt the Greenb ook's baseline forecast, which frankly, given where we are starting is a relatively  attractive forecas t.  It points to a retu rn of the econom y to its downwardly rev ised potential g rowth for the forecast horizon, with PCE inflation remaining contained.  Optimists--indeed som e peopl e at this table--have already po inted to som e tentative sig ns that the econom y has bottom ed.  One of those relatively p ositive sign s is the trend in first-tim e claim s for unem ploym ent bene fits, which have fallen below  400,000 for four consecutive weeks. Others have pointed to homebuilding, which as m easured by housing starts rose at the f astest pace in 17 m onths .  It is tru e also that retail  sales cam e in surprisingly strong when adjusted f or falling gasolin e prices.  And o ur own IP data can b e and have bee n read by some as indicating that industrial production has begun to stabilize.  Unfortunately, I do not think any of these data, particula rly given the f act that they ar e only one m onth’s worth, have been sufficiently st rong to be indicative of a bottom ing much less a likely return to m ore robust growth.  They ar e certainly not strong enough to give us m uch comfort or to support the view that we should do nothing at this m eeting.  An outcom e such as the baseline is actually more hope  than reality at this stage, and in m aking policy I think we would be well advised to put significant odds  on an adverse outcom e for a ggregate dem and, particularly capital spending. Some of the evidence in that direction includes our own Beige Book, which indicates on going weakness, as well as the staff’s forecast, w hich was ag ain rev ised down in the face of weaker than  expected in coming data.  Though consum er spending has been a bastion of strength, as others have noted, m ounting job losses and a declining stock m arket perform ance could indeed threaten to weaken co nsum er behavior.  The profit outlook is certainly not yet firm , which indicates that business investm ent is unlikely to return to robust growth in the near to inte rmediate ter m and indee d may weaken further.  While businesses have 8/21/01 46 opportunistically liquefied their ba lance sheets, the dem and for loans is off, again suggesting that businesses sense no need to invest for an uptur n in future dem and.  And our earlier concerns about weakness overseas are clearly starting to m aterialize, in part due to  weakness here and in part due to the general high-tech retrenchm ent that is influenci ng a large num ber of econom ies.  In my view the forecast o f a turnarou nd overseas  is again based m ore on a question of what should be as opposed to what appears likely. In the face o f all this weakness and the sense that the risks, at least in m y mind, are to the downside, som e have argued that we shoul d probably do nothing.  There could be a num ber of reasons adduced for not res ponding to the recent data, whic h have been weaker than we expected, or for not responding to the downward adjustm ents in the forecast.  One of those reasons is that policy works with long lags and w e might be stoking the fires of future inflation.  We cannot be com placent here, bu t for the risk of future inflation to become an imm ediate and overriding policy concern today we must believe th at one of two states is going to em erge.   The first of those states is that the econo my is going to rebound so quickly that we’ll be unable to adjust policy, which would im ply either that we won’t be able to read the incom ing data or that we won' t have the fortitude to resp ond to them .  I think bo th of those things are unlikely. The second state that would warrant favoring no policy action t oday is that we are worried th at the labo r market tight ness we have seen is not likel y to abate and we believe that inflation is g oing to rise even in th e face of be low-trend g rowth.  Now the extrem e version of this view is so-called stagflation. I think we' ve had only one case of stagflation, and that one case was driven b y a surprise increase in o il prices.  So it seem s that we are un likely to face great stagflation risks because I believe we’re unlikely to get a surp rise on the o il price front or any other shock that would throw th e econom y way off in term s of creating pressures for a sudden 8/21/01 47 uptick in inflation. A third risk is  that inflation might pick up gra dually over tim e.  At this stage that s eems to m e far less  of a policy concern than that weak ness itself will becom e more widespread and longer lasting. Now, there is a second school of argum ent against responding to the incom ing data and the downward revision in the forecas t.  That seco nd school of argum ent says that frequ ent rate changes add  to uncertain ty and that o ur accom panying statem ents create a negative p sychology.  In fact, I think m arkets have bui lt in an expectation of a Fe d easing today and I believe the uncertainty would be greater if we didn' t respond to the incom ing data than if we m oved forward and reduced rates. I would also say that--ra ther than adding to consum er malaise--honest statem ents of a central bank, even if they are not reassuring, build credibility far m ore than would a false sense of optim ism.  So I think it' s quite im portant that our st atem ents reflect reality as we see it and the risks as we understand them . A third argum ent that has been adduced agai nst lowering ra tes at th is meeting is tha t reducing rates over-stim ulates a few sectors.  Again, this  is plausible; in f act, it' s true.  It reflects the fact that interest rate ad justm ents clearly work through th eir im pact on interest-sensitive sectors. When we raise rates, housing is hurt;  when we lower rates, housing is helped.  By influencing asset p rices and activitie s in intere st-sensitive sectors, we influence the entire econom y.  We should not refuse to  act because we do not like th e transm ission m echanism s of monetary policy. If we were to  follow that approach, we woul d obviously be tying both hands behind our backs. I believe th e final argum ent aga inst adjusting rates at th is meeting is tha t we m ay in fact find that rates are to o stim ulative and thus th at we are ov er-stimulating the economy.  In that regard we sh ould recogn ize, as we th ink about th e range of the estim ated equilib rium  real rate, 8/21/01 48 that the actu al equilib rium real rate would gradually go dow n as the econom y weakens.  So the degree of stimulus actually starts  to decrease if we keep ra tes unchanged in the face of a weakening econom y. Let m e conclude by say ing that in my judgm ent the baseline forecast is a hope m ore than a reality, the risks are certainly to the downside, and the argum ents against m oving rates down at this policy m eeting strike m e as far weak er than the argum ents in favor of moving them .

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I'm going to offer a few bits of anecdotal inform ation that com plement things that have al ready been said, but I wi ll try not to duplicate what is already on the table. My UPS and FedE x contacts both reported that m uch of t he world is not doing very well, though they were both fair ly optim istic about Europe.  My UPS contact said that from January to June UPS business in Europe had grown at doubl e-digit ra tes.  Growth was slowing down a bit now, but they  still expe ct it to b e positiv e.  My FedEx contact reported that Europ e was the one area wher e growth continued; he also reported double-digit growth in exports out of Europe and busine ss within Europe.  And he was ve ry optim istic that growth in FedEx business was going to continue at an 8 to 10 percent rate in Europe.  Both companies are trimm ing capital spending som ewhat.  My UPS cont act said that m ajor cutbacks are taking place in the airline industry in general and that cargo segm ents were be ing cut.  From  Taiwan to the United States and from  Japan to the United Stat es, capacity is being cut.  Both com panies reported a s ignificant am ount of substitu tion away from  the prem ium express bus iness into th e more standard shipping business, which woul d be consistent with efforts all around to econom ize. My contact at W al-Mart said  that his com pany’s prelim inary experience with the tax 8/21/01 49 rebates was that about 25 to 30 percent of th e checks cash ed at W al-Mart--W al-Mart is cash ing those checks at no charge--are bei ng spent on the spot at the stores. He also noted that Wal-Mart finds labor m arket conditions still tight f or sales associa tes.  Obviously, th at is a m inimum  wage or slightly above m inimal wage position, and apparently the easi ng of the labor m arket in the higher paid occupations is not show ing up at all in the m arket for sales as sociates.  He said it' s just as difficult as it was a year ago to hire people.  Retention is  up, but they still have problem s filling vacan t positions.  I thought that was rath er interesting.  He also em phasized the pressure that W al-Mart sees from  health -care costs; t hose costs are going to be up 20 to 22 percent this year and the increase m ay be worse next year.  He noted tha t one develop ment in that area is the spread of legislative restric tions that m ake it m ore and m ore difficult for firm s to apply restrictions on pre-existing conditi ons.  So the companies that ha ve relatively generous health-care benefits are finding what I guess m ight be called “ advers e sele ction ” against them .  People who know they have pre-exis ting co nditions w ill try to g ain employm ent in those firm s. On a m ore general note, for m e the issue today is not whether substantial monetary stimulus is in place.  I'm convinced that it is.  The question is not whether that stim ulus is going to have an effect, but when. I think it' s a tim ing issue.  I've been interes ted in the fact that longer-term  interest rates have not  com e down, or have com e down only in the last week or two.  The ten-year rate is s till essentia lly where it was in Decem ber.  It’s very ea sy, using the ten-year strips, to de compose that rate in to various m aturities.  So I put together a table showing the 0 to 2-year part of it, the 2- to 5-year forw ard rate, and the 5- to 10 -year forw ard rate.  Let m e just read you a f ew num bers.  In August of last year, the 5- to 10-year forward rate extracted from  the strips was 5.6 percent. At the end of Dece mber, it was 5.6 percent.  As of Friday, it was 6.0 percent. The 5- to 10-year m aturity has been hanging up there fairly hig h.  What has happened is 8/21/01 50 that the decline we’ve s een in the 10 -year rate is due alm ost entirely to declines in the 0 to 2-year part and m aybe som ewhat to declin es in the 2- to 5-year part. Now, what does one m ake of a situation wh ere the 5- to 10-year forward rate is unaffected by all that has gone on in the last year? Incidentally, before I try to speak to that question, let m e say that a lot of our ideas a bout the lags com e from  experiences where the longer rates do follow the short rates to a very significant extent.  Looking at the historical data, over a six -month period every percentage poin t drop in th e federal funds rate g enerally will b e accom panied by a drop in the 10-year rate of a bout 30 or 35 b asis poin ts; that' s the average experience. So one of the reasons w hy we’re pe rhaps not seeing as m uch result as we m ight expect is that a lot of the e ffect typically is com ing out of housing.  Housing rem ains on a high plateau and mortgage interest rates really haven' t com e down  since December.  There was a substantia l declin e last year but not much this year. I interpr et the maintaine d level of  the 5- to 10-year forward rate--whether it' s high or not is a different m atter--as reflecting a m arket conviction that the longer-run growth potential for the econ omy has not been affected by the events of the last year.  The m arket view is that we are going through a period of adjustment. And af ter all, this is a position that m any people around this table have stated. We have helped to  reinforce that convictio n.  Whether it' s right or not, we don't really know. But I think there are lots of reasons to be optim istic about that. If that view is cor rect, I think it' s logical to expect that the dem and for the technological equipm ent that is necessary for achieving productivity gain s is going to have to resum e.  That dem and is going to res ume becaus e otherwis e we’re not go ing to get th e productivity that is im plied by this outlook for the econom y.  There was over-expansion in that industry and there are som e backlogs to be worked off.  But most of that equipm ent has a rather  8/21/01 51 short useful life. A norm al depreci ation period for a PC is three ye ars or som ething like that.  So the back log is going to b e worked of f and that d emand will b e com ing back.  Suppose that view--our outlook and my interp retation of the m arket’s outlook and why the 5- to 10-year forward rate re mains as high as it is--is not corre ct and potential growth in fact goes back more toward the dreary levels that  we had from , say, 1972 to 1995.  If that happens, then we’re going to end up with a lot m ore inflat ionary pressure than we  currently anticipate.  The reason is that we’re not goi ng to be getting the productivity  growth and there’s a lot of inertia in compensation and wage processes. I just offer those ideas. But I will emphasi ze th at the recen t behavior of the long end of the m arket relative to the short end is a ve ry, very unusual experience.  If you look at the data from  the Korean W ar on--jus t put so me colum ns on a spread sheet--you will conv ince yourself that this is a very, very  unusual period.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  A few meetings ago I made the comment that the econo my was susceptib le to ch ronic and acute risks--the chronic risk of rising inflation and  the acu te ris k of recessio n.  The comm ent drew s ome chuckles and people told m e afterwards that they liked the analog y.  The only problem  is that now, with the wisdom of hindsight, my statem ent doesn’t look so good because the recession risks are also proving to be chronic. For som e months now both official and private forecasters have been projecting that a turnaround in dem and gr owth is imminent, that  the econom y will recover,  and that eco nomic growth will get back on track. While ther e have br ight spo ts this ye ar, for the m ost part th at turnaround just has not m aterialized .  Overall co nditions seem roughly as weak now as they d id earlier in the year, desp ite signi ficant expansionary doses of bot h monetary and fiscal policy and 8/21/01 52 a cut in energy prices. The forecast recovery ha s been pushed  back and pu shed back again; it always seem s to be just around the corner but ne ver quite here.  No doubt at som e point there really will be a turnaround, but our pa tience is being severely tested.   We’ve talked about these points of weakness for several m eetings now and there’s no need to belabor the issues. Probably the m ost serious question  is the p rofits outlook.  Until profit expectations recover, it ’s hard to see a str ong turnaround in business i nvestm ent.  Indeed, the staff showed yesterday that the profits outl ook for technology shares in the S&P index has dropped so rapidly that that por tion of the S&P is again showi ng high price-earnings ratios, possibly foreshadowing more d eclines in stock prices.   The inte rnational s ector is also g rowing in creasingly worrisom e.  There seem s to be no demand growth driver anywhere in the world.  The standard internati onal forecast does show a recovery. But the m ain source of future stre ngth--if we can call it that--in the world econom y seem s to be that the United States has such a high incom e elasticity for imports that if our econom y recovers, it will pull up dem and for our tr ading partners.  One can be forgiven for considering this a rath er weak reed.   The steady beat of disappointing news is taking its toll on expectations--so m uch so that the Beige Book got lots of play in the press a couple of weeks ago, with reports that econom ic malaise was beginning to sp read from  manufacturing to se ctors such as office space, trucking, and shipping services. In som e sense th ese reports were not all that rem arkable; after all, slowdowns would be expected  to spread.  But the nega tive expectations have become so pervasive after these repo rts that the Beige Book had m uch more  impact than it norm ally does.  Even the GDP revisions had an im pact.  As Davi d Wilcox pointed out earlier, the GDP revisions did not change inflation or th e output gaps, so there was no first-order im pact on m onetary 8/21/01 53 policy. But the BEA did write down growth in recen t years, taking a big slice out of both capital investm ent and profits.  The profits change c ould indirectly cause problem s on the dem and side, given the prevailing weakness in profit expectations .  The investm ent change hurts on the supply side, lowering the capital deepeni ng com ponent of productivity chan ge and estim ates of potential growth over the next few  years.  This is not, to  be sure, a true struct ural productivity change because the alteration was due to capital put in place, which we already k new was cyclically weak. But it’s still d isappointing to s ee this prod uctiv ity gro wth spurt th at we all too k such pride in being partly undone with new data. Let m e say a word about lags; a few of you ha ve m entioned those.  Lags for m onetary policy are long. They are also vari able.  It strikes m e that at th is tim e in this cycle it becom es very difficult to read exactly where we are in th e process of monetary la gs.  Long rates--and this is sim ilar to what Bill Po ole jus t said--actually went down last f all bef ore we started lo wering short rates. So if the drop in long rates was going to have som e effect, it should be working through the system  already.  Anot her channel through which monetary  policy works is the dollar.  And as was reported earlier, th e dollar hadn’t really gone down un til a cou ple of weeks ago.  The third channel is equity m arkets.  If anybody knows how to interp ret the equity m arkets, please come forward and say your piece!  So I think that the ques tion of  exactly w here we ar e in this monetary lag cycle is after all rather com plicated .  I think the notion of just saying “Well, we started lowering rates eight m onths  ago, so the effect ought to be com ing through now” is at best oversim plified.  On the f iscal side, w e have ta lked a lot abou t the tax cuts.   But there is  an offsetting factor involved because a lot of states have gotten into fi scal difficulties as a result of the developm ents that are going on throughout the country and som e states  are actually raising taxes, offsetting the Federal tax cut. 8/21/01 54There are still bright spots. Housing has been consistently st rong.  Price-earnings ratios on m ost stocks have been reasonably stab le.  Consum ption, as has been noted, has held up well. The turnaround could still be  right around the corner.  Moreove r, in m y view this has not been a tim e of policy m istakes.  Monetary polic y, as I think most of us would agree, has followed roughly the proper path, getting rates down early and significantly.  But given the prolonged slowdown--which any day we m ight begi n to call chronic--there does seem to be a need for a monetary booster shot. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. The previous Greenbook proj ected som e strengthening in growth in the fourth quarter and a recovery to growth near trend and to a level of output near potential in 2002. And I believ e there was a sense of agreement that if th e forecast st abilized, th at forecast provided a strong case for holding policy unchanged after last m eeting’s move.  On the other hand, the pattern this year has be en a continu ing series of downw ard revisions to the forecast, followed by additional easing m oves in an effort to res tore th e earlier forecast for 200 2.  So the first questions I asked m yself as I prepared  for today’s m eeting were: “H as the forecast stabilized ?” and “Is th e forecast for 2 002 stil l lined up to a reasonable app roxim ation on trend growth and f ull em ployment?”  The a nswers will help m e to assess both th e need f or further easing and the room  to m aneuver--or the thre at of overshooting in eas ing further.   This assessm ent, howe ver, is com plicated, as  David W ilcox noted in his presentation, by the NIPA and productivity revisions. The out look context for m onetary policy decisions in my view is best viewed in term s of growth in actual output relati ve to potential and in term s of utilization rates. From  this perspective, the growth rate s for 2001 and 2002 in the Greenbook forecast were m arked down just abou t in line w ith the staff’s downward re vision to trend growth, 8/21/01 55 thereby virtually replicating th e previous Greenbook’s projecti ons for the unem ployment rate and inflation .  So if the story is s till th at forces are in train th at will m ove the econom y to recovery and that the recovery will put the econom y near full em ploym ent and trend growth next year, it’s h ard to see the need for fu rther easing or the room  to m aneuver. But to te ll the truth, the s tory doesn ’t feel entirely right.  There remains a te nsion between the evidence of persis tent weakness in the incom ing data a nd the story of recovery.  The question we face in each forecast rou nd is how ma ny quarters  lie between the data and the sto ry.  And what we end up doing again and again is insert ing one more quarter that  looks m ore like the previous weak quarters--in this case it’s the fourth quarter of  this year--before we get a transitional quarter or two on the way to trend growth.  At the ve ry least this pattern suggests that there are s ignificantly as ymm etric ris ks on the do wnside.   In assessing how m uch easing is appr opriate and whether we have done enough, another consideration is important .  Declin es in th e federal f unds rate h ave little o r no d irect effect on aggregate demand but are an instru ment for encou raging a m ore accomm odative overall set of financial conditions, as the lowe r short-term  rates pass through to lower longer-term rates, to equity p rices, and the d ollar.  In fact--and this is an issue that President P oole and Governor Gram lich have just commented on--long-te rm rates did not fall from  their levels at the time we began to ease, at least until very recently.  Furtherm ore, equity p rices are sig nificantly lower and the dollar is higher. I asked th e staff to run som e simulations with th e FRB/US model to ass ess the ef fect of the cum ulative easing on overall financial conditions.  First, they began the sim ulations in the first quarter of 2001 and they held th e real federal funds rate constant  in the baseline forecast.  In the alternative scenario, they im posed the path  of the funds rate in the Greenbook through 2002.  8/21/01 56 They ran the alternative s cenario und er two assu mptions.  In the first case, they assum ed the historical regularities for pass-thro ughs to longer-term  interest rates,  equity prices, and the dollar.  In the second, they constrained the latter variables to follow thei r actual paths through the last easing. The results indicated that, assum ing hist orical regularities, there would have been virtually no effect on real GDP through the second  quarter.  But real GDP would have been a percentage point higher by the end of this year  and more than 3  percen tage points higher by the end of 2002. However, given the actual paths of fi nancial variables, the level of real G DP would be only 1/4 percentage point higher at the end of this year and 1/2 percen tage point higher by the end of 2002. That is, instead of providing a power ful stim ulus, the easing only about offset the restrain t coming from declin ing equ ity pr ices an d the appr eciation of  the dolla r, leav ing little n et stimulus from overall financial conditions. The problem with this sim ulation experim ent is that it fails to give the F ed any credit for the decline in interest rates in the second half of 2000 in anticipati on of Fed easing in 2001.  So the staff then redid the sim ulations beginning in  the third quarter of la st year.  By August of last year, the federal funds futures indicated the absence of expectations of any change in the funds rate over the next year. The decline in lo ng-term  rates that followe d reflected expectations of subsequent Fed easing. This approach counts the decline in l ong-term  rates in the second half as part of the stim ulus from  the cumulative easin g.  But the b enefits of  the lower long -term  rates were m ore than offset by the effects of the decline in  equity prices in the se cond half of last year.  So in som ewhat of a surprise, to m e at least,  on net financial conditions  have actually becom e more restrictive rather than  more stimulative if we be gin the accounting from  mid-2000. From  the standpoint of monetary policy stra tegy, this raises the question of whether and how m onetary policy should be  adjusted for variations in the pass-through from  the funds 8/21/01 57 rate to broader financial conditi ons, episode by episode.  If we make our policy judgments on the basis of the forecasts, this adjustm ent would na turally occur.  But it doe s raise a cautio ning note about guidance from  outcome-based policy rules th at in effect are calibrated off average pass -throughs. At any rate, this an alysis suggests so me tension in the forecast.  We all point to monetary policy as one of the forces prom oting r ecovery and yet the analysis shows that at best we m ay be running in place.  To be sure, it also  suggests th at our aggres sive easing h as prevented what otherw ise m ight have been a slide into recession.  However, the reco very in the Greenbook must be based not on im proved fina ncial conditions but on other for ces in play--for exam ple, the effects of lower energy prices, m ore stim ulative fiscal policy, or perhaps more im portantly the natura l forces for recover y that f ollow the end of the inventory correction and the end of the retrenchm ent in high-tech investm ent.   While I worry, therefore, whether we are on the path to recovery, I also worry about overshooting as well. It seem s to me that the dynam ics of expansion suggest an upw ard instability to growth. In the dynam ics of cyclical swings in growth, it’s not that the econom y return s to trend growth after a slowdown or recess ion and stay s there, bu t it natu rally moves to above trend growth. Therefore, once a recovery is under way we may face the twin challenges of moving monetary polic y back to neutrality in a tim ely fashion and contending with above-trend growth at a tim e when inflation is a bit above at least my long-run target and the econom y is already op erating at close to cap acity.  Further easing today  will undoub tedly com plicate that adjustm ent.  But the failure to see traction from  our m oves to date and the resulting downside risks encourage taking som e risk of overshootin g today and leaving to tomorrow the task of returning to neutrality and avoiding the inflationary cons equences of any overshooting. 8/21/01 58

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  As usual, by this tim e our discussion has thoroughly dissected and evaluate d the econom y, and little rem ains to be added.  So please indulge a short-tim er for a few concluding rum inations.   First of all, it’s necessary to acknowledge, as almost everyone here has, significant disappointment in the data that have com e in over the interm eeting period.  The m ain driver of this slowdown, capital overhang drying up capital ex penditures, looks no better.  The inventory correction, to m y great surprise , drags on still.  The world ec onom ic outlook looks even m ore bleak, with political and financia l tensions th reatening to ex acerbate the situation further.  Although housing som ehow continues to lev itate, recen t auto sales m ay be hinting that the consum er is tiring, which could becom e a serious concern.   Not everything is negative, of course.  Industrial production and labor m arket conditions m ay be stabilizing.  The tax rebate checks are flowing, Fed easing should  be kicking in, inventory balance is com ing into view, and energy prices  are falling.  Nevertheless, on balance one must be concerned. At the last m eeting, there was sp eculation that the balance of risks m ight be m oving toward symm etry.  At that time, I expected to be firm ly in that cam p by today. While I am  indeed edging in that directio n, I’m  not ready yet to drive down the tent pegs and settle in. I’d like  to, but I just can’t. Shifting the subject a bit, two strains of recent m edia comm ent strike m e as wrongheaded. First there has been  the suggestion that m onetary policy isn’t working.  Have these people given any thought to what this econom y might look like today if policy had not changed this year?   If anything, I’d suggest that policy has worked  more quickly than usual and precisely where it was needed m ost, shoring up consum er and stock m arket confidence.  And 8/21/01 59 now the trad itional lagge d impact of  policy shou ld star t to be f elt. Second, one is already starting to hear com plaints that a recovery will be weak when it comes.  Here again I wonder if our critics have  pondered the im plicati ons of a strong rebound? Given the ve ry high abso lute level of  activ ity that we have even today, I hope and expect that the recovery will be m oderate.  An early boom  beginning from  here would lead quickly to m ajor new problem s.   Mr. Chairm an, in m y view m onetary policy is not part of the econom y’s problem today. And going forward, I see m onetary policy as  having only a m arginal role in the solution.  At the first of this year a strong policy response was critical  and I’m  proud of the way this Comm ittee responded at that tim e.  But now I feel that if we visibly but m odestly support the natural forces of recovery and rem ain patient, we can be m ost effective. Let m e conclude where I began.  Obviously, on balance thing s are s till we ak.  But I continue to believe in the m antra of recovery initiated by tax and in terest rate cuts and  rebalanced invento ry position s, aided by lower e nergy costs and now, perhaps, a som ewhat lower  dolla r.  But we cannot ignore our serious investm ent coll apse, a very dangerous world situation, and the possibility of a tiring consum er.  What really co ncerns m e most of  all is that we m ust rem ain concerned at a tim e when we expected to be relaxi ng a bit.  It’s just possible that we m ay have problem s ahead of us that we do not yet see.  At any rate, we’re not out of the woods yet.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s turn now to Don Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As many of you remarked at the Committee’s June meeting and again today, the special characteristics of the current slowdown are shaping th e appropriate course of monetary policy and its likely effects. 8/21/01 60 In particular, the major driver in this slowdown seems to have been a re-evaluation of the profitability of new capital equipment--especially high-tech equipment.  In these circ umstances, lower interest rates are likely to cushion the resulting declin e in investment demand only very partially. Importantly, though, policy easing works through the household sector, with lower interest  rates bolstering asset prices and wealth and giving more direct incentives to spend by reducing the cost of acquiring houses and household du rable goods.  Policy action may also help to maintain consumer conf idence.  Judging from the prices of houses and from activity in housing markets, and from the well maintained pace of consumer durable purchases, in this regard to date your easing actions are indeed having much of their predicted and intended effects. And lower inte rest rates undoubtedly are keeping equity prices from falling much mo re as earnings disappoint.  By bolstering household spending, polic y is laying the foundation for a recovery in capital and inventor y investment, working indirectly through multiplier and accelerator mechanisms.   But some of the characteristics of the current episode do suggest that the 275 basis points of policy easing so far may not produce the same degree of strengthening in aggr egate demand, at least for a time, as a movement of similar size might ha ve in the past.  It is not that policy has been ineffective--that you are “pushing on a string.”  Rather, declines in interest rates have b een operating against some powerful and unusual forces of restraint. The re-evaluation of capital profitability seems to be produci ng a larger and more persistent large revisions to expected profits are reducing equity  prices despite lower interest rates. Moreover, b ecause high-tech production is spread widely around the world, so too has been the drop-off in demand, output, and equity wealth. With other economies also threatened, the dollar has not depreciated in response  to policy easing so that foreign economies have not absorbed any of the weakening in demand in the United States through the exchange rate channel.  Finally, because household spending was never substantially depressed, stocks of houses and consumer durables probably ha ve not dropped below desired levels. This implies that the rec overy in spending once the economy starts to firm may be less ebullien t than usual, since it will lack the extra push from the so-called pent -up demand from households often seen in the past. In these circumstances, the federal funds rate may need to be lower for longer than you might have antic ipated to produce a return to sustainable growth at around the economy’s potential. These unusual restraining forces are partly im pounded in our 8/21/01 61measures of the equilibri um real federal funds rate, which as a result have declined appreciably over the la st year.  Hence, a portion of the from tightening relative to this yard stick.  But our measures of r* in general do not reflect the full extent of these restraints on spending.  The equilibrium rate we have b een estimating is a medium-term concept--the real federal funds ra te at which the economy eventually will produce at its potential after temporary shocks have worn off. Thus, temporary shocks, such as at ypical asset price movements or weak investment relative to its longer-term trend, tend not to be embodied in some or all of the measures we use.  If those shocks are large or persistent, as they seem to be at this time, real rates will need to be held appreciably below the range of estimated equilibrium rates for a while to foster satisfactory economic performance.  Moreover, you may have reason to believe that the true ra nge for r* is lower than that given in the Bluebook. Most of those esti mates rely on the staff’s judgment about the NAIRU.  If unemployme nt rates appreciably below 5-1/4 percent are sufficient to contain inflation, the equilibrium rate will be lower and the gap between it and the current real funds rate correspondingly smaller. A policy that eases substantially and leaves the funds rate well below the estimated equilibrium is  not without potential risks and drawbacks that a number of you also noted  at the last meeting.  Some of you regretted the degree and frequency of variation in the federal funds rate adjustments. You were concerned, in part, that wide swings in the policy instrument would themselves create uncertainty and unsettle aggregate output and prices. And th e larger the shocks, the larger the necessary movements in your policy instrument.  To be sure, policy can be excessively activist, accentua ting business cycles by reacting to perceived shocks that in practice e bb quickly or by being insufficiently forward looking. But the most serious problems have occurred when policy has been too sluggish--desta bilizing the economy and financial because the central bank acted too l ittle.  This is a major lesson that your predecessors took from their experience in the 1970s and that many observers have drawn from the tepid response of the Bank of Japan in the early 1990s to th e bursting of the asset bubble. A potentially more troublesome con cern raised by having the real federal funds rate well below its equi librium level is whether policy can be tightened in a timely enough mann er to forestall the emergence of higher inflation. In the current circumstances, inflation pressures that might be difficult to head off could arise were demand to strengthen 8/21/01 62 very considerably before long or cost s begin to push up prices even in a relatively weak economy. Other thi ngs equal, the wider the federal funds rate gap, the greater this risk  would seem to be.  And balancing this possibility against the possibili ty that the weakness in the economy could be deeper or more prolonged th an anticipated or than needed to keep inflation in check would seem to be at the nub of your decision today. The staff forecast could be seen  as describing a rough balance between these two possibilities, at an unchanged stance of policy.  In that forecast, policy is accommoda tive enough to get growth in GDP back to the rate of increase in its potential by next year, with the help of fiscal stimulus, lower energy pri ces, and the inherent tendency of aggregate demand to expand at its lo nger-term growth rate.  As Dave Wilcox emphasized, though projected growth of actual output has been revised down appreciably in the forecast, so too has been the growth of potential, leaving the output gap and the inflation outlook not much different than in the June Greenbook. While the result is a small margin of excess capacity in the la bor markets in the second half of next year, with unit labor costs al ready having picked up, some slack the more rapid trend in compensation, the recent slowing of structural productivity growth, and the conseque nt narrowing of profit margins.  Core PCE inflation is held about consta nt in the staff forecast, at a rate a little above that of 1998 and 1999.  In your own forecasts last month for the semiannual monetary policy report, Committee members saw much stronger growth and lower unemp loyment rates than did the staff. Especially if that differential continues to prevail, the Committee may see further easing as incurring enough additional risk of building inflation pressures toward the end of  2002 to offset the added assurance it would give of a reasonable reboun d in growth earlier next year.  However, keeping rates unchanged may require more confidence in the forecast--your own or the sta ff’s--than the Committee has at this point. You eased at your last meeting, partly on the assessment that more weight should be put on the re ality of near-term weakness than on the projection of longer-term strengt h.  Continuing and persistent shortfalls in actual growth, even relative to downward-revised forecasts, may have reinforced that  assessment, arguing for another 25 basis points of easing at this meeting.  In effect, the anticipated pickup in the economy is starting from a lo wer base.  Moreover, a number of elements in the current situation c ould be seen as suggesting that the risks of further shortfalls in econom ic activity in the next few quarters are greater than the risks of higher in flation later next year.  Data and anecdotes on capital spending have ye t to indicate any abatement in the pace of weakening in this sector or  to allow a confident projection of 8/21/01 63just how far the decline in invest ment will go.  As Vince pointed out, revisions to growth in foreign economies, like those for the United States, have been one-sided. And consumption is threatened by the effects of softening job prospects on confidence and by the possibility of a further drop in equity prices if earnings expectations continue to be pared. Indeed, late last week, a nnouncements of disappointing earnings and sales caused a further appreciable  decline in equity prices and a widening of risk spread s in credit markets. In light of near-term weakness, the Committee may see any potential inflation pressures as suffici ently far into the future to allow it to detect early signs that growth was accelerating or prices picking up and take timely steps, even after fu rther easing.  This seems consistent with market assessments of your likely actions and their outcome.  structure of interest rates but also tightening next year.  That turnaround apparently is seen as occurring soon enough to keep inflation low, judging from the results of surveys of inflation expectations or from the relatively modest level of longer-ter m inflation expectations derived from Treasury securities, which in fact  have been declin ing of late.  In that regard, both market participan ts and economic forecasters appear to have marked down their outlooks fo r growth and inflation in the last month, largely in response to the unexpected weakness in demand and more moderate inflation.  The resu lting drop in interest rates and the exchange rate should help to cushion the effect of lower equity prices on economic activity.  Keeping the st ance of policy unchanged at this meeting would tend to lower equity  prices further and raise bond yields--a result the Committee might not  want to see unless it were of the view that market participants had reacted inappropriately to the developing economic situation. Given the tenor of the incoming information, with economic activity falling short of expectations  and projections of growth revised downward, the Bluebook writers assumed that you would judge the balance of risks as st ill tilted toward economic  weakness, even if you left policy unchanged at this meeting.  At some point in the future, when the Committee sees the risk of near-term weakness as balanced by the risk of higher inflation over the longer term, it would presumably want to shift its balance of risk statement and explain its reasoning in the announcement.  One path to that point would be a final easing that was perceived to put policy in a sufficiently accommodative posture to throw the risks into balance.  Alternatively, the Committee might retain its assessment of unbalanced risks for a little while even after it stopped easing because it was not yet confiden t that threats of added weakness had abated sufficiently.  This latter sequence would be consistent with your behavior in 2000 when you were concerned about inflation.  In 8/21/01 64 effect, by the summer of last year, yo u still saw the risks as pointing to higher inflation, but not by enough to  warrant changing the stance of policy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Questions for Don?   If not, le t me get starte d. I think it' s fairly eviden t, certainly in r etrospect, that we are se eing an absorption of very large capital losses throughout the econom ic system .  I don' t know whether one would call this a structural adjustm ent, but it certainly is not what we ha ve em bodied in our standard post-World W ar II econom etric m odels.  It's a differe nt sort of phenom enon and it’s clearly being engendered by a set of forces that  are largely without historical precedent in the post-World W ar II period. This does not m ean that we' re looking at  the type of severe business cycle contraction that the econ omy experienced on occasion in the pre-W orld War II period, but in m any respects the process of adjustm ent is sim ilar to that in the earlier contractions.  As a num ber of you have indicated, the current weakness is obviously concentrated in the capital goods m arkets and to a very substantial extent it stem s from  a downward adjustm ent of long-term  earnings expectations. I suspec t that the de clines in those ex pecta tions  are really quite m odest.  What I believe has happened, as I think I indicated at the last m eeting, is that the un certainties with respect to the change in the outlook have fostered a significant rise in risk prem iums in the capital goods expenditure has increased. Indeed, one can talk in  term s of a firm ’s refus al to invest its cash flow unless the return is realized in, say, 14 m onths or to change its PCs every year when the latter can obviously remain functional for three or  four years.  Nothing has happened in the last year to alter underly ing conditions ex cept a ch ange in judgm ents.  The PCs haven' t changed.  The technologies underlying the infrastructure  of expanding infor mation system s haven' t changed. And indeed all the evidence that we ha ve today suggests that our previous conclusions 8/21/01 65 about the ou tlook for cap ital inves tment are still ba sically tru e, nam ely that firm s have a long way to go in exploiting the total available capital investm ents that  offer sig nificant abo ve-hurdle rates of return. What has happened is sim ply a fundam ental shift in the general degree of confidence. In the sam e sense that ex pectations  were very clearly overdone on the upside, they are being un derdone, if I m ay put it that way, on th e downsid e; and th at will con tinue to be so until the norm al cycle, not of the bus iness env ironment but of hum an psychology, runs  its cou rse. One could argue with som e obvious evidence,  and indeed a num ber of you have so argued, th at econom ic conditions h ave deteriorat ed since our last m eeting, and I th ink that assessm ent is accurate.  But the econ omy clearly has not co llapsed.  The fundam ental evaluation of the behavior of the econom y is still basically the sam e, and as in the early spring the concerns about a false dawn rem ain.  Indeed, we ar e looking at aspects of that even today. As you m ay recall, I indicated at the June meeting that corporate earnings were going to be a particularly difficult techni cal issue in th e neare r term.  The proble m is rela ted to the f act that in June security analysts were estim ating a double-digit increase in third-quarter per share earnings, seasonally adjusted not at  an annual rate, and that estim ate was just not credible.  The only question was the mechanism  by which a downw ard adjustm ent would start to em erge.  Frankly, it em erged a little differently from  what I had expected.  I thoug ht that the s econd quarter was pretty m uch locked in.  After all,  by the end of the m onth, with the inf ormation technology system s that firm s now ha ve in place,  they knew pretty m uch what their earnings would be with one exception. It's called end-of -quarter adjustm ents for which there is very considerable discretion. Looking out into the third quarter an d seeing less than enjoyable prospects for earnings, firm s decided to m ove som e of the bad news into the second quarter.  As a result, they reported a very fairly dram atic d ecline in s econ d-quarter earnings stemm ing from 8/21/01 66 downward revisions at the very e nd of the quarter that were not credibly b ased on real events.  After all, it' s not as thou gh we are still in the old quill p en days where bu siness f irms were thr ee weeks behind in their bookkeeping. There has been, of course, a very dram atic downward revision in expected third-quarter earnings. But because secon d-quarter  earnings were revised dow n, we still have a significan t seasonally ad justed increase in expe cted earn ings per share as estim ated by  the analys ts for the th ird qua rter.  Thos e earnings forecasts still h ave som e distance to go on the downside. What is presum ed to be a lead i ndicator of near-term  earni ngs, the so-called profit warnings com ing out of the com panies, is showing fairly s ignificant ev idence tha t further s izable downward revisions are in the m ix.  I think one of the key reasons why, I believe quite appropriately, the Greenbook projects capital investm ent to continue soft in the second half is that, as his tory tells us, the chances that invest ment spending will tu rn aro und quickly are fairly remote until we get a tu rnaround in cash flow.  It's not an is sue of taking o ut the overh ang in capital investm ent.  I think business firm s are in  the process of doing that; they m ay even have done it to a very large extent by no w.  But we have to pro ject that cap ital spending w ill fall below sustainable levels, and indeed in a sens e build up som e backlog.  Markets never go from over-ex tension back to n ormal.  I can’t recall any case where that has happ ened, yet ou r forecas ts always tend to project th at it will h appen.  And when we get close to where we think it is about to happen we realize that it' s not turn ing ar ound b ecause the o ver-ad justm ent on the d ownside has not yet occurred. In a sens e this is not a busin ess cycle iss ue; it's a hum an cycle issue. The data, of course, are not as bad as th e psychology.  Indeed, looking at the profits data, a part of the problem in the national in come and product account nu mbers, which are a lot weaker than the data in the S&P 500, is the fact that those data are refl ective of what com panies 8/21/01 67 must repor t to the IRS.  This m eans that th e value of exercised options is reported as compensation of e mployees and a reduction in pr etax profits.  In standard FASB accounting, that's not the  way they do it; and by that accoun ting standard,  firm s have higher e arnings numbers.  The IRS numbers, by including the very  large dollar value of exercised options, have added a big chunk to the reported compensation of  employees and have taken out a big chunk of profitability in recent years.  Obviously, the value of options  is now a rapidly depreciating number.  In that sense we are going to see co mpensation per hour slow down significantly, and we will also see som e modest buoyancy starting to occur in the underly ing earnings figures, for no m atter w hat com panies say, they know that stock options are a gam e that' s being played.  And they know that they can' t hedge the stock opti on exercise effectively because the cost of a derivative to hedge against an opti on grant is usually a fairly heft y sum  of money.  So what they have been doing in effect is going short on the value of their stock options, and doing that has been very ex pensive f or a lot of  companies.  But implicitly it is going to h elp them  or has helped them  in this cycle.  In sum, I think the profit figures probably ar e unduly depressed at this point.  Moreover, with the energy costs coming down but the con tract co sts of energy still som ewhat higher than the spot prices, there is a delayed e ffect in the im pact of high energy costs on profits. Now, I'm not about to say that we will soon get a recovery in pr ofits.  I find that prospect exceptionally unlikely and the reason is that there is no pric ing p ower in m arkets ac ross the nation. I would suspect th at when this whole episode is o ver we will have a lower rate of inflation, even in the PC E consum ption deflator.  As I look at the pricing structure, I see very little evidence that discounting is com ing to an end, as other members have pointed out, and perhaps that is helpful in the sense that it has been a factor buoyi ng household consumption.  It is household consum ption or household de mand m ore generally that clearly is the 8/21/01 68 source of strength holding this economy together .  In this rega rd I th ink th e evidenc e is increasingly persuasive that the capital gain s realized on the s ale of hom es are ins erting a fairly significant amount of purchasing po wer into the econom y.  Indeed, such gains appear to have been enough to significantly offset the negative  effects of the decline in equity prices on consum ption expenditures.  The m ore I look at the data, the more I am  persuaded that the deflationary effect of lower equi ty prices is con centrated in th e capital goods m arkets.  And the lower im plicit rates of  return tha t thos e pric es cap ture ar e reflected som ewhat le ss than  I think we would have anticipated in the household sector. And, as best I can judg e, that is wholly a reflection of the fact th at the propensity to consum e out of realized capital gains on hom es appears to be significantly higher than it is on both unrealized capital ga ins on hom es and capital gains in general on equities. This strikes m e as a reason for viewing as im portant the support that housing is providing to the expansion. I suspect that without that support we would be observing m uch lower levels of econom ic activity.   The liquid ation of inventories con tinues apace.   The rate of liquida tion h as not slowe d appreciably. It does fluctuate from  month to month. The book value data are questionable, but alternate ways of estim ating inventory change esse ntially conf irm that the rate of liquidation is significant. However, inventory- sales ratios are holding up because  the rate of decline in the consum ption of industrial production is about in line with the rate  of decline in inventories. In sum , with foreign econom ies clearly w eakenin g significan tly, we are in  a situ ation as best I can judge where the economy is bei ng held up by household dem and, which fortunately is running som ewhat better than I think m any of us would have anticipated.  The press reaction to the July retail sales figures I thought was quite startling.  When  we take out sales of gasoline and m otor vehicles, those retail sales figures were  really strong, yet the press played them  as 8/21/01 69 tepid. With personal consum ption expenditures hi gher in July, third-quart er expenditures should rise even if they do not go anywhere in August and Septem ber.  So, insofar as I can judge, the key source of support for the econom y is com ing from  the spillover out of housing into household dem and.  Of course, streng th in new construction of hom es is helpful, but I believe the more powerful force on total GDP at this stage is  the turnover of existing hom es that engenders realized c apital ga ins. I believe we have som e distance to go before  we get out of this period of weakness.  I think our forecasts at this stag e essentially reflect hope.  We do not yet see any evidence of the beginnings of a turnaround. It's not that the eco nomy is falling apart; it is not.  But econom ic conditions are continuously erodi ng and we get that sense in an ecdotal reports from  around the country. A possible exception is Je rry Jordan ’s select sam ple!  Clearly, if  GDP is still growing at a 1 percen t rate, we inev itably will f ind that a large num ber of com panies are doing very well and that would not be the case were  we experiencing a m inus 5 percen t rate of declin e in activity.  The widespread anecdotal repo rts that I am  exposed to do not contain very m any straws suggestive of an upturn, but that is  the way the econom y looks at a cy clical bottom .  In fact, if we go back and look at p revious bottom s, we will find  people say ing exactly what I hav e just said.  Indeed, a necessary condition for a bottom  is the exhaustion of negative psychology that sets the stage for an upturn in optim ism. I believe we will even tually get the projec ted up turn.  I don' t think th at the Greenboo k forecast is wrong by any m eans.  For exam ple, the weekly chain store sales data look q uite impressive.  The data that we got  this m orning do suggest  that the tax rebate s are being spent.  And if they are being spent, a nd we know there are $36 billion of rebates, then they’ve got to have a positive im pact.  Even so, the recovery is  likely to be a long pro cess, and the presum ption 8/21/01 70 that the uptu rn will o ccur very quick ly is in m y view just a total m isreadin g of the underly ing adjustm ents to capital losses that are occurr ing.  They are by no m eans completed, and I don' t think we can  get a vib rant respons e out of this  econom y until these capital losses are reasonably fully absorb ed.  And because activity  in m any sectors of the econom y is already at relatively high levels, the extent of the recovery cannot be large.  Rem ember, the motor vehicle and housing sectors are still experienci ng well above norm al levels of ac tivity, certainly for this stage of the cycle. So I think the process of  adjustm ent still has a long way to go.   While the outlook rem ains subject to a good d eal of uncertainty, I do think as m any of you have suggested, that the approp riate policy at this stage is to  move the federal funds rate a notch lower. A 25 basis point re duction strikes me as appropriate.  If we were to go 50 basis points, our action would alar m every one to an ex tent that I do n’t th ink we can fully appreciate at this point. I thought the reaction to the la test Beige Book was very interesting.  Ordinarily, the going to m ove rates one way or th e other, and that' s it.  This tim e it was different.  The m arkets took this Beige Book as evidence that the Fed is a credib le institution.  Our sources were saying that the econ omy was softening and there was so me spillover from  the weakness in manufacturing to other s ectors.  We accepted what  they said, and the m arkets in turn believ ed what we have been saying. For the first tim e in quite a while,  that c redibility is b ased on what we have done. The credibility of our organization is crucial, and as I said were we to go to 50 basis points today I think we would alarm  everyone. I do think that the risks rem ain obviously we ighted toward econom ic weakness, but at some point we are going to have to stop our easi ng process.  As I said at the last m eeting, m y 8/21/01 71 suspicion is that we will be st opping when the m arkets in effect ar e telling  us to stop.  That will show up, for exam ple, when the Greenbook forecast of  a reco very actually begins to m aterialize --when we distinguish between a fo recast and reality.  What we need  is so me real evid ence tha t the capital goods m arkets are bottoming, that prof it erosion has stabilized, that we are seeing signs of  an upturn ins tead of still f urther nega tives whenever we evaluate what indiv idual companies are doing.  Instead of getting that, we w ould start to get reports that say the results this week are m ixed.  I haven' t seen a m ixed report in a very long tim e.  I’m referring incidentally to surveys that the staff m akes peri odically of about 6 to 10 com panies on a rotating sample basis .  The day th at such a rep ort com es in and indic ates that these r esults are m ixed will be the first sign I would take that  som ething is happening.  But I would say at this point that the real-tim e surveillance of the ec onom y, especially with what is clearly an acceleration in the deter ioration abroad, is o ne that  says we have not as yet com pleted our easing process.  So, I would put on the table a reduction of 25 basis poi nts with the risks weighted toward econom ic weakness. Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH .  I concur w ith your recommendation, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, for me the polic y choice is a close call.  While I can support the proposed easing, I do th ink there are som e reasonabl e argum ents for leaving the funds rate unchanged at this tim e.  First, th ere appears to be a consensus--supported by our outlook, the Greenbook, and even the lower 10 percent of the Blue Chip panel of forecasters- -that there already is enough stim ulus in the pipe line to produce a significan t pickup in activity in the next year or so. Second, although I certain ly hope you are correct in  your expectation that 8/21/01 72 the inflation figures m ay turn out a bit better than most forecas ts indicate, there is a chance that the current p eriod of slo w growth will end with little or no reduction in in flation.  So we m ight be m issing a chance for a little opportunistic p rogress on inflation.  Third, we will kno w quite a bit m ore by our October m eeting, especially about the effects of the tax re bate.  So an argum ent can be m ade that we should wait for more information.  While I’m  concerned about these considerations, I do support a 25 basis point cut in the funds ra te as som e insurance against additional downside surprises for econom ic activity.  I also would prefer to retain the balanc e of risks s tatement weighted toward econom ic weakness.

MR. MOSKOW .  Mr. Chairm an, I agree with both parts of your recommendation, for a 25 basis point cut and the balance of risks tow ard econom ic weakness.  You m entioned that if we did a 50 basis point cut, it w ould scare people.  I would add that if we did zero, I think it would have the sam e impact.  In my view this  is a tim e when consum er confidence and business confidence are extrem ely im portant to the econo my. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you. My interpretation of the course of policy is consistent with what Don Kohn said at the outset. That is, as best I can judge the situ ation, we’re trying to prop up com pone nts of aggregate dem and that are in terest-rate sen sitive until the invento ry correction process runs  it cou rse an d until conditions and at titudes chang e in a favorable way for capital spending. I don’t think that’s an unreasonable policy and it’s proba bly the best available policy.  As I’ve indicated before, I’m  concerned about the lags and w hat they m ean for our future course of action. But let m e add that I’m not opposed to a quarter  point reduction in the funds rate at this stage. I won’t get into the lag issue at any great length except to say that I 8/21/01 73 believe we are going to have to change course and adopt at least a policy of stability before there’s to tally persuas ive evidence th at the econo my is reacc elerating in a m ajor way.  I say that not becaus e I think we’re going to b e reluctant to change co urse when it’s approp riate but because of what I would call th e recognition lag.  It’s v ery un likely that the evid ence will accum ulate in such a way that it will be entirely  convincing th at it’s tim e to stop easin g policy.  My experien ce with th ese situ ation s in the pas t is that the evid ence com es in m ixed for  an extended period of tim e, so we’re going to have  to m ake the best judgm ent we can as that happens. In addition, if we think about the timing of the published data--the anecdotes, of course, m ay help--we won’t know if the econom y has rebounded until well after the fact.  Let’s suppose, just for illustrative purpos es, that the econom y really starts  to reaccelerate in the first quarter. Well, we won’t get all that much data  on the first quarter until w ell into the second quarter and the data are u nlikely to be convinc ing until well in to the th ird quarter.  So I’m concerned about that re cognition lag going forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I just want to say that I think our techniques of knowing where we are have im proved a great deal. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Well, I sincerely hope you’re  right but the proof is in the pudding. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Well said!  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I can support your recomm endation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I think your proposal is just right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairm an, I support both parts of your recomm endation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Minehan. 8/21/01 74

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman.  I have had concerns similar to President Stern’s and possibl y others around the table that we won’t quickly recognize when the economy has turned around and that policy will be too easy too long.  But given where we are, it seems to me that policy n eeds to be a little easier in order to provide the appropriate level of support. I was struck by your comment that virtually the whole world economy is supported by consumer spending and the residential housing markets in the United States. It’s a powerful thought and one that occurred to me as well.  So I am in favor of this move but I think we need to be very careful going forward for all the reasons that President Stern mentioned. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairm an, if you’ll fo rgive a personal not e, let m e make a couple of comments here. After our m eeting in June, where I supported a quarter point reduction in the funds rate, one of my FOMC c olleagues came up to m e and said “G ee, you’re really changing stripes. Where is the old inflation hawk I used to know? ” 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. That was actually m e! 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. And that’s a fair questi on.  But the answer I would give to the question is that I can rem ember when the Comm ittee did not have full cred ibility.  A lot of  us were saying then tha t if we could ev er ach ieve c redibility, tha t would give  us greater f lexibility to move the funds rate in the short run in c onjunction with changes in econom ic conditions.  And, of course, now I think we do have consider able credibility.  And with the downside risks still quite substantial, as you a nd others have m entioned, I think we need to take advantage of that c redibility.  To say the sam e thing a bit d ifferently :  Unlik e the s ituation in a num ber of earlier postwar episodes, we don’t need a recession to contain inflat ion or inflation expectations 8/21/01 75 at this poin t.  We may have a recessio n ultim ately or we m ay not.  But if we do, I th ink it’s important that the Fed not be perceived as contribu ting to it-- or worse, ac tually caus ing it.  So I’m not ready to disappoint m arket expectations today.  Therefor e, I agree with you and I favor going ahead with the expected quarter point reduc tion.  If we don’t, I think it would be a big surprise and quite disruptive. Having said that, there isn’t any doubt, though, that the real funds rate is not very far above zero. And if the econom y is near a bottom --and here is where I m ight disagree with you a bit because it seem s to me that there’s at leas t some mild evidence tha t it could be--I think we need to be p repared to reverse cou rse if necessary and to begin to tighten policy. But m ore to the poin t--and this is re ally the main point I would m ake--I th ink we need to prepare the m arkets and the general public fo r that possibility, which I don’t think we’ve done adequately to this point. There are lots of ways to do it.  One way would be to go ahead and drop the rate a quarter of a point at this meeting and g o to a symmetr ic directive.  However, I agree that that would be pushing it. Nevertheless, I do believe that our statem ent, which is now an increasingly im portant signal of  what we m ay be doing down th e road, should indicate clearly that there’s at least a po ssibili ty that the easing cycle m ay now be approaching an end.  Our objective ought to be to try to preem pt as m uch as we can the quick developm ent of market expectations of yet another rate cut at the next m eeting, so that we’ll have greater flexibility at that m eeting.  So I would hope that our statem ent this tim e might have som e language like that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Well, at this  stage the prelim inarily statement does two things, both of which it did the last tim e:  One, it m entions how m uch we have reduced the rate since the beginning of the y ear; and two, it e liminates an y notion of an interm eeting m ove.  But also remem ber that what we did m ost im portan tly last tim e was that we  cut the f unds rate by 8/21/01 76 25 basis points and not 50. And I think that set the pace.  Clearly, at th e poi nt we see the picture becom ing mixed--when the data cease to indicat e weakness almost across the board --that’s the first sign tha t the bo ttom is being h it.  We’re at  least a m eetin g away fr om that, m aybe two; we really don’t know yet. But I do think that we have to be clear that there is a bottom  to this.  I agree with that. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.   Mr. Chairm an, if I could comm ent.  I think by saying that we’ve reduced the f unds rate by a total of 300 basis points and by continuing to take out any notion of  an inte rmeeting m ove, the f inancial m arkets will in terpret the s tatem ent in exactly the way you want. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. I think that helps , Bill.  But g iven the level of the funds rate now, I think an ad dition al phrase m ight be prudent.  I’m not sure I’m  selling th is to anybod y here!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  Mr. Chairm an, I suppor t your recomm endation.  I agree with those who think that down the road--in a few qua rters or m aybe a year--having m oved the funds rate down today m ight com plicate our problem s.  But I think we have to do it.  I would also underline som ething Don said, nam ely that right now we’re in a position where both r and r* are dropping. So we’re really not getting as far out of balance as it might seem. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Santom ero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Given m y views of the econom ic outlook and the risks that we observe, I think both  parts of your recomm ended policy are correct.  So I support your proposal. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn.  8/21/01 77

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, I can suppor t your recommendation.  I think the arguments for another modest easing move have b een made around the table.  I would say that I --and I suspect others who have offered some argu ments on the other side at the June meeting--had revised those arguments coming in today’s meeting.  I wanted to make the same point, though, that Gary Stern, Cathy Mi nehan, and Al Broaddus made.  And that is that I’m not comfortable yet, even with your re sponse to Al, that we have quite figured out our exit strategy.   We need a way to convey that, not only internally but externally, before we have to do too much explaining. Al, you made a sale with me!  I don’t know whether th e answer is a phrase in the statement or what.  But if we continue to ease an d continue to have the balance of risks statement the way it has been, I’m not sure how we will get off that treadmill as quickly as I suspect we’re going to want to. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think the m arket is going to take us of f the tre admill. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. I hope that ’s the way it’s done. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  In fac t, if we c ould actually arrange it, that would be the ideal way. In other words, the ideal way would be that we d on’t shock the m arket but that suddenly we get the federal funds futures rates fl atten ing out b ecause the d ata are begin ning to look better. And at the mom ent I see nothing to prevent us fro m doing that.  Goverrnor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Mr. Chairm an, like som e othe rs, I do worry a bit about the adjustm ents that will becom e necessary as th e econom y begins to recover on the other side of our current problem .  But I support your recom mendati on.  I think it’s right for today. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. I support your recommendation, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Jordan. 8/21/01 78

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. First, I’ll m ake su re that before the next m eeting we do get not only som e mixed reports but also som e strong reports!  [Laughter ]  Some of my Bank’s directors have turned from  being very bearish tw o or three months ago to  saying, “Wait a m inute, things are starting to im prove.”  So I’ll m ake sure you hear som e of those reports, too.   I associate myself with som e of the co mments of Jack Guynn, Al Broaddus, and Gary Stern. I, too, worry about the con cerns they m entioned.  But I also believe the risk is high that an extern al event will m aterialize th at will require us  to respond.  We’re goin g to have to respond to it from  wher ever we are, and we m ay have to respond very aggressively. So I’d rather have some more dry powder to be used because there’s nothing that a little adju stment in our dom estic policy c an do to allevia te the s ituations extern al to the United  States th at we view as most threatening. And I don’t see that small adjustm ents in our policy stance are likely to be very helpful in turning around the psyc hology within the United States.  I think your analysis is right about cap ital spending ; it will s tart to  improve once the risk s tarts to narro w.  So how do we get from  where we are to th at process where th e risk  prem ium starts to narrow and we return to business as usual?   I don’t know, so I too worry about an exit strategy. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, I think th e proposal you put on the table is quite reasonable and I would support it. Let me make a couple of comments.  I do think our policy is accomm odative right no w and it will becom e more accomm odative with this m ove.  But in m y view it’s not just the m arkets that are nervous and uneasy.  Main  Street is also nervous and uneasy. Your proposed action serves to address th at to an im portant degree and, therefore, I am supportive of it. I do agree with those who are concerned about the lags and about our ability to reverse course at the appropriate time; that isn’t a science but in  part it involves our recognizing 8/21/01 79 when to do so. We have to trust that we’ll be able to do that at that tim e.  So I’m  very supportive of your recommendation at this point. One thing I have to say, with due deference to Al Broaddus, is that I do not want an expanded statem ent.  I argued hard f or the statem ent to be shorter and I think it should stay that way. In my view the m arket has to recognize ou r stance by our actions and by what is happening in the economy--that is the best way to get the me ssage a cross--and to re act to that inf ormation at the appropriate tim e.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Before we take a vote, sin ce the press s tatem ent is a relevant part of the decision here , I would ask the Secret ary to distribute copies of the draft.  Let me just say that what was done is as close to a de m inimis change from  the previous statem ent as we could com e up with.  Michelle, did you provide  the wording of the la st statem ent as well? 

[SECTION]

MS. SMITH. Yes, the proposed language  is shown, with strike-outs indicating changes fro m the previo us statem ent. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Okay, so we can actually see the changes from  the previous press release. We took Pres ident Hoenig’s advice, as you can see. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  He’s  a very im portant fellow. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. I’m flattered. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Excellent. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  Amen! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Okay, then we  can vote on the 25 basis point cut and the risks tow ard econom ic weakness.  Will you read the directive langu age, please? 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD. This language is on page 15 of the Bluebook.  It’s a little hard to 8/21/01 80 find but it com es after Chart 3, which has the blue -shaded section in it:  “The Federal Open prom ote sustainable growth in output.  To fu rther  its long -run objectives, the Comm ittee in th e immediate future seeks conditions in reserve m arkets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 3-1/ 2 percent.”  The balance of risk s statem ent for the press release reads: “Against th e back ground of its  long-run go als of price s tability and sustain able econom ic growth and of  the inf ormation curre ntly ava ilable, the Comm ittee belie ves tha t the risks con tinue to be weighted m ainly toward conditions that m ay generate econom ic weakness in the foreseeable future.”

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We will rece ss briefly so the F ederal Reser ve Board ca n meet on the discount rate.  The reaso n we’re goin g into recess, as you know, is that this press statem ent presupposes a discount rate action that ha s not been taken.  So until that’s assured we cannot adjourn. May I ask the Bo ard m embers to go into m y office?  Hopefully we’ll be back shortly to confirm  an ac tion on the discount rate. [Recess] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  The Board of Go vernors accepted disc ount rate requests 8/21/01 81 from seven banks.  This meeting then is adjo urned upon confirmation of the date of our next meeting, which is-- 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD. October 2nd. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  October 2nd. As you are aware, th at is an interesting day, which m ay or m ay not be devoid of conflicts  for other than m onetary policy reasons.  We are m onitoring the situation f airly closely and if we need to m ake any adjustm ents in the m eeting date or location we, of c ourse, will be in contact with all of you imm ediately. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, you said m eeting dates and location.  I presume the date would stay the same but the location might change if circumstances warrant.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, I would assume that.  I amend my remarks accordingly.  Shall we go to lunch?
