CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection, they are approved.  Dino. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I’ll be referring to the charts with the salm on cover that were distributed to you.1 I will break up m y remarks into two parts.  First, I will talk abou t general say a little about our operations in  the afterm ath of  the attacks. The f irst cha rt shows sho rt-term deposit r ates for the United States, the euro area, and Japan. U.S. short-term rates continued to had been declining even before Septem ber 11th, and the fall in those rates accelerated in the d ays followin g.  Cash rates declined after the Comm ittee’s Septem ber 17th reduction in the target fed funds rate, though the 9-m onth forward rate bare ly moved, a pparently reflecting the lingering expectation am ong som e market participants that rates will be rever sing cours e som e time next yea r. As shown in the m iddle panel, euro-area rates followed a similar pattern of heading downward gradually even before basis points several hours after th e FOMC’s policy announcem ent.  The Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank, and several other central bank s cut th eir rates as well. As you can see in the bottom  panel,  Japanese rates continued to scrape along near zero. Late on Septem ber 17th our tim e, early on the 18th in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan (B OJ) announced another so-called easing of policy when it stated that  its current account balances would be targeted at above  6 trillion yen as opposed to the 6 trillion target it had indicated previously. In the days  that followed, that balance grew and by the last days of the quarter it  rose to more than 12 trillion yen.  By today, it had eased a bit to 10.3 trillion yen, still significantly above the earlier 6 trillion target.  Interestingly, forward rates actually 1 Copies of the charts are reproduced in the Appendix. 10/2/01 2 ticked up a bit and the Japanese governm ent bond (JGB) yield curve was little changed after the announcem ent, suggesting to some that the BOJ’s tweaks in the past few months had ceased to have an impact on rates beyond the very short end of the coupon curve. The top panel on page 2 graphs th e 2-year, 10-year, and 30-year Treasury yields along with the target  fed funds rate since August 1st. Two-year rates declined, beneficiar ies of policy easing, a weak equity points from  about 165 basis points at  the tim e of the last m eeting.  The 10-year yield declined 32 basi s points, while the 30-year fell a more m odest 6 basis points.  Some market participants explained the restrained move in 30-year yields as reflecting n ascent inf lationary risks, while others attributed the p rice action to the canceled would lead to far higher Treasury su pplies than h ad been anticipated previously. The steepening trend observed in the U. S. Treasury yield curve has also been seen in yields abroa d, as reflected in the m iddle panel.  The 2- to 10-year Bund spread m oved alm ost in lockstep with move ments in our curve.  And even the Japanese 2- to 10-year spread steepened ever so slightly, prim arily due to a shift in the 10-year JGB yield. In the bottom panel we observe th at in som e segm ents of the bond m arkets the reaction has varied.  Spreads in the investm ent grade sector--not seen here--have la rgely been s table.  And in the cas e of agencies and swaps, the spreads have actu ally declin ed slig htly.  But spreads on riskier paper have widened.  The EMBI+ spread and the Merrill Lynch high-yield sp read both widened after the 11th. These high-yield spreads hit le vels last seen on January 2nd, the day before the F OMC’s first easing m ove in the cycle.  Trading turnover in em erging m arkets and on high-yield paper decreased after the attacks. And liquidity conditions  deteriorated and have not yet recovered to norm al levels.   The three graphs on the next page  depict the perc entage ch ange in var ious e quity ind ices for the th ird quarter.  The U.S. indices are shown in the top panel, m ajor forei gn indices in the m iddle panel, and a representative sam ple of e merging m arket equity indices in the bottom  panel.  Most indices dec lined between 15 and 30 percent and nearly all had fallen substantially even before Septem ber 11th, adjusting to downwardly revised grow th and profit forecasts.  Stocks of less estab lished com panies fared worse than more season ed companies.  In the United States the percen tage d eclin e in th e 10/2/01 3 

[SECTION]

NASDAQ was alm ost double the f all of the Dow and the S&P.  Internationally, em erging m arkets indices on balance fell som ewhat more than markets in m ore developed countries. Turning to page 4 and the m ajor currencies in foreign exchan ge trade-weighted indices, but showed considerab le varia tion in bila teral rates. In general, risk aversion wa s reflected in the appreciation of the Swiss franc and the yen, in part b ecause of perceptions about their value as safe havens, and probabl y more im portantly as yen- and Swiss franc-funded carry trades were unwound.  On the other hand, currencies of countries with large comm odity sectors, such as the Australian dollar, the Canadian dol lar, and the N ew Zealand dollar, deprec iated to near their all-tim e lows, as did th e curren cies of countries such as Brazil, which have large external financing requirem ents.  While the downgrade in U.S. growth has probably reduced exp ected risk -adjuste d returns on dollar assets, the contem poraneous downgrade of overseas prospects m ay have offset those adverse effects on the dollar. Turning to the m iddle panel, the yen had been appreciating against the dollar since ea rly August.  With the retrenchm ent of risk appetites, yen-funded carry tr ades were unwound and Japanese investors were reportedly repatria ting funds before their quarter-end.  With the sustained upward pressure on the yen, the Japanese monetary au thoritie s intervened on S eptem ber 17th and continued to intervene in large am ounts through th is past F riday, the end of the Japanese fiscal half-year. In all,  the Japanese m onetary autho rities purchased $ 26.7 billion and 600 m illion euros, w hich the EC B acquired as agent of behalf of the Bank of Japan.  The aggregate dollar purch ases included $200 m illion which th e Desk acqu ired as agent for the Japanese on Septem ber 27th. Within the f oreign exchange market, a m ajor topic of discussion among traders is whether the Ministry of Finance’ s intervention w as intended as a bridge to get Japanese financial in stitutions through the fiscal half-year-end on Septem ber 30th or wheth er the inte rvention will p ersist.  If the latter, that would be taken as a signal of a renewed attempt to jump-start the export sector. As the botto m panel sho ws, all of  the euro’s rec ent depre ciation occurred in early August. Since m id-August, the euro has traded in a narrow range. The currency is perceived as neither a safe haven nor an asset associated with an ec onom ic area that has higher grow th prospects th an the United States.  Therefore, ass et returns are expected to be no better and no wors e than what will be av ailable in the United S tates.   Turning to the next page, the terrorist attacks trig gered an increase in both observed and im plied volatility in m ost markets, and these graphs show the volatility of  a sample of major ass et price relationships. The top panel de picts implied volatility on one-month euro-dollar and dollar-y en options.  Both rose sharply on the 11th and hit highs of about 14-1/ 2 percent on Septem ber 17th, the day that the Comm ittee and other central banks eased policy, but declined in subsequent days. These volatility levels, though sharply higher than the volatility levels of 10 percent or  so in early July, are m odest by historical standards. In 1998 th e volatility of dol lar-yen options reached a high of nearly 28 percen t. The m iddle panel graphs  the im plied volatility of the Decem ber Eurodollar contract and the bottom  panel graphs the volatility of the S&P 100, also known as the VIX. Both volatility levels roughly doubled from their levels in late Aug ust and both  reached h ighs that exceeded slightly th e hig hs observed during th e 1998 crisis.  In the case of the Decem ber Eurodollar contract, the implied volatility exceeded th e 1998 high by quite a b it.  While the VIX index has that of the E urodollar contract both remained at elevated levels.   Turning to the next page, the top panel depicts total Federal Reserve balances day by day since the last FOMC m eeting.  With the disruptions caused by the attacks,  the com bination of discount window loans, open m arket operations, plus autonom ous factors sharply increased balances to as  high as $121 billion on September 13th. Despite the apparent flushness of markets, even allowing for higher dem and for excess reserves, this was deceiving.   The inset in the top panel shows balances, both borrowed and nonborrowed, for the entire banking sy stem  for the five days starting on Septem ber 11th. The green bar in the inset shows the end-of-day balances , which was having problem s with its clearing and settlem ent system .  On Septem ber 12th, the en tire banking system  held about $63 billion of reserves before borrowing.  before discount window borrowing and overdraft s.  Distribution of  reserves continued to  be a problem until the afternoon of the 14th when  began to m ake pr ogress in clearing its backlog of transa ctions.   By early th e following week, we began to work down balances as they started to be  distributed m ore efficiently. 10/2/01 410/2/01 5 The bottom  panel depicts the fed funds rate in the interm eeting period. The green line is the target  fed funds rate.  The red dots m ark the effective fed funds rate on each  day, and the v ertical lin e shows the high-low  range for each day.  With four of the five m ajor funds brokers incapacitated by the attacks,  banks largely traded directly with each o ther rather th an through brokers and they did so at the target of 3-1/2 percent in som ething of a “gentlem en’s agreem ent.”  This pattern persisted until late Thursday, September 13th, when the weight of reserves in the system first began to show through and the funds rate traded below its target .  This pattern of low rates, especially in  later trading , conti nued in the period after the FO MC’s interm eeting easing action on September 17th, particularly in light of the Comm ittee’s statem ent noting that the funds rate m ight occasion ally trade b elow its target.  By the 19th the Desk began to manage its operations with an eye toward restoring a sense of norm alcy in the m oney m arket, which had begun to take rates below 2 percent and even 1 percent for gran ted.  Thus we began to nudge the balance that objective ag ainst the de sire to respond to the financing needs of dealers, but by that tim e dealers were not experiencing m uch trouble getting their funding done  through their norm al sources. On page 7, the top panel shows three key autonomous factors that affected reserves during the period.  The grounding of air traffic created an immediate spike in floa t to about $47 billion on Septem ber 13th. The ECB’s three swap drawings added almost $20 billion at their peak. Those two factors added more than $60 billion of reserves on that day. Meanwhile, a near doubling of the repo pool drained reserv es.  On balance, th ese fact ors added reserves  during the first few days of the crisis and thus re duced what m ight have been even more traffic at the discount window on several days.  By the week of matured but the repo pool rem ained el evated, in part because of the large num ber of fails in the securities  markets, an d that was leaving central bank s with extra cash at the end of the day.  There was also an apparent desire for higher levels of liquidity, and in the case of Japan’s Ministry of Finance the need to invest large am ounts of intervention proceeds. The m iddle panel depicts the m ix of overnight and term repurchase agreem ents used to m anage reserves.  We had no operations on Septem ber 11th. At first we relied on overnight RPs to add liqu idity and allowed  severa l long -term  RPs to m ature with out replacem ent.  When m arkets started working better, we increased the level of long-term  RPs to help m eet underlying needs. 10/2/01 6 The bottom  panel shows for short-term RPs the level of accepted pro position s in red and th e level of rejected propos itions in blue. Normally, dealers subm it a large num ber of propositio ns of which we accept a relatively sm all amount.  For four business days, from  the 12th through the 17th, our operations were driven by the demand for financing rather than by reserve levels associated with a given funds rate. To better m eet these dem ands, we operated later in the day than norm al, after dealers had an opportunity to assess their financing needs. Then for a couple of days, on Septem ber 18th and 19th, we accepted virtually all deal er propositions on our overnight RPs. This was done not so m uch di rectly to m eet their dem ands but to provide the level of reserves  that was needed given that autonom ous factors, especially the repo pool, were draining reserves.  After we arranged several long-t erm RPs that se ttled on the 2 0th, the volum e of our short-term RPs dec lined and the volum e of accepted propositions was just a fracti on of total propositions.   Turning to the last page, I want  to give you a quick update on our securities lending operations dur ing the interm eeting period.  On a norm al day, the Desk lends out a handful of securities from  SOMA-- norm ally totaling less than $2 bil lion and frequently less than $500 million.  With the d isruptions caused  by the attacks, not only to the Bank of Ne w York but to several m ajor inter-dealer brokers and som e large d ealers them selves, the num ber of  fails rose dram atically .  With the flow of securities from usual sources disrupted or scaled back, demand for SOMA securities rose despite our rather high pricing structure. We lent out about $10 billion on Sep tember 11th, representing 70 different issues, and sm aller though still high am ounts in the days following. Volum es rose again last w eek in the run-up to the quarter-end and rem ained high yest erday.  Fails began to rise last week for the 2-, 5-, and 10-year on-the-run securities for reasons that are not fully  clear.  The dolla r volum e of our lending increased beyond $10 billion, although the numbe r of issues was less than on the 11th, again becaus e the num ber of fails was concentrated in the small num bers of on-the-run issues.   I want to m ake one final obs ervation.  On September 19th, the very sm all volum e of lending did not im ply tranquility on that day.  With the f unds rate tr ading sof t, the rate for general collatera l fell below 1 percent in the repo m arket.  Since the C ommittee’s authorization perm its us to lend secu rities at a m inimum of 1 percent, the form ula im plied a negative financing rate.  Hence it was cheaper for dealers to fail and pay the near ze ro fails rate than to borro w from the Desk, pay our higher price, and com plete settlem ent.  In reviewing the securities lending faci lity in com ing m onths, one aspect that we plan to study is the pricing structure.  In a low interest rate 10/2/01 7 environm ent, the general collatera l rate could be susceptible to occasion al declin es belo w 1 percent,  thus m aking it difficult for our securities lending program to meet its obje ctives. Mr. Chairm an, there were no foreign exchange operations during the period. I will need a vote to ratify the dom estic operations and I’d be happy to take any questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  First, let m e say that despite the tensions you were under, you m ake it sound very sim ple. And I applaud both what you did and making it simple.  When will you g et data on lending volume for October 1st? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Securitie s lending volume? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. We did a bit over $10 billion yesterday. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  In other words, the volum e was essentially unchanged from  Septe mber 28th? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. That’s right. Apparently the volum e of fails is still at a very high level. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But you still don’t know fully why that is occurring ? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. There are almost as m any explanatio ns as there are m arket participants. It is an issue that the market is struggling with, though.  But they’re still--

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. As a working hypothesis, assum e they’re all correct! [Laughter] Further questions for Dino? 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I’d like to m ove the ratif ication of the operations.  But I would also sugges t that the Committee add  to that a sense of gratitu de to thos e at the Desk for the way they handled such a very, very co mplicated and difficult situation.  And, of 10/2/01 8 course, the Desk itself was working in difficu lt circum stanc es with th e relocation of  its offices and all the upset that involved. So I think it was a fantastic perform ance and I believe the Comm ittee should refl ect that view in its vote to  ratify the Desk operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m sure your suggestion will m eet with no objection from  your FOMC colleagues.  Further questions?  Yes, President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I also thought that the Desk perform ed extraordinarily.  No m atter what kinds of contingency scenarios one m ight have envisioned, this was way beyond what anyone would have im agined.  So the Desk’s perform ance really was rem arkable. I was studying Charts 6, 7, and 8, especially  in light of the FOMC’s statem ent that the funds rate m ight trade below its ta rget for a while, which you m entioned, Dino.  It is clearly evident on C hart 6 that f or four  trading days you did let that happen.  But I can interpret the chart as saying that after a bout four days you pretty  much returned to operating in the way you norm ally do on a daily basis, letting the funds rate be both a floor and a ceiling. Part of m y question is:  Is that a fair characteri zation?  Also, I’d like to ask you to say a little more about the way you conduct daily operations in term s of factors supplying and absorbing reserves. What led you to the conc lusion that it would not continue to be appropriate to allow the funds rate to trade below its target?  The reason I rais e that is because in  periods of heightened anxiet y, liquidity preference, risk aversion, or other characterizati ons of these reactions we can’t  really observe, it would be very hard to know where an equilibrium  is.  The question really is:  How comfortable were you in starting to view the target funds rate as a floor in that environm ent? 10/2/01 9

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. In answering, let m e try to package those questio ns together.  I don’t think we viewed the target  funds rate as a f loor.  What we were trying to do was return to som e sense of norm alcy in the func tioning of  the m arket.  The lo w rate itse lf was creating problem s.  There were problem s for investors.  For exam ple, m oney m arket funds had trouble investing m oney; there were  complaints from i nvestors who could not get banks to take their m oney.  These and ot her problem s were being created by the very low funds rate and those issues had to be c onsidered.  What we also tried to do was to leave the m arket with enough liqui dity, but there was a sense that  if the rate rem ained too low for too long, som e of these unintended adverse affects would continue. If you look at the bottom of page 7, you can see that for several days beyond giving us. We were trying to respond to th e financing dem ands from  the dealers.  And even in the subsequent pe riod, once we got past the 19th and 20th or so, there were days when we tried to respond to the financing needs of the dealers even though it wasn’t necessary for reserve purposes. One of the wa ys we did that was by having the Treasury increase its balance. That way we coul d respond by providing the dealers with m ore financing than m ight have been dictated by the num bers.  So m y message is that we really did not view the funds target as a floor .  A lot of  the tr ading was below the targ et rate bu t there were days,  especially in the m ornings, when the rate was firm.  That often reflected efforts by European banks in particul ar to get their financing done early in the day. So we got a pattern with the rate firm  in early-day activity and lower in reduced trading at th e end of the day.   I don’t know if I answered your questions. 10/2/01 10

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Well, that was help ful.  The rea son I’m  raising the issu e is tha t intuitive ly I think one thing th at should not be allowed to happen is for the stock of centr al bank  liquid ity to declin e inad verten tly because of operational procedures.  So I was judgm entally struggling with the data in the Board’s H4.1 release for the week ending last Wednesday versus the week ending Septem ber 5th, the week bef ore the c risis.  I don’t know what the seasonal factors were  doing during that period--I can guess, though I don’t know for sure--but to see the m onetary ba se actually lower for the week ended last Wednesday than it was the week end ed Septem ber 5th alarm ed me a bit.  I questioned whether that is som ething I would want to  see happen.  If heightened anxiety am ong other factors caused the natural equilibriu m level to be very  low--though I don’t know where that level is--I don’t think we would wa nt to see our operating procedures result in the contraction of central bank liquidity. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. Actually, I think a la rge part of the reaso n central bank liquidity contracted com es through in Dino’s inset at the top of page 6, nam ely that interm ediation wasn’t functioning when four out  of the five federal funds brokers were out of service. As the fed funds m arket becam e operational and those with insufficient position s could get their reserv es from those wi th excess r eserves, th ere wasn’t a ne ed for us to blow u p our balan ce sheet to repl ace the un available interm ediation.  So I interpreted the reduction in nonborrowed reserv es and the decline in the Desk’s open functioning. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Yes, I think that’s an im portant  point.  A large part of that market was in effect bottled up. 10/2/01 11

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Yes, a nd I can underst and liquidity com ing down from  the elevated lev els imm ediately after the attack s.  But I was comparing the recent figures with those in the week before the attacks, the week ending S eptem ber 5th. That week a judgm ent on that.  But I was looking at this in  term s of wa nting to be com fortable with our position going forward. We don’ t know wh at’s going to happen or what the next terrorist event is going to be, but we can e xpect heighten ed anxieties, a p reference fo r liquidity, and risk aversion. Those are all ps ychological factors that we really can’t quantify. And we wouldn’t want those things to cause us inadvert ently to produce less centr al bank  liquid ity tha n we think is a ppropr iate.  Intuitively I think the dem and for central bank liquidity has had to go up, so I am  concerned to see th is contraction in supply. 

[SECTION]

MR. HILTON. The other issue we w ere facing early in the week after th e 17th was that, as a sym ptom that the finan cing m arkets were operating m uch more efficiently, the liquidity we had provided previously was beginning to have a very telling effect on financing rates and the funds rate. So when  we were com ing into the m arket in the morning, on som e of those operation s we were receiving p roposition s of below 1 percent.  We continued to accep t them  for a while, bu t there was no sen se of balance in the financing markets by the 18th or 19th--no sense that there was any upside risk to rates. And given the liquidity we had put in previous ly, market par ticipan ts wer e really testing how low rates could go. There is no natural fl oor above zero.  We did consciously reduce the am ount we were supplying at the m argin so that at least at the end of the day m arket participants would see that there was som e risk of rate s going up.  We saw a little 10/2/01 12 evidence of  that risk late r in th e wee k when in  late trading rates reached as high as 6 or 7 percent. Since we restored that balance to market expectations, though, we have been supplying som ewhat higher levels of  central bank balances. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. I’d like to add just one other point.  In establishing a reference po int, Pres ident Jordan, you m ight want to go b ack one or two weeks from a weekly standpoint your base poi nt is a little low relative to the previous two or three weeks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  If I could m ake a comm ent, Mr. Chairm an?   President Jordan’s concern, as I understand it, is that there not be som e sort of central bank orthodoxy that says that the funds rate target has to be put back in place at a tim e when it would be inappropriate.  Dino in both his presentation and in his answer to one of the questions indicated that he was being guided by the desire for a return to norm alcy.  That was our m antra at the Fede ral Reserve Bank of New York.  We were dealing with  a financia l community in which there was an advanced degree of traum a on the part of people at trading desks and t hose m anaging firm s.  And there was a very strong conviction in the community that the Federal Reserve System  and the New York Reserve Bank as its agent were going to do whatever was necessary to m ake the system function. Part of getting through a battle fatigue p eriod is that it is n ecessary to return life to norm al.  So the Desk was under instructi ons that when it coul d conduct operations in the way it n ormally does, it shou ld do so, becaus e that g ives a signal to the financial 10/2/01 13 community that life is okay again. And traum atized people need that signal.  In my view it’s a very important m essage that th e Fed m ust continue to d eliver becau se the traum a period is not over. Some of the firm s are st ill operating out of tem porary facilities and will do so f or months.  Some have suf fered enormous hum an losses.  In the cas e of Cantor Fitzgerald, two-thirds of the people in the firm  lost their lives on S eptem ber 11th. So this is no t a situation where every body w ill so on start to feel tranquil and okay; that won’t happen for quite a long period of tim e.  The m ore the Federal Reserve can say things are all right, we’re functioning as we  traditionally do, the better.  That’s a very important message to give.       

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Just to switch the s ubject a bit, Dino, you passed over the changes in the yield curve rath er quickly.  I’m interested in your perception of what the end of the curve is a supply issue totally  or if it is conveying other information. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. That’s a good question and one that doesn’t have an easy answer.  In my own view, the shift is not  so much an indication that people view inflationary risks as imm inent or that they have very strong e xpectations of future inflation.  I think it reflects m ore a concern about the fiscal side , given the talk of stim ulus com ing out of Congress, the cancellatio n of the Treasury’s buyback progr am, and the prospect for lower federal revenues. In the New York Tim es or one of the m ajor papers yesterday there was an article saying that perhaps we’ll have a fisc al deficit.  So the fiscal outlook has really changed. Now, the short end of the curve will  tend to f ollow policy, o r at leas t it has so far. But the long end is where the Treasury has been especially active with the buyback  10/2/01 14 program  and that’s where we m ight see concer ns or a shift in e xpectations about the fiscal side. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But if it’s wholly a m atter of supply, can’t you norm alize that judgm ent against corporate issues?  The yiel d spreads went up and it’s very tough to m ake a judgm ent, when we see movem ents like that, as to whether it’s a relative supply of Treasury securities vis-à- vis other securities or an aggregate supp ly effect. There’s no way, I gather, that we can  separate it out.  I took a look at the T IPS data and they don’t help either. The questi on sort of sits out there as a relatively important one because if we’re look ing at a supp ly phenom enon, the shif t we’ve seen  in the yield curve is what one would expect.  There has to be som e supply phenom enon involved. But whether, as President Minehan implies, an inflation prem ium is building up in the m arket is in m y view an important issue for us to get a sense of. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Any thoughts on how to do that? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I’ll work on it! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Any furthe r questions?  I believe Presiden t Poole m oved to ratify the trans action s.  Is there a second ? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  Second. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Without obj ection, they are approved.  Thank you very m uch.  Let’s m ove on.  We now go to the m ost important part of the m eeting-­the m ost inform ative, illum inating, and provocative, right? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Well, that fits in pe rfectly with m y introductory rem arks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I was n’t calling on you; I was calling on somebody else!  [Laughter] 10/2/01 15

[SECTION]

MR. STOC KTON.  If I were to scale the length of m y remarks this m orning to be in proportion to my knowledge about the current state of the econom y, the n I think it w ould be fair to say that I have already spoken too long. The terrib le events of Septem ber 11 have altered the political and econom ic landscape along so m any dim ensions that interpreting th e data and putting together th is forecast p resented us with unusually daunting challenges. In particular, we were required to take strong stands on questions  of psychology and politics-­consideratio ns that are always pres ent in cons tructing th e forecast, bu t rarely with the prom inence tha t they have achiev ed in the current circum stances.  For that reason, I th ought I could be helpful by laying out as clearly as possible how we handled som e of these issues in addition to d escrib ing ho w we have reacted to the broader macroeconom ic forces operating on the econom y. Our efforts were organized around four principal questions:  How was inform ation about econom ic developm ents prior to Septem ber 11 changing ou r view about the baseline forecast?   How large were the econom ic disruptions directly associat ed with the attacks?  To what extent and for how long would consum er and bus iness confidence be damaged in the afterm ath of these events?  And, importantly, how were changes in the stock m arket, interest rates, and fiscal policy shaping the outlook for output and prices over the next two years? With regard to the first questi on, the sharp drop in aggregate hours worked in August and the ongoing st eep declines in m anufact uring output suggested to us that real GDP  was, at best, eking out a m eager gain in the third quar ter prior to th e attacks.  Moreover, the com position of activity was rem arkably sim ilar to  that which we have observed since the spring: moderate advances in consum ption and government spending offset by continued declines in equi pment outlays and a further runoff of inventories. Based on developm ents prior to Septem ber 11, I suspect that we would have been com ing back  to the Co mmittee th is time with a forecast of essentially no  change in real GDP, on net, in the second half of the year and a slow acceler ation of activity next year. That assessm ent for ms the backdrop against which we had to evaluate the econom ic consequences of the terrorist attacks.  In collecting inform ation about the disruption of production and sales that occurred immediately following the attacks, we relied heavily on our business contacts as well as the extraord inary efforts m ade by research departm ents at the Reserve Banks to gather inte lligence on ac tivity in their Districts. Taken together, th e evidence sug gested that while the disruptions were pervasive and profound for business in New York, elsewhere th e larg est problems were concentrated  in a few m ajor sectors.  Air travel w as virtually shut down for several days, and m any sporting 10/2/01 16 and entertainm ent events were cancelled or postponed.  Auto production was disrupted by parts supply problem s associate d with the in terrup tion of air cargo flights and by a bac kup of trucks on the Canadian and Mexican borders. Retailing also appears to have been seriously disrupted, though it is important to bear in m ind that m uch of any shortfall in sales likely resulted in a buildup of retail inventories rather than an immediate curtailm ent of production. Some of these effects lik ely were alleviated later in Septem ber, and others could well be reversed in  the next couple of m onths.  Our very rough stab at the magnitude of these effects suggests that direct disruptions are likely to  have reduced growth in third-quarter GDP by about 1/2 percentage point at an annu al rate, with those effects largely expected to be reversed this quarter. As we enter the fourth quarter,  the bigger question surrounds the extent to which recent events will weigh on consum er and bus iness confidence. Readings o n auto sa les provided by the vehicle m akers, news reports, and common sense suggest to us that consum ers are likely to pull back on spending. With lit tle to go on, we have assum ed that consum er sentim ent will drop consid erably b elow levels im plied by current m acroeconom ic circum stances-- not quite so large over the next year as o ccurred in the afterm ath of  the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but still a significant drop by historical standards.  Last Friday’s report on consum er confidence from the Michigan  survey p oints to a de cline in sentim ent in the final week of the m onth that is roughly consistent with our expected pattern. We also exam ined how l arge shocks to sentim ent play out over time and how they are correlated with other com ponents of spending, and we adju sted our forecast accord ingly.  Going forward, we have the effects of this shock reducing the growth of real GDP by about 1-1/4 percentage points at an annual rate in  the fourth quarter and by about   3/4 percentage point, on average, in 2002.  Because there simply has been no other episode that closely matches the present one, it is very difficult for us to gauge the reason ableness of our assum ption.  Given that uncertainty, we considered a de eper shock to sentim ent--one that roughly equals in size that which occu rred after the invasion of Kuwait.  A shock of that m agnitude produces som ething resem bling a more typical reces sion.  But to  be perf ectly  frank, there is no com pelling reason to think that the shock coul dn’t be twice th e size of th e one associated w ith the invasion of Kuwa it, or f or that m atter, som ething considerably sm aller than we have assum ed.  Moreover, we can’t predic t how politica l, military, or terrorist actions could unf old in coming m onths or their potential influence on confidence and econom ic behavior. Obviously, we had to m ake som e big assum ptions on skim py 10/2/01 17 evidence, an d those assu mptions hav e had im portant im plications for the forecas t. Not all of  the developm ents tha t have occurred since the last meeting are immune to more conven tional econom ic analysis.  With all of the understandable focus on the recent tragic events, one could be forgiven for overlooking som e signifi cant sh ifts that have occurred in monetary an d fiscal policy.  In our fo recast, the federal funds rate is 125 basis points lower over the next year  than was incorporated in our dimension could be expected to ge nerate conside rable im petus to aggregate dem and down the road.  But, of course, this change cannot be taken by itself. The sharp drop in th e stock m arket and the widening of risk spreads in the bond m arket to da te have substantially blunted the stimulus from lower short-term  rates.  Indeed, as you know fr om reading the Bluebook, som e estim ates of the equ ilibrium  funds rate have fallen alm ost as m uch as the act ual funds rate.  We still view the funds rate as  having fallen below its equilib rium , and thus see the current setting of policy as capable of restoring a period of above-trend growth over tim e.  But the near-term  shock im plies that the adjustm ent will take lon ger and star t with a gre ater shor tfall of activity f rom potential than we had previously projected. I should hasten to add that it is im portant not to view these changes in financial developm ents in  isolation.  No doubt, som e of the firmness in long-term  rates in recent weeks reflects an expectation of a substantially m ore expansionary fi scal policy, which is poised to add more im petus to ac tivity over the n ext year than we projected in policy initiatives for fiscal 2002 and $76 billion o f initiatives in fiscal 2003, relative to a current services ba seline.  The figure for fiscal 2002 is roughly $ 30 billion more than in our August forecas t.  In ad dition to the em ergency supplem ental and airl ine assistance packages already passed by Congress, we have assum ed nearly $20 billion m ore in spending on education and FEMA, an extension of une mploym ent insurance benefits that costs about $10 billion, and a fiscal stim ulus package that ram ps up to about $22 billion by fiscal 2003.  To put the size of  the total pa ckage  in a cyc lical context, the  fiscal s timulus delivered over the next eight quarter s is only exceeded, and just a bit, by the com bination of tax cuts and increases in defense spending that occurred early in the Reagan adm inistration. Still, on our assum ptions, the uni fied budget surplus is $70 billion in fiscal 2002 and nearly $40 billion in fiscal 2003.  With m oney left on the tab le and  an em erging bipartisan consensus for greater stimulus, we believe that the balance of risks to  our fiscal assum ptions is on the 10/2/01 18 upside. For that reason, we incl uded in the Greenbook a sim ulation having enough additional stim ulus to  virtu ally elim inate the unified surplus over the next two years. Such actions would likely produce a faster turnaround in the growth of activity and trim the rise in the unem ployment rate; an adverse r eaction of the bond m arket would damp, but not elim inate, those effects. While we view fiscal policy as an  upside risk to our forecast, there also are som e very prom inent downside risks that are lik ely to be especially acute in the next couple of quarters.  An event such as occurred on Septem ber 11 could act as  a clear focal poin t that causes already skittish consum ers and busin esses to pull back sim ultaneously on spending plans. Those actions and their feedback on the econom y would raise significantly the proba bility of a sharp reduction in aggregate activity. I would also no te that even if we do not see immediate signs that such a contrac tion is under way, that ris k will not have receded com pletely.  Iraq inva ded Kuwait in early August, but the steep cu tbacks in aggreg ate outpu t did not rea lly commence until If I had to n et the v arious risks to  real activity in this forecas t, I would focus m ore on the downside risk s in the n ear term and the upside risks farther out. The near-term forces of contraction could be substantial, but so too could be  the m edium -term stim ulus from monetary and fiscal policy. Let m e conclude with a f ew words about inflation.  In an environm ent of increasing slack in  labor and product m arkets and consum er price inflation to decline ov er the next two years.  It might appear su rprising th at the disinf lation in this f orecast is as m odest as it is, given the degree of slack expected  to em erge in com ing m onths.  But in our view, there are a f ew reasons for being cautious in m arking down the outlook for prices. We have built in a sharp deceleration  in wages; our forecast of the increase in ECI wages drops f rom about 4 percen t this year to 2-3/4 percent in 2003. However, because there are few signs of any slowing of health in surance costs, th e deceleratio n in overall benefit costs is likely to be no ticeably less than that of wages.  Although benefit costs may well be offs et by reduced wage gains in the long run, the frequency with which business people com plain about health insurance costs suggests that this shifting is not likely to be immediate or painless. The effects of the slowing in compensation costs also show through to a lesser extent on prices because of the slower pace of structural productivity growth that  we are expecting over the next  10/2/01 19 couple of years. Moreover, with business m argins having been eroded in recent years, there is less scope fo r firm s to absorb cost p ressures in disinflation over the next two year s than m ight be inferred from  our forecast of resource u tilization alone. Karen Johns on will now continue ou r presentatio n.

MS. JOHNS ON.  In trying to com e to grips with the im plications of recent ev ents for the f orecas t, we  were confid ent that we knew in which direction to revise foreign growth as a result of information learned since the August Greenbook: down. But it was m uch less clear to us how to assess the m agnitude of that revision for individual foreign countries and for foreign growth on average. Our downward revision to the forecast for foreign growth has three com ponents:  (1) incorpora tion of the news about econom ic activity in the second qu arter and som e indicator s for July and August that hav e becom e available sin ce the August forecast was co mpleted; (2) assessment of  the implica tions for foreign econom ies of the new outlook for the United States; and (3) consideration of the extent to which the events of Septem ber 11, through asset prices, confidence factors, and key global prices and in dustries, will influence real output growth abro ad in additio n to the d irect im pact tr ansmitted by U.S. demand for imports from the rest of  the world.  The difficulties we confronted stemm ed from our lack of infor mation about real econom ic activ ity in th e days sinc e Septem ber 11 and the in herent uncertainty of prospective effects in th e rest of the world as foreign consum ers and business firm s react to events th at, at leas t so far, have occurred within the United S tates. As we reported in the Greenbook, the econom ic data that had becom e available in recent weeks suggested a m ore depressed global econom y than we had expected.  This was particularly the case for the emerging Asian econom ies.  There, the news was m ost negative for those whose exports of high-tech pr oducts were linked to investm ent spending in the United S tates and in other industrial countries.  However, there were disappointing data for other countries, including such industrial countries as Canada and Japan.  Incor poration of this inform ation accounts for a significant  share of our downward revision to foreign growth. As has been evident in th e global slowdown to date, a substantially weaker outlook for U.S.  real GDP has clear im plications, in the sam e direction, for real outpu t growth abroad.  Those effects are larges t for our princ ipal trad ing par tners, such as Canada and Mexico.  10/2/01 20 However, for other regions of th e glo be, such as Europe, the consequences of second and third ro und effects through m ultilateral trading relationships are far from  negligible.  Should we be further surprised by developm ents in the U.S. econom y, either positively or negatively, there would be a sign ificant re inforcement of  that surprise as output in foreign econom ies resp onded to the changed dem and from the United S tates. My third category of factors incl udes the host of reactions within the foreign countries and in global ma rkets to the events of Septem ber 11. We have seen net declines in stock m arkets abroad as large as 18 percent. Our research and that of  others suggest that the effect on consum ption of such changes in wealth  will not be as large abroad as in the United S tates, but the reaction will  be significant.  Similarly, we expect that c onfidence of  consum ers and business es will b e impaired by varying degrees across the rest of th e world.  We have a few bits of partial inform ation from survey s that included responses after Japanese Tankan survey, released on Monday, fell m ore than expected to its lowest level since June 1999 fo r the overall index.  At this point, we can only guess how widespread th e reaction of confidence abroad will be, how  long it will persis t, and how m uch it will con tribute to lessening dom estic dem and in foreign countries.    We also hav e incorpo rated into this f orecas t available inform ation from  global m arkets.  With respect to  oil prices, the spot price of W TI has m oved down, on balance, m ore than 15 percent since Septem ber 10, and f utures prices call f or it to m ove down slightly further.  Market participan ts seem  to be antic ipating that reduced global dem and for oil will be m et by only lim ited supply cuts by OPEC.  The recent international m eeting of  oil producers ended with  no agreed reductions in production quotas despite the fact that spot prices were below the target range for OPEC’s basket. The global m arket for high-tech  products in general, and semiconductors in particular, is an important elem ent behind our projections f or the em erging Asian ec onom ies.  Weakness in this sector underlies the significantly greater-than-expected dec lines in output that were recorded in the second quart er in Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. We have little hard information about inventories or production beyond August. Our projec tion that output in the region will recover next year depends upon som e improvem ent in this sector. We asked ourselves in which fore ign countries scope m ight exist for addition al policy res ponse to the further downward press ure on demand.  Among the industrial countries, m onetary policy has been 10/2/01 21 broadly eased during the fi rst half of this year, and eight m ajor foreign central banks cut rates further fo llowing your action on September 17.  Our forecast assum es that additiona l easing m oves will be tak en in Europe and Canada by year-end. Some emerging m arket central banks had been easing as well, as the global econom y slowed and dem and weakened within their econom ies.  However, we expect that external financing pressures will likely inte nsify, in particular for Latin American countries with external deficits, m aking it less likely that monetary ea sing will be enacted ther e.  Within Europe and in Canada, fiscal policy should be som ewhat supportive of growth in 2002 as tax reve nues fall and deficits widen; we do not expect significant discretiona ry easing m easures.  In Japan, however, the long-standing problem s within that econom y and the agenda of the Koizum i governm ent to im plement fiscal reform are expected to result in m oderate fiscal  contraction during next year.  Most emerging market econom ies have lit tle scope to increas e exp enditu res or cut taxes. One im portant ex ception is China, where continued governm ent spending is expected to  support growth during the second half of this year and next year. Other East Asian de veloping countries announced som e fiscal stim ulus m easures earlier this year. The downside risks to this forecas t are dis tressingly clear.  The hit to conf idenc e from the te rrorist attacks, com ing at a tim e when output abroad was already decelerating, could set off a mutually reinforcing cycle of production and em ployment cuts, downward earnings revis ions, lo wer asset p rices, and add itional drop s in conf idence.  Our expectation of a rebound next year is  based prim arily on the projected turnaround in the United States, reco gnition that monetary stimulus has been im plem ented in the m ajor countries, and our judgm ent that inventory adjustm ents abroad should be nearing com pletion by then.  There is no evidence as yet on which to base resolution of the tim ing and pace of recovery. That said, w e may be too close to  the events of Septem ber 11 to judge how countries m ore distant fro m those events will resp ond.  We were aggressive in ou r reaction to th e econom ic data and wo rld news since the August Greenbook. It is possi ble that the effect s of the attacks on growth abroad will be even m ore muted in co mparison to that in the United States than we have projecte d.  The possibility of such an outcom e constitu tes up side risk to o ur forecas t.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Moskow. 10/2/01 22

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  I want ed to ask yo u, David, about the psychology question, to use your term .  One of the keys to the forecast o bviously is consum er sentim ent and consum er spending.  I realize it’s very hard  to judge, but I would have thought that consum er sentim ent now would be as ba d if not worse than in the 1990-91 period following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwa it.  Then we had a fear of terrorism  on our soil; now obviously it’s a reality. Of cour se, you’ve dealt with a collapse in consum er and bus iness sentim ent in one of the a lternative Greenbook scenarios, but I wondered why you didn’t use that as the baseline. Do you have a ny other comments on how to compare these two periods in term s of consum er sentim ent? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I hope I m ade clear th at I didn’t think the probabilities of our assum ptions were significantly higher than the probabilities of a lot of others that could be m ade.  Obviously, we thought l ong and hard about exactly how much of a sentim ent ef fect to build in.  I think the reason w e ended up going with som ething less than what occurred after the Iraqi inv asion of  Kuwait was that that shock was also accom panied by a very distin ct econ omic shock through m uch, much higher oil prices.  And if one thinks back to that tim e, there were certainly enormous  fears about how long and deep a m ilitary co mmitm ent we m ight be making in the Middle Ea st.  It’s ea sy in retro spect to  look back and recall th at the m ilitary action wen t very well and was over so quickly. It’s a little hard to  put oneself back in the perspective at the tim e, when the initial thinking was that a lot of ground troops m ight be need ed and that it m ight involve a very blood y and protr acted m ilitary effort before the United  States could  disengage.  So we decided not to put in as much sentim ent effect at th is poin t and to react to the evidence as it f lows in, m aking adjustm ents up or down to what we have built into the 10/2/01 23 forecast. Obviously an other ch aracteristic th at is different b etween th is event and th e Iraqi invasion episode is that there w as a very distinct end to the latter.  And we had a very sharp recovery in s entiment once it b ecam e quite clear in February that the m ilitary engagem ent was going to be a relatively short and victorious effort.  We have the shock fading out more slowly this tim e.  Even though it’s not as deep, it fades out m ore slowly than what occurred after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  The pattern we have in our forecast is more typ ical o f large negative shoc ks to sentim ent.  These shocks rarely have, as the Kuwait period did, such a clear ending and such a sharp recovery.  So, as I said yesterd ay at the Board meeting, the forecast involves a very thin veneer o f science applied to a whole lot of judgm ent.  All I can say is that you as policym akers and we as forecasters are jus t going  to have to roll w ith the infor mation as it com es in and m ake appropriate adjustm ents from  there.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Karen, I want to ask you to  say a little m ore about Japan.  You mentioned that af ter the Co mmittee’s action on Septem ber 17th eight central banks eased policy. Well, that list w ouldn’t include Japan because in th eir case th ere was nothin g to announce in term s of a rate cut.  For at least some six m onths now they have been talking about quantitative easing and whether they ha ve m ade that real or not certainly is questionable. Then you m entioned that fiscal policy in Japan could be  contractionary.  I might conclude that a contrac tionary Japanese fiscal policy would be stimulative because they’ve had 10 years of pushing on the fiscal st rings with no effect, unless one thinks the econom y would have been worse without that.  One can look at the results of what has 10/2/01 24 been done o ver the last decade on th e fiscal si de and say that the Japan ese people are all Ricardian. The m ore the governm ent borrows and spends, the m ore its people don’t spend; they save, and the governm ent’s effo rt com es to nothing.  But as Dino m entioned, last week the governm ent did m ore than double the am ount of current account balances from  6 trillion to 12 trillion yen.  So I woul d think the im portant question for Japan is:  Are they going to unwind it or are they going to continue on what seem s to be quantitatively a very stimu lative monetary policy? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Well, to be honest I did include them  in the eight because they cut what they call the overnight discount  rate, which is a kind of Lombard rate.  Technically it’s an official lend ing rate of the Bank of Japan a nd they r educed it, so I said okay, they are one of m y eight.  And I think they intended, both from  the tim ing of the announcem ent and the w ay they expressed it, to indicate that they were going to do what they could along with their brot her central banks to weather th e storm  of this particular financial crisis. They wanted to be supportive,  in the sense of  aiding short-term  liquidity and m arket functioning and so forth in th e imm ediate afterm ath of the attacks. I think this period is somewhat of a crossroad s for them .  I interpre t the intervention that they did  and th eir de cision to le t the res erves stay in the s ystem  as an opening. Perhaps they are thinking of deliber ately using transactions in the exchange domestic money m arkets as a way of getting m ore liquidity out there.  The com bination of circum stances created  an appropriate m eeting of the m inds between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan with regard to undertaking these transactions.  They responded in the way we’ve all urged them  to re spond.  I took that to be a fairly positive  10/2/01 25 sign. It rem ains to b e seen what they  will do goin g forward, because at least today, for exam ple, the yen has softened and has not m oved up from  its low.  It’s possible that a lot of the pressure on the yen has had to do w ith the end of their fiscal half-year on open questio n as to whether the Bank  of Japan will r evert to its previous p ractice and s ay, “Well, that approach was fine then but it ’s not appropriate righ t now.”  I am very pessim istic that th is is a trul y long-lasting change in their ap proach, but I think what they did in the weeks since Septem ber 11th was in the right directi on and they could surprise us. They could be m ore aggressive than they’ve given signs of so far. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I had a question about Japan as well.  When I look at the tables in Part I of the Greenbook it seem s stunning--I don’t know if that ’s the right word--to see with the add ition of the f orecas t for 2 003 what  will be five years of deflation for Japan and a pickup in econom ic growth that is quite  modest.  And, of course, we’ve seen those projected pickups disappear in the past. This certainly says som ething, I think, about the effectiveness of their policy, not  just in 2001 but over the next two-plus years.  It surely has som e major economic im plications but po ssibly political im plications as well.  I wonder if you’d comm ent on that. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNS ON.  Prior to Septem ber 11th, I think the people in the International Division w ho closely watch Japan were try ing to talk them selves into be ing slightly m ore optim istic about Japan than we had been for a while, and we’ve been rather pessim istic all along.  We we re trying to see som e energy in the Koizum i refor m, although what the governm ent has done since the uppe r house election in July 10/2/01 26 disappoin ted us because instead of ru nning with the reform  and building o n it they seem ed to be backing of f and he mming and hawing.  But there were som e shreds of signs of things possibly not getting wors e at least.  It’s hard  to say whether Septem ber 11th will really chang e that for them.  There are no di rect implications for Japan ex cept for the loss in export potential from  the rest of the world and certainly from the United States.  I think they’re so bound up in their own problem s that I don’t have a sense--or they weren’t able to tell us is a  bette r way to put it--of  whet her the Tankan survey wa s heav ily inf luenced by the attacks or not. A significant portion of  the s urvey respo nses were re ceived by th e agency after Septem ber 11th, but they m ade no effort and really had no w ay to tell how many had been f illed ou t after Septem ber 11th. I think we are at risk of that econom y remaining moribund--sitting there m ore or less doing nothing for quite som e time--and largely for political reasons. Now, whether th at would spark a real political overturn in Japan I am  certainly not the person to say.  Obviously, in m ost other countries it would have happen ed long ago.   So it jus t defies m y ability to judge.   Personally,  I had thoug ht Koizum i might m ake a difference but I think ci rcum stances are consp iring agains t that at the pres ent tim e.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Dave, I was intrigued by the changes in your estim ates of structural productivity--1.9 percent in 2001, sl owing to 1.5 percent in 2002, and picking up to 1.8 percent in 2003. I know there ar e close relationships  between productivity, capital deepening, and business fixed invest ment and so forth.  We’ve been looking backward, but suppose we look forward and make  the assumption that the im petus to be 10/2/01 27 more and more productive and m ore focused on th e cost side is still very much present in U.S. industries. If we assum e that this is  not as much a function of capital deepening but increasingly a function of industrial reorgani zation or a sheer desire  to do things better and cheaper all the tim e, what would a s lightly higher and m ore stab le lev el of productivity growth do to your projections? I know you have that feedback effect into demand.  I’m interested in how that might look in the 2002-2003 tim e fram e. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOC KTON.  Basically, if we were to in crease th e multifacto r productivity portion, which is the portion that would provi de all the im petus that you were talking about, we would get stronger gr owth in activity brought  about probably by a stronger sto ck market than we have in the ba selin e forecast.  That stronger growth would probably be accom panied by very little add itional inflation.  In essence w e’d see an unwinding or a backing off of exactly the kinds of revisions that we think have occurred over the past year, as productivity cam e in w eaker than we an d others had  anticipated,  the stock m arket weakened, and dem and softened si gnificantly.  As I think you’ve noted on a number of occasions, on e som etimes needs to  look through th e snapshots of structural productivity that we have in this forecast. Indeed, even with this 1 percent growth in multifactor productivity , we would expect , moving beyond this period of cyclical weakness in investm ent spending, to see som e reacceleration of underl ying productivity.  But that occurs beyond the horizon that we cu rrently are forecasting.  Of course, we’ve made big m istakes in both directi ons in recent years, so it cer tainly cou ld be the ca se that things will turn out even better in the near term .  Businesses m ay be moving m ore aggressively on the cost-cutti ng side and m ay in essence ge t us back clos er to the production possibilities f rontier than we have  assum ed here.  And that would produce a 10/2/01 28 stronger eco nomy.  But because of less cost p ressures, it pro bably would  be accom panied by less upw ard pressure on inflation as well. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. And slightly lower unem ploym ent? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Yes, working it the way that we have told the story and the way the m odel sees it, we would get str onger near-term  demand effects than supply effects and that would produce somewhat lower unem ployment.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Further quest ions?  If not, who would like to start the Co mmittee dis cussion ?  Presiden t Mos kow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The tragic events of September 11th have had a profound im pact on the Sevent h District’s people,  businesses, and econom y.  The response in term s of t he giving of tim e, money, and blood has been inspiring. As for our District economy, overall activ ity was sluggish bef ore the terrorist attacks. Our weak m anufacturing sector ap peared to be nearing the bottom of its adjustm ent but contacts indi cated that consum er spending had softened.  The District econom y has clearly deteriorated  since the atta cks.  We’ve seen som e improvem ent from the near standstill conditions experienced around Septem ber 11th, but overall activity is still significantly lower than it was in Augus t and early September.  The impact on travel and tour ism has been pa rticularly dra matic.  Downturns a re evident no t only in a irline travel but across a large num ber of related industries such as hot els, restaurants, car rental agencies, taxi cabs, and airport concessions .  Contacts at Boeing told m e that m any airlines now  expect double-dig it declines in passenger tra ffic during the calendar year compared with a 2 percent decline in 1991 fo llowing the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  As a 10/2/01 29 result, Boeing expects aircraft  production cuts to be roughly four tim es as large as the cuts in the early 1990s. Tighter secu rity p rocedu res are evid ent ev erywhere, not just at airports.  They are af fecting  business a ctivity and lik ely will  continue to do so for som e time.  For exam ple, we  heard of 12- to 18-hour delays  at the U.S./Canadian entry points, which effectively reduced cross border trucking cap acity by a third in the week following the attacks. If such delays c ontinue, obviously they would ha ve a significant im pact on m any of our businesses, particularly the au tomobile  industry.  But as of late last week, waitin g times were reported to be very close to norm al.  That was one of the few good pieces of news I’ve heard recently. Consum er spending has definitely slowe d.  The sharp 50 to 70 percent sales some retailers continue to report double-digit declines.  Controlling i nventories is a m ajor concern and order cancellations are occurring more frequently, especially for apparel.  Expectations for the upcom ing holiday sales season have been lowered even further and are described as poor. Sales of autos and light trucks have al so slowed considerably and the weakness in car rentals is adversely a ffecting fleet sales.  Autom akers have responded by offering interest-free financing. Repor ts indicate that traf fic in  auto showroom s has been improving only slowly since Septem ber 11th and that autom akers will need to cut production schedules substantiall y.  One contact indicated a n eed to elim inate three to four weeks of production. 10/2/01 30More generally, reports from  our dir ectors and other contacts from  a broad range of industries have been decidedly gloom y.  Many cite anxiety and wait-and-see attitudes as restraining factors.   Most are planning for the wo rst and hoping for the better.  As a result, firm s are becom ing even more  cautious about capital spending, and m any have taken o r are s eriously consid ering taking ad dition al steps to reduc e costs and trim their workforces. Turning to the national outlook, at our August meeting it seem ed possible that the econom y could avoid a recession.  Cons umer spending seem ed to be holding up relatively well in the f ace of the inve stment-led slowdown.  But a m ajor concern was that a further drop in consumer confidence woul d set off a second wave of econom ic slowing.  In view of the layoff announcem ents and the st ock m arket declines following the terrorist attacks, it se ems certain now that co nsum er spending will d ecelerate f urther.  Increasing unem ployment will likely dim inish confidence fu rther.  Reductions in household wealth will a lso be a restra ining  factor.   The outlook for business investm ent continues to be poor.  Reductions in business con fidence and declin ing co rporate prof its will b e a drag on new capital investm ent decisions.  This may lead busine sses to believe they have an even larger capital ove rhang than th ey had prev iously perc eived.  The re st of the wor ld will no t be a stimulus for U.S. growth at this point, as we’ve discussed.  Instead, our dom estic slowing will con tinue to be a d rag on the glo bal econom y.  One positive note is the lack of inflationary pressures in today’s econom y.   Following the events of Septem ber 11th, the env ironm ent for form ulating monetary policy is m uch m ore com plex.  There is a series of new unknowns on which we 10/2/01 31 must m ake judgm ents, including the im pact on consum er confidence and spending, adverse disruptions to the physical and fina ncial operations of businesses, prospective fiscal s timulus, and the reaction of the fina ncial m arkets.  In addition, m ilitary action by the United S tates and an y further terror ist attacks will undoubtedly have s ignificant impacts on the econom y.  It will take seve ral m onths just to begin assessing these challenges. In the m eantim e, I believ e there continues to be a substantial downside risk that the current econom ic slowdown will unravel further.

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, econom ic activity in the Twelf th District was weak even b efore the terroris t attack s.  Employment contracted in July and then was nearly flat in August. On net it fell about 1 percent at an a nnual rate in the two m onths.  The m ain source of weakness was the hi gh-tech sector.  High-tech equipment manufacturers have been  shedding jo bs all year and the pace of decline accelerated substantially in July and August, with cuts at double-digit rates re ported in California, Arizona, and Oregon. High-tech service providers  also have been cutting jobs, including the loss of over 5 percent of em ploym ent in that sector in th e State of W ashington during The slowdown was also evident in other sectors such as c onstruction.  Vacancy rates for office space h ave risen substantially  in most m etro areas, and ho me sales and price appreciation have com e down a s well.  The slowdown in constr uction activ ity so far this ye ar is most eviden t in th e San Franci sco B ay area, where the num ber of perm its for new hom es is running 13 percent below last  year’s num bers.  Consum er spending and confidence in the District, which had been  holding up well in the spring and early 10/2/01 32 summer, showed signs of weakening in early  Septem ber.  Of course, these weaknesses have been exacerbated in the afterm ath of the attacks.   The imm ediate econom ic effects of the at tacks included substa ntial reductions in consum er spending and som e disruptions in  business ac tivity.  Since the n retail sales among large discount stores have recovered, though sales at departm ent stores have remained depressed.  As a result, for som e apparel m anufacturers clothing orders for spring reportedly are running well below pr e-attack expectations.  By contrast, construction  activ ity in recent weeks has not been  affected to any appreciable degree.  However, the postponem ent or cancellation of some projects m eans that the pipeline is not filling up as fast as before. The largest negativ e effects of the attack s have been on air travel and tourism , as was indicated by President Moskow. Due to the resulting bleak  outlook, Boeing--and I think our numbers about Boeing are sim ilar to those presented by President Moskow-- immediately cut its es timated deliveries of comm ercial aircraft next year by 20 percent, with substantial additional cu ts expected in 2003.  In Seattle as m any as 20,000 jobs could be lost at Boeing by the end of next year.  District con tacts have reported that airline bookings have been runni ng 50 percent or more below norm al.  And in cities like San Francisco, where 85 percent of the hotel de mand is derived from  arrivals by air, hotel occupancies are very low. As a result, s ubstantial layoffs are under way or planned by airports, airlines, and firm s in other segm ents of the travel indus try.  Although this has been f elt nationwide, the  impact will be espec ially hard on so me Twelf th District s tates that have unusually large tourism  and travel  sectors, notably Nevada and Hawaii, whose tourism  sectors had already begun to st ruggle prior to the attacks.    10/2/01 33Let m e turn to the na tional picture.  I certainly wo n’t take exce ption to the widely held view that th e terrorist attacks probably ended any chance of avoiding recession. In this regard , a m ember of our staff has taken a careful  look at the m onthly indicators and m ethods used by the NBER to da te recessions. He concludes that if, as seem s likely , activ ity falls enough in com ing m onths for the N BER to declare a recession, the busin ess cycle peak could we ll be backdated to the first ha lf of this year and perhaps as early as March. This date would repr esent a com promise among the unusually diverse peaks in the various data seri es that the NBER relies upon.   In any even t, our forecast for the second half  of this year is sim ilar to that of the Greenbook. It shows a sm all decline in r eal G DP in the third quarter and a drop of 1/2 to 1 percent in the fourth quarter. Assu ming a funds rate of 2-1/2 percent, the m ost likely scenario for next year seem s to be a gradual pickup in growth, especially in response to the easing of monetary policy as we ll as recent and expected f iscal actions.  However, while g rowth should be more accep table, it will lik ely rem ain well below the potential rate for som e time.  The excep tionally large risks su rrounding the outlook are skewed to th e weak side,  especially in view of the potential hit to confidence that would go along with likely m ilitary action and possible additional terrorism .  Another risk is the deepening stagnation of econom ies around the globe. We have rev ised down our inflation fo recast by about 1/2 percent since th e estim ate is f or inflation of about 1-1/2 pe rcent in the core PC E price index in 2002.  Given the econom ic outlook as well as its downs ide risks, there is a strong argum ent for 10/2/01 34 implementing the additio nal cut in th e funds ra te that underlies our forecast and that in the Greenbook. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. One of the m inor casualties of Septem ber 11th was our educated and inform ed views and knowledge regarding the state of the econom y.  That knowledge, such as it was, is now obsolete and th ere’s very little with which to replace it.  I agree that our economy will prob ably be oka y in the long run once we get pas t this unsettlem ent.  And I’m  fairly conf ident that the c onsequences  in the ve ry short term  will be seriou sly negativ e.  The econom y was alre ady teetering on the brink of recession an d this event has surely pushed it over that br ink.  What I don’t know is how deep and how long the recession will be--that is, the outl ook for the m edium term .  No one can know that now because it hasn’t been determ ined yet.  The length and depth of the recession will depend more on how everyone reacts  to wh at happened on Septem ber 11th than on the even t itself.  It’s h ard to im agine that the great uncertainty on all fronts won’t cause consum ers and businesses alike to withdraw  from new comm itments and to hunker down. We deal here in spending and income as m easured by GDP a nd its components, but we should not forget th at we are now poorer in ways beyond any estim ates of GDP m easures.  We will be poorer at each lev el of GDP than we were before to or thought we had will require m ore of our scarce resources to be devoted to security.  More policem en, firem en, airport security, bor der security, and air m arshals will be needed. They will gen erate m easured incom e or GDP, but their opportun ity cos ts will be large. 10/2/01 35We will also  be poorer as a resu lt of l onger lines and longer waits at airp orts, sporting eve nts, conce rts, and sim ply getting in a nd out of  public bu ilding s.  We will m iss out on a lot of good i mmigrants who won’t get into our countr y as we try to screen out the undes irable ones.  We will p robably ha ve to reintroduce s ome redundancies and inefficiencies that had been wrung out of th e econom y.  As Ed Yardeni put it, “just-in­time inventories m ay becom e just-in-case inve ntories.”  Backup and relocation s ites that will sit id le most of  the tim e will becom e more important, ev en essentia l.  Much of  this will con tribute to GDP but will repr esent a dow ngrading of  living s tandards.  Poore r will be the work ers who will have to postpone re tirem ent becau se their 401ks have tanked and the poten tial students wh o will have to enter the labor f orce rather than college.  I don ’t know how to add all these fact ors, along with the decline in  the stock m arket, into an estim ate of the size of th e negative wealth e ffect.  But I believe they will be im portant factors. As to the specific im pact on the Elev enth District, I don’t know m uch beyond the obvious. Most sectors and regions have  weakened.  American, Continental, and Southwest Airlin es are headquartered in Texas,  so we will feel th e decline in air trav el and related industries more than m ost areas. Our exports, especially to Mexico and Asia, are off. The declin e in energy prices  will rem ove a local positive, thank g oodness.  Natural g as is back down to $2.50 per m illion BT Us, half of last year’s p rice.  We probably do have som e firms that will bene fit from beefed up defense spending, but we should not forget that th at will rep resent a diversion of spending a nd not necessarily new spending. I’m told that Texas has about  500 m anufacturing firm s involved in the manufacture of instrum ents relating to research, detection, navigation, guidance, 10/2/01 36 aeronautical and nautical system s, as well as measuring and controlling system s.  We also have a significant regional pr esence of high-tech defense companies, such  as Northrop Grumm an, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Bell Textron.  The stock prices of the first three h ave risen since the  market reop ened.  Bell Textron’s h as not.  It is s till suf fering from  setbacks to the Osprey--the airplane that is supposed to land and take off like a helicopter and not require ai rports or flat terrain.  If they could just get that  plane to work, I know some places with bad terrain wher e they m ight be able to use it!   As for the national econom y and the policy question, I had been thinking that this year’s reduction in the funds rate from  6-1/2 to 3 percent plus all the extra liquidity that has been provided would probably be enough.  But the psychology of the financial however, by the nea r unanim ity in th e markets th at we will re duce the f unds rate by another 50 basis points today. The m arkets seem  insatiab le as well as f ragile!  I tend  to think som ething less would be sufficient, bu t it is an awkward tim e to disappoint the funds rate of 3 percent was the low point of the nom inal rate during the ’90-’91 recession.  But as the staff points out, the lower inflation rate today m akes the current fed funds rate about a percentage point higher in real term s.  Aside from the potential consequences of disappointing the m arket, I believ e the am ount of weight that we  give to that distinction between the nom inal and the real rate is probably the key to to day’s policy decision.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Poole.

MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Let me talk first about conditions as describ ed to m e by my various con tacts.  Because of the obvious im portance of consum er 10/2/01 37 confidence, I’ve had four conversations with  my contact at Wal-Mart since Septem ber 11th --on the 14th, 17th, 19th, and again yesterday.  His overall assessm ent is that s ales ar e holding up pretty well. On the Tuesday of the terrorist attacks, of course, sales at W al-As I talked with m y source sev eral more times, that was the basic m essage--th at sales were f airly c lose to wha t had been anticipated bef ore the day of the attacks.  Some changes in buying patterns have em erged that he doesn’t know com pletely how to explain. Wal-Mart tracks the num ber of sale s tickets and the average am ount spent p er sales tick et on a sam e-store basis to analyze d ata at com parable sto res.  He is seeing  more of a split be tween the volum e of traffic and tha t of ticke ts than usual; that is , there ’s a greater increase in the number  of tickets and less growth in  the am ount spent per ticket.  But as of yesterday, the total am ount spent wa s com ing in just slightly below what W al-My contact also said that the com pany has done a little research with som e focus groups regarding Christm as spending pl ans.  Of the consum er groups they’ve talked with, the percentage of respondent s who say they’re going to spend less for Christm as is about the sam e as the typical re sponse in their focus groups at this tim e of year. The p ercentage sa ying tha t they will be sp ending m ore, however, is down significantly. The proportion planning to spend about the sam e is therefore up significantly. He said--and I pressed him  som ewhat on this-- that he felt it was m uch too early to m ake any judgment about the longer -run outlook.  People are still very m uch in shock in term s of adjusting to the event.  In his view, drawing any conclusions is alm ost certainly prem ature at this point. My contacts in the air cargo business, at both UPS and FedEx, say that their companies are m aintaining their norm al schedules. They have not cut back at all as yet. Volum e is running somewhat below  where it had been, but not dram atically so overall.  However, the express business has been hard hit.  The ground business and what they call the freight business--which is  less than truckload quantitie s--is running about flat over last y ear.  emphasized that th e outlook for dom estic passenger airlines is truly dire. He said that as a consequen ce of the very stiff labor contracts that were settled in stages over last year and this year  before Septem ber, labor costs have increased very significantly. would be the first of the airlines to fail.  From looking at the financial reports , that airline already has negative net worth for the shareholders on its books. And, of course, they ’re all in junk bond status.                    At current traffic levels all of them are literally within a few w eeks of running out of cash and having to close down. So, the situation is ve ry dire for the passenger airlines.  And, of course, we heard this m orning that  Swiss Air has declared bankruptcy. I also m ade a new contact with a pers on at a trucking firm  called J.B. Hunt, which is headquartered in Arkansas and is one of the largest trucking companies in the United States. Hunt’s business is very m uch at norm al levels, with volume generally what they had expected. But the compa ny is greatly concerned about the f uture, particularly the early part of  next year.  For the m ost part, buying plans for the fall are already completed, so the inventories are m oving to the stores.  But there’s a very large amount of uncertainty about what  will h appen early nex t year. 10/2/01 3810/2/01 39Let m e divide m y comments on the total economy into two parts.  First, I think it’s fair to say that very little is know n at the professi onal level about the sentim ent question. I think back to m y readings of the journal literature  over a long period of studying m acroeconom ics and I don’t rem ember ever seeing articles about consum er sentim ent ex cept in conjunction with  the se ntiment surveys.  There’s p ractically no analysis of sentim ent at a pr ofessional level.  I think we  can say, though, that we have some basis for understanding the econom ic aspect s of the current situation.  It seem s to me important to focus on the fact that som e major funda mental strengths w ere in place at the tim e of the attacks.  We had an envir onment of low inflation and very low expected inflation. Oil prices had been m oving lowe r and, of course, have com e down further since the attacks and th at is an elem ent of st rength.  We go into this  situation with strong bank capital, unlike the situation in 1990- 91 when bank capital was weak.  Banks can make loans.  And, of course, low short-term  rates increase the m argin for banks to compensate for the greater risk in this envi ronm ent.  We have  a federal budget surplus, which m eans that the budget is not as big an issue as it m ight have been a dozen years ago in term s of the nature of a federal respons e.  We had a very large am ount of m onetary stimulus already in place as of September 11th. Our economy operates with very flexible issue, I thin k, is how lo ng it’s go ing to take  for businesses and consum ers to get over it, so to speak, and to adju st to this circu mstance.  And we have very, very little by way of knowing the answer to that. From  looking at the effects on the stock market of past shock events--and I went back and exam ined as m any as I could th ink of--the longest peri od of recovery from 10/2/01 40 a shock was after the stock m arket crash in 1987.  It took quite a while for the m arket to get back to where it h ad been.  After the i nvasion of Kuwait, the m arket was depressed until Des ert Storm  and that even t tended to reso lve that issue .  In the cu rrent situation , we are likely to see m ore shocks to com e.  Almost certainly there are going to be som e terrorist events abroad. Let’s pray that no more com e to our own land.  But m ore shocks lie ah ead tha t will pos sibly upset con fidence.   I’m going to delay talking about our polic y situation, but I th ink the issue there is that we need to focus much, m uch m ore than we usually d o on the con fidence issu e.  We need to focus on what we can do to help  support confidence and stability ra ther than just on the setting of the federal funds rate itself.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Let m e start with a quick rundown of what’s going on in the District econom y.  Much of  this was in the wr itten report we subm itted earlier, althou gh I do have som e updates.  Production was largely unaffected by the events of September 11th, and that is still the cas e today.  On the other hand, consum er spending in the first few days follo wing the attacks was essentially stopped in its tracks. But reports from  large retailers in  the District suggest that sales bounced back quite quickly. Now, I’m not talking about big- ticket item s.  This is exclusive of autos and hom es and so forth.  But activity at m alls--at discount stores and even departm ent stores --cam e back rather quickly  to norm al levels.  I guess it ’s also f air to say tha t restaurants in the District have been surprisingl y busy, at least in the la st couple of weeks.  Housing activity, which had been sound, rem ains sound.  But as I reported at the last meeting, sales at the high end of the m arket certainly seem ed to be slowing, and that 10/2/01 41 continues to be the case. My sense is that there is grow ing caution in that area and I would be surprised if next year’s housing ac tivity in the Dis trict cam e anywhere clos e to the pace of the las t two o r three years . For the m ost part, nonresidential constr uction activity has continued unabated.  There was, of course, a m ajor expansion of  the airport under way and that project has slowed if not been put o n hold.  I don’t th ink that situ ation will go on for too long unless people are p repared jus t to let the p roject rust as it sits there.  There have been a lo t of cancellations of prospective conventions. September and October are very big convention months in Minneapolis, so that matters a good deal.  The hotels are running with low occupancy rates and other travel-related businesses are sim ilarly  affected.  The airports that I’ve been in at least have been very quiet, although Northwest Airlines has reported som e improve ment in future bookings.  I’m not sure exactly what to m ake of that, but the airline people s eem som ewhat surprised about what’s com ing down the pike.   Obviously, the business community is of the opinion in general that aggressive action both on the fiscal side and on the m oneta ry policy side is appropriate here.  I don’t have to go very far out the door to hear somebody in the business comm unity offer that opinion. One other developm ent is that in the wake of all this, we lost one m edium -sized brokerage firm  that was involved in an ill-advised securities lending transaction. As far as the national econom y is con cerned, in thinking a bout the outlook and in listening to the staff discussion, the key word  here is obviously un certainty.  I happen to think that the near-term outlook is for m ore weakness th an projected in the Greenbook, but I wouldn ’t put too much stock in any forecast.   As many people have a lready s aid, we’re in an environm ent that we really  don’t know a lot about.  Norm ally, when 10/2/01 42 uncertainty goes up, that im plies to m e the need for policy caution so as to avoid signif icant errors.  But in  the cur rent situa tion we  can be fairly  certain-- or at least I am of the opinion--that the downside risks have m agnified and that the inflation risks have diminished.  In any event though, I’m not sure that econom ic policy is going to be key to the relatively near-term  future.  I think what  we need is tranq uility at hom e and succes s abroad.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, the econom y in the Tenth Distri ct, like that for the nation, rem ains sluggish.  Some people m ight say it was m ixed at best prior to the events of Septem ber 11th. Of course since then, as we ’ve heard around this table, the anxiety and uncertainty that was already in  the econom y took an even greater hit and caused the outlook to worsen noticeably, as re flected in the Greenbook as well as in our staff and the Blue Chip forecas ts.  Let m e give you som e data on the District .  These developm ents are consistent with the national news b ecause m any of the reports are from  firm s operating nationally.  First of all, the m anufactur ing survey we conducted in July w as quite negative.  Our dispersion index was m inus 28.  When we t ook a look at the August survey, we becam e somewhat hopeful because that negative had becom e much sm aller, m oving to m inus 7.  But in September--and p art of the su rvey was clearly done after Septem ber 11th --tha t index went back to m inus 16.  So we saw a big switch in sentim ent in term s of the prospects looking forward. On the transportation side, I would make a couple of points. As for the airlines, our experience is the sam e as othe rs have talked about.  Boeing, which has 10/2/01 43 operations in W ichita, has announced significant layoffs.  But as a side comment, Cessna, which also operates there, has a backlog on orders for corporate aircraft.  And that backlog is growing, apparently reflecting in creased dem and for fractional ownership as the des ire to find alte rnative air tr ansportation is star ting to take hold. Let m e talk for just a m inute about the trucking industry.  Bill Poole m entioned a firm  in that sector.  In Kansas City we also hav e a large nati onally operating trucking company that does a lot of shipping for m anufacturing firm s.  We recently  had a conversation with their people, and they said  the firm ’s business is down m arkedly.  It was down noticeably prior to September 11th and since then it has only gotten worse, as their custom ers have pulled back.  Their co mment to m e was that they are now operating at 1985 levels of business. So, they have had very significant reductions in volum e and have just announced sizable layoffs. They ha ve about 10,000 drivers and have laid off a significan t number of them as well as  staff in their corporate o perations.   Looking at the railroad industry, we ha ve a m ajor railroad operating north- south from  Kansas City and then into Mexic o.  Their volum es in and out of Mexico have dropped noticeably and their ord er books have dropped as well.  Previous to Septem ber 11th they had initiated layoffs, and there are no signs of rehiring at this point.    As for the retail sector, like others we’v e talked to m any retailers.  They have reported a fairly persistent re turn to the pre-September 11th pattern in terms of sales. But the experience is very mixed as they look to the Christ mas season.  Some are saying they’ve pu lled back dram atically.  One, as  was reported in the national press, followed through com pletely in their Christm as orders as  their sales w ere up 25 percent.  So w e’ve heard very m ixed reports on the retail side.  10/2/01 44Energy, which for us is a two-edged sword, is also a m ix.  Because prices are down that’s good in the general se nse.  But it also m eans that we’ve seen a real drop-off in activity in our region; it’s dow n about 10 percent by our estim ate. Generally, activity in our region is sl ower.  The change in psychology is noticeable, in term s of the effects. Looking to the national situation and polic y, I would say that we also see the econom y recovering eventually.  But gi ven the psychology and the uncertainty, forecasting the tim eline for the recov ery is ex ceedingly difficult.  I would n’t pretend to have a better forecast than anyone else in th is roo m; mine would be no better than Dave Stockton’s, f or sure. Another factor m entioned he re that I think is an im portant consideration is fiscal policy. We don’t know how that’s going to evolve.  Trying to pull all this together, I would be supportive of an easing--pick th e amount.  I think an  easing step would recognize that at least for th e next several m onths the dow nside risks are probably going to weigh very heavily on our economy. Our expe rience in other instances, as people have pointed out, is that we tend to underestim ate the downside.  In my view that is a real possibility in this case as well. So I would be more inc lined to e rr on the side of easing.  We can reverse the easing s hould fiscal policy be overly stimulative or should the econom y turn up, and I believe the m arket w ould understand that.  I think we are in a good position in that regard. So overall a cas e for easing policy can be well supported, if that should be deem ed necessary here.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Minehan. 10/2/01 45

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Than k you, Mr. Chairm an. All of the available data on New England suggest that the regi onal econom y slowed, possibly at  an increasing rate, in the period since our last Open Market Committ ee m eeting.  Employm ent declined between The value of m anufactured expor ts declined, especially com puters and electronics, and consum er and business confidence fell substant ially.  But thes e data a lmost entire ly predate the tragic events of Septem ber 11th. What feel we have for developm ents in  the regio n since that tim e therefore relies m ore on anecdotal sources than scienc e.  I certainly understand Dave Stockton’s comment about the desire to speak less when there is little science on one’s side, but I feel com pelled to explo re the anecdo tal reports  that we have heard.  At our Bank we had the benefit of hearing from those who a ttended tw o regularly scheduled advisory comm ittee m eetings--o ur sm all business and ou r academ ic advisory cou ncils--and two regularly scheduled bankers’ forum s, all of which took place after September 11th. In addition, both before and after the tragedy, I spoke personally to several of  the Bank’s directors outside of regular m eetings and to  the C EOs of several large m anufacturing and financial services com panies.  And, of c ourse, we had the additional post-Septem ber 11th calls to Beige Book contacts. Several th emes emerged from  these interactions. First, econom ic activity across a wide sample of firm s and industries was slowing even in advance of Septem ber 11th, though not all the news was bad. The strong dollar and slowing dem and had contributed to problem s at m any regional m anufacturers, including one large wo rldwide m anufacturer of consum er products.  The U.S. forest product industry was reported by one contact to  be on the verge of collapse, despite the  10/2/01 46 strong hous ing m arket, largely b ecause of in creas ed foreign com petition related to th e strong dollar and excess capacity put in place in the early to  mid-1990s.  The head of a regional software industry council reported on the dem ise of hundreds of firm s in the wake of the drying up of dem and, es pecially fo r Internet-related soft ware.  But she also reported that new start-ups were being for med as well, in fields such as wireless communication and teleconferen cing.  Similarly, regional bu sinesses in the field of security saw  the poten tial for som e benef it in the near term , and a few had already seen a pickup in dem and.  Many contacts reported a very welcom e softening in labor m arkets and the ab ility to a ttract technica l staf f easily for the first tim e in recent years.  Housing reductions from  very high levels of activity earlier. Second, the im pact of the tragedy of Septem ber 11th was significant both cultu rally an d econom ically but at least som e aspects of the econom ic jolt will be sho rt lived. A highly rated large m anufacturer of airplane engines and consumer and industrial building products commented that access to com mercial paper m arkets had been difficult during the week of the tragedy but that m arkets had m ore or less returned to norm al, at least for very short m aturity paper.  Small manufacturers and supplie rs of retail goods had experienced an imm ediate drop-off in dem and.  And bankers noted that traffic in branches cam e to a halt in the days following the tragedy.  By the following weekend, however, shoppers had returned to malls. One specialty food and flower vendor, whose business had been disrupted by a lack of ai rplane shipm ents of i mported goods, reported that s ales for Rosh Hashanah broke a ll prev ious re cords.  Families crowded  his sto res, 10/2/01 47 apparently in a desire both to be together and to enjoy the simple process of getting ready for the holiday. There were, of course, important exceptio ns to this im pression of short-term disruption. The airline engine m anufacturer I mentioned noted that e ach engine is sold three tim es--once as a new produc t and twice in the for m of parts in the after-m arket.  With airline traffic down and likely to stay  depressed, this execu tive thought that new orders would be curtailed shar ply and that the number of pa rked aircraft would swell to perhaps twice the cu rrent num ber, which was al ready at the level of the last recession.  He also expressed som e concerns about the am ount of supplier credit his firm  had extended to air lines. Another hard hit area is likely to be the New England tourism  industry.  The econom ic slowdown ha d already eaten into th e “leaf peeping” season, but the dram atic buses of tourists to a halt. Reportedly ther e has been an increase in Eas tern seaboard touris ts looking to r elax a car d rive a way rathe r than an airplane flight away.  But tourism in the region and particularly in Boston rem ains low.  The f all touris t inflow is a m ainstay to the region and its demise m ay involve m ore than short-run disruption. Finally, all contacts saw prospects for the imm ediate future as more than unusually u ncertain.  Mem bers of the academ ic advisory g roup noted the difficulty of finding a historical com parison on w hich to base forecasts an d they debated both the possible size and im pact of fiscal stimulus.  Some felt that the potential f or spending on homeland defense and o n new m ilitary weapons, such as des troyers and planes, could be considerable. A few also saw the potential for an inflationary im pact from a supply 10/2/01 48 shock related to m oving substantial resources to fighting terrorism , if de mand for m ore usual consum er products did not abate consider ably.  Most, however, did not see inflation as a current worry and focused m ore on th e likelihood of negative rates of econom ic growth for two to three quarters. In sum , shoc k, increased uncertainty, a nd turm oil, however short-lived, have been piled onto a regional econom y that had be en holding on to growth by its fingernails.  It’s not a pretty picture. Turning to the nation al scene, the p icture doesn’t get m uch better.  Whether one looks at the Greenbo ok or the forecasts of DRI, the Blue C hip, or our B ank, the outlook is the sam e--two or three quarters of m ildly ne gative growth, a rebound over 2002 to rates of growth at a bout potential in 2003, and sharply rising unemploym ent.  Even withou t the trag ic events of Septem ber 11th, the prospects for this year and next would have been less po sitive today than they appeared in August.  This was clear from the summ er’s industrial production data a nd em ploym ent and confidence indicators. But sadly, the events of Septem ber 11th happened and the slowing economy received a serious negative shock. The obvious questions are how serious and how negativ e, bu t the an swers are m ore than norm ally uncertain.  We have very little data as yet to go on and not m uch in the way of hist ory to guide us.  The Greenbook expects the dip into negative territory to be relatively short and m ild in nature, with consum ption never actually turning negative.  That’s fairly unu sual if  in fact this is to be  the f irst recess ion of the new m illennium .  I’m forced to wonder whether we are not engaged in a form of wishful thinking--the sam e process that has pushed the rec overy out further in time in our forecas t at ev ery successive meeting this year.  Corporate profits, 10/2/01 49 employm ent, asset m arkets, consum er spendi ng, business investm ent, and confidence all present elem ents of increasing downside ri sk.  Moreover, the c onfluence of weakness both here an d abroad, while no t unprecedented, is  not com forting either.  Thus, there are real risks that the baselin e forecast h as more than the norm al amount of downside potential. Offsetting th is, of course,  is the likeli hood of additional fiscal stim ulus.  Again, questions ab ound.  How much stim ulus will be  enacted, when will it affect the econom y, and how will it b e seen b y financial m arkets?  The Greenbo ok provides a reason ed estim ate of the am ount of such stim ulus.  But even the am ount included in that forecast seem s small rela tive to th e rheto ric co ming out of Washington.  In that regard, I wish I understood better what the shape of the yield curve m ight be telling us about the risks over the m edium  term.        The other potential offset is the degree  of m onetary ease.  We’ve reduced the federal funds target by 3 50 basis points since Ja nuary.  That’s a m uch faster pace than in the early 1990s when it took a couple of years to im plement about that sam e amount of change. Moreover, 75 basis points of that easing was done over the last few weeks and arguably has not worked its way into the ec onom y.  But with the decline in the stock as our degree of policy easing m ight im ply.  Earlier this year the consum er was the mainstay of the econom y, bolstered by lower in terest rates, and it was reasonable to be concerned about overdoing such low rates over  the near term .  Now, both consum ption and inves tment face the headwinds o f further diminished confidence, g rowing 10/2/01 50 uncertainty, and falling dem and.  Fiscal stim ulus, if properly f ashioned and tem porary, can help. But at leas t in the nea r term, monetary policy should do m ore as well.

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. The Atlanta District’s economy continued to weaken during the third quarter even prior to Septem ber 11th. And like elsewhere, activ ity has w eakened further in m ost sectors since that tim e.  Auto sales are off and comm ercial real estate markets continue to soften.  The m ost noticeable effects  of the attacks are being felt in Florid a, whic h had been our region’s growth leader.  As widely reported and as almost everyone ha s comm ented already this m orning, uncertainty and perceived travel risk have  hit tour ism and the hospita lity sector particularly hard.  Tourism  spending in Flo rida is repo rtedly down by about one-third, o r $20 million a d ay.  Disney W orld in Orlando has shortened its operating hours, elim inated overtim e, and reduced vending activities. Several large South F lorida hotels have cut staffing by as much as 30 percen t.  And the excess cruise ship capacity I m entioned in my reports earlier this year is now sinking parts of that industry.  Reflec ting the decline in travel, our larges t airlines, Delta an d AirT ran, have engaged in different  mixes of ver y aggressive cost-cutting m easures including job cuts , lower m anage ment bonuses, and reduced retirem ent contributions.  And in som e instances pilots have taken voluntary pay cuts. Employm ent cuts will es pecially affect Georgia, which m ay actually see som e Reflecting the job situation, requests for cons umer credit counseling in Georgia were at record levels in August. One of our Atlant a directors who runs a very large statewide consum er credit counseling organization reporte d that appointm ents for counseling were 10/2/01 51 up 5 percent in Septem ber from  the month be fore and jum ped another 15 percent after manufacturing sector, w hich continues to contra ct.  Investm ent plans reportedly are s till very m uch on hold until the signs of a pickup in new orders becom e apparent. District auto producers reported that  unit sales are ar ound 15 to 20 percent below plan following Septem ber 11th, even with the introduction of new incentive program s and new m odels.  Tennessee-base d Nissan is revising down its sales and production projections for the rem ainder of th e year and has elim inated all overtim e for the foresee able future.  Auto parts d elivery problem s experienced by plants in our area immediately after the attacks have n ow been res olved. State govern ments now face anoth er round of budget difficulties b ecause of slowing loan dem and ac ross all business lines, some tightening of cr edit standards, and some deterioration of credit quality.  Finally, I’d note the unusual report f rom several sources that m ajor corporations who had m ade previous charitable financial comm itments have begun seeking ways to gracef ully shift their gifts to next year or to pare them  back significantly. On the bright side, retail sales and reside ntial rea l estate markets are ou r best perform ing sectors.  While comm ercial m arkets continue to softe n, single-fa mily real estate rem ains reasonably strong.  Few signifi cant im balances in ei ther residential or commercial m arkets are appearing.  Many co mpanies are cutting hours for tem porary help. Wage pressures are reported to be significant only for health-care workers.  10/2/01 52 Likewise, substantial prices increases are ge nerally lim ited to  the hea lth-care se ctor an d to liability insurance p remiums, wh ich have risen sharply of late. On the national front, as alm ost ever yone has said, uncertainty is now the dominant consideration whether one focuses on financial m arkets or the real sector.  It’s now clear th at sign ifican t slow ing wa s eviden t in the th ird qua rter even bef ore Septem ber 11th. All things considered, I am  a bit m ore op timistic than s ome that the  shocks f rom the terro rist attacks will b e relatively les s pervasive and less lon g-lasting, aside from  the obvious effects on areas such as travel and to urism.  Having said that, uncertainty has clearly in creased and m arkets are exp ecting a fu rther drop in our target  funds rate at this meeting.  A further tem porary drop in rates seem s appropriate--but I em phasize the w ord “tem porary”--as a short-term  effort to provide  liquidity and attem pt to reduce uncer tainty.  Unlike the econom ic situation preceding the Gulf W ar, we’ve already dropped rates eight tim es and significant stimulus is in the pipeline. Arguably the real funds rate is now very low and will be approaching zer o according to som e measures, if we m ake another large reduction today. I don’t see a clear argum ent fo r pursuing such a low real rate po licy a t this tim e as an inte rmediate po licy p ath, given th e curr ent bes t guesses about the likely course of the economy, except to tem per furt her short-term  uncertainty.  Nevertheless, this does not seem  a good tim e to add to uncertainty by not relaxing rates further as th e markets expect. My concern about the policy path is hei ghtened by the belief that m ore fiscal stimulus than already en acted s eems quite likely and will tak e hold about the tim e many forecasts ind icate that the econom y will b egin to grow again.  Current perceptions in some quarters seem  to be that the White House, Congress, and even the Fed will do 10/2/01 53 almost anything to try to avoid a recessi on or a prolonged slowdown.  Quite candidly, this worr ies m e more than a m odest recessi on itself.  For these reasons, should we m ove again at this tim e--and I believe we should--we n eed to look f or ways to explain that it’s a temporary response that will likely b e revers ed when uncertainty declines and m arkets are m ore norm al.  Absent such an explanati on, I’m concerned that the policy path will put the econom y at sign ificant longe r-term  inflation risk, with all the cos ts and difficulties that we understand will be associated with that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

MR. SANTOMERO. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Prior to the attacks, the Third District econom y had been flat.  Employment continued to decline in the first two months of the third quarter. The m anufacturing sector also continued to  decline, albeit at a slower pace than earlier in the year. Retail sales rem ained flat.  One sign of a rebound in activity was an upturn in the pace of resident ial construction from  a we ak first quarter.  Our calls to business con tacts since the Septem ber 11th attacks indic ate that f irms in all industries in the region have revised downward their forecast s of sales and revenues in light of continuing uncertainty  about possible m ilitary act ion and a retrenchm ent in spending by consum ers and businesses.   Retailers have noted a resum ption of c onsum er spending since the initial days after the attacks but th ey say that sto re traffi c and sales hav e not returned to the lev els experienced prior to Septem ber 11th. Contacts am ong general m erchandise retailers expect sales to rise only sl owly in th e weeks imm ediatel y ahead.  Managers of local stores of national chains indica te that corporate marketing plan s for the fall have been put on hold, at least tem porarily, though fall and winter m erchandi se stocking levels have 10/2/01 54 already been set and are subjec t to only m inor adjustm ent.  But som e retailers who need to place orders now for spring m erchandise  are contem plating reductions from  their earlier p lans. Auto sales in the District had been sl owing in the weeks before Septem ber 11th, and in the d ays af ter the  attacks they  fell to levels 20 to 40 pe rcent b elow sam e-day sales last y ear.  Auto dealers tell us that th ey w ill be re ducing the ir orders to m anufacturer s for at least the next m onth or two.  Obviously, the travel and tourism  industries have been hard hit by recent ev ents.  In Philad elphia all the convention s scheduled fo r Septem ber after the attacks were canceled. The conve ntions scheduled f or October have not yet been cancelled but atten dance will b e lower th an norm al since som e companies hav e disallowed air travel for at least 30 days. In term s of employm ent, while m any firms in the region a re anticipating slower sales only a few are c onsidering layoffs, and m ost of these were contem plating layoffs before Septem ber 11th. Much m ore than the usual level of uncertainty surrounds the forecast for the reg ional econom y.  What is clear is th at recent ev ents have pushed the projected rebound further into the f uture than previously thought.   Our view of the national econom y is som ewhat the sam e.  The incom ing data suggest that prior to Septem ber 11th the econom y had rem ained soft.  The terrorist attacks on the United States h ave probably p ushed the econom y into recession.  These unpreceden ted attacks h ave raised th e specter of further shocks, such as U.S. m ilitary action and more terrorist strikes. While we’ve seen som e rebound in consum er spending from  the depressed levels in the days just after the atta cks, the re has not been a total recovery. Uncertainty about the future will  cause consum ers to delay som e purchases 10/2/01 55 and to cancel others. While r eal estate and oth er assets certainly have cushioned the negative effects on household net w orth, the signif icant fall in equity prices could result in a substantial decline in household spe nding.  Uncertainty and a drop in consum er spending will cause businesses to delay capital outlays. The economic situation abroad has also de teriorated since our last m eeting, as we heard in the staff briefing. Data suggest that these econom ies were weaker prior to the attacks than we had anticip ated.  And though not on their so il, the terroris t attacks are a negative shock to econom ies outside the Un ited States.  Thus, th is country cannot look to strong econom ies abroad to buoy our own econom y.   Our near-term outlook is sim ilar to that  of the Greenbook.  We agree that the attacks will have a sign ificant n egative im pact in the short run.  However, I believe there could be so me upside risks associated with the Greenbook’s forecast fo r 2002.  The effects of the terrorist attacks on consum er and business confidence m ay fade m ore quickly than assum ed.  Expansionary fiscal policy in com bination with easier m onetary policy m ay have a stronger im pact than assum ed.  Indeed, a Philadelphia staff analysis suggests that forecasters tend to under-pre dict the response of output grow th to expansionary m onetary policy.  Thus, it is possible that the econom ic recovery could begin earlier in 2002 and end up stronger than  projected in the Greenbook.  This would imply that the Comm ittee would have to be ready to raise intere st rates sooner than assum ed in the baseline forecas t.  That sai d, I fin d it difficult to argue with the bas ic outlin es of the Board’s s taff forecast.   Phila delphia staff analy sis ind icates that while forecasters s ignifican tly revised their forecasts downward in the afterm ath of past cris es, forecast erro rs were little different du ring cris is periods than in other perio ds.  So, as 10/2/01 56 much as I would lik e to, I am  unable to say th at the Greenbo ok forecast s urely errs on  the downside. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broadd us, will you continue for us? 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chai rman.  Econom ic activity in our District seem s to have advan ced at a m odest pace in Augus t but it weakened sharply in activity would have slowed in September even in the absence of the attacks.  Of course, we did have the attacks and they’ve had the sam e extrem ely negative im pact on our region as they’ve had elsewhere in the c ountry, as we’ve heard around the table this morning. Part of the drop in activity in our  region m ight be tem porary, if the terrorist threat can be reasonably well contained. As several others have noted about thei r Districts, we too experienced a big drop in re tail sales in itially but in g eneral they ’ve com e back to earlier lev els sin ce th en.  The exception is autom obile sales, which ha ve rebounded som e but not  to the levels we were seeing before the attacks occurred. In the m anufacturing  sector, early on there w ere some supply disruptions and som e disruptions in  shipm ents to custom ers, but at least for the tim e being those seem to have subsided.  In our region as else where the big hit, and probably the m ore perm anent hit, is to the trav el and tourist industrie s.  Tourist activity here in W ashington is usually ve ry substantial at this tim e of the year and it is at a m uch lower level now than norm ally. 10/2/01 57 With respect to the a irlines,              the airline h eadquartered in our District, ju st on the other side of the Potom ac river.  It was an airline in trouble- -its condition was very shaky --even b efore the crisis.  The com pany has announced 1 1,000 layoffs and a lo t of those will be in our District. I think a good n umber of them will be  right here in the W ashington area.  Also, beyond the layoffs, the US Airways hub in Charlotte has for a long tim e been a foundation for the growth and strength we’ve seen in that city over the last 15 years or so.  So there is concern about that area. With respect to the national econom y, I th ink the data indicated pretty clearly that economic activity might be weakening even  before the attacks.  We had a run-up in the unem ploym ent rate and, of course, m anufacturing was still contracting despite the somewhat optim istic purchasing m anagers’ re port we got a month ago.  With wages and home values rising, consum er spending was still holding up reasonably w ell going into the cr isis.  But the sh arp incre ase in u nemploym ent and evidence that housing dem and and hom e prices m ight be beginning to soften have contributed to the deterioration in consum er confidence that I think was eviden t even before the terrorists struck.   Against this background, the Septem ber 11th attacks, of course, have added to the anxiety and uncertainty that households, bus iness firm s, and investors were to some extent already experiencing before the att acks occurred.  Those concerns showed up initially in a sset m arkets .  The negative im pact on asset m arkets appe ars at least for the mom ent to be reasonably well contained unde r the circum stances, but obviously the level of anxiety in those m arkets is still very high.  With a recession increasingly likely, consum ers feel exposed to the risk of  losing their jobs as well as to other risks and, 10/2/01 58 therefore, are likely to s pend less an d save m ore out of current incom e in order to build their precautionary balances.  And businesses, whose invest ment returns are now subject to a gre ater degree of  risk than bef ore the attack s, will prob ably cut ba ck on their investm ent plans even f urther than th ey already have, at leas t for a tim e. Barring any further attacks and resulti ng increase in anxiety, som e of these effects m ay prove tem porary.  As households get their precautionary  balances and asset position s back up to the higher level they m ay now desire, pr esum ably they will ag ain begin to spend a m ore norm al fraction of th eir current incom e.  And when business firm s get to the po int where th ey think the y have sufficient liquidity to deal with the contingen cies they’re co ncerned abo ut, presum ably they will begin to redirect a greater portion of their earnings to investm ent.   Even so, it seem s clear to m e that the downside risk in the near-term  outlook is significantly greater than  the upside risk, at least for th e tim e being.  I don’t really see much upside risk in this situation, and I th ink we need to recognize that a significant cumulative contraction can’t be ruled out even in the absen ce of further terrorist activ ity. In ligh t of this risk, I th ink it’s wor th noting that the Greenbook is projecting a relatively m ild and brief recess ion en ding in th e first qu arter o f next year.  In my view it’s a plaus ible p oint forecast.  One reaso n it’s plausible is that ec onom ic policy and other public policies at the m oment are well posi tioned to cushion the downturn that we curren tly an ticipate.  Tax cuts are in p lace; rebates have been paid out; and there’s a good likelihood th at military s pending will increase.  We’re lik ely to see m ore public sp ending on security here at home. Perhaps most im portantly though, thanks to our actions over the la st dec ade or m ore, the Fed gene rally as an institu tion--and Fed m onetary po licy 10/2/01 59 specif ically--probably h as as m uch credibility f or low inf lation as it h as ever had.  And inflation expectations have b een declining so far this year.  This to m e is the big difference b etween the situation we face toda y and the one we faced in the early 1990s.  Consequently, I think we can probably m ove in terest rates still lower witho ut trigger ing an inflation scare in bond markets.  The question Cathy Mi nehan raised about what the bond m arkets are telling us with regard to infl ation expectations is a very relevant one.  But there are obviously other potential plau sible explanations for what has been happening in bond m arkets. The Greenbook projection assum es anothe r 1/2 point cut in the funds rate before the end of this year. Frankly, I th ink there’s a strong case to go ahead and m ake that m ove this m orning.  Having said that, I must say that I believe Jack G uynn m ade a very good point. We have been easing aggressively.  I have favored this and I’m comfortable with it. And I would be co mfortable with m ore easing this morning precisely because of our enhanced credibilit y.  But once a recovery gets under way--and sooner or later that’s go ing to happen--I think we’re go ing to  need to rev erse cou rse and move in the other direction just  as ag gressiv ely as we’ve ease d.  That will be necessary in order to m aintain our credibility, and in m any wa ys I think that’s the m ost im portant thing we have going for us in this situation. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Jordan.

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Let m e begin wi th autos.  Last week on an Executive C ommittee co nference call one of our directors,  a banker, reported on a conversation with one of his custom ers, an  auto dealer.  The dealer told the banker that over the prior weekend, Septem ber 22-23, only four custom ers even cam e into the 10/2/01 60 showroom  and he had no sales at all.  We, of course, were intere sted in following up on that, so people on our staff called auto d ealers around the District yesterday to get inform ation on their traffic a nd sales this past weekend.  Comparing notes on what they heard, the staff’s general consensus was that auto dealers were happily surprised not only by how m uch traffic they had but by how  strong sales were for the weekend.  Nevertheless, when asked how sales were lik ely to com e out for the m onth overall, the typical response was that sales were down a bout 20 to 25 percent versus a year ago.  However, and this is a point I’m  going to com e back to in a mom ent, it is very hard to discern a tre nd in anyth ing at th is sta ge and w ill be until the passage of  a little m ore tim e. Another of our directors runs a com pany that m akes pastries both for retail use and f or what they ca ll institutiona l use--th at is, sa les to res taurants and a irlines.  Last week she said that all s ix of her airlin e custom ers had called and cancelled all orders for onboard service for the foreseeable future.  Two of the com pany’s other lines are corporate gift giving, which usually involves gifts to em ployees or suppliers, and individual gift giving by retail custom ers.  They have had st rong sales in individual gifts of pastries but a 50 percent drop in orders  from  corporations.  So one can’t draw conclusions about any over all trend from  that.   We’ve been staying in weekly con tact with representatives of Federated Departm ent Stores.  As you know, of course, Federated reported very  sharp declines in sales imm ediately after S eptem ber 11th. This last weekend, fo r the four-day selling period Thursday through Sunday, sales were back on plan except in New York City.  Again, one cannot discern any trend f rom that because for the mont h overall sales will be down very considerab ly.  Our contac ts were ve ry encouraged,  however--w e talk ed to 10/2/01 61 them  yesterday--by the volum e of tr affic and sales over the weekend.  Nevertheless, they now expect the fourth quarter to be w eaker  than p revious ly an ticipated.  There’s no t much they can do about that. They are curr ently ordering for next year and they’re going to order less for the spring than they previously thought they would. Yesterday I received the raw data and a prelim inary summary of the September survey of the National Fede ration of Independent Busine sses.  You know how they do that survey; through the course  of the m onth they get res ponses to a lot of different questions and then they try to distill the in form ation and summ arize it.  Those data, too, show the difficulty of drawing any conclusi ons about the trend.  Almost half of the responses they received were  dated prior to September 11th and a little over half were dated after Septem ber 11th. Based on the survey responses dated prior to the 11th, the analysts would have drawn the conclusion, given the firm ness in the July and August data, that Septem ber would have m arked the third m onth in a row of an improving trend.  They would have been tempted to interpret that  as indicating that ac tivity had seen its low point. The data dropped off dra maticall y, of course, in the post-Septem ber 11th reports. If one tried to average together the two sub-samples the results would be nonsense.  Neither p eriod is going to characterize the m onth.  And that’s where we are stuck. We can’t conclude anything about the A ugust to Se ptem ber data per se.  We really have to view this s ituation as a b reak in the s eries and try  to find a new base, a new place to s tart and m aybe s ee a trend form ing.  But that’s going to take a little m ore tim e for any dataset.   Turning to the national econom y, I have  no idea what the national income accounts nu mbers are g oing to add up to for the foreseeable future, either from  the product s ide or from  the incom e side, let alone ho w they will break down for various 10/2/01 62 sectors and regions and so on. But I don’t thi nk that’s really the biggest challenge we have. A number of people have m entioned in one way or another that uncertainty is an issue. Not long ago I thought m ost of the un certainties we had to worry about involved developm ents that m ight occur outside the Un ited States--perhaps involving Argentina or Japan or the launch of the euro  or som ething else.  Those concerns have not gone away entirely but obviously uncertainties within our  country have suddenly jumped to the top of the lis t of things we’re uncertain about.  It may well be th at we will escape som e potential p roblems in the inte rnationa l aren a.  Maybe Argentine will no t default and sp ark a crisis. Maybe Japan has turned a policy co rner; m aybe the m ark-to-m arket of equity portfolios of  their banks star ting yesterday will not cause serious problem s in their banking ind ustry.  Mayb e the launch of  the euro will go well.   Neverthe less, it s eems to me that we’re going to face a protracted peri od of waxing and waning of anxieties, with good justification. I would not a ttach the term  “irrational” to  the anxiety.  I think it is probably very rational. But it’s difficult if not impossible to quantify, and certainly we can’t observe it. The Comm ittee’s p ress statem ent of Septem ber 17th said that w e recogn ized that the actu al federal funds rate m ight be  below its target rate on occasio n in these unusual circum stances.  I was very pleased a bout the inclusion of that wording and I thought it might continue to be needed in our statem ents for som e time.  We’ve had inflation and inflation psychol ogy.  And in those periods we found that it was especially difficult to draw any conclusion from  movements in nom inal m agnitudes, so instead we resorted to paying m ore attention to--if not  targeting outright--qua ntitative m agnitudes.  10/2/01 63 For exactly the opposite reasons relating to  the difficulty of observing inflation psychology, I think in this peri od of heightened anxiety we have to think along the sam e lines. If we don’t go all the wa y to quantity targeting I’d at  least like to think about a proviso clause as to what we’re willing to s ee happen to nominal intere st rates, espec ially the overnight interbank rate. I don’t expect that at this m eeting we’re  going to change the statem ent that accom panies our annou ncem ent.  But the statem ent that the risks are weighted m ainly toward conditions that may generate econom ic weakness has becom e in effect a proviso clause. It says that if we get m ore weak data, the  FOMC m ay cut the overnight  interbank rate som e more.  If the stated funds rate ta rget is not producing an expansion in central bank liquidity, the m onetary base, I would prefer  to think in te rms of our being willing to let the ra te drift lower.  The one thing  that we certainly would not wa nt to see, as I was suggesting earlier in questioning D ino, is a cont raction in the monetary  base.  In fact, not only should growth in the base not be negative , it should be adequate  to assure that w e accomm odate the dem and we believe exists for b ase money.  Thank you.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Dave Stockton got us off to a wonderful start in ad mitting just h ow uncertain w e are.  Now we are at least as uncertain but with an unbe lievable am ount of s pecificity about it!   What do we know about the Second Dist rict?  It was weak going into the tragedy and it is weaker now. One of the results of that is  going to be a stress on the fiscal situation of New York City. Even so, our analys is to date says tha t the City’s f iscal 10/2/01 64 situation will hold up; that will  have som e effect on the fiscal  situation of New York State as well. We think th e Greenboo k forecast is as good a forecast as one could m ake.  And we agree with the autho rs that the do wnside risk is very considerable, especially in coming quarters, and that we don’t know what the longer term is going to look like.  The likelihood is  that the eco nomy will s nap back, as  suggested in the forecas t.   As regards monetary policy, I believe that we are being rewarded for the high degree of confidence in the Fed and the greate r transparen cy we have  achieved in recent years by th e market forecasting what I at least think we clearly should do at th is meeting.  I believe we  would be very ill- advis ed to te st ou r cred ibility by saying th is is what w e’re doing at this m eeting but we’re so certain about  the future that we want to put everyone on notice that we m ay tighten m onetary policy som etime soon.  We don’t know enough to say th at.  And nobody expects us to say it. If we say thing s that tes t our cred ibility in order to sho w our centr al banker v irtues, I th ink we will le ssen our cen tral banke r virtues and certainly lessen our credibility.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  As others have said, in the short run we are facing potentially the st art of a crisis of confidence both among businesses and households, which is likely to  interact with the pre-existing weak macroeconom ic environm ent to lead to a slid e in econom ic activity.  Both the length and the depth of that slide are uncertain but they  could conceivably be longer and deeper than in the baseline forecast. Therefore, o ur challe nge today is to take actions to attem pt to avoid one of the m ore pessim istic consum er confidence scenarios. 10/2/01 65Even before Septem ber 11th indicators of household behavior were som ewhat troubling. Housing activity and particularly single-fam ily st arts, which had been a source of strength, had softened a bit.   Cons umer confidence was al so sliding even before the attacks occurred, and that s lide of confidence has  certa inly continued following indicating further stress for households. With more layoff announcem ents, especially in the airline sector, and the lik ely m ultiplier effects for relate d industries, th ere is am ple reason to b elieve th at last week’s increase in in itial claims is likely to be th e precu rsor to further increases in unemploym ent.  Agains t this set of  inco ming data, the Greenbook’s baseline forecast of unemploym ent reach ing clo se to 6 percent does not s eem out of t he realm  of pos sibility at all.  In the context of such a  rise in une mploym ent, it is un likely that ev en the few retailers that s aw a return  to planned perform ance last week can be complacent that cond itions in the ho usehold sec tor will supp ort a retu rn to a reason able pace of gro wth.   Similarly, indicators on the business sector  were also m ixed and negative even before September 11th. Declines in business fixed inve stment, particularly in the high-tech categories, continued una bated.  Inform al contacts and surveys of banks and other businesses suggest that the un certainty about the consum er response to the attacks is feeding through to uncertainty am ong busine sses as well.  Many banks report a sharp drop-off in dem and for business loans after September 11th, suggesting that sm all businesses in particular are less willing to risk capital on expanding investm ent spending during this period of uncertainty. 10/2/01 66While the auto industry is struggling to create dem and by providing strong incentives, in a survey that straddled the September 11th date, the NAPM reported that manufacturing activity f ell again in Septem ber, m arking the f ourteenth month of a factory slum p.   The conditions leading to a downward traj ectory in the real sector have been reinforced in financial m arkets.  Over $1 tr illion of equity wealth  has been lost since While equity indices have declined 10 to 20 percent over this interm eeting period, fixed incom e markets have no t becom e more accommodative.  As for the question Cathy Minehan raised, I think that at least in th e governm ent sector the bond m arket is driven by concerns about the budget out look, since the T IPS m arket doesn’t seem to indicate any increase in inflation concerns. In the below-investm ent-grade corporate bond sector, concerns about risks seem to be the predom inant factor lead ing long-term rates to rem ain stubbornly h igh.  Additio nally, while large b anks claim  that th ey have not tightened term s and standards on business loans since the attack s, they do admit to watching closely for signs of deterioration. Bankers clearly unders tand that default risk has increased, and they will cer tainly act to protec t their incom e and capital positions as m uch as possible.  Unfortunately, the in ternationa l sector is unlikely to add any strength to the near-term  outlook.  Equity m arkets in alm ost all industrial econom ies have been hit by the sam e reevaluation of business prospects that h as affected o ur equity m arkets.  Similarly, safe haven flows from  the dolla r, the euro, and the pound sterling into the Swiss franc indicate th at market participants  may be rethinking the short-term  prospects for a num ber of econom ies.  10/2/01 67The m ost positiv e deve lopment from the in terna tional sec tor is that o il prices seem  unlikely to spike higher, which is helpful on the inflation front but indicates that the supply and dem and dyna mics in that m arket ar e consistent with a future of slowing growth globally. Against this background, I believe that policy m ust respond.  A num ber of speakers h ave rais ed qu estions a bout the level of  the re al interest rate.  It’s im portant to note that since 1960 there have been six peri ods of slowdown.  During five of those periods, the real interest rate touched zero and during two of those periods it was through th e decis ions th at we m ake today, that w ill no t in any  sense be un preceden ted. The m arkets are certainly expecting a respons e today.  And I think to disappoint them risks setting off a global reacti on that m ight be difficult to co ntrol.  We are, as others have said, benefited by the fact that both in flation and inflation expectations are well contained. It is right to po int out that in the longer run we m ay confront a potential interaction b etween a s timulative m onetary po licy and a stimulative fiscal policy as our monetary policy stim ulus and m ore stim ulus from the fiscal side are both called upon to counter the risk of further slowing in th e econom y.  But even r ecognizing the challenge that m ight em erge from  unpredictable long-te rm policy interactions, I believe that we need to set a priority today on the im mediate m acroeconom ic challenge and the real downside risks confronting us in the near term .  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Kelley.

MR. KELLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  First of all, m y congratulations to the Greenbook staff for a fine job under im possible conditions.  However, as the authors 10/2/01 68 them selves are at pains to point out, this and all other forecasts today can have only a limited cred ibility.  This is evid enced  by the quite appropriately wide spectrum  of the alternative s cenarios, several of which are v irtually as p lausible as the baselin e forecast itself. Yet policy m ust be m ade.  How are we to m eet that necessity ?   I felt earlier and feel today that m onetary policy m ade its m ost im portant contribution to reversing this cycle over the first half of the year , and I’m  proud of what was done by this Comm ittee.  Given what is already in the pipeline, together with the possibility of som ewhat lower rates, policy seems very suppo rtive.  Changes from  here on will likely play a r elatively minor role com pared to deve lopments in f iscal po licy, consum er confidence, and the progress of the war on terrorism.  Monetary policy was, in my opinion, a key positive force earlier, but the fo cus today m ay be to ensure that it does not becom e a negative factor in the ec onom ic equation.  How could that happen? In the short run, this m ay be one of those very strange tim es when appearance could be the m ost im portant real ity.  The Fed is on the recovery team , of c ourse.  But we must be seen to be on that team  by the man on t he street, both on Main Street and Wall Stree t.  To be so perc eived will be a positiv e force for recove ry, whereas to be seen otherwise could be a m ajor negative.  As our nation struggles to recover from  a major traum a, surprising the m arkets could be an a dditional traum a we just do not need right now. This condition will hopefully change soon and the day will likely com e when a policy su rprise will b e appropria te, bu t not to day.  Fortunately, Mr. Chairm an, inf lation is most like ly going to tren d downward over the forecast p eriod, giving th e Comm ittee some further room  to m aneuver and tim e to reverse course in an  orderly manner.   10/2/01 69I believe th e Comm ittee will soon be faci ng two success ive sets of challenges and the soon er the b etter in each c ase.  The first will b e when and how to term inate this easing cy cle when the econom y stabilizes.  We obviously are not to that point yet.  I hope the end of our easing process will be followed shortly by the second challenge, determ ining how and when it will be necessary to begin to damp the enormous a mount of stimulation that has been  and will be pum ped into this economy first by monetary po licy and soon by fiscal policy .  I believe the Comm ittee m ay be entitled to tak e som e satisf action in the ro le po licy has play ed in recent years,  but the future will probably prove to be at least equally as challenging as the past.  What is needed today, however, seem s pretty straightforward.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I found the alternative sim ulations provided by the staff in the latest Greenbook to be especially useful.  Given the exceptional degree of uncertainty that we now face, the a lternative scena rios he lp us to better appreciate the range of outcom es.  But in addition, they allowed me to easily craft my own forecast by add ing the altern ative scenar ios directly to the ba selin e subject to my personal assessm ent of the probabilities associat ed with each.  When I began this exercise I thought that it would allow m e to presen t to you an interes ting, even compelling, alternative to the Greenbook for ecast.  To m y surprise--and I m ust say disappointm ent--I found that when I com pleted this exercise, th e alternative scenarios turned out to be remarkably offsetting.  That left m e, no doubt, with the same uncertainty as the staff had, and equally likely to be wrong, but with a fore cast that turned out  to be rem arkably similar to th e baseline.  While we face enorm ous uncertainty as I ind icated, I think this 10/2/01 70 sort of experience add s a little to the credib ility o f the baselin e.  I did won der a bit if  the staff m ight have been playing som e gam es by offe ring us a series of al ternative s that they knew were entir ely of fsetting just to reinf orce the baseline.  But David Stockton assured me that this was an accid ent of good fortune rath er than a strategy!   I find that it’s useful in my own thi nking to sep arate the f orecast hor izon into two sub-periods. The near term  covers the next two or three quarters and the rem ainder is the period through 2003. It seem s to m e that there are two key dr ivers of the near-term forecast. The first is the mom entum in the econo my prior to Septem ber 11th. The second is the effect of the events  of Septem ber 11th through disruptions to  key industries and via consum er and business sentim ent.  With respect to the m omentum , som e saw the data immediately preced ing Septem ber 11th as very encouraging a nd signaling that the econom y was poised for a rebound.  Others interp reted the very sam e data as indicating that the econ omy had at most stabilized at a growth rate not m uch different from  zero, and they we re still rev ising down their forecasts.   I think there was am ple scope in the da ta to support both of these differing interpretations, but I was  in the latter cam p.  And the m ore pessim istic in terpretation suggested that additional easing would have been justified in the absence of the events of alternative s imulation with eas ier m oney policy.   But the events of September 11th clearly called for a dow nward revision to the near-term  forecas t--at least to the es timate of the third qu arter and the forecast for th e fourth quarter and likely  into early 2 002.  Because a downward im petus to a considerable degree reflects an assessm ent of the psychol ogical effects of the events of Septem ber 10/2/01 71 11th, the uncertainty about the forecast is an order of m agnitude above norm al.  But my judgm ent is that over this tim e frame the risk s are m ore likely asymm etric toward still weaker growth. So I give som e considerable weight, 50 to 75 percen t, to the altern ative simulation of a collapse in consum er and bus iness confidence.  Having said that, the downside risk seem s to be m ost acute in the fourth quarter because I’m also going to give very high w eight to the alternative sim ulation of major fiscal stim ulus.  And by the first quarter, that also begins to weigh in importantly.  There is little that m onetary policy c an do throug h trad itional channels to spur demand ove r this tim e fram e.  Howe ver, th ere m ight be and probably would be som e salutary effect by bolstering confidence in the future.  What we do and what we say should be designed to contribute  to this end, and I think Gove rnor Kelley m ade that point extrem ely well.   A second consideration concerns the im plications for m onetary policy of the evolution of overall financia l conditions.  Once again, we’r e confronted by a shock that has had direct effects both on financial condi tions, specifically on equity prices, and on aggregate dem and above and beyond the effect on  equity prices.  Monetary policy has to move aggressively enough to counter at least the adverse effects on overall financial conditions b efore it can hope to m ake a net co ntribution to offsetting the direct effect on aggregate dem and. Over the rem ainder of the forecast h orizon it seem s to m e that the fis cal assum ptions begin to do minate the forecas t, complem ented by the details of the intern al dynam ics of recovery as consum er sentim ent and hopefully equity prices rebound.  In addition, the latter developm ent should be rein forced by the delayed contributions of the 10/2/01 72 forces we expected to support recovery  before the events of Septem ber 11th, including a rebound in high-tech investm ent after a sharp and prolonged retrenchm ent and a return to inventory accum ulation after li quidation runs its course.   Now, beyond the nearer-term  period it seem s to m e that the r isks tu rn to the upside, at least after m id-2002 and especially into 2003.  My reading is that the fiscal stimulus will be an order of m agnitude a bove that in the Greenbook baseline, som ething closer to the m ajor fiscal stim ulus simulation.  Over this tim e frame, therefore, perhaps the key question is what moneta ry po licy is a goo d fit with th e assum ed fiscal stim ulus.  There is a p otential that an earlier an d more aggressive reve rsal of recen t and prospective monetary ea sing will ultim ately be called f or than may be contem plated at this poin t.  Still, there’s am ple scope for additional m onetary policy easing over the near term .  In part this reflects the fact that, g iven the pros pects of a rise in the unem ploym ent rate to the 6 percent range, we should now be targeting a period of  above trend growth.  So, whereas before we m ight have thought that we needed stim ulus to get econom ic growth back to trend as quickly as possible, now if  we e nded up with som ething that was less than a percentage point above trend I thi nk we’d be disappointe d.  We could probably tolerate something even stronger than that fo r awhile.  Nevertheless, as a num ber have already sugg ested, m onetary policy will face the c halleng e at s ome point d uring th e second period and beyond of a tim ely return toward neutrality. I think the o ther issue r elating to the st rategy of monetary po licy rela tes to the timing of any cum ulative decline in the funds rate.  Most of the bad m acroeconom ic news in par ticular rela tes to higher unem ploym ent th at lies ahead and likely will extend at least through the m iddle of ne xt year.  In evalua ting what we do today, we should pay some 10/2/01 73 atten tion to how much more of  a cumulative decline m ight be  justified given the forecast we now hold. And then we need to consider  how we should spread the change out over time so that we don’t end up doing more than we would prefer to do.  In addition, we might worry a bit about how we should signal ma rkets about our future intentions so that we don’t face m arket pressure again to m ove further than would be prudent.  I must say, however, that I don’t think that is really a story of today, but  a story of what we do at subsequent m eetings.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  We’ve often spoken about the value of confidence in econom ic relationships.  Confidence is a variable th at is a direct term in no econom ic equation but is a key f actor in alm ost all of them --consum ption, investm ent, em ploym ent, stock m arkets, risk discounts, foreign tradi ng, capital flows, and on down the list. The macroeconom ic im plicat ions of a serious lo ss of confidence could be enorm ous.  So what is the evidence?   It has o nly been th ree weeks sin ce the attack s and already there is a great deal of evid ence that confidence is eroding.  If you hadn’t called a break, I was going to go through this lis t really qu ickly.  I will still go throug h it quickly bu t a little less so now.  [Laughter ]  One piece of evidence is trav el dem and, which is definitely down. Another is c onsum er confidence and Dave Stockton talked about that. Layoffs have risen. We see eviden ce in financial variab les--the stock m arket, risk sp reads on lesser-rated bonds, early sign s of implied cred it market volatility.  There’s some evidence that even housing dem and and auto sales m ay be down in the period since 10/2/01 74There are tw o indicators on which I’m not  quite sure about the tim ing.  One, which Karen Johnson spoke about already, is the fo reign sector.  It’s a little hard to tell what occurred before and after September 11th, but it’s clear that the n ews there isn’t good. Another is commodity prices, which have dropped sharply.  I’ve often spoken about those before as a precursor  of inflation.  The staff has been persuading m e that they sharply. A last issue is the fore casts of others.  The NABE took a survey of their forecasters s ince th e event.  Eighteen  out of 21 of them  had a significan tly more pessim istic outlook.  I’m not sure that they know any m ore than our forecasters, bu t all forecasters seem  to be m oving in one direction.   This all sets up what I see as a difficu lt policy problem .  The attacks could be a major de mand shock or a m inor one, for a long period or a short period.  Just how do we respond?   On the fiscal side I think there are at least two things that  fiscal policy should do. There s hould be ex penditu res for m ilitary and other security m easures and compensation for the direct victim s.  Whet her fiscal policy ought  to do anything beyond that, I find a difficult question. But if m ore stimulus is required, I’d like to see it provided in a way that does n’t dissipate the long-term  budget surplus, national saving, and the low long-term  interest rates that have been a hallm ark of the recen t period. On the m onetary side, I also see the n eed for action.  Monetary policy can be changed quickly. It can be used flexibly a nd it can be reversed just as quickly should circum stances change.  As a num ber of you ha ve said, this latter property is very important right now, given the m assive uncertain ty.  The combination of short-term  fiscal 10/2/01 75 easing and monetary easing I think is our best hope for keeping the economy as strong as possible in both the short r un and the long run.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you.  Let’s m ove on to Don Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  As noted in theComm ittee’ s announcem ent of two weeks ago, the terrorist attacks subjected an already weak econom y to a further downward shock.  Just before Septem ber 11th aggregate dem and apparently was still being im peded by an ongoing downdraft in investm ent, as firm s corrected a previous ov er-exp ansion of capital equipm ent, and the resulting decline in em ploym ent and equity p rices threa tened to sap consum er spending.  As noted in  the Greenbook, firm  evidence that the downdraft was beginning to abate had not em erged and the econom ic forecast probably would again have been m arked down and the anticipated strengthening pushed further into the future. The attacks them selves d isrupted busin ess trans action s for a tim e and apparently have heightened con cerns about the future, likely restraining spending even m ore and further delaying the resumption of solid growth. A significant easing of financ ial conditions would seem  to be called for to counter the effect s of the unexpected weakness in demand from these various sources.  While such an easing m ight have little ef fect on the nea r-term performance of the econom y, it would appropriately give added im petus to  an eventua l return to f ull resource utilization. When the econo my ultim ately streng thens, it seem s inevitable th at it will r esume growth f rom a base of  anappreciably lower level of resource utilization than today or than you might have expected at your August m eeting.     Yet financial conditions have not eased appreciably since late risk and weaker spending prospects apparen tly has offset the effects of the 50 basis poin ts of easing you p ut in place two weeks ago and the further federal funds rate re ductions now built in to financial percent since the Augus t FOMC m eeting and risk spreads have widened for all but the highest-rated  businesses.  Indeed, bond rates for m any businesses are unchanged or  even up considerably.  In addition, the average value of the dollar on foreign exchange m arkets has appreciated slightly. With markets strong ly anticipating a furt her decrease in your federal funds rate target at th is meeting, holding policy unchanged 10/2/01 76 likely would tighten financial condi tions substantially.  Thus, the question facing you today would seem  to be not whether to ease further, but by how m uch.  Market observers believe that your debate will be between 25 and 5 0 basis poin t reductions in the funds rate.  The choice between these two would seem  to depend not only on the most likely outcom e for the econom y under the two alternatives, but the risks around that m odal outcom e and the costs of m issing to one side or the other. The choice of a 25 basis point  easing would be justified by concern that a larg er action at th is time could lead to policy becom ing so accomm odative ov er com ing m onths that the rebound in d emand beginning next year would be sh arp enough to add to inflation pressures before a policy reversal could contain them  effectively.  A major uncertainty in the outlook is th e stance of fiscal policy.  Unless signs surface very quickly that n ear-term  economic distress is abating, a process of political comprom ise by inclusion could well produce a substantially m ore expansive polic y than is built into the s taff forecast. When the resulting stim ulus will hit th e econom y depends, of course, on the nature of the pr ogram s that are enacted.  As next year goes on, however, aggregat e dem and could well be boosted by the effects of expansionary fiscal and monetary p olicies ju st as the internal dynam ics of strengthening private dem and take hold following the working down of inventory and investm ent goods overhangs. Private demand also m ay be subj ect to upside as well as to th e numerous downside risks.  One possi bility is that a good part of the cutback in s pending in the las t few weeks will turn out to b e trans itory.  As the natur e of the cou ntermeasure s agains t terrorism becom es clearer and m ore focused, as som e successes are reg istered and secur ity in the a ir and else wher e is im proved, uncertainty will narrow and som e of the initial f ears and percep tions of  risk will interactions and decisions. The rise  in equity prices and decline in risk prem iums over the last week m ay already have reflected som e move ment in this direction.  Should activity rebound fairly strongly next year, upward pressures on wages and prices are likely to em erge at considerably lower levels of re source utilization than in the second half of the 1990s. The slower growth  of structural productivity that seem s to be in train would tend to  boost unit labor costs at a tim e when profit m argins have already been squeezed.   Slimm er margins provide con siderab le inducem ent fo r businesses to pass labor costs through in to prices and are likely to  mute the co mpetitiv e forces th at make such a pass-through difficult, especia lly if , at the sam e time, 10/2/01 77 higher real interest rates induced by expansive fiscal policy militate agains t cost-saving cap ital deepen ing. Although markets would be som ewhat disappointed by a 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate target, the backup in other interest rates  and the dec line in eq uity prices lik ely would be lim ited by a sense that the FOM C was sim ply waiting f or more def initive evidence of the dim ensions of the response of dem and to the attacks and was prepared to ease further, even within the interm eeting period, should the em erging inform ation warrant.  The total am ount of additional ease built into the structur e of m arket inte rest rate s---now between 75 and 100 basis points--pro bably would be trimm ed only a little. You m ay see these expectatio ns as a reaso nable ass essment of the am ount of ease needed to prom ote a satisfactory strengthening of the econom y in 2002 and 2003.  You may also see the resulting expectations as representing a hi ghly likely policy outcom e as well after a 25 basis point reduction at this m eeting, given the possibility of further Comm ittee actions as employm ent and production decline over the next several m onths.  But given the shocks to the econom y and the absence of any apparent easing in financial condit ions noted at the beginning of m y discuss ion, the Comm ittee m ay prefer a more aggressiv e policy action and want to lower the federal funds  rate by 50 basis points at this meeting. The potential f or inflat ion pressures to mount as the econom y rebounds m ust be weighe d against the likelihood of a prolonged period of weakness that opens up a sizable output gap. Indeed, th e baseline forecast in the Greenbook describ es the latter outcom e.  While that f orecas t assu mes 50 basis points of easing over the fourth q uarter, its assessm ent of likely dem and and resource pressures would seem  to suggest th at an imm ediate reduction in the federal funds rate of 50 basis point s would run minim al risk of higher inflation emerging before counter vailing policy action had a chance to be felt. And, as shown in an alternative Greenbook sim ulation, stronger fiscal stim ulus does not m aterially deflect the econom y from the disinflationary track of  the baseline projection.   If the headw inds facing the econom y for a tim e are on the order of magnitude of those em bodied in the staff forecast, a federal funds rate that is 50 basis poin ts lower would not be all that accomm odative.  In real term s, such a ra te would st ill be positiv e by m any measures and above its level in previous periods  of econom ic weakness--for exam ple the early 1990s. With lim ited net financia l stim ulus in th e pipeline even under this easier alternative, recovery im portantly depends on the resiliency of the private econom y as excesses are worked down and underly ing investm ent incentiv es rem ain in place, with an ex tra push 10/2/01 78 from  fiscal policy.  Easier m oneta ry policy itse lf can’t add ress the underlying uncertainties and overh angs weighing on dem and, but it can help to buoy asset prices and lower the cost of credit at least a little relative to a sm aller easing m ove.   Moreover, in an uncertain envi ronment, the larg er action avoids the poten tial for especially advers e effects on con fidence and risk-taking were the Comm ittee seen to b e less agg ressive th an anticipated. For this and other r easons, you m ay judge the probability that insufficiently accommodative policy would accentuate a process of progressive econom ic weakening th at would be difficult to reverse as appreciab ly larger in the curren t circum stances  than the p robability that too stimulative a policy would intensify inflation pressures.   Saving policy “ammunition” for late r could create a situ ation in which m uch m ore easing is requ ired before long to counter cumulating weakness.  Of course, anticipatory and aggressive policy can lead to overshooting, but, by he ading off wor sening situations, it also is lik ely to requ ire smaller tota l action than does policy that moves m ore gradually. more easing going forward should you lower the f unds rate by 50 basis points at this m eeting, given the high odds they have already put on this action. And their expectations  of such a sizable m ove at this meeting have not led them to an ticipate a num ber of further such to 50 basis points of rate reductions  by early next year followed by a subsequent rise in rate s.  Financia l market p articipants ev idently believe that you can ease aggressively  and then stop and reverse in a timely fashion.  Judging  from  the decline in TIP S spreads in recen t weeks, the stickiness of long-term rates has been a response to m ore expansive fiscal policy rather than  a reflection of rising inflation expectations as the path of the funds rate has been m arked down.  Although a cut in the federal funds  rate target at this m eeting would bring the cum ulative change in this rate to 100 or 125 basis points since late August, you m ay we ll see the risks to your objectives in the f oreseeable f uture as sti ll tilted  toward eco nomic weakness.  Econom ic activity is almost certain to  be quite soft in the near term , and the Comm ittee would probably wa nt eviden ce on the lik ely extent of the cutback in private dem and and the im petus from  fiscal policy before it could judge that this w eakness was likely to be balanced by a strong rebound a few quarters hence.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Questions  for Don?  President Parry.  10/2/01 79

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Don, I’d like to ask you and Dave a question about the chart and table in the Bluebook on Chart 4 followi ng page 10.  We’ve talked a bit about the equilibrium  real rate as a way to m easure the current stance of policy.  If one believes that the equilib rium  real ra te is w ithin the  range of  the shaded areas, the range has gotten so large that it leads one to believe, based on th e Treasury inflation-ind exed securities, th at our policy is incredibly expansive. On the other hand, if one looks at some of the lower estim ates, p articularly the one based on historic al data and the staff forecast, it appears as if we’re providing an anem ic amount of stim ulus.  I was thinking that perhaps you have some feelings or views about what rate within this histor ically wide range it m ight be reasonable for us to focus on. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think the range is p articul arly wid e because th e staff forecast is dragging do wn the lower end of  that range.  The calcu lated e quilib rium  rates that ten ded to bring the range down are th e ones that include the staff estim ates of  the restrain ing effects of both the pre-Septem ber 11th and post-Septem ber 11th shocks to dem and.  If you think th e staff forecast is a reason able estim ate of where the econom y will go--or at least a reason able m ode of that es timate--then som ething toward the lower end of that range probably is where you would think the rate is.  Also, having the third-quarte r inflation- indexed security at a 3.8  percen t real rate do esn’t reflect the most recen t declin es in that rate. That rate has declined som e over the third quarter and I don’t know what the forward rate derived from that would look lik e if we did it today.  My guess is that it would be at least a num ber of tenths lower than sh own in this chart.  The TIPS rate reflects people’s expectations about fiscal policy.  That’s a rate derived from  going out on the yield curve, so it em bodies th e effects of the more expansionary fiscal policy as that  10/2/01 80 policy kicks in later next year and in future years.  The elevated le vel is a reflection of that steep upward slope of the yield curve,  partly supply induced  and partly I think macroeconom ically induced in the sense of  the effects of fiscal policy over com ing quarters. But probably som ewhere out late r next year and in following years the calculation would have interest  rates being pushed up as a reflection of th e expected turnaround in monetary policy. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. So you think the degree of monetary ease is, pick one:  huge, moderate, or m eager? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think rig ht now it’s mode rate an d I--well, I won’t give a  policy recomm endation!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. May I m ake a suggestion?  Why don’t you have Dave Stockton talk to you about this.  He’s got it down pat. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. It’s a little eas ier for m e to answer this qu estion b ecause in some sense I would look at the line on Chart 4 labeled “FRB/US m odel, based on historical data and th e staff forecast” as so mething that would  approxim ate our best g uess as to what th e equilibr ium rate  is.  Therefore, I’d have to  say monetary policy provides a small to m oderate am ount of stim ulus.  I would hate to depress you further about this analys is, ho wever, by pointing ou t that each on e of these estim ates has a significan t confidence interval! The bottom  edge of that shaded area is not th e full confidence range that one could have. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I knew you wouldn’t disappoint m e!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I’m going to stop right there. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Thank you. 10/2/01 81 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  Actually, I was goi ng to ask about what you just discussed, so I withdraw  the question in  the inte rest of moving things along. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I wanted to follow up on th at discussion of the equilibrium real rate b ecause I think m any of us have com e to believe that inform ation on this--if we had confidence in it--is very valuable to our setti ng of policy.  I applaud the research that the staff has been doing on this subj ect; I think it already has pr ovided a lot of insights and has been very useful. I have to say, howeve r, that I have a high degree of skepticism about the amount of short-term  variation in the staff measure of  the equilibrium  real rate.  I think that at this point our m ethodology hasn’t  really allowed us to separate out very effectively cyclical from  longe r-term  influences.  So I thi nk the issue needs som e more thought. For one, the p ath of the equ ilibrium  real rate h as so much sensitivity to n ear-term data th at I think an y estim ate th at is no t based upon a forecast that g oes out at least five years fo r exam ple--and return s to som e sense of nor mality--has to be d iscounted consider ably.  But I think  that’s work f or the f uture. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Anybody else?  In keeping with the way Dave Stockton started off this discus sion, I’ll continue.  I think the wide range of uncertainties regarding what has happened and what is a bout to happen has been fully explored here and I believ e very effectively so.  We learn a lot about the un certainties that we face just by listening to those who  are invo lved in ev aluating recen t developm ents--for exam ple, what the individual presidents have said about what is going on in their D istricts.  And I think th e degree of hum ility that  the rest of us have expres sed about our understand ing is 10/2/01 82 a measure of the fact th at we are indeed deal ing with a s ituation that is extr aordina rily uncertain. The one area that has not been m entioned, which I believe requires a bit of discussion, is the very dram atic decline that we  have had in equity asset prices.  We are talking abou t losse s in th e last week or so of  more than a trillion do llars in the valu e of stock m arket holdings.  What we know about this sort of  phenom enon is that it has a really significant im pact.  While it m ay be difficult to m ake a judgm ent as to the magnitude of that im pact, we do have to have  som e sense of what the appropriate value of stocks ought to be or what  equity prem iums ought to be  in the context of what we perceive to be the long -term  equilibrium  real federal funds rate.  The work that has been done around  here sugges ts, adjus ted with all due  hum ility, that the equ ity m arket is still slightly above where it ought to be. That is not an im portant issue in and of itself, but what is im portant is history.  History sugge sts that m arkets do not go from over-valuation to norm al valuation and stay there.  It suggest s that m arkets almost invariably over-adjust in the opposite direction. That in turn sugge sts to m e that the no tion that som ehow we are beyond any further deflation fr om the asset side is at leas t open to serious question.  I don’t pretend to say that the ad justm ent process needs to occu r very quickly.  Indeed, one scenario could involve a very large adjustm ent in equity prices, a couple of years of hiatus, and then another adjustm ent.  Clearly, that is not a no ncredible scenario.  We have seen it in the past. All I want to  indica te he re is th at the risks clearly are on the downside.  And without getting into m ore discussion on the issu e, I would m erely say that what we ought to do--as I think m ost of the people around this  table already have s uggested--is to ease  10/2/01 83 by 50 basis points and retain the statem ent indicating that th e risks are tilted toward econom ic weakness.  The pluses and the m inuses have been fully explored, and I think that would be the appropriate pol icy at this point.  Vice Chair.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. I support your recomm enda tion.  I would m ake just a couple of quick comments that relate to the chart we were talking about a m inute ago.  One way I looked at that was to ask the question: Going forward, which m istake do we m ost want to avoid?   Given the fragility and the psychol ogy of the m arket, I think we most want to avoid not appearing to be willing to take th is action.  So what you propose is exactly what I want. Second, I would like to say d itto to what the Vice Chairm an said earlier.  I expect--and m aybe hope --that we will have to reverse this easing m ove.

MS. MINEHAN. I sup port your recommendation, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. I support the 50 basis point reduction in the target rate today.  But for the period between now and the next  meeting, I think the statem ent that was included in our announcem ent of the  17th is probably going to be needed again. As the Presiden t said, the te rrorists de cided when and how this started.  The United States and its allies will decide when and how it ends. We don’t know when that’s going to be.  If there is another occasion of greatly heightened anxiety, I w ould hope that the Desk would again be willing to let th e funds rate trade as low as necessary  to provid e adequate liquidity. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  The m arket will assume that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Yes, I agree w ith the Vice Ch air. Indeed, one of the things we haven’t discussed relates to the implica tions of another episode.  My impression is that in suc h an event w e will do wh at we’ve do ne in the p ast.  We would issue an FO MC statem ent at that tim e indi cating in effect what  you’re suggesting.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Poole. 10/2/01 85

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I support your recomm endation, but I would like to add a co mment.  We’ve talked a lot abou t business and consum er confidence, an d I think th e state of confidence is  not independent of our own visibility.  Let m e emphasize that po int by  assum ing som ething co ntrary to  fact becaus e I think it will m ake the point clear. Suppose all of us w ho are commonly out on the road f rom time to tim e giving speeches an d talk ing to the press were to with draw from  that activ ity?  I think that would send a very bad m essage to the m arkets.  It would say that we’re terr ified to fly and th at we’re terrified to talk because we m ight say something that would upset the m arkets.  I think it’s important that  we be visible.  We should work to resum e a sense of nor mality.  And the m essage that we all agree on around the table is the one that we should be stating publicly: The econom y has excellent long-run prospects; our econom y and society have strong fundam entals to deal with the short- run uncertainties, but there is no way to forecast what that short run is going to look like and, therefore, we’re not g oing to offer such a forecast. For us to hunker down and disappear because we’re afraid of saying something that m ight be wrong or misinterpr eted is only going to  tend to erode public confidence. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. No, I thi nk hunkering down was the appropriate thing to do right after the shock. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Right, but we’re now  three weeks beyond that shock. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, I agre e with you.  There’s certainly no need for us to change our norm al practices.  I do think our degree of uncertainty is higher, but that’s the nature of the gam e.   10/2/01 86

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Well, I just wanted to make  that point clear because I feel very strongly that we must not disappear. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, I agree with that. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Mr. Chairman, could I add a comment to that? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. It isn’t always necessary to be speaking to the press in order to be seen as  visible with in the Dis trict.  I’ve don e more outreach than usu al since feel comfortable, though I know the range of uncertainty is wide, that because of that activ ity I ha ve som e feel of what is going on--m uch m ore so than if I had m ade a dozen speeches. That’s becaus e these interaction s give us m ore inform ation and they invo lve less effort and worry than speaking to the pres s, with all the prepar ation that goes into that. So I think it’s som ething that we all ought to think about carefully as we balance how to spend our tim e.

To further its long-run objectives, the Comm ittee in th e imm ediate fu ture seeks con ditions in reserve m arkets consistent w ith reducing the federal funds ra te to an average of around 2-1/2 percent.”  For the balance of risk s statem ent in the press statem ent:  “Against the background of its long-run go als of price s tability and sustain able econom ic growth, and of the inform ation curren tly av ailab le, the Comm ittee believ es that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward cond itions that may generate econom ic weakness in the foreseeab le future.”
