MR. KOS. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. I will be referring to the charts that were handed out this m orning.  1/ The top panel of the first page depicts U.S. and euro-area cash and forward rates. U.S. 3- month cash rates,  the solid red line, declined about 1/4 percent since the last m eeting, whil e 3-m onth and 9-m onth for ward rates expectations that policy rate s would continue to be reduced.  In the euro area, cash rates fell about 12 basis points but 9- month forward rates fell by m ore than 1/4 percentage point, widening the spread  between cash and forward rates.  The rate m ovements reflected reactions to weak data for the euro area as well as heightened expectations th at the total am ount of e asing to come from  the ECB would be larger than had been previously anticipated. This m orning’s two-week refi nancing operation by the ECB was under-subscribed by about 25 billion euros and the operation actually drained 23 billion euros, as banks expecting to be  able to bu y cheaper  funds after this Thursday’s ECB m eeting did not have  much de mand for 2-week m oney.  Overnight rates m oved to about 4 per cent after the operati on’s results were announced.   The bottom panel provides three snapshots of the Japanese yield curve in 2001--for February 28th, August 14th, and Nove mber 2nd. Broadly speaking, the curve continues to  exhibit a very flat trajectory out to three years and then steepens for maturities beyond th at out to 30 years.  Rates at the very long end have stayed near 2.5 percent, reflecting both a prem ium for the longer maturity and the lesser m arket liquidity  of bonds beyond 10 years.  But the long rates perhaps also reflect worries abou t the prospect of significant governm ent debt issu ance, which m ay be necessary to finance a cleanup o f the bankin gsector. 1/ Charts used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript. 11/6/01 2 Staying with the Japanese markets for a bit on page two, the top panel shows the 5-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield and the 5-year yen swap rate since January 2000. The middl e panel depicts the 10-year JGB and swap rates for the same period.  In bot h, the spread between the swap rate and the JGB yield trended near 25 basis points  in early 2000, then began to narrow in late 2000 and early 2001 as yields starte d to fall and rates at the short end approached zero. By the summer, the 10-ye ar differential went to zero and was even negative on some days.  The 5-year differential narrowed a bit later and is now also near zero. So bank obligations in a country with known banking problems are being priced as substitutes for government credit.  One interpretation would suggest that the market is alrea dy presuming that Japanese bank risk is sovereign ris k.  Another explanation can be found by looking at the flows that are creating this  relationship.  Japanese banks have been very large buyers of 5- and 10-year swaps. That is, they are receiving a long-term fixed rate and paying a short-term floating rate, which lately has been near zero.  That is functionally similar to buying a JGB a nd financing it in the short-term repo investment banks.  Japanese banks have added to their swap positions rather than purchasing more JGBs because of a preferential accounting treatment. With small probabilities that shor t rates will move higher any time soon, the situation probably does not pose near-term concerns.  But Japanese banks do have a stake in spreads staying tig ht and, given that the banks are also large holders of JGBs, in rates remaining low.  Ergo, one quickly gets into the circular logic of the situation. The po ssible need to clean up bank balance sheets turn will raise yields and inflict losses on banks holding large JGB positions and large swap positions as well. As for the markets’ views on the st ate of Japanese banks, the bottom panel graphs the Tokyo stock exchange co mposite index and the bank sub-index.  Both are down substantially since Janua ry of 2000.  Interestingly, the bank sub-index has had its greatest underperformance in the last 12 months, precisely during the time that swap spreads began to narrow. As we go through the next three pag es of charts, I will b riefly review a number of asset pr ice relationsh ips in  major m arkets in the e ight weeks sin ce against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss franc since August 1st.  Despite the  weak data on the U.S. economy, the dollar is ba ck to levels where it traded in m id-yen and the euro. It is s till som ewhat lo wer ag ainst the Swis s franc.  The middle panel graphs im plied volatilities, which have continued to com e down to around 10 percent, com pared to 12 percent in mid-August and 14 percent in m id-11/6/01 3 Another vantage point into the s eeming tranquility of the foreign exchange market is through risk reversals.  This is an options  trade that reflects whether market participants are willing to pay an added premium for protection against the risk of a rising dollar, in which case dollar calls are expensive relative to dollar puts. Alternatively, in the case of  trying to protect against the risk of a falling dollar, dollar puts are favored. Imm ediately after September11th the marketplace bid up dollar puts, but since then this indicator--quite unus ually--has moved to absolute neutrality for all three major currency pairs.  The optim istic view is that market participants believe that exchange rates have achieved something of a sustainable equilibrium.  Probably the more plausible explanation is that there is a lack of conviction among traders about the likely course of exchange rates.  That hypothesis is also supported by anecdotal  evidence in that there has been a pulling back of risk-taking in the foreign exchange market. On page four, the top panel depi cts a num ber of the m ajor global equity indices since August 1st, but re-indexed to th eir closing levels on back to pre-attack levels. The middle panel graphs selected major emerging market indices.  With the exception of the Argentine Merv al index, most have recovered but not as much as the indices of developed c ountry markets.  There appears to have been more discrimination among emerging markets and between emerging and developed markets.  Unlike the calm prevai ling in the forei gn exchange markets and despite the recovery of stock prices, implied volatility--at least as measured by the VIX in the bottom panel--has gone sideways at between 30 and 35 percent since the last meeting, but it is still somewhat elevat ed relative to historical patterns. As shown on page five, spread rela tionships in fixed-income markets tell a similar story.  Spreads continued to  widen on higher risk assets, such as debt of emerging markets, as seen in th e top panel.  The high-yield spread has stayed relatively flat since the last mee ting, but it has also remained at elevated levels despite the rally in equity market s.  In contrast, spreads have actually narrowed for better quality obligations , such as agencies and swaps.  Interestingly, the rising ti de did not lift all boats in the investment-grade corporate sector. The spread in A2 cor porate issues widened slightly.  But even there, one needs to consider that absolute  yields for A2 paper declined modestly.  Moreover, the market absorbed a massi ve amount of supply, including that coming from several issuers who were refinancing maturing commercial paper and willing to pay the premium spread in order to get the deals done.  Finally, at the short end, the implied volatility on near-term Eurodollar contracts has again been rising recently, pointing to some lingering uncertainty at the short end. 11/6/01 4 Turning back to the government yield curve, the top panel of page six depicts the benchmark on-the-run issues in  yield terms along w ith the target fed funds rate since August 1st. Until the middle of last week the pattern of recent months persisted, with gradually falling yields--especially at the short end--and thereby a steepening of the yield curve.   The Treasury’s refunding announcement last Wednesday, which included plans to  revise the buyback program and to suspend issuance of the 30-year bond, surprised the market in its timing and for that matter also surprised the Treasury in the extent of the market reaction. Yields fell sharply on Wednesday and Thur sday as traders rushed to close out short positions in their tr ades, whereby they had been long the 2-year note or similar duration paper and short the 30-y ear bond.  By this morning the long bond yield was at 4.86 percent or almost 40 basis points lower than the closing yield on the day before th e Treasury’s announcement. The bottom  panel depicts yield curv es for A2 industrial corporate bonds, Fannie Maes, swaps, and Treasuries as of Septem ber 10th and as of spilled over to the o ther curves  as well.  Since Septem ber 10th, inte rest rates are generally lower and yield curves are steeper. Moving to the commercial paper market, the theme there is that the year-end has come early to that market. The top left panel graphs the spread between 30-day A1/P1-rated paper and A2/P2 around year-end for three recent years. The 1997-98 period, in blue, wa s typical of many years until very recently.  The black line depicts last yea r’s sharply widening spread and the red line represents the current spread.  The top right panel shows the same  set of relationships for 90-day paper. The trends are similar, though la st year’s widening began later and the size of the widening probably was infl uenced by the suddenness with which the California utilities had difficulty rolli ng over their commercial paper.  This year’s widening began soon after the events of September 11th. The downgrading of several co rporations has reportedly made some managers unwilling to hold A2/P2 paper at yea r-end for window-dressing reasons, but many other fund managers have become unwilling to hold any A2/P2 paper under any circumstances.  The wider spreads have been necessary to draw in new buyers, such as European institutions, to pick up the slack.  Still, the A2/P2 sector has contracted by nearly 50 per cent this year in terms of the amount outstanding. The bottom panel shows the spread  of 90-day A1/P1 commercial paper to 3-month Treasury bills on the left and A2/P2 paper relative to 3-month Treasury bills on the right. These two gr aphs indicate that the widening of the A2/P2 spread, at least so far, is strict ly a matter of deterioration in the A2/P2 sector. Of note is how well the A1/P1 sect or is holding up, with issuers able to sell paper at a cost of only 10 basis po ints or so more than Treasuries. 11/6/01 5 Finally, the last page depicts the relationship between the rate for general collateral (GC) in the repo m arket, the so -called “sp ecials rate” for on-the-run secu rities, and th e incid ence of fa ils to deliver.  The top panel graphs the GC rate in blue and the 5- year sp ecials rate --that is, the rate to finance th e on-the-run 5-year security--in  green.  The gray bars at  the bo ttom repres ent th e volum e of fa ils reported by prim ary dealers for that secu rity.  The inte rest rates are a ll daily, while the v olume of fails is co llecte d weekly; th e num ber represents the volum e of fails on the reporting date.   The bottom  panel has the sam e set of infor mation for the 10-year note.  The specials  rate can be volatile fro m day to day, as dealer financing needs change. The upper boundary is  the GC rate, which roughly tends to track the fed funds rate. The lower boundary is zero. When a security is very scarce, the cost of financing that security can fall to or near zero.  But if deal ers who are sh ort th e issue canno t borrow the paper, a f ail will result.  More cynica lly, a de aler can go short the issue and not deliver, knowing that with the specials ra te so low there is almost no financial penalty to the fail.   While the f ail situa tion in the af termath of  Septe mber 11th garnered a lot of attention and was extraordinary in  its size, securities at tim es do go on special for extended periods of tim e, so a spike in  the volum e of fails is no t thatunusual. For exam ple, as seen in the bottom  panel, in May of 2001 the scarcity of the 10-year issue led to a surge of fails until the May refunding was completed.   I want to m ake two points here.  First, as short-term rates have com edown, the GC rate has com e down a s well.  Second, the am ount of elbowroomfor the specials m arket to m ove around ha s decreased.  The rate doesn’t have to move very far from  the GC rate to get to zero an d create a s ituation that can lead to a rise in f ails.  Thus, even without  future incidents of the kind seen on instan ces where fails accum ulate, at leas t for short periods o f time.   Mr. Chairm an, there were no foreign exchange operations in the interm eeting period.  The tem porary swap  facilities with the E CB and the Bank of England both expired without being re newed in m id-October, and the am ount of the swap f acility with the Bank of Canada reverted to its norm al size.   I will n eed a vote to ratify dom estic operations, and I’d be happy to take any questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Will the em ergence of  fails in the order of  magnitude we’ve been seeing lately im pair the m arket structure in any ongoing way that  should concern us? 11/6/01 6

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I don’t think so. The cash m arket continued to function normally.  There did not seem  to be a spillover into the cash m arket.  That m ight have occurred if the on-the-run/off-the -run spreads had widened, but we di d not see that.  The problem rem ained a back office problem  that did not sp ill over in to the  front of fice.  Of course, there is th e risk tha t that might happen at som e point but thus far it has been contained to the back office. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yet the Treasur y reopened the 10-ye ar due to obvious concerns about--

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. That’s right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What was the Treasu ry worried about other than fails?  On the face of it, fails seem  to be a disru ption to th e norm al market process.  If fails are b enign, why does anybody really ca re all that m uch? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I think it’s the risk  that I mentioned--that if th e back office gets clogged up, then it affects how the traders beh ave. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Has that ever happened? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I can’t think of an instance when it has.  In 1998 we had a different situation where liqu idity was an is sue, and on- the-run /off-the-run spreads widened then.  But I can’t think of an instance where we had that k ind of spillover p roblem  because of fails.  Again, that was a risk th at the Treasury was contending with, a nd I think it is the reason  they m ade the decision that they did. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. Historically, Mr. Chairm an, the Treasu ry has been co ncerned that an environm ent in which investors are not sure they actually will receive the security th ey purchased foreign central banks were not m aking their secu rities  availab le in the m arket becau se they were o n the receiving end of fails too. They’d lend the secu rities out but were n’t getting them  back.  So they 11/6/01 7 securities. I think the Treas ury’s argum ent is that if fails conti nue for a protracted period, then at the 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I was  slightly di stracted, Dino, when you were explaining why it is tha t the J apanes e banks ar e willing to ta ke the lowe r yield ing 5-y ear swaps r ather than JGBs. Did you say it w as for tax reasons? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. There’s a preferential accounting treatment for swaps rela tive to JGBs; the latter go on their balance sheets. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  You m ean in term s of their capital? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. In part I think for reasons related to capital.  Also, a bank m ay be influenced by not wanting to balloo n its balance sheet, which is published.  The Japanese accoun ting au thorities are look ing at chang ing that p referential treatm ent becaus e the Japanes e banks are us ing it as a loophole. The swap is designed to be what they ca ll a m acro hedge--that is, it is designed to hedge assets--and it can be excluded fr om the balance sheet.  However, as the Japanese accounting authorities s ee it, the ban ks are us ing these swaps to hedge lia bilities, which m ore or less turns the intent of the rules on its head. So the accounting authorities have b een looking at this and thinking about whether to close that loophole. There is so me pressure on them  to continue to keep that loophole op en, and I th ink the banks are waiting to see how the Japanese acc ounting bodies will rule. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  I’d like  to add a comment.  However the accounting authorities rule, the situation is clearly one in wh ich the Japanese banks are taking a massive interest rate risk at a tim e when they have enough risks in the portfolio.  And this practice involves an additional risk that th ey should not be taking.  Wearing m y Basel Comm ittee hat, I have been try ing to bring th at to the ir attention with ab solute ly no positiv e result. 11/6/01 8 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Any negative results? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  No, they just continue to ignore that risk. Essentially, anything that will p roduce som e additional earnin gs, however great the ris k, is a risk that the banks are willing to take. And as Dino pointed out very w ell, if the Japanese governm ent has to start issuing more governm ent bonds in order to bail out the banking system, whatever is accom plished by putting in additiona l capital cou ld eas ily be reversed by the hit the ba nks will take on the in terest rate risk.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. In looking at a whole range of spreads--on-the-run, off-the run, bid-ask spreads, and risk spreads on different kinds of pa per--could y ou characterize th e state of the m arkets in recent days, relative to, let’s say, just bef ore the terrorist attacks ? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Well, in term s of how t he markets are functioning, I think they are functioning fine. In term s of how m arket participants are discrim inating am ong risks, I would have no reason to second-guess the assessm ents they are m aking.  They  seem  to be putting in a greater risk prem ium on high-yield assets and on debt of emerging m arkets.  So, to the ex tent that they are viewing the econom ic outlook as being weaker than had been the case, they are putting in a higher risk prem ium to those kinds of assets, wh ich seems to be ra tional. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Right. But the spreads that would indicate how the m arket itself is functioning, such as bid-ask spreads, are back pretty m uch to where they were? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I don’t recall that there has been any m eaningful wideni ng of bid-ask spreads in the fixed incom e markets.  And the on-the-run/ off-the-run spread has not m oved very m uch.  So those indicators are not pointing to probl ems with the functioning of the markets. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Okay. 11/6/01 9

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Further comm ents or questions?  Mr. Vice Chair, would you m ake your usual m otion? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  I move ap proval of the dom estic operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Without objection, they are appr oved.  We now m ove on to Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  In my remarks at the last  meeting, I said that if we were pressed to net the various ri sks to our projection of real activity, we saw greater downsid e risks in the near term and greater upside risks further out. The data we have  received over the past m onth seem  to have supported that view. We are now showing a m uch sharper contraction in real GDP into early next year than was incorporated in our previous projection.  But, by the spring, we anticip ate a stronger recovery.  Partly on the thought that the m ore pronounced near-term  weakness in the econom y will  spur additional action by Congress, we have built a more  stim ulative f iscal p olicy into th is projection. That added stim ulus, along with stronger equi ty prices and a slightly lower assum ed federal funds rate, underlie  the upward adjustm ent to our longer-term forecast. So, how we ak is the econom y likely to  be over the near term ?  As we noted in the Greenbook supplem ent on Frid ay, the October labor m arket report led us to m ark down further the projected contraction in rea l GDP in the curren tquarter from about 2-1/2 per cent at an annual rate to 3 percent.  And with output and incom es weaker now, there will likely  be som e spillover in the form  of further declines in dem and early next y ear, leading us to revise down our first-quarter drop in real GDP to about 1/2 percen tage point.  Even before receiving the October employm ent figures, we had been impressed by the exceptional weakness of the m anufacturing sector; sharp inventory liquidations appear to be continuing this quart er, and the con traction in capital spending is intens ifying.  Moreover, reports have suggested that the service sector is softening noticeably. The concern s raised by those develo pments were  certainly reinforced by last Friday’s em ploym ent report.  Private payroll em ploym ent dropped nearly 440,000 last m onth, aggregate production wo rker hours fell 0.7 percent, and the unem ployment rate rose 1/2 percentage point to 5.4 per cent--all weaker readings than we had expected. To be sure, some of our miss on em ploym ent was in industries that have been directly affect ed by the events of Septem ber 11--for exam ple, airlines, travel, and hospitality.  We had cutbacks in these areas s pread out over the next few m onths, and we m ay have just gotten those cuts sooner than we had anticipated. But the decl ines were deep enough and widespread 11/6/01 10 enough to make us reluctant to offset any of that larger drop in com ing months.  The bottom  line is tha t we see the labor m arket report as sig naling a g reater n ear-term contraction in activity. That certainly seems to be the case  in the manufacturing sector, where the sharp drop in factory hours and the reduction in temporary help jobs--many of which are supplied to the goods-produci ng sector--indicate that the rate of off around 1-1/2 percent for the month, se tting up a possible double-digit annual rate of decline for the fourth quarter. Those cutbacks in production are in  large part a reflection of the ongoing efforts of businesses to pare inventor ies.  As a result of those actions, as well as the surge in auto sales, we are projecting a substantial inventory liquidation of $80 billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter.  Still, not much progress has yet been evident in reducing inventory-sales ratios. The reason, of course, has been th at final demand also has been weakening, especially the demand for investment goods.  The falloff in new orders for capital equipment in September was stunning.  As with all of the statistical reports for September, there may be less signal than usual in these data. But it is difficult for us to see how these readings could be pointing to anything other than a very steep drop in  equipment spending in coming months.  Indeed, the revision that we have made  to investment spending accounts for a large fraction of the downward adjustment to our current-quarter forecast. As you know, we incorporated a su bstantial hit to  business and consumer confidence in our September projection--a feature that we have maintained in this forecast.  Thus far, we feel quite comfortable with that assumption for the business sector.  The cutbacks in employment, production, and capital spending have been swift and sizable.  And our business contacts, who have been gloomy most of the year, ha ve turned decidedly more so this fall. However, I think it would be fair to  say that there is still a large question mark about our assumption of a c onsiderable sustained deterioration of consumer confidence.  To begin with th e obvious, at the same time that payrolls were being slashed by more than at any tim e in the past twenty years, sales of new motor vehicles soared to near-record levels.  In our view, that surge has been induced by temporary incentives, and a payback is in store late this year and early next year--an outlook that la rgely appears to be shared by the automakers.  But these developments could give one pause about our story. Moreover, while we have seen significant deterioration in measures of consumer sentiment, the declines have not been as large as we had been expecting. For now, we are sticking with  our assumption that recent events have shaken consumer confidence and that ther e will be an unusual degree of restraint 11/6/01 11 on household spending over the next few quart ers.  But that outcom e is far from a sure bet. We have now come to that familia r part of my presentation, where I recite for you the catechism of recove ry.  It should sound familiar because neither the questions nor the answers have changed all that much since last economy to a more vigorous growth track?  If it’s any comfort to you, I did have our crack research staff examine the histor ical record, and they confirmed for me that there have been no instances, at leas t in the United States, of recessions that never ended. [Laughter] So, I am reasonably confident that, with your indulgence, if we stick with  this story long enough, it s hould eventually come to pass. However, when is another matter.  In our view, the basic elements appear to be in place for an uptur n in activity by the spring. The inventory liquidation will end, and even its abatement will provide support to production and inco mes; in our projection, the runoff proceeds throughout much of next year, but it becomes a progressively smaller drag on real output. Much the same can be said for the capital spending adjustment.  We do not expect an upturn  in spending before the second half of 2002, but the significant negatives from this sector diminish as businesses better align actual and desired cap ital stocks and as sales prospects begin to improve. The risks to this aspect of our proj ection remain considerable.  As we noted in our report to the Committee in J une, econometric models of investment spending leave a great deal to be desire d.  Consequently, it is difficult to use these equations with confidence to ga uge where we are in the adjustment process. We do, however, have pretty good company here.  The businesses that purchase and produce capital goods have fa iled to foresee the extent of the weakness in capital spending that has emer ged this year.  If excessive optimism lifted capital spending above the fundament als in recent years, it seems possible for excessive pessimism to depress spending below the fundamentals for a time.  We have built a bit of that effect into  our forecast through an assumed weakening of business confidence, but the retrenchme nt in spending could continue to be more pronounced and more persistent than we have allowed for. While the risks remain large, our be st guess is that the inventory and investment adjustments will largely play out over the first half of next year, and will do so in an environment that receives considerable support from macroeconomic policies.  By our estima tes, the real federal funds rate is noticeably below its equilibrium value, s uggesting to us that monetary policy is calibrated to produce above-t rend growth once the tran sitory drags on spending wane. Fiscal policy, too, is an im portant  part of the story.  We have substantia lly incre ased th e size of  the f iscal s timulus package assum ed in our 11/6/01 12 forecast, and  that add ed stim ulus shows through to the top lin e of our projection.  Two salient questions ar e:  Will it ha ppen, and will it be as p otent a s we are anticipating?   I recognize that reading the newspape rs in recent weeks m ight raise serious doubts about th e likelihood of passing a si zable stim ulus package, and grid lock is cer tainly within th e realm of possi bility.  But, we believe that, with the full dim ensions of the downtur n becom ing increasingly apparent, efforts will r esume to rea ch a co mprom ise. The precise composition of any pack age is very uncertain, and we make no claim of special insight into how the political process will unfold.  We took a stab by combining elements that ha ve appeared palatable to both sides in the debate. We assume anot her round of tax rebates wi ll be paid in the first quarter to those that did not fully par ticipate in the last round.  We built in additional spending for extended unem ployment insurance and increased subsidies for health insurance for th e unemployed.  We also are assuming increased spending for infrastructure and security.  Finally, we incorporated a three-year temporary tax incentive for i nvestment that allows an immediate 30 percent expensing of qualified equipment a nd software expenditures; this is the provision incorporated in the House stimulus bill. All told, our revised fiscal package adds nearly a percentage point to growth of real GDP in 2002 and about 1/ 2 percentage point to growth in 2003.  Tax rebates are paid out early next year and are assumed to be largely spent in the first half.  By the middle of 2002, we expect the expensing provision to provide an appreciable lift to equipm ent spending.  As we noted in the Greenbook, because the provision is tem porary, we expect the effect on investment outlays to be larger than if it were permanent.  One reason is that the budgetary cost is lower, and there shoul d be less offset through higher interest rates. Moreover, the temporary nature of the incentive will cause businesses to pull forward purchases that would have  been made after the provision’s expiration. We have heard the argument that investment incentives, such as the one we have incorporated into the proj ection, will not be effective in a period when the demand for capital goods has been  so weak.  Quite frankly, we do not find this argument very c onvincing.  To be sure, for some firms, tax incentives will not forestall further cuts  in their capital budgets.  But even with the steep have still purchased nearly $1 trillion of equipment.  So there must be many firms that are on the margin for some categories of capital outlays and for which the expensing provision will induce additional spending. There are, however, plenty of other good reasons for second-guessing the staff forecast on this issue.  In buildi ng the effect of the tax provision into our forecast of E&S spending, we have assumed only a muted effect in the first half of next year. In our view, there will be only a small penalty to be paid for 11/6/01 13 waiting to take advantage of the provision until a bit more  clarity develops in the economic outlook.  In our forecast, clea rer signs of improvement should be apparent by next spring, at which point  we project the stimulus from the expensing provision to mount. This tim ing was largely a judgment call, and either a quicker or a more delayed response seems possible. One small side effect of demand stimulus that occurs through an investment incentive--such as is incorporat ed in this forecast--is that it raises capital deepening and productivity growth for a time, with consequences for the inflation outlook. Along with a somewhat higher projected valu e of the dollar, these positive supply influences offs et a slightly lower path for the unemployment rate, leaving measures of core price inflation on a modest but more noticeable downtrend by 2003. In sum, the risks surrounding our economic forecast remain wide, but, in our view, are two-sided. Rising equity prices, a steep yield curve, and soaring motor vehicle sales might be pointing to a fundamentally sounder economic outlook than we presented in the Gree nbook.  On the other hand, last Friday’s employment data capped a long string of very weak reports on the economy and could be signaling that businesses are prepared to act aggressively to cut production and shed workers. In these circumstances, households will be vulnerable to a bout of deepening pessimism and significant spending restraint in coming months. On that cheery thought, I’ll turn you over to Karen Johnson.

MS. JOHNSON. We revised down our  forecast for growth of real output abroad once again in this Greenbook. In part, we were reacting to the information received over the intermeeting period about  production and spending in foreign economies.  In part, we were recognizing that more pronounced weakness in the U.S. economy in the very  near term implied more of the same for many of our trading part ners.  We now estimate that real GDP contracted at an annual rate of about 1/2 percent duri ng the third quarter and expect that a similar outcome will be recorded for th e current quarter.  This projection of prolonged contraction in our average measure of fore ign real output reflects widespread negative growth among the developing countries during the second half of this year.  Among the industria l countries, recession in Japan is ongoing while the picture elsewhere is mixed: Real output appears to have turned down in Canada, to have become stagnant, at  best, in the euro area, but to have continued to show a bit of re silience in the United Kingdom. In constructing this forecast, we stru ggled with the need to specify the intensity and duration of the downturn ab road.  The Greenbook baseline paints a picture of a global economy that is sluggish in the first half of  next year and has clearly begun to rebound by the second half.  Although we can identify the factors that we think will li e behind this path, we would be the first to admit that 11/6/01 14 picking the turning point requires a crystal ball rather than an econom ic model.  In addition, news since the Greenbo ok fo recast was finalized reinforces the downside ris ks to the b aseline. Our forecast calls for improvement in the developing countries to be evident early in the new year.  For ma ny Asian emerging market economies, this outcome will depend importantly on an end to the deterioration in the demand for high-tech goods and the beginnings of a recovery in production in that sector.  It will depend as well on continued robus t expansion in China, one of the few countries or regions in the global economy that has not shared in the widespread slowdown. Stability in globa l oil prices at recent lo wer levels will help, along with supportive macroeconomic policy in some of these countries. The widespread recovery of foreign activity during 2002 depends critically on the rebound that is projected for the United States.  Simply put, we are counting on the range of direct a nd indirect linkages--through which the slowing of U.S. growth over the past y ear imparted downward pressure on the rest of the world--to transmit positive spillovers.  Strengthening of the U.S. economy will boost confidence, support asset prices, stimulate demand for exports from our trading partners to the United States, and contribute to a recovery in investment spending.  For the major industrial countries, domestic policy stimulus of varying amounts is in  the pipeline.  Since their respective peaks, official lending rates to date  have been lowered 300 basis points in Canada, 150 basis points in the United Ki ngdom, and 100 basis points in the euro area. We are expecting another 25 ba sis points soon by each of these three central banks, perhaps later this week in  some cases, and a further 25 basis points by the ECB sometime in the first half of 2002.  Fiscal stimulus was injected during 2001 in Canada, the United Kingdom, and several of the major euro-area countries. We expect some additional expansionary measures during 2002 in Canada and the United Kingdom, wher e surpluses allow more room for maneuver.      Two spots in the global economy--Japan  and Argentina--are especially troubled by problems that are largely, but  not entirely, domestic.  The latest releases of economic indicators paint a bl eak picture for real economic activity in Japan. And we see little in the prospects fo r either monetary or fiscal policy that could spark a turnaround in spending .  The supplementary budget that now seems on track for passage in the Diet soon will provide a partia l offset to what would otherwise be a large contractionary  impulse from fiscal policy.  But we do not see the measures now planned as up to the task of preventi ng further declines in real GDP during the first half of 2002. By the second half of next year, we have projected an anemic return to positive growth as private investment spending stops falling and stabilizes and as exports swing from declining to increasing. Both of these developm ents depend importantly on a general recovery in the global economy, in cluding in the high-tech sector. 11/6/01 15The situation in Argentina is evolving as we speak. The chaotic events of last week have brought into the open the pros pect of a sovereign debt restructu ring that now se ems inevitab le.  The scope and term s of such a restructuring are slowly being pr oposed.  Spreads on Argentine dollar-denom inated sovereign debt spiked a bove 2500 basis points yesterday, as the cents on the dollar. Deposit outflow s from Argentine banks, where pesos and dollars still exchange one for one, have risen over the past week or so and shipm ents of dollar currency from  U.S.  banks to Argentine counterparts have again jum ped.  Two “events ” appeared to accelerat e the downward spiral of the ongoing Argentine crisis last week.  One was the apparent failure of the de la Rua governm ent to reach agreem ent w ith key provincial governors over the dispute about revenue sh aring between the provinces and the federal governm ent.  Some comprom ise is needed in order for the governm ent to achieve its stated fiscal ob jectives.  A second bit of “news” was the statem ent by an IMF official during a press confer ence that acceleration of the plann ed thus quashing widespread expectations that those funds would be distributed shortly. Late in the week, Argentine officials ap parently felt the need to announce som ething, so President de la Rua m ade a statem ent on Argentine television that included som e minor re forms of the tax and pension system s aimed at stimulating the econom y.  He also called for a debt exchange, with the intent of reducing interest costs on the debt , particularly in the near term , but as of now there is no proposal for additional funds from  the IMF or other sources to support an “orderly ” exchange.  The governm ent’s explicit po sition to date is that there will be no change in the current exchange rate regim e.   In our Green book forecast, we have  projected th at real GDP will 2003. While the actual path will no doubt differ from  this, a substantial decline in output in Argentina is  unavoidable over th e forecas t perio d.  Our current thinking is that negative spillov ers to real output growth of other countries in the region will be lim ited.  This round of problem s in Argentina has been unfolding for about a year, and financial m arket de velopm ents support the view that m arket participants do distinguish both Brazil and Mexico from  Arge ntina.  Spreads for Brazil rem ain around 1100, with those fo r Mexico m uch lower, and both the Brazilian real and th e Mexican peso have appreciated on balance over the interm eeting period.  Thus, despite the im ponderables of the Argentine situation, we see average output growth in Latin Am erica turning positive next year and strengthening further in 2003, sim ilar to  the pattern projected for the Asian emerging market econo mies and the foreign industrial countries.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Moskow. 11/6/01 16 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I have a question for David. You mentioned in your comm ents the possibility of w eaker household spending and, of course, that was one of the alternative scenarios that you had in the Greenbook as  well.  The Greenbook analysis indicated that under this  alternative scenario households w ould react m ore adversely than you anticipate in  the baseline for ecast.  I was wondering if you c ould elabo rate on what you’re antic ipating in tha t case, particula rly in term s of e xternal shocks su ch as terrorist attack s and anthrax scares that are so im portant to household spe nding and consum er confidence.  Could you provide some more detail about what you are a ssum ing in each of th ese altern atives? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Certain ly.  In ou r baseline forecas t, we h ave assum ed a significan t hit to consum er confidence, one that is by our es timates sufficient to s ubtract roughly 3/4 of a percentage point from  real GDP growth in 2002.  So in the baseline scenario we are already expecting som e additional wea kness--an exogenous h it--beyond the weakening in consum er confidence one would expect as the econom y weakens.  We have that also influencing business spending in ways that w e tried to calibrate, a spil lover effect to other forms of spending as in other periods when there have been outsized movements in consum er confide nce.   In our alternative sim ulations, version one rem oves that cons umer confidence effect from the forecast so that you can get a se nse of what it implies.  In essence th e stronger grow th in th at simulation is sufficient with unchanged policy to  bring the unem ploym ent rate back down to 5 percen t or so by the end  of the forecast horizon.   The second version, which is the even m ore pessim istic version, assum es a further percentage point rise in the pe rsonal saving rate--again, an exogenous further change--and again with consequences and fallout for the rest of the ec onomy.  That produces a m uch weaker econom y and a 11/6/01 17 much higher unem ployment rate.  In that scenario , with an unchanged policy the unem ploym ent rate moves up to 7-1/4 percent by the en d of the forecast horizon. I think there are two im portant and related risk s in this projection.  One, in the baseline projection, we have som e weakness in consumer c onfidence but we don’t really have a com plete collapse in the consum er sector.  And with som e turnaround in activity by the m iddle of next year, we get through this period of economic weakness w ithout a really large dec line in GDP.  One of the risks we’v e been highlig hting f or some time is that  we’r e not highly conf ident that co nsum ers will be able to withstand the kind of weakness we are cu rrently projecting in the near term .  That could obviously lead to a bigg er fall in con fidence that will feed back on the econo my with fallout th at extends into late 2002 and into 2003.  As I noted in m y remarks, cer tainly the data that we have received since the last G reenbook have n't been especially weak for the consum er side.  Yes, we did see a very significant drop in retail sales in September and we expect so me of that to be offset.  But even that drop in sales and the decline we’ve seen in consum er confide nce have not been so large as to make us think that we are already in the pr ocess of a confidence contraction.  Whatever one makes of  21 m illion un its of  motor vehicle sales- -and as I said, we have pretty  much written tha t off as a signal of stronger consum er spending--it does at least pose in our m inds som e question about whether we have that sto ry righ t.  I think we will begin to s ee in the nex t couple of m onths whether our forecas t is correct.  A significan t payback in  the auto sector will confirm our view that there is going to be weakness in consum er spending.  But right now that’s still a f orecast. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  In your “weaker household sp ending” alternative, as you look forward do you envision a m ore or less stable environm ent in term s of t he terr orist threat that w e’re facing? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. That’s a very good point. The answer is  more stable.  We have not built in esc alating ter rorist ac tivitie s in the United States that would eithe r signif icantly affect 11/6/01 18 consum er confidence or add signifi cantly f urther to busines s costs.  I wouldn’t even know how to begin to p roduce such a forecast.  But certain ly there are som e significan t risks.  Just as anthrax h as been a concern in the past m onth, it could be sm allpox the next m onth and som ething even worse the following month. I don’t think ou r forecast begins to  capture the poten tial consequen ces of that f or consum er and business confidence.  Nor does it capture  the hit we m ight take to the productivity and business co st structure.   

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. David, I just wanted to probe a bit m ore on the im pact you project from  the assum ed passage of legislation regarding a partial expensing provisi on.  If you’re right in your projection, that won’t m ake m uch of an im pact until we get to the se cond quarter of 2002.  But from  then on the effect is fairly significant.  The analys is seem s solid, but in an env ironm ent where we have so much excess  capacity an d a great deal of pessim ism, intuitively it’s a little hard f or me to connect to it. Could you elaborate a little on that?   In pa rticular, I wondered if you looked at this at all from  a disaggregated standpoint .  In other words, I’m  asking wh at particular industries m ight react strongly to this provision if it is passed. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. We certainly did look at it at a disaggregated level.  Perhaps m y colleague, David W ilcox, can talk about the underl ying theory of how we  embedded this in the forecast in term s of its potential im plications for different kin ds of capital spending, in particular on shorter-lived versus longe r-lived assets.  Obviously this provision has a larger  effect on the cost of capital for longer-lived a ssets than for shorter-lived assets.  If you consider, for exam ple, the computer area where prices are declining by 30 percen t a year, the advan tage of the ex pensing provision m ay not be quite so significant in term s of m oving up any spendi ng.  So, we have looked 11/6/01 19 at it by industry but we certainly  haven’t gone through a very detail ed disaggregated analysis.  But incorporate this effect. 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  There’s not a lo t to go on.  We don’t have clea n, historical experim ents.  We have som e elegant theory and som e consens us param eters.  We attempted to calibrate sim ulation models to va lues th at we think a re sen sible and that in other circum stances produce reasonable results. But history is not repl ete with tem porary investm ent tax incentives of the kind that we’re simulating here.  And Congress is not notorious for following through in ev ery respect with the specifics of its original announcem ent.  So one possi ble risk that could atte nuate the effect of the investm ent incentive is that, contrary to our a ssumption in the Greenbook, businesses m ay doubt  that in fact the in centiv e will be allowe d to expire at the end of the th ree-year period.  In that cas e the provision w ouldn’t spu r as m uch investm ent as we ha d assu med will tak e place.  That said, ther e is econom etric evidence that at least helps us to narrow the range of uncertainty a bit.  We have a view about the long-run elasticity of the capital stock with respect to the cost of capital.  We have som e evidence on speeds of adjustm ent.  We tried to piece togeth er those b its of evidence using a simulation model to get a handle on how big an effect the proposed legislation m ight have. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Dave, one of your comments in your presentation surpri sed m e a little, and that was the link that you descri bed between capital deepening, productivity, and inflation.  You emphasized the im plications of a temporary invest ment incentive that raises investm ent, spurs additional capital deepening, and leads in a se nse to a positive supply shock.  In the Greenbook, though, it seem s to m e your em phasis was that o n balance w e face a neg ative supply shock becau se 11/6/01 20 of a significant slowing in struct ural productivity growth  that is expected to occur for a couple of reasons, including a slow down from  an unsustain able pace of technology spending and  also th e reallocation of resources to  security enhancem ents. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I should have been clearer ab out that.  My rem ark in the briefing was really referring to the revisions  that w e have m ade in the fo recast, which involved a downward revision in our price forecast at the sam e time that we’re show ing a lower unem ployment rate.  A piece of that story was th e sligh tly faster capita l deepening in 2003 that ha s been stim ulated by the faster investm ent in late 2002 and 2003.  You’re absolutely right.  As we noted in the Greenbook, you could look at the very sharp de celeration that we ar e projecting in wage inflation and, if you were so inclined, wonder why that is not showing through m ore forcefully into our price inflation forecast. The reason is that even with the im provem ent in structural prod uctiv ity th at we expect to see by 2003, the gains are still well below where they had been earlier .  And we see this on net as a factor lim iting the extent of the disinflation that we are likely to see over the next two years as businesses respond to that and atte mpt to rebuild m argins that have  becom e compressed significantly in the last year or so. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Just to follow up on that, the sl owdown in structural productivity grow th is really quite significan t into 2002 in particular.  We becam e som ewhat fam iliar with the com plicated dynam ics of how that plays out on dem and as well as inflation when we had an acceleration in structural productiv ity, so this is perhaps a factor th at we sho uld weigh in  our real forecast as well. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOC KTON.  I agree with that.  We’re not showing very m uch disinflation in the course of 2002 in part because of the unwinding of  the positive productivity shock that we saw on the other side. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Parry. 11/6/01 21

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Dave, I have a question and also a comm ent a bout the forecast.  In looking at the sources of weakness in the short term , a larg e portion of it com es from residential investm ent.  It strik es me that there certainl y are som e positive funda mentals in this area.  In September, for exam ple, starts continued to increase.  Moreover, the financial fundam entals in housing are still quite good and the falloff in perm its was actually quite sm all. I can see that the negative effects of higher unem ployment rates and  the im pact on confidence m ight be playing a role, but why does that seem to have so m uch of a role in the residential sect or and, in m y view, not m uch of a role in personal consum ption expenditu res?  I ask b ecause in you r forecas t personal con sumption expenditures in the current quarter and even in the subse quent quarter aren’t all that weak. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I’d note a couple of points.  One is that our proj ected falloff in single family starts is not dramatic; it ’s certainly not dram atic if one thought we were witnessing a typical recession. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Eight-tenths of a pe rcentage po int of the decline in re al GDP this quar ter is due to residential investm ent, and that’s a sm all sector. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. We believe our starts foreca st is reasonably ali gned with the decline in perm its th at we saw a nd with what we think w ill be som e depress ing effect from the weakening  in incom e growth.  And we built in so me additiona l weakness because of the assum ptions we’ve made about consu mer sentim ent.  So that is one of the places where the confid ence effect shows up.  We also noted th at hom ebuilders have reported a no ticeable falloff in both traf fic and home sales recen tly.  Again, none o f this is sugg estiv e of a m ajor weakening in that sect or; by my view what we built in is ac tually f airly m ild.  Certainly the pe rcentage ch ange at an ann ual rate look s fairly large because, as you noted, it is a relatively sm all sector.  But that would be one of the upside risks that I think we were talking about in term s of how things have held up in the household sector.  I think one 11/6/01 22 would have to say that housing al so is an area where we have not  seen the extent of weakness one might have anticipated.  So that w ould be a part of the upside risk that w e see asso ciated with ou r assum ptions about extra weakness in the househ old sector coming from  confidence effects. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do you know if ther e is anything special in the adjustm ent that goes from starts to v alue put in p lace that wo uld be invo lved in th is change? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Well, th ere is  a bit in the res idential i nvestm ent forecast because the falloff in construction p ut in place h as been greater fo r hom es at th e high end than at the low end.  So the cost per start has been falling as well and th at certainly adds to that weakness.     

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  I think that’s an issue. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. But we do still have a fallo ff in single -family hom e starts in the quarter to 1. 2 million un its.  That is a noticeable drop. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I also have a comm ent about  the partial expensing investm ent tax incentive. Given that the proposal is for a three-year period, and r ecognizing som e of the points Al Broaddus made--that the capacity uti lization rate is so low and that the current econom ic situation is so poor and likely to remain so for a while--why w ouldn’t the resultant inve stment be back-loaded more?   The lead tim es needed for m uch of the eq uipm ent are short.  I don’t know how you m ade the spread it in a way that is m uch m ore back-loaded than you did. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. We certainly could have and we debated that.  In the end, as I noted, more judgment than science was ap plied to how we spread it out. I would sound one note of caution about assum ing that a provision like this won’t be important by the m iddle of next year.  When the econom y starts to im prove, there is a fair am ount of tinder that can be ac cumulated in term s of stimulus from both federal tax a nd spending provisions, from  moneta ry policy, and so forth.  While 11/6/01 23 we’re sitting here now in the m idst of a significa nt contraction in output, it’s obviously difficult to envision why businesses would be very excited a bout using an expensing provision.  But com ing on the heels of a year-and-a-half of significant contrac tion in cap ital spendin g, there could be a rush to take advan tage of this in centiv e as sales prospects begin to improve .  I wouldn’t rule out even an upside r isk to how we built this in; I think th ere are r isks on both sides.  Firm s may wait until th ey are absolutely certain that the economy is on a path  of trend or above-trend growth before they are induced by this provision to raise spending. On th e other hand, there could be som e reasons as well for them  to want to take advantag e of it early on, especially while prices in the capital goods m arkets are on the low side. I can’t say that  we offer m uch science here and, as I indicated, this is an area where we feel quite comfortable with your seco nd-guessing us.  But I think you could second-guess us in either direction. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  There’s also the risk  that the provision will be not for three years but for one or two years. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOC KTON.  Another ris k, too, is that the provision could be sm aller than now anticipated. This is no t a very large tem porary investm ent incentive.  If the window were m ade shorter, we m ight see a more imm ediate effect.  Or if the amount that can be expensed were less- -along the lines of the 10 or 15 perc ent people have talked about as a com promise--the effects could be even m ore muted than we have in this forecast.  So there is  a lot of  uncertainty.  In the end we f elt uncomfortable com ing to you with a baseline proj ection that com pletely ignored what we thought were cum ulating signs of additional fiscal stim ulus.  We had a very m odest am ount of fiscal stim ulus in our last projection and our best guess of the m ode is m ore along the lines  of what we’re showing now. But as I indicated, it’s cer tainly possible th at gridlock will r easse rt itself and nothing will happen. 11/6/01 24

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Have we gotten any greater visi bility about what is  likely to happen in terms of Congression al action on this? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. All I know is what I read in the newspapers, and that has not been terribly encouraging. Yet this wo uld be the tim e when we m ight in  fact not expect to hear m uch encouraging news, as parties on both sides position th emselves for the hard negotiations that, at least in our view, will prob ably need to ta ke place in the next m onth or so. 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  I’d like to underscore two points that Dave m ade earlier.  First, what we have built into the Greenbook projec tion is not a straight read of our m odel sim ulation.  We did very substantially push back the investm ent response to  the tax incentive precis ely on the theory that businesses m ight plausibly respond to  the heightened clim ate of uncer tainty over the next couple of quarters by opting to wait. They m ight well decide in  the co ntext of a th ree-y ear incentive--if it does last that lon g--tha t there’s very li ttle penalty to waiting until som e of that uncertainty is resolved.  Secondly, we observed f rom the experience with auto sales in October that at  least in a different context econom ic actors do respond qu ite vigorously and quickly to som ething that is seen as a temporary sale on a large capital item, na mely motor vehicles in this case. It’s conceivable that businesses m ay respond in a sim ilar way.   

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. That incentive is for a pe riod of months versus three years. 

[SECTION]

MR. W ILCOX.  I will grant that the duration m akes a big d ifference.      

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. I’ve been thinking about what we might see in som e of the data that w ill be published over the near term , in particular payroll employm ent and the impact of seasonal factors.  I assum e, other th ings eq ual, that the seasonals an ticipate an increas e in employm ent in Decem ber and  11/6/01 25 probably in Nove mber, although I’m not sure, and then som e runoff in the first part of next year.  Is that right? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Yes, and I think even in Oc tober we reach the front edge of a pickup in seasonal hiring. Obviously that  seem s less likely and is part of  the reason why we would expect ongoing substantial weakness in the em ploym ent data.  

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Right. So even if we don’t get further substantia l employm ent reductions, the season ally adjus ted numbers are likely to look  fairly lou sy. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Yes. We are expecting payro ll em ployment to contin ue to contract at more than 200,000 a m onth over the next few m onths and to contract rather  sharply in the first quarter of next year as well. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Okay, thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I have a question about the inte rpretation of  interes t rate developm ents.  In the pre-FOMC briefing  you m entioned the com mon view in the m arketplace that the budget deficit had som ething to do with the behavior of longer-term  interest rates.  It wasn’t clear what your ow n view on that was. I was interested in Chart 1 in yesterday’s B oard briefing where you plotted the implied one-year forward rates, which currently are not  that different five y ears out from those that prevailed on January 2nd, let’s say. I would have expected  the budget argum ent to m ake a big difference--to see m ore effect on interest rates, say, five years out and beyond the current cyclical situation. Yet those curves are no t that dissim ilar.  In fact, the longer end is actually lower now, which is not consistent with th e argum ent involving the erosion of  the budget surplu s.  Would you offer your own view on that?  11/6/01 26

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Sure. I’d say two things. One, we do think that the longer-run budget outlook and the accom panying fiscal policy that u nderl ie that outlook hav e been facto rs influencin g long-term  interest rates.  When I look at that im plied one-year forward rate , it currently is showing those rates rising above levels that w ere prevailing in January --though you’re right, not by a huge amount.  However, the o ther news th at we have r eceived since January --this enorm ous contractio n in capital spending--would have been a factor worki ng to depress the view about where equilibrium real interest rates m ight be going in that period.  So, in our view , we have seen som e effect of the fiscal policy on the structure of inte rest rates and  that certain ly is a facto r in interpreting what has happened. It’s quite clear in our m odels--and we think there’s som e reasonably sound econom ic theory for this view--that equilibrium  long-term  real interest rates would be  related to the long-run thrust of fiscal policy. So that’s our interpr etation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Any further ques tions for our colleagues?  If not, who would like to star t the C ommittee discussion?   President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, the fallout from  the Septem ber 11 attacks has intensified existing weakness in the Twelfth Di strict economy.  The high-tech sect or has been struggling for the past year and now the tim eline fo r recovery has been pushed back by business firm s in the afterm ath of the attacks. The latest figures show that Ca lifornia’s high-tech m anufact urers reduced payrolls by more than 1 2,000 in the third qu arter alone, which accounts f or nearly half of the 29,000 jobs lost on net in the state. The im pact has b een especially  visible in the San Franci sco Bay area office m arket where vacan cy rates recently ros e above those in Los Angeles  for the first tim e in recent m emory.  And with struggling com panies acco unting for much  of the space m ade availab le through subleases, the full financial ef fect on landl ords has yet to be felt.   11/6/01 27More generally, construction ac tivity has fallen th roughout th e District in recent m onths and a sharp drop in Septem ber may herald further weakening. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Is that  residential and comm ercial? 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. It’s primarily comm ercial.  Southern California had been the m ain pocket of econom ic vitality in the Distri ct through August, showing  substant ial streng th in h ousing dem and and population-based services like education and health.  But weak  September em ploym ent num bers suggest that the slowdown m ay be taking hold there as well.  The slowdown in southern California will be ex acerbated by the ongoing reduction in travel spending resulting from  the terrorist attacks. Com pared to m ost areas of the c ountry, the Twelfth District is som ewhat more exposed to the travel slowdown, with states such as Hawaii and Neva da relying heavily on t ourism  dollars.  Although travel sectors over all are less critical to District activity th an the high- tech sector, a continued slowdown in trave l activity on th e order of  10 to 15 percen t will r educe District g rowth notice ably.  Some impacts of the travel slowdown already are evident, with the la test data on new unem ployment insu rance claim s confirm ing a sharp in crease in Distr ict layoffs, especially in Hawaii and Nevada,  in the week s following the attacks.  And Seattle will soon feel the im pact as well when Boeing initiates production cuts and im plements its planned layoffs of up to 20,000 commercial aircraft workers there. Moreove r, state and local governm ents and their creditors are on alert in much of the District as many areas expect significant revenue  shortfalls of up to 8 perc ent th is fiscal year com pared to pre -Septem ber 11 predic tions.  The negativ e impacts of  the travel slowdown will be offset som ewhat by increas ed spending on m ilitary hardware in som e areas, in cluding weapons system s manufactured in Arizona and southern California.  However, the am ounts spent by the federal governm ent are likely to represent only a partial offset, especia lly in the short term. 11/6/01 28 Let m e now turn to the m acro picture.  An official recess ion this year app ears unavoidable. With the October em ploym ent repor t, the data in hand now have the depth and duration to declare a recession. Furtherm ore, gi ven last summer’s weakness in various m onthly indicators, it seem s likely that th e start of the pres ent recess ion will be dated back in to the spring.  Looking ahead, the recession in our f orecast is no t as deep as the Greenbo ok’s.  But o ur projected recovery next year d evelops m ore slowly than in  the Greenb ook forecast.  Assum ing a funds rate of 2-1/4 percent, we anticipate a m ore gradual pickup  in growth, largely in response to monetary and fiscal policy  action s.  This recov ery prim arily m irrors the unusually gradual slowdown over the past year. It took  a year for real GDP to decelerate sl owly from  growth of about 1-1/2 p ercent during th e second half of last year to last qu arter’s decline of 0.4 percent.  This slow erosion of growth reflected a long sequence of causal shocks: the jum p in en ergy prices, the slowing in dem and abroad, the bursting of the asset price bubble, the related re-eva luation of desired capital stocks, and, of course, the events of Septem ber 11th. Some recess ions in the pas t resulted from  one big shock, but this  one seem s to have had m any causes.  The unwinding  of these m any shocks also will take tim e, and in our forecast, recovery progresses fairly s lowly.   Our inflatio n forecast is little revised .  Our best estim ate is for inflation of about 1-1 /2 percent in the core CPE price i ndex in 2002.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President McTeer.

MR. MCTEER. Econom ic activity in the Eleven th District continued to weaken over the past six weeks. Although the District econom y had probably begun to slump even before our last meeting, output declines now appear to be m ore pronounced and widespread.  Four of the District’s usual econom ic drivers--air trans portation, energy, border trade, and worker m igration--have turned from  plus to m inus.  As I m entioned last tim e, we certainly are sharing in the national econom ic 11/6/01 29 slowdown related to air travel, w ith Dallas a hub  for Am erican Air lines and Southwest, and Houston a hub for Continental. Activity in  our energy industry has slowed too, responding to a decline in oil and gas demand. Tighter secu rity at th e border also is ha ving a s ignificant neg ative effect on District econom ic activity.  On th e dem and side, far fewe r Mexican co nsum ers are willing to bear the increased hassle of gettin g across the border to shop in our stores .  They also have less money to spend owing to a decline in Mexican m aquiladora out put and U.S. tourism in Mexico.  Our directors from  border towns report a drop of 15 to 50 percent in  retail sales in their areas.  On the supply side, Mexican commuters who work in th e District face rush hour wait tim es of two to four hours to cross the border, whether they com e by c ar or by foot.  Some have even taken to riding bikes so they don’t have to stop to open the trunks of their vehicles. With all these drags on E leventh District output, virtually every econom ic statistic is signaling weakness. Septem ber’s announced layoffs in  the District jum ped to three tim es the norm for the year and October’s layoffs rem ain well above  earlier levels as well.  For the first tim e since we began constructing the Texas leading econom ic indicator inde x, every one of its components turned negative in September and overall the inde x showed the largest decline in its history.   About the only good news is that auto dem and and construction activity so far appear to be holding up fairly well. As reported in the Be ige Book, som e of the Dist rict’s industries m ost impacted by the terrorist attacks did see activity bounce back a bit du ring October.  But overall w e’re not expec ting District e mploym ent levels to rega in the ir previous highs u ntil som etime in the m iddle of 2002. The ripple effect has visibly spread out from  air travel and m ail service to hurt other businesses such as hotels, recreation, aircraft pro duction, travel services, a nd retail trade, and those effects are leveraged even furthe r through big declines in consum er confi dence.  Resources cannot 11/6/01 30 be allocated fast enough from  areas of excess supply, such as the air transporte rs, to those of excess demand--security for ex ample--to p revent la rge di slocations.  And the ne wly unem ployed high-tech workers are not lik ely candi dates for airport security jobs.  The adjustm ent is going to be very sluggish. It com forts m e som ewhat that the stock m arket is back up to roughly where it was before as the m arkets’ best opinion about our econom y’s re silience and its ability to bounce back.  Still, there is a long list of discourag ing current statistics: industria l production, capaci ty utilization, durable goods orders, retail sales,  existing hom e sales, initia l jobl ess claim s, consumer confidence, and m ore.  Those statistics set the overall tone for today.  The Greenbook increased its estim ate of the contraction in GDP in the fourth quarter and I suspect that last qu arter’ s num bers also are going to be revised down. Even so, we question whether the rebound is going to be as prompt or as strong as is shown in the Greenbook. Given the u nique natu re of our situation, where an unseen en emy is working accu rately to underm ine our confidence, I wonder if the forecast that we have for next y ear m ay be wishful thinking as well. Hunches and hopes are som ewhat  sick.  The risks are cl early on the downside for now and for the foreseeable future, and I’m  not su re monetary policy can do m uch more than it is already doing. Market participants  are insisting on further easing while  suggesting that it won’t help much. We keep saying the bias is  for further weakness, which is obviously true.  The m arkets keep taking that as a prom ise of m ore ease to com e and we  seem  to be afraid to disappoint them .  With a  2-1/2 percent fed funds rate and a 2 percent disc ount rate, this  may be a good tim e to begin the transition to a penalty discount rate, with a larger cut in the fed funds  rate than in the discount rate. 11/6/01 31I’m told that the defenders of the Alamo at least used up all their powder.  I suppose w e should too. But the Alamo story had a rather disc ouraging ending.  [Laughter ]  However, it would have played even less well in history had the Alamo’s defenders been found with dry powder.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I don ’t have a ny good stories about the Alam o or anything sim ilar.  On the Friday morning before Open Market Comm ittee meetings, I usually meet with a group of local investm ent professionals and econom ists from  the Dist rict’s largest banks.  This group has a pretty good take o n credit con ditions locally and natio nally, on m arket realities  and expectations, and o n risks in general. After a fairly gloom y go-around about near-term  prospects, I asked if anyone saw light at the end of the tunnel.  The only response was that by the fourth quarter profit com parisons should start to be m ade against the slowing econo my of late 2000, m aking otherwise dism al behavior look a little better. Their take on the prospects for substantial fis cal stim ulus was equally downbeat.  They viewed the current situation in Washington as political gridlock  and didn’t expect anything like the near-term fiscal stimulus shown in the Greenbook.  Monetary policy seem ed to them  to hold out the only hop e.  But they also seem ed to believe th at lower inte rest rates could do only so m uch to spur dem and on the part of consum ers who were eith er experiencing or feari ng layoffs or on the part of businesses faced with sizab le excess capacity, invento ries to work  off, and declinin g profits.   This overall assessm ent m ay be a bit gloom y for the nation as a whole.  Auto sales in particular su ggest th at co nsum ers have not gone into total hib ernation and  will react to  a good--or expenditures. Moreover, the stock market is upbeat , all things considered.  And I am  a bit m ore confident than the group about the prospect s for at least som e fiscal stim ulus.   11/6/01 32Their outlook, however, is com pletely consiste nt with everything we  know about the First District econom y.  We do not yet have any re gional em ploym ent data past Septem ber 11, but available indicators suggest that  New England’s econom y has declin ed recently, likely at a sharper pace than th at for the nation.  In part this is b ecause the slowdown in the region occu rred later th an that in the country as a whole and our area is to som e extent playi ng catch-up, but it al so reflects the growing impact of a fall-off in high-t ech equipment and software spending.   Both consum er and bus iness confidence about  the current econom y are off substantially, and non-m anufacturing respondents to recent busine ss surveys are now seei ng sales declines and have joined m anufacturers in a ne gative overall assessm ent of busine ss co nditions.  Initia l claims for unem ployment insurance rose sharply, and help -wanted advertising both in print and online deter iorated m arkedly as well.  Sales of existi ng hom es fell sharply in Septem ber and perm its for new hom ebuilding tren ded down through August.  Similarly, office vacancies were up substantially, to 8-1/2 percent in downtown Boston and to nearly  14 percent in the suburban m arkets.  These vacancy rates m ight not seem  high in an absolu te sens e, but, relatively, th ey are m ultiples of the rates prevailing a year ago and  repres ent a sea change in Boston real estate m arkets. Business conditions are not expected to ge t better any tim e soon.  Surveys of business confidence see no recovery until well into 2002. A University of Massachus etts leading indicator index points to declining econom ic activity in Mass achusetts for the next six m onths.  And the New England econom ic project, in whic h our Bank participates, forecasts a sharp drop in regional activity continuing into the first half of 2002 followed by very slow growth. On the national scene, the question no longe r seem s to be whether the econom y is in recession. The latest em ploym ent and durable go ods data seem to seal th at.  The questions now 11/6/01 33 focus on how deep and how long the turndown will be and what approp riate further policy actio n should be taken. We see a sim ilar trajectory in near-term  econo mic activity as the Greenbook, even with its latest revisions that take into accoun t last Fr iday’s unem ployment data.  Negative growth is expected to be re latively shor t-lived--th ree qu arters--even with that change in the employm ent picture, followed by a snapback induced by fiscal stim ulus, monetary ease, and a revival of inventory spending. If cyclical turns are a fact of life at  som e point, and I think they are, the Greenbook and many other forecasts as well suggest that this co ntraction m ight not be such a bad on e.  But uncertainties abound. The unem ploym ent report was unexpectedly negative.  Claim s data suggest that ano ther jum p in the unem ployment ra te may be a foregone conclusion.  And the drop in durable goods orders doesn’t bode well. My breakfast  group m ay be overly gloomy but the risks to consum ption and business spending that they discu ssed I thin k are real.  Corporate profits have deteriorated significantly and analys ts have been revising what had b een overly optim istic forecasts.  External sources of dem and don’t add m uch in what  now appears to be a global recession.  Fiscal stimulus m ay save the day, as the Greenbook suggests , but the possibilities for political gridlock are there, creating uncertainty both about the am ount of stim ulus and its tim ing.  State and local governm ent spending almost certain ly will contract in early 2002, as these bodies d ig in to rainy day funds and cut back spend ing in th e face of d ecreased revenu e. Monetary policy has eased aggressively and the stock m arket seem s to have le veled off. But other aspects of financial m arkets- -spreads and commercial bank cred it tightening--suggest financing conditions that m ay be tougher than the leve l of real sho rt-term  intere st rates im plies. That said, I keep argu ing with m yself about how to vi ew these undeniably downside risks in term s of t he stance of policy.  How low should rates go?  How fast should they get there?  And 11/6/01 34 how easy will it be to tig hten conditions when that is necess ary?  Much o f the data w e have on th e curren t econ omy continu e to refl ect the tragedy of Septem ber 11th. Confidence, consum er spending, and even business investm ent might begin to loo k bette r with  a littl e more tim e.  Further m onetary easing m ight help, but I think we also need to be car eful not to overreact.  I realize tha t inflation is not a current worry and that growth is now far below potential and will likely be so for som e time to come.  But policy easing has been particularly forcef ul to date.  And I confess to som e misgivings about rapidly approaching th e point where nom inal rates can no longer be reduced.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Econom ic activity in our District appears to have declined further in October, but perh aps a bit m ore moderately th an in the wee ks immediately after the Septem ber 11 attacks.  That pa rtly reflects the patter n of retail sa les, which dropped less sharply in Octobe r than in Septem ber, due m ainly to strong car sales in  our region--as elsewhere in the country--in  response to the zero percent financing packages. A couple of weeks ago Jerry Jordan, who appare ntly has been spying in my District, told me he had heard that a large a nnual boat show in Annapolis had su rprisingly strong results.  We checked it out, Jerry, and you were right. Sales we re quite robust.  But the reason given was that people want to enjoy them selves while they still can!  [Laughter ]  I don’t know whether that’s a good signal or a bad signal. Many of  the reta ilers we  talked to ov er the las t couple of  weeks in an a ttempt to get s ome sense of how they are approachi ng the holiday season, indicated that  they are quite nervous about it and accord ingly are bu ilding holid ay invento ries very cau tiously.  Elsewh ere in the District, residential hom e sales and construction are still gr owing, but much m ore slowly than a year or so ago. We no longer see the signs of a possible bo ttoming in m anufacturing activity that we thought 11/6/01 35 we m ight be seeing right before the terrorist at tacks.  In sum , with unem ploym ent rising, both households and business firm s in our region are generally nervous, and I would describe m any of them  as hunkering down. Turning to the national outlook, in short I thi nk it’s problem atic.  The staff, as we know, has m arked down fourth-quarter real GDP growt h to minus 3 percent at an annual rate.  And they see it rem aining negativ e until th e spring.   On the face of it, one co uld see that as a pess imistic forecast. But in m y view, as a number of other people have suggested, a strong case can be m ade that under the circum stances it is an optim istic forecast with a considerable am ount of downside risk.  I say that for three reasons. First, the Gr eenbook is projecting a loss of payr oll em ploym ent of about three-quarte rs of a million jobs  in the f ourth quarte r.  Of course, we got m ore than half  of that in Octobe r so the staff m ay already have revi sed that quarterly num ber, though I haven’t seen it.  In any case, we could get significantly greater job losses in this quarter.  Second, the G reenbook still projects that the unem ploym ent rate will peak at  around 6 percent or p erhaps a litt le higher.  That would be a cumulative increas e from the low point of a little m ore than 2 percentage points.  But in four of the five reces sions since 197 0 the cum ulative increas e in the un employm ent rate h as been som ewhere between 3 and 4 percentage points. Only in th e unusually brief and quite atypical 1980 recession was the cumulative rise lim ited to only about 2 per centage points.  Based on past experience, I think it’s reason able to exp ect that the 1-1 /2 percen tage point increase in unem ploym ent that has already occurred will weaken ho usehold con fidence further,  continue to depress spending growth, and cause still m ore job losses and so forth.  Third, the possi bility of higher than projected unem ploym ent in and of itself is not the only downs ide risk in this situation.  Historically, rising unem ploym ent in recessions h as been asso ciated w ith disinflation.  The Greenb ook is projecting som e disinflation th is time around, of course, but it is relatively m ild.  The slower growth in projected wages due to the 11/6/01 36 slack in the labor m arkets is accom panied by a s lowing in prod uctiv ity gro wth, so the d eclin e in unit labor costs is restrained by that.  But the disinflation could be m ore pronounced than projected.  For the last several decades, disinflation has been seen as a good thing and m any of us around this table have spent the better part of our Fed careers pr omoting it.  But it is a potential problem today.  My m ain point, and this has been alluded to al ready, is that in past recessions the Fed has had the leeway to cut the nom inal funds rate to ke ep the real f unds rate fr om rising as disinflation has run its course through these pe riods of weakness.  Today, we ha ve only 2-1/2 percentage points of leeway left before the nom inal funds rate h its the zero bou nd.  We will have to m atch any furth er disinflation with nom inal funds rate  cuts just to k eep policy at the sam e place.  But that’s going to eat up part of the leeway to cut the real funds rate, which we m ay need to do in order to counteract potentially serious weakness in the econom y.  I have a lways believed th at price stability is  the goal of monetary policy.  I still be lieve that. Often in the past I’ve argued for policy acti ons to preempt inflation as over tim e--over a couple of decades--we m oved the trend in flation rate do wn.  That was re ally the essence of o ur anti-inflationary strategy. And it has la rgely succeeded.  But in my view the risk to price stability is different today. What we need to do now is to preem pt disinflation--as novel as  it is to  think in tho se terms--and do so fairly aggressively to guard against the potential probl em of the zero bound I mentioned a m inute ago.  Of course, the core PCE inflation r ate, which is  the m easure I think m ost of us now focus on, is currently about 1-1/2 percent. I think that’s pretty clos e to the inflation target we should be aim ing for at this stage, for the reas ons I just noted.  And I believe we should focus our short-term  policy actions, as best we can, on preven ting that particular m easure of inflation from falling m uch below 1 percent.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Stern. 11/6/01 37

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  As ha s been the case for som e time, the District econom y is tracking closely with th e national econom y.  There are som e oases of strength but I don’t think th ey are particularly repres entative,  so I won’t spend a lot tim e on them .   Overall labo r market conditions h ave eased and la yoffs and initia l claims for unem ployment com pensation are up.  Office vacancy rates have begun to rise.  That was certainly anticipated. Vacancy rates for other commercial properties are al so ris ing and apartm ent vacancy rates are increasing as well. The exp ectation is th at that will feed back on activity as projects currently under construction wind down.  It has been a very strong year for single-family construction in the District but in that area, too, the outlook is less prom ising.  Sales, especially at the upper price end of the market, h ave slowed and I anticipate that the region  will have a lot of troub le next year duplicating the resident ial construction perform ance of the previous two or three years.   There has be en som e tightening in cre dit cond itions overall, bu t my impression f rom talking to a variety of people is  that decent quality cr edits can still be accomm odated on reasonab le terms.  So I don’t sense a huge am ount of tension or a problem there.   By way of a few m ore specific anecdotes, I talk ed to the lead ers of  a cou ple of nation al retailers. They described their bus iness over the last four or five weeks as okay relativ e to redu ced expectations. One cited sam e store sales as runni ng about 1 percent ahead of a year ago; that’s down, of course, from  what typically had been the cas e.  But reta ilers gen erally seem ed to think th at things could have been worse, perh aps significantly worse.  So that was their take on the situ ation. They also added that the discount  business was doing better than the full service departm ent store business, which is not particularly a surprise. I talked to executives of a couple of larg e paper com panies who also described their business as okay relative, of course , to subdued expectations.  That has been a business in which it 11/6/01 38 has been tough to m ake money for several years.  Those executives were quite cautious about capital spending going forward and didn’t put a lot of we ight on whatever program s Congress m ight gin up, but perhaps that view is specific to  their industry.  Finally, I talked to an official of a full service financial services firm  who said th at their sales of a wide variety of investm ent products have been quite robust recen tly. As far as the national econom y is concerned, I’m in gener al agreem ent with the con tours of the Greenbook forecast. I suspect that the contraction in the curr ent quarter m ay be a bit deeper than is projected in the Greenbook and it m ay take  an extra quarter before we see a recovery sometime next year.  Those are pretty m uch guesse s on m y part.  Talking to business people in the community, their views are along the sam e lines.  They expect business co nditions to g et worse before they get better and that th e recovery will occur late r rather than sooner.  But having said that, we do know that the econom y is very resilient even without the stim ulus in place or in prospect.  And, of course, we do have a lot of monetary stim ulus in place and it appears to m e that m ore fiscal stimulus is likely.  This resilience is som ething that I think we need to bear in m ind.  Its im plication, to me anywa y, is that we want to calibrate policy very carefully from  here on out so that we give ourselves at least a chance of winding up in  the right place for a sustainable period. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  On balance the Seventh District economy has slowed further since we m et in early October.  We’re in  an unpreceden ted situation  and uncertainty is very high. Many business firm s and households are essentially in a wait-and-see m ode regarding capital spending plans and consum ption e xpenditures.  Both businesses and consum ers are described by the people we ta lk to as hunkering down.   11/6/01 39The m ajor exception, as discussed b efore, is the recent su rge in light v ehicle sales.  They are rising in response to the zero percent financ ing program s far m ore than the autom akers had anticipated. Our Big Three con tacts expect sales to drop once these pr ogram s expire later this m onth but not as m uch as indicated in the Greenbook.  The sense we get from  autom akers and from  UAW contacts, given that labor costs ar e relatively fixed under their collectiv e bargaining contracts, is that various ince ntive p lans will con tinue to be of fered this y ear and next yea r to try to p revent light vehicle sales  from falling below an an nual ra te of 15 m illion u nits.  In the hard-hit travel and tourism  sector s, there are few sign s of any significant improve ment.  Airlines have cut fares and hotels ar e offering s pecial deals.   Airlin e load factors, however, are a bit m ore sensitive to developm ents in the war  on terro rism than the f are cu ts.  Our contact at  said th at after cutting capacity 20 percen t their load factors were good in the first week of October but plumm eted once the bombing in Afghanistan started, dropped m ore on news of anthrax cases, and fell again when governm ent officials issued warnings about additional terro rist threats. Our m anufacturing sector continues to bear the brunt of the Dist rict’s slowdown but econom ic weakness is spreading m ore rapidly into other sectors, especially  retailing.  Consum ers seem  more focused on fam ily and hom e, so sale s of hom e improvem ent item s are doing okay but sales of luxury item s are not.  One contact, with over 140 shopping m alls in 39 states, reported that mall traf fic returned to pr e-Septem ber 11th levels in m id-October, but consum er spending at the malls was still no ticeably lower than  prior to the a ttacks.  Retaile rs gene rally are bra cing for what they th ink could be the worst holid ay shopping seas on in a d ecade.  Many have canceled ord ers and refused delivery of goods in order to keep  their inventories under control.   11/6/01 40How consum er spending f ares in co ming mont hs will hin ge importantly on labor m arket conditions, which are deteriorating ra pidly.  The latest Manpower surv ey of hiring intentions for the first quarter of 2002 shows the largest year-ove r-year drop since 1980.  These results won’t be released publicly until Novem ber 21st, so they should be treated confidentially until then. Boeing is one of several firm s we know of that are pulling forward layoffs they had planned for later this year and 2002. Small businesses that last year were desp erately trying to retain workers are now reporting a dram atic drop in worker turnover.  Wage de mands of e mployees are abating. A special survey showed that 35 percent of firm s had reduced the size of planned salary increases s ince Septem ber 11th. However, a frequently m entioned concern is the double-digit incre ases in insuranc e premiums for em ployee health care. In our banking sector, reports on credit availabi lity are m ixed.  However, the risk of loss in C&I loan portfolios at sm all and large banks with significant exposure to m iddle m arket auto suppliers has increased dram atical ly as a resu lt of the f inancial dif ficultie s of these f irms.   Turning to the national outlook, it’s now quite cl ear that we are in a recession, as defined by the Natio nal Bureau o f Econom ic Research.  What is not clea r yet is h ow severe it will be.  The data in hand are still consistent with a relativ ely m ild downturn as in the Greenbook and our staff forecasts. But as I’ve already noted, business s entiment is very weak and I am  increas ingly concerned about the fragility of c onsum er sentim ent in this very unc ertain environm ent.  Given all I’ve heard from  contacts, we could be facing a wo rse downturn than the st aff anticipates and, of course, that assessm ent does not include any a dditional negative shocks from  further terrorist attacks. To be sure, there are some positives going forward.  We have put a lot of monetary stimulus in place and w e suspect that significant addi tional fiscal s timulus is com ing as well.  Also, 11/6/01 41 energy pr ices have f allen.  And once f inal dem and stabiliz es, we will get s ome big contribu tions from  inventory investment.  Indeed, when all th e positives align them selves som etime next year, we’ll have to be ready to adjust policy appropr iately.  For now though, the risks rem ain weighted toward econ omic weakness.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  The ne gative econom ic trends in our District that reappeared in the third quart er now extend into the fourth quart er.  Some sectors have continued to deterio rate as the risk s and uncertainti es directly attributable to September 11th play them selves out. In particular, tourism, rent al car activity, and airline traf fic, although now i mproving slightly, continue to be well below pre-att ack levels.  Airline flights are o ff 25 percent and planes are reported to be only 40 percent filled. Rental car com panies are “d efleeting” and als o have canceled new fleet purchase orders. Miam i’s cruise industry has been hurt by a large num ber of cancellations and Renaissance Cruise Line has file d for bankruptcy.  Hotel occupancy in Miam i is down; hotels whose bookings typically run at about 75 percent of capacity  are now at 45 percent. In Orlando, traffic at Disney facilities is running about  75 percent of norm al.  Disney reportedly has asked em ployees to volunteer for a 20 percent cut in hours and pay. In contrast, business at casi nos and hotels along the Mississippi Gulf Coast has com e back to about 90 percent of norm al levels.  The difference in the experience of the two areas appears to be due to the greater dependence on air travel for m ost of Florida’s cu stom ers. Turning to other sectors in the region, new and existing hom e sales appear to be slowing except for continued strong growth in South Florida.   Inventories of unsold homes are reported to be too high in Tennessee and in northw est Florida.  While the pace of single-fa mily construction remains only slightly below year-ag o levels, bot h multifam ily and nonres idential con struction hav e 11/6/01 42 weakened further. Merchants re port heavy discounting and are an ticipating a weak holiday s eason based on “early bird” shopping. While full service store sales are especially disappointing, discount chains like Wal-Mart and Target  are posting solid year-over-year  gains.  Auto sales dropped precipitously in the early fall but, as  others have pointed out, they picked up at the end of September in response to extended warranties and zero percent financing.  In Oc tober sales have been extrem ely strong and are arguably, as th e Greenbook points out, at unsusta inable levels.  Manufacturing continues to be weak and contacts note falling pr oductivity, as m ore res ources are diverted to heighten ed security.  More lum ber mills are cl osing and high- tech f irms are reduc ing p ayrolls further. After having been able to report job grow th bette r than the na tional ave rage in m eeting af ter meeting, we are now also feeling the em ploym ent pinch.  Only Florida act ually posted significant job growth in the third quarter. Prices rem ain subdued, though we hear continued reports of incre ases in liab ility and health insur ance prem iums. As far as the national economy is concerned, the data that have come out since our last meeting have not been very encouraging.  While th e reported third-quarter decline in real GDP of 0.4 percent could have been  a lot worse and may be revised lowe r, Friday’s negative jobs report makes it clear that the economy is headed toward wh at eventually will be defined as a recession.  That’s really a side issue.  Th e key question for policy, as others have already indicated, is how severe it will be both in depth and duration.  Comparing the curre nt situation with historical experience suggests to me that th ere are reasons to believe it w ill not be especially deep or prolonged. First, as almost ever yone has already observed, monetary policy has eased  steadily since the first of the year and is presently accommodative.  Second, significant government and private sector spending stimulus have been put in place with the recent tax cut, and more government spending programs are likely.  Security investment , rebuilding, and insuran ce payment flows are all 11/6/01 43 likely to bolster sp endin g.  Adm ittedly, thes e typ es of expenditures will n ot lead to productiv ity increases. I’m not especially worried about that  because of th e need to keep personal incom e moving up in the nea r term until business f ixed in vestm ent rec overs.  While the added spending will help, it is really a form  of stop-gap incom e maintenance.  Third, while th e econom y received a major shock on Septem ber 11th, the banking and financial sector s are sound and have proved largely resilient. Our exam iners tell us that banks c ontinue to lend prudently and that, while som e deter ioration in loan po rtfolios ha s occurred, the losses are not especia lly worrisom e at this po int.  Unlike the f inancia l situa tion in m ost previous e conom ic contractions, it’s hard to argue that financial sys tem weakness and reduc ed cred it ava ilability hav e contr ibuted or lik ely w ill contr ibute significan tly to the decline in econo mic activity. Monetary policy over the past year has done  what it is supposed to do and arguably virtually all of what it can do to  shore up the current outlook.  The more important policy question for the short term  is fiscal policy, th e impact of  which will d epend on how the f ederal tax and spending pr ogram s are actually struc tured.  Since a further ch ange in m onetary po licy will have little observable impact on Q4 perform ance, our focus should be on the projected path of the econom y over the next year and whether we believe that p ath is a chieva ble.  While the range of professional forecasts for the next two quarters is  quite wide, t hose forecasts are rem arkably cons istent and qu ite optim istic for the second half of 2002, as is th e Greenbook.  Our experim ents with som e of those models as well as with o ur own VAR m odel suggest th at add itional easin g at th is point is not lik ely to provide any m eaningful spending.  In som e ways, it m ight even hinder the adjustment proces s that still need s to work its way out in m any sectors of the econom y.  Addition ally, the Greenbook simulations of  alterna tive monetary polic ies suggest that with slack dem and and higher unem ployment addition al attem pts to cushion th e econom y will ultim ately be associated with a 11/6/01 44 further uptick in inflation. More over, to achieve any of these pa ths requires policy to be m ore nimble than in the past, in term s of raising the funds rate as the econom y begins to recover.   I must confe ss that it confuses  me at least a bit when Al Broaddus and Bob McTeer sw ap hats! [Laughter] Nevertheless, m y views toda y are probably closest to those expressed by Gary Stern. While we continu e to face con siderab le un certainty an d downside risks, I believe we have come to a point where f urther policy respons es should be more m easured.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, the econom y in the Tenth District  has not really deteriorated since our last m eeting, but that’s not saying m uch since it is considerably weaker than it was before the events of Septem ber 11th. Layoff announcem ents have subsided som ewhat but remain significantly higher than before the a ttacks.  The com position of the job cuts being announced also has shifted in the last m onth, w ith m ore now outside th e airline, aircraf t manufacturing, and travel industries in our region.  Distri ct manufacturing rem ains in a slum p but it does not appear significantly weaker  than last m onth.  Outside of autos, consum er spending has not recove red from the initia l fall after the attacks an d reta ilers in many areas are very m uch worried about the upcom ing holiday season.  The convention and hotel business has not returned to norm al either, due not only to continued con cerns about safety and travel dela ys but also to cost cutting by businesses under earnings pressure.  Housing activity has slowed in m uch of the District, especially in the high-end sector and particul arly in Kansas City and Denver. Those cities are also being hit with slowdowns associated with layoffs in the hi gh-tech s ector.  These lay offs also are increasing concerns ab out comm ercial real estate.  We see a lot of subleased space emptying out right now.  11/6/01 45 And though Realtors are prone to poin t out that it’s not nearly as bad as in the last recession, they are in fact worried. Let m e say a bit m ore on m anufacturing.  Preliminary results from  our Ba nk’s latest survey of manufacturers show that production was about as weak in Oct ober as it was in Septem ber.  Our firm s are more pessim istic about the future than  they were in the previous m onth.  For exam ple, the six-m onth-ahead production index was down about 6 points in the survey.  Among other forward-looking indicators, the ca pital spending index fell about 5 m ore points and the inventories of raw m aterials index also decline d.  So, looking forward, there is qui te a bit of pessim ism in the manufacturing sector.   Let m e mention the energy industry.  It has eased further since our last meeting.  The District’s rig count is now down ab out 25 percent from  the decreased le vel in July, as the steep fall in natural gas prices since the wi nter has rendered som e marginal we lls unprofitable. Spot prices have turned back, as you know, and we’re at about the 3.50 MCF level, which is  a level that at least will sus tain activ ity at about where it is now.   In agriculture, prices have dropped in the ca ttle industry, as you know, partly because of a drop-off in restaurant dem and after the Septem ber 11th attacks but also b ecause there is a large inventory in the feed lines. Crop prices also ha ve been weak, although ther e’s reason f or a little more optim ism there with storage lev els not as hi gh as they w ere a year ago.  Overall, business conditions in the District are generally poor. Turning to the national econom y, I would agree w ith those w ho say we are in a recession.  As for the outlook, while our forecast differs in some ways from  the Greenbook, I would say that in terms of the outcom e it’s a m atter of degree, not s ubstance.  In that context, though, I think it’s important to look at two tim e frames.  One is the imme diate future--that is, the fourth quarter--which 11/6/01 46 will be neg ative and will rem ain negative as we m ove toward the f irst quarter of next year.  The other is the interm ediate term --the f irst half  of next year and into the s econd half--where  the outlook is more optim istic in both the Greenbook and, as othe rs have said, in forecasts by private econom ists as well. That’s due im portantly to a very st imulative m onetary policy, fiscal policy that is stimulative and should be m ore stimulative as w e go forward, and to the f act that energy prices have fallen significantly. In term s of policy, I think we need to be very careful, as we always are, but our task is particularly difficult now. In that  context I’ll say just a couple things in summ ary.  Regardless of the funds rate, the fourth quarter will likely be negati ve and there’s nothing w e can do about that today.  With a significant am ount of stim ulus already in play, the econom y should r ecover in the first or second quarter of next year, and th ere’s probably not a whole lot we can do about the tim ing of tha t recovery at this stage. I would also p oint out that we tend to g et very nervous when we have taken actions and we’re not seeing a turnaround, and I think we  need to be very careful and patient in such periods. So, I can’t help wonder if we shouldn’t pause, knowing the dow nside risks are very serious as we look to the future, and watch events develop. Thank you.

MR. SANTOMERO. Thank you, Mr. Chai rman.  Overall underlying econom ic conditions in our District have worsened som ewhat since our m eeting five weeks ago.  While there has been a slight rebound from  the initial d ecline in activity w e saw after Septem ber 11th, the underlying trend still has a downward tilt and our contacts acknowledge a good deal of pessim ism regarding the rest of th e year.  The O ctober business outlook su rvey gave us our first data on the District since Septem ber 11th. Prior to the attacks , manufactur ing in our region appeared to be stabilizing. That is no longer th e case.  The index of current ac tivity took a sharp dow nturn in 11/6/01 47 faster pace than in prior months. Indeed, the inde x is now at levels we saw at the beginning of the year. There was a striking consistency across all the indic es.  New orders, shipm ents, and employm ent indices all fell sharpl y in October.  Manufacturers’ capital spending plans rem ained weak. In our October survey we asked som e special questions to try to ga uge the effects of the new orders. Half of the firm s reported that sh ipments were unaffected.  But 40 percent reported a troubling, since over 50 percent of the firm s reported a decrease in orders, suggesting that activity will con tinue to be weak  in the com ing m onths.  We also rep eated a qu estion f rom a previous month’s survey by asking firm s when they expect ed to see a turnaround.  The results indicate that many of the respondents are putting th e rebound further out into the future than they had in the past.  There was som e good news, however, in that 75 pe rcent of our respondents still expect to see a turnaround before the second half of next year. Other econo mic indicato rs for our District are weak.  Payroll em ploym ent in each of o ur three s tates declin ed in the third quarter and th e unem ploym ent rate increased.  It will likely go higher in su bsequent m onths, given the current p ace of layoffs.  Retail sales in th e Dis trict are running belo w last year’s pace.  Zero percen t financing has bo osted m otor vehicle sales in the region, as m any others have indicated for their D istrict s, but dealers expect sale s to decline later this year sin ce th e incen tives are pulling s ales forward  as well as generating new sales.  Indeed, dealers report to us that they are lim iting their orders from the factories. Retail sales of other goods and services hav e risen in recent weeks but have not regained the levels s een before the terrorist attac ks. 11/6/01 48Finally, con struction a ctivity in the District , one of our better-perform ing sectors during this downturn, has eased som ewhat.  Hom ebuilders in the District genera lly report steady dem and for new homes, with some softening in dem and for higher-priced hous ing.  Nonresidential construction activity has begun to fall off. On the natio nal lev el, the events of  Septem ber11th and their afterm ath have significantly weakened the near-term  outlook for the econom y.  Even before the attacks, the economy was m ore sluggish than m any of us had foreca sted earlier in the year.  The in itial estim ate shows a contraction in GDP growth in the th ird quarter, which is not a surprise.  And m ost forecas ts, in cluding our o wn, see a sharp contraction in the fourth quarter.  Typically the lo nger-run outlook is th e least certain, but these days most econom ists feel more certain a bout the long-run prospects for the econom y tha n the medium -term.  Assum ing no further shocks, we s ee a pickup in activity ne xt year, driven by the aggressive monetary and fiscal s timulus.  The difficulty, of course, is determ ining when this pickup will occu r and whether f urther m onetary s timulus will he lp to ensure a b etter outcom e.   My outlook is sim ilar to the Greenbook’s, although rebounds have b een much stronger historically than the one we ar e now forecasting.  In addition, a Ph iladelph ia staff analysis suggests that forecasters typically underpredict the respons e of output growth to expansionary m onetary policy. Nonetheless, the incom ing data certainly poi nt to continued econom ic weakness in the near term and one could easily argue that the current period represents a break with past history.  The continue to struggle. Labor m arket indicato rs point to accelerated job loss es.  The sizable drop in consum er confidence suggests continued weakness in consum er spending.  The surge in October auto sales drew sales from the future, so vehicl e sales are likely to fall in future m onths.  11/6/01 49 Nevertheless, the auto sales data i llustrate the stimulative effect of interest ra te declines even in times of increased uncertainty and unease.   So where does this all leave us?   In respons e to the devastating events of Septem ber 11th, the Comm ittee’s f ocus a ppropria tely turned to the imm ediate term  and we acted swiftly and significantly. The fed funds ra te is now 100 basis points lowe r than it was on September 10th. Two months have now passed since the attack.  I certainly do not want  to underestim ate the am ount of weakness we are seeing in the economy and that we expect to see in the com ing m onths.  I’m sufficiently unsure abou t the tim ing and streng th of the forecasted recovery, even giv en the s izable monetary stimulus already applied to the economy, that I w ould support som e further easing action.  However, it seem s incumbent upon us to begin to  shift our focus back to the m edium and longer term .  In so doing, we would acknowledge th at a significant am ount of m onetary and fiscal policy stim ulus has been applied to the econom y.  By alm ost every m easure, m onetary policy is quite accommodative and there is more fiscal stimulus on the way.  Focusing on the mediu m and longer term  would help us prepare the m arkets and the public for the time when the Comm ittee fiscal policy. It would give us m ore flexibility  going forward as we gather additional data on the econom y’s current condition and its trajectory.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I want to comm ent on a few of the highlights from  conversations I’ve had with business contac ts.  The extent of the weakness in the U.S. econom y and its im pact on Asia I th ink was well illu strated b y my UPS c ontact who s aid that his firm’s volum e outbound from  Asia has been running only one-half of what U PS had anticipated.  Of course, th at’s because ex pectations w ere for a lo t of high-tech equipm ent to be shipped  here and th at 11/6/01 50 has not happened. The UPS outlook is that next y ear will be better than this year and they are anticipating about a 2-1/2 percent growth in volum e.  Volume this  year is running about 10 percent below last year. UPS, along with m any others, is  cutting capital spending.  The firm  expects to reduce capital expend itures by $500 m illion out of a budget that would otherwise hav e been $2-1 /2 billion, so the cutback is about 20 percent.            My FedEx contact said that in his discussions with custom ers their belief is that business is going to be flat to the end of  this year and on into 2002.  FedEx sees flatness but not substantial weakness from  here.  The firm  finds that since the end of Septem ber volum e has been very steady and predictable, though obviously not strong. My contact at J.B. Hunt, which is a very larg e trucking firm , says that custom ers are rather pessim istic.  Business this Octobe r was about flat com pared with last October; the company had anticipated growth of 10 to 15 perc ent.  The m arket for used  large trucks has collapsed.  My contact described it as a disast er and he is expecting a lot of bankr uptcies in the trucking industry.   I would lik e to f inish on a sligh tly po sitive note in term s of reports f rom my contacts,  so I will m ention that W al-Mart, as o thers have noted, is  doing r ather well.  Wal-Ma rt sales for the f ive weeks ended October 5th, which includes the imm ediate and s ubsequent post-attack period, were up 6.3 percent. The com pany’s expectation had been 4 to  6 percent, so total sa les over that period were actually a b it strong er than had been anticipated.  Moreover, Wal-Mart is not cutting its capital expenditu re plans at all and in fact has revis ed up slightly its forecas t for n ext year from the expectations held before Septem ber 11th. I want to m ake a comm ent on fiscal policy.  The tem porary investm ent incentiv es that are being discussed are really very treacherous. Policy actions are being cons idered and y et the b est experts in th e world don’t know how to forecast what the outcom e is going to be.  That says to m e 11/6/01 51 that it’ s a ve ry tre acherous policy ins trument.  There is a lo t of experience  with tem porary investm ent credits of various sorts over the years and I think the experience is not very favorable.  Sitting where we are tod ay it m ight look as if an investm ent credit is go ing to be a pos itive for the immediate future, but I think it’s going to involve a high probability of som e greater difficulty later.  If the economy were to rebound strongly, we would see great efforts to br ing capital expenditures forward into the tem porary window.  That would m ake the econom y even stronger.  Moreover, it would raise a lot of problem s in interpreting the incom ing data and trying to anticipate how m uch funda mental strength really exists  in the econom y.  If the econom y remains weaker than anticipated, we’re going to see proposals to extend the tem porary provision but we won’t know whether it will be extended or not. In my view, our history of temporar y fiscal policy adjustm ents is not a good one and I think they are going to cause  trouble rather than provide any a ssistance to the econom y.  That’s all I want to say at this point. Thank you.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Mr. Chairm an, the Se cond District’s econom y has deteriorated further since the last  report, but it is very unclear how  much of the weakening can be tied to the te rrorist attacks and how much would have happened in any event.  Widespread transportation disruptions that developed imm ediately after th e attacks eased substan tially in resto red.  Our big prob lem is gettin g people fro m New Jersey to lower Manhattan.  About 55 percent of the people who commute into lower Manhattan co me from New Jersey and an av erage commute 11/6/01 52 time that was an hour and a half is now two-and- a-half hours.  Efforts are under way to get m ore ferries and other rerouting of th e rail and subway lines, but that  continues to be a difficulty. Businesses most clearly  affected by the dis aster include retailers, hot els, and other travel- related firms.  Retailers n ote tha t sales in October  remained well be low plan at Manh attan s tores.  That m ainly ref lects f ewer tour ists, especia lly in ternational tourists who spend substantially m ore than residents of New York or tourists from elsewhere in the United States.  Manhattan hotels experienced their worst S eptem ber on record.  Business reportedly rebounded m oderately in The im pact on the local labor m arket is not  yet clear.  An estim ated 75,000 additional jobless claim s, well above trend, we re filed in New York and northern N ew Jersey in the five weeks after the attacks. Commercial r eal es tate m arkets in Manha ttan and the suburbs have not tightened as expected since the attacks. What seem s to be the cas e, des pite the enorm ous loss of office space, is that firm s were hoard ing office space during the boom  years and they have discov ered th ey can now give it up. Citico rp, for exam ple, had about 400,000 square feet earm arked for further expansion that it was able to m ake available to L ehman Brothers with really no burden to itself.  The further expansion is now  less likely, so Lehm an Br others wo n and Citico rp won.  In general the view seem s to be that relocation--m ost firm s are act ually going to m idtown M anhattan--can be achieved without m uch additional building.  That puts an another question m ark on “ Whither lower Manhattan?” In that regard I’ll m ention an intere sting side note.  Last F riday Governor Pataki which in som e ways considers itself  part of the business com munity--that he was creating a corporation for the restructure of lower Manhattan.  The m embers of that group I believe will be named later this week.  That’s a v ery positiv e developm ent because there  has been a real ques tion 11/6/01 53 about who is in charge. The answ er is that nobody has been in char ge and therefore the degree of uncertainty hovering over Ground Zero as it’s now called and neighboring lower Manhattan has been greater than it should have been. Not surprisingly, because of the downturn in the financial services industry, Manhattan apartm ent sa les ac tivity has been ve ry thin.  It’s hard to gauge exactly where the p rices are but they are probably down 10 to 15 percent,  with very f ew deals ac tually taking place.  Bankers report weaker loan dem and, tighter credit standards, and increased delinquencies.  The residential m ortgage segm ent appears to be faring relatively well.   On the national level, we shar e the view about the general shape of recovery that the Greenbook describes and that Dave Stockton presented so well.  On the international side, I’m inclined to b elieve that Karen’s forecast is accu rate, but op timistic, and th at the downside there is probably even greater than  it is domestically.   Regarding consum er confidence, the fact is that housing has held up rather well.  And certainly the  pace of autom obile sale s in October,  at 21 m illion units, in dicates that p eople want to buy cars. It’s nice to have zero percent fina ncing, but presum ably people don’t purchase an autom obile even with no financing costs unless they want o ne in the f irst plac e.  So I think there are indications that consum er confiden ce is holding up better than we might have anticipated.  How long it will hold up at this level is  a very big question, as m any of us have discussed.   Business fix ed investm ent is abno rmally lo w even for a recession.  There m ay well be enough of it waiting on the sidelines th at fiscal p olicy d irected at increas ing investm ent will work .  But in m y view there are som e very legitim ate ques tions about whether that wi ll be the case.  In any event, partis an politics are alive a nd well.  They did not go away exce pt for a very b rief respite after 11/6/01 54 the 11th of Septem ber.  So I think there is a real questi on of when and if the fis cal policy that is being discussed will happen. We believe that the dow nside risk is very clear  and quite dism al.  That is a view that is shared fully by the m embers of our board of directors and by those on our Sm all Business and Agriculture Advisory Comm ittee.  It is also the view of everybody that I and m y colleagues at the New York Bank talk ed to in try ing to ascer tain what is happening in our District as well as nationally and internatio nally.  So I believ e our forecast is th e best forecast that can b e made unde r the circum stances but it is one where the downsid e risk  is very clear and the ro le of monetary policy continues to be a vitally important one.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Jordan.

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Listening to everyone who has spoken so far leads m e to feel that it’s not m uch easier today than it was five weeks ago to know what to m ake of either the econom ic repo rts or the anecdotal inform ation available to u s.  I com e to each of these meetings hoping there will b e less uncertainty than the last tim e--and last tim e was uncertain enough--but that doesn’t seem  to have b een the case today based on our go-around. About 150 years ago a clever econom ist made a reputation f or him self by talking about the unseen versus the seen. He had a lot of fun ta lking about those things that were not so obvious, but rather important to think about.   Of course, that concept wasn’t  new with him . It was in the works of Copernicus and Ptolem y also.  Nevertheless, what people are not doing at all or are doing less of is not news to any of us. However, what th ey are doing instead--if we can find out what it is-- is of interest and m ight give us som e clues.  For instance, b ased on a lead from  one of our directors we found that ticket sales for the Ringling Brothers Barnum  and Baile y Circus in the last two weeks of October at Cleveland’s Gund Arena were 10 percen t higher than a year ago.  So apparently people  11/6/01 55 are doing som ething for the fam ily, which seems to be  consistent with other things we’ve heard.  In fact, both a m ember of our adviso ry council and one of our directors reported that the com position of consum ption spending that they have been seeing is  consistent with the noti on of a cocooning effect.  A couple of rem arks by previous speakers support that notion--for instance, the spending on hom e improve ments and durable goods for one’s hom e.  I don’t know whether the car sales phenom enon goes with that too or not. A com pany that produces security glass for both businesses and resi dences reported that they were already having a very strong year and th ey experienced a sharp increase in orders after backlogs are lengthening. Also, the health-care sector has generally booste d capital spending since prim arily f or emergency room  facilities. As for the retail sector, we stay in contact  with Federated depart ment stores and they reported that their October sales were down year- over-y ear b ut the declin e was consid erably sm aller than they ex perien ced in  Septem ber and m uch le ss than they had expected based on what happened immediately after September 11th. Their thinking now, looking ahead to this quarter, is that they will f inish th e year down  6 percen t from the f ourth quarte r of last y ear.  They’ve r evised down their expectations for the spring to a 2 per cent dec line, year-ov er-year, which is  a sm aller de cline than they were thinking a few weeks ago. And for the s econd half of next year they have projected a 6 percen t increase yea r-over-year.  Our conta cts at both Kohls and Federated told us that they now expect stronger year-end gift gi ving sales than they had previousl y.  They analyzed the com position of sales over Halloween and now belie ve the desire to give gifts is much stronger than before, which 11/6/01 56Tying in with som e of the rem arks made ear lier about the uncertainty  regarding what is going on with auto sales, auto dealers in our District  think th at sales will f all very quickly.  They said their strategy is not to have any inventory on Decem ber 31st. One director, continuing in the good news vein, said that Bob Evans, Applebee’s, and Ruby Tuesday’s all had the strongest Septem ber in their history, which is consistent  with people driving to  places instead of fl ying to Florida, for exam ple.  The bad news side of that is  that auto accidents are probably up!   One of the sources we’v e been look ing at is a co mpany called Telecheck,  which has 270,000 outlets across the country that report on purchases by checks.  The data are analyzed now  by a former                                                It’s a rather interesting report.  Sales in N ew York City, which is a big m arket and heavily weighted, were  down 5 percent October over October.  Overall sales in New York State were down about 1 percent.  Those were th e only declines recorded in the survey either by m etropolitan area or on the state level.  The Southeast w as the strongest region, led by Louisiana and by New Orleans in particular.  Maybe it’s those casinos!  One of the strongest states in the survey was Ohio, wh ere sales increases were well above  those in California.  And the metropolitan  area of Cleveland was s econd only in stre ngth to New Orleans.  So we’re not quite up there at the top, but we’re pretty close. Eleven years ago at this tim e, looking ahead to  Desert S torm and in the m idst of Desert Shield, it seem ed that both businesses and households  went into a m ode of postpone the postponable.  The attitude was: “Don’t do it now if you don’t have  to; wait and see what is going to happen.”  We met with quite a few groups in recent weeks, including our directors, advisory councils, and the senior credit officers of all the la rge b anks in th e District, and  asked them  whether th ey see a sim ilar response today. Confirming what we’re seeing in the num bers, the answer was “yes” for businesses but “no” for households. How does one  explain that to a large extent  the business sector, especially  11/6/01 57 manufacturing com panies, seem s to have gone into a postpone and wait-and-see m ode while households have not?   Generally, the initial response am ong our c ontacts was:  “Apparently m y spouse doesn’t read the sam e things I do!”  But upon further discussion they sa id no, in fact it’s the opposite. The spouse usually says:  “Haven’t you read about unem ployment and the bad economy? It’s our duty to go out and spend.” Apparently  businesses don’t think th e sam e way.      In our m eeting last week with senior credit officers I ask ed them to imagine that a year ago, when m aking their budget plans for 2001, they ha d accurately forecast the econom ic situation of today in term s of broa d measures of output, empl oyment, and so on.  With an accurate forecast of the m acro econom y I wondered what they would have expected with regard to  their consum er loan portfolio. They said they would have projected a substantially worse outcom e.  They would have assum ed a very negative hit to the consum er portf olio, but that has not happened.  Asked why, they suggested th at the refinancing boom  might be a f actor, with the length ening of m aturities and, of course, lower interest rates. One banker comm ented that his bank’s m ortgage departm ent is buried.  The general view is that househol d debt service burdens are actually lower now than they were a year ago. If that could be confir med, I would think that’s pretty good news.  They also reported that their comm ercial real estate portf olios were in much better shape than they would have thought; in fact they des cribed them  as excellen t, which is quite different from  the experience 10 or 11 years ago. I asked about car loans, expect ing that there weren’t any.  But they said car loans are in fact still increasing. I had forgotten about im ports and transplants, su ch as Honda, which did not offer zero percent financing. Honda didn’t go that rou te because it doesn’t like it and think s it’s a m istake. Toyota and in fact m any of the Daim lerChrysler models were not include d in the zero percent financing deals either. And Jeep, for instance, is producing a Toledo m odel for which they can’t keep up with the dem and.  Moreover, the loan o fficers m ade a point that  is obvious, but I hadn’t 11/6/01 58 thought about it: With every new car sale, a used car sale almost always occurs too, and the banks often finance those purchases. Let m e make som e general comm ents on econom ic policy actions and the perform ance of the m acro econom y.  It seem s to m e that a pr escription for policy should be derived from a diagnosis. We never see all regi ons, sectors, and i ndustries of the economy  moving up or m oving down together. There have been tim es in past history when we’ve seen weakness in s ectors lik e housing and autos. Those situations often warrant  a prescription of easier monetary policy; lower financing rates m ay see m appropriate.  When I look at the fiscal policy under  consideration today- -and having listened to the staff th is morning regarding the uncertainti es about it--it’s  very hard to understand what m ight be going on, in the way of econom ic thinking at leas t.  I don’t know how what is being proposed or considered by the Congre ss is going to help any of the problem s that we actually see now in the econom y.  It’s easy to understand the need for separation of powers in the branches of governm ent.  And it’s easy to understa nd that m embers of Congre ss want to raise their hands and vote for som ething.  They want to be pe rceived as being a part of the solution.  But it’s not at all clear to m e that anything that is being proposed under the banner of fiscal action is going to be on balance constructive. That assessm ent m ay be derived from  my general bias in that I’ve always been  skeptical ab out the thrus t of fiscal po licy a ctions.  But I could easily ta lk myself  into believ ing th at the fis cal action s currently under consideratio n will do m ore harm  than good. On m onetary policy I distinguish between the le vel of the fed funds rate and the reactions associated w ith announcem ents of changing it.  The le vel, of course, is im portant because we need to know where the funds rate stands re lative to some perception of the na tural rate.  That’s crucial in assessing whether we are injecting a sufficien t amount of liquidity for the m acroeconom ic circum stances to achieve the outcom e we want.  That’s one issue.  I look  at where we are and 11/6/01 59 evalua te oth er information to te ll me whether I th ink the f unds rate leve l is appropriate or not.  That’s qu ite different from the issue of announcem ents of the  Comm ittee’s decis ions to change the rate, which show up in the headline news. When I engage in the debate between “keep the powder dry” versus “take preemptive action,” I think in  term s of how m any m ore announcem ents we m ight want to be able to m ake.  That would lead m e to suggest one-eighth of a point changes in the funds rate as m ore appropriate at th is juncture becau se then we would captu re more head lines.  But that h as nothing to do with whether I believe  the current stance of policy is su fficiently stim ulative or not.   Finally, m y thinking is that over tim e the Co mmittee should look at the b alance of ris ks, not in term s of the statem ent that we put in ou r announcem ents, but in the sense of what kinds of mistakes are we m ore willing to m ake and how can  we correct them .  We know that mistak es are inevitable, b ut we need to assess which m istakes are m ore harmful or m ore difficult to correct.  There was a tim e when we thought the greater risk was for policy to rem ain stim ulative for too long because hav ing to tighten dram atically would be di fficult.  So we thought it would be better to err on the sid e of restraint b ecause we could always ease m ore readily.  I now perceive, at least based on some of the comments m ade around the table, that the balance of risks is reversed.  And that m ay be correct and appropriate. Now the view  generally is that the risk of be ing too res trictive is th e gre ater mistake, especially look ing at the ex perien ce of  Japan and theoretical worries in som e other countries, resulting in either deflat ion or prolonged contractio n.  So the th ought is that it’s b etter to err on the side of m ore stim ulus.  While that m ay be correct, I th ink we should be saying, at least among ours elves if we don’t want to go public with it, that we are m ore tolerant of running the risk of re-inflation than we were before.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 11/6/01 60

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Our decision today, as Jerry Jordan has just ind icated, com es at a tim e of great uncertainty.  I think our chal lenge is to m inimize the risk facing our econom y in these uncertain tim es.  As we  have already indicated  around the table, there are som e positiv e sign s that can ’t be overlooked.  Certainly the streng th in light v ehicle sales is attributable to incentives to som e extent, but there are those who believe  that it’s m ore than that and financial m arkets, pa rticularly the eq uity m arkets and the futu res m arkets--and perh aps even the level of the U.S. dollar--attest to a market e xpectation of a rapid rebound.  And finally, as has already been discussed, monetary stimulus is in th e pipeline and fiscal pol icy may well become more accomm odative.   However, buried within these potentially pos itive signs are som e negative ones, and we have already talked about those to  som e extent.  The current stre ngth in auto sales is probably borrowing from  future dem and and we can expect de mand for autos to fall off.  There is the possibility that the process of finding a fiscal st imulus package that works for all will produce fiscal action that is  too little, to o com plex, and too la te.  And finally, the strengt h in equity m arkets m ay well erode quite rapidly and we c ould have a negative wealth effect  as earnings fail to m eet the expectations that are built in to equity m arket prices.   Against the background in which m uch of the good news in the near term  is potentially bad, certainly there’s a lot of ot her negative news as well.  Labor m arket weakness is spreading beyond m anufacturing to other sectors.  With the specter of growing unemploym ent likely to weigh more heavily on consumers, weakne ss in the labor m arket will m ean, I think, sm aller increases in wages and salaries going forward, potentially un derm ining consum ption as a m ajor driver of macroeconom ic strength this year and next year.  While the housing m arket appears to be robust, 11/6/01 61 there is som e anecdotal evidence from building m aterials firm s that suggests som e weakening in the construction segm ent.  One of our contacts noted  that for the first tim e since late 1991 several construction  firm s plan to close dow n between T hanksgiving  and Christm as because of insufficient order backlogs. Again that’s a sm all sign of som e uncertainty in an area that has been strong for some time. More recent data on durable goods orders sugge st that com panies are hoarding liquidity and m ore firm s than had been expected are hold ing off on putting new fixed investm ents in place.  Participan ts in the bond m arket tell u s that even  the reco rd-setting bond is suance, which could be seen as an in dicato r of business confidence, is b etter interpreted as ind icating that the f ree cash flow for fir ms is insufficient to cover even existing in vestm ent activities m uch less support new ones.  And finally, as I think Dave Stoc kton m entioned, survey indicators show that m anufacturing is clearly contracting and I gather  that our own IP num bers m ay well support that conclusion.   We haven’t put very m uch weight on the in ternational outlook, t hough I would agree with Vice Chairm an McDonough that K aren’s forecast s eems to be the m ost reasonable one given the facts we know now but that the ri sks internationally cer tainly are very m uch to downside.  And insofar as commodity prices tend to suggest the relative balanc e of supply and dem and in global The question is how to guide policy with th is confluence of deve lopm ents.  Recognizing the risk that we m ight do too m uch, I would still e rr on the side of continuing to be aggressive, which I think speaks directly to the poi nt Jerry Jordan was just m aking.  The best strategy when confronted with an ongoing deterioration is to  move to offs et the worst downsid e risk and prepare to respond to the upside in the unlikely event that we’re surprise d in that direction.   11/6/01 62While it is tr ue that m onetary po licy in the p ipeline is a lready  stim ulative,  it’s im portant to recognize th at we put th at policy in place ag ainst a pa rticular background  of a forecast and outloo k at the tim e and, if anything, the out look has continued to erode.  Accord ingly, I think that does require ongoing policy response. The one m istake that a centr al bank can m ake when confronted with the type of erosion that we are facing, w hich m ay ind eed include the risk of disinflation, is to m ove sluggish ly in increm ents that are to o sm all out of fear of hitting th e zero  bound too quickly.  That cautiou s strategy is the most risky because it leaves open the possibili ty of a m uch weaker s ituation still in the c ontext of  little  room  for policy m aneuver.   So, while Bob McTeer encouraged us to remember the Alamo, I would suggest that perhaps th e experiences of the Bank of Japan and others m ight be im portant to rem ember as well.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  An important them e at our last m eeting was uncertainty. We were m eeting reasonably close to September 11th and it was still hard to so rt out the data. It’s easier to do the sorting now. To paraphrase Murphy’s L aw, alm ost everything that could go down, did. It’s pretty hard to fi nd sources of strength in today’s econom y.   The list of downward-pointing indicators is long and getting longer:  the Beige Book, employm ent, the NAPM survey, durable goods orde rs, consum er confide nce, industrial production, commodity prices, foreign dem and growth, and on down the list.  What seem s especially troublesom e is that former sources of spendi ng growth are beginning to w eaken.  Housing expenditures are beginning to slip and consum ption is starting to fall relative to dispo sable income.  As Governor Ferguson just noted, au to sales spurted but that could imply weakness ahead if the sales just reflect an imm ediate bunching of  expenditures in response to th e zero interest rate deals.   11/6/01 63The stock market is surprisi ngly high, but that could be problematic as well.  The earnings-price ratio is now virtually the same as  the real AAA bond yield and this with analysts’ earnings forecasts that are still implausibly optim istic.  When and if more prudence strikes the earnings forecasters, or if more normal risk spread s assert themselves, stock values could fall as well. Many commentators are now arguing that be cause all of  this has happened as interest rates were cut, m onetary po licy m ust be impotent.  Perhaps I’m  preaching to the choir h ere, but sin ce I think it’s relevant for our decision, let m e spend a m inute taking on that argum ent.  To be sure, monetary policy has been fighting very powerful dow nward forces this year, far m ore powerful than I think any of us i magined at the start of the y ear.  Policy easings m ay not have had the curative effects that we had all hoped for, but I think the impotence argum ent takes things m uch too far.  The essence of monetary policy is th rough the in terest rate-cost o f capital cha nnel.  In the Goldm an Sachs financial conditions index this interest rate  channel gets 90 percent of the weighting.  In the FRB/US model its weighting range s from  76 percent to 90 percent, depending on whether one takes one-quarter im pacts or long-run im pacts.  And that  channe l has worked well this ye ar.  Short ra tes obviously have dropped sharply. Even longer-term , 10-year Treasury rates have com e down from 4 to 3 perc ent in rea l terms since th e start of their easing cycle last ye ar and from  6 to 4-1/2 percent in nominal term s.  These changes have held up final spending.  This year the easing of monetary policy clearly seems to have held up spending for housing and consum er durables, especially autos.  It’s possible that it has even had som e positiv e effect on investm ent, though it’s obvious ly hard to m ake that case given the powerful downw ard im pact of the capital overhang. I will agree with the c ritics th at there are both the oretical and em pirical qu estions abou t some of the other ways that m onetary policy alle gedly stim ulates the eco nomy.  One suspect ch annel 11/6/01 64 involves the foreign sector. It seems that a d rop in interest rates doesn’t n ecessarily lo wer dom estic curren cy values, perhaps because it raises exp ected profits or perhaps because conditions m ight have becom e even weaker in other econo mies.  The other suspect channel involv es the wealth ef fect.  There seem s to be no doubt that a rise in future productivity will ra ise equity values and consu mption, as p eople try to consum e som e of their future anticipated incom e up front.  But whether f alling inte rest rates and rising  relative house prices, which do raise com puted net worth, s hould also raise consump tion has always been a matter of som e theoretical am biguity.   So m onetary policy is perhaps not as potent as  som e believe, but it still can have powerful impacts, still can be used to fight downward m ovements, and still has b een ef fective in m aintaining spending th is year.  In the face of the powerful downward m omentum  that se ems to com e with each day’s econom ic news, I think we have no choice but  to use our instrum ent as em phatically as we can. Finally, let m e say one word about reversib ility, som ething about which I am  not very worried. Much of the Greenbook recovery hinges on additional fiscal stimulus, which is som ewhat in doubt for political reasons and is perhaps ev en econom ically treach erous.  It’s not so m uch of a stretch to sa y that the world re covery hinges on the U.S. recover y, which hinges on fiscal policy, which hinges on politics. That is an exaggeration, I adm it, but not too m uch.  It’s easy for m e to imagine a very slow recovery here and in the world and that should give us pl enty of tim e to reverse course. But if  condition s are such tha t we have to revers e more quickly, th at would ac tually be fantastic news and we should be delighted to do that.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 11/6/01 65

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Relative to the cu rrent Greenb ook forecast, I believ e that there are s till asymm etric downside r isks to the first half of next  year but that the risks are m ore balanced after that tim e.  Because of th e near-term  downside risk s, I view the  alternative scenario of still weaker  consum er spending as identifying a ma terial risk.  Give n that risk and considerations that, in my view, s uggest that policy today should be se t to err on the side of stim ulus, the path of the federal fu nds rate in my forecast is more consisten t with the easier m onetary po licy alternative sim ulation.  Indeed, that would be th e case even if I were beginning with the Greenbook baseline. Still, as David Stockton noted in his p resentation, th ere is an unu sual blend o f pessim ism and grim  data on the one hand and signs of resi lience on the other hand, further com plicating the assessm ent of the outlook.   But m y major conce rn relates to the question of the appropriate m onetary policy rela tive to the forecast. My first concern here is that m onetary policy m ay be less effective in this e asing cycle than it norm ally has been becau se of the failure of the declines in sho rt-term interest rates to pass through  to other dim ensions of financial co nditions that m atter m ore for spendin g.  In that regard I recognize that my  views run counter to the rem arks we  just heard and to m any of the comments around the table this m orning that have  emphasized the am ount of m onetary stim ulus already in the pipeline and its  likely contribution to the vi gor of the projected rebound.   Financial conditions indices, including the one  recently constructed by the Board’s staff, are som etimes subject to  difficulties in interpretation.  But they do in my view highligh t the risk that financial conditions have im proved much less th an would have been expected based on the magnitude of the cum ulative declin e in the federal funds rate over this easing cycle.  The Greenbook forecast p resum ably takes this into account.  Indeed, I suspect it m ay be the reason wh y monetary policy is assum ed to remain so stim ulative, m easured  in term s of the real f unds rate relative to its 11/6/01 66 long-term  equilib rium  value and relative to th e econom y’s rebound.  The im plication of concerns about the improvem ent in financial conditions is not  that we s hould rely less on m onetary policy b ut that we m ay have to do more than would otherwise have been necessary. Second, I wonder whether we need to take into account another aspect of asymm etric risk --what m ight be described as the two-states-o f-the-world problem .  The Greenbook, like m ost forecasts, s eems to assum e a one-tim e terroris t attack with a near-term  effect on confidence that dissipates o ver tim e.  That m ight be appropriate  for a m odal forecast.  But relative to this assum ption, there seem s to be signif icant asymmetric downside risks, sp ecifically of further terrorist attacks that affect confidence in the econom y or perhaps for other reasons as well.  The forecast for the first state of the world is therefore likely to be  biased in an optim istic direction though, as David Stockton noted, we would be hard pressed to para meterize th e downside risks asso ciated with the second state of the world. Still this analysis s uggests that the m ean of  the forecast m ight be interpreted as being below the m ode in this case.  So the questi on is how policy should respond to this type of uncertainty and whether policy should be se t to e rr on the sid e of ease re lative to the modal forecast. This concern is reinforced by the im plicati ons of  the zero nom inal bound restraint.  My remarks here will elaborate on th e points th at have already b een m ade by Presiden t Broaddus and Governor Ferguson. Some have suggested that  the initially low nom inal funds rate should encourage us to keep our powder dry. To the cont rary, I read the lesson from  our study of the zero nominal bound constraint as pointing to an asym metric policy response, one that is more rapid with respect to downside shocks. This allows polic ymakers to use a faster sp eed of respo nse and compensate f or the sm aller possib le cumulative d eclin e.  The result of the more aggressive policy would be to lim it further declin es in core PCE inflation, restraining it from  falling belo w my long -11/6/01 67 run target of  1-1/2 percent as it does in the Gree nbook baseline.  This m aintains a cushion that would allow a larger decline in the real federal funds rate if needed. This m ay be less of a pressing concern at th e moment given the steepness in the yield curve and the opportunity for long rates to fall relativ e to short rates if the dow nturn is deeper or the recovery m ore gradual or longer delayed than no w expected.  A more rapid easing would, however, provide an opportunity for long-term  rates to fa ll by m ore over the forecast horizon if the sharpness of the decline or the m oderation of  the recovery disappoints the fina ncial m arkets.  In any case, I take the lessons from  the zero nom inal bound anal ysis to m ean we probably should m ove m ore aggressively in response to advers e shocks, not less when nom inal s hort-term  rates are already low. My last concern is about long-term  rates.  While they have declined som ewhat further recen tly, th ey have been sticky in re lation to the cum ulative declin e in sh ort-term  rates.  As a resu lt, I have become concerned that we m ay have lost the ability to lower them  further with monetary policy and, therefore, have quite lim ited leverage on aggregate dem and.  This stickiness m ay reflect in part, as David Sto ckton noted,  the offsettin g effect of a revis ion in longer-term  budget pros pects.  But in my view, it m ay also reflect a diverg ence betwee n the FOMC’s forecast for the economy and the forecast im plicit in the b ond market, equity m arkets,  and the federal funds futures m arket.  Given the more robust forecast app arently priced into th ese markets--m ost evid ent in  the expectation of an early and aggressive reversal in the federal funds rate--a ny further decline in the federal funds rate As a result, I have m used, the best way to s timulate the economy m ight be not to lower the funds rate further but to encourag e a decline in long rate s relative to short-term  rates.  How can we do that, I hear you ask?  [Laughter]

MR. MEYER. Perhaps, I m use again, we c ould do that by being unusually transparent- -that is, by in forming m arkets th at we view the eco nomy as weaker th an th ey appear to  be assum ing and that as a result the federal funds rate is less likely to rise as soon or as aggressively as they expect. As I said though, I am  just musing he re--I think--and perhaps amusing, [laughter] as opposed to m aking a serious policy recomm endat ion.      

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You’re on, Governor Kelley. 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. I really should pass at this point!  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  At the tim e of our last m eeting, the econom ic horizon already a ppeared dark, but there wa s little hard data yet available to judge the severity of unfolding events.  Since then we have gotten considerable inform ation that indicates that we have on hand a st eep and rapid decline that m ay be starting to feed on itself in a vicious cycle. It’s not a pretty picture. It continues to be m y view that m onetary po licy p layed a crucial and app ropriate ro le in the econom y over the first half of the year.  But we have now entered a period when its influence will be subo rdina te to th e unf olding of  other events, political and m ilitary , dom estic a nd international, and how they im pact on net with the psyche of the Am erican consum er.  Our challenge today is to identify how monetary policy can m ost usefully assist in assu ring a positive outcom e, and that will be discussed sh ortly.  This will be an interes ting exercise b ecaus e even if everyone had precisely the sam e view of the econom ic outlook, se veral different policy pres criptions can be seen as the best way to go. Although fiscal actions under consideration ha ve been discussed ear lier by several around the table, please let m e make a brief comment on th e expec tations that a te mporary investm ent tax incentive may induce a significan t early spu rt in capit al investm ent.  Obviously, such a tax break is quite attractive and tem pting.  However, given th e present environm ent of extrem ely low capacity 11/6/01 69 utilization, rising unem ploym ent, and weakenin g dem and, this gam bit may prove disappointing.  Beyond whatever level o f capital sp ending will o ccur regard less of events , a great m any firm s,  especially the sm aller ones that constitute half or more of th e nation’s production, are likely to conclude that attractive as this incentive m ay be, they sim ply cannot  afford to acquire nonessential additional capacity when their existing capacity is so underutilized and the ou tlook is so uncertain.  Larger and stronger companies who have m ore maneuvering room  in managing their capital structure are better cand idates to acce lerate th eir investm ents.  However, they m ay wait and see un til the last m inute before th e incen tive s unsets before making major discretionary commitm ents.  If that day is in the second half of 2004 it may com e too late to be of m uch help, as the tale of  the econom ic recovery will by then have long sin ce been to ld.  If the econo my is rebou nding, they will be investing anyway and the incentive would be unnecessary.  If the economy  is still in  the dold rums at that tim e, this incen tive is unlike ly to smoke them out, and policym akers will b e searching f or stronger m edicine.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you very much. We now turn to Don Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The policy easing you have already undertaken--and in particular th e 100 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate in the three weeks after Se ptember 11--anticipated a substantial downdraft in economic activit y.  Nonetheless, with th e incoming data indicating that the economy is even weaker than expected, and by a considerable margin, the question you would seem to be facing again today is not whether to ease further but rather by how much.  To be sure, your answer is not likely  to have an appreciable effect on the near-term trajectory of the economy, but it will alter interest rate expectations and asset prices now and in the future and, in so doing, will help to shape the eventual recovery. The exte nt of the contraction is important to your policy decision. The larger the out put gap created as the economy goes through this current period of weakness,  the stronger the rebound that can be accommodated consistent with satisfact ory inflation performance over the longer run. 11/6/01 70 have put a little more weight on a dec line of 50 basis points than one of 25.  The cumulative easing they have built into  the yield curve stands at close to 75 basis points by early next year. Alt hough whatever you decide is likely to have some effect on interest rates an d asset prices, the changes may not be large--at least immediately.  Much of the initial adjustment is likely to be in the expected timing of further ease--whe n markets see the funds rate hitting bottom, rather than in the level of the rate at that point.  But the cumulative size of the anticipated easing will be a ffected, at least a little, and possibly more so over time, as the markets factor  in their perceptions  of your concerns and responses when reacting to future information.  An important aspect of the decision today, then, is how you would like to nudge those expectations and asset prices in light of your a ssessment of the outl ook, the risks around that outlook, and the costs of the economy deviating to one side or the other of its most likely path. In the staff Greenbook forecast, only 25 basis points of further easing, along with greater fiscal stimulus th an assumed in the last forecast round, helps to promote a rebound in activity af ter a relatively shallow contraction.  Indeed, the added monetary and fiscal policy actions about compensate for the greater-than-expected near-term weakness,  leaving the level of output at the end of the projection period close to where it was predicted to be in the last forecast round.   In a couple of respects, financia l market prices suggest that participants in these ma rkets foresee a stronger re vival in economic activity than does the staff.  Markets are anticipating a little more easing than the staff has assumed, but also a quicker and more  substantial increase in the federal funds rate thereafter, presumably in  response to a more rapid pickup in growth. The rise in equity prices and the substantial narrowing of risk premiums on junk bonds over the inte rmeeting period are particularly noteworthy in the face of downward re visions to near-term economic and interest rate expectations. This more favorable attitude toward risk suggests that financial market participants ha ve become less fearful about future prospects and are expecting better earnings performance than is the staff.  Giving some weight to the stronger tenor  of market expectations would lend support to a decision to limit the easing at this meeting to  25 basis points. Moreover, the Committee may prefer to reduce the federal funds rate only 25 basis points at this meeting even  if it sees a high probability that further easing will eventually be needed.  Moving gradually, rather than front-loading the additional ease, might have a number of advantages.  Importantly, it could help you to calibrate the extent of your easing better.  Additional time should give you more information about  the economy’s developing response to your earlier actions, which include  some unusually large easings very recently.  In addition, the nature of th e fiscal response to September 11 could 11/6/01 71 well becom e clearer in th e next m onth or so, and you will hav e more data to help sort out the m ore persistent e ffects of the attacks on consum er and business behavior. Moreover, the Comm ittee m ay want to take account of the possibility that over the next severa l months the interaction of  market expectations and fragile public confiden ce will weigh heavily on the side of further easing as the econom y continues to  contract.  If the stance of policy is set now to fully an ticipate that onco ming weakness, you cou ld be faced with weighing the risks of disappointing the m arkets and the public on the one hand, or easing policy excessi vely on the other.  If financial markets have done a reasonably good job in reading your  intentions and building the policy actions you anticipate into cu rrent asset prices, little of the stabilization power of policy would be sacrif iced by m oving in m ore measured steps.  In the present situation, m arket pa rticipants are likely to continue to anticipate at least another 25 basis points of easing after a 25 basis point move at this meeting.  And that m ight be roughly consistent w ith your own estim ate of what will be needed, tho ugh, as noted, the structure of m arket rates also incorpor ates a substan tial policy tigh tening beginning later next year.       However, the risk in a gradual ap proach to policy implementation is that policy actions may turn out to be insufficient to forestall a cumulating, self-reinforcing, movement in the economy because the forces bearing on demand or prices prove to be stronger than the central bank or the markets anticipate, or because the economy is hit with another shock in the same direction. In the current circumstances,  with incoming data  and the near-term outlook considerably weaker  than anticipated at your  last meeting, and with the rebound still only a forecast, the Co mmittee may see a more aggressive policy easing of 50 basis points as bette r calibrated to the prevailing profiles of the economic risks and the costs a nd benefits of pot ential alternative outcomes.   The recent data may indeed be consistent with a short period of weakness in which adjustments are compressed and the stage is set for a fairly prompt and robust turnaround, as the fina ncial markets seem to believe.  But they also may be symptomatic of a d eeper and more prolonged contraction. The latter could occur as both households and businesses engage in a mutually reinforcing withdrawal to safer balan ce sheet and spending patterns in the face of the heightened level of uncertain ty and concern about the future.   The forecast of a reasonably shallow downturn and robust recovery depends not only on a measured response of households to high levels of job losses, but importantly also on stimulative fiscal actions that have not yet been agreed by Congress and the Administration.  Were such an agreement to be delayed significantly or stru ctured in such a way as to be less effective than has been assumed, easier monetary policy would be needed to carry more of the load in stimulating the economy.  And, a substantial s hortfall in fiscal stimulus could require appreciable further monetary accommodation.  The 11/6/01 72 counteracted m uch of the e ffect of your previous easings, raising questions about how much stim ulus from  monetary policy alone is now in train to counter m ore persistent forces of rest raint on private spendi ng behavior over the next few  quarters.  Moreover, th e downturn is unusually synchronous and interactive around the w orld, but global dem and m ay not get much of a boost from  monetary policy elsewhere--at leas t from policy in the other two main currency areas. The Bank of Japan is  constrained by a lack of effective alternatives, and the ECB seem s hamstrung from  vigorous action by a desire to build con sensus am id concerns ab out establish ing price stability creden tials in its initia l years. If the standard forecast is correct, were the Committee to ease by 50 basis points at this meeting and perhaps by smaller amounts in coming months, you would find yourselves next spring with a strengthening economy and monetary policy in a very stim ulative position.  But, unless the contraction is a lot shallower than most expect, you will also be facing an economy with a considerable margin of excess labor and capital that will be exerting downward pressure on inflati on.  In these circumstances, the FOMC should have ample time to begin to firm policy to forestall the onset of inflation pressures. If, on the other hand, the recent data signal that the economy is in a steeper contraction, you will want to have eased aggressively to cushion the fall and to foster a more rapid rebound. If the Committee sees inflation as most likely to be moving down as slack accumulates in labor and product ma rkets, it may perceive little benefit from risking a further shortfall from th e expected path of the economy and see reasons to lean a little ha rder against that possibil ity.  The cost of such a shortfall could be unusually large.  Not only is there the potential for cumulating downward movements in output fo r a time, but that spiral could be prolonged under circumstances in which the nominal federal funds rate is already low and the forces of restraint tu rn out to be large and persistent.  In these circumstances, economic slack c ould reduce inflation and inflation expectations so far that it became impo ssible for the Federal Reserve to drive real interest rates far en ough into negative territor y to counteract continuing weakness. If this is seen as a possi bility, acting graduall y--that is, “keeping the powder dry”--risks finding yourselves in  that very situat ion.  Therefore, it would be especially important to ac t preemptively to bolster the economy, limit disinflation, and forestall being “pinned to the zero bound,” as the Bluebook put it. Taken together, these aspects of the current situation may be seen as arguing for leaning on the side of another 50 basis point easing at this time, rather than 25. The larger action is  likely to lower somewhat market expectations of the funds rate over the next few months, but the effects of such revisions in reducing interest ra tes further out the yield curve and in 11/6/01 73 supporting equity prices m ay be seen as providing a desirable extra m argin of financial accomm odation in the face of  the downside risks an d costs.   Whatever you do, the tenor of th e incom ing data on both output and prices and th e downward revision to n ear-term  forecasts would suggest th at econom ic weakness continues to be more of a concern than rising inflation.  At som e point, near -term weakness will be ba lanced by the prospects of  an expansion in the future that could give rise to inf lation pressures, but for now and into the foreseeable future, the risks to ach ieving your ob jective for sustain able growth would seem  to outwe igh thos e to longer-ru n price s tability.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Questions  for Don?  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Don, doesn’t arguing for a 50 basis point cut, on the grounds that the econom y may be worse than we tho ught likely, lead to arguing for an  even larger cut because we ought to do all we can now given the lim ited inflat ion risks from  such an action?  You didn’t mention m aking no change in the fu nds rate, bu t that  would say that we react ed very strongly after the crisis--w hich I agree is what we should have  done--and are awaiting the e ffects of those actions, which haven ’t even come into p lay yet.  But the r ationale for a 50 basis point m ove is that we are so fearful that we think we should m ake a large cut.  It strikes me that that argues for an even greater cut given the uncertainty and the la ck of inflation risk from  that. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think it d epends on where you see the cen tral tendency of your forecast.  I believ e the central tend ency am ong Comm ittee members is for som ething like the Greenbook forecast--so me additional weakness followed by an upt urn next year.  We’re talk ing about the risk s around that central tendency. One could view 50 ba sis points of ease not so m uch as a response to the cen tral tendency forecast, if that appears to be a reasonab le forecas t, but rather to  the risks around that central tendency. By risks I m ean not onl y the risk that the econom y could turn out to be weaker and the rebound weaker, perhaps because the fiscal stim ulus doesn’t com e through, but also the costs of falling short. We could end up with a very severe disinflationa ry pressure that policy would have trouble catching up to--being behin d the curv e, as Comm ittee m embers som etimes like 11/6/01 74 to say. Getting behind the curve on the downside m ight be particularly costly at this tim e.  If you had a very weak central tendency fo recast, then  I would agree that you should be considering a larger cut. But with a central tend ency about like the staff forecast, I think we’re really talking about the risk around that forecast. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. May I ask one other question?   With a 50 basis point move, in your opinion a re we going to af fect the markets ’ expe ctations going f orward?  Will those e xpecta tions be completely revised and instead of  75 basis points of ease on the horiz on from where we are will they talk about another 75 basis points from  where we w ould be if we were to go with a larger cut? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think a move of 50 basis poi nts will have a relatively sm all effect on basis point cut. I don’t put too m uch weight on th e precise m easurem ent of that probability, but you would not be greatly surprising them  with such a cut.  I would expect som ething along the lines of what happened after your last m eeting when the ma rkets were debating between a reduction of 25 or 50 basis points. You did 50, and the m arkets revise d down the out-year E urodollar contracts by 7 to 9 basis points. And I think that kind of respons e would not be an unreaso nable one.  So I would anticipate som e downwa rd revision, but not a big one in the immediat e expectations.   

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. My q uestion is along the sam e line.  You’ve drawn--and m aybe this is just m y perspectiv e--wh at seem s to m e to be a fair ly stark difference between a cut of 25 versus a cut of 50 basis points. I must say I was troubled by your comm ent about getting ourselves into a liquidity trap without a 50 basis point cut.  I understood you to say that a 25 basis point cut would 11/6/01 75 not work to avoid that problem .  I found the st arkness of your argum ent a little off-putting and I thought you m ight expound a bit m ore on that. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think that’s part ly a function of how I structur ed the briefing, in term s of trying to give all the argum ents for doing 25 basis points and then all the argum ents for doing 50 basis points. It’s clearly a m atter of considerable judgm ent.  And there are argum ents on the 25 basis points side. This m ay be one of  those unusual situations--President  Jordan said he thought this might have happened over the last few weeks--whe re we really do get som e infor mation over the interm eeting period.  As he rem arked, we’ve been  disappointed by that inform ation.  As m any of you comme nted, the gridlock on fiscal pol icy may well persist past December 11th, the date of your next m eeting.  So I think there’s that argum ent.  The m arkets have built in m ore ease.  You’re only reducing expectations by a little.  We could be getting a rebound ne xt year.  It’s really m ore a question of where you want to take the risk. I don’t think the differences between the two choices I described are as stark as you s uggested, but there are differences in em phasis, differences in message, and differences in what m ight happen. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Let m e say a little about the im plicit com parison to the Japanese situation. We’ve been so m uch mo re aggressive in a very much shorter period of tim e than the Bank of Japan was. And our econom y is so m uch more resilient--people use that  word over and over-- than the ir econom y seems to be in ter ms of the expectations of consum ers and the innovation of businesses and so forth. I recognize that there is a potential fo r all of the academ ic work we’ve put into the zero bound on nom inal interest rates to com e into play here, but I question the reality of those expectations or those worries in  the context of where rates are now. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Well, you do have 250 basis points before you get down to where the Japanese rates are. So you have a ways to go. And I agree with you that our financial system --our 11/6/01 76 private econom y and our financial m arkets--is much  stronger than the Japanese system, which is really what is holding them  back. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Right. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. On the other hand, our econom y is subject to som e unusual shocks and we just don’t kn ow how businesses and h ouseholds w ill be respon ding to unfolding develo pments.  And there are downside risks. Some in the m arket see a bottom  to the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 percent.  So, the rate is approaching that level.  It may be a little prem ature to have boxes in the Bluebook and a discussion around this table of the zero bound, but it ’s not that prem ature.  One could construct a scenario in which there is a m ajor loss in confidence, as in the al ternative scenario in the Greenbook, or scenarios in which business ac tivity and foreign econom ies are m uch weaker.  I think we could all sit here and write down about three or four developm ents that would seriously weaken this econom y.  They would all have to occur at the sam e time--a num ber of very bad things happening at once- -including the possibility of  another terrorist attack.  It’s not impossible to im agine that six m onths from  now the Comm ittee could be dealing with  som e very, very low interest rates.  

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I don ’t put that out of the bounds  of possibilities.  It’s a question of how much control we use in the process of getting there. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. Governor Meyer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. I just have a comm ent on Don’s presentation. I thought you were especially effective this tim e, Don, in m aking the case for both a 1/4 point m ove and a 1/2 point move. Indeed, it was a bit of a roller coaster ride  for m e.  I felt m yself be ing swayed first in one direction and then whipsawed back in the other di rection.  So it was an en joyable ride!  Thank you. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Any further ques tions for Don? If not, let m e proceed. 11/6/01 77This is a p articularly dif ficult period and I want to start off with a f ew importan t issues.  The first is that we keep forecasting s tabilization but there has  been no evidence of it anywhere.  We go from  one Greenbook to the next with a projecti on of rising econom ic activity, at least beyond the near term .  And, indeed, by the processes we empl oy for forecasting, that conc lusion is inevitable.  The alternative forecast would be one that v iolates the ru les of statistical in ference o r, I should say , the great historical research th at Dave Stockton set into m otion, which concluded that the United States has never had a recession that  failed to end.  That general view  is very helpful, I know, but the important issue is for us to be aware that we are witnessing developm ents that are quite extraordinary. As a number of you have m entioned, the international outlook is continuing to deteriorate. We currently are observ ing the obvers e of the ex traord inary acceleration s that o ccurred in world econom ies during the latter part of the 1990s as a conseque nce of increased globalization--a developm ent that is now  seen as a two-edged swor d.  Indeed, the dispersion of growth rates in econom ies around the w orld has com e down ve ry dram atically.  There is an increasingly synchronous and m utually reinforcing pattern of econom ic activity am ong the world’s nations, and we are begi nning to see a gradual breakdown of barriers to stabilization as our econom y goes from  one stage to th e next.  The erosion is sl ow but persistent.  It is a developm ent that I don’t thi nk any of us has seen previously.  We certainly don’t put it into our econom etric m odels, whether they ar e structural or VAR.  Indeed, the one thing we can say about our m odels is that lef t to their own devices they will no t project a long-lasting def lation ary proc ess.  The coefficients and the structure of the m odels al ways produce an upturn at some point.  There is a tendency to revert to the type of growth path that has charact erized our econom ic history.  We cannot presum e that we can put a few exogenous assu mptions into our m odels and then conclude the model predictions are telling us som ething.  I subm it that that is not true.  We are telling the m odel 11/6/01 78 what to conclude by the way we have built it, and indeed the e xogenous inputs that we put in will not induce a contraction unl ess we go far beyond the norm al range of inputs that we have used in the past. Nonetheless, the real worl d has the potential to generate de flation, and I think we are m oving gradually from  a disinflationary process toward a situ ation w here we could begin to experience outright deflation. I think that inflation rates finally are gettin g down to a level that can satisfy Al Broaddus, which is som ething I thought would never em erge.  But the point is that he’s right.  At this s tage I d on’t know what the n ext Greenbook is  going to sh ow, but I would wager th at it will indicate a w eaker economy.  What is very distur bing is that w e have not  yet seen any underlying basis for stabilization. In that regard I found the comments around this  room  very distressing.  To be sure, nobody has said that the economy is weakening substantially; it is not r ecovering, but neither is it going dow n precipitously.  There is one part of our econom ic system  that is saying in effect  that the econom y is stabilizing. It is called the stock market, and I hope it is right.  The stock m arket patterns of the last several weeks are essentially projecting a bo ttom in the U.S. econom y and the world econom y sometime in the early months of 2002.  If the m arket were a person, I would ask about the basis for such a conclusion. Earnings exp ectations continue to decline, and we are seeing patterns that historically would suggest a rally in a bear m arket that m ay be perfectly consistent w ith a subsequent stock m arket charts going back to  the 19th century to take much comfort in recent developm ents. I think the surge in m otor vehicle sales is a fascinating phenom enon beca use I do not believe that we can explain it wholly in term s of price discounting.  The problem  unfortunately is that the estim ate for Oct ober sales is so bizarrely out of the ordinary  that even if there is a good deal 11/6/01 79 of real change in the dem and for mo tor veh icles, sales will still have to com e down very sharply just to get back to som ething resem bling norm al.   I think we are looking at developm ents that im ply a very difficult policy issue.  My first reaction to the em ployment data on Friday was to presum e that the wisest thing for us to do today would be to move the funds rate dow n 25 basis points , given the downside risks,  and  to continue to make 25 bas is point m oves as long as we have to.  I struggled through the weekend reviewing numerous anecdotal reports and look ing carefully at the simulations that our m odels are creating.  And m ost interestingly I took a rea lly close look at what is going on abroad, where the data are not as good as ours but they are in creasingly m ore disturbing.   I thought that your UPS report, Bi ll, was strik ing because it is anecdotally consistent w ith what we are seeing, nam ely a gradua l but continuous contra ction with no evidence of any degree of stabilization .  I believe we are at  a point where we are beyond disinf lation and getting to the edge of a deflationary process. This means that even if we were to provide a great deal of stimulus, we would still have to deal with disi nflation before we could create a problem of inflation.  So we have a few stages to go through. I must adm it that one of the things I read wh ich sort of struck m e as being relevant was that little box on the “zero  bound” that Vince and his staff put in the Bluebook.  I thought it really addressed the key question. I don’t think any of us has a big dispute on the econom ic outlook.  But there is a crucial dispute h ere. It re lates to the i ssue of whether we want to keep our powder dry or whether we want to make sure that we put in enough shot to knock down the opponent before the opponent eventually does us in. I started with the view that keeping the powder dry was the w isest policy, but as I struggled through the weekend I cam e out where Al Broaddus is.  The reason I would argue for such 11/6/01 80 an adjustm ent is that policy inva riably gets down to the issue of what happens if we are wrong.  And what I conclude is that if  doing 50 basis points today is wrong--if it  turns out that the econom y starts to stabilize tom orrow and a lot of things go well--being required to m ove our funds rate target back up would be the m ost delightful p roblem we could c onceivab ly face.  I don’t an ticipate that.  I think the chances of that happ ening are ex traord inarily  remote.  I do think that if we have an inadequate response today, there is a danger--because as I see it we are at a critical point in the way this econom y is functioning--that we will  be taking too high a risk.  I don’ t know what the future holds for us. I don’t think any of us can know. But on the basis of what we do know, what is the downside if we do 25 and we are wrong or we do 50 a nd we are wrong?   In m y judgm ent the answer to that question is pretty forceful. As a conseque nce I m ust say that, after great struggle, I com e out in favor of 50 basis poin ts.  I wouldn’t go to 75 basis poin ts largely becau se I am  not absolute ly convinced that I am  right.  If I were , I would argue for that larger m ove. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. May I ask you a question? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Sure. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. I would appreciate your opini on on this.  By going with a 50 basis point change, are we likely to foster e xpectations, not just in financial markets but in the econom y more genera lly, th at we will d o at le ast an other 25 bas is points and  will th at ind uce people to hold back because they anticipate furthe r easin g?           

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. I think th e expecta tion that we will do another 2 5 basis poin ts will be bu ilt into th e market.  I’m not su re tha t’s all bad.  I very much suspect, in term s of the way Don put it, that we already have a go odly part of that further easing baked into the position of the funds m arket would b e.  And taking B ill Poole’s general edict, we m ust be careful of 11/6/01 81 what we construct out there beca use how we respond to what is in  the forward m arkets has a very significant impact. So I think it is far safer for us  to be m oving 50 basis points, and frankly that is what I would like to put on the table, and to conti nue in any case a bias toward econom ic weakne ss.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Mr. Chairm an, I s upport your recomm endation, probably with the usual enthusiasm  of the recen tly converted,  because I entered the w eekend with a view that we ought to ease by 25 basis points a nd over the course of th e weekend changed m y opinion. Somewhat symbolically I have a pond behi nd m y house in W estchester County and there are a lot of fish in the pond. Therefore, I have tw o hawks, and th e hawks enjoy fishing in the pond.  This is a true story, though what w ill follow is not true.  [Laughter] This past weekend--now we get into m ythology--one of the hawks miraculously tu rned into a beautiful white dove.  I was very confused until I realized that wh at was even m ore miraculous was that the dove spoke with a southern accent! [Laughter] And that convinced me even m ore that the 50 basis point m ove was appropriate. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Wow! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENPAN. I second that. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  Let m e respond to the question that Tom  Hoenig raised on the m arket reaction.  If we  ease 50 basis points, th e market will assum e that we will eas e at least 25 basis points m ore.  If we ease 25 basis poin ts, the market will m ake the same assum ption but will be conf used, I th ink, about whether we are slowing down just for th e sake of slowing down, which I th ink is a bad m essage to send.  If we eas e by 75 bas is points, that will create an imm ense amount of c onfusion, probably starti ng with the notion that we know a whole lot m ore with a greater degree of certainty than anybody else does and that  the dow nside we’re all concerned about is now 11/6/01 82 our central f orecas t.  That would be very dangerous .  So we certainly do n’t want to d o that.  The conclusion is that a 50 basis point cu t, with th e balance of  risks still toward inadequate growth, is the right though difficult conclusion.

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairm an, I agree with your preference f or a 50 basis point cut in the funds rate. For m e the downside risk s to the outlook are sizable as illu strated by em erging data, which keep signaling lo wer and lower forecas ts for real GDP growth.  Also, as noted  in the Bluebook and commented on by Governor Meyer a nd by you, a larger preem ptive easing m ove now another compelling reason to do 50 basis points at this tim e. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Governor Gram lich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  Mr. Chairm an, I support your recomm endation.  The good news in what you said was that you cam e out with a policy that I support.  But th e bad news is that you actually scared m e a bit more th an I was already.  Nevertheless, I do support your proposal. Let m e also address Tom ’s question.  I’ve had a little trouble with this myself because changes of 50, 25, or even 75 basis points aren’t th at huge.  And as Tom  points out, if there’s an argum ent for getting the funds rate  down, why don’t we get it dow n? The way I would rationalize what we’re doing is that there is a sense in wh ich we are speaking in code here.  We’ve been operating under a procedure for a wh ile where 50 points is viewed as  a big change and the Fed being responsive. A move of 25 basis points is viewed  as a little change and the Fed not being very responsive. Seventy-five basis poi nts is language we’ve never used. So I think it’s particularly important to be clear in our comm unication, as  many people around the table have said.  To m e that’s a powerful argum ent for continuing th e dialog that we’ve already been having. 11/6/01 83

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairm an, I can support the recomm endat ion, al though I certainly came into this m eeting favoring a m ove of 25 basis poi nts.  The way I see the issue is as follows.  As you certainly have said on m any occasions--and I have said the sam e thing--we believ e that the U. S. econom y has essentially undim inished long-run prosp ects.  The question, I suppose, is when those long-run prospects will m aterialize.   If we believe that they ar e com ing in 2008 or 2010, that’s a long time away.  It seem s to m e that the tenor of the views around this table is th at we m ay have a very, very difficult five years, and th at the risks are decidedly on the dow nside for the reaso ns that p eople have discussed. I think our statem ents about the long-run prospects for our econom y are part of the reason why long-term  rates have not gone down very m uch.  In my view we have expressed a lot of optim ism about the outlook for the econom y and I th ink those statem ents of optim ism do not fully reflect the b eliefs th at we heard arou nd the tab le today in term s of, let’s say, the nex t three to f ive years. Would I bet m y house on m y own convicti on on this score?  No. Obviously, we’re going through a very difficult period--one that has no clear  analog in history, yet one where to date the absolute lev el of declin e in activity h as been m ild.  But we apparently are projecting a considerable risk of a steeper decline to com e.  So, if we really  want the reduction in th e funds rate to translate into declines in longer-term  interest rates, I think we need to change a bit the tone of what we say in our statem ent and in ou r testim ony a nd speeches.   Presum ably we do believe that the long-run prospects for the economy are sound and essentiall y undim inished and we should say that.  But we 11/6/01 85 also need to say som ething along the lines --I don ’t know  how to word this --that we have ahead of us, in calendar quarters or m aybe even years, a very  significant risk that the econom y could require a period of prolonged and subs tantial monetary easing. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Let me just comment on that.  First of all, if we seriously believed the tim e horizon was five years, then I think m aking a statem ent that the long-term prospects are optim istic is in any m eaningful sense ju st wrong.  When I talk a bout it, I’m  thinking in terms of two years or som ething in that range.  If in fact our comm ents are holding long-term  interest rates up--if indeed we’re that powerf ul--then I subm it to you that if we take the position that the world is going to be awful for the next five years, we can create th at result even  if it’s not in prospect now. So I would be careful about what we say we perceive.  I personally  don’t believe that the problem s are deep seated to the extent that we ar e looking at a situation li ke the 1930s or som ething of that sort. But I do think that  we are going through a period where the next year or next couple of years is going to be subnorm al.  I don’t know whethe r I’m  talking about just the first part of that period or wh ether the second part als o will invo lve less than adequate g rowth.  But I’m surely not arguing that it’s going to go on for l onger than that.  I have no evid ence that that is the case.   

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I appreciate your comment on that.  My be lief--conviction would be too strong a word here--is th at we will g o through an  adjustm ent, which when we look back at th is period som etime in the future, will be regarded as a cyclical adjustm ent and not a change in the secular outlook for the econom y.  I think we will be pul ling out of this situation along the lines of the Greenbook forecast. I view that as a very good o utlook.  But if that is really what we have in front of us, then it seem s to me that we already have a very substantial am ount of m onetary ease in place.  And to m e the argum ent for 50 basis points today rath er than  25 is not totally con sistent with th at outlook. That’s what concerns m e about looking at it this way.  I am also concerned that there is a 11/6/01 86 sense in which we have double-coun ted the recen t bad news.  After all, we have cut the funds rate 100 basis points since Septem ber 11th in anticipation of bad news, the weak econom ic data to com e.  And we got the bad numbers. In part what we are saying today is that we are cutting the funds rate again by 50 basis points now that we see the actu ality of  the weak data.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But, r emember, we have rev ised down the forecast s ince those earlier cuts. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I understand. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It’s not as t hough  the forecast rem ained unchanged from the imm ediate post-Septem ber 11th period. If it had, we would be in far better shape now. The outlook has deteriorated.  That’s the problem . 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. At any rate, where I com e out is that I’m  concerned about doing 50 basis points now and about the process that I think we are getting into.  I'm not goi ng to dissent; that’s not my point. I’m just indicating the reasons unde rlying m y prefe rence for 25 basis points.  The likelihood is  that we will have m ore weak econo mic data ahead of us and I th ink the m arket will read in another 50 basis points of ease at our next m eeting.  I’m not sure that that dynam ic is really helpful. That’s essentially what I am saying. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I’ve long thought that a variety of unforecastab le internal and extern al shocks do ha ppen and that there’s no thing m uch we can do about that but try to interpret them  and respond a ppropriately.  And we can hope that we don’t get a success ion of shocks going in the s ame direction  that bu ilds into a cum ulative p rocess.  To m y mind the role of policym akers is often one  of trying to avoid becom ing part of the problem rather than part of the solution. I do believe that in som e episodes in  the history of this cent ral bank and others in the 11/6/01 87 world the po licym akers becam e part of the problem rath er than part of the solution.  That’s the basis, too, for m y comments earlier about fi scal policy.  I’m not convinced that what is going on now in the fiscal arena is all that con structive.  But actu ally I’m less concerned today th an I was five weeks ag o that m onetary policy is not properly calibrated.  At that time I was worried  that things were m oving in the direction of rational risk aversion so fast th at we m ight find that the funds rate was too high to be consis tent with th e appropriate thrust of m onetary policy.  Given the Desk’s net injections of liquidity over the period si nce then, I actually feel more comfortable that the level is not too high.  Moreover, my confidence in the in herent resiliency of a m arket econom y and its tendency to expand following shocks is undim inished.  My uncertainty re mains about what kind of internal or external shocks we need to be prepared for. So I would have been perfectly comfor table to stay with an unchanged funds rate at this m eeting, given my reading of the events since October 2nd. Looking at the yield curve--the four-week, the three-m onth, and the six-month bill rates--it’s hard to disagree with a cut of  50 basis points.  I can’t say that th at’s wrong.  But I’m  actually fairly comfortable with where we are. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairm an, I will take your l ead on this.  But I also w ant to exp ress a differing view in the sense that while our econom y obviously had a terrible shock, we have taken very aggress ive and I think appropriate action and monetary p olicy is now in an accom modative position. Some time has to pass before we will see an upturn, even with th is accomm odative position, an d I believe it will take place.  I hav e confidence in the future.  In my view the U.S. econom y is quite different from  Japa n’s in term s of its soundness and its abil ity to recover from  the shock. So I would be comfortable with no change or a 25 basis point change  today.  I think we are raising expectations with this m ove of 50 basis point s.  People are going to be m aking decisions now 11/6/01 88 in the an ticipation that there will be  more ease to  com e and I think th ere is a risk to th at as far as the econom y goes as well.  I will certainly follow your  lead on this.  These are difficult times and I realize it’s hard to know the right an swer.  But I think we could afford to be m ore patient and let the flow of ti me work. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I, like President Hoenig, woul d be m uch more comfo rtable with a m ove of 25 basis points or even no cha nge versus your recomm endation of 50 basis points.  I want to go through some of m y thinking on this.  I think it’s ri ght to ease further.  I had the sam e kind of battle with m yself over the weekend that a couple of  other people in this room , including you, Mr. Chairm an, have talked about.  But I continue to believe that there’s some need for caution.  We have a lot of  monetary po licy ease in the pipeline and potential fi scal stim ulus as well.  It’s im portant not to overreac t.  The reces sion seem s to be baked in the cake no w; the inco ming data will b e negative.  But the process has to play itself out. And as Dave Stockton m entioned, recessions do inevitably come to an end.   There’s not a lot we can do about the near term .  Monetary policy doesn’t work in the near term.  It can be a support for confidence. And I think we provided support through our policy actions after the terrorist attacks;  we put enough into the pipeline to  bolster confidence.  But right now I don’t see further easing as a confidence-bolstering m ove.  I think it is likely to work in the direction of confirm ing people’s thoughts about the im potence of monetary policy because there won’t be m uch effect in the near term .  Instead, m ost of the im pact will be felt next year--around th e end of the first quarter or the beginning of th e second quarter perhaps--when the economy is expected to be picking u p anyway.  And I have gr eat faith th at it will b e picking up.  How, when, and to what degree, I don’t know, but  I think this econom y has a lot of  resilience.  In fact, people 11/6/01 89 have m entioned that lower rates now  could ac tually increase long rate s because the market apparen tly sees a quicker pickup than does our forecast. There’s p robably not a lot of difference between  a move of 25 or 50 basis points today.  I don’t see big differences in outcom es.  I don’t see th e stark distinctions that Don was drawing and I don’t see m ajor differences in being wrong here.  But I do think that a 25 basis point cut would suggest a bit m ore control on our part.  I think it would show that we are being m ore forward-looking rath er than focu sing on the recent incoming data .  To me it would  indicate th at wherever we stop the policy position m ight be a little les s stimulative to the inevitable uptur n than otherwise.  I don’t see the com parison to the current Japane se situation, though I fully understand the front-loading part of that argum ent.  I don’t think going 25 basis points ve rsus 50 would indicate that the central bank in the United States is part of the probl em rather  than par t of the solu tion.  But all that said, I do take your points on the feedback effects of  the international situa tion now and the potential for a downward spiral. And if the psychology doesn’t work dom estically, I thi nk it does work a little on the in ternational sid e.  It’s a tough call for me right now but I am  willing to go with your leadership. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I started out m y comments earlier by saying that this is an uncertain and unprecedented tim e.  That clearly was evident as we went around the room  and he ard the comm ents during the go-around, which I too found very depressing.  I expected it com ing into the m eeting because all the data an d all the anecdotes were so  negative.  I guess at some point we are going to get som e positive anec dotes.  I keep looking for them  but I haven’t found them  yet.   11/6/01 90There is clearly a risk that the g reater caution we’ve seen by consum ers and business firm s could cum ulate into a more severe recession.  When one looks at the consensus of the forecasts that are out there, those forecasts seem  to discount anything like that.  I personally think the econom y is going to be weaker than the Greenbo ok forecast a nd weaker than m y staff’s forecas t too for that matter.  Therefore, I do feel that a 50 basis point cut is safer and I support it .  I, too, am  concerned about the interconnectedness of th e international econom y and the f eedback to our econom y, whi ch is the result of globalization--a developm ent that, of course, all of us have supported f or many, m any years. I thin k we just ha ve to watch the situatio n very, very carefully as we m ove for ward.  So I support your recomm endation, Mr. Chairm an. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. Mr. Chairm an, first I’d like to correct the re cord reg arding Al and I swapping hats. The point of m y remem bering the Alam o was that even though the defenders lost the battle it was not because they were keeping their p owder dry.  So basically,  he cam e around to m y point of view! [Laughter] I agree with your recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairm an, this is the m ost fascinating m eeting in m y six years at the table. People have often asked m e if I ever ch ange m y mind during the co urse of a m eeting and I always say “yes,” but I’m not sure that I often d o.  Today is probably the exception.  I not only w ent into the weekend but I cam e out of t he weekend thinking that either no policy action today or a modest m ove was the right decisi on.  I certainly have com e som e way during the course of the meeting and I think I understand th e downside risks m ore fully.  Having said that, I’m still of the view that a modest m ove today f eels m ore right to m e.  I think Don m ade a credible argum ent for such a policy. I share th e concern s of Cathy Minehan and Bill Poole that we m ay in fact build in 11/6/01 91 expectations for even m ore easing than we would like.  I think  there ’s even a chance of a scare factor; peop le will think that we believe the econo my is far worse than they  thought.  Having said all that, I support your recommenda tion and understand the argum ents for a 50 basis point m ove. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Will you r ead th e appropriate wording ? 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD. This is from  page  13 in the Bluebook:  “The Federal Open Market Comm ittee seeks m onetary and fina ncial conditions that will f oster price stability and prom ote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objec tives, the Comm ittee in the  imm ediate future seeks conditions in reserve m arkets consiste nt with reducing the federal funds rate to an average of around 2 percent.” The sentence for the press statem ent would be:  “Against the b ackground of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable econom ic growth, and of the inform ation currently available, the Comm ittee believes that the risks continue to be weighted m ainly toward conditions that m ay generate econom ic weakness in the foreseeable f uture.”

MR. GRAMLICH. May I vote also?  [L aughter]  I believe I’m entitled to. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD. All right, G overnor Gramlich.  I have you voting “yes.”  [Laughter] 11/6/01 92 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  I didn’t think I w as that trans parent!  I vote “yes. ” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  The p reliminary st atem ent that has been drafted is very close to the previous on e.  It’s very short and it will be circu lated to you.   In the m eantim e I requ est that the Board of Governors retir e to the room  next door so that  we can act on a discount rate request. So, this m eetin g is in reces s and we will return shortly. [Recess] 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Do y ou need a vote on this statem ent? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  No. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I just want to ask whether it’s  really necessary to m ake what could be interpreted a s derogato ry reference s to enhancing security.  It’s clea r that the diversion of resources to secur ity enhancem ent will have a negativ e effect on produ ctivity, but d o we really need to say that in this sta tement?  After all, the whole world is  dependent upon people feeling com fortable with the security m easures being taken becaus e the world ha s changed  forever, in my view anyway.  People need to feel that these m easures will be beneficial for the long te rm.  I don’t think we need to say this. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think that’s a valid criticism .  Would som ebody else like to comm ent on it? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Well, if we don’t say som ething about the reduction in productivity  over the sh ort run, for what ever reason, the s tatem ent will suggest th at we think productivity is going to boun ce back as soon as this econom ic slowdown abates.  That sounds too m uch like whistling in the wind.  I’m not sure  we need to blam e it on protection and security measures.  But I think we have to say that som ething is happening that likely will af fect productivity adversely for a while. 11/6/01 93

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  No, I agree with that .  I think the question is whether or not we phrase it in the way it is phrased here. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Can we just say that because of the econom ic slowdo wn or the cyclical impact or som ething like that p roductivity g rowth  will slow ? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  No, there is a height ened risk  prem ium that has oc curred as a consequence of this. What we’re  talking abou t, in th e extr eme form, is the elim ination of  just- in-time invento ries. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes, I know what you m ean.  But I don’t think this is the tim e to be sounding quite so negative about security. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Well, could we say the “app ropriate” o r the “nec essary” diversion of resources to enhance security or so mething along those lines to suggest  that it is we ll understood that resources will be used in this way? 

[SECTION]

MR. KELLEY. I think th e word “necessary” is good. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, why don’t we say the “n ecessary div ersion of resources”? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  Yes, that d oes it. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Or how about just the “reallocation of resources”? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  No, “necessary” addr esses the issue th at Ca thy is r aising. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  That turn s it positiv e. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Is that adequate? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH. Well, let m e first comment  on the broader point and I’ll also talk about the w ords used.  Conti nuing with Bill McDonough’s whistling in the wind arg ument, I think we also have to show that we recognize this  phenom enon, whether we call  it a reallocation or a 11/6/01 94 diversion of resources. So I think we actually have to  tie that in there.  “Necessary ” is f ine with m e.  Also, there’s a double clause in there with “and pr otect against disruptions.”   We might not need that. A lot of words are devoted to that sen tence and it could be stripped down.  But in m y view we have to recognize not only that it will be a whil e before productivity com es back, but also that a diversion of resources is o ccurring.  Otherwise the m essage just doesn’t look real. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Would you feel better if we said:  “The n ecessary div ersion of resources to enhance security  is likely to detract from  adva nces in produ ctivity for a tim e”? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. How about “necessa ry reallocation of resource s”? I think that was somebody’s suggestion.  That sounds a little better. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAM LICH.  Okay. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH .  That’s better. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. But the econom ic slowdown all by itself produces a reduction in productivity. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  No, the reference here  is to structural productivity.  I might note that the estim ate for productivity in the thir d quarter is going to be coming out tom orrow.  I don’t know what the precise num ber is going to be, but  it’s going to show st rong productivity in the quarter. If we subtract ed out the Septem ber 11th problem , it would be supportive of the fact that there have been structural changes in produc tivity in the last four or five years. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So it’s not cy clical productivity we’re talking about. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. No, I realize that. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Mr. Chairm an, could I offer a sl ightly different perspective?   It m ay be consistent w ith what is bothering Cathy.  The last clause is a clear statem ent that productivity grow th 11/6/01 95 is good. I might think that and everybody around this table m ight think that.  But hypothetically, suppose 20 years ago w e had substituted for the term  “to enhance security” the phrase “to clean up the air and the water”? The vast m ajority of pe ople believe that whatever is being done in our country to enhance security is fo r the good.  For the tone of our stat ement to som ehow suggest that it is really unf ortunate that our country has to do this, I think is very undesirable.   

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. That’s my point exactly.  You stated it so much better than I did. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I agree with th at.  That’s why the words “necessary reallocation”-- 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I don’t think that takes away the negative tenor. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Pardon me, but it’s a measurem ent issue, isn’t it?  The GDP doesn’t measure increased security; it doesn’t give better secu rity a positive weight.  Is there a way to get the word “measurement” in here? 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Measured productivity. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, that may do it. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. We’re trying to get acro ss a very sophisticated concept here. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, measured productivity.  I think the key question as far as the statement goes is:  Do we want to leav e in “and protect against production disruptions”? 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes, right. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. I don’t think we need that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The sentence is ve ry long.  Let me read it and see whether or not we need that phrase. “Although the nece ssary…” Do we want to say “reallocation” or “diversion”? 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL. “Reallocation.” 11/6/01 96 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  “Realloc ation” is m ore positiv e. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. “Although the nece ssary reallocation of resources to enhance security is likely to detract f rom measured advances in productiv ity for a time, the long-term prospects for productivity grow th and th e econom y remain favorable and should becom e evident once the unusual forces  restraining dem and abate.” 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Did you keep in “advances in  productivity” or did you say “m easured productivity”? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The first reference is to m easured productivity.  The second one is to true productivity growth so  I would leave the word “m easured” out. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. But one could argue, along the lines that President Jordan did, that the actual produ ctivity of the U.S. ec onomy is better because of what might have been lo oked at as overhead ex penditu res o n clean air and clean water.  This reallocation of resources m ay turn out not to be a terrible development. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let me tell you what  the problem  is.  If we ’re going to get into this, we’ve got a serious problem, which is whether in f act we’re measuring efficiency o r improve ments in th e quality of our s tandard of liv ing. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Environ mental and other types of controls do not increase efficiency. They im prove the quality of lif e.  Measured p roductiv ity is efficiency. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. The i mproved quality of life could m ake the overall labor force more efficient. 11/6/01 97

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  It’s conceivable, but that’s not what is being m easured.  One way of looking at it is that a lo t of activities basically do n’t bene fit us because th ey are in so me sense protective. A big chunk of medical expenditures falls into  that category; it depends on whether th e expense is f or preven tive or curative purposes.  What I’m  trying to ge t at here is th at this involves a very serious conceptual problem . 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I kno w. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  We d on’t want to get in to tha t. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. No, we don’t. But I also don ’t think we want to come out with a statem ent that could be interpreted negatively.  Granted, there are a zillion different sophisticated argum ents one can m ake about why this statem ent is true.  I still think the pub lic interp retation of it will be neg ative with reg ard to se curity. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Can we say “the a ppropriate reallocation of resources”?  I made the statem ent in testim ony to Congress in very m uch this way.  I got very positive responses. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  Absolutely.  I dispute the m ajor prem ise here, which is that it’s negative. I don’t find it negative fo r the Federal Reserve to say that investm ent in security is a good thing, which is in  my view what we’re saying.  I absolutely fail to see how that’s negative. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Well, m aybe it’s ju st an interpretation.  I think investm ent in security is a good thing right now. That’s what we need. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. Mr. Chairm an, if you wanted  to appear more neutral, the verb “detracts ” may also seem negativ e. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes. 11/6/01 98

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. So if instead it said “is likely to slow the advance in m easured productivity” I think that w ould pretty m uch go in the direction of neutrality. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. I think that’s very good. I’d suggest the language “may restrain advances in productivity,” whic h is shorter and less awkward.  

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. How about “m ay restrain ad vances in near-term  measurem ents of productivity.” 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  You’re on a roll, Al! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  Let’s do it. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. “May re strain advances? ” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes, in that contex t we don’t really need m easured.  Let m e reread it. “Although th e”--do you want to say necessary or appropriate? 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER( ?).  “Appropriate.” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. “Although the appr opriate reallocation of resources to enhance security m ay restrain advances in produc tivity for a tim e, the lon g-term  prospects” etc. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC DONOUGH.  Great. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. That’s shorter. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think that does it. 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER( ?).  All right! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  May I just ask a question? In the second paragraph, third line, is the phrase “for the foreseeab le future” n ew in this s tatem ent?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE ENSPAN.  No, it’ s par t of the boile rplate. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW .  We had it in  previous statem ents? 11/6/01 99 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Oh yes, it’s part of the boilerplate. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  We’ve had that in our statements since the Ferguson Committee came up with it. 

[SECTION]

MR. MEYER. It’s in a slightly  different location in this stat ement, but we always use it.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay? 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Fine. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman, may I suggest th at the Committee reconsider using the word “necessary” to describe the reallo cation of resources ra ther than “appropriate”?  Several people suggested “necessary” during the course of the discus sion and I think it may be a little better there. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think that’s a good suggestion.  Is that okay with everybody? 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I didn’t think we could rewrite the press statement as a Committee, but we did!  The next meeting is December 11, 2001.  We adjourn for lunch.
