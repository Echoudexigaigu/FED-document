CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, ev eryone.  Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes of our January 29-30 meeting? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  So move. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objec tion, they are approved.  Mr. Kos. MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the set of charts that has been distributed. In the top panel on th e first page, U.S. cash and forward deposit rates are shown in red.  The forward rate s—the dashed red lin es—moved higher in a more pronounced manner after a string of stronger-than-expected economic data and Chairman Greenspan’s Senate appearance on March 7.  The three-month forward rate is trading at 2½ percent, a bout ½ percentage point above the cash rate, and the nine-month forward rate rose nearly a full percentage point in th e past five weeks or so to almost 4 percent.  European rates, the gr een lines, showed the same general pattern though not to the same degree as U.S. rates.  Traders apparently believe that European interest rates, which did not fall as much as U.S. rates did in 2001, will not rise as much in 2002. Japanese interest rates stayed  low, and the Bank of Japan continued to provide significant liquidity to the yen mone y market.  As we approach the end of the fiscal year, there is no hint of a Japane se premium in yen money markets and only a very slight premium that shows up periodi cally in dollar money markets—at least based on traditional indicators such as th e British Bankers Association poll.  However, market reports suggest that unsecured lending to  Japanese banks has been scaled back significantly.  Meanwhile, Japane se banks have resorted  to raising dollars via foreign exchange swaps with non-Japan ese banks wherein th ey are swapping in dollars in exchange for yen. The foreign banks  doing these trades are able to raise the yen at negative interest rates, so even if invested at a zero  interest rate they can earn a positive spread. Turning to page 2, Treasury yields began to rise in late February in response to the same factors that moved short-term in terest rates.  From February 26 through yesterday, the two-year yield rose about 60 basis points.  And the spread of the two-year note over the fed funds target was at 185 basis points ye sterday, the highest spread in that relationship since January 1995.  Similarly, the spread between the ten-year note and the fed funds target was 355 basis points, the wi dest since May 1994.  Finally, the spread between  the thirty-year bond—or I should say the twenty-nine­year bond—and the target fed funds rate was just shy of 400 basis points, the widest since May 1993.  In the private sector, accounting and disclosure issues hung over the corporate market during much of the peri od and securities of i ndividual firms were periodically repriced. But spreads as a whole were steady or  even narrowed slightly.  1 Materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).     names or sectors, but on ba lance it hovered near 125 basi s points.  As shown by the solid blue line, the spread between A and AAA yields actually narrowed somewhat during the period. The trend of narrowing spreads is more pronounced in the lower quality sectors of emerging-market debt a nd high-yield markets.  Both the EMBI+ and the Merrill Lynch high-yield indexes narrowed dramatically, as investors’ risk appetite seemed to revive and they priced in increasing odds of a global recovery.  The Merrill Lynch high-yield spread narrowed to its lowe st level since September 2000, and the EMBI+ spread narrowed to its tightest level since July 1998, but the recent recomposition of the EMBI index exagge rates the scale of that improvement.   Turning to page 3, volatility trends in major asset markets are shown in the top panel. The S&P 100 Volatility Index, also known as the VIX, has been declining for some weeks now into the low 20s—at the lowe r end of its range of the last six or seven years of 20 to 35 or 40 percent. In general, high levels have been associated with periods of stress and falli ng equity prices.  Some analysts have asserted that the current level of implied volatility suggests a complacent attitude among investors.  Others, however, note that equity volatility  above 20 percent is a relatively recent phenomenon; before 1995 equity volatilities were frequen tly in the 10 to 15 percent range. These analysts sugge st that, with the boom and bust behind us, a period of more-modest returns may be consistent with  a reversion toward lower volatilities.  The middle panel graphs the im plied volatility of the Eurodollar interest rate futures contract. That volatility ha d stayed at a high level in the months after September 11 but recently has declined to its lowest level since that date, though it remains at elevated levels compared with its histor ical average.  Finally, the bottom panel depicts the one- and twelve-month implied volatilities in the euro-dollar exchange rate. With that exchange rate trading in a fairly narrow range between 0.86 and 0.89, the volatility has eased into si ngle digits, and the one-year implied volatility is at its lowest point since November 1999. Turning to page 4, let me say a few words on Japan and Japanese assets. The yen, which had been exhibiting weakness early in 2002, had a dramatic about-face starting in mid to late February.  For most of January  and part of February  the talk in markets was about the possibility of a major crisis around the end of the fiscal year.  This led to a “sell Japan” mentality and the prices of equities, JGBs, and the value of the yen all declined. As the talk about the crisis swelled, mark ets began to look forward to two events in late February—the release of the government’s “anti-deflation plan” due to come out on February 27 and the Bank of Japan’s policy board meeting on the days before its release, and it containe d little that was new or viewed as being truly helpful in fighting deflation. The one  concrete step was a tightening of short selling rules on equities. This was co upled with the announcement—a few days before the plan was released—of sanctions by the FSA against four foreign firms for violating the then-existing short selling rules. Between  aggressive buying by public pension funds and a short covering rally, th e Nikkei rose about 26 percent from its low in early February to its peak in early March.  On February 28 the Bank of Japan’s       pace of its JGB acquisitions from ¥800 bill ion to ¥1 trillion per month.  JGB yields Japanese asset prices rising, the yen appr eciated sharply in late February, though it has depreciated to a level of a bout 1.31 in the past day or so. Turning to page 5, a word on domestic reserves management.  The top chart shows monthly rates of growth in currency over the past ye ar and our forecast for the next few months.  Currency growth has been  well above trend in many recent months.  Late last year, just when it looked as if it was getting back to normal, we experienced unexpectedly rapid growth for several months .  Argentina has been part of the story, but domestic demand for currency has also been strong.  The bottom panel shows, by maintenance periods, the aggregate size of domestic financial assets held by the Federal Reserve.  The gray line represen ts our permanent SOMA holdings, and the red line shows total holdings, including repurchase agreements, both long and short term.  Aggregate holdings will simply reflect the behavior of autonomous factors and demands for Fed balances.  The underlying ch anges in this series over time mostly reflect currency growth. The size of our total RP holdings rose quite suddenly in the aftermath of September 11, as we stopped our  outright activity for a few maintenance periods while currency growth remained robust.  Total RPs grew to more than $30 billion, and the long-term RP book reached  about $24 billion in October.  In that month we began to buy outrigh t for SOMA once again; and over the past five months, SOMA has expanded by over $25 billion, wh ich in absolute terms is about as aggressive a pace as we have ever sustai ned over any extended period.  But the rapid growth in currency has continue d to surprise us over the past several months, and the rapid pace of SOMA expansion still has not allowed us to bring down our holdings of RPs, including long-term RPs, below the October levels. Looking ahead, while currency growth is expected to moderate, we plan to maintain the recent rapid pace of SOMA expansion, which should allow us to  bring RPs, including long-term RPs, down modestly from the current levels. Again, though, we are talking about forecasts, and there is a lot of risk to those forecasts. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign opera tions in the intermeeting period.  I do want to mention that yesterday the Desk made its initial purchase of French bonds for SOMA’s foreign portfolio as part of our e ffort to diversify the Euro portfolio beyond German debt.  I will need a vote to ra tify domestic operations, and I would be happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. How do you read the Argentinean situation?  It seems to be going from one state of deteri oration to the next, w ith the clues largely being some form of confiscation of foreign assets. That leads me to conclude that it will be difficult to get anyone to reinvest in Argentina if its leader s continue to make it terribly obvious  that it’s not safe to do so.   how is this all going to unravel or ravel—I don’t know what the appropr iate term is—in your judgment?   MR. KOS. I think you’re absolutely right that there is a suppression of the exchange rate by the various rules and regulations, both formal  and informal, that are being applied.  How much that is suppressing the exchange rate is hard to quantify, and I w ouldn’t want to hazard a guess. But a lot of people in the analytical co mmunity think that we could see a further—and perhaps even sharp—depreciation if and when a more open market is allowed to develop.  As for how that will spill over into broader markets or the society, I think it’s very hard to guess.  But it’s difficult to be optimis tic about the situation. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  If I may interject, Mr. Ch airman?  I would note that the one-year forward rate yesterday was 4.8 pesos per dollar. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I was just abou t to mention that.  In other words, somebody is very pessimistic at this point.  Wh at in the world does a one-year forward of, say, 5 imply about the inflation rate?  We had the Braz ilian experience where we were all surprised at the lack of pass-through of  the exchange rate effects.  Do we have any evidence yet as to how this is materializing in the Argentine situation?  We do know that their inflation rate is rising, but is it rising with the implied full, moderate, or very little pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. There’s not enough economic activity going on in Argentina to know— even in domestic trading much less anything th at would involve the pur chase of imported goods and the reaction of wages or the pass-through or a ny of that.  Ironically, th e situation is so bad that it may be that what they really should do is  let the inflation rip because it would depreciate pay those debts underlies many of  their political problems.  I don’t know, frankly, anything to suggest to them.  If you sent me down there as the Czar of Argentina, I would not know how to fix the present situation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE

[SECTION]

ENSPAN.  Heaven forfend! 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  The IMF task force that was there has gone home.  They were subject to immense scrutiny in the Argentine press.  Ev en people on the street knew the names of those on the IMF task force, which is something that is very unusual.  The government in power now continues to blame others for their problems.  Th ey blame past IMF policies; they blame foreign lenders; they blame the foreign banks.  They bl ame anybody but themselves.  The public has lost confidence in most institutions.  It’s not clea r whether they’ve lost c onfidence in the central bank. But the central bank is in a very difficult position because if they try now to keep the inflation rate contained, then th is device of basically wiping th e slate clean and starting over by just letting the inflation rip won’ t happen.  And the political struggl e to fight over the crumbs that are left will continue. So in some respects, as outrageous as it may sound, it might be better if the central bank just looked the other way for a while. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. On second t hought, maybe we ought to send you down there! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Isn’t a lo t of the debt denominated in dollars? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Oh, it used to be. It isn’t a ny more.  By a stroke of the pen, they have “pesofied” virtually everything. They cannot do that to the debt they owe to foreigners because foreigners basically will just say “no.” 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE

[SECTION]

ENSPAN.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  If I could make a comment, Mr. Chairman?  Roger Ferguson and I attended a meeting of leading privat e-sector bankers and central bankers in Basel a couple of weeks ago. When the subject turned  to Argentina, it was the most fascinating experience I’ve ever had in that there was abso lute agreement between the public-sector and the private-sector participants.  All agreed that th e main issue was the grotesque violation of any concept of the rule of law by that which passes for a government in Argentina.  There was no pressure whatsoever from the private sector fo r a public-sector rescue package.  Rather, the contrary: We were being very strongly advised not to touch Argentina with a helping hand of any kind because of a new version of the contagion effect.  That is, if a country could in any way be rewarded for violating the law of contracts, it would enc ourage irresponsible governments elsewhere in the world to think th at they should do the same thing. So there is, I believe, a view that the present government of Arge ntina just has to be allowed to stew in its jui ce until and if it figures out a way to implement a program, which would include putting back in place the rule of law. And I think the ability of the present government to do that is  questionable.  I must say that, in my forty years of working on these types of pr oblems and working with Argentina, this is the most difficult situation I’ve ever seen. That ’s because not just Karen but nobody can figure out what to do. The Argentine people have a view that their politicians are eith er inept or corrupt or both, and by and large they are right.  Therefore, no one can qu ite figure out how Argentina can get out of this situation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Jerry.    present as was Ricardo Lopez-Murphy, who was th e Argentine Defense Minister and then for a couple of weeks the Minister of the Economy.  On the inflation question, Sebastian Edwards made some back-of-the-envelope calculations.  These numbers to me just sound off the wall, but he said it would take about a 3,000 pe rcent inflation in peso terms to get some sort of a balance.  I don’t know how he arrived at that figure, but  the numbers being talked about were just enormous.  Ricardo Lopez-Murphy’s point was that  the attitude in Argentina now is more like that in the French Revolution th an anything any nation has experien ced since then.  He said that in the mind of the average Argentinean, if you have  ever held political office in Argentina, you are not qualified to hold office. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC

[SECTION]

DONOU GH.  Sad stuff. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It’s not very encouraging.  Incidentally, on the currency issue, when we subtract out th e estimated change in dollars he ld by foreign holders, what have the domestic currency trends looked like  in the last two or three months? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. Actually, Mr. Chairman, it’ s a pretty easy calculation because foreign and domestic holdings seem to be growing at just about the same rate.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That doesn’t make  it an easy calculation.  It may just be wrong! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. As we estimated it, the growth rates were similar.  Looking at currency shipments in January, overseas and domesti c holdings were both growing at 12 percent.  In February it was about 8½ percent fo r overseas and 13 percent for domestic. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I assume $100 bills would move in pretty much the same way?  this number; we look at that and the data we get from currency shippers. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE

[SECTION]

ENSPAN.  Okay. A ny further questions?  If not— 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I move ap proval of the domestic operations. 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Second. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you. Wit hout objection, they are approved.  Dino you’re still on. You’re going to talk  about GNMAs (Ginnie Maes), right? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Yes. Don and I will make some brief opening comments on that topic.  At this point the staff has done a fair amount of background work on how we might go about acquiring for the System Open Market Account a portfolio of GNMAs and also on structuring a portfolio of RPs (repurchase agreements) against foreign sovereign securities.  Where we are now is that quite a bit more—in fact a substan tial amount—of rather nitty-gritty operational work needs to be done both to study and to prepare for an actual implementation of either program.  That then becomes a resource issue because a lot of the same people would work on both of these projects.  So there’s a competition for thos e resources between these two projects and also on the contingency-related issues. And that ju st makes it impossible for us to expedite the contingency planning work and also work on GNMAs and the foreign sovereign debt.  Therefore, we wanted to get some guidance fr om the Committee as to which one of the two options for the portfolio the Committee wanted us to focus on.  There are pros and cons for each, which we tried to lay out in the paper that was se nt to you.  As we noted in that memo, there are both tactical and strategi c questions that the Committee may wa nt to consider.  Don and I would be happy to answer any questions, bu t I won’t review the actual cont ents of that paper.  Don, did you want to say anything about some of the ot her topics on which staff work is being done? way. We have a study being done on the auctio n credit facility (ACF), which would be a discount window facility. Rick Lang from the Philadelphia Fed is heading that up and is following up on the various issues Committee member s raised when this subject was discussed about a year ago. There are issu es dealing with supervisory matte rs, risk management and asset management for the Federal Reserve System, and au ction design.  Those are at least three of the main topics being studied.  That work actua lly has been given a little extra impetus by contingency planning follow-up fr om September 11.  An ACF-like fa cility could function in an emergency as a backup for open market operations .  As a consequence of Governor Ferguson’s and Vice Chairman McDonough’s work on contingency planning and backup facilities for the System, we have given that ACF study a little mo re urgency.  Rick and his group are to have something done on that by June.  If they can’t get a complete study done on all aspects of the ACF, they are at least going to have finished by June the work on the use of a discount auction facility as a contingency backup for open market operations.  But Rick is  going to try to move along all the tracks so that we can have everythi ng regarding the ACF ready for consideration at that time. A second project is the review of the SOMA studies that you looked at a year ago.  Each one has been reviewed by legal st aff both here and at the New York Fed, I believe.  For the most part, they have also been through the economic ed iting process to get them ready for publication, and the authors themselves have reviewed that wo rk.  I think it’s fair to say that the urgency behind this project has toned dow n a bit.  But we are moving forward to get those studies in publishable form and to get them out to the publi c as staff studies, not as Committee documents.  most difficult option in terms of the bridge necessa ry to get political and public acceptability is the use of foreign debt obligations. Unless someone  has a differing view, it seems to me that we can certainly proceed with the Ginnie Maes before we can go forward with the foreign sovereign debt option. I don’t know whether or  not that’s a consensus view. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MC

[SECTION]

DONOUGH.  I agree fully. And New York wouId have the staff do them both after we have finished the contingency work. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. President Broaddus. MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, if I could ju st make a couple of comments here.  I certainly think these studies are useful and worthwh ile.  If we get to the point that we don’t have enough Treasury securities out ther e to do our job, it’s going to be  helpful to have done these studies and given some thought to these alternatives in advance.  So I consider it a useful exercise. But I do have problems with both of the alternatives that are before us this morning.  I agree with what you just said about  using foreign government securiti es as collateral for repos.  I think that could be very politic ally sensitive and this is at a time when we’re trying to put together and maintain a coalition to  fight terrorism around the world.   The Ginnie Mae option may seem better at first glance, even taking a ccount of the size of the market and questions about liquidity and whatnot.  After all, they do carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  But when I think a bout it, that may not be all that helpful in some sense. The loans we made a number of years ago to Chrysler and to Lockheed also carried the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  It worries me that we might set up a precedent or convey the idea by dealing in GNMAs that in some  sense full faith and credit is a sufficient condition to hold securities or other kinds of assets in our SOMA portfolio.  If that is the message comes down the road, we might have to say yea or  nay as to whether we’re going to hold that particular asset. I can imagine that that could put us in an uncomfortable position.  Moreover, buying GNMAs themselves would pose problems.  If we’re willing to buy securities that support housing, then someone is going to ask why shouldn’t we buy securities to support some other activity that the government thinks is worthy of the full faith and credit designation. Now, one might ask, Well, if the Tr easury is willing to make that designation, why should we be worried about it? But to me, in this situation, perception is reality.  If we’re perceived as being a part of some  sectoral credit-allocation process,  then in my view that could be problematic for us, and I think we ought to avoid that.  So I come back to something I tried to sell a while ago and didn’t have much luck.  My suggestion is that we find a way—or at least disc uss with the Treasury the possibility of finding a way—for them to increase the supply of Treasury secu rities for us to purchase if that need arises.  I know this is a tough sell. But we’re doing all these studies of other options, many of which—or perhaps all of which—arguably are not all that attractive.  So I just wonder if we couldn’t spend a little time and effort to try to talk with Pe ter Fisher or whoever is  the right person at the Treasury to explore whether this co ncept might be feasible.  I just throw that out as a suggestion.  This will probably be my last speech about this , but I really have pr oblems with these other options. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, I think we all have problems with them.  They are not options we have chosen to implement over th e years, and the reasons are largely the issues that you’ve raised.  These are fallback positions “in the event that.”  And the “that” may not emerge, judging from the most recent fiscal policy stances.  So it may be a moot question.  But I  of not currently acceptable SOMA investments, which is the least worst. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. All I’m asking is that this  one other option be put on the plate and given some time and consideration.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Can we have comme nts on that?  I’m just curious to hear, say, Dino and Don’s comments on that issue. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think there are a couple of i ssues involved, if I can dredge them up from my memory of our previous discussion.  Part of the question was what  the Treasury would do with the other part of its balance sheet. In e ffect, we’d be pushing the problem on to them.  That buy our securities in the open market.  So this is a question of the Tr easury’s issuing more securities into the open market  to accommodate our needs and then doing something with the cash that they raise. They would need to figur e out how to invest the extra cash that they’re raising in order to sell the securities in the open market or we, in addition to the Treasury, would need to go to the Congress to seek a change in the law. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Well, I’m sure there are challenges and issues and mechanical questions to deal with. But that is the case with all of these othe r options.  All I’m saying is that I hate to see this possibility get dismissed pretty much out of hand. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Suppose they in vested the cash in common stock, would you be appreciative of that? 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Well, that’s  their business, I guess. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Mr. Chairman, working with Al and his people, we can certainly produce a short paper on this topic. Marvin Goodfriend an d I had a debate about it at the Cleveland Fed  that would be helpful. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE

[SECTION]

ENSPAN.  Okay. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I have a question, and it’s purely a question.  Given that  there has been some discussion about the condition of FNMA (Fannie Mae) and FMAC (Freddie Mac), would a visible program to make possibl e investment in GNMA securities raise issues about why we are not investing in those of Fannie and Freddie?  Would there be a possible adverse market reaction as a consequence?  This is along the same lines as Al’s question.  If we ’re getting involved in housing, why not invest in Fannies and Freddies?  I’m also thinki ng about the riskiness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—the very low capital  ratios that those firms maintain. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. We take Fannies and Freddies in  RPs.  This option would involve outright purchases of GNMAs, so we would be treating th em differently.  I thi nk we would explain the difference as a full faith and credit issue.  Part  of the idea for moving to GNMA was that the Committee seemed not to want to increase its re liance on Fannie and Freddie.  And one of the instructions to the staff was to look for other alternatives that are legal under the current Federal Reserve Act. That’s how these alternatives cam e up.  So I think the signal you’re seeing is an accurate representation of where the Committee wanted to go. If I could make one more point, going back  to the question you asked about currency growth, Mr. Chairman.  Currency has been growing about 8 percent a year; this year it’s been running more like 10, 11, 12 percent.  The deficit would have to be $250 billion or $300 billion for us not to be taking an increa sing portion of the securities ou tstanding.  So even without the adverse deficit kinds of scenarios that people se e, if currency growth doesn’t decelerate soon, the Fed will start to own a rising proportion of the Tr easury securities outstanding in a market where   on this. But even under the most likely scenarios of de ficits persisting at a relatively low level for some time, I think the Committee is going to face a problem where its operations are impinging on the liquidity of the market before too long. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE

[SECTION]

ENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My issue was similar to Bill Poole’s.  I’m concerned about getting involved with GNMAs because of what that may lead to with regard to the pressure to make outright purchases of  Fa nnies and Freddies, which I think would be a huge mistake.  So despite all the imperfections, if I ha d to vote, I would vote in  favor of looking at the foreign RP pool first. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan. MR. JORDAN. Thank you. First, Al’s commen t about his last speech on this subject reminds me of a story from tw enty-odd years ago in the banki ng industry.  The question from one banker would be, “Have you seen Sandy Rose’s last article on duration?”  And the response would be, “I hope so!” [Laughter] This story does relate to GNMAs because I was opposed to dabbling around with them even before I read  Sandy and Brian’s memo, and they thoroughly convinced me that it is a bad idea.  In addition to  prepayment risk, which is adequately treated in the memo, there is also the risk of shorte ning duration and revaluat ion in a rising rate environment.  I also think there is the issue of  how we would subsequently distinguish between them and GSEs.  So my first option might be, other things held aside, to table this whole issue.  That is probably not realistic in view of the le ngth of time it will take to come up with a viable alternative if necessary.  I do th ink a connection ultimately needs to  be made between what is on the liability side of our balan ce sheet, in terms of where and ho w it’s held, and what is on the exploring the use of repos in foreign-denominated currencies.  I think that’s a sensible thing to think about for a long-term perspective. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GRE

[SECTION]

ENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I think we’re all going on me mory here.  First, I would say that I don’t have a particular preferen ce for foreign RPs versus Ginnie Maes; I could go either way.  But on the Ginnie versus Fannie/Fre ddie issue, I believe the distinct ion is that at one point Fannie and Freddie were explicitly priv atized.  They were supposedly taken out of the government and were not supposed to receive any public subsi dy.  So we are adhering to that line.  That privatization decision, as I understand it, was not made for GNMA.  So I see a clear distinction there. One might argue that there are going to be pressures, and that may be so.  But I think that argument could be turned around a bit to say that, if we explicitly operated in Ginnies and not Fannies and gave the reason, it might actually clar ify the distinction between what is supposedly privatized and what is not. The last point is on Al’s idea of talking to Pete r Fisher.  I’d be happy for us to have a conversation with Peter Fisher. But even though Peter is wonderful, he’s not a magician.  The only way the Treasury could issue us  more securities or put more securities out in the market for us to buy is for them to run deficits or buy assets.  And I don’t find either option attractive. We can have a paper on this, but what  else is it going to sa y?  So I guess, Al, I do hope that this is the last conversat ion we have about that!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Well, they don’t just have  to buy assets.  They can always reduce taxes. This doesn’t co nstrain fiscal policy.  

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  But that means a deficit.  That’s the deficit option. Whatever you think about deficits, I believe that  ought to be part of an overall fiscal strategy.  And I don’t want  improvement in monetary policy.  I just don’t think it’s worth that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I guess we ought to buy the Washington Senators! 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Or the Treasury could buy them  and issue us a security.  [Laughter] That I might go along with! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO. I believe there’s no easy answ er to the question that is being raised by the Desk. If we look at the data on outstandings, that should be obvious.  Once one moves away from Treasuries, what’s left are corporat es, agencies, mortgage-based paper of various kinds, and foreign securities—or at least fore ign sovereign debt base d assets.  Municipal securities were never a real alte rnative, given the limited size and depth of that market.  If we eschew credit risk and we shy away from GSEs, we’re left with Ginnies  and foreign sovereign debt based assets. The staff has laid out the right issues here. Maintaining a GNMA portfolio is work that invo lves special skills.  These skills aren’t difficult to find, nor are they difficult for the Desk  to acquire.  The Desk could, in fact, maintain a portfolio of mortgage-backed instruments.  The industry that we regulate  has thousands of its members engaged in that activity as we speak, and given that our interest is limited to portfolio investment rather than trading, it’s really pret ty simple to accomplish.  Alternatively, shifting to dollar RPs against foreign sovereign securities would appear to be an easier option.  The Desk is already involved in RP transact ions, and so allowing sovereign co llateral seems like an easy step. From a conceptual point of view this is corr ect.  However, as the staff memo indicates, the market for cross-currency repos is currently qu ite small.  We in essence would need to create a market or, as the memo states, create a more vibrant market out of one that is indeed quite whose sovereign debt was acceptable to serve as collateral in transacti ons with the Federal Reserve. And we’d have to maintain such a li st.  More to the point, we would have to be prepared to remove from our list a country whose fundamental creditworthiness had changed substantially. This would be awkward at best and potentially politically difficult.  Second, it’s not at all clear to me that the Federal Reserve shou ld be placed in the role of market creator.  We  currently worry, appropri ately, about disrupting markets with  our trades.  Why should we be willing to create new markets?  Clearly, if the De sk indicated that it would be trading in such cross-currency instruments, the market would de velop.  But this would change spreads and alter the status quo in uncertain ways. I’m not sure th at this is an appropriate role for the Federal Reserve to play in world capital markets.   In fact, I more or less come to the conclu sion that maybe we shoul d slow this effort down. I hesitate to say this. It took us almost a year to get to this point.  But the Treasury seems to have shifted its spending ou tlook, as we indicated, and maybe not enough by the back-of-the­envelope calculations. But at least at the moment that has gi ven us some breathing room.  And as was mentioned at the outset, th e auction credit facility seems to have some promise if we in fact proceed with it.  If we must act, I guess I’ d favor the GNMAs.  And as a side bar, there are lots of MBAs out there who would be happy to r un that portfolio for us.  Given the weakness in the labor market, there are probably plenty avai lable at the moment.  Those are my comments. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I associate myself very substantially with what President Santomero has just said.  I think the GNMAs are preferable to the repos with forei gn sovereign debt collateral for the reasons that he cited.  I also on this issue have been working flat out since September 11, and they were working pretty hard before that. So I think the first order of business really is th at they finish the work on the contingency issues and relax on all of this othe r material until then, which would probably be a matter of, say, three to six months.  At that poin t I think they should conc entrate their efforts on GNMAs. I agree that management of GNMAs would be somewhat more complicated than managing what is in the portfolio now, but it is certainly doable.  As Pr esident Santomero said, many firms that we supervise do that sort of work very extensively.   I also believe that we have to avoid getting in to the situation of saying that we will decide which securities are acceptable if  they have the full faith and cr edit of the government of the United States. If the Congress and the President d ecide that an instrument  has the government’s full faith and credit, it is not al together clear to me that, as a creature of the Congress and as an independent central bank, we should second-guess that  decision.  It isn’t at all clear to me what would give us the authority to decide—to make the highly political judgment—that pure Treasuries are okay but GNMAs or something else are not.  It is nice that we  have been able to deal with pure Treasuries until now.  As Don Kohn points out very well, even if deficits continue, the trends are such that  we’re going to have to make us e of securities other than pure Treasuries. I think what the Congr ess and the President decide has the full faith and credit of the United States is clearly the right place to go. A nd if they decide that some other kind of credit has the full faith and credit of the United Stat es, we may have to go there, too.  Thank you.

I must associate myself with the vi ews of President Santomero and Vice Chairman sooner rather than later. It’s t oo easy as time goes by to let things slide.  The further we get away from a tragedy in this case, the ea sier it is to forget about all the bells and whistles that need to be included so that we can react in a timely way if , God forbid, something else happens.  Let’s get that work done and then work on these other issues in the future.

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be  the fourth in a row, so I’ll be even briefer than President Minehan and say th at I agree with what Tony Santomero, Bill McDonough, and Cathy Minehan have just said.  Particularly si nce my name is somewhat associated with this contingency planning, I don’t want anything to stand in the way of getting that done. We’d be extraordinarily embarrasse d if we had to implement some sort of contingency arrangements and discovered that they weren’t ready.  While these other issues are extremely important and I think we should get back  to them, I really do believe from a national interest standpoint that ge tting the contingency planning done is of  primary interest at this stage.

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, if my memory se rves me right, I think the last time we talked about this I favored as a “least worst” c hoice going with the Ginnies before going with the foreign sovereign debt. But I have a lot of symp athy for what Al said regarding the downside of the Ginnies. Nevertheless, I still would go in that  direction.  The one thing that I am concerned about relates to the type of problems that often arise by going ahead piecemeal on something.  What I’d like to do is to hold off as long as possible and take a look at all the options again, of these options together in context.  By then  perhaps the ACF will be further along and we can    Ginnies and build in that directi on only to find that they may not be the best choice in the long run and then try to back out of using them. Other than that, I agree that our work on contingencies has to come first and that we can put this off until that is done, knowing what our risks are and knowing what our leas t worst choice is after that.

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, in spite of their shortcomings as well as  their advantages, I think that both alternatives, as well as the ACF, are probably going to have to be arrows in the quiver for SOMA at some point.  So at some tim e in the future, certainl y after the contingency studies are completed, I think we  ought to proceed.  It’s not immediately obvious to me which option should be addressed first. I would say, though, that the experien ce of the last year certainly indicates to us that thi ngs can change very dramatically in terms of the fiscal position of the U.S. government as well as what we’re seeing  with regard to curr ency.  I don’t know how cautious we should be. I think we ought to move  with good dispatch or ag gressively after we’ve dealt with the contingency issues. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES. I agree with what President Sant omero said.  I am very concerned, and my biggest concern is creating liqui dity in a foreign market inst rument.  From a public policy perspective, when there are liquidity issues in U.S. markets, I think we’d have a real problem answering the question of why we chose to build liqui dity in a market for foreign securities.  I do believe that the priority should be on the cont ingency planning, though.  We pray that nothing else like September 11 happens again.  But with  what is going on in the Middle East, I don’t concern, and I would feel strongly about putting that at the top of the list.

ENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I agree with what seems to be an emerging consensus that we do the contingency planning first and also with what Tony Santomero, Bill McDonough, and others have said. I just want to reiterate the point th at Bill McDonough made.  If the Congress designates certain securi ties as having the full faith and credit of the United States— whether they are GNMAs or securities issued  in another Chrysler -type bailout—it’s not appropriate for us to distinguish among those securities.  Even though we personally may not like the idea of subsidizing one sector or one firm, it is not our role to make such a distinction.  It really is a congressional decisi on.  So I would favor going in that direction.  I also happen to agree with the point that Ned made about trying to draw a distinction between Fannie and Freddie on the one hand and GNMA on the other. If  we ever got to the point where we were purchasing GNMA securities but we made it very clear that we were not  purchasing those of Fannie and Freddie, I think that might help ed ucate the public a little more on this issue. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think it’s important  to point out that most of the credit allocation effect occurs with th e issuance of the full faith and cr edit securities, not with their purchase. It’s not a question of  whether the Fed or somebody else holds them; that is probably worth a couple of basis points at most.  The ma jor issue is clearly the designation, for whatever reason, of full faith and credit. So it’s the Treasu ry that is making the crucial decision.  What we do with respect to which of those various assets we hold is a very secondary question.  There is an issue of principle here, and I think that is something we ha ve to keep in mind.  But as a practical matter, I’m not sure it matters all that much.  I don’t believe, for example, that if we had    who is making the policy decision—whether we do it or the Treasury does it and so forth.  President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, just to complete the go-around, let me associate myself with those who have a preference for the GNMAs as  opposed to the foreign de bt alternative.  My staff tells me that we’d be smart in the short run to concentrate on repos, even with Ginnies.  Apparently there are some rather difficult accounting issues that n eed to be explored as far as outright purchases are concerned. So I would put myself in the same camp as others who have taken that position. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. We already do repos in Ginnies. MR. GUYNN. I assume that we could do more, as the first cut—do more repos before we do outright purchases. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. MR. MCTEER. I would associate myself with Presidents Santomero, McDonough, and others in wanting to complete the contingenc y work first and preferring GNMAs over foreign debt. I doubt that we’re ever going to need to  do this, but maybe we could also buy time by lowering reserve requirements at some point so that the amount of securities in the portfolio will be reduced. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That would ge t somebody’s attention, I’m sure.  Does anybody else want to comment on this? MR. KOS. Just two brief points. On the que stion of other assets that have the full faith and credit designation, there is the credit issue and then there’s th e liquidity issue.  So, as we  but it might not meet our liquidity screen because not enough of that issue is outstanding.  So we wouldn’t necessarily automatically be in the posture of buying that asset.  On President Santomero’s point with respect to the foreign sovereign debt and which countries would be included in the collateral basket, just to be up front I should note that we are in that posture now with our foreign portfolio, where we do maintain  a book of euro-denominated repos.  At present we take securities of six countries  from the euro area that meet our  credit and liquidity screens.  So we are in that posture now, although it’s not as prominent because it is a small portion of our portfolio. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let me request that  Don Kohn review the transcript of the discussion we’ve just had. I think it’s fairly ev ident that the contingency planning has first and immediate priority and that there is a mixture of views beyond that.  Also, I want to emphasize that this is not an issue on which those who ar e voting members of the FOMC at this particular meeting should carry the day because this is a mu ch broader question.  So I suggest that you look at the full Committee and make judgments accordingly, Don, and if necessa ry get clarification from the members.  Then I would ask that you report your findings to Dino Kos so he will have some answers to his question.  Those answers, I trust, will be somewhat less ambiguous than what I heard at the table this morning.  I think it was a useful discussion, and implicit in what has been said are some useful insights as to wh at the next step should be.  Unless somebody has anything further to say on this issue, I will call on David Stockton and Karen Johnson. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Thank you. I noted w ith some considerable relief the Chairman’s remarks at Larry Meyer’s going-away dinner in January in which he equated the making of mistakes with the le arning experience.  While I don’t think I would classify the revisions we have made to our forecast as correcting mistakes, I can safely report to the Committee that the staff did have several major learning experiences over the intermeeting period.  I thought that perhaps I could review this       forecast going forward. Lesson 1: Ask the right question.   You may recall that in December, in defense of our forecast of an upturn in activity this spring, I reported asking the research staff whether there had been any instances of recessions that  had failed to end.  I now realize that I should have asked the admittedly somewhat more metaphysical question:  Are there any examples of recessi ons that failed to begin?  [Laughter] In understanding how things have turned out so much better than our earlier expectations, there is an important ques tion about what kind of cycle we have experienced.  One reasonably reliable characteristic of business cycle downturns is that many things tend to go bad simultaneousl y.  In the context of our models, this shows through as a correlati on in the errors across spending equations during periods of recession—many categories of spending fa ll short of the fundamentals for a time.  It is precisely this synchronicity of errors that leads to the nonlinearities we associate with recessions. As you know, we had built that feature into our forecast—to a small degree through much of last year and in a more significant manner last fall.  In the event, those correlations ha ve largely been absent. To be sure, the pronounced downturn in spending and profits  in the business sector led to weaker growth  of employment and income.  Spending in the household sector slowed in response to these devel opments but no more than would have been suggested by the fundamentals.  If anything, there appear to have been small positive surprises in our consumption equations over the past few months.  Purchases of light motor vehicles remain at elevated levels, even though they have retraced some of the extraordinary spike seen last year.  And real PCE outside of motor vehicles advanced at a 2¼ percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, when unemployment was rising sharply, and appears poised to increase at a pace of nearly 5½ percent this quarter.  Similarly, housing constructi on only edged down last fall and has moved up smartly early this year, only in part be cause of favorable weather.  This surprising strength in the household sector has combined with an earlier end to declining equipment investment and a tapering-off of inventory liquidation to produce a greater pickup in activity than we had earlier anticipated.  We have revised up our forecast for the growth of real output in the first half of th is year from a 2 percent pace in our January forecast to a rate of more than 3½ percent in the current projection. Lesson 2: When it comes to forecas ting productivity, use your imagination not your models.  Starting late last year and into  early this year, we were almost continually surprised by the strength in domestic spending.  But given the extraordinary weakness in employment a nd hours worked, we significantly tempered the effect of those stronger spending data  on our forecast of GDP.  With readings on inventories and international trade yet to come, we thought strong domestic demand was probably being supplied out of inventor ies or from rising imports, rather than from increased domestic production.  In fact , we viewed our January forecast of 2¾ percent at an annual rate fo r the growth in out put per hour in the fourth quarter to be a bold one for a period of purporte d recession.  Obviously, we showed a     annual rate of about 5¼ percent in the fi nal quarter of 2001.  And with the latest available data evidencing a similar pattern  of strong expenditures and weak hours, our current-quarter projection of growth in re al GDP of about 4 percent implies a still stronger increase in productiv ity of about 5¾ percent. So what do we make of these readings on productiv ity?  No doubt, there is a significant amount of statistical noise, as th ere always is, and thus ample reason to discount these figures. However, there also may be some economic reasons why productivity has turned in such a strong perf ormance of late.  For one, we weren’t the only ones surprised by the strength of fina l demand over the past four months.  Businesses responded swiftly and aggressive ly to the events of September 11 by cutting payrolls on the expect ation that a slump in demand would soon follow.  But, with a few exceptions, a sharp pullback in spending never materialized.  In order to meet better-than-expected demand, firms appear  simply to have squeezed more out of their existing workforces. Caution on the pa rt of businesses still appears to be in evidence. The pace of hiring has remained subdued, and many business people continue to express concern about the outl ook.  If our interpreta tion is correct, firms should begin to hire more vigorously as th ey gain confidence in the staying power and strength of the expansion. We think th at process will be gradual, but in the months ahead we expect businesses to increase hours worked more rapidly by lengthening workweeks and adding workers.  As hiring catches up over the next couple of quarters to the improvement in pr oduction, growth in labor productivity is projected to drop back noticeably. We also believe, however, that ther e has been some signal about underlying productivity in the recent data.  We boosted our estimate of the growth of structural labor productivity 0.1 percentage point this year and 0.3 percentage point next year reflecting both these recent readings a nd the improved outlook for capital spending.  Given the enormous increases we have seen, th ere is certainly some risk that we have underreacted to the news about productivity, much as we did during the second half of the 1990s. As we illustrated in a Gr eenbook simulation, if productivity were to turn out stronger than in our forecast, grow th of real GDP would be higher as would corporate profits, and inflation would come in lower.  Faster productivity growth probably helps to explain some of the st rength in demand over the past year; the fundamentals were better than we had recognized.  Going forward, more-rapid growth of productivity provides a lift to expe cted income gains, with consequences for current spending, especially on durable goods and housing.  Thus, these favorable supply-side developments pr ovided another reason for re vising up our forecast this round. Lesson 3: With regard to fiscal policy, quit while you’re ahead. Over the past thirty years, economists have typically cau tioned against the use of activist fiscal policy as a countercyclical tool. The prin cipal shortcoming cited is that it often comes too late and ends up being procyclical  rather than countercyclical.  The tax cuts enacted last year, however, provide d a nice counter-example.  We believe the        provided important support to  household spending in the se cond half of the year.  Moreover, we expected already enacted legislation—both the second installment of tax reductions and a further step-up in sp ending—to provide another boost to activity this year. As you no doubt recall, we had built a fiscal stimulus package into our forecast last fall when employment was collapsi ng and unemployment was rising steeply.  Two key features of that package were extended unemployment insurance benefits and a partial-expensing provision for investment.  We then  significantly scaled back that package in January, most notably rem oving the investment incentive, when the economy was showing more convincing signs  of a rebound and political gridlock appeared to set in. Well, as our luck w ould have it, the recently enacted stimulus package was very similar to that which we ha d incorporated in our forecast last fall.  Given the uncertainty that still surrounds the durability and strength of the upturn, reasonable people could come to differen t conclusions about the advisability of enacting a stimulus package at this point.  But viewed from the perspective of our baseline forecast, this package provides a modest positive shove to an economy that would otherwise already have been growing somewhat above trend. Lesson 4: Monetary policy still works with long and variable lags.  As you know, we have argued quite strongly over the past  year that monetary policy has been and will be effective.  By our assessment, easier monetary policy was leaning against substantial drags from the collapse of i nvestment, the weaker stock market, and the stronger dollar. With real interest rates well below estimated equilibrium rates, we thought monetary policy was positioned to encourage a rebound in activity.  That now appears to have occurred sooner and with gr eater vigor than we had projected.  As a consequence, we are assuming a steeper upwar d trajectory for the federal funds rate in this projection than in our previous one.  We have penciled in an increase in the funds rate to 4 percent by the end of 2003—100 basis points above our January forecast. This upward adjustment reflects two factors.  Firs t, stronger underlying demand and faster growth of structural pr oductivity have boosted our estimate of the equilibrium real rate.  Second, with a smaller output gap and a higher path for inflation, the cyclical component of m onetary policy does not need to be as accommodative as in our previous forecast.  Under our baseline, some additional tightening would probably be required in 2004 to prevent the economy from overshooting. Lesson 5: As the education experts ofte n remind us, learning is a lifetime process. There is little reason to exp ect that our learning experiences are behind us.  As a consequence, it is probably useful to consider where we could be going wrong.  We see significant risks on both  sides of this projection.  One immediate upside risk concerns the behavior of inve ntories.  We have only one month of inventory data for the first quarter, and the figures for that m onth were stronger than we expected.  Even after this morning’s trade data, which Kare n will be discussing shortly, we’ll need to see much greater liquidation outside the auto sector in coming months to get our       reflection of a drop-off in the pace of liquidation or even some re-stocking.  That firmness in prices, by lowering the carrying co st of inventories, could also provide some incentive for a more rapid turnaround in  the inventory cycle.  This would, in turn, provide greater upward  impetus to activity, with  knock-on effects on production, sales, and spending that coul d give the economy an even greater head of steam, at least for a time.  There are some clear downside risks as well.  We have made a large change to our projection on the basis of just seven weeks of data.  And business attitudes don’t seem to have improved as much as the economic statistics.  Business people apparently don’t see the subs tantial turnaround in corporate profits expected by equity analysts.  Even assuming that those rosier pr ofits come to pass, equity valuations still look rich by any historical standard other th an that of recent years.  The upturn in capital spending isn’t a sure thing yet eith er.  The improvement in computer outlays looks to be on reasonably firm ground at th is point, but spending for some other types of capital equipment is just now bottoming out and, in a few cases, outlays are still heading lower.  Finally, if the recent st rength in productivity is all noise and no signal, we have marked up our GDP forecast t oo much.  All in all, the uncertainties in the outlook remain very large.  But they now appear to be centered on outcomes that, for the most part, are much better than we  could have hoped for not  all that long ago.  Karen. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  This morning the trade data for January have just been released.  These data show a deficit of $28.5 billion, somewhat wider than in December and than we had incorporated in the Greenbook baseline.  Compared with the revised terms, these data on balance do not suggest  any significant change to the staff’s outlook for growth in the first quarter, as th e slightly lowe r real net exports than we were expecting in the Greenbook might easily be offset by a small change in our forecast for inventories. In line with the positive shift in the outlook for the U.S. economy in the Greenbook, our forecast for real GDP growth  abroad has also been revised up, particularly in the near term.  Indeed, to  a considerable extent, the more favorable outlook for the rest of the world reflects th e more buoyant attitude toward current and prospective activity in the Un ited States.  Our optimism, however, is also grounded in information we have recently received about  developments in the economies of some of our foreign trading partners plus our expectation that significant monetary ease already in place abroad w ill stimulate those economies.  A rebound in economic activity has come firs t and most clearly to the emer ging-market economies of Asia.  This development appears to reflect the start of a turn around in the global semiconductor industry and the related electr onics sector.  Pro duction data for the fourth quarter and those indicators that we have in hand for the current quarter confirm that strong gains have been made  in those economies that are intensive         moderate growth in this region over the forecast period; but we look for domestic demand to recover as well.  Strong growth of  real GDP is projected to continue in China, supported by continued strength in domestic demand and positive developments on the external front. For the major foreign industrial countrie s the picture is more mixed.  We have already been positively surprised by the streng th of production in the fourth quarter in Canada. Of course, the Canadian econo my should benefit substantially from the projected U.S. recovery; but we also expect that strong domestic sectors within that economy and the lagged effects of 375 basi s points of past monetary policy easing there will be important factor s in an acceleration of econo mic activity going forward.  For the euro area, the fourth quarter on aver age was one of contra ction in real GDP.  Although there are signs of improved confidence and increasing production in some countries, we remain cautious about the speed with which recovery will occur and so have forecast a gradual return to growth at  an annual rate of about 2½ percent in the second half of this year and near 3 percent next year.  A more r obust global expansion should be good for exports from the euro ar ea, but recovery is likely to boost import growth as well. On balance, we look for domestic demand to grow slightly more rapidly than output durin g this year and next. The Japanese economy is once again an exception to the pattern of growth that we see for most of the global economy.  To be sure, there have been some positive signs of late. Improved prospects for the rest of the world do imply a better outlook for Japanese export industries, part icularly those in the high-tech sector.  And the serious collapse of the financial system that some ha d feared as the end of the current fiscal year approaches now seems unlikely.  Thes e developments appear to lie behind the rather dramatic appreciation in some Japanese  asset prices that has occurred in recent weeks. But worrisome offsetting factors remain.  The banking system still has not resolved its nonperforming loan problem, and its true capital structure is dangerously weak. The inspections now being conducted by the Financial Services Agency will likely refocus attention on these problems once their results are released.  Total bankruptcies continue to rise. Domestic demand and recent production indicators show further contraction. Accordingly, we have again written down a forecast of further declines in GDP during most of this year and only weak grow th thereafter.  In such an environment, deflation should pers ist throughout the forecas t period in Japan. We have struggled to assess the risk s now confronting our Latin American trading partners.  Our best judgment currently is that financial markets will continue to distinguish among those countries, partic ularly in regarding Mexico as more closely tied to the United Stat es and Canada than to its Latin neighbors.  We expect that the projected recovery in U.S. ma nufacturing will provide stimulus to the Mexican economy and that we will see a moderately strong turnaround in that economy this year.  We also expect positive growth to return to Brazil, but the risks there are greater and the ties to the U.S.  economy are weaker.  For Argentina, we have projected further sharp declines in output this quarter and for the subsequent           Argentina’s problems are as much political as economic, and the resolution of those problems is not yet in sight.  Moreover, th ere are additional risk s to political and economic stability in other South Americ an countries, such as Venezuela and Colombia.  The direct effects on the U.S. economy of developments in South America are not likely to be large, but a clear  downside risk to our  forecast is that these problems might result in greater turmo il on international financial markets than we now envisage. I should add, however, that developments in  global oil markets could have substantial effects on the U. S. economy, and oil prices have moved up noticeably over the intermeeting period.  Additional instability in Venezuela could add to the forces putting upw ard pressure on oil prices. With the stronger outlook for the U.S. recovery operating as the driving force behind greater optimism about the global ec onomy, it may seem surprising that in recent days the dollar has come off its highs of  late February.  In part the explanation is a stronger yen, which is due to some factor s that are likely to pr ove transitory given the unresolved problems in that economy.  Indeed, yesterday we saw some retracing by the yen. But in part the move down in the dollar may also reflect some further attention by market participants to the U.S.  external deficits and the controversy over trade policy and the Administration’s positi on with respect to the “strong dollar” policy. With the dollar at a very high leve l and an expansionary cycle set to begin, during which the United States is widely e xpected to grow more rapidly than our trading partners for some time, the outlook is  for widening U.S. external deficits.  At some point, the rising mountain of debt created by those deficits may lessen the appetite of global investors for dollar-denom inated assets.  The baseline combination of stronger U.S. growth and tightening by th e FOMC suggests some upside risk to the dollar that is offset in our minds by the possible reaction of investors to the return to ever-widening U.S. trade deficits.  It is this  thought that has led us to incorporate in the forecast the projection of a stable  exchange value for the dollar. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. First, I was just curious, David, in your hypothesis that the sharp rise in productivity is a function of compan ies being blindsided to an unexpected rise in output or sales, have you taken a look at data for individual industries?  I ask because this hypothesis is somewhat testable in the sense that one would expect  the companies that experienced the sharpest increase in sales or output also to be in those industries where productivity suddenly accelerated. Has anyone looked at that?  I realize it ’s very difficult to do with our industrial production data because th at’s begging the question;  we are assuming output per hour. But do we have any collateral evidence?  because we actually get timely information on i ndustry data would be in  industrial production.  But since a significant chunk of that index takes labor input and makes an assumption about labor productivity, that wouldn’t be a very fruitful way of goi ng about answering your question.  For the rest of the economy, we get annual information in the gross product originating data— which would allow us to look at that—only with a considerable lag.  Now, one thing we have noticed over the last six months  or so is that productivity in  areas where we have physical product data has been a little  better than we initially estimated based on assumed labor productivity. So there’s a littl e evidence.  We do not get those data with high frequency, and they don’t explain the fourth and first quarters.  But I think they  perhaps suggest that something has been going on over the last year that has been better th an we expected.

ENSPAN.  Does the fact that initial claims seem, at least temporarily, to have stagnated at a weekly level around 400,000 suggest that the type of rises in payroll employment and in hours that ar e required to bring the growth in output per hour down may not be happening? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I think it would be too early to say because so far the initial claims have been running more in the 385,000 area than the 400,000 area. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I thought our data had them a little higher, but

MR. STOCKTON. I think the mid to high 380s was where our seasonals were suggesting that claims were li ned up reasonably well with the pa yroll employment growth.  For our forecast of payroll employment, which s hows a gradual acceleration to about 200,000 a    months.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Thank you. Karen, in Japan one hears a great deal about the amount and speed with which manufacturi ng is being moved to other pa rts of Asia where costs are significantly lower, particularly in  the high-tech sector.  Does th at suggest that this outsourcing of manufacturing in Japan will lead  to a different response on the part of Japan to growth in other parts of the world?  Will Japan perhaps not experience quite as much strength as has been the case in the past when economic activ ity picked up throughout the world? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  It’s certainly true that  outsourcing has become a much-discussed phenomenon in Japan.  And many of the foreign dire ct investment flows into  Asia arise in Japan because Japan is still running a si zable current account surplus.  It has funds that need to be invested, and that goes hand-in-h and with Japan’s strategy to do more of the manufacturing in lower-cost places.  So in some sense I think the an swer to your question is “yes.”  The Japanese economy for some time has not reacted to its export  sector the way it did, say, back in the 1970s.  Many people would still argue th at, given the conditi on of the Japanese economy, a falling yen and a consequent easing of Japan’s deflation pres sures, on the one hand, and a boost to its export sector, on the other, constitute the only salva tion that they can envision for the Japanese economy.  So I think it’s a question of degree. Ye s, it is perhaps less than  it was some time ago.   in Japan to get the rest of the economy going.  Therefore, I think many people would anticipate that we will see strengthening abroad turn into the difference between furt her contraction versus very slow growth—not a boom by any means but at least a difference of that much—in the Japanese economy. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. It may be that the currency w ould have to move more to accomplish the same amount of stimulus. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  True. It’s certainly possibl e.  But for example, the components that we’ve written down behind the scene so to speak—which give us a forecast of very low growth in 2003 rather than the contraction that we’ve projected for 2002—ha ve to do with a combination of inventories plus exports working in that direction to ge t the Japanese economy to stop contracting.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I have a question for Davi d on the longer-term outlook for inflation, beyond the actual forecast period. I’m looking at the baseline scenario an d thinking about where the economy will be at the end of 2003.  We will ha ve had a year of 4 percent real GDP growth; the economy would be growing beyond potential.  Th e output gap is eliminated at that point, and the unemployment rate is at 5.3 percent, whic h is your estimate of the NAIRU.  And you mentioned that we probably would have to raise rates in 2004 to avoid overstimulation at that point. Do we currently have a forecast for in flation for 2004?  I’m just wondering if by raising rates in 2004 we will be too late—later than the market expects—to avoid inflationary pressures at that point.  remarks.  But looking out beyond the Greenbook forecast interval—again, I caution you to take these figures with an enormous grain of salt and maybe an entire salt mine—we would expect close to another 100 basis points of tightening to be necessary in 2004.  Combined with the tightening we’re now assuming in 2003, that additi onal tightening in 2004 brings growth roughly in line with potential, stabilizes th e unemployment rate at just a little above 5 percent, and holds the core PCE inflation rate at roughly 1½ percent.  So the design of this forecast was that it was possible for you to achieve that particular equilibrium going out beyond the Greenbook forecast period with the amount of tightening we built in he re.  Obviously, there ar e associated strategic questions about tightening earlier versus later, and Vincent will be talking about some of those issues in his presentation.

ENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I had a question similar to Mi chael’s, and maybe I should just wait for Vince to talk. Basically I want to ask you wh at you think the markets are telling us about inflation expectations, which we seem to think w ill continue to be low at the end of 2003.  They fit my definition of low, let me put it that way.  A ny inflation rate that starts with a 1 strikes me as low, and inflation doesn’t seem to be goi ng anywhere.  I recognize that 2004 is still up for grabs, but the fed funds market seems to be implying more tightening than we have in our forecast. Certainly we’ve seen a good deal of movement in the yield curve as incoming data have started to be more positive.  It just strike s me that everybody either really believes that a higher rate of return is necessary because of higher rates of productivity or that there is some inflation risk that nobody is talki ng about or that we don’t see in in flation expectations out there.  So that was one question, and probabl y Vince is going to answer that.  strong?  Granted, the levels aren’t strong compared  with other recoveries, but given that there is reason to believe there is no pent-up demand, your  forecast for consumption seems rather strong.  When one looks at it relative to disposable income , it is pretty strong.  Re lative to wealth perhaps it isn’t all that strong, so maybe  there is some room.  But you mentioned some considerations with regard to the risks in the outlook for cons umption.  So I thought I’d just ask you about that. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Well, so far—really up until the current quarter—our consumption functions that include both disposable income and wealth in them were tracking reasonably well.  One of the points I was making in my remarks wa s that we actually have been assuming that there would be some shortfall in  consumption behavior relative to  those fundamentals, given the sharp rise in unemployment and the deterioration we saw at least for a time last fall in consumer sentiment.  That had been a reasonably reliable feature of past business cycle downturns.  Again, up through the fourth quarter of last year, it  looked as if consumption was moving along reasonably close to what the fundamentals would s uggest.  It will be more difficult for us to tell that story if consumer spending continues to increase at the pace th at is apparent thus far in the first quarter. It seems to be moving above wh at the fundamentals would suggest.  Now, that could mean that we’re wrong about the fundamentals.  That’s certainly a po ssibility.  Either the productivity growth could be stronger, or the overall underlying aggregate demand in the economy could be stronger than we think.  And th at may be what that consumption behavior is reflecting. But it’s also possible that we’re going to get a bit of  a payback for some of this current strength going forward.  In essence, we’ve assumed that in this forecast.  We think consumption is getting a little ah ead of the fundamentals in the first quarter, and we expect a bit to about 2½ percent over the c ourse of our projection.   Personally, I think the risks in our consumption forecast are now fairly evenly balanced.  I could see how it could continue to come in st ronger than we’re forecasti ng, but I’m still a little nervous that some of the strength in consumpti on that we’ve seen has been temporary.  It may reflect some relief that this recession isn’t go ing to intensify and peopl e are doing a little more spending. Or the substantial price discounting that we’ve seen may have encouraged spending that is not likely to persist. So I c ould see some downside risk as well.     

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG. President Moskow asked my questions.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. MR. SANTOMERO. I’d be interested in some comments about what is going on in the German and French economies at this point. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Germany is in the awkward position of being the weak link in the euro area, which certainly changes the nature of the de bate within Europe from  that prevailing in the final stages of the pre-EMU period.  Both of t hose economies are in the throes of an election cycle, which is certainly complicating events this  year.  The Germans are in the midst of a wage round, which is getting a little ugl y also, with threats of strike s and disagreements being made public and so forth. So on balance I still se e the French economy as showing a bit more buoyancy and vigor than the German economy.  That  had tended to be the case in 1999-2000.  Oddly, the French economy was looking better than the German economy and showing more flexibility, which is certainly something the Fren ch had not been viewed as possessing before.  That’s still on balance true.   structural reform was supposed to be the key.  Th e tone coming out at the end of that summit was a sense of disappointment.  Part of the explanation of that was this  election cycle.  Schröder, at least based on views of colleagues that I see wh en I travel to Europe, is thought of as having failed. And the CDU is actually rising in the polls,  which presents an interesting notion of what might happen next in Germany.   So on the whole, nothing terrible is ha ppening in either country, but they’re not succeeding in solving the problems they claim to recognize that they have.  On balance, France probably is doing a little  better than Germany in terms of the basic macroeconomic dimensions that we usually track.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Anybody else? If not, who would like to start the roundtable?  Pres ident Jordan.

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On th e region, first I must say that even our most reliably gloomy directors and other business contacts are finding it ha rder to sustain their pessimism, but they work at it.  [Laughter] Broadly interpreted, even those who only grudgingly admit that the situation is not as bad now as it was a few m onths ago—or at least not as bad as they had feared—are very quick to add that busin ess has a long way to go to get back to where it was, in their fond recollections, a couple of year s ago.  Even the technolo gy sector seems to be showing some stirrings.  The very fond memories  that people talked ab out regarding how great things were just a couple of years ago reminde d me of a bumper sticker I often saw when I traveled in Texas on business in the mid-1980s.  It said, “Lord, permit me one more boom, and I promise this time not to piss it away.”  [Laught er]  I think that’s a prayer that policymakers should not want to see granted. be continuing at a solid pace.  In fact, one comp any said that its backlog is now 20 percent above the level of a year ago. One very large construction company that ope rates not only nationally but even outside the United States reported that , as of the end of February, it had already booked 40 percent of the new business it wa s expecting to book this year.   LTV Steel has new owners, and they hope  to resume operations in May.  The combination of unloading retirees’ pensions a nd health care costs onto taxpayers, along with substantial debt write-downs, re negotiated union contracts, plus the new tariffs on imported steel is said to be enough to ensure a good return on investment for the new owners.  And it should enable them to take market share from othe rwise still solvent and from already bankrupt companies as well.  The moral of the episode for the industry may be that the first into bankruptcy wins! Airlines that serve the region continue to report improving tr affic, and they are adding flights, although operations ar e still well below year-ago leve ls.  We checked with major appliance manufacturers that opera te in the region, thinking thei r reports might tell us a little about what is going on in inventories for at leas t one industry.  They said that production this quarter is going to be substantially above that  in the first quarter a year ago—on the order of 20 percent in a couple of cases. But then they we re quick to say, “But re member that the first quarter of last year was a time of sharp redu ctions in production because of concerns about rapidly rising inventories.” No w with inventories at more-acceptable levels and final sales having remained good, they are increasing producti on and expect to report very good earnings for the first quarter. insurance. In fact, one director who sits on the board of directors of one of the nation’s largest insurance companies—and this is an individu al who spent his own career in manufacturing— said that he had never seen an  industry with as much pricing power as the insurance industry enjoys today.  He added that he believes accountants’ fees also will rise sharply in the near future. Turning to the national economy, if there ever was a time to practice pedal-to-the-metal monetary policy, it was last year, es pecially after the terrorist attacks.  We were able not only to inject a massive amount of liquidity during the da ys following the attacks but to continue to do so for a couple of months until economic activity did appear to be stabilizing.  Importantly, we were able to do so with our currency continuing firm in foreign exchange markets and the apparent inflation premium in bond yields remaining more or less steady.  To me that is the best evidence we could hope for that th e credibility of our commitment  to maintaining the purchasing power of our currency is unaltered. It took a long time to build that  credibility.  And the favorable outcome of our policy actions last year  may be due as much to the strength of our reputation as to our actual decisions. By the end of the year, emerging information about the economy was such that reasonable people could differ about  the desirability of more insurance against risks on the downside, and in fact, the Committee’s decision in December was not unanimous.  In the three months since our last policy move, developmen ts in the real economy and in the financial signaled that this economy is highly resilient a nd that the outlook for businesses and households has turned favorable.  During this time, financ ial market commentary has been that monetary    context, an unchanged nominal overn ight rate has become, de facto, more expansionary.  If de jure easing in December was less than a sure thing, then further easing in the subsequent months, even if de facto, is less compelli ng.  Certainly there is a potential for events that will lead to further downside impulses and will unmistakably  be read as such by everyone.  Barring such events, the odds favor the build ing of momentum, the time for  raising the funds rate coming nearer, and the magnitude of the increase becoming larger in order to catch up with the already rising equilibrium rate.   If I were in charge of drafti ng the risk statement—and after I wrote this I realized that Don is not at any risk at all of losing his job—I would say, “Recent and prospective developments in the real economy and in financial markets have tilted the balance of risks toward the stance of policy becoming pro-cyclical on the upside, and we must  remain vigilant of the need to ease off the monetary accelerator.”  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m leaving space between you and Bill Poole!  [Laughter] Go ahead, Bill. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I won’t get into that topic! The sense I have from our directors and also from some commercial real estate folks who recently attended a luncheon at  the Bank is that they don’t see a strong surge in hand, but ther e is a tone of more optimism. My Wal-Mart contact says that  it’s a little hard for the co mpany to figure out what is going on because they believe that they are taking market share, particularly with the K-Mart bankruptcy and store closings. Nevertheless, they are already in the process of revising up earnings expectations. In mi d-February, just about a mont h ago, Wal-Mart announced to up from there.  Inventories are in excellent sh ape.  Higher consumption spending will lead to higher ordering; there is just no excess stock in the stores.  Wal- Mart sees no important regional differences and is expecting sales growth this Ma rch over last March to be  in the 9 to 11 percent range. As for the transportation industry, my FedEx contact said that at  this point vigorous growth in its domestic business did not seem likely, but he indicated that there was a noticeable surge in business from Asia in particular, incl uding Japan.  Currently Asian business is up 7 to 8 percent on a year-over-year basis, and he is anticipating a 9 to 10 perc ent increase for next quarter. Most customers of FedE x say that inventories are now t oo low to meet the demand that they see. While this is not true for those in the high-tech area, even th ere the message is, “Stand by, we may need more capacity for shipping goods.”   He noted especially that the investment incentives in the stimulus bill might have a large impact on the high-tech sector.  My UPS contact said that their custom ers don’t see an immediate surge;  their expectations are that business will improve in the third quarter, but they don’t see it happening quite yet.  The UPS situation is complicated by the f act that its contract with the Teamsters is being negotiated and apparently the Teamsters and UPS at this point are rather far apart.  So, that’s a big problem for them.  My Hunt Trucking Compa ny contact also said that his firm does not see a big surge of business, but he noted that on occasion recently his firm has had to turn down customers because of the unavailability of  trucks for shipping.  There has been a major reduction in capacity because of all the bankruptcies in the trucki ng business, so occasionally—though not often—they have had to turn down business.  recovery. It’s hard to see, for example, how housing can have a big surge.  But from a macro perspective, it does appear to me  that we have a massive amount of policy stimulus in place.  Monetary policy has been very expansionary no matter how one measures it, and there are fiscal incentives as well. So, it may well be that we’re  going to be surprised m odestly sector by sector and that it’s all going to add up to a pretty good year. I want to thank the staff for looking into th e industrial production question.  I think the staff memo on that was distributed  to all Committee members.  Let me just mention the bottom line on this. When growth is vigorous, we know th at there’s a somewhat pro-cyclical pattern to productivity. The initial estimates of industria l production are heavily based on input measures, so in a period of vigorous growth, the estimates of the industrial production index will tend to be underestimates.  Let me cite the history of the initi al reports of monthly ch anges in IP versus the revised numbers for the first twelve months  after a recession trough. Beginning with March 1975, if you add up the first reported month-by-mont h changes over the next twelve months and average them, that gives you 6.83 per cent growth in IP.  Currently, th e index as we look at it says that growth was 10.3 percent in that period.  That gives you an  idea of what happens as a consequence of the index revisions. In the first twelve months after July of 1980, the first reports showed 7.3 percent growth, and it ’s now reported at 10.52 percent.  In the first twelve months after November 1982, the initia l data had growth at 13.13 pe rcent, and it was revised up to15.27 percent. In the year af ter March 1991, growth was initially reported at 1.4 percent, and now it’s shown as 1.8 percent. That was a slow first twelve m onths after a trough.   My main reason for being interested in this s ubject is that, given the prevailing view that we’re going to have a modest recovery, we need  to be very careful that we don’t have our  to the revisions in subsequent months as  we get the actual production data.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Mr. Chairman, our contacts indicate that economic conditions in the Twelfth District are improving, alth ough areas of weakness remain that could restrain the pace of recovery. District contacts re port a pickup in economic activity over the past several weeks, and job growth has turned positive in most states.  The turnaround appears to be broad-based across sectors but is especially solid in those industries hit hardest by  the aftermath of September 11.  Recent job growth has helped keep the District ’s unemployment rate st eady despite strong labor force growth. However, it remains a buyer’s mark et, with numerous job applicants to choose from and little or no upward pressure on wage inflation.   Despite broad signs of recove ry throughout the District, ar eas of weakness do exist.  Commercial construction is a prime example.  Dramatic declines in the demand for office space in 2001 left many commercial real estate markets in the District  with excess supply.  In some IT-sensitive areas, vacancies more than double d, and lease rates dropped 40 percent.  Although contacts report that conditions in commercial office markets have begun to stabilize,  it’s likely to be some time before we see any significan t resumption of new comm ercial construction.  Durable goods manufacturing is anot her area that may be slow to r ecover.  The District’s durable manufacturing sector depends heavily on exports, especially to Asia.  The value of District exports has been falling consistently since the end of 2000, with especially large declines in exports to Japan. Given the ongoi ng strength of the do llar and our disproportionate exposure to some of the weakest global economies, a ra pid turnaround in export demand for District manufactured goods does not  appear imminent.   sector. Conditions in that sector have improved in recent months.  For example, orders, sales, and output among IT firms in the District have rise n, and the pace of job loss in the IT sector has eased. However, we might not see significant imp rovement in profits and payrolls for some  time, and a lagging recovery in the IT sector could well slow the District’s return to full strength.  Turning to the national picture, my interpretation of the economic news since we met in side, suggesting that the recession is over; the trough may well be da ted at December or January.  We’ve revised up noticeably our forecast of real GDP growth both for the current quarter and for all of 2002. This revision includes, I might  add, a steady tightening of monetary policy beginning in the second half of th is year until the funds rate in our forecast reaches 4 percent in the second half of 2003. Our forecast looks a lot like the one in the Greenbook, with growth of real GDP of 3¼ percent in the current quarter, 3½ percent in 2002, and 4¼ percent next year.  Faster growth this year and next is accounted for mainly by a swing in business investment, both for inventories and for equipment and software.  Since we now expect current excess capacity in labor and product markets to evaporate faster than we did before, our revised infl ation forecast for 2003 is up about ¼ percentage point, w ith the core PCE price index ri sing by just under 1½ percent.  That is about the same as we expect for this year.   I believe it’s too soon to begin raising the f unds rate at this mee ting, but we’ll probably need to start this process before long. Ho w much and how quickly we tighten will depend importantly on where we want inflation to end up.  Typically, inflation is lo wer in the year after a recession than in the year before, and that appear s likely to happen this time around as well.  At economic indicators shows a long-run ten-year cons ensus forecast for inflation of 2¼ percent for the GDP price index and 2¾ percent for the CP I.  So it would seem that many business economists, at least, expect us to let inflation rise  from recent levels.  I’d like to see us hold the line at around 1½ percent for the core PC E price index.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The reports that we’re now receiving indicate that the Seventh District economy is most likely in the early stages of recovery.  Manufacturing in the District  is showing clear signs of  a turnaround.  Our Midwest manufacturing index was up in January, with gains in three of the four subsectors we measure.  So the strength is not just in the automobile indu stry.  In addition, for the first time in over a year all three of our regional purchasing managers ’ indexes—for Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee— indicate expansion in February, with stre ngth coming from new orders and production. Our directors and other cont acts report that customers are ordering for inventory rebuilding, and there are even a fe w reports of increases in capital spending from some appliance makers and auto parts suppliers.  Nonetheless, ma ny contacts remain cautious.  At this time most businesses are saying that there is significant excess capacity and they are not planning to increase spending on fixed capital as quickly as  they had coming out of previous slowdowns.  Our advisory councils that met earlier this m onth echoed those comments about capital spending. With regard to the labor market, manufacturers still appear hesitant to hire permanent employees, but two major temporary help firms h eadquartered in our District are seeing modest increases nationally in demand fr om manufacturers.  One of th em even mentioned receiving emergency calls from clients who were rampi ng up production unexpectedly.  January data for the nation as a whole, and the pace of layoffs al so has slowed.  Nonetheless, consumer spending is not looking as bright as elsewhere in the natio n.  Reports from our contact s in the retail, travel, tourism, and entertainment industries were very un even.  Still, by and large, even those reporting weak sales were not saying that things were getting worse.  Furthermore, housing markets remain strong, and if labor markets continue to improve, that should bolster household sector spending going forward.  Automakers are more bullish; most have raised their 2002 sales forecast once again—this time by more than 500,000 vehicles compared with the estimates they had last time we met.  However, they expressed concern about increases in steel prices resulting from the recently imposed tariffs even though thei r purchase prices are fixed by one- or two-year contracts. Turning to the national outlook, at our January  meeting I was expecting that real GDP would increase 3 percent this year.  Since then the outlook ha s clearly improved.  The household sector has continued to surprise us on the ups ide.  The positive deve lopments on productivity should bolster household incomes and business prof its, and the economic stimulus package is a plus for investment.  Still, there continue to be  downside risks.  Inventory rebuilding will boost production, but whether that incr ease is sustainable will depend on whether the economy generates more-fundamental increases in final de mand.  Even with the stimulus package, I see investment as a major risk.  Our forecast builds in a weaker-than-average cyclical recovery in business fixed investment.  However, I’m con cerned that excess capacity may weigh on capital spending even more than we have assumed.  And negative wealth effects could weigh on the household sector more than our cu rrent outlook projects.  So in light of these considerations, while I believe a recovery is under way, I expect that growth in the first year will be slower than  today than when we met in January.

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While the news on the District economy is still somewhat mixed, I would have to say that in general it has been on the positive side, perhaps surprisingly positive.  Hiring has resumed.  Activit y in the manufacturing sector has stabilized and begun to expand. Mining activity on the ir on range in northern Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has star ted to pick up, and that was tr ue even before the tariffs on imported steel were announced.  And for the most part, the economies in th e western part of the District are reported to be doing well.  Residential construction is  a particularly bright spot.  Some builders have indicated that they are booked out into 2003, although cancellations are always possible. I’m hearing very little about inflationary pressures, though of course one can find particular items about which people have so me price concerns.  Business attitudes are the one thing that continues to concern me because  I think business people are still uncertain and quite cautious about the economic environment. I suspect that is largely because of their concerns about profits going forward. And I suspect  that some at least are still adjusting with some difficulty to an environment of price stab ility.  Retailers have generally done well in the District and, as Bill Poole mentioned, inventories in the retail arena are low.  So if positive sales surprises continue, that will lead to substantial ordering and presumably to increases in production. On the national scene, I have few comments to make.  For some time, there have been reasons to be optimistic, and now I don’t think it’s  going out on a limb to say that the recovery is at hand. I’m impressed by the size of the upward revision to the Greenbook forecast.  I, too, was inclined to change my view on that just yet, partially because there’s noise in the data and partially because I think there may be some payback  effect yet to come from the consumer side.  But if we do get growth of something like 3 pe rcent, which is below the Greenbook forecast, I would still consider that to be a very satisfactory, or maybe  better than satisfactory, year.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  Don’t laugh. It just encourages him!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. We know that the future ke eps changing, but so does the past.  The BLS has lopped 215,000 jobs off the estimate for Texas for the end of December, and that revision converted what we thought was an employment ga in of 1 percent into an employment reduction of 1 percent. If I’m not mist aken, it changed the Dallas area from  being characterized as one of the strongest metropolitan areas in  the country in terms of empl oyment growth to one with an actual employment decline.  We had thought that  employment in Texas had turned down about six months later than in the nation, but now it seem s to have turned down at about the same time, around April. So we are in close correlation to the national economy in that regard. In the latest Beige Book, the re port from the Dallas District was one of the most negative, if not the most negative, of the twelve Districts.  I asked for a report at last Thursday’s board meeting on whether our contacts had seen signs of a pickup in the few weeks since the Beige  most commented that they were seeing a contin uation of sluggish conditions.  The report from  the semiconductor industry was downbeat.  The pic kup in demand is not as robust as was thought a month ago.  And there’s an expectation that  much of the new capacity in the 300 millimeter wafer fabs will go offshore to Taiwan.   It may be too soon to say that the Texas recession has ended, but the stronger-than­expected performance of the U.S. economy rais es the prospect of a quick turnaround.  After Our leading indicators have been climbing for the last few months, and I’m becoming increasingly confident that growth will begin this spring. One reason for concern has to do with the potential downside ri sks for the Mexican economy.  I’m hoping that the Greenbook analysis of the Mexican economy, which suggests that the worst is over, is correct. However, the stro ng peso is pricing the maquiladoras out of the employment fell an unprecedented 17 percent in 2001.  And Mexico’s goal of getting its inflation rate to converge with that of the United States will conti nue to support a strong peso, which may not bode well for a vigorous turnaround in Mexican manufacturing as the U.S. economy continues to rebound. Leading indicators for the Mexican economy do not poi nt to an upturn any time soon, and most forecasters anticipate growth in  2002 that is too weak to generate growth in output per capita. If the maquiladoras continue to be priced out of the labor market, a U.S. recovery may not translate into job gains along th e border or increases in  Mexican imports from Texas, as we might otherwise expect. earlier discussion of Argentina, which I t hought was very good.  Turning to the national economy, is this a great country or what?  [Laught er]  I must say that I find the persistent strength in the economic data to be very encour aging, and like everybody el se, I’ve been revising up my forecasts over the last few weeks.  The gr owth in productivity increases my optimism that any increase in inflation pressures will be delayed and subdued and that growth beyond the recovery will be more vigorous than we might have expected before, looking perhaps more like the later ’90s than the earlier ’90s.  While we now have greater fiscal policy stimulus in the pipeline than was the case at our January meeting, th e bulk of that stimulus is not likely to be felt for some time.  Given the consistently improve d economic data, the risks to the forecast seem  more evenly balanced than they have been in quite a while.  The only thing that concerns me a bit is the upward creep in oil prices in recen t weeks; that could become a wild card going forward.

MS. MINEHAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I look over the incoming data on the New England economy and consider the views expre ssed at various meetings I’ve attended in the period since the FOMC last met—meetings of our various advisory councils, our board of directors, and a variety of co mmunity groups of which I’m a member—I’m struck by a couple of things. First, as compared with the situation at our last meeting, not a lot has changed.  The current situation remains challenging, but the economy appears to have bottomed out in an increasing number of areas.  And the six-month horizon appears if not bright then considerably better than the present. But s econd, as we look back over 2001, wh at has changed since our last meeting—along the lines of what Bob McTeer just said—is our appreciation of what went on been thought, and this is playing out in most states, particularly in Massachusetts, in the form of a fiscal crisis.   Employment rose in New England in Janua ry, and unemployment fell.  And while the unemployment rate remains signific antly below that of the nation, labor markets are said to be much easier, with temp firms especially comm enting on the increased availability of supply.  Business is still quite weak for the staffing firm s; the fourth quarter was characterized as the worst ever by one contact. But signs of a pi ckup in 2002 are emerging.  Software and IT firms said demand rose in recent weeks, as customer s began to activate dormant investment plans.  Discretionary IT spending continues to be on hold, but some software niches are growing, particularly in the areas of security, supply chain management, and bio informatics.  Small businesses and manufacturers say they are investi ng in must-do projects, especially those that increase productivity. But in general they’re trying to make do with existing technology.  In some cases, and this was particularly interesting, o fficials of small firms th at are part of our New England Advisory Council—more than a couple of them—reported that they actually were using new technology to bring manufacturing back to th e United States from places like India.  Apparently they’ve run into innovations that have enabled them to offset the higher local salary and benefit costs, partic ularly in New England, and to improve the profitability and quality of their products as well. Real estate markets in the region seem to ha ve survived the worst of the downturn, with increases in commercial vacancy rates flattening out and residential markets gaining a bit, though it should be noted that residentia l markets in the region never real ly softened all that much.  Similarly, consumer and business confidence ha s continued to pick up, though most of the recent meeting of our Bank’s board of directors, I found the sentiment to be similar to what others have mentioned.  Businesses and bankers represented on the board were singularly more cautious—more conservative, if you will—and more concerned about the current situation than the economic data might warrant, particularly  the economic data at the national level. Recent annual revisions to regional employme nt data help to answer a few questions about the nature of the region’s downturn over th e past year or so.  Given the concentration within the region of high-tech manufacturing and software firms, one wo uld have expected New England to have experienced the r ecession earlier, more lik e the West Coast, a nd to be hit harder than the rest of the country. Earlier data did not indicate steeper employm ent losses than in the nation as a whole, but benchmark revisions now suggest that this was in fact the case.  Such losses seem to have been concentrated in Ma ssachusetts and primarily in business services, particularly in the area of computer services.  The fact that the new data draw a bit different picture than the old likely relates to the number of small high-tech busin esses in the region and the difficulty of accurately capturing the data from such firms in the ongoing employment information.   The revised trajectory of employme nt also helps to explain the severity of the state fiscal crises in New England and especially in Massachusetts.  Outsized state revenue increases in the late ’90s, fueled largely by capital gains and taxes on realized stock options, had financed expanded Medicaid benefits and cuts in state in come taxes.  Stock market related revenues stopped growing in 2001. Indeed, in Massachusetts  overall state revenue grew at a rate of 7 percent or so in fiscal 2001 and is actually c ontracting at a rate of 10 percent in fiscal 2002.  Given the pace of Medicaid cost increases this  year and the yet-to-be-implemented phases of 2003, even assuming that a solid recovery in the re gion is in place.  Given the size of state rainy day reserves, which grew substantially during th e ’90s, some amount of the gap can be filled.  But filling the rest won’t be easy and will likely involve sizable cuts in state spending and the collection of new revenues of  one sort or another.  Turning to the national picture, nearly ever y data release since our last Federal Open economy.  From the upward revision to fourth-q uarter GDP to the surprising growth in productivity, the beginnings of job growth in  2002, the flattening of inventory depletion, the continued willingness of consumers to buy autos and houses, and the glimmers of a reenergized manufacturing sector, the situation is better now th an I certainly expected it would be when we met in January. Looking forward, the shape of our forecast is not unlike that of the Greenbook’s.  Given the surprising strength of Q4 and now Q1, we see GDP growth moderating a bit for the rest of the year, with growth Q4 over Q4 at about our estimate of potentia l—3¼ percent or so—and then faster growth in 2003.  Given the moderate pace of the economy’s rebound, unemployment in our forecast trends down slowly and inflation stays about the same, no matter what measure we use. Obviously then, I don’t see much to find fault with in the general parameters of the Greenbook forecast. I would raise two questions about the outlook, however.  The first involves the risks to the forecast.  As I see it, the risks, along th e lines of Dave Stockton’s comments, are becoming much more balanced than they were.  On the downside, I think the very heights of the equity and high debt levels. There is certainly some un certainty about business spending other than that related to inventory depleti on given the high levels of ex cess capacity.  Clearly the new depreciation allowances work only if businesses want and need new equipment.  I don’t think a 2 percent reduction in th e cost of capital is enough to driv e new spending on its own.  Finally, I think there is some downside risk  in the state and local sector; I don’t think Massachusetts is alone in experiencing a fiscal crisis.  But unlike the situation at th e last meeting, there are upsid e risks as well.  Consumer spending could be more ebullient than the mode st growth pattern in the forecast.  Indeed, comparisons of spending to wealth relationships suggest the possibility of some upside risk in that regard. So, unlike Dave, in terms of the consumer I see risks on both the downside and the upside. Contacts at Thomson First Call have st opped their bearish comments and seem to feel that analysts’ projections  of profits, even in technology, are believable.  Except for Japan, the rest of the world seems to be pulling out of the downturn, and the potential for pressure on oil and other commodity prices is there. So th e bets are not all one  way at last.   This leads me to the second question—and a lo t of people have made  reference to this— and it’s a policy-rela ted question.  By any measure, the stance of policy right now is stimulative.  Real interest rates are at or below zero.  This is appropriate for an economy in a downturn with lots of downside risks. Such risks prevail, but the strength of incoming da ta and the existence of upside risks as well seem to me to argue for a me asured return to a more  neutral stance.  That would require a move back to a nominal rate so mewhere in the 4 percen t area, at least on the basis of the Bluebook analysis of equilibrium real  rates. The question is how fast that move should be. The Greenbook forecast and the market s as well assume that the move will begin     only slowly falling unemployment and in flation that, if anything, eases.   Clearly, we need to be forward-looking in pol icy, and we need to be concerned about the potential for the economy to overshoot.  But I thi nk we also need to be asking ourselves basic questions about whether or not unemployment rates in the low 5s, with inflation somewhere in the 1s, is what we’re aiming for.  Is that really th e target of policy?  We need to be talking about those questions in a more explicit fashion as we  move ahead.  For right now, I think there’s probably a little time yet to engage in conversation a bout our objectives.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In looking at economic activity in the Tenth District, we have to separate out Colorado a bit from the rest of the region.  Excluding Colorado, we are seeing fairly good signs of a turn around.  Layoff announcements have subsided, consumers continue to spend, and housing activ ity is solid.  Moreover, business confidence appears to be inching back up in most of the Dist rict.  Colorado continues to contract because of some real weakness in the telecom sector, which continues to be plagued by excess capacity and some rather tough price competition. Let me talk a little about the manufacturing sector.  It is improving and, based on our surveys, there are signs of greater optimism a bout the future.  The Bank’s latest manufacturing survey found that production a nd shipments strengthened a bit in February.  In addition, optimism about future production and orders con tinued to build.  For the first time in many months, firms in the manufacturing sector expect to be hiring workers in the near future rather than laying them off.  For now, capital spending remains below year-ago levels, but I’m hearing a lot of conversations about how manufacturers are looking at ta king advantage of the new tax plans and the timing of any future investment.  So it is on their minds at this point.   Commercial real estate in th e District remains weak.  Vacan cies are high in most of our realtors saying that there may be at least a two-year inventory in  that city, so they are a bit pessimistic right now.  Consumer spending and hous ing activity are generally  solid in the region.  Apart from a few high-end stor es, retailers say their sales have been improving and are somewhat above year-ago levels.  And home sale s have also strengthen ed.  Starter homes are doing very well, and even the high-end area is st arting to see some activity.  Energy activity has stabilized after declining through the second half of last year.  The District’s rig count is the lowest in two years, and coal prices have come  down fairly sharply, making it hard even for low-cost producers in Wyoming to be making a prof it right now.  Labor ma rkets are slack, although there are signs suggesting that em ployment is stabilizing.  We continue to experience a shortage of nurses in our region and a limite d availability of workers in a few skilled areas, but employers are still able to find help without very much difficulty.  At our  Okalahoma City board meeting, a director who has a nationwide tem porary help agency said that ac tivity at the firm had picked up significantly across the country. So there are some signs of a pickup in demand for temporary help. Price pressures without question remain low across the region.  And the ag sector is waiting for the farm bill. Let me turn to the national economic outlook.  Our assessment is really quite similar to the Greenbook’s, namely that growth should be above trend beginning this  quarter and continue through next year. The economic factors generati ng this forecast are clear, and I’ll only mention them.  First, monetary policy is  clearly stimulative, with th e real fed funds rate in the Energy prices remain relatively low, although we ar e seeing some increases in  that area.  And the inventory adjustment is contributing to growth. Having cited these facts, I have a couple of observations—or maybe I should call them concerns. First, I think the likelihood that the rate of output growth will be greater than trend this year is high and increasing; if I were to put a number on it, I’d say the probability is above 50 percent.  While the output gap is positive, th e probability that the gap will close sooner rather than later is increasing, not decr easing.  My second point is that the current fed funds rate, as others have said, is clearly below equilibri um, and I would say perhaps significantly below equilibrium.  At its current level, it is genera ting substantial amounts of liquidity and, therefore, setting up conditions that I think will give rise to future economic imbalances.  Moreover, taking into account Dave’s lesson number 4, it is cr eating conditions that could generate higher inflation, say, twelve to eighteen months from now, based on the length and variability in the lags. So, in my view these are some of the f actors we should talk abou t in the policy round.  I would offer one other thought: I th ink moving sooner, maybe even t oday, may mean that we will have to move less later.  And I believe that woul d be very favorable in the long term for the U.S. economy.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Coffee is available,  and I think we can take a break.  When we return we will resume with President Broaddus. [Coffee break] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Broaddus. MR. BROADDUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Conditions have definitely improved in our District since the last m eeting, as seems to be the case elsewhere around the country.   point their optimism is still rather cautious, along th e lines of the attitudes that Gary Stern and some others have described for their Districts.  Breaking it down a little, local ar eas in our District with a significant defense presence, such as the Washington, D.C., and the Norfolk, Virginia, areas, are r ecovering nicely.  We are also beginning to see some improvement in the Di strict’s manufacturing base in the Carolinas.  Furniture shipments and orders in particular have strengthened, presumably because of the continued strength in housing na tionwide.  There has also been a glimmer of improvement for the first time in a very long time in  the textile industry.  That pr obably is also related to housing activity, and it has been quite a while since I’ve been able to say anything positive about that industry. We also see improved conditions in so me other industries represented in our region, notably plastics and chemicals.  So there are cert ainly some signs that our region is participating in the apparent revival of the economy nationally. Other indicators, though, suggest that while momentum is building, it is building at a fairly moderate pace in our area.  For exampl e, what I hear about consumer spending in the region is fairly positive, but I wouldn’t call it spectacu lar by any means.  A number of retailers tell us they still have to do a lot of disc ounting to move particul ar goods and services.  Employment appears to have stoppe d declining in the region, but as far as I can tell it really hasn’t turned up sharply yet. And we still he ar a few announcements of layoffs from time to time, although not nearly as many as we did last fall. The revised Greenbook projecti ons, of course, indicate a more pronounced improvement in the national outlook than some of the anecdot al comments I just summarized for our region might suggest.  But the projections ar e certainly plausible, given the strength of the latest data.  It    rapidity of the evolution of conditions genera lly.  I also, like Bob McTeer, thought Dave did a great job with his briefi ng, and I think the lessons  were well stated and well taken.  Still, the revisions from the last Greenbook to this one —and I’ve been looking at the Greenbooks for many years—are about as dramatic as any I can remember.  The staff now expects real GDP to grow at a rate of 4 percent in the first half compared with 2 percent predicted only seven weeks ago. For me perhaps the most striking change is  the 2 percentage point upward revision in the projection for real GDP growth in the first quarter despite a fairly sign ificant downward revision in the contribution from a slower pace of inventor y liquidation.  Of course, the difference is a big change in the projection of priv ate domestic final purchases, which are now expected to grow at a 2 percent rate in the quarter as compared w ith the earlier projection of  a 2½ percent rate of strengthening of final demand obviously reduces the downside ri sks that many of us, myself included, were very worried about last fall. Moreover, the net growth in jobs in Februar y, even if some of it was due to favorable weather conditions, suggests to me that the labor market may be st abilizing.  I thi nk that’s very important because, if that is  the case, it would reduce job security as a concern among consumers.  And continued solid growth in jobs  and real wages is need ed to support consumer growth at the 2 to 3 percent range projected in the Greenbook.   Finally, the improvement in the manufacturi ng and industrial sector s of the economy at the national level—in addition to the regional improvement th at I mentioned earlier—also reduces the downside risks looking forward because the weakness had been concentrated in those sectors.  It now appears that manufacturing output will rise in the first quarter for the first time  significant improvement in business spending for equipment projected in the Greenbook actually materializes.  Against this background, it seems clear that  the key question regarding the near-term outlook for the economy from the perspective of policy—and others have alluded to this—is how strong the early stages of this r ecovery will be.  I think the answer to that question is going to turn in large part on the timing and the profile  of the swing from i nventory liquidation to inventory accumulation that presumably the economy is now in the process of going through.  The Greenbook expects continued inventory liquida tion, albeit at a progre ssively slower rate, through the middle of the year wi th actual restocking only beginning thereafter.  I think the turn actually could come sooner due to stronger expected  sales growth.  If it does, that could have a significant impact on the behavior of the economy  in the months ahead, which has implications for our policy in the near term that we need  to think about when we have our go-around on policy later. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, business conditio ns have also improved in the Sixth District since our last meeting.  Indications are that the pace of  economic activity is increasing despite the fact that conditions in some industries and some regions are still quite weak.  The District’s single-family housing market remains strong, fueled by low mortgage rates.  However, the large, stale inventory of high-end homes has shown little sign of declining, and one builder is now referring to these as “yet-to-be-used” hom es [laughter] because he says he cannot in good conscience continue to call them  new after having been on the market for so long.  A similar problem remains in our District’s commercial r eal estate market.  Vacancy rates are high, and  architectural firm—in fact the on e that did our buildi ng—initiated a first round of layoffs last month. And major commercial builders tell me that  they routinely are seei ng eight to ten bidders on jobs that used to draw only two or three.   Our tourism and hospitality sector conti nues a slow but steady recovery.  Airport passenger traffic has improved every month since Se ptember.  Delta tells us that their domestic traffic was down a little over 8 percent in Febr uary from the same period a year ago, with international traffic still down about 13 percent.  Delta has not sat idly by, though.  They have used this period of extraordinary stress to do some  very aggressive cost cutting.  By dropping and only slowly restoring a number of flights, the company has actua lly achieved higher load factors than it had pre-September.  In addition to cutting food service, th ey have announced the discontinuation of payments to travel agents. And just last week they announced that there would be no wage increases for non-union, non-ma nagement workers in the year 2002.   Our manufacturing sector is still mixed but is  beginning to show si gns of returning to some stability.  Planned production cuts in March at the Ford auto assembly plant in Atlanta were not executed because sales of the Taurus m odel that is being built there for the rental car industry had improved significantly.  In contrast, the former Lucent fiber optics division will lay off 300 more workers because of continued weak ness in the telecommunications industry.  At Lockheed’s Marietta plant this week 2,700 union machinists walked off the job in a dispute over job guarantees. Interestingly, the average age of  the striking workers is  53, with twenty-one years of experience at the Lockheed plant.   Regional transportation businesses reported th at rail and truckload volume improved for some commercial and industrial cargo but remained  weak for coal, forest products, and paper.  tariffs has come home to roost so to speak, as Russia banned American shipments of poultry products to their country. This developmen t does not bode well for Southern poultry producers where exports from Georgia and Mississippi currently account fo r about 15 percent or more of the local poultry indus try’s revenue.   On the national front, the flow  of more positive information that many of us noted in economy is on a more upward trajectory.  However, I’m not yet prepared to be quite as optimistic as either the Greenbook or our own Bank’s VAR model forecast about the speed or the trajectory of the recovery. I continue to  be somewhat cautious, thinking that, after the inventory rebound has materialized, growth in final demand may be more modest than some are anticipating, with le ss improvement in profits and investment  spending.  One of my directors last week quoted someone as suggesting that it’s begi nning to feel like a profitless prosperity.  In addition to other fundamentals that would seem lik ely to temper the vigor of the recovery, the recent rise in oil prices, as others have men tioned, could have a damping effect on demand and serves as a reminder of the risks th at once again may be facing us.   Balanced against these cautions I do recognize a number of factors that are consistent with the more positive outlook pres ented in the Greenbook.  First, s ubstantial stimulus remains in the pipeline. The money supply continues to grow at a very strong pace. Second, it’s now clear that government deficit spending will likely expand, adding to aggregate demand.  And the recently passed investment tax credit, as almost everyone has suggested, should further bolster demand for equipment and software, which already appears to be picking up.  In that regard, I would mention a confirming anecdote from the chie f financial officer of UPS.  He noted that over-year basis and that this tr end had carried over into the first quarter of this year.  Additionally, while paring back their purchases of  vehicles and airplanes, UPS told us that they are pushing ahead with their own computer and software invest ments.  And our contact at Cingular Wireless, headquartered in Atlanta, indicated that th ey were pushing ahead with the roll-out of a new generation of wi reless services on a pilot basis in  California.  Third, our recent contacts in the auto industry indicate that early March auto sales are continuing at a 16 million pace. Given that automakers show few signs of pulling back rebate and favorable financing programs, there may be little or no payback from last quarter’s extraordinary sales.  Fourth, the sustained rebound in productivity noted in th e Greenbook may portend a more positive outlook for growth. That, coupled with the fact that many firms drastically cut their workforces, may present a more positive profit picture, especi ally if firms remain cautious about hiring.  Consistent with Tom Hoenig’s comment just before  the break, some of our directors suggest that this is the case in reporting that incrementa l additions to the workforces of many firms are occurring through the hiring of temporaries rather than full-time employees.  Putting this all together leads me to the conclusion that the ri sks to the expansion have clearly become more balanced. Having said that, I w ould emphasize that I do not believe that the downside risks have gone away or gotten substantially smaller. And I think we have time to judge more carefully the momentum of the expansion before we start reversing the path of interest rates.   Now more than ever we need to think a bout the longer run, and I believe that the Greenbook simulations help us in th at regard.  Frankly, if offered the opportunity to lock in any one of the forecasts in the alternative simulations in the short run, I would take it in a minute.  At this point, my own hunch is that the slower growth scenario may be among the most likely.      need to begin to rise. Hence, I believe we must  get in a position to make  that happen.  Suppose we ask ourselves, What should the nominal funds rate be with a real GDP forecast of 3 to 4 percent, as now reflected in  the Greenbook, and PCE inflation be tween 1.4 and 1.6 percent?  It seems clear that the answer would not be “nea r 1¾ percent” but something more like “4 to 4½ percent.” This means that we have a lot of work to do.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

ENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I reported at our last meeting at the end of January that the foundation for recovery was in  place in the Third District.  I now believe that such a recovery is under way. District econom ic conditions have improved over the past two months. The manufacturing and retail sectors have strengthened, and the outlook of business contacts in the region has turned considerably  more positive.  There are still pockets of weakness. For example, commercial vacancy rate s have increased in the last few months.  Nonetheless, forward-looking indicators suggest continued improvement ahead.   Our most recent data come from the Business Outlook Survey of area manufacturers.  The March survey results will be released this T hursday.  I reported last time that the index of general activity had turned positive in January for the first time in fourteen months.  That increase was followed by another increase in February, and our March survey will show another positive reading at 11 percent.  While that is marginally lower than February’s 16 percent reading, I’m not too concerned about this decline for two reasons.  Fi rst, the swing we saw in this index from negative to positive in January had been  larger than the typical swing at the end of recessions. Second, though fewer firms reported an increase in activity in March, the number of firms reporting increases was more widely dist ributed across industries.  The indexes on reporting increases than decreases.   Last month the index of de livery times rose above zero for the first time in two years and it, too, remained  positive this month.  While firms continue to reduce inventories in March, the reductions are slowi ng; and for the first time during this downturn, firms are reporting that they expect to increase inventories in the next six months.  Our survey also indicates that manufacturing firms continue to shed workers.  They did so in activity, the employment outlook has also stre ngthened since Januar y.  Our March survey suggests that in general, manufact urers expect to increase payrolls  over the next six months.   In a special question in this month’s survey we  asked the firms that expected to increase production how they expected to do it. Over 40 per cent said that they pla nned to hire additional workers; about 30 percent planned to increase th e work hours; and about 25 percent expected to increase production solely thr ough increased productivity  of current staff working at current hours. I find this last number particularly interesting. It underscores th e fact that productivity gains have become a significant component of bus iness strategy in our area.  Productivity gains and weaker demands in earlier months have helped to contain price pressure s in the District.  In turned positive for the first time in eight months.  Price expectations are positive and rising.   My view of the national economy has turned  significantly more positive over the intermeeting period, as the data have been fairly consistently on the high si de of expectations.  I now believe the economy has turned.  Notwithstandi ng the strong data, I con tinue to believe that this recovery will be weaker than most experienced in the postwar period.  As we all know, however, weaker than usual doesn’t mean weak in  the absolute.  In fact, the current range of characterization of a recovery th at is weaker than the average postwar experience.  This view partly reflects the strength of consumption spending throughout this economic downturn, which has been the primary factor in the mildness of th is recession.  In the early stages of a recovery, real PCE growth is typically quite strong, often above 5 percen t, reflecting recovery in the consumption of durables more so than nondurables and services.  But during this downturn, auto and home sales have remained strong.  With less pent-up demand, consumption growth should remain moderate.  I also believe that it will take  time for business spending to reignite.  On the other hand, the government budget continues to be  more stimulative than anyone might have guessed only a year ago, and businesses have a hab it of responding quickly to changes in market conditions. So we may yet be  surprised on the upside.   In any case, given the revised, more positive outlook, I believe it’s time to refocus our attention on the longer run.  We now see that the r ecovery is in place.  That’s not to say it’s a sure thing, but economic conditions have begun to improve across various sectors.  Our expansionary monetary policy is having the desired effect.  The Committee now needs to contemplate its strategy for moving th e stance of monetary policy back toward neutrality.  At this point, we don’t need to decide wh ere neutral is, but we need to ta ke the necessary steps to allow us to raise rates in the not too distant future.  This means preparing the public and the market for such a time.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Olson. MR. OLSON. Let me add a couple of thoughts to  what has been said thus far.  We’ve talked a bit about the seeming di sparity between the attitude of business leaders and the direction of the economy. I spent a good part of the ’90s doing stra tegic planning and identifying  telescoping down of a multit ude of corporate goals to a single one  of shareholder value.  I think the extent to which the business community will be happy with a recovery in the economy and the performance of their individual businesses wi ll depend in part on whet her or not they think the stock market is going to recognize it.  So until that happens, I suspect that we will have a somewhat pessimistic or at least somewhat disappointed business community.  Should they see the market start to perk up, I think we will see a difference in attitude. I tried to identify some of the public policy i ssues that may affect the economy, and there are a few. One of them is the cu rrent absence at the moment of te rrorist insurance.  I think there will be a bill before this session of the Congress e nds that will provide a backstop for that risk.  We had some discussion earlier about the effect of the la ck of terrorist insurance on the commercial mortgage-backed market.  As the Greenbook points out, the market seems to have identified and isolated the areas of risk.  So I think that the Greenbook well pretty captures that particular exposure. We’ve talked about the stimulus package.  The Greenbook also deals with the potentially explosive Middle Ea st situation.  And the scenario  in the alternative simulation that called for a $10 per barrel incr ease in the price of oil, with  only a modest downward pressure on the economy, seems to me to iden tify that risk exposure.  A thir d one, the steel tariffs, we also talked about a bit. An important  factor will be the manner in which the rest of the world views the imposition of those tariffs—a point that Kare n discussed in an earlie r meeting.  It will be interesting to see whether the world sees that as a political event that is a single, isolated anomaly or if they see it as a drift toward protectionism.  I think that will be determined in part on how the Bush Administration follows up that action and how it chooses  to comment on it on an ongoing basis.  government budget.  The staff projects from 2002 to  2003 a 6 percent increas e in federal receipts in spite of the tax increase and only a 4 percent increase in expenditures.  That will take more discipline in an election year than we saw in the last election year cycle.  So I think that’s a potential downside risk. Having said that, I do not see any exposures that were not well captured in the Greenbook analysis and in  the other material provided.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairma n.  The Second District’s economy has shown further signs of improvement in recent weeks.  Retail sales were reported to be above plan in February, rebounding from a lu ll in January.  Consumer confidence picked up noticeably in metropolitan New York City; there’s a much better feel to the community.  Labor both New York City and northern New Jersey in January.  Residential markets for single-family homes as well as co-ops and condos  have continued to gain moment um since my last report.  In fact, the only weakness in the Manhattan market now is for rental office space and rental apartments.  Bankers report some let-up in cons umer loan demand.  They are enforcing tighter credit standards on their commercial borrowers , and delinquency rates are holding about the same.   We agree essentially with the size and shape of the forecast in the Greenbook, and I must say that I, too, applaud today’s staff presen tation.  Anything that combines humility, self-confidence, and humor is much to be applauded.  We  think that the risks in the outlook are in fact about balanced. Consumer confidence could be a little less than both our staff and the     probably has more downside than upside risk to it.             In regard to the query about business fixed investment, I think you probably all heard of the business conference that was held in Boca Ra ton about three weeks ago.  They should have been looking at the same data we are, and yet the vast consensus was that we were still in a recession and would not pull out of it until toward the end of the year.  I think business people clearly are mesmerized by their own concerns about their profit pict ures and probably are drawing too flat a trend li ne from their experience in the latter  part of last year.  One would have to think, if the business recovery  is stronger than they expect, especially in light of labor productivity, that profits almost ha ve to be stronger than they ar e anticipating or that at least a pleasant surprise in their profits could take place.   And that could get business confidence turned up more than we are anticipating in our forecast. Inventories are also an intere sting situation because those of  us who firmly believe that the inventories were being handled better becau se of information technology actually had a pretty good story going through the fi rst three quarters of  2001.  But in the last quarter the steep drop in inventories was just way off the scale. So I think one has to assume that a lot of the inventory liquidation was involuntary on the part of businesses and was a result of consumer spending coming back much stronger than they thought it would.  Now the question is whether the secular downward trend in the inventory- sales ratio will continue—which I think is essentially what all of us are assuming in our forecasts—or whether the present inventory-sales ratio after that fourth-quarter dr op is lower than businesses want it to be.  If it’s the latter, restocking could occur sooner and be more intense, which would be a very big positive kick and an upside risk to the forecast.   though, that my gut is telling me th at the upside potential is probabl y greater than we have in the forecast. So it seems to me that we’re in a period of watchful waiting and that perhaps we should be particularly aware of the upside risk potential. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The phrase “March madness” normally refers to basketball but, as we can tell from the staff’s introductory statements, March madness this year describes the frustration in the forecas ting community as they deal with the changing incoming data.  And I’m extremely sympathetic to that.  I was one of those who saw mainly the downside risks at our last meeting, and I must say that this time it does app ear that the risks are much more balanced. First, on the upside, let me pick up where Bill McDonough just left off.  I also looked at the inventory swing as possibly creating an upside risk.  Clearly there are some signs that the massive inventory liquidation undertak en in the U.S. economy last ye ar is over.  The pace with which rebuilding occurs I suspect will be driven by a number of factors, but some may have to do with this sense of uncertainty due to terrorist attacks.  That might lead businesses to want to hold more inventories than had previously been the case.  And as Bill indicated, the inventory-sales ratios, instead of continui ng to come down, may stabilize and i ndeed be a little higher than I think is implicit in the Greenbook.   The second area of upside risk has also been  touched on, and that is this question of productivity. I, like others, am pleased that pr oductivity seems to have held up quite well during this downturn. We saw just a few years ago th at an economy that is enjoying a positive supply shock is not immune from upside risk or inflat ionary pressures.  And it may well be that the  consumption than perhaps is bui lt into most people’s forecasts. The third area of upside risk is that the indica tors certainly suggest that things are turning rather quickly. Let me just point out a coupl e of them.  One is the ISM, formerly NAPM, indicator. Manufacturi ng activity rose in February to th e highest level in a year.  More importantly and interestingly, the new orders in dex from the ISM surged in February to its highest level since 1994, which I th ink is perhaps more positive news on the orders front than others may have picked up.  Finally and most importantly on this sense of upside risks—and others have said this—both fis cal and monetary policy would ha ve to be described as being stimulative for good reasons.  But those forces th at are built into the system may propel the economy over the next several quarters and lead to  growth that is significantly above trend.   That said, there are still four  things that I consider ongoing downside risks.  One is that, while the growth rate is likely to pick up, the level of GDP will still leave an output gap for the forecast period. As a result of this output ga p, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high, hanging up above the staff’s estimate of the short- term NAIRU for some quarters to come.  That A second element of downside risk is that not only do we have slack in labor markets but significant slack in capacity utilization appears to exist as well.  That may lead to a reduction in the incentives for businesses to expand capacity ev en as demand picks up.  I would add to this the apparent pessimism of CEOs in  our largest businesses, which I think creates a further risk for the investment picture.  And unf ortunately the CEOs of the larger firms are not the only ones with an uncertain outlook.  The most recent NFIB  survey results suggest that CEOs in smaller businesses also are quite cautious about i nvestment, inventory, and hiring plans.  of CEOs seems to be driven by a strong sense of a weak profit outlook.  One must wonder what the CEOs are picking up from their sales forces in  particular that leads them to be much more pessimistic than the aggregate data might suggest .  At some point, I th ink there has to be a recalibration or a reconnection between what the CEOs see and what the GDP numbers are reporting. And indeed, if the profit outlook of  CEOs—built on their anecdotal data and their order books—turns out to be correct, then obviously that’s a bit more  of a downside risk. Finally, many of the forces that have unde rgirded the economy during the last year, including decreasing mortgage rates, declining energy prices , and incentives to purchase automobiles, are unlikely to have a sim ilarly stimulative effect going forward.   Putting all of this together, while sympathetic to the fact that we’re facing a great deal of uncertainty, I would say that the ri sks at this stage—in terms of th e issues that confront us—are relatively balanced and we should be in a positi on to respond appropriately to incoming data.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Th ere’s a sense in which turning points present the biggest challenge to monetary policy.  When economic activity was strong as in 1999 or weak as in 2001, the required direction of polic y was clear.  The balance of risks was clear, and market expectations were clear.  When po licy has to turn course as in late 2000 or now, things become much more delicate.   First, there can be little doubt anymore that we are at such a turning point.  Throughout the past year the fundamental forecasting ques tion was whether housing and consumption could hang in there until the inventory and capital overhangs got worked off.  This was a question until and investment seems to have settled the matter rather decisively.  On the consumption side, consumption itself has been stronger than forecast.  The stock market is coming back.  Tax cuts have helped. Layoffs were not as bad as fear ed.  And now consumer e xpectations are beginning to rise. On the investment side, the inventory overhang seems to be working off very quickly, perhaps reflecting the warp-speed economy that a certain person he re is always talking about.  There could still be an overha ng in communications equipment, but even new orders for that category are leveling. Orders and shipments for computers ar e rising again, as are other shipments.  And now, like a fire truck arriving late  at the scene after the fire is out and spraying water all over the place, the Congr ess has entered the fray with investment inducements, possibly  magnifying the next boom.  Reflecting all this, the Blue Chip forecasters are revising their projections upward in a pell-mell process—so  much so that one wonders whether these forecasters are really forecasting or just  looking out the window.  [Laughter] This all sets up a difficult issue for monetary po licy.  It has always b een true that once we hit the end of an easing cycle we would have to  tread delicately.  We would not want to raise rates too quickly and risk snuffing out the turn around, nor would we want to tarry too long with rates well below equilibrium and risk inflation down the road.  That dilemma is still there.  But with every day’s news I find myself worrying less about the first side of the dilemma, premature rate rises, and more about the second, tarrying too long.  In late 2000 when we had the reverse of this dilemma we were able to turn policy around fairly quickly, going from a positive bias to an actu al cut in rates in about  six weeks.  The time pressures on us may not be as great this time.   We begin the process with high unemployment, low capacity utilization, and relatively quiescent infla tionary pressures.  Bu t things have changed example, if investment suddenly came roaring back  or if the productivity spurt raised profits and stock values, we would have to be ready to negotiate a turnaround and possibly a quick one.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GRE

[SECTION]

ENSPAN.  Finally, Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The information we’ve all seen since the last meeting indicates that the recovery  is here.  In fact, I question whether the word “recovery” is appropriate for the events we’ve been through an d whether we really did have a recession.  It clearly has been shallow and not a “V” or a “U.”  I think its shape has b een a bit more like a saucer. I’ve been focusing on some of the manu facturing and trade inventory information, and I’ve been surprised at how fast inventory liquidation has occurred.  Importantly, as a couple of people have already mentioned, the inventory-sales levels are back to where they were in the early months of 2000, which was the beginning of  this slowdown.  That would imply that business inventory positions are in good shape,  and I think industrial production is already picking up in response to that. In common with Governor Gramlich, the new fi scal stimulus package makes me wonder exactly what the target is.  This recession was unique in that it was caused by excess business investment in selected areas.  So to encourage more spending in the areas that already have excess investment seems to me a peculiar type of  recovery medicine.  Ba sed on anecdotal reports from business people I’ve talked to as I’ve been traveling to some of your Banks and other meetings I’ve attended, I wonder if a lot of the ex cess capacity that appears to be out there is excess capacity that is permanently shut down and will never come back.  If that’s the case, it    for productivity, since the idle capacity is like ly to involve the leas t productive resources. Consumer spending is continuing to grow, ev en adjusting for the unusual wave that was created between the fourth quarter and the first quarter due to automobile sales promotions.  Consumer disposable income looks good.  Income tax refunds are running way above where they were last year, reflecting I think both the tax cuts and over-withholding as consumers’ incomes fell during 2001. The productivity improvement in the fourth quarter in many ways shows that businesses were surprised by the level of final demand in  that quarter.  As we normally see during a recovery, productivity has increased. The pessimi sm about final demand that CEOs have shown throughout this period is one of the reasons that productivity has been so strong.  CEOs believed that if they couldn’t control the top line, then th e only way to meet their profit goals was to deal with the expense line. In fact, the more pol icymakers use words like “recovery,” the more I think that will tend to make CEOs and business people even more pessimistic, since obviously none of us around the table believ es that the recovery from th is period of slowdown will be anything like the recovery from a typical recession.  So any CE O who is expecting a bounceback comparable to those experienced in past recessions is going to be  sorely disappointed.       Finally, in terms of employment, if the unemployment peak is supposed to signal when we should start to change direction, then I woul d say that December was that peak.  I find it interesting that we now have discussions of a high unemployment rate at 5½ percent and a long-term NAIRU at 5¼ percent.  I would echo th e comments of my esteemed colleague, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Bo ston, who suggested that in determining the                                                        when our long-term inflation forecast is running well below 2 percent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you very much.  Mr. Reinhart . 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the materials that Carol Low distribute d during the coffee break. The resilience of household spending, the si gns of stirring of investment, and the significant slowing of the inve ntory run-off that have become evident in the past seven weeks would seem to reinforce the judgment that the Committee’s easing cycle has drawn to a close. The better news ha s cumulated to produce a 1 percentage point upward revision to the staff’s forecast of real GDP growth this year and has been associated with sizable increases in market yields all along the maturity structure, presumably speaking to similar substantial changes in investor expectations.  While there have been favorable developments of late, for real GDP growth to persist around or a bit above that of its potential will require househ old spending to continue to be well maintained—despite the saving rate being quite low—and investment to gather momentum, despite the fact that a recovery in profits has not yet been established.  Market participants seem confident that policy will be entering a tightening phase, but no one expects the Committee to begin it today.  That is probably because those analys ts appreciate that even a quick snapback in spending will take some time to whittle away prevai ling resource slack, and as a consequence, inflation should remain low for some time.  This would give you the opportunity to await convincing evidence on the underlying support to the expansion of final demand before you need to act to  preserve low inflation.   These considerations would seem to imply that the answer to the question, “When should the Committee begin removing the unusual degree of accommodation put in place last year?” is “Not today.”  Rather, the more pertinent question would seem to be how to assess the balance of  risks if the funds rate were held at 1¾.  On a surface reading of market prices, it might appear that the pronounced upwar d slope of federal funds futures rates implies that market par ticipants assess the ri sks to be so tilted toward inflation that you will need to begin tightening very soon.  I’ll offer an alternative interpretation that suggests that the structure of market rates may not be inconsistent with holding the f unds rate at its current level for a time.  I will then use that framework to consider a key stra tegic issue you face that, in turn, bears importantly on today’s policy choice. The string of surprisingly strong data on spending and production released over the intermeeting period prompted the 10 to 55 basis point upward revision to market expectations of the federal funds rate s hown in the upper left panel of your first exhibit. As a result and as plotted in the right panel, market prices now embed an 2 Materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).         notable features of this confi guration of rates that I list in the middle left panel.  First, federal funds futures rates move significantly above 1¾ percent in a couple of months, apparently signaling the belief th at policy will begin tightening on the heels of the end of the easing episode. What is puzzling about this shoul d be evident in the bottom panel, where I’ve split the path of the funds rate over the past two decades into the obvious easing and tight ening episodes.  As shown in the panel at the middle right, pauses since 1989 after a sequence of  policy actions were lengthy.  Second, money market futures rates climb almost c ontinually over the next  couple of years, implying that policy tightening will be exte nded.  But as the middle right panel also shows, phases of policy tightening since 1989 have usually lasted under one year.  And third, these expectations of imminent firming are difficult to square with the published forecasts of most market econom ists, who fail to foresee the sort of pressures on resources that  would require action soon. There is an alternative explanation that fits these observations on policy expectations quite well and that also may he lp to resolve these seeming anomalies.  In a regime-switching model, we can view mark et participants as expecting the nominal funds rate to return to a more sustaina ble level rapidly once the tightening process starts but hedging their bets as to when th at tightening will begin.  The top panel of your next exhibit gives a formalization of th is notion.  In particular, I assume that level or to begin tightening. Once a tighten ing phase is begun, everyone expects that the funds rate will be steadily, but fairly rapidly, moved up to some sustainable level with no reversals or pauses. Lastly, if the f unds rate has continued to be held constant in any given month, market participants assign a constant probability of switching over to a tightening phase in the next month.   This model can be fit each day to the exp ected path of the funds rate derived from futures markets.  The upper right panel s hows the evolution of estimates from this model of the market’s assessment of the probability that the Committee will begin to tighten next month. Although the current reading of an 11 percent chance of tightening beginning next month might seem  small, these probabilities must be cumulated when making forecasts several mont hs ahead.  As plotted in the middle left panel, according to current market prices there is a one-in-two chance that the funds rate will be rising six months from now.  The right panel s uggests how aggressive that rise may be expected to be:  Estimates de rived from yesterday’s closing futures rates suggest that market participants believe that once you begin to tighten, you will move the funds rate up about as fast as you moved it down—within one year—or about at the norm of the prior decade.  However, presumably because inflation has fallen in the interim, you’re viewed as likely to re turn the funds rate to a level of only 5¼ percent, lower than its level wh en easing started in January 2001. To be sure, you are deciding on the appropr iate stance of policy to adopt today, and what happens over time depends on developments that are inherently unpredictable, so you may view this inte rpretation as unlikel y in practice.       highlights a key strategic question you face:  What inflation rate would you prefer to prevail after interest rates a nd output have been realigned to  more-sustainable levels?  To get some sense of the possibilities, my colleagues in R&S who maintain the FRB/US model ran simulations, described in the bottom panel, that extend the forecast until 2007, preserving the key features of the Greenbook outlook.  Here is our opportunity to dig deeply into the salt  mines that Dave mentioned earlier.  The simulations used the version of the model in which workers and investors form their expectations based on past observations of  important macroeconomic variables.  These scenarios envision the consequences of moving the real f unds rate to its long-run equilibrium level of 3½ percent relatively  smoothly in one year, along the lines of the regime-shifting model.  The simulations differed according to when you are assumed to start tightening—next quarter, one  year, or two years later.  If deferring policy action for another year or more seems like a long time, I’d note that the cumulative probabilities derived from the regime-switching model imply the expectation of about a one-in-five chance that you will not have started tightening by the second quarter of 2003.  That said, very  little probability weight appears now placed in the markets on the possibility that you would hold the funds rate at 1¾ percent for more than two years. These simulations, shown in your last exhibit, put numbers on the obvious:  The longer the Committee waits to tighten, the more unemployment will be worked down at the expense of an ultimate  step-up of inflation.  What  these simulations show is how sizable those differences can be. Were policy to begin moving the nominal funds rate up next quarter—shown by the black line in the upper left panel—the drifting higher of the unemployment ra te to 6¼ percent by year-end 2003 in the middle panel would open enough slack to i nduce core PCE inflation (the bottom panel) to settle at around ¾ percent.  Delaying that proc ess by one year (the blue lines) or by two years (the red lines) would forestall that rise in unemployment at the cost of about 0.7 and 1.3 percentage points of higher inflation, respectively, down the road. The ¾ percent rate of core PCE infla tion achieved under the immediate tightening scenario would be as close to a working de finition of price stability as the U.S. economy has achieved in five decades.  If, despite the associated ¾ percentage point temporary rise in the unemployment rate , the Committee desire d that outcome, it presumably would communicate to the public that its near-term assessment of risks was tilted toward inflation.  After all, were your longer-run inflation goal to be ¾ percent, the prevailing inflation rate of 1½ percent would seem to pose a greater source of discomfort currently than the ma rgin of unused resour ces.  But you also might find some appeal in moving toward ri sks tilted toward inflation if you were worried that the economy could snap back more quickly than in these simulations, so that holding inflation aro und its current level,  let alone reducing it, was in doubt before too long—that is, in the foreseeable future.  The apparent turnaround in the prospects for investment, favorable news  on productivity, and recently legislated business tax incentives represent a real shoc k that may warrant a real response in        reported in the Bluebook rose as much as  ½ percentage point over the intermeeting period.  It is also possible that the Committee might not see much benefit in defining price stability as the very low outcome for measured inflation in the immediate-tightening scenario.  There were times late  last year when the prospects for the economy were sufficiently gloomy that the zero bound to nominal  interest rates loomed large.  Keeping a bit of an infl ation cushion might help to reduce those anxieties in the future in case aggregat e demand weakened to the point where a negative real short-term intere st rate was called for.  If  you’re comfortable with the prevailing inflation rate a nd think the Greenbook assessment of the underlying forces shaping economic performance is about right,  then either the st aff projection or the scenario I dubbed “intermediate tightening” would offer an outlook in the near term with perhaps only small net deviations from your dual objectives of maximum sustainable growth and pri ce stability.  Moreover, the odds on additional adverse shocks, which darkened the outlook just a few months ago, might seem to be considerably reduced. If so, the risks might be seen as balanced.  True, with the real funds rate close to zero, the Committee will ultimately have to tighten.  But “ultimately” might be beyond the horizon at which you deem the foreseeable future to end. The case for retaining the balance of risks toward  economic weakness could possibly be made based on the delayed tight ening scenario.  Were your inflation goal really to be that much higher than recent readings, you’d presumably prefer to make some inroads into current resource slack a nd might see the possibility of additional easing as not too unlikely. But allowing that  much slippage in underlying inflation seems too much at odds with what you have said and how you have acted in the past.  Rather, retention of the tilt toward weakness would more appropriately be underpinned on some combination of two beliefs .  First, these simulations, as well as the Greenbook forecast, might be viewed as being premised on too pessimistic a view of the economy’s ability to use its res ources without engenderi ng inflation—a point Governor Bies and President Minehan have made.  If that were the case, you could make those inroads into labor market slack  seen in the delaye d tightening scenario without the worrying drift-up of inflation—indeed, if you didn’t, inflation might get uncomfortably low. Second, you might be c oncerned as to whether the expansion of final demand will be well maintained, especially if market participants get ahead of themselves in anticipating tightening if anyt hing but the retention of risks unbalanced to weakness were announce d.  Essentially, you might have viewed the risks as balanced at the market prices that held i n, say, late February, but the rise since then— and the potential rise were you to change the tilt—might seem to you as tipping the scales toward weakness. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions fo r Mr. Reinhart?  President Parry. bottom two charts of exhibit 3, I think I would talk a long time  about the attractiveness of the blue line, particularly relating it to some of the studies we’ve had in previous meetings about the zero bound. I’m troubled, though, that that outcome  occurs by tightening policy a year from  now. I’m troubled in the sense that it’s hard for me to be lieve, and I don’t know if I can articulate that concern well.  Could you help me understand your analysis a bit?  I ask because I see in the forecast what I view as rather strong economic activity and, given the long lags involved, to wait another year seems to me to be extremely dangerous, although I clearly see big advantages to that alternative outcome.   

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. I think part of the answer, President Parr y, is that it is beyond the ability of our model to differen tiate between the FOMC’s starting to tighten a quarter or a half year from now and four quarters from now.  Give n the artificiality of the exercise I’ve done, it as each month went by and the Committee did not act.  So that is clearly a risk here.  I think the important point to get out of that true blue li ne is that it isn’t obvious  that policy action is imminent—that some element of delay is possible,  and I’ve put it in these terms to help frame the balance of risk decision. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. Very interesting. Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. MR. GRAMLICH.  Yes, I have a similar co mment and question.  I’m  typically a stay-ahead-of-the-curve guy, but I rather  like the outcome depicted by the blue line.  So you’re shaking my preconceptions a bit.  However, I th ink a strategy that a number of us might be comfortable with is to start ti ghtening fairly soon but to go a li ttle more gradually—not quite so   end result somewhere between the black and th e blue outcome shown below.  [Laughter] Actually, I think that would be my choice—the bruised choice.  

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. I would point to the regime -switching model, which I think speaks to two things that you’ve said. Firs t, it isn’t necessarily the case that market participants have a sharply delineated expectation of when you will start tightening. So I think it isn’t obvious—and I probably should have included this in my answ er to President Parry—that failing to tighten after a meeting or two will necessarily prompt a backlash in the market.  If the market has a 15 percent probability that you will act, then it has an 85 percent probability that you will not act.   The second part of the regime-switching mode l is the notion that the Committee can dip a toe in the water and the markets will  view it as purely that.  I think part of the attractiveness of a model like this can be seen in the experience of the tightenin g episode in 1994.  The Chairman went up to the Congress and told the world that  interest rates would be rising.  Many Committee members shared that assessment of the economic  outlook.  Fed funds futures sloped sharply upward. But as soon as the Committee started tig htening in 1994, those futures rates moved up.  Essentially, the way I would view it is that the probabilities in the market that the Committee would act were relatively high but that the act itself sent them a ll to 1.  The markets envisioned you embarking on a relatively rapid tightening ph ase and re-priced accordingly.  So there is a risk associated with taking some action and thinki ng that the rest will be deferred.  In my view the one opportunity in that regard, which some market commentators have noted, relates to the wide recognition that at least a portion of your easing actions involved in some sense taking out an insurance policy. Canceling that insuran ce policy isn’t necessarily a commitment to completely realign rates.    

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. My first thought when I saw this chart was “be careful what you wish for” because I had indicated in my comments that we need to talk about these issues.  I’m not sure I was prepared to talk about them at this meeting!  In any event, I would totally want to avoid being associated with the red line because I do not believe that two years is the appropriate waiting period now. I believe that our policy stance is stimulative, and I think we have to raise rates. And I do take your point that once we st art, the markets are going to assume that the trajectory will be fairly rapid. Even looking at the blue line, the issue that  I have is, Have we settled in on a number below 2 percent on the inflation side and an une mployment rate around 5 percent or so as being the ideal?  Or are we willing—since events put us  there in the late ’90s —to say that maybe some number in the 4s, the high 4s perhaps, is a be tter settling point for unemployment, given changes in productivity and given a whole ra nge of things that are perhaps different within the economy? I don’t know the answer to that question.  I just wonder about continually focusing on numbers for inflation that start with 1 and whether or not that brings into play the issue of measurement problems.  The usual assessment of the extent of the measurement error is around 1 percentage point. So if we really have a number that begins with 1, there is very, very little inflation in the economy.  Is that our goal?  Again, I’m happy wi th the outcome in the blue line though I don’t think we should wait two years before we tighten .  I don’t think we should wait even one year. I know we have to bring the funds rate up from th e current 1.75 percent.  The questions are when, how fast, and what our ultimate goals are. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. I think a message in the a lternative NAIRU simulation that Dave put in Part 1 of the Greenbook was that, if you believe  the NAIRU is lower than the staff estimate, blue line in the lower panel or better.  It’s just a question of what your assessment of the NAIRU is. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Right. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. May I make just one follo w-up comment on that?  It’s important to remember, though, that you don’t get to choos e what the NAIRU is.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I know. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. We don’t know what it is, but we don’t get to choose it either.  However, by virtue of the fact that we have to  write down a forecast, in  some sense a NAIRU is embedded in there.  But ultimately, as Vince’s middle panel of exhibit 3 shows, to stabilize inflation you’re going to be driven back to whatever is the equilibrium unemployment rate. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes, I know he had to make assumptions. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  I have a comment and then a question. The comment is that I think the diffe rence between now and February 1994 is that we have been so much more transparent, beginning around that time , when we initiated th e practice of announcing the decision taken at each meeting.  So I think the like lihood of our surprising the market to the degree we did then is very, very low or cer tainly much lower than it was then.   Turning to the model, which you explained very  well, Vince, am I right that the terms “right away,” “in one year,” or “ in two years”  as a policy model should really be viewed more broadly than that?  Isn’t it more  along the lines of “right away,” “wait a while but we’re not quite sure how long,” or “wait a little while longer though we’re not quite sure how long that is either”?  What I draw from this exercise is that essentially it’s a very good guide on whether we      less than a year. Is that right?

MR. REINHART. I would say that my c onfidence in the model is such that I contemplated not putting numbers along that axis but just sendi ng the message that it was now, later, or even later. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Yes. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Small, large, and very large. [Laughter]  Did you want to say something, Ned? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I wanted to echo what Dave said.  To reflect the properties in this model, the long-term unemployment rate has to be the NAIRU, which is 5.2 or 5.3 percent.  And if we should be lucky enough that the NAIRU is be low that, we could redo this exercise.  We’d get the same basic pattern, but we  wouldn’t end up at the same pr ecise rate of unemployment.  However, we do have to end up at the NAIRU, ev en though there is statis tical uncertainty about what that is. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any fu rther questions for Vince? If not, let me get started. This has been an unusually interesting meeting in  the sense that we are integrating our policy discussion with the outlook for an economy that is  undergoing significant st ructural change that will in turn determine where our policy should be  in the future.  Our problem is to figure out where that will be.  In this regard, the extent to  which the markets respond to what they think we think is a problem is in my view going to be an increasingly difficult issue for us to deal with as our presumed credibility continues to rise. As a number of you have mentioned, we are at a turning point, however we wish to define it. A characteristic of turning points is that, as the economy goes from negative growth to differing slopes imply huge differences in the performance of the econo my.  We are observing this interesting phenomenon where all the macro data that econo mists look at have turned don’t think in terms of the GDP data.  They look at their profit figures.  GDP  is a very interesting construct. It is the market value of consolidated output, and consumer markets and final sales sales and his costs. Typically, labor costs do not constitute a ve ry large part of those costs because most of them stem from purchased materi als, which reflect somebody else’s labor costs.  So the consolidated system that we look at is not the model that the av erage businessperson looks at. As a result we have to reconcile, as some of  you have pointed out, what  is essentially a really quite negative outlook on the part of the busin ess community and what we are seeing in the consolidated system.  I was at a Business Roundtable discussion not all that long ago and presented a GDP outlook that was not greatly diffe rent from what we’ve been discussing today.  The numbers were smaller, but the upturn was there.  My audience looked at me as though I were an alien from some peculiar planet.  The difficulty obvious ly is that we’re not going to get the economic performance that is implicit in our macro forecasts  if indeed the view in the business community is that profits are not going to improve, that pros pective rates of return on new facilities are not going to be adequate, and that pricing power is completely g one.  The reason, as we’re all acutely aware, is that consumer spending is goi ng to be only modestly helpful at best, and the major impetus for sustaining the expansion afte r the inventory investment upswing peters out will have to come from business capital investment .  So, translating all of this, the real danger what we may be getting at this  stage, and find that the surg e and the overall expansion have suddenly run out of steam. We have seen this pattern before. I rememb er being both fascinated  and disturbed in the early months of 1976 when the economy came out of the 1975 recession like a bull charging out of a stockade into the ring, and then all of a sudden the economy hit a wall.  The swing had been very dramatic, but there was no impetus left, and the economy slowed down.  Indeed, as you may recall, it slowed down enough that the Carter Ad ministration came in postu lating the persistence of a recession and proposed a fiscal stimulus package because that’s what they had promised during the election campaign.  But circumstances  changed, and they got laughed out of the box, if I may put it that way.  This is  the type of situation that I th ink we are dealing with, and it’s going to be very difficult to pinpoin t what is actually going on.   In one sense we have seen a dramatic acceleration in the economic adjustment process as information technology has increasingly affected the performance of the economy.  We ended up with a pattern of 50 basis point reductions in the federal funds rate when similar circumstances in the past would have called for 25 basis points.  Something happened very quickly to which we responded very sensibly in my j udgment.  It’s a fascinating issu e as to whether the upside ahead of us will involve the same pattern.  At the mome nt we don’t see it, but I must say that we didn’t see it on the downside either. The logic of  a quick economic adjustment process on the downside presumably will apply to the upside.  The argument against that is that, even though the economy has evidently gone th rough a period of marked in creases in flexibility and resiliency, we may be facing an outlook for inflation that is much more difficult to assess.  We currently are seeing price discounting, which is goi ng to go away because it’s essentially not cost     outlook for underlying costs, that eventually is go ing to reverse, and we are going to get some  price inflation largely because margins have to open up.  And as they open up they will eventually run into the same pr oblem they encountered previousl y, namely that labor costs will begin to rise.  But the initial impact in an environment in which there is great flexibility and great resiliency is that we will  not get very strong infl ationary pressures.   As we went through the previous downside period involving a dramatic adjustment process occurring very quickly in the economy, we reacted very promptly.  I don’t think we were fully aware of the possibility that we could be looking at deflation in the eye.  I think Bob Parry’s immediate reaction to the blue lines in Vince’s charts on alternative scenarios was a response to that risk. And when I looked at those charts I had the same reaction.  Do I really want PCE inflation to go down to 0.7 percent or something like that?  I woul d, of course, if I were sure that’s as far down as inflation w ould go and that it would stay ther e.  But with inflation at that level we would be exposed to a significant proba bility of deflation, and we would not have a sense that policy was in equilibrium.  In othe r words, we are looking fo r price stability, and I think quite correctly. And havi ng gone through this whole period, one could argue in retrospect that we may have moved too fast on the downside.  But we were facing significant risks in that period, and I think our policy moves turned out just fine.   My impression at this point is that we are of necessity looking at  something different.  This is a different type of economy.  This is a di fferent type of business cycle.  We now seem to be at a reasonably good point. We have come to that point in part by good policy judgment and in part by just plain luck, but I think it is one from which we can work.  My impression without getting into much detail is that short-term rate s in general clearly are lower than we may want to see long-term rates move up.  Indeed if the mortgage rate goes up, we will get some restraining effects on personal consumption expe nditures because a goodly part of PCE has been financed by equity extraction from the appreciati on in housing values.  More over, if the price of oil continues to rise, I think that is also going to constrain consum er spending to some extent.   So as far as I can see, the balance of risks is no longer tilted toward weakness; the risks clearly are about equal in both directions.  And I do think we may have a short period when doing nothing is the best policy a lternative.  I would certainly suggest that  we do nothing on the fed funds rate today. But I’m by no means certain about whether we will feel the need to move it up in May. Clearly one could argue that the pattern of adjustment in the economy has accelerated. In this regard, I th ink the risks of moving in 50 basis point steps are likely to be much too high. So we probably will have to mo ve sooner and in smaller increments, given our incomplete knowledge about the ch anging overall structure of the economic system with which we are dealing. My thought is that at least one way to get a leg up on the possi bility that we may want to move in May, without moving the balance of risks to heightened in flationary pre ssures at this meeting, is to indicate in our press statem ent today that we view monetary policy as accommodative, without any further elaboration.  That , I think, would enable us to move in May, if we choose, without generating an y serious reactions in the market s.  And if we decide not to move in May, that would be accepted as well.  By  the time of the May meeting, I think we will have learned a good deal about wh at is happening to inventory i nvestment and its impact on the economy and, of course, about trends  in profits and capital investme nt.  I’m not saying that we’ll know the final answers, but we’ll surely know a lot more about the direction.  So my judgment is  believe that our decisions are going to become progressively more complex.  The one thing we’re certain about is that the world doesn’t move as smoothly as Vince has portrayed in his charts and it’s not going to look th at way later.  Perhaps he should have taken the numbers off these charts!  Accordingly, I will put on the table the proposal that we keep the funds rate target unchanged at 1¾ percent and that we move the ba lance of risks statement to balance.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I concur with your recommendation.  And I would point out that if th e next move has to be up, which I think it will be, we can certainly move from a balanced balan ce of risks statement.  There is no reason at all in my view to inhibit us from doing that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Jordan. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Fi rst, as for the 1994-95 episode, I really don’t think that holds any lessons that would help  us this time because what preceded our first action then was quite different fr om today.  In that earlier period we had had, as I recall, some sixteen months of no change in the funds rate.  A nd part of the lesson then was that any change at all was huge news. This time it has been very rece ntly that we were taking overt actions.  Also, the last actions after Se ptember 11 are very well understood in the market as actions taken that we probably wouldn’t have taken in the absence of th e events of that day.  So to some extent we can distinguish between the reve rsal of the post-September 11 reductions in the funds rate and whatever tightening we might do after that.  With proper statements from us to the public, I think that first part is easier to explain and to do.  Beyond that, thou gh, I think the pace at which we move rates up may be asymmetric from the pace on the downside.  We cut rates rapidly because only gradually revised downward as businesspeople gain confidence, it may be appropriate to be gradual in a tightening phase even after a very accelerated, aggressive ea sing phase.  Having said all of that, if we hadn’t been at  all constrained at this meeting  by the bias toward weakness in our statement at the January meeting, I probably would be more enthusiastic about an increase right now. But I do feel that constraint is real.  So I think we have to  have no action this time, but at least set the stage for possible actions in the future.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, I support the recommendation.  I had at the top of my page of notes that this is probably the easiest decision we’re going to face for quite some time, which you pointed out as well. I also want to reflect just a bit on wh at we have ahead of us.  The fast rates will go up. We obviously don’t know the answer to that.  But in trying to produce a lasting recovery, it’s going to be important not to have a “disconnect” between what the market comes to expect and what we think we are intendi ng.  I am attracted to th e idea that Jerry Jordan mentioned about trying to condition the market to  the concept that we have some undoing of the insurance policy that we took out af ter September ll—that th at level of rates is sort of a baseline  steps. Just counting that out, it’s  clear that it could take quite a few meetings before we got back even to undoing the easing since September 11.

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Well, we could.  I’m not in  favor of moving between meetings unless there is some significant reason in the incoming data to do that.  At any rate, an intermeeting move would give us steps of 50 basis points, a nd whether they come individually in 25 basis point increments I think is much less important.

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation.  I’d like to make just a quick comment, following up on what Bill Poole sa id about how we would be looking at this process of tightening in the next few weeks and months.  In my view it’s important that our behavior as we move in this direction is symmetric with our behavior on the downside.  We eased policy very aggressively last year. I suppo rted that, and I believe it was appropriate.  In fact, one can argue that those act ions may have contained and rest rained the recession.  We were able to do that because we had credibility; our credibility was well established.  I think we now need to move as aggressively on the upside as necessary to maintain that credibility so that we will be well positioned in the future.    recommendation.  I would say that I like very much your suggestion that we use the term  “accommodative” in our statement because I be lieve many in the market will see that as something very close to a switch in the tilt by tw o notches to a tilt toward  tightness, which would position us if necessary to move the rate even before the May meeting.  It’s a long intermeeting interval, and a lot could emerge in that period, and I think we ought to consid er that possibility if we need to.

ENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I agree with  both parts of your recommendation.  I don’t think there’s any urgency to move today. I do think we can go from a balanced risk statement today to an increase in the funds rate in May without any problem at all.  And I, too, like the idea of putting in the statement some thing about monetary policy being accommodative now. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. Let me clarif y a point with respect to what I said to Bill Poole. Bill, my view of 25 or 50 basis point s is that I would think we’d start with moves of 25. We may have to pick up the pace.  Indeed, that ’s a judgment we can ma ke.  It’s just that I would not start with a 50 basis point increas e.  I think that would be disruptive. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I’m certainly in clined to go that way, too.  But I can imagine data coming in that would suggest that thi ngs are moving a whole lot faster than we anticipated and that a move of 50 basis points would be appropriate. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The burden of proof would have to be on a very extraordinary change that we really didn’t anticipa te.  At least that’s the way I would look at it.  President Stern.  one additional comment.  We’ve been looking recently at what I suppose I would generously call some low inflation policy rules.  While recognizing that beauty is frequen tly in the eyes of the beholder, the implication of these rules, at least at the moment, is that there is no need to move today.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, I certainly see a need to proceed as you’ve outlined today, and I would support that. I would add, though, that I think we could continue to see some fairly strong data and perhaps some data surp rises on the upside, given what we’ve experienced recently.  So I believe that having the accomm odative language in the statement is very important.  And in my view the possibility of an intermeeting move of 25 basis points should be a possibility that is out there.   If the market understanding is  that we’re not planning to do 50 basis points but that we may be moving sooner th an at the May meeting, I think that could be very healthy for us. I hope the press stat ement doesn’t foreclose that possibility. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Yes. You know, we’ve been very fortunate.  We have been able to move, with very few exceptions in the last couple of years, only at meetings.  That is not our history. We have been required to move intermeeting many times.  So it’s only if policy is extraordinarily well constructe d that we move only at these ar bitrarily scheduled times.  We hope that will to continue to be the case, but we  can’t assume that, and I suspect you may well be right. Governor Gramlich. typically easily persuadable by simulations, but I think I like th e scenario that you laid out— where we get started relatively early with sma llish steps, feeling our way—better than the black and blue choice [laughter] that Vincent gave us.  The latter might be black and blue in some  different ways. I would recall a po int that Jerry Jordan made earlier , and that is that if we raise nominal rates slowly, if the real rate is rising, we’re still being pretty accommodative.  So that might be another argument for getting started on a rate increase relatively soon.  But the one point I would note about the simulations is that they lowered the cost of delay below what I would have thought, coming into the meeting.  And th at’s an interesting point.  I’m not sure I’m ready to believe it, but it’s worth thinking about.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If there are no comme nts, I’d like to turn the floor over to Governor Ferguson who will continue our discussion on disclosure policy. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you very much. At our last meeting we had a brief and not fully conclusive discussion on the question of disc losing dissents.  The issue on the table was not only a transparency issue, but perhaps more impo rtantly it involved legal considerations.  From the standpoint of legal advice it a ppeared that it might be appropria te to disclose dissents earlier   memo from Kieran Fallon and Virgil Mattingly, which was se nt to you.  Also you received another memo from me regarding a discussion among a small number of us on how to respond to both the legal issues and the phi losophical issues about transp arency.  Since I’ve sent you a memo about that, I’ll try to be brief. The group of us who looked at this, which included Michael Moskow, Bob Parry, Bill Poole, Ned Gramlich, and myself, reached a couple of conclusions.  First, we propose that the Committee make one set of changes in its disclo sure policy.  Second, we suggest that a number of other elements of our strategy with respect to communications remain unchanged. The change that we propose is the one that is listed as item 2.A in the memo that I sent to you. That is to release the tally of the vote, the identity of the voters, and the preferences of the dissenters and to release all of that information as  part of the press statement.  Let me note the logic for that argument.  To be clear, we believe that adopting any of these options has some risks and some benefits.  So th ere is no option that is without concern.  We thought that the option of putting into the press statement the ta lly of the vote, including the names and the preferences of any dissenters, w ould get us into a position where we are no longer tolerating the element of legal risk that we face currently.  That risk is that we’re waiting for someone to ask a question, in which case we would have to disclo se the vote and perhaps be embarrassed that we hadn’t disclosed it earlier. At the same time, we viewed this as a moderate or middle step as opposed to some of the other things  we might have done, such as trying to create mini-minutes or to release the full minutes at a point that, while  not contemporaneous, would be closer to the meeting.  We are, if you will, f eeling our way here, since we have  no easy option of returning to  called 2.A option that I just outlined would be the best, recognizing that  there are some risks to it.   Now, we also felt that a number of things should not change.  We thought that we should not change the concept of a blackout period both before the mee ting, which was not on the table, but also after the meeting.  We fa vored maintaining the blackout for the rest of the week after the FOMC meeting, which is through Friday.  We thought it was also important that during the intermeeting period we not disclose the conten ts of the meetings—as we currently do not disclose them—and wait for the minutes to come out.  The third element of no change is that we would hold the release of the minutes until afte r the subsequent meeting.  That recommendation was driven by a number of concerns, some having to do with the mechanics of trying to get the minutes done.  Others related to concerns about  the fact that there is a great variety of information in the minutes, some of which may continue to be relevant and some of which may not be relevant. Another factor, obviously, was the sense that once we’ve made a decision to go ahead with something, we can’t go back. There is one other thing that would not be ch anged.  Obviously during the course of each intermeeting interval, after the blackout period a nd before the subsequent  blackout period there’s a time when we all give speeches and have discussions, etcetera.  We would at that point be free to discuss the economy or to discuss an outlook bu t we would still be expe cted to try to avoid going over the line of disclosing any actual content of or conversation that occurred at one of these meetings. So that’s where this group came out, and I hope  all of you have had a chance to read the memo.  At this stage I’d like to open the disc ussion up for any comments, first from the other members of the group—Presiden ts Parry, Poole, and Moskow, and Governor Gramlich—to who may have questions or may just want to state a point of view or pref erence.  Shall we start with Governor Gramlich?  

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Well, I would make just on e point.  The group was in agreement and Roger summarized the issues well.  But there was a question of whet her the dissents would actually be put in the press rel ease or would merely be availa ble to those in the press who happened to ask our Public Affairs staff for th at information.  I think our committee felt it was fairer to everybody, and particularly  to those who do not inquire, ju st to put everything right in the announcement and also to modify the way we announce the discount rate votes as well. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY. I think we came out at the right place in terms of the announcement and how it would be done. The only issue that I thought might at some point be worth more discussion is when the blackout should end. Ther e’s a certain logic to having it end at the close of the day on Thursday. Having it terminate at the end of Friday means in effect that it really ends Monday morning.  It’s no big deal. Sometimes it’s great to have an ex cuse not to accept a speech assignment.  But I think there is a logic to  having it end on Thursday after the release of the minutes. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Roger’s summary was excellent.  I would just  add that we had a very thorough discussion of all of the options, and I th ink it was a consensus th at this was the best route to go. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I think that’s true. President Poole. MR. POOLE. Yes, I think we were all in ag reement that if we could sustain the current procedure indefinitely, that would be great.  It works fine. But it’s not up to us to make that would be very unfortunate if this issue were  forced upon us by someone else putting a FOIA request to us. So to us, announcing the vote tally is  almost a “no brainer.”  We need to get out in front and do this in the most sa tisfactory way.  Staying with the current practice is just not an option. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Okay, let’s open the discussi on now.  I have Jerry Jordan next on my list. 

[SECTION]

MR. JORDAN. I would have preferred 2.B as  my first option because it involves the least change and brings the least attention to the fact of a dissent.  But I can live with 2.A, and concerned about the people who ar e not in the press room at the time we release our statement. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Cathy Minehan is next on my list. MS. MINEHAN. Well, I’m going to tilt at windm ills here.  I recognize that it’s tilting at windmills, but I do want to be on the record with my concerns about this. I have been in a lot of discussions about FOIA items.  This is an unusual one.  Usually the question is about whether or not information must be released or should be released.  This is a debate about information we already release on a routine basis.  So the debate is really around concepts of reasonable and prompt when applied to the timing of the information released.  I think Virgil and his colleague have  done a nice job of explaining to us how in the context of FOIA law “reasonable and prompt” can  only be defined as relatively short periods of time.  I also see the relevance of existing procedures with re gard to the discount ra te and other non-exempt matters.  But he also noted that some delay in releasing the information might be allowed if an   objectives. And here’s where I have questions and concerns. Clearly, we cannot, should not, a nd do not refuse to disclose the vote.  We already make it available.  But we, like all other central banks  that vote and disclose the vote, make that information available after the passage of some  time.  Why?  Well, to borrow Tom Melzer’s words when this was discussed in early 1994, it wa s perhaps so as not to focus attention on the minority view rather than the consensus view of  the Committee.  We’re a consensual Committee, to use Alan Blinder’s terms.  We release a vote th at reflects the best sense of the Committee as a unit at the time.  That is our objective at least in part.  To en courage the media and markets to spend time on the dissenters is to take away from that objective, at  least in my view.  Virgil’s note argues that not  disclosing the vote may serve to deprive markets of information that is useful about fu ture policy.  I think the reality is that that’s not always the case.  The policy decisions at the next Open Market Co mmittee meeting are not directed by the dissents at the previous meeting.  Events occur. Things change—sometimes relatively fast.  And people’s perspectives change as well. In  fact, I think there’s at least a chance that releasing the vote will serve to harden people’s opinions in ways that frustrate the op erations of the Committee.   If we make this change, several things could happen.  Members could become increasingly unwilling to dissent, dreading the medi a onslaught.  And in that regard, I question whether it is feasible to constrain members from speaking about dissents, even for as short a period of time as about a week.  The second thin g that could happen, on th e opposite side, is that members could find the spotlight and this extra bit of attention to their liking.  They might welcome the focus on the minority, which could cr eate real schisms in the Committee.  Of course, I’m not talking about present members!  [Laughter] this Committee and if we make information av ailable in a time frame that again meets our objectives—as do other central ba nks that disclose as much as we do—I don’t see why we shouldn’t be willing to stand up for those policies. If we get a FOIA request and are required to defend our current practices, I think we should do s o.  In fact, I don’t see how  we get out of this bind when the next step in this process is legi slation, as has been proposed in the past, on the desirability of televising our pr ocedures.  I don’t know how we get off this slippery slope if we go down it this far. How do we justify not bringing the television cameras in here?  I don’t see what it is that we’re going to be  talking about, with the possible exception of a limited amount of confidential material, that would be so highly confidential.  I’m not sure that anybody reading the transcripts of our meetings five y ears after the fact would be convin ced that what we talk about at the meetings here is all that confidential.  How far are we down the slippery slope to the television cameras?  That’s my tilting at windmills. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. I see where this proposal come s from, and I understand it.  I have a bit of sympathy for what Cathy was saying in the sens e that releasing the mi nutes earlier and delaying the disclosure of the vote until those minutes are released made a lot of sense to me.  That’s because I still believe that putting the dissents in context helps.  I know your committee discussed that option; I read th e memo.  I don’t know how the lawyers would interpret it if we got into an argument, but I think a case can be made for delaying the release of the vote until the minutes are available.  And the delay we’ve talk ed about is only two weeks, which is not an unreasonable period. But having said that, I think we  are in a bind as far as  releasing the vote at but to release the vote after the meeting.

These disclosure issues are always difficu lt, but it’s generally helpful for me to try to get back to basics and fundamentals when I think about these issu es.  The way I see our actions affecting the economy, both short run and long run, is basically  through the combined effects of what we do on the funds rate, what we say in the statement, the tilt, and all the othe r information we release as it relates to expectations and the yield curve.  Against that background, I think greater transparency is better than less transparency.  An d that includes earlier re lease of information in most cases. So I’m very much in favor of wh ere you came out.  I recognize Cathy’s point about the slippery slope. I see that th at has merit.  But I think there is some point where the slope is going to flatten out before we get to the TV cam eras stage in our room here.  Maybe I’m too optimistic, but that’s the way I feel about it.   Even if we go with the recommendation you’ve made with respect to an immediate announcement of the vote, I still think it would be a good idea—in fact this probably gives us more reason—to bring the release of the minutes forward, as soon as possibl e.  It might involve some additional expense.  But in the context of  all the other funds we spend on monetary policy and the private sector spends trying to figure out what we’re trying to  do, it’s probably rather minor.  So I would hope that we would th ink about moving in that direction.   

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Okay. President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. I’m comfortable with where you cam e out.  With time to think about it, it doesn’t seem terribly threatening to have the vo te released.  It’s far better than any of the   thing we need is another interim statement or announcement regarding our policy decision.  I share President Broaddus’s thoughts that if we could release the minutes earlier, even if it’s a week earlier, that might be desirable.  So that’s  something that I think we  still ought to consider and get back to. But I’m comfortable with where you came out. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Okay, thanks.  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES. I support the recommendation, includ ing the fact that I think the vote should be in the announcement as opposed to just available separately.  We get electronic information nowadays, and it’s easier for everybody to see it at the same time and in the same document. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Okay. I have nobody else who has asked to speak.  I assume that means that everyone else is—I'm sorry, President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Well, I can be very brief.  I agree with the comments that Al and Jack made.  And as far as the TV camera is concerned,  I suspect the ratings w ould be disappointing, to say the least! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Oh, I don’t know, it depends on our star performer here.  Are there any other comments?  No one else came to my attention. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. I agree with your recommendation. MR. FERGUSON. Okay, thank you. I think what this means is that while there are still some concerns—and no one will soft-pedal them or ignore them—we feel almost obliged to go down this path. The second question on the table is that we have the opportunity to implement this plan today.  Today may actually be a perfect time because there were no dissents and, as someone said, it was probably one of our easiest decisions.  So we actually have prepared the    thinking that perhaps this would be the way to go.   

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  Oh, Mayor Daley would have loved you! Guided democracy.   

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I would call your at tention to the last paragraph.   

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Is that the way it will be  done for the discount rate, Roger? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Yes, we’re going to change that, as Ned mentioned.  We will conform the discount rate approach to this one .  Currently the way th e press announcement of a discount rate change works is that a well-info rmed member of the press will ask the question about the vote and the Public Affairs staff will gi ve the answer.  So we think we really should conform the Board’s practice on discount rate votes to this approach for reasons that Governor Bies and others have noted. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER. What if there’s a dissent in this vote?  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. As Cathy has already indi cated, we’re a mature Committee, and we will not let these decisions influence our vote on policy.  Besides, the vote on the policy decision has already been taken.  Are there any questions or comments?  Hearing no objections, we will proceed down this path.  Obviously, for this mee ting after “voting for” th e names of all of the members will be listed; and after “voting agains t” this time will be the word “none.”   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let’s just say unanimous. MR. FERGUSON. All right. We’ll say unani mous.  That’s what we’re going to do. Okay?  Thank you very much. And thanks for your efforts on this one. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Offici ally we have to confirm the date of the next meeting, which is Tuesday, May 7.  Let’s proceed to lunche on or supper or whatever you want to call it.   topics at the June meeting.  I’v e gotten returns from about half the Reserve Bank presidents and Board members.  I’ll take any suggestions through the end of this week if the rest of you want to submit something or if any of you want to amend your previous submission.
