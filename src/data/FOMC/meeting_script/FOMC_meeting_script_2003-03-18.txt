CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  W ithout objection.  Dino Kos. MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the charts that were distributed a short time ago.  Since y our last meeting, markets have been characterized by a high degree of risk aver sion—driven, first, by uncertainty about the timing and extent of war in Iraq; second, by uncertainty about the underlying condition of the U.S. and other global ec onomies as growth forecasts were being trimmed; and third, by data on the real economy that tended to disappoint market expectations.  During most of the intermeeting period, investors favored government bonds; their yields declined to new lows in many cases, while equities fell sharply and the dollar depreciated.  In the last th ree or four trading sessions, however, many of those trends were partially or fully re versed, and the price of  oil has declined.  Some attribute these recent price moves to  investors’ optimism about the outcome of the war that now seems imminent.  Others  see the recent price moves as another variation of uncertainty, only this time the re sponse was to revert to a neutral posture vis-à-vis their benchmarks.    The first page in the materials distribu ted shows U.S. and eu ro-area three-month deposit rates.  For most of the interm eeting period three-month cash rates were relatively stable in the United States, as shown by the solid red line.  However, three-month deposit rates three, six, and nine mont hs forward (the dashed red lines) began to fall in early March, as the gloom deepen ed and the data deteriorated, especially after the employment report of  March 7.  Surprisingly, forward rates snapped back late last week and the three-month rate nine  months forward is back to 1.5 percent, near where it traded for most of the period.  Part of that reversal may have been due to technical trading factors, but the revival of equity prices and the growing sense that your meeting today would not result in a change  to the target funds rate also played a role.  European forward rates (the dashed green lines) continued to trade below the cash rate, suggesting that markets expect fu rther easing from the ECB.  Many market participants had expected a more aggressive  50 basis point cut at the March 6 meeting of the ECB.  The contemporaneous uptick in  euro-area forward rates suggests that those rates often remain influenced by th eir U.S. counterparts in the short run.                                                    1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  3 of 101In Japan, the announcement of a new governor  of the Bank of Japan did not alter expectations of persisting deflation.  With Japanese s hort rates at zero and the economic outlook unchanged, the BOJ’s continue d infusions of liquidity and a search for yield by investors have pushed funds out the yield curve.  The ten-year Japanese government bond yield hit a new low of 72 ba sis points on March 12; that compares with a yield of 1.45 percent one year ago.  In fact, the entire yield curve has been pulled down by the weight of the BOJ’s infu sions, as shown in the bottom panel.  While the BOJ’s so-called nontraditional monetary operations have successfully brought down the JGB yield curve and corporate spreads apparently have followed, still the amount of borrowing in the private sector and in  the securities market is limited, and prices on other assets such as equities and property continue to fall.   Turning to page 2, another way of l ooking at monetary conditions in major economies is depicted there.  The five gra phs on that page show the main policy rates (the blue lines) since December of 2002 for the United States, the euro area, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, along with the two-year swap rate for each currency (the red lines).  By early March the two-year swap rate was trading below the short-term policy rate in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Australia, suggesting that markets were expecting a weaker outlook and possibly some monetary ease.  In this c ountry, the two-year swap rate  fell 83 basis points from low of 1.33 percent on March 10.  In all f our cases the swap rate moved sharply higher last week—more than ¼ percentage point—as markets at least temporarily were willing to consider that the glass was half full.  Interestingly, Canada’s pattern was quite different from the others.  In Canada, swap rates began their turnaround at year-end, and the Bank of Canada tightened  policy 25 basis points on March 4.    Turning to page 3, the dollar continued to trade with a soggy tone for much of the intermeeting period.  Part of the dollar’s de cline was attributed to weaker economic data, which seem to have had a more pronounced effect on the U.S. currency than weak data had on either the euro-area or  Japanese markets and currencies.  The reason typically cited is the United States’ reliance on imported capital due to the current account deficit.  A second factor mentioned by some was the widening budget deficit forecast, and a third c oncern was the financing of th e war.  Traders recall that the United States was reimbursed for the vast portion of its expenses  in the first Gulf War, a factor that narrowed the current acc ount deficit at that time and was thought to have benefited the dollar.  A similar benefit is not expected this time around.  Notwithstanding this sentiment, the dolla r strengthened in the last week along with most riskier dollar assets.  The euro weakened sharply in the past week to about $1.06 as we speak, and European equities rallied.  Some attr ibuted the euro’s weakness to technical factor s; others cited discord w ithin Europe on both foreign policy and economic performance issues.  Still others pointed to the seemingly increasing volume of bad news coming from European banking and insurance businesses. To give one example, in recen t days there have been calls by prominent 4 of 101Germans for the government to prepare for th e possibility of having to take over one of the large German banks.    The yen’s exchange rate has been rather more subdued.  The middle panel graphs the dollar–yen exchange rate and shows (in gray) periods of Japa nese intervention.  Although claiming to have no exchange rate ta rget, the Japanese m onetary authorities have intervened consistently when the dolla r–yen rate has been in the 116 to 118 area.  During the intermeeting period, the Japa nese bought about $10.6 billion and €700 million.  That is in addition to the r oughly $5.6 billion they bought in January.  So-called repatriation flows, which actually cover a wide variety of book-closing maneuvers, tend to wear off by mid-Marc h as the necessary transactions are completed.  With the onset of the new fiscal year and a new team installed at the Bank of Japan, the market will be focu sing intently on the policy choices by the government and central bank offici als to revive the economy.    Finally, the dollar also has been weak since last December against other currencies, as shown in the bottom panel,  although it has had a bit of a bounce in recent days against those currencies as we ll.  The British pound has benefited least from the dollar’s weakness, perhaps in part  because of the suspicion that the U.K. economy is decelerating.  But some observe rs have suggested that the economy may experience some negative backwash from th e government’s decisions regarding Iraq.  Turning to page 4 and moving back to U.S. fixed-income markets, corporate bond issuance in January and February in both investment-grade and high-yield markets was fairly strong, in contrast with the lowe r year-over-year levels we were seeing for much of 2002.  As shown in the top left pa nel, the investment-grade corporate spread continued to trade below 175 basis points, wh ich while rather high historically is a significant improvement from October.  Actua lly, perhaps the news here is that there was no widening in the spread despite th e uptick in supply an d the weak equity the top right panel, especially among sele cted emerging-market borrowers such as Brazil, which has performed well since th e election.  Market commentary suggests that, with investors craving higher yields, these asset classes offered a fairly attractive risk–reward ratio at those sp reads over Treasuries.    Volatilities in fixed-income markets have re mained at somewhat elevated levels, as shown in the middle panel.  This panel graphs the implied volatility on options to enter into a swap.  The purple line graphs the volatility inde x of options of short-dated swaps, and the blue line depicts that measure for intermed iate-term swaps.  These instruments are the hedging tools of choice among large mortgage inve stors, and implied volatilities tend to rise during periods of heightened refinancing activity.  In recent weeks, the Mortgage Bankers Association refi index hit a new high—a level much higher in fact  than last autumn’s peak.  In that context it’s not surprising that implied volatilities among these instruments are high, and it may be a surprise that they are not higher still.  5 of 101The bottom panel graphs anothe r aspect of the refinanci ng boom.  The blue line is an estimate of the duration of the mort gages in the mortgage-backed security universe; the burgundy line is the yield on th e ten-year note.  These two do tend to move together since one way for investors to hedge a shor tening of portfolio duration due to a refinancing wave is to buy Treasur ies.  Conversely, they hedge by selling Treasuries when rates rise and duration exte nds.  With the signi ficant growth of the mortgage market, hedging activities am ong these investors can—and often do—have an impact on the Treasury market.  Now, I should mention that one small aspect of the recent heavy volume of refinancings is speculation that higher prepayments will cause a mismatch among some large MBS holders unable to adjust their positions quickly enough.  In particular, some trad ers apparently thought that Fannie Mae would report a much higher duration gap, as it did during last autumn’s prepayments wave, and that this would imply large purchas es of Treasuries and still lower interest rates.  In the event, Fannie Mae reported la st week that its duration gap for February had widened by one month, from minus four to minus five months, which was much lower than the market had expected.  And the gap stayed within Fannie’s desired range of plus six to minus six months.  Part  of the reversal in the ten-year note last week was apparently triggered by disappointment that this gap was not wider, which caused some short covering.  On the bright side, some have suggested that, with the spotlight on GSEs, they are hedging a bit mo re conservatively to avoid the negative publicity that Fannie Mae in particular ga rnered last Septembe r and October.    Let me turn to page 5 and a quick word  on reserves.  Several meetings ago I mentioned that currency growth had slowed  unexpectedly in late summer and early autumn.  The Desk responded by ceasing out right operations and shrinking our long-term repo book to $6 billion.  As currency growth resumed, in the holiday period we first increased the long-term repo book, and in the intermeeting period we resumed our outright purchases for SOMA, as show n in the panel on page 5.  During the intermeeting period we acquired almost $11 bi llion of securities, or just $1 billion short of the intermeeting leeway.  Looking prospectively, we do not  anticipate that the onset of armed conflict will have any significant effect on the demand for excess reserves or otherwise upset financing market s.  In a review of banks’ behavior during the 1991 Gulf War, there was no evidence that banks increased their demand for excess reserves.  However, analyzing that period is made more difficult because of the sharp reduction in reserve requirements that became effective in December 1990, a few weeks before the war began.  Noneth eless, we will be on the lookout for any signs that shifts in financi ng patterns or flows across a sset markets might be upsetting normal conditions in financing markets, and we will adjust our operations or provision of excess reserves accordingly.  Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations, and I’d be happy to answer any questions.

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Dino?  Governor Ferguson 6 of 101

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Dino, on page 2 you’ve show n us both the two-year swap rate and the policy rate for various countries.  I’m trying to understand if there is  any policy implication or meaning in the relationships we see in th e euro area, the United Kingdom, and Australia versus those in Canada and the United States.  Obviously in those first three markets the two-year swap rate has traded down, and at some points it fell below the target policy rate.  In a couple of cases, we’ve seen that  the monetary authority made some policy adjustments.  So how should one think about that relati onship, if at all, betw een the two-year swap rate and the policy rate, particularly in the cases where the swap rate has traded oc casionally below the policy rate? MR. KOS.  That’s a great question.  The Comm ittee spoke about the Canadian situation last time as something of an outlier, and one can see that here as well.  I think one way to view this is that the market probably does consider th e prospects for the United States and Canada as somewhat better than for the euro area and the United Kingdom.  The case of Australia is a bit more interesting.  I don’t know to what degree technical factors are involved there.  The Australian economy has performed extremely well,  and perhaps the markets are sniffing out a slowdown that’s not in the forecasts.  At least most forecasts that I’ve seen for Australia don’t show that its situation will become similar to that which the euro area and Japan are in now or toward which many people think the United Kingdo m is heading.  So we might be getting an inkling here that perhaps the market is indeed looking for a better performance prospectively in the United States as they are for Canada. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Are there any risk differentials between the two-year swaps and the government or central bank rate?  We’re looking at the shape of the yield curve. MR. KOS.  Yes, I could have used the two-year  note, but that create s a different problem of credit differentials among countries.  So, I decide d to take the two-year swap rate across all of 7 of 101these countries.  But I think we  would see the same kind of pa ttern—although the level would be different—if we used the two-year note.  The num bers would be somewhat lower because of the differential between the two-year no te and the two-year swap rate. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Incidentally, I’ve always presumed that the GSEs could essentially construct whatever dur ation gap they wanted and that the only issue was the cost of doing it.  Since Freddie tends to have a much na rrower gap than Fannie, is it correct to presume that they are willing to pay the insurance prem ium to create that gap whereas Fannie is not? MR. KOS.  Yes, I think that’s a good interpretation, and I believe  that’s the analysis that most in the market have made.  Interestingly though, one would have thought, that being the case, that Freddie would be rewarded with a higher  PE in its equities, but one doesn’t see that.  One could argue that they are be ing more prudent and are protecti ng against risk a little better, but that is not showing up in the way i nvestors are assessing their equities.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, aren’t there other factors that determine the size of the PE?  I assume profitability is one.  It doesn’t nece ssarily follow that the PE is not affected by the duration gap. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  The other obvious factor, Mr. Chairman, would be earnings growth.  A willingness to run your book with a little less insurance might also be associated with efforts to expand the overall size of the balance shee t and to increase earnings.  In fact, Fannie’s earnings growth has been fa ster than Freddie’s.  MR. KOS.  It has been faster because Fannie is  willing to take more risk, which is your point about how much insurance a GSE is willing to take out. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I think what is really happening is that the management of Freddie Mac—when one discusses this with their chairman it’s very clear— does 8 of 101not want to take as much risk as Fannie does.   In my view, however, the market is much too inclined to see Fannie and Freddie as if they’r e two identical companies and their PEs not being the same is a market imperfection.  Obviously ther e are various factors that can affect the PEs, but I think it is the case that Freddie is more c onservatively run and is not rewarded for it.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So the bottom line is that that’s bad judgment on their part? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  I think the bottom line is that it’s good judgment on their part.  It just shows that markets are not pe rfect after all. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bernanke. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Dino, my question is on th e Japanese government yield curves shown on page 1.  Would you interpret the decline in the yield curve over the last year as a change in inflation or deflation e xpectations, or is it a change in liquidity premiums as a result of the net supply of bonds and the demand for liquid ity?  Can you parse it  between those two? MR. KOS.  I think it’s very difficult to pa rse.  If you pushed me, I would probably say that the market in the last year has become more inclined to thi nk that deflation has become ever more entrenched.  Therefore, market participants tend to feel that the risk of being badly burned in the near term by buying a ten-year bond is low, which I think is probably a mistake.  So I’d say it’s probably more price expectations than the demand for liquidity, but  obviously it’s a very difficult issue to parse. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We do see the spread between the synthetic and the benchmark ten-year issues going down significantl y, which suggests that liq uidity is improving.   MR. KOS.  Yes, that’s an interesting point, and I’ve asked about th at.  One explanation I’m hearing is that liquidity is improving, which it probably is.  The other one is that we’re not 9 of 101seeing much supply.  Japanese corporations are still not borrowing, and in vestors are starved for yield.  One can buy a lot of government  paper at a return of close to zero percent.  So if one can get some ten-year paper with a 2 percen t handle, that looks pretty good—the risks notwithstanding. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  We don’t have any survey data or other info rmation on long-term deflation expectations? MR. KOS.  I don’t know of any.  Ka ren, have you seen anything? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  No, nothing that would go out far enough to answer the question. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you. MR. KOS.  It is interesting in one sense,  though, that the curve has been pulled down.  Interest rates are lower, and sp reads have come in; yet the economy really does not seem to be able to respond.  So it does raise the question of whether a flat yield curve produces better prospects for the economy. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  The other point I’d make, Go vernor Bernanke, is that in the indexed debt market in the United States, as the Chairm an noted, the ten-year yield is down more than 1½ points over that same year.  So we can’t rule out the possibil ity that what we’re seeing is a shifting lower of world real interest rates. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That’s certainly th e case with the TIPS.  Further questions for Dino?  If not, Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I move appr oval of the domestic operations, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objectio n, they are approved.  We now move on to the staff report.  Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson. 10 of 101

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  We faced some rather considerable challenges in assembling this forecast—the largest one, of course, be ing to find a way to be helpful to you in setting monetary policy in a period when the probability of imminent military conflict with Iraq has become very high.  Early last  fall, the Chairman commenced one of our pre-FOMC briefing sessions by asking whet her the Greenbook forecast was ignoring the elephant in the room—the  elephant being the potenti al for war.  We responded that we were well aware of that possib ility.  But we believed that a forecast constructed to take explicit account of military conflict would focus attention on areas about which we knew very little and would distract us from providing you with our interpretation of incoming data and the underlying forces operating on the economy.  Still, we recognized then that, by incorporating devel opments in oil futures and financial markets, our forecast was, in effect, reflecting the evolving likelihood of military action in Iraq.  Well, in this forecast, the room has b ecome very small and the elephant very large.  As you know, we opted for an a pproach that we think preserves maximum continuity with recent forecasts.  We have continued to take on board the path of oil prices implied by futures markets, current readings in financial markets, and recent measures of consumer sentiment.  These indicators, of course, embody a probability-weighted average of a wide range of po ssible outcomes, reflecting the collective judgment of market participants and survey respondents.  At this point, it seems safe to presume that they place a very substantial weight on an imminent war.  As events unfold in the coming days and weeks, r eadings on many variables conditioning our baseline forecast will shift, as outcomes currently embodied in that probability-weighted distribution become more or less likely.  Oil prices, equity values, and sentiment are almost certainly going to  deviate—perhaps substantially—from the paths assumed in the forecast.  We attempted to give you a sense in the Greenbook of those factors on which we will be most focused and some rough quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of the forecast to movements in those variables.  At this point, you probably need little  convincing that we don’t know what will happen in the weeks ahead with respect to conflict with Iraq or its economic consequences.  But, you may reasonably ask, what are the economic data and financial market developments of the past seven weeks telling us about the underlying condition of the U.S. economy as we head into  this critical period ?  If anyone’s hopes have risen momentarily that I will answer that question clearly, let me admit up front that I cannot.  A quick look at the top line of our forecast might suggest that we have learned a great deal about the economy and that what we’ve learned has been this year to about 2¼ percent at an annual rate, about ½ pe rcentage point less than in our January forecast.  But in point of fact, owing to an upward revision to growth in the fourth quarter of last y ear, the level of real GDP is actually higher, on average, in the first half of this year than in our last forecast.  One of the key surprises in the incoming data was that inventories were not as  lean in the fourth quarter of last year as we had thought.  Higher i nventory investment accounts for all the 1¼ percentage point upward adjustment to the growth of real GDP last quarter; final sales were 11 of 101about unrevised.  With that stockbuildi ng already behind us, we see less upward impetus to activity from this source in the fi rst half of this year .  Indeed, a smaller contribution from non-auto inventories more than accounts for the downward revision that we have made to our projection of activity in the first half of this year.  The recent data on spending, labor markets, and production have presented the usual mixed bag.  For the most part, the strength in spending that was apparent late last year carried into January.  To be su re, sales of new motor vehicles in January dropped off from the very high level obser ved in December, but other consumer outlays advanced at a rapid clip.  H ousing activity—both sales and construction—jumped to very high levels, aided by good weather and very favorable financing conditions.  In the business sector, orders and shipments of capital goods in January exceeded our expectations, with spendi ng for high-tech equipment posting an especially sharp rise.  But the picture in February and into March was not nearly so bright.  Motor vehicle sales posted another steep decline last month.  Snowstorms in the East evidently clobbered sales in la te February, but reports for early March suggest that there has been only a modest bounceback so far.  Faced with sagging sales and mounting inventories, vehicle ma kers have announced significant cutbacks in production in the second quarter—a sign th at they, too, are concerned about some underlying weakness in demand.  Retail sales ap art from motor vehicles declined last month as well, and this morning’s hous ing starts release—which showed single-family starts off nearly 14 percent, to 1.3 million units in February—can be added to the list of downbeat i ndicators for that month.  Readings on the labor market  and industrial activity also worsened in February and have shown little sign of improvement this  month.  We were especially struck by the widespread weakness implied by last month’s labor market report.  Private payrolls contracted by 321,000 in February.  No doubt, bad weather contributed to the payrolls more broadly.  But try as we mi ght, we could find no silver lining in that employment would be about flat early th is year; instead, job losses have averaged about 100,000 over the past three months.  Industrial production is also coming in below our earlier expectations.  Declines la te last year now look to be larger than previously estimated, and factory output is expected to eke out a much smaller gain this quarter than we had projected in January.  Although the declines in production witnessed last fall seem to have abated, there appears to be little upward momentum to manufacturing activity.  That view is supported by the available purchasing surveys, which have recently retraced earlier gains.  It is, of course, exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether this most recent softening in the data reflects underlying weakness in the economy or the intensifying effects of  war-related fears and uncertain ties.  Virtually all our major economic indicators at this point  could be directly or indi rectly influenced by actions or expectations related to the possibility of  war.  Is consumer confidence low because of higher war-related energy prices or because  the labor market is so soft?  Is the 12 of 101labor market soft because firms are hesitant to hire in advance of an imminent war or because product demand is weak?  I don’t know of any way to confidently break into that argument.  Moreover, I don’t think th is is a signal extr action problem faced solely by the staff and other economic forecas ters.  I seriously doubt that households and businesses can reliably disentangle underlying economic trends from effects related to possible military conflict.  Suffi ce it to say that, whatever the fundamental causes, the staff sees the economy on a some what shallower trajectory than we had earlier expected.  Moreover, a number of othe r factors led us to mark down a bit our projected growth of real GDP over the next year and a half.  For one, stock prices at the close of the Greenbook were about 10 percent belo w those anticipated in our previous forecast, and we lowered our projected path by a similar amount.  The effect of lower equity prices was only partly offset by the accompanying downward revision that we have made to long-term interest rates.  I should note, however, that the rise in equity to add back in much of the final demand we had taken out of the forecast.  Higher current and projected oil prices, especially over the next fe w quarters, are expected to take a larger bite out of household incomes than in the January projection.  Perhaps reflecting to some extent higher energy prices, consumer sentiment has weakened noticeably since the end of last year.  Consumers’ views of their own financial conditions, broader business conditions, buying conditions, and the labor market situation have all deteriorat ed noticeably in recent mont hs.  Sentiment has dropped by more than can be explained by macroeconomic conditions, and in the forecast we expect this unusual weakne ss in household attitudes and their effect on consumption to fade only gradually over the next year and a half.  Not all of the key forces operating on th e economy have been negative.  Fiscal policy, in particular, is providing more upw ard stimulus to activity than in our previous projection.  We have defense sp ending ramping up more sharply in this forecast compared with the last.  We ha ve added about $20 billion to projected defense spending in both 2003 and 2004.  Separate ly, we have retained the package of tax cuts assumed in the January foreca st, though we have delayed its projected implementation to the third quarter of this  year.  Meanwhile, tax receipts have been coming in much lower than we had expect ed, largely reflecting another year of unexpectedly large refunds.  Smaller tax pa yments are providing a noticeable buffer against weaker labor income in this forecast and help to sustain the projected growth in consumer spending.  Despite the small net downward revision that  we have made to the projection, we continue to expect a gradual acceleration of activity in the second half of this year and into 2004 for reasons that w ill sound quite familiar to you.  Stimulative monetary and fiscal policy contribute to the pickup, as does a gradual diminishment of the drag from earlier declines in the stock market.  Productivity growth shows no signs of flagging and should feed gains in both household incomes and corporate profits.  Finally, we expect the unusual restrain t on household and business spending, which 13 of 101we are attributing in part to pessimism and uncertainty, to fade over the projection interval.  As has been the case for some ti me, this feature of the forecast must be considered more art than science.  Even as art, I’ll admit it’s closer to Jackson Pollock than to Rembrandt.  [Laughter]  With slack in resource utilization persisting throughout the forecast period, core inflation is expected to recede modestly in 2003 and 2004.  Indeed, core PCE price inflation dr ops to 1 percent in the second half of next year.  In working on this forecast, we—perhaps like many others in the economy—have felt as if we were biding our time, waiting for events to unfold and the situation to clarify itself.  But how much clarific ation of economic circumstances can be expected?  Certainly, a quick and successful resolution of the conflict with Iraq could be followed by a sharp decline in oil prices and a jump in equity values.  Household and business sentiment could improve swiftly and persistently.  W ith just a short lag, some high-frequency readings on the econom y might provide evidence of follow-through to the real economy; initial claims , chain store sales, and reports from automakers would provide the early evid ence on that score.  With luck, those readings would be confirmed by broader monthly measures of spending, production, and labor market conditions.  While it is le ss pleasant to contem plate, circumstances could clearly indicate a much less favorable  outcome.  The use of weapons of mass destruction, substantial damage to the oil fi elds, or slow military progress could result in sizable adverse reactions in oil and fi nancial markets and a further souring of sentiment.  The consequences of these deve lopments could be reflected clearly in the flow of data on the real economy.  In e ither event, a significant narrowing of uncertainties would allow us to get a much better fix on macroeconomic conditions and provide you with clearer direction on the appropriate setting of  monetary policy.  But a third possibility seems eminently pl ausible—namely, that there will not be in the months immediately ahead a drama tic shrinkage in the uncertainty surrounding underlying economic conditions.  There are a number of reasons for suspecting that this might be the case.  Under the best of  circumstances, financial markets will be volatile, and the data on the economy will be bo th noisy and often available with only a frustrating lag.  It could take months to detect the economic consequences of the events that will unfold in the period ahead.  Moreover, the best of circumstances may not present themselves.  Even if the military situation concludes as quickly and successfully as it did in 1991, broader geopolitic al risks may linger in a way that they did not after the earlier Gulf War.  The threat of terrorist responses may not decline and could conceivably increase even in th e wake of a successful military campaign.  As a consequence, the current hesitance to spend and hire may not diminish rapidly.  Moreover, there have been additional sour ces of geopolitical tension in recent months—North Korea and Iran, to name just two.  We will need to be watchful of euphoric reactions in financial markets a nd among households and businesses.  Those initial readings may signal a more vigorous rebound from recent doldrums, but that enthusiasm could prove unjustif ied over time by the underlying fundamentals.  If so, the favorable initial reaction signaled by asset prices and sentiment would fade.   14 of 101Finally, there could be a real ec onomic bounce following the successful conclusion of a war.  Some firms might act on spending and hiring plans that were delayed by war fears.  House holds, too, may boost spending that had been deferred by worries about war and the accompanying high levels of prices for gasoline and heating fuel.  Witnessing such a rebound, however, will provide no assurance that the economy is moving onto a more persistently vigorous growth pat h.  If the underlying health of the economy remains lackluster, a temporary period of  above-trend growth could give way, yet again, to subpar performa nce.  In effect, circumstances might be similar to a year ago.  As the worst case scenarios following the attacks of September 11 failed to materialize, we saw a rapid acceleration of activity that could not be sustained by the underlying condition of the economy.  I don’t want to exaggerate in either direction here.  Clearly, we’re likely  to know a great deal more than we do now should a swift and successful military action be completed in the period ahead.  But I suspect that, even in those circumstances, you will see only a partia l lifting of the fog of uncertainty that currently shrouds the economic outlook.  Karen Johnson will now continue our presentation. 

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  In putting together the baseline forecast for the rest of the world, the staff in the International Finan ce Division grappled with the same issues that confronted those forecasting the domestic economy, but spread over a wide range of countries.  With the outbreak of wa r perceived by many to be likely and soon, a host of indicators and market variables abroad implicitly reflect the weighted average of market expectations as to the timing of  the onset of hostilitie s and the implications of subsequent events for economic activ ity around the globe.  Of course these variables also reflect developments in the underlying economic fundamentals, which no doubt have changed somewhat since we prepared the January forecast.    The clearest instance in which market e xpectations have provided answers to critical questions that we otherwise were at  a loss to answer is the assumed path for oil prices in the forecast.  As in the pa st, we have incorporated into the baseline forecast the futures path for crude oil as observed in the market at the time the Greenbook forecast was being fina lized.  That path starts with the price for West Texas intermediate at an average value of $35.23 for the current quarter and has it dropping more than $5.50 by the end of this year and nearly another $5.00 dollars by the end of next year.  Although some volatility in oil prices in the very short run is to be expected, a sizable decline in global crude oil prices from current levels, starting by midyear, is an essential factor in our baseline forecast for global growth. That forecast has some continued near-term wea kness giving way to growth at an annual rate of about 3 percent on av erage in the second half of this year and 3½ percent next year.  The implications of less favorable deve lopments with respect to oil prices vary somewhat, depending on how long the price of oil remains elevated and whether a given country is an oil exporter or impor ter.  We reviewed the staff model’s assessment of the effects of some alternat ives in January during the chart show.  A sharp spike up in oil prices that persists for two quarters, what we termed the limited embargo case, by itself implies negative effects this year on GDP growth in the major foreign economies that range from negligib le to a reduction of ¾ percentage point.  15 of 101Alternatively, oil prices could fall further or faster than implied in the futures curve, with positive effects on growth.  A second major factor underlying the forecast is the state of business and consumer confidence that is incorporated in  the forecast, but we  cannot quantify these variables in the way that we can for oil prices.  In recent weeks, confidence has reacted both to the changing prospects of  the onset of war and to news about economic fundamentals.  As we reporte d in the Greenbook, consumer confidence surveys have moved down further recently, particularly in Europe.  We are also looking for very sluggish or declining domestic demand in the euro area and Japan during the first quarter.  Nonetheless, our projection for an acceleration of activity abroad over the forecast period includes a strengthening in domestic demand in many countries that, in turn, is consistent with a moderate and sustained improvement in confidence.  A quick and pronounced move  in confidence in either direction, triggered by geopolitical events, could produce a significant deviation from our baseline outlook.  Sharply higher oil pri ces could well combine with a fall in confidence.  The version of such joint de velopments that I included in the January chart show implied reductions in growth ra tes of 1 to 2 percentage points in the foreign industrial countries this year.  A positive bounce in sentiment abroad is a clear upside risk to our forecast, and foreign r eal GDP has considerable scope in most countries to grow faster w ithout threatening capacity cons traints or heightening price pressures.  We have incorporated specific assumptions  about monetary policy actions in the foreign industrial countries,  which support the recovery of economic activity in our baseline view and are broadly consistent wi th market expectations for rates.  We expect that the ECB will lower its official rates another 50 basis points by midyear, as falling oil prices, considerable slack in the economy, and strength in the exchange value of the euro contribute to improvemen ts in inflation performance.  We have assumed that the Bank of England will move rates down another 25 basis points later this year as U.K. inflation also diminishes .  In contrast, we see the Bank of Canada keeping its official rate at its present le vel through the end of this year, as the Canadian economy remains near  potential and inflation dec lines from elevated rates thanks to lower oil prices and so me exchange rate appreciation.    Should developments surprise us and the markets and the outlook for activity diverge from our baseline, there is some scope for monetary policy abroad to react.  Clearly, lower oil prices, str onger confidence, and more-pos itive prospects for growth would imply stronger activity.  Such a deve lopment might result in the major foreign central banks choosing not to ease further.   On the downside, persistently high oil prices, even weaker confidence, and reduced  growth prospects might elicit immediate easing and more cumulative easing than we now assume.  With rates now at 2.5 percent or higher in the euro area, th e United Kingdom, and Canada, the central banks in these economies do have some ro om for maneuver on the downside.  The Bank of Japan, which we assume will keep rates at essentially zero throughout the forecast period, has been caught up in the problems posed by the zero bound for some 16 of 101time.  The Swiss National Bank has recently re duced its target rate nearly to zero, so it has little room to ease further using that tool.  Our crystal ball is least able to help us  anticipate the react ion of the foreign exchange value of the dollar to coming ev ents—a circumstance in which we often find ourselves.  In the days just before the Greenbook forecast was completed, the dollar reacted to downward pres sure that appeared to rela te, in part, to heightened risks for war in the near term.  We reacted to market developments by adjusting down slightly our path for the real weighted -average broad dollar index.  Since Greenbook day, however, the nominal dollar has re bounded somewhat—with the broad index rising more than ½ percent in nominal terms,  apparently on news that action in Iraq is imminent.  I hesitate even to offer a guess as to which way the dollar will move in reaction to future good news or bad news on ev ents in Iraq.  To the extent that the dollar turns out strong er than we have projected, e xports will be restrained and imports encouraged.  However, these part ial effects could be offset by effects on exports and imports from growth outcomes here and abroad that differ from the baseline.    We received data for the U.S. balance of payments in the fourth quarter after the Greenbook was completed.  Those data confirm that the ex post components of the financing of our current account deficit shifted during 2002.  Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities slowed from their record pace in 2001, and foreign direct investment inflows fell sharply.  These smaller private inflows were offset by a drop to zero in the appetite of U.S. investors for foreign securities.  Balancing these changes and the larger current account de ficit was a sizable increase in foreign official acquisition of dollar assets.  These shifts reinforce in our minds the judgment that market participants are unlikely to be willing to continue to add indefinitely to their claims on the United States at current exchange rates.  So we continue to put into the forecast a slight downw ard tilt to the path for the real exchange value of the dollar.  However, we recognize that over th e forecast period the do llar could in fact rise at times, and even on balance, as the host of geopolitical and economic risks now present in the global eco nomy are resolved.    My final observation is that the projected recovery in U.S. output growth remains among the most important factors underlying ou r baseline forecast for growth abroad.  We see various idiosyncratic economic funda mental factors in the individual foreign economies as shaping our outlook and as c onditioning the reaction abroad to near-term geopolitical events.  Nevertheless, a ny developments that would significantly change the outlook for U.S. economic activity would have major repercussions abroad.  David and I will gladly  try to answer your questions. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for our colleagues?  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I had a question, Mr. Chairm an.  But first I wanted to thank Karen very much for the memo she sent out a couple of  weeks ago.  That was very helpful to me in 17 of 101understanding some of the obstacles to adjustment  overseas in particular, and it related to some of the things you just said.  My question, Dave , is about the tax cut assumption.  I don’t know what it means to say “other things being equal” these days, but you retained the assumption that the tax cut will be passed.  My sense is that the probability that it will not be enacted, or that it will be pared down significantly, ha s risen recently.  I just wonde red what that might imply for your forecast. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Obviously that remains a po litical forecast, and it’s an assumption that I can’t say we hold with enormous convictio n.  I would point out that the magnitude of the tax cut that we have built into this forecast is  close to the figures around which the moderates in the House and Senate are coalescing.  That doesn’t  necessarily add to its credibility; it merely indicates that it is a magnitude that is still be ing discussed actively.  I would point out that we had built in a sizable fiscal stimulus packag e in December 2001, when the prospects for the economy looked quite bleak.  We took that out of our  projection in January of last year, when the political bubbling around that type  of package had simmered down significantly.  Then within three weeks the Congress passed a stimulus package that was almost exactly what we had projected originally.  So it’s awfully hard to know what will happen on the fiscal side.  I’m not even sure how the progress of the war would add to or subtract from the probability that the package would be implemented.  I can see arguments on either side.   Now, in terms of its consequences for the pr ojection, it’s a noticeable plus to disposable income and therefore helps to sustain the grow th in consumer spending.  So it plays a very important role in the second half pi ckup that we’re projecting.  If we  were to take that out of the forecast, we would probably sti ll be showing some underlying acceleration in activity, in part because of these other imponderables such as an  overall improvement in household and business 18 of 101sentiment.  But economic growth would be slower than in this forecast.  I do think it’s an important factor in supporting disp osable income in the projection. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry. MR. PARRY.  Dave, a common th eme of many forecasts is th at a gradual slowing of consumer spending, especially for durables and re sidential investment, will be more than offset by a pickup in business investment.  Somewhat in contrast to that, the Greenbook forecasts considerable strength in spendi ng for durables and for residentia l investment.  As a matter of fact, such spending accelerates in  the second half of the year, and expenditures for durable goods grow 8 percent in 2004 with market rates, on Trea suries in particular, ri sing.  I was wondering if you could comment on why the projection shows that strength and if you think it might be fairly optimistic. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  There are a few reasons that we think that by 2004 we will see reasonably robust gains in consumer durable spending.  One is the overall interest rate environment in this forecast, which I think is generally more favorable than in the consensus forecast.  We have built in no increase in the federal funds rate through the end of 2004 and we have—  

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  There is a mention of an increase in Treasury rates. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  There’s a litt le drifting up in Treasury rate s, which is offset in our view by a compression of private spreads as the overall economy improves.  Two, we’re expecting the relative price of durable goods to c ontinue to decline and to  decline quite rapidly. In essence, we think the user cost of purchasing those goods will be relative ly low.  Three, it’s also a reflection of our estimate for potential ou tput growth, which is st ill obviously to the high side of the consensus forecast.  I think that he lps to sustain overall growth in household incomes 19 of 101as well as in corporate profits a nd therefore provides some boost.  So we believe there are logical fundamentals for why consumer durables spending  should increase.  I must say on the housing side that we also have very fa vorable mortgage interest rates.  That could be a little on the optimistic side in light of this morning’s data release and a few readings recently of just a bit more softness there.  I’m not so sure, had we had all of that information before we did our forecast, that we would have been quite so optimistic on the housing investment side. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Dave, let me ask a question about the structural labor productivity chart.  In your forecast, the contribution from capital deepening stays relatively low going forward, and yet the multifactor productivity numbers remain fa irly strong.  You also talked about the slump in investment spending.  What is your thinking on the multifactor aspe cts of productivity and why it will stay so strong as we go forward? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Our basic thinking has been that one needs to resort to a supposition of reasonably strong multifactor productivity to  explain the incredib le strength in labor productivity that we’ve had over th e past two years.  If anything, our straightforward statistical filtering models would want to put in more mult ifactor productivity growth than we’ve written down in this forecast.  Now, obviously this involves some fairly big risks.  Maybe this productivity improvement in the last year and a half  will turn out to have been, in essence, some significant cyclical rise in pr oductivity, as firms are squeezi ng harder on their productive facilities and on their work ers to eke out more productivity ga ins.  As you know, in the initial phase of this more recent acceler ation of productivity, that was generally the story that we bought into.  But we’ve been beaten down by the data quarter after quarter, suggesting that we 20 of 101have to give a little weight in this forecas t—and we have—to the possibility that multifactor productivity has continued to improve.  We ha ve it at roughly 1½ percen tage points, which by the historical standards of the past 100 years is not an especially large figure. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  The only reason I was asking is that, with a holding back in investment and therefore limited gains from new technology, I wondered whether we can continue to harvest that.  I don’t disagree with you because it’s hard to explain otherwise.   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I think you’re right, though.  Obviously, if whatever is holding back investment spending were to persist longer than we  have projected in this forecast, it would be harder in some sense to embody technological improvements going forward.  That could have some follow-through effects on multifactor productivity as well. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought Dave and Karen did a fabulous job, both in the written material  and in the presentation, of co vering in effect the entire waterfront of risks and possibilities to consider as we sit here and try to determine how this situation is going to turn out.  I know I was impressed by the comp lexities involved in trying to do it over the past couple of weeks.  You certainly have indicated how varied the possibilities are and how great the risks are—perhap s on both sides.  That brings me to the question I would like to pose. Looking just at the Greenbook baseline forecast,  absent the alternative simulations and absent the really interesting di scussion of ups and downs and ins and outs of oil prices and whatnot, it seems to me that one would have to say—though I know  you won’t say this—[laughter] that the risks almost have to be  on the downside of th e Greenbook projection.  21 of 101Everything has to go very well for that forecast to work out.  The war has to be short, and it has to be relatively cheap.  Consumers and businesses have to leap right back into the saddle.  Even if everything works out so well th at this forecast does materialize,  then we still have a good deal of excess capacity lingering on through 2004.  Aren’t the risks on the downside?   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Well, you’re right that  I’m not going to concede that point immediately.  [Laughter]  In fact, one of the things  that we did in preparation for this forecast was to look at some of what we call good cas e and bad case scenarios.  As you know, our forecast is not based on all the good things that would necessarily follow from a quick resolution of the conflict because the probability distribut ion that the forecast is predicated upon includes some negative outcomes.  So suppose in the next  few weeks we do have a swift and successful completion of the military campaign.  Oil prices could tumble and perhaps tumble considerably in the near term—and even in the longer term based on what th e futures markets are currently expecting.  We could get a much sharper and more immediate snapback in consumer and business confidence.  We have built in a gradual rebound in confidence.  In the case of households, the hit on confidence th at we’ve seen doesn’t erode until sometime next year, and on the business spending side that does not occur un til the end of this year.  Suppose that happened more immediately.  One could eas ily envision—maybe we’ve alrea dy seen it to some extent—a pop in equity markets and some of the risks th at were weighing on mark ets going away.  We fed those types of assumptions into the model, and it was easy to get an extra percentage point on GDP by the end of 2004 and ½ percentage point less on the unemployment rate.  So I think there is a probability mass on the upside. Now, there are some obvious and rather signifi cant risks to the downside as well, and I hope I hinted at them in my remarks.  Certainl y, one could envision all so rts of bad outcomes in 22 of 101Iraq.  But even putting aside those risks, a chunk of this forecast relies on an improvement in investment spending—essentially whatever has b een depressing investment spending goes away.  There is not a lot of science one can bring to bear on that, so ther e are downside risks associated with that forecast.  We saw a pattern of strength around the turn of the year followed by weakness, but it is hard to do a signal extraction from that.  The recent data have been quite soft, and we see nothing yet in the data that hints at the acceleration in activity that we’re forecasting.  It looks to us as if the economy is just conti nuing to move along at this subpar baseline rate of growth, but we don’t see many signs that things are falling apart either.  So if you were hoping to pin some of our forecast on developments that we actually are able to put our fingers on, we can’t do that.  It still involves more forecast than anything apparent in the direct economic readings. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I ha d a question for David also on the risks to the forecast.  I notice that in your forecast th e personal saving rate increases and then flattens out during 2004.  Historically, the saving rate is a couple of percen tage points higher than that rate.  I had two questions on this.  First, is that where you would expect it to settle on a longer-term basis?  Second, how serious is the risk to th e forecast that the saving rate will actually be higher during this period? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Our best guess is that we still have a little way to go on the saving rate, but not a lot further, in re sponse to the deterioration that has occurred in household balance sheets.  We have models that put the saving ra te anywhere between 5 and 7 percent in the long run, but I think somewhere around 6 percent or just north of that is  probably the right territory.  23 of 101The question is how do we get there?  Second, c ould we get there more rapidly than we have projected?  Obviously, the answer to the second question is “yes, we could.”  But I do not see that as much of a concern.  Households have been subjected to a number of very significant shocks over the last couple of years—the substa ntial decline in the stock market, the recession, and the terrorist attacks—and none of them seemed  to result in a pullback on the spending side, a big increase in precautionary savi ng.  The combination of all of those developments didn’t seem to produce an unusual jump in the saving rate.  Given the uncertainty th at people are facing in the events ahead of us, maybe we will see a pick up in the saving rate.  But I don’t quite see that happening exogenously.  In many respects I’d say that consumption has followed our model quite closely, which suggests a considerable la g in the adjustment of  household spending to deterioration in consumer balance sh eets.  So I think it’s a risk but not one that I’d put at the top of the list of risks that  we’re facing.  But obviously, going forw ard, one could picture events that could engender the kind of fear or concern on th e part of households th at could produce a higher rate of precautionary saving.  That matters a lot in  our forecast.  If we were to get a significant step-up in the saving rate relative to our baseline  forecast, that would weigh very heavily on the outlook going forward. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  I have a brief comment on that.  There are a lot of news reports about companies canceling their contributions to 401(k) plans as an economy move.  That might lead individuals to reduce their cont ributions, which would tend to bring the saving rate down.  I don’t know how extensive that is, but we certainly hear reports that many companies are moving in that direction now. 24 of 101

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  We’ve heard those reports as well.  I’m not quite sure how that would net out or quantitatively how si gnificant it would be at this point.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If nobody else ha s questions or comments, who would like to start the discussion ?  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Fo r a while in January it looked as if activity was strengthening moderately in our region, especially in the manufacturing sector.  That made us something of an outlier in the commentary  in the Beige Book, but we fell back in line in sharply for the most part last month.  Some of that obviously was related to the heightened war anxiety and concern about rising ga soline prices.  The severe weather in February, particularly around the Presidents’ Day weekend, hit our Dist rict especially hard and clearly played a significant role in the apparent so ftening.  That is good news, I guess,  if it suggests that at least some of the softening was transitory rather than  persistent.  Unemployme nt rates were below the national level in several of our District states, but the rate in No rth Carolina, which is our largest state, was at almost 7 percent in December—th e latest month for which we have data—because of the weakness in manufacturing there.   Not all of the news in our District is bad.  There have been a few fairly substantial plant expansions in our region, indicating at least some in crease in business spending.  As for housing activity, the national report for this  past month was weak.  I don’t recall what the regional profile was in that report, but we don’t see any significant  weakening in housing activity in our District.  Also, let me mention one particular bright spot in  the manufacturing sector.  The Fifth District is one of the world’s leading producer s, if not the leading producer, of  duct tape.  [Laughter]  That industry is doing very well, thank you.  We gained our duct tape prominen ce because the original 25 of 101fiber used to give the tape strength was cotton.  Jack Guynn’s people grew it, and we manufactured it.  So that’s a little Southern economic history lesson for you this morning at no charge! Turning to the national economy, I would describe the Greenbook forecast as easy to love, all things considered, and I hope we get something that’s at least in the nei ghborhood of it.  The question, of course—there ar e a lot of questions, but this  a key one—is whether we can reasonably expect such a relatively favorable outcome with th e funds rate at a sustained 1¼ percent level, as is assumed in the baseline  forecast.  Obviously, no one knows the answer to that in the current highly uncertain situation but  my own view is that  the Greenbook forecast is plausible.  Clearly, the economy is struggling cu rrently under the weight of all the uncertainty, and the downside risks are obviously material.  Ne vertheless, in some contrast to my neighbor Cathy here, I think it’s easy to exaggerate bot h the current weakness and the downside risks in the outlook, considerable though they are.  I certainly recognize that  they are considerable.  As the Greenbook points out, a persistent  increase in oil prices could l ead to a significant slowing in economy activity.  But as we’ve said already th is morning, futures mark ets are not expecting that.  If we don’t get a persistent increase in o il prices, I think that si gnificantly reduces the likelihood that the most recent weakness in labor  markets and retail sales will cumulate and worsen.  Moreover, looking through the recent data, the prospect of continued robust trend productivity growth should eventually produce some revival of investment and should support commensurate growth in household spending.  The stimulative monetary and fiscal policies that are already in place both support the adjustment process.  We’re alrea dy seeing at least some revival of investment in some s ections of the tech sector.   26 of 101Finally, our credibility for low inflation m eans that neither rising actual inflation nor rising inflation expectations pose much of a risk for the recovery.  So I think we have a solid underlying base for recovery.  To be sure, we ma y experience some sort of disinflation if the economy continues to adjust to the higher trend productivity grow th.  That could pose some complications in the transition, and I think we need to monitor that  carefully.  Outright deflation doesn’t appear to be a strong threat at this poi nt.  But I continue to think that this Committee should be prepared to deal with  the risk of deflation if unfav orable developments such as a protracted war in Iraq or some negative shock or succession of negative shocks—like a series of terrorist attacks, for example—force us closer to the zero bound.  I’d like to come back to that later for just about a minute when we have our policy go-around.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our views regarding the Second District, the nationa l economy, and the internatio nal economy are all clouded by uncertainties.  So rather than sh aring our confusion about those th ree subjects, I’d like to talk about the uncertainty.  What we do not know is the degree to whic h that uncertainty is really geopolitical.  As for a war against Iraq, the ne ar certainty of quick military victory and the aftermath of a more stable Middle East are the very positive hopes.  Unfortunately, the more conversations I have with people who know about the Middle East, the less certain they are of a stable aftermath.  I think it is almost certain th at we’ll be very successful militarily.  However, there is not a single neighboring coun try of Iraq that can be deemed to be stable, so the shock of a military attack against their neighbor could bring about very uncertain consequences either sooner or later.  Therefore, I believe that the geopolitical uncertainty is likely to remain.   27 of 101In my view, a considerable amount of th e uncertainty voiced by American business leaders in the name of geopolitics is in fact a cover story for their concern about the direction of the economy.  They are not certain whether the cons umer will hang in there as we hope he will.  They aren’t certain whether it is a good idea to make the business fixed in vestment decisions that our forecasts call for.  The effect on them of the Enron/Arthur Andersen /WorldCom debacles is that it is much easier to avoid making decisions  than to make them.  If you as a business executive make a decision, even if you happen to be right, the board of dir ectors or shareholders wrong, those very same directors and shareholders can punish you severely.  On the other hand, if you do nothing, you appear to be studious and virtuous.  Now, no economy can prosper and no business can prosper if that degree of caution co ntinues for any extended period of time.  But it doesn’t have to continue for very long to make the downside of our forecast turn out to be likely. One thing that I think could militate against that is if the war is very successful very quickly, as I think it will be, and if the adverse ge opolitical aftermath is later rather than soon and therefore the situation looks very  good for a while.  Then I think our President, with his rather remarkable leadership skills, could turn those skil ls to the economy, and we could see a burst of confidence stemming from the notion that somebody is really in charge.  If you’ve been in charge and have just won a war, that shows fo rmidable leadership.  I think that could well happen, and obviously by mentioning  it, I rather hope it does.   In the midst of all this uncerta inty what does a prudent central  banker do?  It seems to me that a prudent central banker thi nks a lot, does nothing, talks as little as possible, and makes it very clear that the central bank is very attentiv e and ready to take acti on when and if required.  Thank you. 28 of 101

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, economic activit y in the Tenth District, as in other regions, remains basically sluggi sh, though we have had a few si gns of improvement on mixed data since the last meeting.  Retail sales have  increased only slightly  from the disappointing holiday season, and commercial real estate is still mired in a very deep slump in our area.  On the positive side, though, manufacturing activity actually  has strengthened a l ittle since the last meeting, and energy activity has picked up noticeab ly.  Housing continues to provide support to District activity, with solid sales of low-end homes making up for some slump in the high-end part of that market.  On the in flation front, wage and price pressu res obviously remain pretty well subdued. In speaking with our directors and with a lot of business pe ople throughout our  District, I consistently hear that businesses are reluctan t to commit to new spending and hiring until the uncertainty of the current situation with Iraq is resolved.  This wait-and-see attitude also describes consumer sentiment more and more as it relates to new spending.  However, not to overstate this uncertainty factor, I would also note that in Colorado, for example, attitudes are distinctively pessimistic and very much unrelated to the war.  Many people in that state see very strong parallels between now and the slump that they went through in the 1980s, with a lot of excess capacity and a lot of  pessimism in play.   Let me talk a little more about manufacturing activity because it actually showed some improvement on balance in February.  Production and shipments rose above year-ago levels, and new orders registered a fairly large increase—in fact one of the largest since early 2000.  Firms continue to express optimism about production and sales over the next six months once we get through some of this immediate geopolitical uncertainty.  However, employment and capital 29 of 101spending has remained well below year-ago levels, and firms are keeping their inventories low in case the higher sales they expect do not materi alize.  In our survey about attitudes among manufacturers, it is a fact that as they look forward they are more  optimistic, as they feel they can get through this immediate crisis .  So I think there is  that element.  But, again, I go back to Colorado as evidence that other factors are operating as well. Let me talk very quickly about the farm economy, which is actually expected to strengthen in 2003.  Farm income in terms of cas h receipts is expected to improve, and farmers also are going to continue to receive government  payments.  Commodity pr ices could fluctuate, though, because we continue to have a fairly seve re drought in the central and western plains of our region, which is bringing a lo t of its own uncertainty in th e agricultural production sector. Let me turn to the national scene.  The broad contours of our economic outlook have changed little since the last meeting.  We still expect near-term weakness and medium-term strength.  Like the Greenbook, we e xpect growth to be about 2½ per cent in the first half and then to increase to 4 percent as we move forward, re cognizing that the error bands around that kind of forecast are fairly large.  But the reason is—a nd I don’t think we should lose sight of it—that monetary policy is still stimula tive, fiscal policy is stimulative and could become more so, and we have financial market conditions and a banki ng industry that are generally able to be supportive of an expansion.   The factors behind the near-term weakness remain  the same as at our last meeting.  Oil prices and geopolitical risks have fostered near-term restraint.  As these risks and uncertainties are lifted—perhaps in the next  couple of weeks or months but  maybe even in the next few days—I think we’ll be able to assess how these elements of m onetary policy and fiscal policy might play out in the real economy.  At leas t by waiting a little longe r we should also be 30 of 101allowing more light in the room to see by as we  think about policy.  So my suggestion would be in line with the Vice Chairman’s—namely, that we  might be well served to wait and watch as more light is shed on the situation.  It will put us in a better position to make decisions.  As far as how we couch our policy decision, I believe we  should be very careful about making any changes.  I think we will have an interesting discu ssion in the policy port ion of this meeting about what we say in our press stat ement.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I suspect everybody will note before the morning is over, it has proved particularly diffi cult to get our arms around what’s happening in the economy generally.  That’s certainly the case mo re specifically in our ow n District.  The data and the anecdotal evidence are contradictory in some respects, and the messages regarding the impact of geopolitical uncertainty on corporate and consumer decisionmak ing are not completely clear.  For example, last week we met with our  Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor Advisory Council and the rhetoric at best was somber, especially from the manufacturing sector.  Even so, we had a Florida architect in the group who sa id he was forced to turn away business and recently had expanded his staff.  The heads of a small accounting firm and a small engineering firm reported difficulties hiring qualified accountan ts and engineers respectively.  A computer support and systems supplier indi cated that business was good and that he has recently been adding employees.  And a pallet manufacturer indi cated that demand had improved slightly.  The point is that how people were f eeling and the realities of their business activities didn’t always match.  Of course, there’s always a danger in at tempting to generalize from such anecdotes, but our discussions in that group didn’ t provide a clear indi cation of continued de terioration in the economy. 31 of 101We specifically asked our six boards of dir ectors, which met last week and the week before, to question their contac ts about three related issues:  the impact of geopolitical uncertainty on hiring and investme nt; the amount of excess capacity  that existed and how much demand would have to pick up before hiring and investment would resume; and what was happening in commercial real estate.  The commerci al real estate situation is the easiest to summarize.  Activity remains dead in Atlanta and many of our other major cities.  Furthermore, it is slowing or softening in thos e parts of our District that had been doing rather well last year, mainly south Florida and Louisiana.  As for th e capacity issue, the firms that reported to our directors are saying that  demand would have to pick up between 10 and 20 percent before hiring and investment would resume and their businesses would return to what they consider normal.  Finally, it’s clear that uncertainty is weighing more and more h eavily on short-term investment of which reflect a mix of fundament als and fears that will have to  be reversed before hiring and investment accelerate. I have several quick final comments about our  region.  First, residential housing remains strong, but increasingly concerns ar e being expressed that pockets of overbuilding are appearing, especially in the multifamily sector.  Moreover, additional softness is showing up in the high-end single-family market and in south Florida even  in the middle-market segment.  Second, we recently received reports of a further slowdown in tourism, especially for the cruise industry out of South Florida—even though they’ve begun offe ring some significant fare discounts.  Third, despite higher oil and gas prices, the Gulf of Mexico is essentially  a dead sea as far as drilling and exploration are concerned, re flecting uncertainty about the l onger-term prospects for energy prices.  Fourth, higher fuel pri ces are reportedly having significan t short-term effects on costs in 32 of 101many industries.  One of our directors, a trucking executive, reported on an industry study that suggested that recent elevated dies el fuel prices, if they persist,  would add about $12.9 billion in costs this year that will have to be absorbed by shippers or their customers.  Finally, higher natural gas prices have led to the shutdown of seve ral chemical plants in the Sixth District.  My conclusion from all this is that uncertainty is  certainly having some impact on the economy in our region, with activity a bit softer in some sect ors than I reported at the last meeting.  But clearly there are some sectors—housing and health  care to name a couple—that continue to do just fine. Sifting out the effects of uncertainty from f undamentals is no easier at the national level than at the District level.  Recent high-frequency data came in  a bit weaker than I had hoped, especially for labor markets and the auto sector.  But how much of this is due to uncertainty is not obvious to me.  At the same time, the source s of strength in the economy remain reasonably sound.  Consumer spending is being maintaine d, and housing continues at a high level.  However, increasing concerns are being expresse d about both.  Moreover, investment activity and inventory accumulation continue to lag.  I’m  not as optimistic as the Greenbook baseline forecast on the pickup in investment spending.  The prolonged investment slump scenario better captures my own view and would suggest a somewhat  slower growth forecast.  I really don’t see where the impetus to substantial new investment  will come from in the short run.  Despite the increased signs of weakness, I continue to believ e that substantial monetary stimulus remains in place.  That stimulus remains significant the longer  we hold rates below what market participants had initially expected.  Downward movement in l ong-term interest rates in dicates that our policy stimulus continues to filter through the term structure.  Further, should even parts of the 33 of 101Administration’s fiscal stimulus package be pa ssed, it would give us still additional positive impetus to growth. Having said all that, I believe we still face the same two ques tions we pondered last time.  First, how much of the slowdown is due to fundamentals, and how much is  due to uncertainty?  Second, would a further cut in ra tes have an impact on the funda mentals?  Sorting out these issues is important because I start from the pr emise that an easing of monetary policy can’t substantially affect uncer tainty or its sources.  Moreover, th e fundamental problems I see in the economy right now are more structural in nature, and those are not likely to be mitigated by further rate cuts. Also, I’m not as comfortable as I’d like to be with the way our models are capturing the evolution of the fundamentals and their impact  on the economy.  My sense from talking to business contacts is that in real ity the fundamentals may not be as strong as the model forecasts suggest.  Because of the way models are struct ured, they may not captu re the full structural dislocations that exist in the economy now and how they are bei ng resolved.  For example, our model may not fully incorporate the levels of debt held by both businesses and consumers and the implied fixed nominal payments associated wi th those commitments.  Further shocks that hinder cash flows could generate mo re dislocations and thereby slow  the progress to profitability.  In addition, I believe that uncerta inty is feeding back  into the economy, posing real costs that will have lagging consequences even after the uncertain ty is resolved.  This is especially true in several industries that were alr eady experiencing structural adjust ment processes.  For example, the current run-up in energy prices is certainly exacerbating an already difficult situation in the airline, trucking, and chemical indus tries.  I find it hard to believe  that even a quick resolution of 34 of 101the geopolitical uncertainties will enable many of these firms to bounce back as quickly as they might have done had they not been stressed by the ener gy situation.   To end where I began, it seems to me that th e extraordinary uncertainty we face today makes it very difficult to get a good reading on th e underlying fundamentals of the economy and the really important questions as to the mix of cyclical and struct ural issues we’re dealing with.  While it is probably fair to say that short-term, downside risks have increased somewhat, it’s not clear to me that this is the optimal time for another policy eas ing, though that may eventually be appropriate.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry.

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, economic expansi on in the West remained sluggish in the recent weeks.  District consumers reined in  spending in February and early March, making profitability a challenge for many retailers.  A number of District auto dealers also faced more difficult times as unit sales and profit margins fell .  Rising gasoline prices apparently constrained sales of SUVs, leaving several dealers with excess inventories.  One contact noted that manufacturers’ incentives are no longer enough to  entice borrowers.  Customers want dealer discounts as well. Like consumers, many firms also have h it the pause button, postponing investment and hiring decisions until the future looks clearer.  So me notable firms in the IT sector are actually scaling back.  Micron Technology of Boise, Applied Materials of Santa Clara, and Agilent of Palo Alto recently announced plans to lay off 10 pe rcent or more of their respective workforces.  A large San Francisco IT oriented  investment firm said it will  release up to 20 percent of its workforce over the next several months.  35 of 101State and local governments in  the West have been handi ng out pink slips as well.  Several thousand California teachers received layoff warnings in recent weeks, joining the ranks of park rangers, reserve fire fi ghters, and library staff.  Elsewh ere in the District, states are looking at salary cuts and program reductions  rather than layoffs to balance budgets.  California’s credit rating is now  tied with Louisiana’s for last  place after a round of downgrades by major rating agencies.  Alt hough these downgrades increased states’ borrowing costs, our estimates indicate that the increase will be sma ll relative to the size of the budget and the budget deficit.  While state budgets have constrai ned government spending in the West, federal increases for defense and homeland security expend itures have been a significant positive for the District.  The importance of defense dollars to the West can be seen at Boeing, where defense- related business has helped offset  declines in the commercial ai rcraft side.  Boeing now employs more people in the defense systems units than in commercial jets.   Turning to the national economy, recent data ha ve been negative on balance.  Given these data and intermeeting financial developments, we have lowered our expectations of growth this year, even after allowing for some further easing of monetary policy.  We now expect that real GDP will grow 3 percent this year versus 3½ percen t last time.  As a result, excess capacity rises further over the next few quarters, which puts do wnward pressure on core inflation.  The core PCE price index is now forecast to go up by just 1¼ percent in 2004.  Along with the weaker forecast we have heightened concerns about the potential downside.  The longer the economy remains partially paralyzed by high energy prices and uncertainty, the more  serious the downside risks.  Our forecast that the pace of output growth will pick up during this year depends on business fixed investment rebounding before cons umer spending falters.  Recent data on retail sales and auto sales have not been reassuring in this regard.  And there is as yet no convincing 36 of 101evidence that investment spending is ready to take up the slack.  Of course, the situation in Iraq is contributing to some extent to the recent deteriorati on in economic activity.  However, it’s not certain that a quick favorable outcome is immine nt or that such a resolution would provide an immediate boost to the economy that would remove the need for additional stimulus.  Some in the private sector have postponed hard-to-reverse investment and hiring decisions in the face of uncertainty.   As in the Greenbook, our most likely scenar io shows subpar growth and rising excess capacity for the next year.  Also, I agree with my  colleague, President Minehan, about the risks.  While the risks on both sides are si zable, the downside risks to bot h inflation and output are of much greater concern to me.  In my view a sign ificant easing of policy seems appropriate as a bit more insurance that we could take against these downside risks.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ec onomic activity in the Seventh District has softened.  Many of our contacts indicate that  they saw some signs of improvement beginning around the turn of the year and extending into the first half of February.  However, activity has deteriorated abruptly over the past few weeks.  Clearly, consumers and businesses have become increasingly cautious as international tensions have mounted.  But a number of our contacts doubt that the economy will grow robustly even afte r the situation in Iraq is resolved.  Their concerns seem to result from lackluster dema nd, excess capacity, and rising operating costs in the context of little or no pricing power.  But when we press them, they often have not been able to identify any root cause for th e weakness in demand other than th e international situation.  This is somewhat similar to Bill McDonough’s comments earlier. 37 of 101Housing is the only major sector in the District  that still seems to be robust.  Consumer spending has generally remained weak.  As we all know, light vehicle sales fell in February; early reports in March suggest li ttle improvement and, in the ca se of one of the Big Three, further weakening.  Automakers and dealers told  us that they were expecting some sales volatility from month to month, but  they clearly were surprised by how soft sales were in late portion of this decrease can be attributed to severe weather, which I’m happy to say did not find its way into the Seventh Federal Reserve District .  But many reported that they were seeing the influence of heightened uncertainty, weak labor  markets, and higher fuel costs on consumer demand.  Despite higher incentives, light vehicle inventories have risen above desired levels, and firms are being forced to cut production in order to keep their inventories in line. Outside of autos, District manufacturing has also slowed since our last meeting, with most businesses continuing to take a wait-and-se e attitude.  Contacts both inside and outside manufacturing have become incr easingly concerned about rising i nput costs.  Several of our directors in Chicago and Detroit reported that increasing prices for energy, property and casualty insurance, employee health care, and materials have boosted production costs significantly.  The combination of flat-to-declining demand, significa ntly higher costs, and fierce competition is pressuring profit margins.  In this environment, many businesses continue to delay hiring.  The phrase we keep hearing is “hiring paralysis.”  We’ve also heard reports that a number of large companies, in addition to the ones that Bob Pa rry just mentioned, are planning another round of layoffs.  Both Kelley and Manpower reported that their year-over-year grow th rates have trailed off significantly in recent months.  One firm did see a pickup in temporary hires in areas where military reservists were called up, but the effect was small. 38 of 101Turning to the national outlook, the macroeconomic picture is even more uncertain than it was at our last meeting.  Given the uncertainty  about Iraq in recent weeks, many businesses no doubt delayed major spending decisions.  Why no t wait another few weeks to see how events turn out?  It’s likely that such thinking contribut ed to the weak hiring we saw in February.  As I noted earlier, our contacts say that activity has slowed even more since the labor market reference week.  In addition, although oil prices have not yet reached extr emely disruptive levels, the prospect of further increases is an important downside risk to the economy.  As I mentioned earlier, many of our contacts say that demand is being held back by factors other than geopolitical risks, and this raises  the possibility that even if th e situation in Iraq is resolved quickly, we could be in for a pe riod of prolonged sluggishness.  Howe ver, at this point there is not much evidence that the weakness goes beyond Iraq.  Although our contacts are very concerned, they’ve offered few other specific rationales for the continuing sluggishness.  As David said, they’re having difficu lty disentangling the reasons fo r the weakness.  Moreover, the foundation appears in place for a pickup in gr owth—for example, accommodative monetary policy, lean inventories, and of course strong productivity growth. Accordingly, if the Iraq situation is resolved  quickly, we expect to  see activity accelerate later this year, although growth for the year will still fall short of pot ential.  Of course, as pointed out in the Greenbook simulations, which I thought were excellent, businesses and households could respond in a variety of ways as geopoliti cal events unfold.  So I guess it would be an understatement to say that the degree of near-term uncertainty surrounding the outlook is unusually high.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. 39 of 101

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  What we hear repeatedly around the District are phrases such as “muddling along,” “on hold,” and “wait and see.”  Bank loan demand is flat.  It’s very difficult to know—I don’t think a nybody can tell—how much of what we’ve been observing is a consequence of war fears and how  much of it reflects unde rlying uncertainties.  I’ve been pressing my contacts about their capital spending plans a nd in particular trying to find out if people are thinking ahead to  the expiration of the tax incentiv es in September of next year.  In general, people comment that they are not taki ng that into account yet, and capital spending is flat.  My UPS contact says that UPS capital  expenditures are for repairing or replacing equipment as necessary but there is no growth in the company’s capital  expenditures spending.  However, my FedEx contact said that FedEx does plan to buy trucks  very aggressively to take advantage of the investment incentives.  He exp ects that perhaps 5 to10 pe rcent of FedEx capital outlays in 2004 will reflect spending being moved from 2005 into 2004 to take advantage of those incentives. I believe there is a way to think about the national picture that ma y be useful.  Think back, for example, to the middle of last week  when the Greenbook was being put to bed, which was before the Thursday stock market rally.  Let me put this in a very overstated, extreme way in order to make a point.  If we view a lot of th e data as reflecting the means of a fairly wide distribution, then maybe there’s a 50 percent pr obability of a really good outcome—call that a 10—and a 50 percent probability of a very weak outcome, flat or something like that.  Call that weak outcome a zero.  The mean is 5, but in fact there’s not much probability weight on 5 as the actual outcome; it’s spread out at these extremes, and that is a ve ry unusual situation.  Now, what we’ve seen just in the last few days is a quite substantial surge in equity prices, a drop in the price of oil, and a big increase in the value of the dollar—a la rge one-day move yesterday that is 40 of 101very atypical.  Those developments may well in dicate that people are now putting more weight on the outcome we called 10 and less weight on th e outcome we called zero.  If this way of thinking about the situation is useful, it means —given that in coming weeks we will know more about whether the outcome is likely to be closer  to the 10 or the zero— that perhaps the best course for us at this point is  not to try to guess.  If we guess wrong, the action we took based on that guess will not have been very appropriate.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would describe the District economy as stable, and I do think that’s probably the right te rm.  There doesn’t seem to be any appreciable deterioration at this point, but at  the same time there’s little net growth.  Employment for the most part is flat, alt hough at the far western and eastern ends of the District we do have somewhat more favorable reports.  But those are relatively thinly populated areas, with relatively small economies.  If one talks to our directors and other business people a bout their hiring plans, fundamentally they don’t have any, which is to say that they’re not in tending to add to their employment levels anytime soon.  There is still a lot of optimism surrounding the housing sector, but I have the sense that in at  least some of the larger mark ets the builders now have gotten ahead of demand, and that will obviously have  implications for activity as time goes on.  Consumer spending ex-autos appears to be close to flat, and of course, auto sales have been softer recently as reflected in the national numbers. As far as the national economy is concer ned, I would make several maybe semi-random points.  First of all, the downward adjustment to the Greenbook forecast for real growth in the current and subsequent quarter look s right to me.  I think that’s c onsistent with the tenor of the incoming national data and is certa inly congruent with the anecdotes  that I’ve been picking up as 41 of 101well.  At the same time I don’t have the sense that the longer-term ou tlook in the Greenbook has changed any as we get to later th is year and into 2004.  I also th ink that’s appropriate.  I haven’t changed my longer-run view.  To be sure, there’ s a tremendous amount of uncertainty.  But those of us who’ve been at this for a while also know that there’s a great tendency toward getting whipsawed if one puts a lot of emphasis on the la st observation or two and not so much on the evidence regarding underlying fundamentals.  I think the fundamentals underpinning the longer-run outlook, which looks pretty favorable to me, are still in place.  I w on’t go through the entire litany, but I will point to the produc tivity numbers that some people have already cited and to the continued growth in di sposable income.   I do believe, and this is the view in the Greenbook as well, that employment is going to be slow to pick up.  We saw that following the 1990-91 recession.  But my reason for expecting that is not just historical precedent.  For busines ses there’s a lot of pressure on the top line and on the bottom line.  In that environment, adding to employment is just not a change that’s going to come very quickly.  Further, I do suspect that the near-term risks to the economy are probably on the downside.  That’s a suspicion, not really a convi ction.  But whether it’s right or not, I think we’re already positioned for that possibility.  Poli cy has reacted, and interest rates are clearly low.  I’m not sure that we’ll necessarily get a great deal of clarification regarding the outlook even if the conflict with Iraq goes very well.  I’ d like to think we would.  But there are a lot of other problems around the world, some of which could even be  exacerbated depending on how the situation in Iraq plays out.  Finally, in my view this is the time to avoid over-guessing and acting as if we know more than  we do.  There’s a tremendous am ount of uncertainty, and it’s probably going to pay to be patient and cautious and see how things unfold.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 42 of 101

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, growth in economic activity in the Third Distri ct has faltered.  At least part of this is due to uncertainty over the timing, duration, and magnitude of the war,  as many others have sa id.  It’s likely that when this uncertainty is resolved we’ll see stronger growth, but our survey evidence suggests that economic activity might not necessarily rebound quickly after military action in Iraq.  Manufacturing in our area has turn ed down over the last two months .  The general activity index of our business outlook survey fell from 2.3 in Febr uary to minus 8 in our March survey to be released on Thursday.  That is the lowest reading since December 2001.  New orders also A special question in our February su rvey provides some evidence on how soon economic activity might rebound after geopolitical uncer tainty is resolved.  We asked our survey respondents to tell us whet her their hiring and spending plans th is year were adversely affected by geopolitical uncertainty, weak demand, or so mething else.  Respondents could choose more than one factor.  About 40 percent of respondent s said that geopolitic al uncertainties were affecting their hiring and spending plans this year, but nearly 60 percent said  that lack of demand was having an effect.  Of course, the cause of the lack of demand may well be geopolitical risks.  It’s difficult to separate the two.  Nonetheless, th is seems to indicate concerns about the state of the economy that may go beyond the effects of the curr ent Gulf conflict.  Firms in our survey did not appear to be poised to resume spending upon the resolution of geopolitical uncertainty.  Only 10 percent plan to begin hiring and 8 percent plan to resume invest ment as soon as uncertainty is resolved.  But over 40 percent plan to wait at leas t six months or have no plans to increase hiring or capital spending upon resoluti on of uncertainty.  Responses to  the special question indicate that, relative to their plan s at the start of the year, about a th ird of the firms have delayed adding 43 of 101workers to their payroll.  Almost one-half of the firms have delayed increasing their capital spending.  These results are consistent with most forecasts, which expect growth to remain subdued until the second half of the year. Activity in other sectors of the regional economy has also eased since our last meeting.  Consumer spending has slowed; auto  sales and retail sales of ge neral merchandise declined in 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  No thanks! MR. SANTOMERO.  Nevertheless, our retailers tell us that, ev en before the storm, sales momentum was slowing.  Store traffic has been  down since January, and merchants generally indicate that consumers are limiting discretio nary purchases except for home-related goods.  Commercial and residential construction act ivity has eased, although demand for homes has continued strong.  Quoted rates for commercial space have been fairly stable in recent months, but effective rates have fallen.  In addition, to a ttract tenants, landlords are now willing to lease space for a shorter duration.  While the outlook of  those in the region’s business community remains positive, no one is expecting a strong reb ound.  This is similar to the view expressed by our business contacts at the last meeting.  However, my sense is that the tone has turned more negative.  Perhaps this reflects merely the proximity of military action; perhaps it reflects the realization that we haven’t seen much positive mome ntum and that certain sectors, in particular manufacturing, have deteriorated.   Similar to the District, the national economic recovery has been held back because of concerns about geopolitical uncertainty and most recently because of bad weather.  How large the effect is of these special factors is difficult to determine.  The data we’ve received since our 44 of 101last meeting have been on the weak side.  Ev en excluding the special f actors of the snowstorm and the call-up of reservists, the February em ployment report was much weaker than expected, with sizable and widespread job losses.  It is too soon to dete rmine whether the increase in capital spending orders we saw in January will  portend the beginning of a period of stronger economic growth.  Given the continued level of excess capacity, it would be hard to conclude that capital spending this year will be stronger than the moderate rate shown in the forecast.  There are indications that the gr owth of consumer spending is beginning to slow.  This might reflect the events involving Iraq, but it also might reflect concerns over job prospects. At this point, it might be useful for us to recognize again the difference between risk and uncertainty.  With risk, as we know, one can as sign probabilities to the list of outcomes and act appropriately given the distributi on.  With uncertainty, it is diffi cult to assign probabilities to outcomes.  Moreover, it is difficult even to de scribe all the possible outcomes themselves.  Generally firms and consumers have developed wa ys of handling risk.  Uncertainty is much harder to cope with.  It tends to paralyze deci sionmaking.  Today we are operating in a world of increased uncertainty.  The result has been the postponement of many economic decisions—and by extension the economic recovery.  A short-lived and successful war in Iraq will resolve some of the uncertainty—not all of it, though, sin ce winning the peace will be much tougher than winning the war and there are other problems, as  we have noted around this table today.  We won’t have much new data on the real side, given the lags in the data.  But we will have oil prices and financial markets as i ndicators to look at, as well as  anecdotal evidence we glean from our business contacts.  From these we should be  able to tell relati vely quickly whether a resolution of geopolitical uncertainty will result in new vitality for our real  economy or at least if it was the main drag delaying the recovery. 45 of 101Thus, my reading of the data suggests that the economic recovery has slowed somewhat since our last meeting.  But until there’s some reso lution of uncertainty, I believe there is little reason to expect that a change in our alrea dy accommodative policy stance would have much effect.  It might not even be noticed in the present circumstances.  Our future path should be clearer once some of the uncertainties surroundi ng the nature of military action in Iraq are resolved.  At that point, the Committee may wish  to act.  We need not wait until our next regularly scheduled meeting in May.  But at th is time, in my judgment, any action would be premature.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  For the last couple of meetings I’ve tempered my remarks about the New England econom y with references to a light at the end of the tunnel, however dim.  This had been seen in  confidence indicators, in  a leading index of the Massachusetts economy, and in many anecdotal refere nces.  I hesitate to say that the light has gone out, but the most significant change in New England between this meeting and the last one is that nobody talks about that light anymore.   The data suggest that recovery may be furthe r away than had been expected.  Many areas of the New England economy either weakened recently or are showing no signs of growth.  Month-to-month job losses accelerated in Decembe r, and benchmark revisions to employment data that will be released late r this month are likely to move em ployment totals down further.  Massachusetts has been losing jobs steadily whil e other states are resuming a downward trend.  Moreover, long-term unemployment is  an increasing problem.  A recen t analysis tells us that, in our region, the number unemployed for over six m onths was about five times greater in 2002 than in 2000; that number doubled for the nation as  a whole.  Consumer confidence tracked the 46 of 101move downward that was evident in the national data.  Business confidence, which had seen small increases in late 2002 and in January, dropped in February to levels last seen in late 2001.  Future conditions data dropped below 50, indicating that survey respondents no longer foresee positive conditions within six months.  Similarly, an index of leading indicators prepared by University of Massachusetts economists—which had been predicting some growth by midyear—turned negative, suggesting that the Massachus etts economy will shrink about 1 percent rather than grow.  Finally, confidence among New Engl and technology executives plummeted in the last quarter of 2002, as reported by a local survey.  These exec utives had experienced some growth in their businesses early  in the year, but prospects d immed by year-end, particularly in the telecommunications and software sectors.  Commercial real estate markets apparently softened even further around the turn of the year.  Office vacancies rose both in downtown Boston and in the suburbs, but we’re told that reported vacancy data apparently do not even come close to capturing the extent of available space.  Observers say that, even in the slowdown of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Boston mark et did not experience tw o years back-to-back of negative absorption.  Contacts now predict that 2003 will be the third consecutive year that has occurred. We spent some time trying to sort out what is perhaps the unsortable—whether geopolitical uncertainty or underl ying economic fundamentals are the cause of the ever softer patch in New England’s economic activity.  Not surpri singly, this is really hard to determine.  Our Beige Book, advisory council, and other contact s note that geopolitical uncertainty is clearly having some effect but that it’s hard to quan tify.  The one channel that seemed most clearly affected was consumer behavior.  But most contacts also argued that, while the military situation in Iraq and other geopolitical con cerns were an issue at the margin, the economy would not be 47 of 101showing solid growth even in the absence of war.  Other factors, such as excess capacity in a variety of industries and a murky picture for the high-tech sector, have contributed strongly to economic weakness.  Furthermore, while one would expect that war-related spending in military intensive New England might have a positive effect , no significant effect has yet been reported.  The comment was made that, if your business was not involved in the mobilization effort, the effect of military spending was actually negative in that steps were being taken to offset mobilization costs wherever possible. Finally, I can’t leave the subject of New England without so me mention of the deepening state fiscal crises, especially in Massachusetts and Maine.  The drop in employment and a bleak outlook for many businesses suggest that cuts no w projected by the states to achieve fiscal balance may not be sufficient and that their e ffects may reverberate on the regional economy.  Indeed, a month ago we thought Massachusetts ta x revenue was likely to grow at just under 3 percent in fiscal 2004, which matched the projec tions of the new state administration.  It now appears that a scenario of no re venue increase has a greater prob ability.  One area of the state’s economy that so far has not experienced much of a downturn is the heal th care sector, which accounts for 10 to 15 percent of the local economy.  That could change.  Further cuts in state funding for Medicaid and the related loss of fede ral matching funds would eliminate the positive negative territory.  Obviously, this will come b ack to haunt in the form of higher medical insurance costs already noted as a serious conc ern by regional businesses, large and small.   On the national scene, incoming data most recently have been disappointing.  Labor 48 of 101company that is involved in pr oviding audio equipment for high- end cars.  Throughout most of the 2002 period he has seen resilience in his forecast three and six months out.  Obviously, he has to get forecasts directly from the automakers.  In February that resilience came to an end, and the forecast looking forward dropped significantly.  His experience over thirty years or so in the industry suggests that this is a unique break with the past, and it portends quite a bit of softness going forward in projections of auto sales.  Of c ourse, it’s hard to separate the effects of the mobilization of reservists and the blizzard that  occurred in the New England area, and all down the East Coast as well, on the critical Presid ents’ Day weekend.  But overall, the data are not particularly encouraging in my view.  Of course  the real question facing us now is not what is happening currently, because it’s ha rd to sort that out, but what is likely to happen over the rest of the year.  In some ways that is  even harder to disentangle.   I have to say, as I said earlier, that I th ink the baseline forecast in the Greenbook is about as optimistic a case as can be made.  In that fo recast the war is short and relatively cheap.  Uncertainty about geopolitical events drops markedly, taking with it much of the economic restraint we’re currently experi encing.  Consumer spending and residential investment rebound solidly.  Oil prices drop rapidly through the year .  Productivity is well main tained.  Key parts of the Administration’s tax package ar e passed.  Interest rates remain  low.  Equity markets show steady positive improvement; and by year-end, busin ess profits and investment spending are on track for double-digit growth in 2004.  Frankly, I thi nk the risks to this for ecast have to lie on the downside. The degree to which both business spending an d consumer spending rebound in the last half of this year is debatable, and I think it’s debatable not just because of  oil prices.  I do wonder about the effect of developments in Venezuela a nd Nigeria and about the excess capacity or lack 49 of 101thereof in Saudi Arabia and other places around the Gulf.  I wonder whet her oil prices will drop as fast as they do in the forecast and stay low.  Is that expectation realiz able?  With regard to auto sales, the projections in the Greenbook seem  particularly robust, going from the current pace of 15½ million to 16 million to  17 million plus in the second half of the year.  Moreover, it’s by no means clear that the Administration’s tax plan will be passed in a ny form.  Finally, the strength of housing in the forecast is remarkable  as well.  The projection of 2 million starts by early 2004 suggests a housing boom comparable to that in the early to mid-1980s, when arguably the demographics were quite different.   Lots of things have to go really well in a very short time for the Greenbook forecast to be realized.  Indeed, it’s more optimistic about  both growth and infla tion—particularly by 2004— than most other forecasts, including our own in Boston, for whatever that’s worth.  Clearly the Greenbook staff, outside forecaste rs, and we in Boston face a greater-than-normal degree of uncertainty.  But I’m uncomfortable with a baseli ne that seems to resolv e most questions on the optimistic side.  Even if we were to take the Greenbook forecast as the most likely outcome, where does that leave us as we move from 2003 to  2004?  The Greenbook is explicit about this.  Excess capacity persists with the unemploym ent rate at 5½ percent and output about ¾ percentage point below potentia l.  The only alternative scenar io that changes that picture involves a 50 basis point  reduction in rates. What should we do about this?  High levels of  uncertainty clearly ca ll for caution.  It is arguable that an easing in policy right now won’t affect business i nvestment and that the decline in ten-year Treasury yields, if sustained for any time, should act to keep the residential and mortgage refinancing markets al ive.  However, given the unce rtainty—and I would argue the longer-term undesirability—of add itional fiscal policy stimulus, monetary policy is the only tool 50 of 101left to support an economy that may face funda mental problems.  The conservative, prudent central banker in me agrees with Vice Chair McDonough that, given current levels of uncertainty and the imminent war, the right thing to do may be to say little, stay pu t, and keep our powder dry.  But I am concerned about how long it really will be prudent to continue in this posture.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ m not sure I can follow that gloomy assessment and alleviate it very much.  Like othe rs around the table, I’ve focused on our struggle to sort out the restraining near -term effects of the war concerns from the more fundamental factors affecting of the economy.  Unfortunately , the picture became even murkier over the intermeeting period.  I do think we need to remember that the January data on consumption and especially on investment raised hopes that the anticipated strengthe ning in demand was under way before the economy seemed to hit a wall in February.  We are dealing with what is fortunately a most unusual, extraordinary situ ation—with the country on the brink of a long-anticipated war.  What is also unusual is that  this war could be deflationary rather than inflationary as the vast majority of the wars th rough history have been.  That’s because the usual pressures on resources from fighting the war could be outweighed by the negative effects on private demand of a disruption to oil supplies and of heightened uncertainty.  But it may well be that the maximum deflationary impact is occurri ng in the lead-up to the war rather than the war itself.  It’s in the anticipation stage that uncerta inty is greatest and that  markets price in some odds on major oil field disruptions.  Surely, these sorts of considerations along with some very nasty weather, at least along the East Coast—it ’s always nasty in Chicago.  [Laughter]  

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I don’t think I’m going to mention the weather again! 51 of 101

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. You folks in Chicago wouldn’t ev en have noticed it if you had had this storm!  Seasonally adjusted, it’s always spring in Chicago.  Very nasty weather along the East Coast had a major effect on the data for employme nt, production, and sales in February.  The rise in energy prices since late last year, refl ected in gasoline and home heating expenses, undoubtedly sapped consumer spending directly.  Moreover, the higher gasoline prices and uncertainty about future gasoline prices may ha ve played a role in weakening auto sales, especially if that uncertainty cause d people to postpone decisions.   Governor Bernanke noted at th e last meeting that, the closer the event with uncertain outcomes, the higher the hurdle rate for investment .  It’s not surprising that many different kinds of business commitments—hiring as well as sp ending on capital goods—were pushed back.  It strikes me that today’s housi ng data may suggest that decisi ons on home purchases and housing investment could be affected as well by the height ened uncertainty.  Certai nly this uncertainty is reflected in equity markets, where the equity premium—a key element in what is in effect a hurdle rate for buying the existing capital stock—has risen sharply.  Undoubtedly as uncertainties abate, the markets will improve—as we’ve already seen in the last few days—and this improvement will allow stronger fundamentals to show through.   Nonetheless, we don’t know how strong the fundamentals are.  We can’t completely dismiss the possibility that the February data were also signaling a le ss robust strengthening in demand than we had anticipated.  That’s certainl y the way the credit markets seemed to interpret the new information, especially the February em ployment report.  Interest rates were marked down across the yield curve, with declines in forward rates in the five-to-seven-year range accounting for the largest decreases .  A portion of the earlier drop in equity prices seemed to 52 of 101reflect not only higher equity premiums but downward revisions to earnings and revenue forecasts, which were probably only tange ntially related to war fears.   At this point, however, it is simply not possible to sort out the relative strength of the various influences on the economy or financial markets.  The staff based its forecast on the current structure of prices and rates and fina ncial markets because it was the only sensible default mode.  The lower equity prices, in partic ular, played a role in weakening the forecast a touch.  But those prices and rates, as Dave point ed out, reflect the means of some very skewed and strangely dispersed distributions.  All we know for sure is th at, as the situation unfolds and various outcomes get more or less probability weight, those prices and rates will change—and possibly by quite a lot as we’ve seen in the last few days.  Moreover, a good part of that unfolding will occur relatively soon, and a reason able presumption is that the forecast will change too, perhaps significantly.   Personally, I suspect that our next action is more  likely to be an easing than a tightening.  I base that on the possibility that at least a lit tle of the February weakness reflected continued underlying softness and broader business uncertainty and on the possibility that geopolitical risk could continue to weigh on oil prices, sentiment, and spending for a while.  I combine these possibilities, however sma ll, with the notion that at this stage of the economic cycle—with a sizable output gap and low and declining inflatio n—the consequences from inadvertently having policy a little too tight would be far more adverse than the cons equences from having it a little too easy.  But I don’t have any real conviction about the next policy action.  We’ll have more information about unfolding events and their potentia l effects soon.  Over the near term, much of that information will come from  reactions in financial and oil markets, as underlying trends in spending will only slowly reveal themselves.  Th ese markets will be noisy.  Undoubtedly they’ll 53 of 101overreact, driven by hopes and fear s as much as by a clear-eyed re ading of the course of the economy, so extracting the important signals could be difficult.  Bu t given my lack of conviction about the future and my sense that market signals will be important and over time helpful, I think the Federal Reserve should not be trying to steer  markets at this point.  Like many others who have already commented, I think it’s time to ad mit our ignorance, get out of the way, and let events and their reactions unf old.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. MR. MCTEER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Not mu ch new and significant is going on in the Eleventh District economy.  Personal income  is growing but not fa st enough to raise living standards.  Employment finally is growing again but at rates so anemic that it feels like contraction.  Other indicators have crossed th e threshold into expansion but not by much.  I would like to be able to conclude  that the data signify the end of the downturn in our region and might even be the start of a recovery, but I’m not convinced.  Last Friday and Saturday I met with the fine people from the Louisiana Bankers A ssociation, and just before that I met with our board of directors and our Advisory Council on Small Business and Agriculture.  The views expressed in the latter two groups were considerably more negative than the last time they met.  The mood of both meetings can be summarized by the opening remarks of one of my directors, to wit: “With recoveries like th is, who needs recessions!”   Single-family housing has been holding up, partic ularly at the lower and moderate price points.  One director felt  that mortgage rates could rise by a percentage point or so, maybe even 2 points, from the current very low levels w ithout having a strongly negative effect on housing 54 of 101demand.  In her words, “Mortgage rates provid e the nicotine to the housing industry, but job growth is the real source of nutrition.”  Her point was that without some improvement in job growth, the effect of lo wer interest rates likely will wear off.   On the high-tech side, our director from a major semiconductor manufacturer indicated that the order-to-shipment ratio in the chip indust ry had finally risen above 1 for the first time in two years.  Recovery has now hit every sector of the industry excep t wired telecom; but of all the sidelines until they can get a better handle on market demand.  In the meantime, prices are under extreme downward pressure.  She’s looking for single- digit growth in the next  year or two.  With no increase in capital spending and therefore no pickup in supply, she hopes that some increased pricing power will be restored in late 2004. We had several reports from directors who were quite knowledgeable about the energy business.  There was some discussion about how much of a war premium is built into current oil prices.  The uncertainty on the pr emium involves questions in at least two areas.  First, is there really surplus capacity in the Middle East?  It has neve r been tested.  Second, how much infrastructure damage will be done in Iraq?  One director noted that  oil infrastructure is fairly hard to destroy.  The big question raised by a coup le of directors was Venezuela, a country that was characterized as being on the brink of disint egrating into civil war or anarchy.  Venezuelan oil has a big impact on U.S. gasoline prices.  The government has fired half the oil company’s middle management and replaced them with croni es and military people reported to be not too competent when it comes to the basic logistics of moving oil to market.  Significant gasoline shortages already exist within Ven ezuela, and it’s likely that oil pr oduction is running at less than half the claimed rate.  Both the country and its oil production could be  on the verge of total 55 of 101breakdown.  Around Houston the talk is beginning to  be about a return to $30 a barrel for oil after Iraq is settled rather than  the $24 price that had been anti cipated a couple of months ago.   Concerns were also expressed about natural gas.   If prices were to remain in the area of $6 it would suggest that we have a shortage bordering on scarcity.  If businesses come to believe that gas prices will remain at those elevated leve ls, they will shut their plants and sell the gas they’ve contracted for.  Our petrochemical plants are aging facilities that were built on the basis of $.50 gas not $5 plus gas.  Th ese plants could shut down, and their output could go overseas.   The tone of our small business council wa s similarly downbeat.  I got the distinct impression that many of these bus iness people and their peers are just barely hanging in there. Also, there seems to be a lot of disguised unemployment and underemployment.  Two of the small business representatives on our council indicat ed that current conditions are the worst they have ever seen, and both of them have been in business in the Dallas area for over thirty years.  When we pressed them on whether things were r eally worse than during the Texas depression in the late 1980s they both without hesitation said “yes.”  They li ved through those tough times, yet they feel that today’s fundamentals are worse.  I hope this view is a function of hazy memory.  I’ve seen that before when the economy is going through the destruc tion phase of creative destruction and when it’s too s oon to discern th e creative part. Turning to the national economy, I must say that, given the ec onomic and non-economic uncertainties we face, the staff baseline forecas t seems plausible in its broad contours.  I especially appreciated the choice of alternative simulations.  I count myself to be among those who believe that the disinflation fo rces of the last decade will con tinue to prevail over the forces acting to push up the rate  of inflation.  As a result, I found myself drawn toward the Greenbook simulations involving a lower funds  rate or the adoption of a market-based funds rate.  While 56 of 101being drawn in that direction, I’m not ready to su pport a reduction in the fed funds rate at this meeting.  Given all the fog and the dust out ther e and the sand being stirred up by the threat of war, the public and the markets would have di fficulty interpreting any change in our policy stance at this time.  While I believe that the downside risks prevail, this is probably not a good time to try to do anything about it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  After starting the year off strongly, the economy seems to have taken another stumble in  February.  The list of disappointing economic reports since our last meeting is long:  the jobs report, consumer confidence, retail sales, auto production, industrial production, earnings foreca sts, state and local budgets, and now housing starts.  The Greenbook authors have taken ½ point off the growth forecast for both the first and second halves of the year.  Blue Chip forecasts  also have been lowered.  Foreign growth has been written down.  Of course, the uncertainty about  the military situation is or could be at the root of all of this.  Forecasts these days seem  to hinge on a few criti cal exogenous assumptions, with everything else being endogenous.  In toda y’s situation, for example, I can imagine two vastly different scenarios all starting fr om one or two changed assumptions.   One I’ll call the “green” scen ario after the Greenbook and Greenspan.  [Laughter]  I’m going to replay Cathy’s comments a bit here but a little muted.  Lifting away the military uncertainty, the Greenbook base cas e is actually rather optimistic .  Oil prices are high now but drop down in that forecast in line with futures market s.  The stock market is at least in neutral.  Fiscal policy is very expansiona ry.  Consumption is reasonably strong with saving rates staying low to normal.  High-tech investment is already sl ated to grow in the first half of the year, and the rest of investment soon follows.  The output  gap rises for a while and then starts dropping 57 of 101pretty sharply.  If one splices onto this a mo re ebullient stock market, which we may already have seen some of, it’s easy to imagine a fa irly bullish scenario—one in which further policy action is probably not required a nd, indeed, may even have to be  reversed at some point.   At the same time, I can change one or two assumptions and get an altogether different scenario.  Oil prices in fact don’t come down, perh aps because of the damage to the oil wells in Iraq combined with Venezuela not returning to full production and the ap parently low level of inventories.  Natural gas prices  stay high and keep electricity prices high.  For whatever reason, the stock market stumbles yet again, and wealth values don’t recover.  Saving rates rise more than forecast, and the lessened accelerator effect li mits the growth of investment in the context of continuing capital overhang.  Budget deficits soar , and fiscal expansion is limited.  The dollar falls and hurts the economies of Europe, Latin  America, and Japan without doing ours much good.  Monetary policy makers in these other countries are hamstrung either by real constraints or imagined constraints.  The differences between these two scenario s are not all that large—hinging on a few exogenous assumptions about oil prices, stock prices , and confidence in gene ral.  At this point we really can’t forecast these critical magnitudes very well, and it makes sense to sit on the sidelines for a while.  It is quite possible that th e critical magnitudes will become much clearer in a short time and we will be in a better position to act.  But as Da ve Stockton suggested, it’s also quite possible that the critical magnitudes will no t clear up very rapidly and we will have to go back to making policy under extreme uncertainty.  The best approach then may not be to wait until all significant uncertainties have clarifie d, but I leave those puzzles until another day.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto. 58 of 101

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in the Fourth District appear to be broadly cons istent with those in the rest of  the nation.  Two sentences in the Beige Book national summary descri be our situation very well—name ly that growth in economic activity remained subdued in January and Fe bruary and that geopol itical and economic uncertainties are constraining business and consumer spending and tempering near-term expectations.  I think the staff did an excellent job in reporting, analyzing,  and synthesizing the data that have come in since our last meeting.  The staff concluded that the economy is likely to be weaker in the near term, yet real GDP growth and inflation next  year are expected to be about the same as was forecast at our last meeting, indicating the largely tr ansient nature of the additional softness.  I generally agree with that forecast, although how I arri ve at the GDP figures is slightly different.  I’d like to focus my comments this morni ng on some of this near-term weakness and its potential implications.  First, th e March 7 release of the February labor market data does seem to have powerfully affected market  sentiment about the economy.  All of us are aware that last month’s weather distorted economic activity, and our Beige Book contacts  across a wide range of retail sectors reported that th e winter storms did affect their sales.  Even if we knew how to account for the weather, we probably still woul d conclude that labor markets weakened in with one month’s data.   One of my directors, whose firm supplie s materials nationally to the homebuilding orders had declined in February, they bounced back in early March.  Ov erall I don’t get a sense from our directors or advisory council members a nd other contacts in the Di strict that conditions 59 of 101have changed fundamentally in the past few mont hs.  But, like President Santomero, I detect a significantly more negative tone in their comments.  The economy is still expanding, and it is expect ed to do so, albeit at a very moderate pace.  Housing has continued to be strong, and the bankers in my District say that it’s going to continue to be strong.  Business investment is weak, and it is e xpected to remain weak according to business people in my District.  I’ve had many conversations with contacts throughout the District about how credit availability, the geopoli tical risks, and capacity utilization are affecting the pace of their capital spending.  Bankers report that they are very liqui d and anxious to lend.  In fact, they note in a more short-term perspec tive that they finally ha ve started to receive inquiries from their business customers.  Customer s have increased their cr edit lines but are not using those lines, which tells me at least that th ey’re gearing up for some use of them down the road but not until the Iraq situation is resolved.  Within the last week alone, two of my business contacts informed me that their firms had turned away sizable orders because to fill those orders they would have to add to capacity  and, with the uncertainty that we face, they weren’t willing to do that.  In ordinary times, those investments would have been made. So, as I commented at the last meeting, I still am concerned a bout the outlook for a snapback in BFI given the curren t low levels of capacity utili zation.  Our research department did some statistical work to examine the rela tionship between capacity utilization and business fixed investment.  We found that both the level and the change in capaci ty utilization strongly lead business investment, again suggesting that we shouldn’t expect a pickup in BFI until some of the excess capacity gets absorb ed.  From our Beige Book contacts  we hear a consistent story, namely that they are not willing to add to their ca pacity.  Many of them still have a lot of idle capacity and aren’t planning any additional capital sp ending even to bring that  idle capacity back 60 of 101on line.  This does not mean that we won’t see any spending on plant and equipment or software but rather that the upward trajector y is not going to be as steep as we’d like to see.  Interestingly, I think the caution about capital spending f its into the Greenbook projection of strong productivity growth.  I say that because the CEOs I talk to are telling me  that, even though they are paying very close attention to payrolls and to capital sp ending—they’re not hiring and they’re not spending—they are still innovating.  Th ese efforts show up in the healthy rate of multifactor productivity growth as we see in the Greenbook. In summary, I am discouraged by the lack of  progress in the expansion thus far, but I believe that some of it is clearl y due to the unsettled risks of wa r and terrorism.  Obviously, the potential for war is a very dark cloud overh ead—and not that far overhead perhaps.  Although this cloud is restraining economic activity now, I do believe that its successful dissolution will result in a continued economic e xpansion.  So as the Vice Chair and others have indicated today, this is a time for the central bank to be patient,  to watch developments unfold, and especially to see how the economy looks once this dark cloud  of uncertainty diss ipates.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Si nce the last meeting we have witnessed a striking example of the differences between ri sk and uncertainty, with the latter being an important factor in the private sector’s econom ic decisionmaking.  The economy appeared to have picked up its pace of growth in January a nd then suffered a setback by flattening a bit in in a slowing of consumer purchases of big- ticket items.  Businesses mirrored consumers by slowing their orders of new equipment, cu tting production, and dela ying hiring.  Finally, 61 of 101financial market participants appear to be hi ghly uncertain about future  stock returns and are highly averse to that uncertainty.  These factors evidenced themselves in a decline in stock prices that drove the equity risk premiu m to the highest level in more th an a decade while, at the same time, purchases of corporate bonds drove yield spreads on those assets down further.  These financial market developments are most unusual in  my eyes in that they  reflect a fundamental tension and inconsistency in risk appetites across assets pools that look to the same source of earnings—corporate earnings—for the underlying cash flow to support asset valuations. Now, as we all know, this uncertainty broke a bit last week and a little more with the President’s speech yesterday.  What we’ve seen then is that stock prices soared, the dollar rallied, government bond prices fell, and oil and gold prices slid.  As a central bank, presumably we should put a great deal of weight  on financial market and commodity  market input.  But in this case one can only hope that the optimism about a benign outcome to both the war and the peace that’s embodied in these changes in asset prices becomes a reality.   When put in an international context, as Dino pointed out earlier this morning, it is clear that financial market participants still seem to see the U.S. economy as—if I can say it this way—one of the least ugly economies on the hori zon.  Perhaps they’re looking to our longer-term fundamentals, which I would say are basically sound.  Fiscal  policy is already accommodative, monetary policy is by many measures still supportive of growth, the dollar has weakened a bit on net, and productivity continues to increase.  Because of the uncertainty we have witnessed, it is difficult if not impossible to  get a firm view of the forces driving recent economic developments.  It is true that we we re shocked not just by geopolitical concerns, which mounted steadily, but also by severe weather,  which played through to higher gasoline and heating oil prices.  However, some of the weakness may also reflect more fundamental 62 of 101difficulties that the economy is having in reco vering from the recession.  The Greenbook reflects the forecaster’s dilemma by presenting what is described as a “mean” forecast, thereby I think putting equal weight on a range of possible outcomes.  I do not see this as a cop-out at all but rather an honest reflection of the fact that nobod y can declare with certainty which forces, either transitory or more fundamental , will shape the intermediate te rm.  As others have already indicated, in these circumstances a prudent centra l bank certainty wants to do no harm.  That is best accomplished, I believe, by reflecting honestly the imponderables that the immediate future holds and also by waiting for greater  clarity to return.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  In talking with bankers within  the last week or so, I think the vantage points of two in particular were of interest.  One indicated that at his bank, one of the largest consumer lenders in the country, the volume and credit quality they have been experiencing recently is consistent with upward pressures on prices and yet they don’t sense any pricing pressures.  The fact that they are a major cred it card issuer and have a significant range of consumer loan products has histor ically given them a window through which they have been able to predict retail sales quite well, and that was the vantage point he was talking about.  In contrast, on the commercial loan side he had two observations.  One is that there is nothing in the pipeline.  But two, which is of considerable interest, is that the credit quality of their loan portfolio has improved.  If you follow the Call Report data, yo u would know that credit quality even on commercial portfolios had been declining up through the end of last year; but in this banker’s judgment, it has leveled out and maybe even improved.  So we see the contrasting effects of banks having experienced improved credit qua lity yet no loan demand, which may in fact 63 of 101corroborate Governor Bernanke’s th esis that the closer we get to the event, the higher the hurdle rate.  The second report is from a bank that is a major commercial lender and also a major securities servicer.  That bank had exactly the same experience with respect to the commercial loan portfolio but also had what it described as paralysis with resp ect to equ ity activity—no cross-border activity and no IPOs.  The underwr itings tend to be coming primarily from the municipal sector.  The description we’ve heard this  morning is of an atmosphere of uncertainty, some portion of which is geopolitical. This bank er would characterize it somewhat differently.  He would describe it as paralysis of which th e dominant reason is ge opolitical risk, recognizing that there may well be other risks also.         One other note of caution from my contact s is that banks are now recognizing and starting to feel how expensive liquidity can be.  As a result,  we’re seeing evidence of banks reaching for yield.  There has been a firming of the secondary market for commercial loans, for example, and new interest in the B tranche of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs).  We also see banks reaching out on the term of their lo ans and investments to achieve higher rates of return, something Dino suggested wa s occurring and that I think Pres ident Pianalto hinted at as well.  All in all, it is certainly  a time of great uncertainty and therefore, as President Guynn and others have said, perhaps not a circumstance that can most directly be addressed through monetary policy. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.   Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  I also wanted to talk a little about the financial sect or, including banks, and contrast that with what we see happening in the real sector.  The Bluebook pointed out that commercial banks in the United States had r ecord earnings in 2002.  And they had record 64 of 101earnings in 2001.  We had back-to-back years of record earnings in  the commercial banking system during a recession period an d a relatively slow recovery—a period when interest rates have hit forty-year lows and one characterized  by unusual liquidity circ umstances as funds came back into the banking system.  I think one of the things we’re fi nding is that, while it is difficult to operate in an environment of uncertainty, banks really have learned to manage risks well.  The asset–liability management processes that bank s initiated in the 1980s and fine-tuned in the 1990s clearly show that they can go through a major interest rate cycle and as a whole improve their earnings.  Net interest margins in  fact actually wide ned last year.   On the credit side, we also saw banks managi ng credit very well.  If we look at the 2002 numbers, the loan-loss provision as a percentage of the return  on assets was basically flat compared with the previous year.  So again, banks are doing a much better job at managing credit risks.   What is also remarkable about  these bank earnings is th at they were achieved through a record return on assets.  It wasn’t done through financial leverage.  Banks in fact deleveraged last year, so it wasn ’t a record year for return on equity.  Banks achieved record earnings through stronger fundamentals as well as better risk management.   If we look at the broader financial markets, es pecially since our last meeting, we see that some of the volatility and excessive credit spread s we’ve observed in the last year or so have continued to improve.  As was mentioned earlier, while debt spreads are wider than historically, the spreads have moved in.  Much like what we ’re hearing from bank credit officers, the credit removed.  What upset everybody at the end of 2001 and 2002 was that prime credits were going immediately to bankruptcy and that was happening because of what I love to call “operational risks.”  Credit was not the real issue.  These ba nkruptcies were due to accounting scandals and 65 of 101management fraud.  Companies th at deteriorated over time, lik e K-Mart, were handled in the traditional way.  But it was the uncertainty about what was going on with regard to these other factors that contributed to the widening of debt spreads in the investment-grade market.  That seems to be coming down now, since we haven’t had any material events of th at type in the last several months. Companies are restructuring.  We know th ey’ve lengthened from commercial paper to longer-term debt.  Their corpor ate cash flow has also been improving, unfortunately in part because they are not making capital investments.  Consumers continue to refinance and restructure their debt.  The staff has shown us th at household debt service is actually down from where it was a couple of years ago.  So household finances are in good shape.  If the banking sector, corporate balance sheets,  household finances, and debt markets are stronger—and equity “disconnect” between the improvement of the fi nancial sector and the weakness in the real sector.  After our FOMC meeting in January I was optim istic, as the news continued to be very, very strong.  Then as the February data cam e out, as many of you have remarked already, suddenly we began to question wh at was happening.  Was it the snow storms?  After all, even an old Southerner like myself actually had to go ou t and buy a pair of boots!  I thought that would have helped the retail sales in February, but it didn’t!  High heating oil an d natural gas costs also took a toll on people’s spending.  But as we’ve talk ed about, the uncertain ty regarding what is going on in Iraq and maybe other countries appears to be preying both on consumers and businesses.  Because it is very hard to evaluate risks and to ma ke decisions in a period of high uncertainty, the decisionmaking that affects real  economic activity and cr eates jobs and growth 66 of 101in our resources has slowed to almost a halt.  So  until we really know more about the situation in Iraq, I’m not sure what we can do to deal with  the uncertainty through monetary policy.  The concerns involve not only the war but als o, as many of you have mentioned already, the aftermath of the war.  Unlike the situation in Kuwait, we are not going to be reinstalling the government; we have to help create a successor g overnment.  Therefore, I think the uncertainty is going to continue for some time.  Because of the nature of the uncertainty, I’m uncomfortable making any change right now in th e direction of policy.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bernanke. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As  many have noted, we ’re currently in a period of maximum uncertainty, with the resu lt that the economy is almost in a state of suspended animation.  Until the world situation clar ifies, the hurdle rate for investment or any major commitment will be very high, as some of my colleagues have noted.  By the same token, any action we would take on rates to day would be largely inframarginal. I continue to believe that the economy ha s substantial fundamental and financial strengths.  There is also a lot of accumulated sl ack in the economy because we’ve had essentially no employment gains for about two years.  Therefore, I think there’ s a good chance that a reasonably successful resolution of the Iraqi situ ation will lead to str ong growth in the second half of this year and in 2004.  But in deference to Presid ent Minehan, I also agree that some alternative, more negative scenar ios are possible.  Here are two. The first is what I call the “fear of fear itself” scenario—continuing pessimism.  There might be a less than satisfactory outcome to the war or continuing fear of terrorism, in which case consumer confidence and self-confirming doubts might lead to slow growth in investment and consumer spending.  I think th at’s a real possibility  and one that we need to keep in mind.  67 of 101A second possibility, which is perhaps comple mentary to that, would be a weak profits scenario.  Firms could find that  their international markets ar e very weak, and they could continue to suffer from high energy costs and hi gh costs for insurance and pensions.  That combined with structural issues in a number  of major industries a nd perhaps a lack of technological opportunities—or opportunities that are less good than hoped for—might result in profits that are not strong.  That  in turn would lead to weaker stock market valuations and less investment than we’re hoping for.  So those ar e two possible scenarios.  Given the amount of slack in the economy, I think either  of those situations, if they were to materialize, would be amenable to continued stimulation fr om both monetary and fiscal policy. Let me say a word about timing.  Over the intermeeting period ther e is, of course, the possibility that the current very high level of uncertainty  will be resolved one way or the other.  On the one hand, we could get very good results in  Iraq with strong financial market reactions, a boost in consumer confidence, strong anecdotal reports, and so on.  That would support the case for waiting and watching with the hope that the strong recovery would commence.  On the other hand, we might get the other tail of the distribu tion of possible outcomes—bad results in Iraq and much concern at home, and negative financial mark et responses to that.  But I want to echo what David Stockton and several others have pointed out—namely that th ere is a large middle area of the distribution that we might be  facing at the next meeting.  There may still be considerable uncertainty about the state of th e economy going forward and whether or not the scenario in the Greenbook will in fact be realized.  I would like to caution against the situation where we are continually waiting for uncertainty to be resolved  before taking action.  That situation could go on indefinitely.  If the economy is still struggling and if there is no significant improvement or 68 of 101evidence of increasing strength by our next meeti ng, I hope we will at least consider the case for easing policy at that time.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very much.  Mr. Reinhart.   

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.2  Mr. Chairman, Carol will be distributing some materials that I’ll be referring to.  With events movi ng quickly, I thought it best to start with the snapshot in exhibit 1 of  market participants’ current  thinking about the decision you will announce this afternoon.  As shown in  the top panel, at ten o’clock this morning the April federal funds rate future s contract traded 9 basis points below the current 1¼ percent intended level, consistent with a one-in-three chance of a quarter-point easing.  Survey responses co llected Friday (the middle left panel) indicate that the majority of investors believe that you will de pict the balance of risks as tilted toward economic weakness, a shift in sentiment (the middle right panel) that followed the release of a surp rising contraction in payroll employment.  You might not want to bank too much on these readings, though, in that expectations have been changeable of la te and are now quite diffuse, as shown in the bottom panel in the implied probability distribution of where the funds rate will be in six months.  Note both that the left  tail of this probabi lity distribution is bunched at quite low levels of the funds ra te and that one-fifth  of the mass rests above the current intended rate.  Among the market participants who are counting on policy easing, recent readings on the labor market—both the Fe bruary employment report and the high level of initial claims—seem to weigh im portantly in their thinking.  Moreover, with equity wealth once ag ain lower and consumers appe aring less confident, the expansion of aggregate demand seems to  be on a slower track than we had anticipated earlier.  The dec lines in estimates of the e quilibrium real federal funds rate, plotted in your next exhibit, su mmarize that downward reassessment of spending relative to potential output.  Ind eed, by these measures, maintaining the current stance of policy woul d imply some tightening of the real funds rate gap relative to what you viewed as appropriate  with your easing on November 6.  Note also that this assessment is  not just a characteristic  of the staff’s outlook and empirical models (the shaded region), in that the reading of the equilibrium rate derived from the indexed debt market (t he thin line) also turned down.  With inflation also inching lower in the project ion, the Committee might view the cost of another 25 or 50 basis point easing as small given the stability of  long-run inflation expectations (the bottom pane l) relative to the benefits of some stimulus to aggregate demand.  For all the focus on weakness in hiring a nd in confidence over the intermeeting period, other data have been mixed and on net have led the staff to increase the level of real GDP in this quarter and the next compared with the baseline presented in January.  Indeed, as shown in exhib it 3, two- and ten-ye ar Treasury yields                                                 2 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).  69 of 101actually rose in the half-hour window s surrounding the key data releases represented by bars in the top left panel.  That is, as th e tally at the right indicates, the reaction to macroeconomic news cannot account for the net movement in rates since January 29.  The sharp and sudden movement in asse t prices at times over the past few weeks on rumors of war may reveal the exte nt to which the curre nt configuration of financial market quotes is only loosely te thered to economic fundamentals.  It seems that uncertainties about war and the economy are leading spenders and investors to defer commitments, but we  have no way of parsing the relative importance of those two sources of doubt.  Market prices, though, appear consistent with the overall amount of uncertainty aba ting over time.  If not, it is hard to understand why, as shown in the two middle panels, risk spreads on corporate bonds narrowed over the intermeeting peri od—as Governor Bies mentioned—or why options on swap forward rates and oil pr ices imply that volatilities are expected to move lower, as shown in the bottom panels.  Given this prevailing uncertainty and skittishness in the marketplace, the Committee might be especially unsure as to how investors would react to policy ease at this juncture.  Going back to the transcripts from the onset of the Gulf War in 1991, more than a few members doubted the efficacy of monetary policy action in spurring spending when global events were in the driver’s seat.  As the discussion about policy gra dualism at the last m eeting underscored, such uncertainties about the policy multiplier, all else being equal, would probably incline you to attenuate action, perhaps to th e point of keeping po licy on hold at this meeting.  With conflict in Iraq seemingly at hand, this is one of the few times it could be said that some aspects of uncertainty will lift with the passage of time—although to what degree and how soon are not obvious at this point.   Deferring action might also be seen as  having the advantage of allowing the Committee to calibrate its action more pr ecisely as additional information about geopolitical developments emerges.  Ind eed, the Committee might want to be able to use a significant portion of the curr ent 125 basis points of room above the zero bound in a timely fashion if events turn sufficiently adverse.  While research generally counsels that th e presence of the zero bound makes acting preemptively superior to arguments about “keepin g your powder dry,” that body of work measures time in quarters.  With war seeming about to begin, you may be measuring time in days or weeks, and it is  difficult to imagine that a short delay would leave a discernible imprint on ec onomic activity.  But the Committee might view those darker possibilities as quite  remote.  Rather, the Committee may be reading the substantial rally in financial markets when coalition troops commenced the Gulf War in 1991 as the more likely outco me.  If it is mainly worries about the world that are making households and businesses hesitant to spend, then the successful prosecution of war against Iraq should resolve some of their doubts and provide important stimulus to spending.  That said, the current situation may not be nearly as neat as in 1991 in  that concerns about geopoli tical tensions might not be 70 of 101punctured by decisive military victory, gi ven questions about the formation of a new government in Iraq, the prospect for terrorist actions, and adverse developments in other trouble spots.  If that seems farfetched, I’d remind you that we are once again at code “orange,” i ndicating heightened risks at home.    Your last exhibit, besides providing a rationale for keeping policy on hold, addresses the issue of the balance of risks assessment .  If the Committee believes that the cloud of war worri es will soon dissipate to reveal an economy that is fundamentally sound, then it shou ld indicate so by retaini ng its risk assessment as balanced with respect to both of its goals (the top left panel).  The Committee might also opt for a balanced risk assessment if it feared that a change would convey more conviction to market participants about the outlook than it actually had.  If instead, more weight were given to the downbeat economic data of late and the forecast that inflation would move lower still from its  already low level, the Committee might favor a risk assessment weighted toward economic weakness (the top right panel).  According to the survey evidence, this out come best matches investor expectations, suggesting that it should be pr eferred if the goal is not to test the market’s resilience to surprise.  Still, such a shift might be read by the broader pub lic as suggesting that the near-term outlook was weak er than feared, a message that might be problematic in a nation on a war footing.  In fact, the public’s focus has shifted to a different stage, and in light of the unusual uncerta inties, what the Committee does and says today is unlikely to be extrapol ated too far into the future.    The broader problem the Committee faces is whether it can usefully characterize the balance of risks in an e nvironment of such diffuse uncertainty.  This is territory that Frank Knight trod eighty-seven years ago.  As he noted then and as is repeated in the middle panel, “we can only appeal to the law of large numbers to distribute the losse s and make them calculable . . . in so far as they repeat themselves.”  Moreover, Knight considered circumstances when prospects were sufficiently diffuse that, as he wr ote, “The conception of an objectively measurable probability or chance is simply in applicable.”  It may be that the current situation has transited from a sense of known possibilities with assigned probabilities—that is, risk—to Knightian uncer tainty.  If so, Knight’s advice to the Committee is that “the fundamental uncertain ties of economic life are the errors in predicting the future and in making present adjustments to fit future conditions.”  If the possibilities are that uncertain, the Committee could, as outlined in the bottom panel, defer announcing an assessment of the risks under the ra tionale that it is better to be unspecific than specifically wrong.  Such a course would probably require a promise of heightened surveill ance to the public and a willingness among yourselves to convene a conference call before  the next meeting if  events clarify the odds.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very mu ch.  Questions?  If not, let me move forward.  Today’s discussion around the table pretty  much coalesced into significant alternative 71 of 101outcomes.  I believe almost everybody would ar gue that the economy is weak, and indeed I suspect on the basis of the most recent numbers that economic activity has probably been There was some significant improvement in  economic activity from Christmas through the first week in February, but the economy subsequently began to weaken measurably, evidently in conjunction but not nece ssarily in line with the significan t rise in gasoline prices that started in early February.  Gaso line pricing is like a withholding ta x, if I may put it that way, that is set by the service station ope rator.  Those who purchase gaso line know exactly what they are paying, and I would submit that many people ar e far more aware of the reduction in their disposable income coming from rising gasoline prices than they are of their weekly tax withholdings, which they probably don’t look at very cl osely.  The rise in gasoline prices has been dramatic.  Somebody mentioned earlier that th is increase might in fact be a factor in the recent weakening of motor vehicle sales. The latter  clearly has occurred, a nd that includes sales on an incentive-adjusted basis, if I may put it th at way.  With regard to the advance in gasoline prices, which in a sense is the specific result of  the current geopolitical uncertainty, we can point not only to Iraq but, as others  have mentioned, to Venezuela,  which is experiencing serious economic and political problems.  Somebody also mentioned Nigeria, which likewise is having severe difficulties. That country is a very large supp lier of oil, and its output could well go down sharply. Bob, I wasn’t aware that in Texas people are talking about the possibi lity of a near-term shutdown in Venezuelan oil produ ction.  My impression is that production has risen from a much lower level to about 2 million barrels a day in Venezuela.  That’s still well short of their 3 million barrels a day capacity.  One of the pr oblems they reportedly are having, and I’m not 72 of 101sure it’s actually true, is that some of the oi l industry workers who were  fired absconded with the software that runs many of the wells, and the Venezuelans are having trouble bringing output back toward full production.   

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Some of our contacts indica ted that their production is closer to 1.3 million than to the stated 2.9 million.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The stated 2.9 million figure, as everybody knows, is phony. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The actual number may be a litt le less than half that stated level. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, but a num ber of the oil analysts who follow Venezuela fairly closely are saying it’s 2 million.   Now, if you want to go down and look, we’ll both go down and look. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH .  If you go down and look, there could be two openings on the Committee. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You’re still tryi ng to figure out ways to improve this place?  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  There’s no uncertainty  about the risk of doing that! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In any event, I think the argument th at the geopolitical risks are affecting economic activ ity has a certain credibility, but  there is no way to know how much.  You can argue that the Ira qi and Venezuelan situations ar e having a negative effect, but you obviously can’t argue that all of the negative effect bearing on current economic activity is a result of concerns about oil.  I do think that the fact  that the economy slowed so quickly as the price of oil rose suggests that oil is playing a part.  Moreover, it is si gnificant that the stock 73 of 101moved closer.  Governor Bernanke  has noted that the hurdle rate goes up as we get closer to the event, but that presupposes a risk -neutral and not a risk-averse vi ew of the world.  So, why is it that merely moving up the time when an event will take place creates a significant change in one direction or the other when nothing has occurred to alter the way people view how things will turn out?  That should not happen unless there are very significant risk-adve rse characteristics in the market.   What we are in fact observing here, a very sh arp reaction, is evidence in my view that the Iraqi war issue is a relevant consideration.  In pa rticular, the role of Iraq strikes me as a crucial factor in light of the recent be havior of the oil, stock, and bond ma rkets. As I’ve said previously, we may think that the probability of a very favor able outcome in Iraq is 90 percent, but the 10 percent residual is very scary.  That 10 percen t continues to be very scary because nothing has happened to change the outlook significantly.  I would also note that  the acceleration in economic activity from Christmas to early February seems indicative of the fact that some fairly positive developments must have been going on in the underlying economy, which may or may not have been brought up short by the acceleration in oil prices. The point I’m trying to make is  that we should be in a far better position to assess the underlying strength of the economy once the major uncertainties about  the Iraqi war are resolved, especially if it goes the way people exp ect.  We will then be in a situation where we can better focus on the other uncertainties and f actors affecting the performance of the economy.  The erosion that has occurred in this economy in  the last five or six weeks has been quite significant, and we don’t know, of course, exactl y why that has occurred.  There are ongoing developments, which have been mentioned today, that may have more serious consequences than we can know at this point.  74 of 101The natural gas issue is a very big question.  We are drilling very h eavily for natural gas. Yet marketed production barely moves. That’s  largely because improved technology has made it possible to drain probably half th e reservoir of a new natural gas field in the first year.  Since we are putting so much of our infrastructure invest ment spending for energy production into a whole set of gas turbine based systems, our only new sour ce of gas is liquefied natural gas.  We cannot increase domestic production, and we cannot in crease our pipeline impor ts of natural gas significantly, of which something on  the order of 4 trillion cubic fe et per year are coming in from Canada.  As a consequence of that, natural gas could be a much more serious problem than we realize, and it could have a fairly signifi cant impact on the whole petrochemical industry structure, which is not a small part of this ec onomy.  That has nothing to do with Iraq, but it’s a really fundamental problem for the United States.   In general, I think that we have here, as a number of you have mentioned, a true Knightian uncertainty issue.  In the past when we  talked about the balance of risks, we presumed that we were able to judge that balance, wh ich implies some judgment of the probability distribution on both sides of the forecast.  As ma ny of you have indicated, that does not seem to be the case at this stage.  Ou r degree of uncertainty has gone up dramatically, largely because of the apparently very marked impact that the Iraqi  oil uncertainty and the other geopolitical risks are having on economic activity.  Our presumption is that, at some point  in the not-too-distant future, we will be able to turn uncertainty into actual probability distributions on which we can make judgments.  While we can consider as many hypotheses and scenarios as we think may potentially be useful, my suspicion is that we r eally don’t know.  It’s very important for us to convey to the public that we don’t know because the truth of the matter is that nobody can know.  If the Committee were to come out with either a balanced risk assessment or a sense that the 75 of 101risks are on the downside, I thi nk such a statement would be conveying more knowledge than we can possibly argue that we have. The smartest th ing we could have done last year when we set our meeting schedule for this year would have been to recognize that to day was the wrong day to hold a meeting.  [Laughter]  I tried to convey to th e Administration that we were going to have a meeting today and it wasn’t altogeth er a good idea to start a war at th is particular point.  But they must have lost my note somewhere! In any event, I think the bottom line here is th at it is important that we communicate the fact that this is truly a period in which uncertainty as distinct from risk is the dominant element in all of our deliberations.  Becau se of that as we move from un certainty toward risks, the payoff from heightened surveillance should be very large.   That is, we are going  to learn a great deal about the economy over the next several weeks.  As a consequence I think we will be in a position to address the is sue of whether we ought to be moving or not.  I do acknowledge the probability that our next move is more likely to be  a reduction than an increase in rates, but I do not base that on any knowledge that I would feel very comfortable with.  It’s more an instinctive than an intellectual judgment.  In the circumstan ces, I think we probably ought to stay where we are, indicate that we do not have the capability  of truly making a judgment about the balance of risks, but nonetheless in dicate that we continue to view th e underlying structure of the economy as consistent with a favorable outlook.   Factors supporting this assessment include  improving productivity; I think the staff forecast for this quarter is a 3 percent rate of incr ease.  This suggests that the potential for growth of profitability obviously still has considerable possibilities.  If the stock market goes up, history tells us that people who are very depressed will rapidly cheer up a good deal.  In my experience there is nothing more effective for boosting a comp any’s capital appropriat ions than having its 76 of 101stock price go up.  That shouldn’t happen, but it does.  Well, I s houldn’t say it shouldn’ t.  It does say that the market value of existing assets has gone up and therefore the opportunity cost of new assets has basically decreased.  So it is quite conceivable that, if th e stock market rallies significantly, we may find that this economy will begin to look like the Greenbook forecast.  If it doesn’t, then I think there will be a fairly strong argument that we should start to ease policy.  My impression is that we will probably know a good deal more before the next meeting.  If indeed that is the case and ac tion is required, we probably woul d be well advised to have a telephone conference and deci de whether or not there’s any acti on we wish to take or what we wish to do.  Vice Chair.

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Mr. Chairman, I assume that what you are recommending is that we do nothing today, that we have no balance of risk  statement, and that we remain very alert to developments.  A ssuming that’s what you are recommending, I’m fully in favor of it.

MR. HOENIG.  Well, I support your recomm endation, Mr. Chairman.  But I have a question for you.  Are you planning to say in the press statement that  we stand ready to move, or are you just leaving that open? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, I think what we would want to do essentially is to stipulate that because we’re presumably moving from  a period of uncertainty to one of risk we are involved in heightened surveillance, whic h implies that our policy will depend on how the situation unfolds.  For example, the stock market is up 20 percent in Europe.  If it stays there, that’s going to change a lot of th ings, but I don’t know if it’s going to stay there.  So it’s too soon to move in one way or the other. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Yes, I agree.  It wasn’t clear to me how you were planning to explain our posture to the public.  That an swer was helpful.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  I support your recommendations, Mr. Chairman.  I think, as I noted in my comments, that we really don’t know enough to say anything.  I would also agree with President Hoenig in that I would try to st ay away from building up expectati ons in the market that we are about to do something.  Although we may get clarif ication over the next few weeks, I think the probabilities are very high that we could get to the next meeti ng before we have an idea—and even then it might not be really  clear—of where things are going.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich.   

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I support the recommendations.  I’d like to say th ree other things.  First, I actually buy the Knightian uncertainty analogy and using that as a rationale for deferring the announcement of our judgment on the balance of risks.  Second, as Dave pointed out, there is a strong possibility that in fact  we’re not going to know that much  very soon for various reasons that have come up around the table, and I thi nk we want to guard against making uncertainty disabling.  That is, in my view we ought to ha ve a call in a few weeks, and we ought to be thinking about acting even in the presence of c ontinued Knightian uncertainty.  The situation that we ought to prepare ourselves for that possib ility mentally.  My third point is that the funds rate is low; and if it goes down any more, it will ge t lower still.  [Laughter]  I’m just trying to lay this out in small steps! [Laughter]  If it gets  down much lower, we’re soon going to have to confront the alternative or untra ditional measures that we’ve b een telling ourselves we have in our quiver that we can use in such circumstances.  It’s not too soon to st art thinking about what we’re going to do and also what we will look at  to know how well we ar e doing.  I believe we have to think about both and fairly soon.  79 of 101

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  May I interject a comment here?  Ned and I had a discussion about this yesterday.  We  have to be very careful, if we’re looking at new techniques, not to get ourselves involved in any pegging of intermediate- or longer-term rates.  I say that not because we couldn’t make it happen but because the problem of unwinding that sort of peg will result in utter chaos.  We have no choice but to fix the overnight rate because we’ve tried everything else and nothing else has worked.  Pegging the overnight rate  is a fallback position and one that I’m sure we would endeavor to work our way out of if we could.  If we decide that we want to move to the intermedia te rates to try to support rates, the last thing we want to do is to mention what our goal is because we will never be able to unwind from that if we get locked in to a specific pattern.  I agree with Governor Gramlich that it’s certainly not too soon to give some thought to these issues.  But we have to be careful in determining not only how we phase our way into a particular policy bu t how we phase our way out.  In many respects, the latter is far more difficult than the former. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  Mr. Chairman, the present Manager of the System Open Market Account and I, as a previous Mana ger, are absolutely in agreement with you.  We cannot peg an intermediate rate.  It would be very, very dangerous to try to do that.

It ma y be that a call wouldn’t necessarily be scheduled only for the purpose of considering a policy change.  If we’re going to  have the events that we’re all anticipating imminently, it seems to me that a call next week or even— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Next week will be too soon.  We won’t know enough in a week. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I’m thinking only in terms of getting updates from the staff about how things are unfolding, not in terms of  any consideration of policy action. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, what is the Committee’s general view on this?  I remember that at the time of the October 1987 st ock market crash we had daily conference calls for general updates. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  We did. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don’t think a dail y call is required, bu t if you’re talking just about basic updates, is there interest in doing that? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  I’d suggest weekly.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, perhaps weekly. MR. PARRY.  Fine. MS. MINEHAN.  That’s a great idea. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  One of the advantag es of doing that, incidentally, is that the interaction among the Committee members will creat e a higher level of insight as to what is going on.  Too often that kind of discussion would be  a waste of time.  I don’t think it would be in this case.  So shall we commit to that? 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Yes. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay, let’s do it.  President Stern. 81 of 101

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I support your recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Mr. Chairman, I support your  recommendation on the intended federal funds rate, but I have a question about the other two aspects of it.   I agree completely with your rationale and your discussion about the difficulty of assessing the balance of risks.  What I’m concerned about is that people in  the markets didn’t hear our discussion on that and it may be very difficult to convey our meaning.  I think we  want to be careful that we don’t create any uncertainties that produce more problems than we’re  trying to solve. That’s one concern I have.  My second concern relates to the issue of he ightened surveillance.  I think the markets understand that we’re always on the job.  Therefore,  my concern is that people may look at that and think we’re likely to do something in response to an event when in fact the event falls short of a situation in which we would want to act.  So my concern relates to how we accurately convey our intent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, I think we ca n try, but we will never succeed in that respect.  There’s no way of so manipulating the views and attitude s of the marketplace that we can expect to alter them in a period like this.  Wh en there is continuity in  the marketplace, I think we do convey our intent, and I thi nk we do it rather well.  But this  is a discontinuous event with very significant implications.  We are not going to avoid the general reactions that may best be characterized as the market trying to figure out what this group is  going to do at any particular point in time.  We have to grin and bear it and do what we think is right, and that problem will gradually disappear.  It should not be a problem that, at least in my judgment, will create a big 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.  I agree. 82 of 101

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, I can accept your recommendation.  I have some of the same kinds of reservations and concerns th at Bill Poole just expressed.  I understand your rationale, and I think it makes sense.  But this is a change, and I’m nervous because I don’t know how the markets and the public more broadly are going to accept it.  So when we write our statement, I think the choice of langua ge is going to be very important.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, the draft lan guage does try to deal with that.  I’ll circulate the draft so you’ll get a sense of what it tries to convey.  Let me just say this, however.  There is no way we can get this done without a pa rt of the market distorting what it is we’re trying to do.  I know of no words th at we can use to avoid that.  

[SECTION]

MR.  BROADDUS.  I agree. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Basically, the only questions we have to be concerned about are, does it undermine the structure of the market or does it significantly affect the credibility of this institution?  I think the answer is “no” in both  cases.  But I’m also confronted with Knightian uncertainty in this respect. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  If I could, I’d like to fo llow up briefly on the conversation you were having with Ned a minute ago.  I would urge the Committee to think a bit more fully about how we would deal with the risk of deflation, and espe cially public concern about deflation if that hits us, should we get into a situation where we’re cl oser to the zero bound.  I personally don’t think deflation is a major current threat.  I’m probably one of the mo re sanguine members of the group here in that regard, and maybe  it’s odd for me to be the one making this statement.  Looking ahead, however, I do think that deflation is ar guably a more serious po tential problem than inflation for the intermediate term, and I don’t think we can assume that the confidence the 83 of 101public has in the Fed to contain inflation necessar ily carries over to deflation.  We don’t have a very good track record in dealing with deflation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We had only one event. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  That’s right. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We’re 0 for 1. MR. BROADDUS.  In any case, while I don’t exp ect this, it’s not hard for me to imagine events unfolding in such a way in the current period of volatile situations that we could find ourselves approaching the zero boun d.  Actually, I think it’s easy  to imagine a situation where the funds rate moves below 1 percent fairly abrup tly.  I’m not anticipating that, but it’s certainly possible to imagine it.  If the funds rate moves below 1 percent, the public’s concern about exactly how we’re going to deal with a deflationa ry situation is going to intensify quickly.  We need to be prepared to answer those kinds of que stions and assure the pub lic that what has been happening in Japan is not going to happen here.  While we at the Federal Reserve have made a couple of public statements regarding deflation, we  haven’t said very much.  I think we’re going to be pressed to say much more if we get in this situation.  For our own benefit, among other things, I think we need to c onsider how we would measure th e stance of policy and discuss policy operationally in the nei ghborhood of the zero bound.  For example, one question is, will we have an operating instrument that will be a su bstitute for the funds rate if we are at zero or very close to zero?  If so, we  have to have some way of instructing the Desk on how to implement policy.  I don’t know what that instru ment would be, so we need to think about whether we are going to have one and what it would be.   My own view is that it would be helpful, to me  at least, if the sta ff could give us a “think piece” that might suggest in some detail what a Bluebook at the zero bound might look like.  84 of 101What kinds of alternatives would be  presented there?  In any event,  I think getting out in front of this issue would help us avoid making policy mistakes and also help prevent public confusion and fear that might make the situ ation worse than it needs to be.  We may think we have time to do this, but I’m not sure we do.  We could find ourselves in a situati on like this relatively quickly.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I agree.  I don’t think we have much time, but I believe we’ve done a lot more thinking about this than is implied by your remarks.  The real danger here is that this market is running up on the expectation that the real problem is the Iraqi war, that we are going to get the Iraqi war re solved, and that there’s an in creasing likelihood that nirvana exists somewhere out there.  If indeed there are far more deep structural imbalances in the system than we perceive or than the market perceives, then the economy could turn around very quickly.  In other words, in my view the de flation you’re concerned about cannot exist unless there is an asset price deflation.  The possibility that there will be a false run-up that fails to take hold is a perfectly credible scenar io, and the reactions could be quite  significant.  In that event, I think we would have to move in a very exped itious manner.  But you’re  raising a question of what type of move we would make, and there ha s been quite a lot of thinking on that question. 

[SECTION]

 MR. REINHART.  Actually, Mr. Chairman, I have had the staff start a fact book on the zero bound situation, which will list the unusual ac tions mentioned in the recent speeches by you and Governor Bernanke.  It will include the au thority under which the ac tions can be taken and any historical precedent.  The work has been fairly closely held because I had some concerns about what would happen were it to become  known that we were actively engaged in contingency plans about the zero bound.  I’ve also asked the staff to look into some other issues, such as whether difficulties are posed alrea dy by the compression of deposit rates and money 85 of 101fund rates.  So, we are looking at  that and questioning whether there are any other consequences for the functioning of money markets—problems th at the Bank of Japan sometimes complains about—that would possibly inclin e you to resort to unusual po licy actions before you get the nominal funds rate to zero.  I know that Dino, wo rking with the Research Department at the New York Fed, has been looking into th ese issues as well.  I guess it might be helpful to get a little guidance from the Committee about whether there is a memo in my future.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, you are look ing at the question of at what point money market funds run into trouble and at the timing of other structur al difficulties in the system that may occur well be fore we get to the zero bound. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  People are working on a couple of aspects of that.  We’re looking at it in terms of depositories, the compression of deposit rates and money fund rates, and just generally wondering about market functioning.  For instance, if the general collateral rate is ½ percent, then the unattractiven ess of failing to deliver securiti es is not partic ularly high.   

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  I would argue two things, Mr. Chairman.  One relates to your last point, which is similar to what Al Broaddus had to say.  It’s not the zero bound that is necessarily driving this.  Second, obviously on September 11 or shortly thereafter, we saw some of this as we were pumping a lot of liquidity into the markets.  It will be very intere sting to see if anything came out of that because we ar e talking about exactly that sa me kind of quantitative activity, though for a different purpose obviously. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  I support both parts of the recommendation. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 86 of 101

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I support the recommendation, too, and I’m delighted to hear that this contingency pla nning is already under way.  I cert ainly hope we never have to use it, but I think it is important that we do the plan ning now.  I have just one  comment regarding the phrase “heightened surveillance.”  I hope we’re go ing to use that phrase or something like it in the press statement because I know that market an alysts have discovered that every time we’ve used the words “monitor carefully” in the pa st we have had a move between meetings. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We’ve c hosen not to use that wording. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I’m delighted. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  I agree that we should not ma ke a policy change at this meeting.  Now is not the time to move.  My desire would be to stay as low key as we po ssibly can and let things play out over the next couple of weeks whatever way they’re going to play out.  The second part of your recommendation I have a b it more trouble with.  I do think the risks are on the downside, and I don’t see a big problem with saying that.  When we characte rize the risks, we talk about them for the “foreseeable future.”  Certainly the long-term fundamentals continue to be good—productivity, inflation credibility—but for the foreseeable future, some of the short-term fundamentals are kind of dicey.  There are concerns  about excess capacity in the case of business investment and concerns about employment, income, and the potential for declines in house prices on the consumer side.  So I do think that  the risks are on the downs ide, recognizing that uncertainty clouds our ability to a ssess exactly where the risks are. I can go along with the recommendation to chan ge the format in our press statement.  I think the market is going to read  that, particularly in  the context of your recent testimony or one of your speeches—I forget which—as basically sayi ng that there is a probability of an uptick 87 of 101after uncertainty abates and attr ibuting that uncertainty clearly to the war.  In my view, the move to the downside, so I guess I don’t have much  of a problem with that.  But frankly, I think saying that the risks are to the downside is better because it keeps us closer to the norm and takes us more out of play.  To me doing something di fferent puts a little more focus on the central bank than I think is desirable at this point, but  on balance I don’t have a big problem with it. I’d also like to associate myself with Ned Gramlich’s perspective that uncertainty itself can be paralyzing.  I remember reading the disc ussion from the last meeting where we thought we’d have a lot more information by March 18.  As it turns out, we don’t have a lot more information. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, that was my forecast. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Well, we don’t have a lot more  information as of March 18, and I don’t know whether we’re going to have a lot more information by early May. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Actually we do have more information. MS. MINEHAN.  More negative information. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, not necessarily.   MS. MINEHAN.  The war is starting. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Incidentally, rememb er that I testified as I did regarding the probabilities of a strengthening economy beca use that was consistent with the actual forecasts of the members of this Committee. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That’s right. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I was locked  into explaining why everybody had an accelerating growth forecast back in late January. 88 of 101

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That’s right. I shouldn’t have laid it so much at your doorstep.  That was what we said in our forecasts as of the January meeting because those forecasts picked up the trend from the end of last year  and into the early weeks of this year.  That’s clear.  But I think the market is going to read the absence of a statem ent of risks as effectively a move slightly to the downside.  I’m okay with that, but I woul d hope, along the line of Ned’s comments, that uncertainty does not paralyze us 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It really hasn ’t in the past.  We have moved on innumerable occasions when we didn’t have very much of a clue as to how the markets were evolving.  Governor Bernanke. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Mr. Chairman, I support both parts of the recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. MR. MCTEER.  So do I. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do  we have anybody else? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOU GH.  That does it. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Now for the high moment of the day, what are you going to read? 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  Well, what I will be reading is from page 13 in the Bluebook. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, what we  vote on is the language shown in the Bluebook.  

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  The directive wording is the following:  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and fina ncial conditions that will foster  price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent  with maintaining the fe deral funds rate at an average of around 1¼ percent.” 89 of 101

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would you circulate the draft press statement?  Is that generally acceptable?   

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDON OUGH.  Bravo! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Hearing no objecti on, the last item on the agenda is the date of our next meeting. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  May 6. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Our next offici al meeting is May 6, but we will be meeting, obviously, via weekly telephone conferen ces.  I suspect the first one will be next Tuesday.  We will do it on Tuesdays.  We’ll have  the staff circulate a questionnaire to try to determine what times would be most convenient for the majority of members to have those telephone conferences in vi ew of the fact that a lot of people have previous commitments.  We’ll try to work it out in a way that is least disruptive.  Okay?    We have no luncheon agenda, so those of you who would like to catch a plane may wish to leave before lunch.
