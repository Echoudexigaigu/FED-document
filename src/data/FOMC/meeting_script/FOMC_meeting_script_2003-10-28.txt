CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We’re ready to start our meeting.  Would somebody like to move the minutes of the September meeting? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  I’ll move the minutes of that meeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Wit hout objection they are approved.  Dino, you’re on. MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the charts that were circulated a short while ago.  During the fi rst part of the intermeeting period, market participants looked at incomi ng data and concluded that the glass was half empty.  Then for most of October, they tended to s ee the glass as half full.  Interest rate developments largely mirrored these shif ting views.  The other topic that has occupied markets in the aftermath of the G-7 summit in Dubai is the dollar’s exchange rate and the feedback effects that  a further fall in the dollar might have on asset markets.    The top panel on page 1 graphs U.S. a nd euro-area three-month cash deposit rates and the three-month rate three, six, and nine months forward.  During much of starting with the September employment numb ers, released on October 3, the outlook began to take on a more positive tone.  GDP forecasts were upwardly revised, and forward rates started moving higher.  Co mments by President Parry and Treasury Secretary Snow in mid-Oct ober caused market participan ts to price in a higher likelihood that short-term rate s would rise sooner than had been anticipated.  But that flurry of angst quickly ebbed as stock prices began to give back some of their gains after news of disappointing outlooks from a couple of bellwether companies.  On balance, forward rates are roughly where they were in late August.  Short-term rates in the euro area, both cash and forward (the  green lines) traversed the same general path as U.S. rates, as the outlook there was also perceived to be a bit more positive.  Once again, euro area rates tended to show a more pronounced reaction to U.S. data and announcements than to European ones.    Yields in the Treasury market also followe d the same general pattern, as shown in the bottom two panels on page 1.  When ten-year yields briefly fell below 4 percent, some market strategists speculated that  another wave of convexity hedging by mortgage accounts might kick in.  In the ev ent, that did not mate rialize.  However, even without that, Treasury yields acro ss the curve were choppy on a day-to-day                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). 3 of 126basis.  The ten-year note of May 2013, whic h is now once off the run, has continued to trade with a high degree of scarcity va lue in financing markets and with a high level of fails.  In ear lier meetings when I was asked a bout the fails situation, I said that it was largely a back-office event that had not spilled over into the cash market.  However, in the past week we have noted a decrease in transaction volume in this note, and it has begun trading very rich re lative to the current on-the-run ten-year note.  The May ten-year not e is now yielding about 15 basis points less than the on-the-run August ten-year note, and the issu e is trading at negative rates in the repo  Despite the ups and down of the Treasury market, spreads continued to narrow, as shown at the top of page 2. The investment-gra de spread (shown in the top left panel) continued to narrow.  This index hit a low of 103 basis poi nts on October 20.  The last time the spread was that narrow was in April 1999.  High-yield and emerging-market debt spreads also narrowed, as shown in  the right panel.  The high-yield index narrowed to a low of 453 basis points, the lo west level in about 4 years, while the EMBI+ spread hit its lowest level in 5½ y ears.  A year ago the spreads on both of these indexes were at about  1,000 basis points.  While a narrowing of spreads is expected during an economic rebound as the quality of cred it improves, several strategists are voicing concer ns about whether a liquid ity-driven rally has pushed spreads to unsustainable levels—particul arly in the emerging-market sector.  The apparent lack of fear also showed  through in some volatility indexes.  The middle panel graphs the volatility index on the S&P 100, also known as the VIX.  On years.  Now, one volatility m easure that rose was that of the dollar’s exchange rate.  The bottom panel graphs the one-month imp lied volatility of the euro–dollar and dollar–yen exchange rates. As shown in that panel, the volatility of the dollar–yen exchange rate, which had been trapped in  a narrow range by Japanese intervention, spiked higher—from 8 percent to more th an 12 percent in the days surrounding the Dubai summit and coincident with the suspen sion of Japanese intervention activity.  The G-7 summit in Dubai gave the markets a lot to mull over.  The dollar had already been under downward pressure before the su mmit.  That, coupled with statements from the Administration earlier in Sept ember pushing for more exchange rate flexibility among Asian currencies, made the markets look cautiously toward the summit, but most observers did not expect much from the communiqué.  In the event, reaction to the communiqué ranged along a wi de spectrum.  Some viewed it as a milestone that finally buried the so-called “strong dollar” policy; some were confused about what, if anything, the G-7 was saying; and some we re convinced that nothing had changed and that the communiqué did not  signify any policy shifts by the G-7.  In that environment it is not surprisi ng that the dollar continued under some downward pressure.  The top panel on the next  page graphs the euro’s value against the dollar.  After a dip in late August, th e euro appreciated sharply in the run-up to Dubai and in subsequent days.  European pol icymakers at that poi nt were expressing 4 of 126some concern that the bulk of any adjust ment to the dollar’s exchange rate would have to be borne by the euro if many Asian currencies in particular continued to be fixed against the dollar.  Asian currencies appreciated somewhat against the dollar, as shown in the middle panel, with the excep tion of the Chinese yuan, which continued at its fixed rate.  Some central banks reacted with traditional intervention to stem the rise of their currencies; others resorted to  capital controls, restri ctions on access to local banking systems, and various form s of moral suasion.  Although the Chinese yuan spot rate stayed fixed, the upward pr essure on the yuan s howed through in the nondeliverable forward (NDF) market where the one-year NDF implies a 4.0 percent appreciation of the currency.  The Hong K ong dollar also strengthened in the days after Dubai, at first without actions fro m the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  Given the currency board system in Hong Kong, th e lack of intervention surprised those who were short Hong Kong dollars and had perceived the currency board to be symmetric.  The actions taken by a number of central banks in the region have added a sense of two-way risk to Asian currency rates, which perhaps was lacking before.  A less favorable view expressed by some was that a new risk premium had been introduced into Asian markets.  In any case, with reserve levels in Asia rising, traders are asking a number of questions:  What is the end game for this process?  How do these countries counter capital inflows?  Do  the central banks have  the instruments to sterilize their foreign exchange interventions ?  And that list does n’t even include the broader macroeconomic questions that are re levant, such as the risks of overheated economies.  The bottom panel graphs the dol lar–yen exchange rate.  That rate had traded in a narrow range until September 16, when the Japanese stopped intervening.  The rate promptly depreciated sharply to  the 110 region, whereupon the Ministry of Finance (MOF) again resumed intervention.  This morning the yen/dollar exchange rate hit a three-year low of  108.10 amid token intervention by the authorities.  During the period, the MOF purchased $25½ billion, including $400 million that the Desk purchased as agent on behalf of  the Japanese authorities.  Given the large scale of Japanese intervention this year, I tho ught I’d spend a few minutes on this topic.  The top panel of page 4 depicts net year ly intervention by the Japanese monetary authorities since 1989.  With two months left in 2003, the MOF’s intervention exceeds $139 billion so far th is year—more than double the previous high.  The middle panel shows how Japanese intervention has evolved over the years.  Each dot is a daily interventi on purchase or sale of dolla rs over the period from 1989 to date.  Between 1989 and mid-1995, Japanese  interventions tended to be frequent, but each operation was relatively modest in si ze—at least by later standards.  With a change in leadership at the Ministry of Finance in mid-1995 came a different intervention style.  Over th e next seven years, Japanese  intervention episodes were much less frequent but much larger in si ze.  Individual operations were frequently larger than $5 billion and in a few cases more than $10 billion.  Ironically, the largest single operation is—appropr iately perhaps—off the chart and was a sale of $20 billion dollars in April 1998.  For refe rence purposes, the largest dollar–yen intervention by the U.S. monetary authorities was $833 million in June 1998.  Since the beginning of 2003—coinci ding with another leadership change at the MOF—Japanese intervention tactics ha ve shifted yet again;  interventions this year have been 5 of 126frequent and large.  In short, the two pr evious styles have been combined.  The bottom panel looks at the effect of Japane se interventions on volatility during the major intervention episodes in the last nine  years.  The red bars show the intraday range, expressed in yen, on days the MOF did not intervene, and the blue bars show the range on days when it did intervene.  Since intervention typically imparts some information to the markets—whether that is  intended or not—markets generally react with a higher degree of movement than usual,  and volatility rises.  Indeed, that is the pattern we observe.  However, during the Ja nuary to July 2003 pe riod, this traditional and expected pattern does not apply.  The daily range was actually lower on intervention days, suggesting that intervention was constraining the “normal” elbow room, if you will, that the exchange rate uses  in a typical day.  That is also consistent with a strategy that appeared to be aime d at preventing the exchange rate from moving further rather than at attempting to engineer a reversal.  Mr. Chairman, once again, the Desk did not conduct any foreign operations in this period. I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It looks as though  each of the two types of intervention operations had some modest effect on the exchan ge rate and, when combined, that disappears.  Do I infer from what you’re saying that the tw o earlier MOF regimes act ually had some modest effect on the exchange rate but the combined method did not? MR. KOS.  Well, I’m not sure I would go that far. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I knew you wouldn’t!  [Laughter] MR. KOS.  Academics have long argued about th e effect of interven tion.  Certainly the size of the Japanese intervention ha s been incredible this year.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s even argua ble as to whether it’s sterilized. MR. KOS.  That’s yet another se t of issues.  Nevertheless, th e rate is about 12 yen lower than it was at the end of last year despite th is very, very large inte rvention.  Compounding the situation is the question of whether th e intervention is sterilized or not. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’ve been wondering out loud recently whether the extraordinarily significant bias on the part of commerc ial banks and households in Japan not to engage in a significant way in the purchase of fo reign assets—far more so than is true in the 6 of 126world at large—is a factor.  Does carrying that ov er into the international exchange market create a bias in favor of the yen?  If so, that essentially means that the equilibrium price of the yen vis-à-vis the dollar would tend to be higher than would ordinarily be  the case if there were capital flows more reminiscent of what we’ve seen in  the past in Europe and the United States. MR. KOS.  I don’t think I would argue with that.  In fact, one of the points that commentators have made over the years is that, in the absence of the Japanese financial system being able to recycle these funds, it is left to the authorities, through intervention, to do that.  Even so, the scale of this year’s intervention is very large and far ex ceeds the current account surplus.  So they’re recycling the current account and then some .  The amount of intervention is quite pronounced this year. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  My second question relates to the issue of how the foreign exchange markets are functioning.  There is consid erable bias in forecasts currently toward a weaker dollar, largely as a conse quence of the rising U.S. current account deficit.  Yet we’re all taught, and the markets seem to suggest, that the spot rate captures all of  the forward supply and demand as well as the spot through arbitrage op erations.  Largely because of the over-the-counter derivatives market one can go out ten, fift een years in any of these major currencies.  Consequently there is an arbitrag ing interaction along the maturity schedule of forward contracts, which ultimately fixes the spot rate.  If that is indeed the case, it suggests that all market knowledge is effectively embodied in the spot rate  and that, therefore, forecasting a change is a contradiction in terms.  Is it co rrect to say that these foreign exchange markets are sufficiently sophisticated and deep that essentially all of the information is embodied in the spot rate so that forecasting is based on the presumption that one knows something that the market does not know? 7 of 126MR. KOS.  I have watched foreign exchange markets for about eleven years, which is nowhere near as long as you’ve been watchi ng them, and I would never want to forecast exchange rates because it seems so impossible to do.  So that’s my first point.  On your second question—whether the spot rate captures all the information that is knowable—I wouldn’t even want to venture a guess.  I don’t know if Karen wa nts to give us some views on this question. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Well, I’m foolishly going to o ffer to say something on this subject!  [Laughter]  The dilemma with the arbitrage reasoning that you have  accurately laid out is that one end or the other of the term structure of exchange rates implied by it needs to be nailed down in some way for that by itself to tell you where the spot rate should be.  Regrettably, that’s the piece that is missing.  It’s not th at the arbitrage conditions fail, and it’s not that the respective interest rate differentials don’t gi ve you a whole term structure at some level of movement in the spot rates.  The problem is that nowh ere is it attached to a level.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Alge braically I don’t necessarily  agree with you.  In other words, let’s say we have an aggregate s upply and demand for a commodity—the reasoning works the same way for a commodit y—with segregation with respect to the time frame.  There is a sense in which the aggregate supply and demand e quate to get an average price, and that term structure is essentially a functi on of the different levels of s upply and demand along that period spectrum. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  But the magic term is “a ggregate supply.”  What pins down the aggregate supply of a currency? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’m not saying what  pins it down; I’m just saying that it exists.  Algebraically you have enou gh observations to solve the problem. 8 of 126

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  In real time on a given day, at a particular minute, a certain supply exists and the price equates demand to it, yes.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That’s all I’m saying. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  But in an attempt, based on theoretical reasoning, to determine what shocks should do to that system or what the futu re rate should be and so forth, the issue is that the supply of a currency has no economics be hind it.  The supply could be anything. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don’t know what those words mean. MS. JOHNSON.  There are no parameters of a supply curve that are driven by incentives as there would be, say, if we were talking about the price of lumber  in a year.  For example, one can think about the reasoning be hind the actions of the people w ho buy lumber and of the people who sell lumber.  And one could, rightly or wro ngly, write down curves that describe that behavior and thus predict a price based on them.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, I’m just saying that there is a futures price for lumber.  And I would submit that al l along the curve of the futures ma rket for lumber is in effect an arbitraging operation, which is  fixed at a level that encompasses the aggregate demand and supply all the way out on the futures curve. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  But recall that each exchange rate involves two currencies.  So in the case we’re discussing, one is implicitly talking about  the supply of dollars and the supply of yen.  While a certain supply exists in calendar time at this moment, nothing predetermines the supply of either currency going forward.  Both of those variables might move in a way that markets can’t predict.  So the arbitrage theory— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I acknowledge that the markets can’t predict; that’s the problem.  But unless somebody insists that this i ssue is important to th e decision we have to 9 of 126make today, [laughter] I think you and I should go in  the corner of the room  later and argue this out with each other. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Wise suggestion. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That’s all I ha ve.  Does anybody else want to ask a question? 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  If one thinks of the Japanese  authorities as specula tors, it’s generally assumed that if speculation is stab ilizing it’s profitable .  If it’s not profitabl e, it’s destabilizing.  Do we know anything about how much money the Japanese have earned or lost on these interventions? MR. KOS.  In a recent paper, Professor Ito calculated that the Japanese actually have made significant profits because of the carry—the  interest rate spread between the cost of financing, which has been essentia lly zero in the last few years, and what they’ve earned on their treasuries.  So there has been a significant pr ofit.  Exchange rates have fluctuated, and the Japanese have been buying at different rates.  But on the whole apparen tly the intervention has been quite profitable for them. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Anybody else? MR. POOLE.  Is there any regular pattern or ex pected pattern in Japan as to what fraction of the intervention is sterilized? MR. KOS.  The way that the MOF finances it s intervention is that it issues financing bills, which in the first instance are underwritten  by the Bank of Japan.  Subsequently, some number of weeks later, the MOF sells new financing bills to the market, and then it can refinance and repay the Bank of Japan.  So  the one-to-one yen relationship that one would typically see when a central bank is intervening, we really don’t see because of the secondary route, which 10 of 126then gets unwound.  Now, when I spoke to people at the Bank of Japan about this issue, they didn’t see what the fuss was about.  Their view is that the MOF is doing its thing, we’re doing our thing, and we don’t think of it in terms of sterilizing foreign ex change intervention.  They’re looking at it in terms of targeting current account balances—full stop.  

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  So essentially the mechanism involves full sterilization of the exchange it sounded to me.   MR. KOS.  Yes, but what I’m describing is the mechanism involved and what the people at the Bank of Japan have said to me.   

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Okay. MR. KOS.  I’m confident in sayi ng that this is not unsterilized  intervention.  I think that’s as far as I want to go.  Whether it’s something in  between—a little of this  and a little of that—I’m not so sure about that.   

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Thank you. MR. FERGUSON.  Could I move us from Japan to the subject of page 2, where you gave an impression of some concern about what I’d call financial stability?  You commented about a lack of fear with regard to th e dramatic drop in corporate debt spreads.  I would say that what you were pointing out is certainly factual and correct  in the fixed-income markets.  In the equity wonder if you’re right to talk about the lack of fear in fi xed-income markets or if that is simply a reflection of the fact that intere st rates globally are relatively low.  Could it be that what we’re 11 of 126seeing is what one naturally would expect to  see in a low interest rate, low inflation environment?  MR. KOS.  I think you make a good point that sp read relationships in a low interest rate don’t want to overstate what is depicted here on page 2.  I thought it was somewhat noteworthy that we were seeing some interesting levels that we hadn’t seen in a while.  As for the equity volatility, I would take your point that these kinds of volatility num bers were not unusual in the early 1990s.  So I would agree with that.  They are low, however, compared with the late 1990s and early 2000s.  On the fixed-income side, it’s not a question of fear but that in some quarters at least I think there’s a degree of di scomfort with the level of the spread relationships, especially on emerging-market debt.   

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Governor Ferguson, may I ju st add an observation?  It is a low inflation, low interest rate environment.  It’s also one of an improving U.S. economy. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Right. MR. REINHART.  So for domestic assets it ma y very well be the case that investors are thinking that recovery rates in th e event of default may be better  and the default risk itself may be lower.  Spreads could be narrowing independently  of investors’ aversion to risk because their perception of the risk has gone down. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Good, thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If there are no further questions, would somebody like to move to ratify the domestic open market operations?   

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  I’ll move to ratify th e domestic open market operations. 12 of 126

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  W ithout objection.  We turn now to Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairma n.  Karen and I will attempt to be brief this morning.  We suspect th at this may be an occasion where we may have an easier time explaining our economic outlook to you than you will have figuring out how to explain your economic outlook to others.   As a consequence, we intend to yield back the balance of our time to Vincent Reinhart.  In a nutshell, things have been going ve ry well for the U.S. economy in recent weeks.  The data have been coming in almost uniformly stronger than we had expected six weeks ago.  The latest piece of news fitting that pattern was this morning’s release of the September re port on new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods.  New orders outside  of aircraft were up nearly 4 percent last month, after having been about flat in August.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were up 2.5 percent in September, more than reversing the probably lead us to add about 1 percenta ge point to the projected growth of equipment spending in both the third and the fourth quarters, bringing the increases to 13 percent and 12 percent, respectivel y.  However, the report also showed manufacturers’ durable inve ntories liquidating even fa ster than we expected.  On balance, the data that we have re ceived since the close of the Greenbook would leave unaltered our estimate of the increase in real GDP in the third quarter of 6¼ percent at an annual rate, a figure nearly 2 percentage points above that in the sales, with notable positive innovations in consumption, housing, government outlays, and net exports.  No doubt, some of  the burst in spending last quarter was simply borrowed from the future.  Most not able in that regard, we are interpreting some of the unexplained strength in consum ption as reflecting a more rapid response than we had anticipated to this summer’s reduction in personal income taxes.  As a consequence, we lowered our projected increas e in real PCE in the fourth quarter to offset some of the th ird-quarter surprise.  But in other areas, the data appear to be signaling greater unde rlying strength in demand.  Housing stands out as the most prominent example.  Starts, permits, and sales have all been phenomenal of late.  As  a consequence, we marked up our forecast of residential investment across the projec tion period.  Yesterday’s release on sales of new and existing homes for September cert ainly supports that decision.  New home sales maintained their recent robust p ace of about 1.15 million units; and existing sales clocked in at 6.7 million units, estab lishing yet another record for the series.  Netting areas of payback against those of  greater momentum, we revised down the projected increase in real GDP in the f ourth quarter by ¼ percentage point to just under 4½ percent.  Needless to say, that is only a small offset to the sizable third-13 of 126quarter surprise.  This morning’s orders figures suggest that we may be undoing even that small downward revision.  When coupled with some slight further upward revision to growth in 2004 and 2005—largely  reflecting the weak er exchange value of the dollar in this forecast—these re visions imply a level of real GDP about ½ percent above that in the September Greenbook throughout the projection period.  That said, I see the changes that we have made to this projection as largely being ones of degree.  The basic forces that we ha d earlier expected to be at work in the economy now appear to be showing through in  the data.  Low interest rates and a surge of disposable income generated by ta x cuts have provided a powerful stimulus to household spending, especially on durable goods and housing.  Moreover, low interest rates, together with a waning av ersion to risk, sharp gains in corporate profitability, rising sales, a nd the partial-expensing tax provisions appear to be creating a considerably more hospitable c limate for business investment.  While the pattern has been choppy, outlays for defense have also been providing a sizable boost to activity in recent months.  Perhaps even more encouraging, some of the areas that gave us, and probably many of you, greatest pause about our for ecast in mid-September have shown some tentative signs of improvement in recent weeks.  Industrial production has firmed a bit of late, with notable strength in th e production of high-t ech goods, especially computers and semiconductors.  The national and regional purchasing managers’ indexes suggest that further increases are in train this month.  There are also signs of a nascent recovery in labor markets.  Private payrolls expanded by 72,000 in Initial claims have been averaging close to 390,000 this month, and insured unemployment has moved lower—suggesting th at layoffs may have abated some and that hiring may be turning the corner.  Could the surprising strength of such a broad array of economic indicators be signaling the start of an even more vigorous  expansion than we are projecting?  The answer, of course, is “yes.”  Much of th e strength in private spending has been in interest-sensitive areas such as autos, other consumer durables, housing, and capital equipment.  It is certainly conceivable that we are underestimating the potency of zero real interest rates.  The recent w eakening of the dollar might be another indication that the current st ance of policy is delivering gr eater stimulus to activity than we have been projecting.  Another explanation for the recent pickup in activity could be that business cauti on is in the process of fa ding.  As you know, we expect the unusual restraint on busine ss spending and hiring to have largely dissipated by the middle of next year.  If business sentiment were to improve more rapidly than we are anticipating, the accompanying step-up in the pace of hiring, capital spending, and inventory investment could make the next few quarters look a lot more like a normal business cycle recovery than we currently expect.  I must admit that, in preparing this briefing, I was struck by how often I was struggling to find synonyms for strength.  Over  the past three years, I had developed a 14 of 126reasonably complete list of substitutes for w eakness.  But lest you fear that we have fallen prey to the sin of conviction concer ning our forecast of sustained expansion, let me assure you that we remain capable of conjuring dark thoughts about the outlook.  Indeed, there are still some very palpab le downside risks to our forecast.    For one, neither we nor anyone else should have much confidence in an ability to parse out the effects of this summer’s drop in personal tax rates and the issuance of rebate checks on the time profile of consum er spending.  Our calculations rely more on judicious assumption than on hard em pirical evidence, so the uncertainty surrounding these estimates is large.  Maybe the recent strength in consumer spending has been mainly the consequence of the ta x cuts and, because we have experienced little or no growth in labor income, spending will shortly peter out.  Some circumstantial evidence could be seen as  supporting this hypothesis.  Chain store sales—an admittedly poor predictor of broader consumer spending—have dropped back in recent weeks after popping up this su mmer, and the reports that we hear from the automakers are that sales have dropped from spectacular to merely good in recent weeks.  It is also possible that some of the st rength in business spending will prove to be transitory.  Before the war began in March, one of the explanations for the so-called soft patch was that, given the enormous un certainties, businesses were putting capital spending projects on hold.  Maybe the noticeable  upturn in orders si nce the spring is a temporary bulge that reflects the implem entation of those previously deferred Such a possibility might square with the limited and guarded guidance that companies have provided for revenues and profits going forward, despite the spectacular gains many have experienced recently.  There are also ample reasons to discount the available signs of improvement in the labor market.  We have seen similar pe riods of false hope over the past couple of years.  Private payrolls improved a year a go, only to fall back most of this year.  Moreover, both initial claims and in sured unemployment dropped to levels comparable to those we are currently observing on three other occasions during the past three years.  Obviously, none of those occurrences ultimatel y proved a precursor to sustained expansion.  False positives were not just a feature of  the labor market data.  The purchasing managers’ indexes showed improvement similar to that seen recently in early 2002, and industrial production posted a brief period of  increase in the middle of that year.  With investors apparently pricing in subs tantial odds that a mo re vigorous expansion is under way, any perceptible disappointment on that front could feed back negatively through financial markets onto the real econom y. That would put at risk our forecast that output will grow rapidly enough to make a dent in the current margin of underutilized capacity.  15 of 126We have taken some comfort from the greater synchronicity  of the positive signals in the current episode  relative to those earlier fa lse starts.  Moreover, unlike 2002, the pickup in activity to date has been driven by a strengthening of private final demands, which are now increasing more ra pidly than at any time since the late 1990s.  Still, we will need to see more ev idence before we can confidently confirm the sustained above-trend expansion that we have been predicting.  In contrast to the many surprises in  the spending and production data, price developments have been unfolding pretty much  as we had expected.  We continue to believe that the economy has the capacity to  grow rapidly over the next two years without putting upward pressure on inflation.  Slack in resource utilization diminishes only slowly in our forecast , with the unemployment rate expected to decline to 5½ percent by the end of 2004 and to 5 percent by the end of 2005.  Likewise, manufacturing capacity utiliza tion rises from its current level of around 73 percent to only 78 percent at the close of 2004 and just above 80 percent by the end of 2005.  In short, available capacity combined with continued strong gains in  structural labor productivity should keep a lid on cost pre ssures.  Meanwhile, there have been few signs that inflation expectations have dete riorated in any material manner, and given our benign outlook for prices, we think th e odds are low that expectations will become unglued over the next two years.  Ho wever, as we noted in yesterday’s Board presentation, the confidence band around our fo recast for core inflation is quite wide.  And the uncertainty surrounding that forecast has more to do with unaccounted-for shocks than it does with our uncertainty about the strength or weakness of the economy over the next two years.  Those resu lts imply both that we will almost surely be wrong and that we probably won’t be able to offer you with any confidence good explanations as to why.  Karen Johnson will now continue our presentation. 

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  As we reported in the Greenbook, the information about economic activity abroad that we have r eceived since the September FOMC meeting has confirmed our view that foreign real  GDP growth has rebounded from the weak pace of the first half of the year.  Based on various indicators from a variety of countries plus the more robust estimate for U.S. third-quarter growth than had been projected in September, we have revised up our best guess of av erage real growth abroad last quarter to 3½ percent fr om the 3 percent we had projected.  The upward revision to the GDP growth figur e for the third quarter is due in part to a recovery in some previously strong count ries that were weak earlier in the year for transitory reasons.  The primary explanation for this outcome is the SARS epidemic, and the countries in question are China and other emerging-market Asian economies.  But we have also revised up forecasts for countries such as the United Kingdom, where the most recent evidence s uggests a stronger pace to real activity than we had expected.  Looking ahead for 2004 and 2005, we see con tinued average grow th abroad at about the current pace as most likely, si milar to our September outlook although we have fiddled a bit with the projections for individual countries.  Sustained growth at 16 of 1263½ percent would be a welcome improvement  in foreign economic performance, and it would go some way to clos ing the relative growth differential between the United States and its trading partne rs.  Our baseline projection calls for that gap to narrow from over 1½ percentage points this year to  about ½ percentage point in 2005.  Such an outcome would lessen the sense that the global economy is overly dependent on the engine of U.S. growth, although I hasten to add that a surprising shortfall of U.S. growth from that projected in our base line would have negative implications for growth abroad as well.  Among the foreign industrial countries, we  expect that Canada and the United Kingdom will continue to record the most successful performance.  Domestic demand within those economies continues to be st rong, and financial markets as well as we are now expecting the Bank of England to begin raising its poli cy rate soon in response.  In our baseline forecast, growth  in the euro area firms over the next year and achieves a pace of about 2½ percent in 2005.  In contrast, we are a bit skeptical of the signs of recovery in the Japanese economy and have written down positive, but still low, real GDP growth going forward for that country.  All in all, the picture for the industrial countries  is one in which the expansion remains somewhat uneven but is shared by all the major countries.    For the developing countries, the proj ected improvement in growth over the forecast period is more dramatic, as both  the Asian and Latin American countries recover from various idiosyncratic problems this year to achieve significantly more vigorous growth next year.  We anticipate that China will continue to outperform all other countries with respect to reported real GDP grow th, although we expect the rate to moderate a bit by 2005.  Elsewhere in Asia, strength in the gl obal high-tech sector should provide support for rapid output gr owth of production that in turn will underpin incomes and domestic demand.  In Mexico, sustained expansion of output depends upon a rebound in U.S. manufacturi ng that in turn stimulates Mexican manufacturing.  In general, we see dispersion of real output growth lessening across the developing countries as global recovery  becomes more firmly established in 2004 and 2005.  Our projection that growth rates will return  toward trends in mo st countries results in part from our sense of the normal work ing of macroeconomic forces and in part from our natural reluctance to project a ny major new shocks to the global economy.  We do believe, however, that we can detect in current data the basis for such an optimistic outlook.  One shock that might be of particular interest and relevance is a more substantial development might seem a possibility in light  of the nearly 5 percent drop in the nominal value of the dollar in terms of the other majo r currencies that we have experienced during the intermeeting period.  In addition, the continued widening of U.S. trade and current account deficits, even as foreign growth recovers, might heighten concerns on the part of global investors about taking on increasing amounts 17 of 126of exposure to U.S. assets.  Accordingly, we included in the Greenbook an alternative simulation in which the real exchange va lue of the dollar declines an additional 20 percent by the end of next year.  This alternative continues to assume that China and Malaysia peg to the dollar but posits a one-time revalu ation in that peg so that these countries share in the adjustment to a weaker dollar.  Foreign monetary authorities other than those pegging are assu med to implement policies according to a Taylor rule, so that they do take steps to mitigate the consequences of exchange rate appreciation for their dome stic macroeconomic performance.  However, with the exchange rate shock phased in and the usua l lags in monetary policy effectiveness, such policy responses cannot prevent signi ficant effects on real GDP growth and inflation abroad.  As reported in the Gree nbook, the implications in the staff model of this large and rapid decline in the dollar for U.S. real GDP growth are plus ¾ percentage point in 2004 and 1½ percentage points in 2005.  Core PCE inflation is increased about 1 percentage point.  For foreign economies, our model predicts the greatest decline in growth by year-end 2005 in Canada because of its depende nce on exports to the United States.  However, in the near term, the larges t negative impacts fall on Mexico and the developing countries of Asia.  These economies are also quite open and trade-dependent.  In the simulation, the largest redu ctions in inflation also occur in Canada, Mexico, and developing Asia.  In response,  the Taylor rule calls for very large reductions in short-term interest rates by their respective officials.  Under our assumption that the shocks to exchange rates are comparable across all of these trading partners, the negative consequences for growth in the euro area and the United Kingdom are relatively mild and slow to develop.  For Japan, the option to ease rates in response to further appreci ation is not available and so the consequences for real growth are somewhat larger than in the euro  area but less than in the other regions.  This particular simulation suggests th at significant and broadly felt dollar depreciation would have its greatest effects on output in two of the regions of the global economy where performance is now strongest, Canada and emerging Asia.  Further into the future, in response to m onetary stimulus, those economies should see domestic demand offset the loss in external demand.  With J-curve effects actually increasing the nominal value of U.S. impor ts following declines in the dollar, our trade and current account balances initially worsen and then subsequently begin to adjust.  By the second half of 2005, the U.S.  trade deficit would begin to narrow.  That completes our prepared remarks.  David and I will be happy to answer your questions.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  David, I see you don’ t have an estimate for real adjusted durable goods for September yet.  Do you have a sense of the order of magnitude?  The reason I raise the issue is that the extr aordinary difference between total durable goods and real adjusted durable goods for the month of August— 18 of 126

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  We should be able to have  that calculation, I would imagine, by the coffee break or shortly after the break. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’ve found it to be a ve ry useful statistic over the years, and I’d like to get a sense of it.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  David, looking at 2004, your estimates for consumption are strikingly strong.  It would be great if the figures came out  that way.  But you estimate consumption to be as strong as it was in the late  ’90s.  You touched on your reas oning, but could you again give me your rationale for that?  I ask because your forecast  is an outlier; it’s at the upper limit of the range of forecasts. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  There are really three pr incipal reasons that we show as much strength as we do in consumption for 2004.  The mo st important is that we’re expecting a very significant improvement to occur in the labor mark et.  As has been noted a few times around this table, our forecast is that j ob gains are going to be running 350,000 plus a month in 2004.  That is going to be creating a sizable acceleration in labor and—to the extent that there has been any precautionary saving motive for the last two years— acting to restrain cons umption less.  Second, we still get additional disposable  income from the enacted tax cu ts so that more disposable income is being delivered by fiscal policy as we move into 2004.  Finally , the wealth effects, which have been a significant drag on spending over the last two years, are turning from big negatives to neutral.  For us th at is the principal reason we’re s howing a step-up in real PCE next year.  On an annual average basis we still have the saving rate rising a bi t, from 3¼ percent in 2003 to 3¾ percent in 2004.  We see some reasonable risks around that forecast.  But to the extent that you have doubts about any of those three elements in the forecast, I think you would have concerns about our consumption forecast as well. 19 of 126

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Well, I question only the third reason relating to the wealth effects.  When we had these kinds of growth rates in PCE previously, the wealth effects were much more positive.  So in my view the w ealth effects returning to neutra l—while granted they are no longer a drag—won’t produce quite the boost that might be expected.  I do agree with you on the labor forecast seems a little strong to me. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I had a question for David.  In  comparing the consensus forecast to the Greenbook forecast, the Blue Chip forecast is much  higher on inflation than you are and in fact than we are in Chicago. The Blue Chip has a much higher expected path for the nominal fed funds rate, too.  First of all, why do you think it is that the Blue Chip forecast is higher on inflation than we are?  Second, you put two al ternative scenarios in to the Greenbook—one with rising inflation expectations and one with the market-based funds path.  When I look at these two scenarios, intuitively I want to  add them together or look at them at the same time.  I was wondering if there was some interaction here that  I should be thinking of  when I look at those two scenarios. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  On your last point I th ink roughly speaking these scenarios are additive.  For most intents and purposes the m odel is reasonably linear, so I think you could probably perform the analysis that way.  As fo r your first question, I’ve been puzzled by the consensus inflation forecast as well, especially when our forecast is predicated on energy prices oil.  So if the energy price assumptions in the consensus forecast are based on those futures prices, that forecast must have a rather sh arp acceleration in underlying inflation.  One 20 of 126possibility, of course, is that the Blue Chip forecasters put a great deal more emphasis on speed effects—or the change in the unemployment rate —whereas we are still relying on the level of slack in both labor markets and product markets to  be a restraint on overall inflation.  We think the evidence supports that gap t ype effect.  But as we discusse d a little over a year ago in the special presentation to the FOMC, the Phillips curv e has gotten flat enough that we don’t derive a great deal of traction in our inflation forecast from movements in the re source and output gaps.   So I think one possibility is that there will be  some deterioration in inflation expectations if we get as much growth as we’re projecti ng and policy remains unchanged.  That’s why we included that inflation expectati ons scenario because it seemed to us the most plausible way, other than just through noise, that  we could get significantly higher core inflation next year.  On the other side of that, though, we see downside ri sks, with the level of the price markup over unit labor costs—and its mirror image in the profit shar e—having recovered quite strongly.  If these competitive pressures were to operate to bring that  back down closer to historical average levels, we see downside risks associated with this foreca st as well.  So I thi nk we’re comfortable with our forecast.  But as I noted, those confidence in tervals that we showed  at yesterday’s Board presentation suggest that nobody should hold a view on that with strong conviction. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry. MR. PARRY.  My question is related to that of President Moskow.  At the end of the forecast period, when the output gap in the baselin e is close to zero and inflation is close to 1 percent, a neutral nominal fe deral funds rate would be aroun d 3½ percent, which is about where financial markets actually expect it to be.  Isn’t that a more  reasonable baseline assumption than that of the Greenbook? 21 of 126

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I guess I’m forced to say “no”!  [Laughter]  We still think that in essence the equilibrium real funds rate is going to be below its historical average by the end of 2005.  One reason is that the level of the dollar is still relatively high despite the fact that it has come down.  Second, the investment share in GDP is still quite low relative to its historical average.  Now, as we look further beyond the en d of 2005, we do think it w ould be reasonable to expect a return of the equilibrium real funds rate back to its historical average of 2½ percent or so; we think that’s the direction you’ll be headed  toward at that point.  But we don’t see that process as occurring so rapidly th at the market’s expectation is th e one that we want to buy into for the end of 2005.  That might be the case looking down a couple more years, but not in 2005.   In part there’s another factor  that boosts the equilibrium ra te further down the road but that in the intermediate term is providing us with the capacity for noninflationary growth, and that is that we’re expecting a further acceleration in poten tial output growth sometime beyond 2005.  As the improvement in investment that we ’re forecasting occurs, it  lifts potential capital services and provides a bit more space for the ec onomy to grow.  Again, in the long run that obviously is a factor why intere st rates would need to be so mewhat higher.  But over the intermediate period it allows rates to be somewhat lower. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  It would seem to me that pe rhaps one reason the financial markets might have higher expectations with regard to inflation is that they’re looking at different models.  Those models could have expectational effects that would be quite pronounced if our exogenous assumptions about interest rates were to be incorporated. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  That’s a risk th at I think we tried to highli ght here.  Obviously that is very difficult for us to forecast.  We don’t view that as the most likely outcome in part because, with energy prices declining rapi dly, headline inflation actually is going to be quite low.  I don’t 22 of 126think that’s a situation in which we’d anticipat e that inflation expect ations would likely be building up much of a head of steam. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Dave, I have a couple of questio ns related to the la bor market and other variables.  For quite some time you’ve forecas t a very strong improvement in employment beginning relatively early next year and extending through 2005.  I assume at the end of the day that it must be intuition rather than a purely model-based result.  Do you have any anecdotes or other information that would give me greater confidence than I have at the moment that something like that result is likely?  Of course, it’s accompan ied by well below trend growth in structural productivity for that whole period. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I think that is where the rubber meets the road.  In fact, we are following our models quite closel y here, but the underlying assumpti on is that structural labor productivity is growing 2¾ percent.   If we’re wrong and it is considerably higher, then the first-round effects would be that the economy will be able to grow faster with less employment going forward.  If we’re not going to get that slowdown in productiv ity, we’re not going to get the boost to labor growth associated with that.  Th at would mean on the other side of the income statement that profits would be higher as well.  We’d probably figure that would net out to a slightly weaker economy, given that the marginal propensity to consume out of labor income is somewhat higher than that stemmi ng from capital income.  So, if we got a shift in an adverse direction for labor next year, that would probably tend to weaken our overall outlook. Now, as you know, in the last forecast r ound we revised up further our estimates of structural productivity.  We di dn’t do that this time.  We’re just weeks away from a 23 of 126comprehensive revision to the national income accounts that is going to change the last five years of history—and maybe in significant ways .  Our thought was, Let’s wait to see what happens in the comprehensive revision and then try to put it all toge ther. We got the hours revision this summer, and we’ll be getting the output revision shortly. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Well, let me pursue this one step  further.  Obviously, we can get this path of real GDP growth with almost any combinati on of hours and productivity  growth.  If we got employment gains of, say, 200,000 to 250,000 a month rather than 300,000 to 340,000 a month going forward and the difference was made up by pr oductivity, to what extent would that mix give you a different inflation for ecast?  I don’t know th e interworkings of your model that well, but I assume it would give you even lower inflation in a more or less base case environment than the scenario you presented. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  It would indeed.  It would give that lower inflat ion through its effects on the aggregate amount of slack.  There would be less employment and, therefore, a greater amount of slack in the labor market.  If it were also a reflection of an underlying improvement in structural labor productivity growth  that was greater than we thought , that too would be relieving cost pressures even more than  we are currently estimating. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  It would give us deflation? MR. STOCKTON.  As we showed yesterday, inflation is so slightly above our estimate of measurement bias there, it wouldn’t take much  to do that.  Now, on the anecdotal side, as I’ve indicated, we’ve seen a few tentative signs that some improvement may be under way.  This is the first time we’ve revised up our employment— 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Well, I think some improveme nt is under way.  I question whether it’s going to reach the magnitudes you have projected in the Greenbook.  24 of 126

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  One change we did make was to trim some of the strength we had in first-quarter employment because we didn’t see enough in the forward-looking indicators to provide us with confidence on that.  We trim med some in Q1 and have stronger employment growth for the remainder of next year.  It’s a forecast. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Okay. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  I had the same question about the degree of diffe rence between this forecast and ones we see from major outside fore casters.  At our Bank we usually construct a little chart that plots the Greenbook forecast relative to other for ecasts.  We have the respective forecasts for real GDP on the x axis and the change in the CPI or  some other measure of inflation on the y axis.  Normally, the Greenbook is somewhere in the middle, but now it is clearly an outlier for any quarter one looks  at.  It’s in the bottom right -hand quadrant, with high GDP growth and very low rates of infl ation.  If we do a similar compar ison with respect to changes in the fed funds rate, we see very big differences as well.  That’s also true if one goes deeper into the forecast details and looks at wh at outsiders think the gap is ve rsus what the staff believes.  Even forecasts that have a higher gap—through 2004 anyway—still show rising rates of inflation and rising fed funds rates.  So it seems that the co nstruct you are using is r eally different from the vast majority of other forecasters.  That could m ean that you’re right.  But it also puts us in the unusual position of being the optimistic central bank.   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  At least the optimistic staff of the central bank!  [Laughter]  I leave it to you to decide how optimistic you wish to be.  Y ou’re right—our forecast is an outlier.  We really struggled with that  in the sense that if we were to be less optimistic about the aggregate supply side of our projection, we  would be showing even greater employment growth than we 25 of 126already are showing.  I th ink we’d have a hard time explaini ng how the level of productivity had gotten quite so high.  We already have it subs tantially above our estimate of structural productivity growth.  Our interpretation of the strong employment gains that we’re showing is that a lot of what we’ve seen has been cyclical.  So we’re getting pulled in both these directions on the productivity side.  The productivity and the employment data would tend to make us want to be more optimistic.  If we were more optimis tic, we’d be showing even lower inflation than we’re showing, and that would push us further away from the consensus in that direction. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  The other question I wanted to raise relates to a statement by one contact—one of what seems like a zillion I’ve talked with over the last four or five weeks—who likened the uptick in consumption over the summer to a sugar high associated with the greater fiscal stimulus.  We’re a little more downbeat in New England than nearly everybody else, as everyone could see from the Beige Book, and maybe th at’s just a reflection of our environment.  I don’t know.  You did mention, however, a few thi ngs that seemed to be coming in a bit on the weaker side in September and earl y October.  I must say that, in  talking with the people from First Call, while the profit numbers have been ex ceeding analysts’ expectations, there seem to be a number of warnings that it is not going to co ntinue and some concerns expressed about that.  

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I think that’s clearly a downside risk.  Again, our forecast is predicated on the notion that th e spending pattern this summer wa sn’t fully a sugar high related to the fiscal stimulus.  We believe that the overall environment for consumer spending—with some improvement in balance sheets, some step-up in sentiment since the spring, and low interest rates—is providing support to consumption.  We couldn’t see attri buting all of the higher spending just to the tax effect.  But to the extent  that one might be looking at the high-frequency 26 of 126indicators, I think the recent re adings would give one at least a little concern about our forecast that consumption will remain as strong as we ha ve projected.  Now, our PCE forecast drops off to less than 2 percent in the fourth quarter, so we have assumed that there’s going to be some payback—part of it related to motor vehicles—for a lot of the streng th that we saw earlier.  Here again we were balancing the possibility that the data may be signaling greater underlying momentum than we are allowing for versus the po ssibility that more of this has just been a temporary pulling forward of purchases.  Whether we got that balance righ t or not, I don’t know.  As I indicated, trying to pin down the tax effects is mostly guesswor k.  We really don’t have very much in the way of hard empirical  evidence to base those calculat ions on.  So to me that says that the uncertainty about consumption for the next few months is es pecially large.  The confidence interval is always wide, but I think in this period it’s even wider than usual because we have to contend with trying to interpret something about wh ich there is a great deal of uncertainty. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Dave, on the monetary aggregates—both M2 and MZM show no net growth over the last three months, and bank credit has actually declin ed a bit.  Is there a story or anything interesting behind those observations?   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I’ll let Vincent speak to th e monetary aggregates , but in terms of short-term borrowing, businesses did a whole lo t of borrowing in the second quarter in the environment of very low interest rates.  They  built up their liquid asse ts and solidified their balance sheets quite significan tly.  Corporate cash flow and in ternal funds have been going gangbusters recently, and it is still the case with respect to demands for short-term credit—for example, inventory investment—that firms are con tinuing to liquidate inve ntories.  So we put 27 of 126those things together and we’re not reading from the recent drop-off in business borrowing a signal of impending weakness.  I don’t know, Vin cent, if you have any words you want to say about this. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  With regard to  C&I loans, I would note that in the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, banks reported that dema nd had been weak over the last three months.  That is consistent with declining inventories, although the answers to more forward-looking questions provided a little glimmer of hope in that  regard.  As for the monetary aggregates, we believe that the slowdown in mortgage refi nancing has pulled down liquid deposits to a considerable degree.  We suspect  that it actually pulled down M2 growth in particular—more so than we’d previously been allowing for using our  rules of thumb—and we were working in that direction.  Depending on the assumptions one makes with regard to timing—in terms of how long the deposits sit there—much of the slowdown could be account ed for by refinancing effects. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  I, too, was struggling with  the staff’s inflation forecast and had noticed what Cathy Minehan talked about in connection with the Green book relative to other forecasts.  It started me thinking about what I’ll call the integrity of our forecasting processes in a changing environment.  We know our model has l ong adjustment and distributed lags to policy, and we’re estimating the relevant variables ove r a period of time when we haven’t had as stimulative a monetary policy as we have now.  I wonder whether or not others are adjusting their forecasts to react to that and whether our inability, or our unwillingness, to do so is leading us to a result that looks the way it does, as we’ve di scussed at this table.  In essence, I’m a little concerned that this may involve a regime change  in the Lucas sense and each of the forecasting 28 of 126models is trying to play with how  to adjust to the data in their forecasts.  Can you give me any comfort that these long lags are appropriate ly adjusted? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  May I just add to that?  You emphasized before that we’re dealing with a linear model.  How many observati ons do we have that i ndicate that, as the inflation rate moves down, the marginal change s in the gap are indeed linear?  Or are we possibly looking at a situation in which the m odel works fine with an inflation rate over 2 percent and, indeed, is linea r up to 11 percent or somethi ng like that but the number of observations we have below 2 percent is really quite small?  I was curious whether or not you have any sense as to whether we’re  dealing with a different regime in the same sense as when a particle approaches the speed of light its characteristics change.  Now, I scarcely want to draw that as an analogy to your model, but there are such regimes, and basically I suspect that a problem like that may be involved here.   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I suggest that comparing the Board’s bureaucracy to something that would move at the speed of light is pushing th at analogy!  [Laughter]  First, I think you’re obviously right.  Any time you’re using a model es timated with historical data to forecast a future period with events that are toward or  outside the limit of what you’ve estimated your model on, you have to believe that there’s goin g to be some wider confidence interval around that forecast.  We have never been able to  find, and we have looked for it, evidence of nonlinearity in the gap term or of  what people used to call “goal line effects”—evidence that the influence of the gap might become smaller the cl oser we get to price stability.  The data don’t seem to support that very strongly. The question that President Santomero has raised is certainly one that we have been concerned about because of the possibility that ou r model may not be able to pick up that kind of 29 of 126regime shift.  I think the alternative simulation that we did—where we le t inflation expectations in a sense become unglued from what our model would expect—does try to highlight for you what we think the potential consequences of that  risk would be.  As I indicated, there are a couple of reasons why we don’t view that as the be st baseline expectation.  One is that we think headline inflation is going to be  quite well behaved when energy prices start to come down.  That’s certainly going to help.  It’s also the case th at, if we’re right at leas t in the first half of next year, let’s say, markets are going to be able to see that, even though there’s not going to be a change in monetary policy, you’re also not thro wing in the towel on containing inflation.  Actual inflation will be coming in quite low, if our forecast is correct, so your be havior in fact will be consistent with expectations about your objectives.  To a large degree that  is the way we would provide some rationale for our baseline assumption.  Obviously, if we get rapid growth and a string of unattractive inflation num bers, the risk would start to rise that people would wonder whether or not you were giving in on your inflation objective.   We see that as a potential risk if don’t do anything for a considerable  period of time on the monetary  policy front.  On the other hand, they will be seeing core inflation figures, if we’re right, that look very good and headline inflation figures that look extremely good.  So they’re not necessarily going to see a compelling requirement for you to have to adjust policy.  They  might, in fact, be quite  comfortable with that outcome. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  David, do you think that the revisions in the NIPA data could significantly alter our view  about some of the key relations hips we’re now taking as being fitted with some robustness?  The BEA doesn’t have new data on the most recent periods, does it? 30 of 126

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Well, I have a hard time im agining that the NIPA revisions are going to alter the output and inflati on nexus fundamentally.  The unemployment rate is not going to be affected at all by this, of course.  The price figures, although they get revised, tend not to be revised dramatically or persiste ntly enough for the relationships in our inflation equations to change.  One area in which we could see change s big enough to affect underlying parameters in the model might be investment spending.  For ex ample, if there’s a si gnificant revision in software investment—we saw one the last time there was a NIPA revisi on—that could influence our thinking about what is happeni ng with the long-run share of so ftware investment relative to overall output. That in turn could affect our  potential GDP forecast and our view of what investment spending is likely to be over the next  few quarters.  Similarly, if we get big revisions on the income side, that could alter the saving ra te enough perhaps to change our view about the sensitivity of consumer spending and saving to wealth.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Isn’t the latter the most likely problem because that figure is a residual and often ha s been revised far more substantially  than the other elements of the system?  

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  We’ve had very big revisi ons on the income side, some of them flowing through quite often into the saving rate.  So I think that is  a real possibility.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who would like to start off the Committee’s discussion?  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

 MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ec onomic activity in the Seventh District continued to improve in September and October, although we still appear to be lagging national trends.  Our business contacts, including those a ttending our recent advisory council meeting, are increasingly optimistic, though they’re not breaking out the champagne just yet.  Once again, 31 of 126much of the region’s strength derives from house hold spending.  Home sales remain very robust, and retail sales picked up further in recent weeks.  Retailers al so are more optimistic about the holiday season.  We’re hearing mixed signals regarding invent ories.  Some retailers are concerned that they may lose sales unless they replenish inventories, but many are still cautious and say that they plan to  keep their stocks lean. As you know, light vehicle sales have softened  since August but were  still running above year-ago levels in September and October.  Our Big Three contacts expect fourth-quarter light vehicle sales to be around 16¾ million units—that’ s above their estimate of just a few months ago—and they forecast similar sales for 2004.  So  to use David’s terminology, the outlook for sales is somewhere between spectacular and real ly good.  One of the Big Three firms has raised its fourth-quarter production plan s a bit; roughly half the increase,  however, is a catch-up from output lost during the August power blackout.  Sa les incentives are still very high, but they’ve leveled off.   Business spending also picked up modestly.  Our contacts suggest that retailers are spending more on remodeling and re novating their stores this year than last year.  Manufacturers report a more broad-based improvement in demand for capital goods, though much of the spending is still for repair, maintenance, and replacement of existing equipment.  We’ll see another strong Chicago Purchasing Ma nagers’ index when the data are released this Friday.  The index moved up from 51.2 in September to 55 in October, marking the sixth consecutive month that it was above 50.  Moreover, the employment  component was also above 50 for the second time in three months.  Obviously these numbers are confidential until Friday, when they are made public. 32 of 126On the temporary help front, both of the larg e firms we speak to are now seeing strong growth in orders—beyond the typical seasonal pickup.  Average hours per assignment in one firm are at a record high, and th at company is seeing some forwar d-looking orders for the first time in many months.  Both firms are now confiden t that a robust recovery in temporary help is under way and that we should start to see a pick up in permanent hiring soon.  That said, most firms in our District remain cau tious about hiring, but that is a long-running story.  Employment in our District is down 4 percent since its peak, compared with a d ecline of 2 percent for the total economy.   Turning to the national outlook, the data receive d since our last meeting have been quite encouraging on balance, as we’ve discussed befo re.  No doubt tax cuts explain most of the improvement in real disposable income last qua rter, which in turn help ed to produce the strong growth in consumer spending.  But tax cuts are not the whole stor y.  Underlying household demand appears solid.  With business confiden ce improving, we should see some inventory rebuilding and further gains in capital spending.  So output growth is likely to remain above potential until next year.  This should finally translate into a meaningful recovery in labor such a recovery.  In the meantime, the odds are th at core inflation will co me down a bit further, but the chances of a really unwelcome disinflation are becoming more remote.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry. MR. PARRY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent economic growth in the Twelfth District appears to have kept up with the nationa l pace.  In fact, Nevada and Hawaii have grown quite rapidly with a boost from strong tourist trade.  Arizona also has had relatively strong growth, though our contacts tell us that this co mes in part at the expense of California.  33 of 126Throughout the District our  contacts have noted more cases  of employees working longer hours and of plans to add positions in coming months.  However, it is also clear that firms are continuing efforts to increase efficiency.  Manufact urers in the District ar e reporting increases in orders.  The demand for building materials in the Northwest has been growing.  On the technology front, most IT producers are reporting improved business conditions.  It is also encouraging that R&D spending by IT and biotech firms generally has held up relatively well in the downturn.   With business conditions firming, office v acancy rates edged down recently in San Francisco and Seattle, two areas that have been hit hard.  The housing market in the District remains strong, especially in the Phoenix area.  In California much attention is on how the governor-elect, Arnold Schwarzenegger,  will deal with the state’s fi scal situation.  For example, the budget agreement worked out last August left the state with a struct ural budget shortfall of about $8 billion for future fiscal years.  Ev en more pressing, though, are the cracks forming in the state’s budget agreement for the current fiscal  year.  In September the courts disallowed the sale of $2 billion in pension bonds the state planned to use to make payments to its retirement fund.  More recently, a suit was filed challenging  the legality of a proposed bond sale of $10.7 billion to pay off the short-term debt supporting current spending.  Also thrown into the equation is the governor-elect’s vow to reduce the car registration tax by $4 billion—which, of course, would be a direct hit to state revenues.  One pl an put forth by the Schwarzenegger team to meet funding needs is to issue about $20 billion in lo ng-term general obligation bonds.  This was not well received in Sacramento or by the rating agencies.  The real ity, though, is that without new debt of some kind the state will be in a cash flow crisis come next June. 34 of 126Once again we’ve been pleasantly surprised by the recent data on the national economy.  As a result, we, too, have raised our estimate of  how fast the economy is likely to grow in the near term.  We now expect real GDP to grow at a pace close to 5 percent in the second half of this year and in 2004, which is really not that different from the Greenbook forecast.  However, we have a less accommodative path for monetary  policy that is much closer to market expectations.  Output is expected to grow noticeably faster than its potential rate ne xt year and to continue to grow somewhat above  potential the year after that , but the economy does not reach full employment until the second half of 2005.  So inflation is expected to remain around current low levels.  Although these low levels of inflatio n imply that disinflationa ry shocks could still impose substantial costs upon the economy, recent data  suggest that the risk s are not as large as before.  In fact, recent developments such as  the lower dollar have caused us to raise our inflation forecast slightly.  To me this suggests that it may be time to consider modifying the risk-assessment statement to indica te that the risks to the inflat ion outlook are at least close to being balanced.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  First Vice President Stewart. 

[SECTION]

MR. STEWART.  By most measures the Sec ond District economy appears to be on the rebound in absolute terms and particularly relati ve to the nation as w hole.  Private-sector employment has trended up in New Jersey but has held near its cyclical low in New York.  Our Empire State manufacturing survey, which had been signaling steady growth in the second and third quarters, kicked into a higher gear in October, suggesting accelerating activity and even some pickup in employment.  This is consiste nt with a recent upturn in jobs in hard-hit manufacturing areas of upstate New York such as Rochester.  Housing markets in and around New York City sustained strong forward moment um in the third quart er, with brisk sales 35 of 126activity, a diminishing inventory of homes for sale, and continued price appreciation.  New construction has also remained robust.  Re flecting a combination of general economic improvement and recent increases in tax rates, Ne w York State, New York City, and New Jersey all reported a continued pickup in tax revenues in the third quarter.   On the national side, the upsurge in recen t activity is clearly welcome.  Production appears to be ramping up to catch up to househ old spending, and there are signs that capital spending is coming back to life.  Business confid ence is firming, with the pickup in growth and the pronounced turnaround in  profits.  The labor market looks a bit better.  I don’t think much should be made of the small increase in jobs la st month.  The figure for September was a little above zero after a string of number s slightly below zero.  Still, it was good to see, and there are indications of some follow-thr ough:  Unemployment claims have fallen a bit, business surveys are showing stronger hiring plans, and we are he aring about firms actively seeking workers.   Looking ahead, I believe that the recovery will  be subdued and that inflation will remain under control for a considerable period.  Businesses  will continue to meet increased demand with an improved management model, which will lim it the need for significantly more plant, inventory, or employees.  Capacity will continue to  grow rapidly in China and India, which will limit pricing power for U.S. producers.  Busine ss people are concerned about the long-term implications of our large fiscal deficit and the current account deficit.  There’s a general belief that we are living beyond our means in this coun try and that the price will be paid after the current stimulative boom runs its course.  One facet of this concern is our global competitiveness.  We have been able to move into higher-value activities in the past when manufacturing jobs moved offshore.  But today we see that some developing countries have 36 of 126large pools of well-educated and inexpensive workers that are beginning to challenge our position in areas such as technology.   My assumption is that the relationship between economic recovery and business 1992 recovery, when employment gains were very la te and moderate.  I believe that in this recovery we will see businesses doing very well in terms of sales, profits, and cash flow but that it will not translate into the same level of hiring and plant expansion that we expected in the past.  Instead it will show up in larger dividends and continued pressure for more productivity from existing people and equipment.  Any new cap acity expansion will be done offshore when possible.  Given this outlook, I believe that mone tary policy will be stable for quite some time, and in my view our statement should continue to communicate that message.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You may have seen several weeks ago a Wall Street Journal article on the transportation industry.  Gi ven that several major transportation companies are located in the Ei ghth District, I thought I would comment on that industry.  My FedEx contact said that he was not as bullish about the outlook as the view conveyed in the Wall Street Journal  article.  He said, in particular, that the higher-value business—the more expensive goods that are often shipped by air—does not seem  to be coming back though the lower-value ground business is rebounding more quickly.  He pr ovided some data on the ground business that show fairly striking increases in growth.  In the middle of this year, th e ground business at FedEx was about 1 percent above year-ago levels, a nd it’s now running in the neighborhood of 6 to 7 percent ahead of last year’s fi gures.  Moreover, my contact indi cated that FedEx is expecting in the first half of 2004 year-over-year increases in the 10 percent range.  He says he is much more 37 of 126confident about growth than he has been for some time.  It’s not that the expected growth is all that high but that it seems a good b it more certain that a solid rec overy is under way.  He expects the growth in express business—air shipment onl y—to increase from the current 1 to 2 percent on a year-over-year basis to about 4 to 5 percent by next spring.  So he anticipates a pickup in that segment of the business as well.   FedEx had a five-year expansion plan to doubl e its ground capacity.  UPS, of course, is the major company in that business, but FedEx has been catching up in recent years.  FedEx officials had been discussing deferring some of that capacity increase but  have now decided to proceed with their aggressive expansion plan.  Business is continuing to shift from express to ground.  That’s a consequence of the push toward lo wer-cost shipments but also reflects the fact that the speed of ground delivery has improved.  Th at is, the features of  the ground network have been improved, and packages can be delivered more  quickly than before.  So in terms of speed, it’s more competitive with the delivery schedules th at have been available in air shipments for a long time.  The weakest part of the business is in outbound express from the United States.  FedEx continues to have a big imbalance of ship ments, with much more volume coming in than going out. The firm sees the international situatio n as quite strong, especially in Asia including Japan.  In fact, the situation in  Japan is looking much better .  Business is lagging in Latin America, however, and is hurting in Europe prim arily because of slow growth in Germany.  As for the labor situation, Fed Ex has very low—in  fact record low—tur nover in its employment force, particularly among lower-skilled workers, such as package handlers.  The company sees no wage pressures in either the lowe r-skilled or the more-skilled levels of its staff.  In the latter category, for example, a lot of pilots are available.   38 of 126My UPS contact said that, for the first time in well over two years, they are seeing strong growth as they go into the fourth quarter, which of course is  the big holiday season—growth that will exceed the expectations they had earlier in th e year.  He anticipates that the fourth quarter will be very, very strong.  UPS reports that co mputer companies are increasing their shipments and that shipping for the mail order business is st rong.  My contact pointed out, however, that the UPS numbers are somewhat affected by the fact that shippers signed a lot of contracts in 1997 right after a strike, so as those contracts now roll over, UPS is picking up some of that business again.  The company’s numbers look a little stro nger as a consequence.  The cargo industry in general is very busy, partly because of military lifts to Iraq, but my contact indicated that the military business is not the whole story at all.   Let me turn to the trucking industry.  My c ontact at J.B. Hunt said that from his perspective the Wall Street Journal article substantially overstated the strength in the transportation industry.  My Hunt contact has not seen a major tu rnaround in any area of Hunt’s business.  The freight business is a little stronger than last year, register ing an increase of about 3½ percent in volume.  Their in termodal business—the piggyback or rail–truck combination—is much stronger now on a year-over-y ear-basis, but that reflects the f act that the West Coast ports were shut down a year ago.  Moreover, ba sed on what he knows about the situation among competitors, he sees no indication of a surge anywhere in the trucking industry.  Some stories of tightness in that market might be coming along, however, as a consequence of the reduction in capacity.  A lot of trucking companies have gone under, and drivers continue to be in tight supply.  He noted also that, on January 4, new rule s for drivers go into e ffect that increase the required rest periods or reduce the maximum number of hours of driving.  He saw one calculation that these changes will require 84,000  new drivers nationall y.  Apparently there 39 of 126aren’t that many drivers around ready to be picked up.  So if that number is correct, we might see at least some temporary disruption until some of us decide to seek a more lucrative occupation!  [Laughter]  The old rules that are being cha nged, by the way, have been in place since 1939.   I might share an observation from a member of our board about a company named Kimball International.  What I remember about Kimball is that it used to make pianos, but apparently it now manufactures high-end office furn iture.  He said that Kimball has experienced a surge in orders for office furniture in just the past four weeks.  Orders were “picking up at a rapid pace” is the way he put it.  I thought that was an interesting piece of information. I recently talked with my Wal-Mart cont act—at the end yesterda y afternoon actually—and he said that September sales had been a litt le stronger than expecte d.  Wal-Mart had been anticipating a year-over-year increase  in same-store sales of 3 to 5 percent, and it came in at 5.6 percent.  He pointed out, t hough, that the weather had been unusually good in September.  He said that retailers often use weather as an excuse to explain low sales, but he was citing weather as the reason that Wal-Mart had a better perf ormance than had been anticipated.  September came in somewhat below August, however; but as I think I mentioned last time, August sales had been significantly stronger than anticipated because of the large volume of clearance goods. For October, Wal-Mart had been expecting an increase of 3 to 5 percent in same-store sales, and to date—as of yest erday afternoon—sales for the mont h were up about 4.7 percent.  He noted that two-thirds of the sales gain is coming from increased traffic rather than the average size of the sales ticket.  My contact views that as just an indication th at Wal-Mart is taking customers from its competitors.  He continues to  see evidence of significan t liquidity pressures in the household sector.  For example, a predominan ce of items in the shopping basket continues to be concentrated at the openi ng price point of various product lines.  Moreover, the midmonth 40 of 126paycheck cycle that I’ve talked about before is still evident and in fact is more pronounced than at any time in the last three to five years.  People are shopping when they get their paychecks, and that’s true even for purchases of food and pha rmaceuticals.  So Wal-Mart  interprets its data as an indication that households remain liquidity constrained.   My contact believes that there has been some improvement but that it is “stalled” at an increase in growth of about 50 to 80 basis points.   He does not see sales growth getting better and better week by week.  There had been a pickup around the middle of the year or sometime in pretty good shape.  Some items are a bit unders tocked and some a b it overstocked; apparel particularly was a little on the high side.  Bu t inventories overall for Wal-Mart are close to desired levels.  As for the outlook, compared with some other firms whose views he was aware of, he thought Wal-Mart was among the most optim istic and had the most solid commitment to continuing capital expansion.  At a lot of other companies that he was familiar with, plans were on hold and there were no anticipated increases in  capacity at all.  The only capital spending occurring or in prospect was directed towa rd productivity improvement and not capacity expansion.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. MR. MCTEER.  Bill was talking about life in th e trucking industry.  There’s a fine song that describes that.  It says, “Pet er built a truck for a man to driv e.  It’s a pretty good livin’ but it ain’t no life.”  [Laughter]  It appears that the tide has turned somewhat  in the Eleventh District.  The tentative recovery, which was characterized by a few fa lse starts, now seems to be a full-fledged expansion.  In the third quarter, employment growth turned in its best performance in three years, 41 of 126and job growth was broad-based with most industr ies stable or growing.  Our help-wanted index also was up strongly in September, signaling a return to a hiring mode among some employers.  Texas personal income growth, after lagging the nation for two years, surp assed the national rate of income growth during the first and second quart ers of this year.  The housing boom continues, with record sales; exports are growing again; the energy sector is benefiting from higher prices; and job losses in manufacturing are slowing dow n.  The weakness of the Mexican peso and the pickup in U.S. industrial production are boosting the maquiladora outlook, and observers on the border say that help-wanted banne rs are hanging outside of maqu iladora plants for the first time in three years.  However, I must say that I attended a maquiladora convention in Mexico a couple of weeks ago, and the people in those companies are obsessed with China.  As one fellow put it to me, he’s mad at the United States for letting China get so far ahead!   Orders for goods to rebuild Iraq are coming in  fairly strongly.  A large fraction of our near-term production of plywood a nd oil field equipment is repor tedly going toward satisfying the government’s efforts to rebuild Iraq.  To su m up, we haven’t been this optimistic about the Eleventh District outlook in a l ong time.  I must qualify that just  a little though.  I’ve had several breakfasts with CEOs in an effort to get their vi ews, and they still are very hesitant to sound all that optimistic. They have some issues on their minds that temper their optimism.  They worry a lot about the costs of health ca re and pension plans, and they couldn’t emphasize enough that a lot of the expansion that will be coming along will  occur in other countries rather than in the United States.  That’s something they’re talk ing about doing themselves; it’s not that somebody else is doing it. Turning to the national economy, it’s becoming increasingly apparent that the tide has turned as well.  I concur with the broad out lines of the Greenbook forecast.  Growth has 42 of 126accelerated and likely will remain robust into 2005.  The international outlook has improved considerably.  I’m optimistic that  inflationary pressures will rema in subdued over the next year.  Everybody mentions the remaining slack in the ec onomy.  I always want to add that the very rapid productivity growth that has accompanied that slack is  a reason to be optimistic on inflation.  I’m a little less conf ident about inflation as we get into 2005, however.  As recently as last May and June many of us were publicly expressing our concerns about the potential for deflation.  In that environment it made sense fo r us to commit to maintaining a very low fed funds rate for a “considerable period.”  As the ti de shifts, the need for a clearly articulated exit strategy from that commitment is becoming increas ingly important.  Our immediate concern is to convey that at some point we will merely be taki ng our foot off the acceler ator without that being interpreted as an indication that we’re moving the foot over to the brake pedal.  These dilemmas reinforce my belief that in our pre ss releases less is more.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ec onomic conditions in New England have neither deteriorated nor improved very much since our last mee ting, at least as far as we can tell.  The intermeeting interval has been a rather busy period of regional outreach for us.  In addition to the Beige Book survey, we’ve had meetings of our academic and small business councils.  We’ve also had several bankers’ forums, a gathering of local software executives, and a wide range of conversations with business leaders.  There are clearly some positive notes in the reports from these contacts. Chipmakers and storage equi pment manufacturers are incr easing production and even are hiring.  Our UPS contact for the New England area sees an uptrend in the firm’s domestic business.  But on balance the overall tone is a bit flat or even downbeat from where it was in the 43 of 126summer.  Businesses are working hard to mainta in margins and are looking forward to spending more and to hiring locally as well as outsourcing.   But the point at which a majority will feel comfortable doing so doesn’t seem to be here yet. Regional employment levels declined in Sept ember, with a decrease compared with a year ago of around 1 percent, and that’s a good deal more than the small, 0.3 percent, decline for the nation as a whole.  Manufacturing has about 12 percent of overall jobs, but that sector represented about 50 percent of th e job losses over the past twel ve months, with the remainder primarily in the construction and th e information technology industries.  As most of you have seen, our  Beige Book contacts in manuf acturing seemed a bit out of step with others in the nation in  reporting flat or de teriorating demand.  That was due in part to the fact that a few of our cont acts were unavailable or much less communicative than usual given the proximity of Q3 earnings repo rts.  Had the full group been re flected in our report, it likely would have noted flat or slightly rising dema nd and revenues but would have sounded a similar note of caution.  Companies in the life sciences area have seen good growth in the third quarter, and defense department spending has proven beneficial to some other firms.  But the region’s largest manufacturers and a range of smaller indu stries do not expect much of a boost from the economy in coming quarters.  Most have cut em ployment, plan to continue doing so, and are currently outsourcing production to  foreign countries. Those e xpecting improvement in their businesses are depending on product innovation, in creasing market share by acquisitions, and a continuing keen focus on cost control. The region’s small and medium-size banks remain in good shape financially, with good asset quality, strong capital  ratios, and very little in the wa y of delinquencies or chargeoffs.  Their major complaint involves a drop in refinancing business and very tight margins.  44 of 126Residential real estate markets remain str ong in the region, with robust demand, somewhat slower sales growth, and steady home construc tion.  Depending on the bank and the area, small business borrowing is reported to  be either flat or slowly improving, though many bankers note that the improvements they see mainly involve firms leaving larger companies or sometimes newly merged institutions.  In those cases, the size of the larg er institution has made it less willing to meet the demands of smaller businesses. Software firms report some signs of growt h, though there’s a lot of variation in how companies are doing depending on their areas of specialization.  Some—for example, those involved in portal applications, which enable easy use of data  storage and multiple legacy systems—report record growth.  Others involved  in areas that were overbought in the ’90s continue to see problems in term s of their revenues, though the latt er are perhaps at a point of bottoming out.  Tech firms report that access to cap ital markets is varied as well.  Money is available in equity markets and from venture cap italists, but revenue prospects and stability have to be very solid.  Cost control is seen as a cr itical element for these companies, and they find advantages in using overseas labor, particularly  in India, China, and Russia.  Reportedly the outsourced software work tends to be the more r outine tasks, with higher-level jobs remaining in New England. Finally, commercial real estate markets coul d be stabilizing a bit.  CB Richard Ellis reports an increased number of tenants looking for space in the market.  Indeed, we at the Bank have seen an increase in the number of calls about and walk-throughs of our available space.  However, most of these prospect ive tenants have a number of prope rties to choose from.  Indeed, regionwide the availability of o ffice space increased a bit from the second to the third quarter, 45 of 126and per-square-foot asking prices declined slightly.  But overall th e picture looks a little better than it did.   In sum, the recovery in the region seems to be muddling along.  Th ings looked brighter earlier in the third quarter and a bit less so as September wore on.  Employment is a real concern in the region.  Consumer conf idence about the present situa tion has softened, and business confidence has stayed barely positiv e.  Hope for stronger growth remains, but there is a sense of underlying concern that real improvement  is taking too long to materialize. Turning to the nation, clearly the incoming data on the third quarter have been stronger than expected.  Consumer and business spendi ng has accelerated, driven in large part by the additions to disposable personal income from tax cu ts and child tax credits and the availability of partial tax expensing for equipment.  Profit margin s overall appear to have held up well, at least in part because of favorable cu rrency translations.  Business sp ending on equipment and software began to accelerate, too, and likely will continue  to grow, though at what pace it’s hard to determine.  Profit growth ought to lead to hiring as well; but that hasn’t happened much yet, and labor markets remain soft.  Financial markets have strengthened, and credit spreads have become more accommodative.  Inventories have been drawn down, auguring well for some impetus to Q4 growth; and the declining dollar, assuming that  the decline continues to be orderly, augurs favorably for some net export support in the curren t quarter as well.  Moreover, the outlook isn’t quite as gloomy on the external side, particul arly in non-Japan Asia, the United Kingdom, and Canada.  But the question remains as to whether th e growth we are seeing is self-sustaining.  The answer to that has to center on whether or not we  will see job creation sufficient to begin to close the output gap.   46 of 126We talked a lot before, and I won’t go into it further, about the optimistic outlook in the Greenbook for GDP, unemployment, and inflation—at  least relative to other forecasters.  President Stern mentioned the job growth figures .  The Greenbook is projecting an increase of 8 million jobs over 2004 and 2005.  In a typical recovery that amount of job growth would occur over a four-year period rather than in two years.  Normally we s ee a jump in job growth as the recovery begins; we haven’t seen that this tim e.  But in the Greenbook forecast, the job growth projected for 2004 and 2005 will make up the shortf all we’ve had in this jobless recovery and take about half the time.  That’s  a lot of jobs in a short period of time.  We in Boston don’t see the same pace of GDP growth in 2004 that the Bo ard staff projects.  Our estimate is in the upper 3s, with a small downtick in unemployment and a flat price trend.  There are upside risks—others have mentioned them—especially if we turn out to be more optimistic about the underlying inflation process than  is warranted.  In a way, se eing risks on both sides of the Greenbook forecast gives me a bit of reassurance,  though I believe that the potential downside developments, if realized, would be a bit more costly and problematic—at least in terms of the initial effects—than those on the upside.  Fo r now I would advocate no change in our policy position, and I would hope as little ch ange as possible in what we say about it.  But I’ll say more about communication later when, I assume, we  will take up that subject separately.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  La st meeting I reported that economic activity in our Southeast region was showing tangible signs of forward momentum.  That has 47 of 126continued into October.  The retail sector remains reasonably strong, with some reports of increased sales of high-end merchandise, and our contacts are op timistic about the holiday sales prospects.  Single-family housing markets acro ss our region have retain ed their strength, and vacancy rates in the multifamily sector have decl ined.  Our commercial real estate markets have not yet turned around, though there were several interesting reports from our bankers about financing being sought for new projects.  Our important hospitality and tourism sector has continued to improve, as hotel occupancy incr eased, restaurant business was generally good, and the number of European visitors in Florida rose because of an appreciating euro.  Manufacturing remains mixed, though with growing signs of more stability.  We hear mo re reports of spending to replace equipment.  And somewhat different from Bill Poole’s report, our trucking contacts indicate that there has been increased activity in recent weeks.  The outlook for increases in hiring continues to be the most difficult to judge.  Businesses are telling us that they remain reluctant to hire permanent workers, opting inst ead to use overtime or part-time and contract help.  That said, overall employme nt in our District now appears to be growing at a moderate pace.  Prices remain stable, although one of my directors in the utility business continues to encourage us to think through the implications of  potentially higher natural gas prices over the winter and what that may mean for production costs. Turning to the national outlook, the expansion appears to be on trac k.  I would use the same words that others have in describing the mo st recent data as encouraging.  The expansion seems to be getting stronger legs and appears to have more breadth.  Productivity is strong.  Capital spending is beginning to show traction in the construction, manufacturing, wholesale, and professional services sectors.  The internat ional outlook has been revi sed up in the last two 48 of 126Greenbooks.  Recent data even suggest that the heretofore disappointing jobs picture may be stabilizing or improving, although it’s probably too soon to generalize there. At the same time, we still are hearing expr essions of caution from both large and small businesses, and a significant amount of restructur ing and retrenchment is continuing in at least some industries.  Inventory accumulation remain s another question mark.  Business inventories continue to run down, and I read the reports from  a recent NFIB survey as suggesting that small businesses at least won’t be adding to inventories quite yet.  So the timing and the size of the expected inventory pickup is st ill not clear.  Taken together, these developments on the national front, reinforced by the continuing improvements we’re seeing in our region, give me growing confidence that a more broadly based expansion is now in process and is likely to continue.   I want to look ahead just a bit, and with c onsiderable restraint, to the discussion on policy and communication since it’s especially hard fo r me to sense how that discussion might be structured today.  Although I think policy is calibrated about ri ght as we try to nurture the developing expansion, I believe we need to be especially cautious today about how much we tinker with the wording of our announcement lest we interject new uncertainty and controversy about the future path of policy.  There probably is room to modify our words at the margin—to convey growing confidence about the sustainability of the expansion and perh aps try to clarify or condition our currently unconditional commitment to maintain an accommodative policy for a considerable period.  But the ideas left on the table from our discussion last month and the additional ideas that have been put forward since then lead me to strongly favor taking some time to think through the very complicated and importa nt issues that have been raised.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, the Tenth Dist rict economy continues to improve, and our business contacts have become somewhat more optim istic about the outlook.  Let me talk a little about the labor markets. They remain soft but ar e showing some signs of firming.  According to some of the payroll data we’ve looked at, employm ent was flat for our Dist rict in September.  However, layoff announcements are down from earlie r in the year, and more firms say that they are planning to hire or are thinking about hiri ng.  I would note anecdotally that firms announcing job increases in the last couple of months include several call centers, a major railroad, several manufacturers in our area, and a number of high-tech firms in Colorado.  To the relief of people in both Kansas City and Tulsa, American Airlines  decided not to lay off workers at its two large maintenance facilities in those cities. On the manufacturing side, activity actually strengthened further.  Production and new orders both increased, and exp ectations for future production a nd orders remained relatively high.  Capital spending also improved somewhat.  Although employment remained below year-ago levels, the average workweek did rise not iceably.  On the negative side, aircraft manufacturing continued to struggle, with little improvement expected until 2005.  I would note that from August to September the year-over-year production index from our survey of manufacturers rose from 8 to 17, the new orders index climbed from 22 to 31, and the capital spending index improved from 0 to 12.  Moreover, pr eliminary data received for October as late as yesterday suggest that these trends persisted in October. Consumer spending continued to edge up de spite the softer labor market that I mentioned.  Retailers contacted al so said that they had had pre tty good sales and their confidence remained strong.  Housing activity increased further, setting new records in most of the areas except for Denver where it’s a little slower.  Comm ercial real estate does remain weak in the 50 of 126region, and energy activity is expa nding but at a moderate pace.  State and local budgets show further signs of improvement, with some tax revenue increases in several of our states.  But I would caution that to some extent those numbers re flect tax increases.  On the agricultural side, forecasts for net income have moved up as much  as 22 percent over last year.  But I would remind you that about $20 billion of federal farm payments are included in those numbers.   Let me turn to the national outlook.  The economic forces are in place for a relatively robust recovery.  That assessment is based on current monetary policy, fiscal policy, productivity, and a good strong financial system th at can support credit needs going forward.  Overall, I expect growth through th e end of next year to be above 4 percent, a little better than the Blue Chip consensus but not quite as strong as the Greenbook forecast.  As noted, a recovery in capital spending and an increa se in employment remain two ri sks to our achieving sustainable economic growth.  But I’m hearing about some increases in capital spending from the people we talk to, and we see some evidence of it in the nu mbers.  In my conversations with CEOs in the District, there’s a clear sense of greater confidence and an indication that firms are more willing to undertake planned expansions.  So I’m optimis tic about that.  We also are beginning to see some signs that labor markets are responding to the acceleration in growth over the past several months.  The evidence is very preliminary and tent ative, I realize, but I think it bodes well for the labor markets going forward.   Turning to the inflation outlook, I would say that , in the near term, inflation is likely to remain stable and that the risks going forward are about balanced.  A continued decline in the dollar could put upward pressure  on inflation.  Although the output gap may put some downward pressure on inflation, I am reluctant to put a lot of  weight on that gap as a predictor of inflation.  51 of 126Research here and elsewhere suggests that the pr edictive powers of the output gap on inflation are difficult to find. Finally, on the topic of policy let me say that I clearly would be of the view that for now we should maintain policy where it is.  I think any change would actually be harmful in the current environment.  However, given recent data, I’m not convinced that we can define a period within which we can keep rates this low.  I al so think it’s important that the public come to realize, as President Parry suggested, that an  accommodative policy refers  to the level of the funds rate and not to the direction of any change .  Although I do not have a point estimate of the long-run equilibrium for the funds rate, it probably is more likely in a range of 3 to 4 percent than near 1 percent.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus. MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would describe the information that we’ve received on our District’s economy recently  as generally mixed.  Of course, a hurricane hit us shortly after our last meeting. The stor m uprooted a lot of trees , caused extensive power outages, and forced some business closings for a while, but I don’t think it has had any significant longer-term effect on the regional ec onomy.  Again, the overall information we’ve received is mixed.  I would say that many service industries seem to be doing reasonably well at this point but manufacturing activ ity, which appeared to be impr oving a little during the summer months, has softened most recently according to our latest monthly survey.  Both shipments and new orders have been declining at a number of facilities, an d additional layoffs have been announced at several textile  and apparel plants.   I’d like to focus for a minute or two on th e anecdotal information we’ve received as opposed to the recent data.  We’ve talked with a number of people in recent weeks, and I would 52 of 126say that on balance they’re probably a little more op timistic than they were at the time of the last meeting but not much.  Most of our business contacts are still more than normally uncertain about the outlook, and hence they’re  still hesitant to commit to significant new investments or workforce expansions.  We had a joint meeting of all three of our boards—the Baltimore and Charlotte boards as well as the Richmond boar d—here in D.C. a couple of weeks ago.  I thought the tone of the economic discussion at that meeting was remarkably restrained, given all the media hype about the possibility that the expansi on is beginning to acceler ate.  If those board members could see the Greenbook projection, they probably all woul d be surprised.  Some of them would be encouraged but I think a few at least would think we’ve been smoking something.   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I just want the record to sh ow that that is not the case!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I withdraw that statement!  Turning to the national economy, the lead story in this Greenbook, of course, is the 2 percentage point upward re vision, to 6¼ percent, in the third-quarter growth rate.  Given estima ted potential GDP, there’s a chance, as we all know, that the output gap has shrunk from around 3 percent in the second quarter to below 2 percent in the third quarter.  In the staff projection, the gap has been marked down to about ½ percent at the end of next year.  Incidentally, I think it’s very he lpful to have that number in the Greenbook explicitly, and I appreciate your putting it there.  In any case,  it’s obviously a very encouraging projection, as we’ve not ed already in our discussion.   But it’s important to note that, in the third quarter, firms met the stepped-up demand with continued high productivity growth  and actually slightly  lower aggregate hours worked than in the second quarter.  So in that sense the job ma rket weakened further in  the third quarter, and what one might call the employment gap actually widened further since aggregate hours need to grow at an annual rate of around 1 percent to absorb the normal in crease in the labor force.  So 53 of 126there’s a tension or divergence, whatever the right word is, between a narrowing output gap and a widening employment gap in the third quarter that’s going to have to be resolved one way or another. I’m really looking at what we’ve been talki ng about in just a little different way.  The Greenbook resolves the divergence by assuming that the recent exceptio nally high productivity growth reflects the extraordinar y reluctance of firms to hire a nd rehire workers.  The Greenbook projection assumes that this factor starts to abate next year with productivity growth slowing dramatically as firms begin to hire very aggressively to meet rising demands.  Demand grows fast enough in the forecast to reduce the exce ss supply of labor by the end of next year. But there’s an alternative resolution that’s wo rth considering, and I guess this is one of those dark thoughts that you mentioned in your br iefing, David.  If productivity continues to grow as rapidly as demand next year—either because productivity grows more rapidly than expected or because demand grows more slowly  than expected—the consequence in this alternative scenario is that the job market remains weak.  The weak job market, in turn, gives rise to a bigger decline in uni t labor costs than projected in the Greenbook.  As a result, because firms tend to pass persistently falling uni t labor costs through to prices, th ere’s more disinflation in this alternative scenario th an in the Greenbook baseline.  So we wind up with a slower narrowing of both the output gap and what I call the employme nt gap as well as more disinflation.  Also, monetary policy might have to be a part of the resolution of such a scenario.  Conceivably, we might have to lower the nominal funds rate going fo rward either to keep th e real rate from rising or to reduce the real rate in order to stimulate the economy.   So in sum, I like the Greenbook forecast.  It’s very easy to love, and I don’t think it’s implausible.  But we need to keep in mind, at least for the time being, the less favorable 54 of 126alternative scenario that I’ve described and that others have described in  different ways here today, as we think about policy, the statement, th e wording of the announcement, and all the rest.  The risks with respect to price stability as I see it are still decidedly on the downside, and I think we need to indicate that clearly in our decision and our announcement today. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Most signs of economic recovery in the Third District have strengthened over the intermeeting period, unlike some of the reports we’ve heard from my neighboring Districts.  The exception is the labor market indicators, which have not shown any improvement.  The job market  in our region has fared better than in the nation as a whole.  Stronger job growth in educa tion and health services and in the leisure and hospitality industry in our District’s states compar ed with the growth in th ese sectors in the rest of the nation contributed to the re gion’s better job performance.  That said, District labor markets still are characterized as weak.  Pennsylvania and Delaware payrolls remain below their levels at the end of the recession.  Only Ne w Jersey has seen job growth, as  First Vice Pr esident Stewart indicated in his coverage of the nor thern Jersey employment numbers.  We have received better news from the manuf acturing and retail sector s.  We have solid evidence of a recovery in manuf acturing, although structural cha nge has continued to limit the strength in that sector.  Se veral indicators in our busine ss outlook survey show strong improvement this month.  The index of general activity advanced sharply to plus 28 percent, its highest reading since 1996 and the fifth consecutive positive readi ng.  The indexes of new orders and shipments also advanced and are at their highest levels since mid-1999.  Even the employment index turned slightly positive this month.  However, most firms surveyed are not back to their pre-recession levels of production.  Nearly three-quarters said they experienced 55 of 126production declines during th e recession, and less than one-fifth of  these firms expect to be back to pre-recession levels in the firs t quarter of 2004.  More than one-t hird said they expected not to return to those levels in the foreseeable future , which by that survey question meant the end of 2004.  Most respondents cited as re asons long-term declines in th eir industry and loss of market share to competitors both here and abroad.  These numbers might help us to quantify the degree to which the current weakness in manufacturing is due to structural as opposed to cyclical factors.   Retail sales in our region continue to impr ove modestly.  September sales were up from tax rebates and a good back-to-sc hool season that boosted August sales.  Our retailers have revised upward their fourth-quarter sales foreca sts.  Respondents to our south Jersey business survey, 85 percent of whom are in nonmanufactur ing areas, reported an increase in equipment spending in the third quarter a nd plans for even stronger spending six months from now.  And residential investment in the District remains high despite increasing mortgage  interest rates.  So, overall the recovery continues to  build momentum in the Third Di strict, and business contacts in our region, including those on our board of directors, are expr essing more optimism than I’ve heard for a while. Economic conditions in the nation have improved since our last meeting as well.  Growth in the third quarter was very strong, but firms raised productivity  and thus continued to shed workers.  I agree with the Greenbook that demand will continue to grow at  a solid pace in the current quarter, although somewhat slower than last quarter, and th at we’ll finally begin to see payroll job growth.  Conditions are supportive of conti nued strengthening next year.  Equipment and software spending is expanding at a good pace.  The stronger da ta for orders and shipments 56 of 126coupled with robust growth in corporate prof its should help boost business investment going forward.  I would welcome a period of strong growth since a significant amount of economic slack in labor and product markets still remains, as others have indica ted, and core inflation continues to be subdued.  Nonetheless, I believe that the risk of pern icious disinflation has subsided somewhat.   I agree with the Greenbook that inflationary fo rces are likely to be muted over the near term.  But I believe that we will have to begi n to take some of the monetary accommodation back to help ensure that we don’t get any in flation—and probably earlier than mid-2005 as the Greenbook assumes.  Accordingly, given the st rengthening of the underlying economy and the forecast of continued improvement over the next several quarters, I think we should begin to shorten the expected time frame of ongoing accommodation.  But this brings me quite close to the next topic, which is our communication polic y.  So I’ll end my comments here before I go too far into that agenda item.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The 2001 recession is now nearly two years behind us, and I believe that most peopl e in the Fourth District have accepted, perhaps surprisingly, that the economy is expanding.  Even our manufacturers are seeing evidence of improvement in business activity.  Our steel producers report that the worst may be over and that prices are actually firming in so me markets.  Machine-tool make rs report that they also are seeing a pickup in orders from small and medi um-size businesses as a result of the special depreciation allowance for capital goods. Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of a nxiety about the sustaina bility of the recent upturn in business activity.  I’m told by my busine ss contacts that the expansion lacks balance.  57 of 126Bankers, for example, are having a profitable year, but they would prefer to  have a larger portion of commercial loans in their loan portfolios.  Manufacturers in my District remain uneasy over the pressures they face from global competition, and I doubt whether that pressure is going to dissipate any time soon.  As a me mber of my Small Business Advi sory Council put it last week, old line thinkers who looked through the business cycle expecting their order books to return to normal are now exiting their businesses.  There is no “normal” any more.   Recessions and their immediate aftermath acc ount for much of the trend decline in manufacturers’ share of overall employment, and this cycle is no different.  CEOs continue to report that they are using this downturn to reassess their business strategies, to reexamine their product lines, and to reexamine the location of th eir facilities.  As th ey sort through these options, companies continue to be cautious—o r maybe I should say disciplined—about their expansion plans, including their hiring plan s.  Their comments, though recently a bit more optimistic, do not suggest an impending rebound in  hiring on the order of magnitude of the acceleration that the Greenbook forecasts in 2004.  Productivity and profitability are figuring prominently in everyone’s thinking about the business outlook.  CEOs report that they can still generate productivity increases  by reorganizing their business processes and by implementing new production technologies.  For example, a metal stamper firm  in our District reported purchasing for only $120,000 a machine that cost $1 million three years ago, and that machine is going to do the work of five people.  So he exp ects to make a profit with  this technology and is focusing on increasing sales, but he’s not going to increase his workforce in the near future.   It’s not entirely clear to me how to think about the curr ent high rate of joblessness and low rate of capacity utilization.  Again, I wonder whether these resources are simply underemployed or whether they have become obso lete.  The story of the metal stamper is not 58 of 126unique.  Many manufacturers in my District tell me that resour ces, both capital and labor, have lost their economic value during the past several years.  Pe rhaps the lower economic value placed on these resources represents a slowdown in  potential output.  Translating, therefore, what I’ve heard from my District co ntacts into the Greenbook projections, I would end up with a scenario close to what President Broaddus and so me others talked abou t earlier this morning—that is, somewhat slower empl oyment growth and somewhat fa ster productivity growth over the next several years.  As David Stockton commented earlier, thes e two factors could still yield roughly the same output and income path as in the Greenbook.  But as noted by President Broaddus and others, these two factors—slower  employment growth with somewhat higher productivity growth—could also lead  to further disinflation.  Howeve r, if it’s reason able to think that the economy has sustained a slowdown in the rate of growth of potential, then looking forward, the disinflation implicati ons could be less troublesome th an in the Greenbook baseline.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A pr eponderance of the reports on the District economy have been positive, but before I quickly  summarize those findings let me just identify the sectors that are still soft.  One, of course, is commercial co nstruction, where activity is quite subdued.  The second is tourism.  Tourism ha s improved over time, but it has still been a mediocre year for that industry in the Distri ct.  And although business attitudes are certainly better than they were nine or twelve months ago, I would have to say that they are still cautious.  Other than that, though, I thi nk the District economy has tracked the national economy reasonably well, as it typically does.  We have seen gains in em ployment in the private sector over the past several months, but since st ate and local governments are still reducing 59 of 126employment, those gains have not shown through to any great extent in the overall job numbers.  Strength in consumer spending has been sustai ned, and housing activity and related measures have strengthened further.  I would judge, ba sed on anecdotes, that manufacturing has improved in the District over the past seve ral months.  One final piece of information on the District comes from a contact who is knowledgeable about frei ght shipments through a variety of modes—that is rail, barge, and truck—and he has reported that both volumes and prices have increased perceptibly in recent months. As far as the national economy is concerned, like the Greenbook I am optimistic.  If I have any reservation, it’s the one  that I alluded to earlier, name ly that I would expect to get something like the Greenbook forecast but with gr eater increases in produ ctivity and somewhat smaller increases in employment, acknowledging that forecasting productivit y in the short run is probably close to impossible.  But if that scenario  were to come to pass, that would reinforce my conviction that inflation is going to stay low.  If one adheres to gap analysis, though, I suppose one would have to allow for the pos sibility that inflation could go ev en lower.  Personally I think that would be a benign development, but I realiz e that many people around this table have come to a different conc lusion about that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like ot hers, I’ll try to address two issues—the prospects for growth in activity and the prospects for jobs.  With  respect to demand and activity, the question is to what degree the strength of recent months can be sustained next year.  It will come as no surprise to my colleagues in light of  my recent presentations to this Committee that I’m optimistic in this regard.  Stimulative fina ncial conditions and fiscal  policy are beginning to show through to growth.  In th e absence of further downward shoc ks or reasons for business or 60 of 126households to turn more cautious, I see no reason  why that won’t continue, with only a modest downshift in growth from the thir d quarter as in the staff forecast.   While fiscal policy won’t be quite as expansionary next year, it still will be boosting demand.  Moreover, even as private final demand might moderate a little, perhaps reacting to the falloff in fiscal stimulus, the growth of economic activity should be bolstered as more demand is met from production rather than by drawing down inventories. Financial conditions have been expansionary for some time.  They became a little more so over the intermeeting period as  equity prices rose and the dollar fell, while corporate bond rates remained roughly stable or even moved down a little for lower-rated credits.  Whether long-term interest rates will ease, as in the staff forecast, I think is somewhat questionable.  But judging from the recent experience, the risks around the assumption of a slight further decline in the dollar are probably tilted toward  a steeper falloff.  Moreover,  the drag on our economy from weakness abroad is abating.  To be sure, some of the stronger global pros pects reflect a better outlook for the U.S. economy.  But I’m impressed by the rise in interest rates and equity prices abroad over the summer and early fall, even w ith the dollar depreciation.  Financial markets abroad must be sensing some a dded domestic demand as well.   I see upside and downside risks to the for ecast of reasonably strong growth along the lines of the Greenbook.  On the upside, business caution may erode faster than in the staff forecast, where investment spending conti nues to undershoot forecasts based on past relationships with accelerators, ca sh flows, and the cost of capital.  In the Greenbook the surprise in the incoming data was incorporated into a hi gher level of GDP and a smaller output gap, while leaving growth rates after the third quarter largely unaffected.  In effect, the recent data are not interpreted as a signal that the dynamics of the e xpansion have changed mate rially, and the return 61 of 126to full employment continues to be relatively slow given the low level of interest rates and stimulative fiscal policy.  The damped response in  demand was reflected in a chart in yesterday’s briefing, which showed that the natural interest  rate implied in the staff forecast remains abnormally low, especially relative to the assume d relatively rapid rate of growth of potential.  Growth in the latter should be ra ising equilibrium real interest rate s.  But with the rise in profits and equity prices and persistent  increases in sales, business re sponses could return to normal more quickly and fully than is assumed in the forecast, allowing much  more of the natural resiliency of the economy to show through to ev en stronger spending.  The upward revision to upside risk. I believe that the major downside risk is  in the household sector, which has been supporting the economy under the influence of low inte rest rates.  The saving rate remains quite low.  Both debt and real assets continue to pi le up on each side of the household balance sheet, and the saving rate only edges higher in the fore cast.  It’s not so much the debt burden that constitutes a downward risk; rather it’s the possi bility that households may decide that the returns on greater portfolios of fi nancial assets.  We’ve seen no ev idence of that yet.  Housing remains remarkably strong.  But it could be that tendencies in this direction have been masked in the short run by the effects of the tax cuts.  So we will need to watch that the leveling-off in consumption in September isn’t a forerunner.   In sum, strong growth going forward seems a reasonable expectation.  But the economy is emerging from a highly unusual cycle in which pr evious signposts and hi storical relationships haven’t provided much guidance, and any predic tion must have an extremely wide confidence 62 of 126interval around it.  That’s also my conclusion regarding the forecasts of whether even strong growth will erode margins of slack in labor and capital markets.  We have experienced another quarter of an astounding increase in productivity.  In this case, for a very good reason the staff structural productivity.  This sugge sts to me some upside risk on potential growth, as a number of others have commented.  It’s possible that pote ntial growth could be stronger than is built into the staff forecast without inducing much feedb ack into spending for a while.  Low household savings suggest that households ar e already expecting fairly str ong growth in lifetime income.  Businesses are clearly renewing and upgrading capita l stock.  It’s not yet clear that they see a need to increase that stock very much to meet expanding sales.  They still may not be very confident that sales will grow at a rate that requires larger pro ductive capacity.  In addition, as a number of you have noted, they may not see the need to expand capacity ; judging from the third quarter results, businesses have not run out of ways to rearrange producti on processes to meet growing demand.   My point here is not to second-guess the productivity forecast but to  recognize the vast uncertainty about the supply side of the economy th at businesses continue to work under.  We had 6 percent growth in the third quarter and a small decline in payroll employment.  Whatever the growth rate of the economy pr edicted or realized, even if it’s very strong, we’ll need to watch actual labor and capital utiliza tion to infer how we are likely  to be doing relative to our objectives for high employment and stable prices.  Uncertainty on both the demand and the supply sides of the economy makes forecast-based policy especially problematic.  Fortunately, in the current circumstances it’s not as important as it often might be.  Policy is already highly accommodative, and the economy seems to be headed  up, but there is enough slack that we can 63 of 126afford to wait for reasonably definitive signs be fore deciding that the economy is on track for drawing down those unused margins of resources and damping disinflation pressures.  Until we see that hard evidence, in my vi ew the risks to output  growing around the rate of growth of its potential are balanced, and the ri sks to inflation are likely to remain downward.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I don’t have much to say this morning.  We’ve planted the flowers.  Now is the time to watch them grow.  There are some risks that a number of you have spoken about—for example, labor demand and wh ere that is.  One risk that has not been discussed much is fiscal policy.  Th e staff forecast has the fiscal effect declining very sharply in 2004.  It’s conceivable that, if our friends up on Capitol Hill get religion, some tax cuts may not be extended and we could get some reaction even before then.  It’s also conceivable that, if they don’t get religion, we could see some adjustment in interest rates.  So I think that set of issues has some dangers. I had been a little worried about the timing becau se of the pattern of retail sales; growth was very strong in July and August and weakened quite a bit in September.   First, the numbers could be revised.  Second, the new orders statisti cs that we got this morning and the strength in housing seem to belie any September weakness, so there may be no particular problem in that pattern.  There are some risks, bu t basically, to return to my pr evious metaphor, the flowers seem to be growing at a healthy rate , and I don’t think we ought to ch ange either our policy or our approach.  With that I’m going to obey Dave  Stockton’s earlier injunction and cede time—hopefully a little to myself—for th e discussion on communication policy. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 64 of 126

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At every meeting we have to do three things: (1) assess the eco nomy and risks to the outlook, (2) de cide the policy implications, and (3) talk about communication.  R ecognizing that the third topic is  going to be exciting today—one hopes—I’ll try to be br ief on the first two.   On the assessment of the economy, it’s clear that  the third and fourth quarters seem to be extremely robust.  One recognizes obviously, as Ned Gramlich just mentioned, that the pattern particularly with respect to real PCE growth di d slow a little in September.  But that doesn’t leave me with any great concern.  I think the overall pattern of PCE growth is still well maintained.  Similarly, I would point to the demand for both new and existing homes as being very strong; and this morning’s data on shipment s and orders also sugge st that the third and fourth quarters are likely to be very robust.  Fo rtunately, it also appears that the sources of the turnaround seem to be broadening somewhat.  The industrial sector is st arting to show some signs of strength.  Industrial pr oduction appears to have expanded in the third quarter, and it’s possible that capacity utilization is  also starting to firm somewhat.  I’d say that the labor market, which is the biggest question mark we’ve been de aling with, does seem to be giving some early signs of stabilizing.  We haven’t talked much about it in this ro om today but when the September jobs data came out, that got quite a bit of attention in the press, and we shouldn’t forget that the news was positive.  Similarly, the revisions to the job declines in July and August were all in the right direction and were consiste nt with a gradual bottoming of the labor market.  The four-week moving average of initial claims declined a bit,  and the household survey data suggested that layoffs might be subsiding.  So overall I’d say that the Greenbook was right in terms of moving up expectations for the third and fourth quarters.   65 of 126That leads to the second issue, which is how one assesses the future.  In that regard I can understand and generally feel reasonably comforta ble with the logic of the Greenbook forecast.  The Greenbook assumes that the st ep-up in productivity will con tinue, though it hasn’t taken in all the increases recently as permanent.  The s timulative policies plus some assumptions about multiplier and accelerator effects all result in an  economy that grows at a bout 5 percent per year, creates jobs and wealth, and then has the unemp loyment rate falling gradually.  As President Broaddus said, the Greenbook forecast is certainly easy to love.  If I were from the Dallas District I’d probably have a catc hy tune about how easy love may be  fleeting love.  [Laughter]   Let me talk about the risks that are associated with this forecast.  I think it’s easy to see risks on the downside, as Cathy ha s pointed out.  One of the risk s is that so much of what happened in the third quarter and so  far in the fourth quarter seems to have been driven by policy stimulus.  Real pre-tax income was essentially un changed during the summer months of the year.  As that effect starts to wane, there’s a possibility that we won’t get quite the ki nd of uptick that the Greenbook expects.  And while David and Vin cent gave us a number of stories, if you will, about why demand for C&I loans has been very sl ow to turn around, the bankers I’ve talked to certainly are worried about it.  They seem to think that it may really be a sign of slower growth than the Greenbook forecast suggests.  I recently had a meeting with the real estate roundtable, and across the board that group wa s quite subdued.  So some anec dotal information suggests that our staff forecast is a bit more hopeful than many people, at least many in the real world, are at this stage.  Add to that the fact that the Greenbook forecast is already above the Blue Chip consensus, and it seems that some concer n about the downside risks is warranted. On the upside, though, I think one must say that rarely at this stage of an expansion has the economy seen this kind of fiscal and monetary stimulus—with interest rates extremely low, 66 of 126prices stable, the dollar coming off, productiv ity increasing, financial conditions turning, and earnings relatively strong.  Thos e and a variety of other factor s could lead to some upside potential around the forecast.  So I’d say that  even around our relatively optimistic forecast, while love may be fleeting, the risks are relatively balanced. With respect to policy, I suspect that, when we  get to that point of our discussion, there’s not going to be very much to say.  With respec t to communication I, like others, will restrain myself as best I can except to say that I believe the interaction between policy and communication today is such that  the Committee would be very well advised to take a fairly cautious approach.  We have a great deal to discus s, and I’d hate for us to get ahead of ourselves in the statement that we make at 2:15 today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  I have a couple of comments.  After two people in a row have said that they’re going to be brief, I think I should say ex actly the same thing, and I will.  Over the past week I’ve talked to a number of  bankers whose comments essentiall y reinforced a lot of what we have heard around the table.  Two community ba nkers, one in the upper Midwest and one in the Southwest, had exactly the same observation. Th ey are feeling additional competitive pressures from the nation’s largest banks as those banks come after the small business market.  That supports the appetite for increased risks that we ’ve seen around the count ry.  I think it supports also the notion that the slack demand for commercial loans has forced banks to reach toward other kinds of loan opportunities.  A regional le nder in the Midwest had a slightly different perspective, but it was along the same lines.  He  noted the difference between the response he was getting from his front-line lenders as opposed to what he was getting from the credit department people.  The front line people felt that  there was a good deal of  increased activity but 67 of 126that it had not yet translated into loans.  The one exception was lending to businesses that were exercising purchase options for currently leased f acilities. That, too, suppor ts the view that a lot of the lending is either to lock  in liquidity or to restructure and improve the overall ability of business entities to finance growth internally, which is what I think I heard Dave Stockton and others say.   In talking to some contacts in  institutional and custodial se rvice businesses, a couple of other trends came to light.  One was another reaffirmation of the shift by consumers into equities, a trend that had been obvious but has become even  more obvious within the last six weeks.  But the institutional investors were moving offshor e, in many cases to emerging Asia, which is consistent also with the story in the Greenbook in terms of expectations for growth there. Pulling together what I’ve b een hearing—notably the change in risk appetites, which was probably the most obvious—it appears that a lot of lending continues to be for balance sheet restructuring.  Much of the lending tends to be  in anticipation of improvement in the underlying economy.  To the extent that there are increases  in capital expenditure s, they are not being reflected in new C&I loans in the banking industry.  But in comp aring the feedback we were getting with regard to inhibitions to capital investment six months ago versus now, I had the impression that there was a significant change.  Six months ago we we re hearing the terms “psychology” or “psychological,” whereas now in describing the underlying economy contacts are using words like “confidence” or “optimistic” or perhaps “cautious.”  The use of the word “psychology” suggested that there was an irrationality to the decisions on capital spending—that the decisions were not based on an analysis of the underlying data but we re independent of the data.  We were looking at strength in consum er demand over the period, and that was not being taken into account by the business sector.  Now at least the underlying economic data are being 68 of 126analyzed and taken into account to some degree.  So while we  have not yet seen the same traction as in previous recoveries, th e change in attitudes is very obvious.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.   Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to make one comment on current conditions and then talk a bit more about the longer-run part of the Greenbook forecast.  I was struck as I looked at the Greenbook forecast ab out where we are with regard to business investment in this expansion and by some of the information on capital spending that we’re getting from various business surveys, much of which is included in the Greenbook materials.  We’ve already noted that corpor ate cash flow is very strong and that we’re beginning to see some firming up of business investment.  But the responses to the qualitative questions that are asked in surveys clearly show th at businesses are reluctant to expand.  Nevertheless, I think there is a tone that says we’re seeing a floor here ; we’re beginning to get out of this slump in investment.  That slump was the root of this bus iness slowdown and, as Governor Olson was just mentioning, the words are starting to  turn positive.  But the vigor of corporate expansion has yet to take hold.  I think the recent information s hows again that we clearly have a way to go.  It worries me when I look at how much stop and go we’ve had in the economy in the last two years.  The Greenbook forecast is assuming that there are no real shocks coming.  We’ve had a number of shocks in the past few years.  Last year business invent ories grew, but then we had the shock of a war in the spring.  There have b een so many starts and stops in this recovery that it may take a little longer to prove that there is some stabili ty out there and to get businesses into an expansion mode versus just a replacem ent mode.  Clearly their financial strength is extraordinary.  The corporate cas h flow and earnings numbers coming out this quarter all look very, very strong. 69 of 126In thinking about the longer-term forecast a nd where we are heading, I was struck, too, by the wonderful optimism in the Greenbook for ecast compared with some of the outside forecasts.  I just want to comme nt on two aspects of this that I’m still sorting through in my own mind.  One is that we’ve had an extraordinary ru n in productivity over the last few quarters.  Yet when we look forward, productivity growth for th e last six quarters of the Greenbook forecast falls below the recent numbers.  I understand that  a big part of the productivity performance is cyclical.  But the projected drop in productivity  growth is coming right when the economy is really picking up.  So we have this tension in the forecast, I think, wh ere we see employment growing—extraordinary job grow th—and productivity slowing.  Ye t we still have inflation trending down until the tail end of the forecast pe riod.  In the Street, as market observers talk about expectations—and it’s a factor in our communication policy—they say that once employment starts expanding, infl ation is going to pick up.  That is going to be one of the challenges we face if we believe in the Greenbo ok forecast.  In fact, of all the alternative scenarios, there’s only one that results in an inflation rate that’s within hailing distance of 2 percent.  And that’s due only to  the fact that people’s inflati on expectations are higher than actual inflation.  Basically in this forecast, depe nding on the inflation measure, we will have had four or five years of inflation numbers that start with a 1 or below, which would be an extraordinary period of low inflation.  That psychology is not what most observers have in their mindset, nor is it part of the business recovery mo dels that we see in the marketplace.  So we need to think about how we talk  about these issues going forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bernanke. MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wa s interested in the likely evolution of the federal funds rate over the next two years.  So I asked the staff to use their best fitting 70 of 126estimated Taylor rules together with both Greenbook and private sector forecasts to project some sample interest rate paths.  The rules the st aff chose were a backwa rd-looking Taylor rule estimated over the 1988-98 period and a forw ard-looking, or forecast-based, Taylor rule estimated over the same period using FOMC centr al tendency forecasts on the right-hand side plus some additional data assumptions.  By the way, this latter rule is the one discussed in some detail in Dave Lindsey’s magnum opus on communi cation.  Both Taylor rules allowed for error correction terms—that is, a lagged interest rate in the equation.  The proj ections were run using actual data plus either Greenbook or Blue Chip  forecasts on the right-hand side and then compared with funds rate forecasts obtained from the fed funds futures markets.  Note that this exercise treats the Greenbook foreca st as given.  No attempt was ma de to reconcile the funds rate projection obtained with the funds rate a ssumptions used in deriving the forecast. Let me summarize a couple of interesting results from this exercise.  First, the backward-looking rule would have the current funds rate at  about 1.50 percent.  The actual current value of 1 percent presumably reflects in part our insura nce policy against deflat ion.  Assuming that the extra 50 basis points are phased out  in a linear way over the next two years, the path that is suggested by the backward-looking rule would go a bout as follows:  It’s cu rrently at 1 percent; it would be 1.25 percent by the end of the first quart er of next year, 1.50 per cent at the end of the second quarter, 2.25 percent at the end of 2004, and finally 3.50 percent at the end of 2005.  The backward-looking rule applied to the Blue Chip da ta gave a fairly similar, though slightly more aggressive, path through 2004.  The Blue Chip data don’t go out far enough to do a projection through 2005.  What I found most interesting ab out the results using the backward-looking Taylor rule is that they correspond extremely clos ely to what comes out of the futures market.  The numbers are almost exactly the same.  So the main lesson I learned from this exercise is that 71 of 126the market is using historical relationships and backward-looking type Tayl or rules to figure out what we’re going to be doing in the future.   There was an interesting contrast to the resu lts when I used the forward-looking rule.  In particular, the forward-looking Tayl or rule implies a much slower tightening process.  Indeed according to that projection, the funds rate will reach only 1.50 percent by the end of 2004 rather than the 2.25 percent forecast by both the futu res market and the backward-looking rule.  The Greenbook forecast horizon doesn’t permit a projection through 2005, though, so I couldn’t make that comparison.  Why the difference?  Me chanically, the difference arises because the forward-looking rule puts a high weight on infl ation expectations, and of course, using the Greenbook forecast we have a very low inflation rate expected over the forecast period.  So that’s the mechanical reason.   Which of these rules should we take more se riously?  Personally, I see some advantages in the forward-looking rule for two reasons.  One is that it’s a true real-time rule—that is, it estimates reaction functions given actual foreca sts available at the tim e the policy decision was taken.  Second, as Governor Bies mentioned, we’r e now in a period that is very unusual, and historical relationships may not work.  So it’s useful that the forw ard-looking rule can take into account explicitly how forecasts affect current policy  decisions.  The implications of this, I think, are interesting.  To me it says that our policy stance is going to depend very much on what we think inflation is going to do.  Suppose we buy the Greenbook forecast on inflation.  I’m not making a judgment here; I personally think that inflation will remain low and stable over the forecast period, but not everyone does.  But if we  do agree with that inflation outlook, then at least based on this estimated ru le our policy tightening should be slower and more gradual than suggested by historical relationshi ps or by the funds rate futures ma rkets.  That leads finally to 72 of 126two conclusions.  One is that we should be especi ally vigilant about the inflation rate and where we think it’s going to go.  Second, we have an ongoing communication issue.  If this is the way that policy proceeds, over time in one way or another we will have to bring expectations in the market in line with our actual policy.   Let me make one brief comment on communication.  I just want to say that I very much appreciate the contributions a nd thoughts people have had, and I’m  very open to the kinds of modifications that have been suggested.  But I would echo Governor Fe rguson’s suggestion that for the time being we go relatively slowly.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very mu ch.  We now go to Vincent Reinhart. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I w ill be referring to the materials that Carol Low handed out during the coffee br eak.  As shown in the top left panel of your first exhibit, investors seem to have raised the path expected for the federal funds rate over the course of 2004.  They are still counting on cumulative tightening to bring the federal funds rate to 3 pe rcent by the end of 2005, but they are now betting on the Committee to be a bit quicker in getting there.  That said, market participants apparently don’t anticipate that  process to begin at this meeting or the next.  Futures rates over the balance of the year are unchanged at 1 percent.  Moreover, as shown in the table at the right, primary dealers do not expect any substantive change in the economic assessm ent issued this afternoon.  With only a couple of exceptions, they expect you to announce that  risks are balanced with respect to your growth obj ectives and tilted to the downs ide with regard to price stability, with the latter remaining the predominant risk.    Other manifestations of this shift in exp ectations are given in the middle panels.  The solid black line in the middle left panel plots a measure of uncertainty about the federal funds rate expected in the next six months.  For most of the summer and early fall, investors have been relatively confid ent that the funds rate will remain near current levels six months hence, no doubt importantly because of your assurances in the statements of August and September th at policy can be kept accommodative for a considerable period.  In r ecent weeks, though, there has been a growing sense that a turning point may be drawing closer, and this measure of implied volatility has moved higher.  The middle right panel plots the distribution of th e federal funds rate about six months ahead derived from options  quotes yesterday (the solid bars) and just before the September meeting (the da shed line).  More weight is now being placed on funds rates in the neighborhood of 1½ to 1¾, apparently at the expense of odds on the funds rate holding at 1 percent or going lower.  Aside from the                                                  2 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). 73 of 126encouraging data on the economy, developments in financial markets may have made investors more confident about the outlook.  As can be seen in the bottom panels of the exhibit, financial market conditions ha ve eased considerably on net this year, including a modest contribution ma de over the intermeeting period.  I list this improvement in financial conditions  first at the top of the next exhibit, which outlines the case for an unchanged target federal funds ra te.  You may view eased financial conditions to be one consequence of the current accommodative stance of monetary policy.  As shown in the middle panel, the real federal funds rate, represented by the solid line, lies below the ra nge of estimated equili brium real rates.  Indeed, a firming outlook for the economy ha s meant that r* is  an upwardly m oving target.  Keeping the real federal funds rate  unchanged in such circumstances implies a widening interest-rate gap.  That may be  especially troubling if you think that pressures on resources may emerge a bit fast er than the staff forecasts.  As shown in the bottom left panel, in the Greenbook proj ection, the near-term surprise in the level of real GDP has been carried over the enti re forecast period, the difference between the dotted line for September and the red line  for October.  Particularly if you thought that there was some risk that the most rece nt surprise also tilted up that red line some or that the speed of its ascent represents  looming pressures on inflation independent of the output gap, you might be inclined, at a minimum, to keep policy on hold.  Financial market participants may be expres sing just those sorts of concerns in the upward climb in inflation compensation as measured from the Treasury market (the bottom right panel).  These measures have moved higher looking over the next five years (the black line) and from five to te n years ahead (the red line).  Of course, inflation compensation is a far-from-perfect  proxy for inflation expectations, and these measures have not broken noticeably out of their range of the previous four years, but you might believe a neighborhood of  2 to 2½ percent to be on the high side of your objective.  To be sure, a pickup in pressures on inflation is not part of the staff forecast.  Indeed, the case for easing 25 ba sis points, which is laid out  at the top of exhibit 3, could rest on the view that, as resource sl ack lingers, inflation may drift into an unacceptably low region—if it is not already there.  In the Greenbook baseline, the unemployment rate, seen as a solid line in the middle left panel, makes only a gradual approach to its natural rate of 5 percent by the end of 2005.  Policy ease at this time might be viewed as helpful in work ing down economic slack more quickly.  Moreover, such monetary policy impetus woul d be welcomed after the fact if a less robust expansion eventuates.  In Part 1 of the Greenbook, the staff used the FRB/US model to consider what would happen if  the economic recovery faltered at the beginning of next year, the implications of which are plotted as the dashed line in the middle left panel for the unemployment rate  and in the middle right panel for PCE inflation.  Worse still for the unemploymen t rate would be if this hesitation in economic expansion led market participants  to move up their desired compensation for risk (the dotted lines).  In circumstances in which actual inflation is low, inflation expectation are fairly well co ntained, and a sizable output gap remains, putting just a bit of weight on the adverse outcomes of the dashed and dotted lines might incline 74 of 126you toward policy ease.  That inclination might be strengthened by the fact that inflation is projected to fall to below ¾ per cent in 2005 in either of  these scenarios.   Last, at recent meetings, some me mbers took encouragement from the performance of financial flows as eviden ce that there was some fundamental support to economic growth.  As reported in the bot tom left panel, on a twelve-month-change basis, M2 growth has turned down in its most  recent readings.  We think that relates importantly to the effects of a slowing of  mortgage refinanci ng on liquid deposits and so is not a reading on the vigor of the economy, but we may be wrong.  Concern about the performance of M2 might be unde rscored by the fact that other financial flows, including, as seen at the right,  business loan growth, commercial paper issuance, and bond issuance, have all been anemic of late.  The remaining issue for your considerat ion centers on language, which is the subject of your final exhibit.  Two points of  procedure about that language.  First, we included a fuller discussion of  alternatives for the word ing of the announcement in the Bluebook, in the hope of getting some feedback from the members.  We did get some, and in the future we will circulate on the afternoon before the meeting a summary of all the comments received by cl ose of business Friday.  Second, in the Bluebook, we assumed that you intend to fit this afternoon’s stat ement within the current structure and reserve any discussion of  changes to that structure for later.    Within that structure, the top panel re peats a table from the Bluebook and shows that there are only a limited number of combinations of the assessments of the risks to growth and inflation that seem plausible am ong the nine that are logically possible.  The current words lie squarely in the blue  box, in which risks to sustainable economic growth are seen as balanced and inflation more likely to fall than not, with low inflation being the predominant concern.  While the economic outlook has improved, much of that improvement remains a forecast, not firmly established in the data—especially so for readings on the labor mark et.  That said, spending indicators have shown vigor, and the most likel y transition in the near te rm would presumably be a move from that blue box to the yello w box, in which the risks to sustainable economic growth are viewed as weighted to the upside.  Moving the assessment on the inflation outlook to balanced (the green box) seems likely to be a subsequent step, given the current room for the economy to run before resource slack is worked down.  The Committee’s willingness to change the language at all must presumably be related to how it views the last sentence in the August and September announcements, the relevant portion of which is repeated in the middle-left panel.  You might be comfortable in repeating that “polic y accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period” if you believe the Greenbook forecast is likely.  The staff’s assessment of the current shortfall of the level of aggregate demand below that of potential aggregate supply, the likely expa nsion of aggregate supply over time, and the relative unresponsiveness of inflation to diminishing slack in resource utilization combine to suggest that the Committee could keep the funds rate at 1 percent through 2004 and foster acceptable economic performan ce.  An examination of private-sector 75 of 126opinions, however, may leave you with more  concerns about the definition of a “considerable period.”  As shown in th e middle-right panel, readings on money-funds rate to 1¼ percent by midyear.  Wall Street economists, the solid line representing the median of a survey of i nvestment bankers, also expect firming, but a little bit more delayed.  As outlined at th e bottom left, dropping the sentence at this meeting may risk an outsized market reaction, as investors begin to  wonder if the path for policy embedded in futures rates is not  aggressive enough for your taste.  One possibility would be to convert the refere nce from calendar to economic time.  That is, the Committee =s definition of a considerable pe riod could be made contingent upon the outlook for further disinflat ion.  One such possibility, given at the bottom right, would have the statement read th at “the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for the considerable period it currently assesses will be required to foster the moderati on of disinflationary pressures.”  The Committee considered such a change at th e September meeting, felt it to be a close call, and ultimately decided that altering the language would draw more attention than warranted.  You may feel your self still to be in that  position at this meeting. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions for Vincent? 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Vincent, in the top panel of  exhibit 4, there is a column labeled “unwelcome fall.”  One thing we’ve learned in the last two quarters is that productivity has been extraordinarily strong.  Certainly th e probability of a decline in in flation from, let’s say, the level in the forecast may be reasonably remote, but the proportion of it that may be welcome may have changed because of a shift in supply.  There’s no mechanism for reflecting the fact that not all 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Well, I would say that, on one level, rapid growth in aggregate supply only raises the bar for the growth of aggregat e demand that the Committee should desire to get the outcomes it wants.  So in that sense, there still could be unwelcome declines in inflation. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Of course. MR. REINHART.  But they would not be associated with problems relating to the economic expansion.  In general the linking of “u nwelcome” and “disinflation” or “a pickup in inflation” may pose a problem in the current stru cture of this language.  It’s a problem that 76 of 126President Stern also referred to  in his discussion of disinfla tion as not necessarily being problematic.  But I would say that, from the Comm ittee’s perspective, a decline in inflation from current levels, while perhaps not pos ing a threat of serious damage to the economy if it is due to a rapid increase in the aggr egate supply, may send the infl ation rate below your longer-run objective. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  But it appears as  though it would be less unwelcome than we may have thought before we knew what was happening to productivity. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  In that regard, you do ha ve your other assessment to separate the distinction between less unwelcome and more unwelcome.  An  unwelcome decline in inflation that was associated with a grow ing resource gap would presumably be closer to those pernicious deflations that members have expressed concern about in the past.  A decline in inflation associated with balanced economic growth or even upward pressures on economic growth would have different implications for policy.  One thi ng that’s fairly clear to  me in working on the communication policy is that Committee members r eally want a lot of different toggle switches in the statement to express contingencies like this. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Well, in my effort to comm unicate better with you, I feel better.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Just remember, if  you want to parse words, “unwelcome disinflation” is part of disinf lation.  You can size it however you so choose.  That’s what our communication problem is getting us into.  Furthe r questions for Vincent?  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  In regard to President Parry’s comment, perhaps the problem here is that we’re trying to combine two different issu es regarding inflation in this chart—namely, the probability of inflation moving up or down as currently forecast and a qualitative evaluation of 77 of 126that.  Maybe we should separate the two—define the risk of inflation falling, say, which the Committee might then describe as desirable or undesirable depending upon the circumstances.  What I’m struck by is the asymmetry reflected in this box.  We have value judgments associated with the columns but no value judgments associat ed with the rows.  It ’s not clear why we’d necessarily want to start off by having va lue judgments associated asymmetrically. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I view that as a serious problem with the current structure of the language.  In the proposals discussed in the two me mos that I circulated, I separated out the first two statements as being declarative statemen ts about your forecast couched in probability terms—the probability of inflation rising or falli ng and the probability of growth above or below a sustainable rate.  Then I ladled in the welfare judgments, the judgments about relative costs in your objective function.  That is, everything that relates to risk management in a central bank is put into that third sentence.  

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Essentially I’m agreeing with that approach, given the difficulty of communicating the alternative, wh ich blends the two together. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  The more we go into how to s lice and dice and stre ss-test all of these various formulations—whether it’s the curr ent one or the one Vincent proposed in his with untoward circumstances or unintended conseque nces.  I think we need  to take a big step back—not today, for purposes of this meeting—in c onsidering these various proposals.  As I and a lot of other people around the table suggested, given that we’re  not likely to change policy, let’s stay as close as we can to  what we have been saying.  Ma ybe we can fiddle with it or add 78 of 126words to the “considerable period” or maybe not, depending on how we come out on that.  But I’d say leave it alone.  The atmosphere is really difficult out th ere, and I don’t think the recent newspaper articles did us one bit of good in terms of providi ng us with some flexibility to change things.  Even if that were desirable now—and I wouldn’t ag ree that it is—I believe we really need to think about this a lot longer and a lot harder.  I for one would want to take a big step back and even think about whether we want to continue with  a formulation that came out of the old tilt.  Why do we want to continue doing that?  Why do  we want to put out information about the future that we’re all uncomforta ble with?  Saying why we did what we did has enough of a future impact without adding all this information about risk s when we realize that there’s a great deal of uncertainty about the risks.  Th at’s a discussion for another time— maybe at lunch or in January.  I just want to encourage us, please, not to do anyt hing very different this time.  There’s so much to talk about just in te rms of this grid, let alone the seven or  eight variations that you put in your Let’s just stop now and try to figure out what we’re going to  do.  We can have a little conversation over lunch and ta ke it up again in January. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions for Vincent?  If not, let me just say that Cathy is raising a general concern that I think we a ll share.  One can s ee it by trying to use language to calibrate mechanisms that are digital.  Every techni cian will tell you that that leads you nowhere.  In any event, we’re going to get a cl arification of the outlook in the next couple of months, and it will be significant in the sense that  Christmas sales will be a fundamental test of consumer attitudes going forward.  That will resolve the issue of what part of the tax cut actually was spent in the third quarter—75 percent acco rding to Goldman Sachs, significantly less 79 of 126according to most others.  We’ll know that by the time of the January meeting.  The labor need more time to make that judgm ent.  Obviously capital spending is  a crucial issue, and that is apparently improving.  Again the question is, if I may use a new term, whether it is “slogging” away.  [Pause]  There are not many foreign policy buffs around this table!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  That’s another reason for not using the term, by the way.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If it turns out that the economy, after going through this recent surge, simmers down very dramatically and indeed exhibits weakness, then from a policy point of view we’re obviously we ll positioned at this stage.  I think a weakening in economic activity is unlikely.  I believe it’s more likely that evidence of an old-fashioned business cycle expansion is beginning to emerge.  The pieces are falling into place.  Some are little things like the upward revisions to profits, which have been  exceptionally extensive.  We haven’t seen anything like these numbers since the height of the boom back in  the 1990s.  We’re seeing for the first time this year an uptick in the l ong-term outlook for earnings per share.   Unlike in previous periods, the economy is moving forward largely on the basis of final demand, as I think Dave mentioned.  There is no question that in July and August firms were liquidating inventories, and the data we have for September confirm that the liquidation continued through the end of the quarter.  My recollection is th at, when I saw the original Greenbook projection that had inve ntory liquidation continuing thr ough the rest of the year, I was incredulous.  I was even incredulous about it  continuing in the third quarter.  But clearly that’s what we’re seeing.  Indeed, the data  on durable goods inventor ies for manufacturing confirmed that this morning.  It is probably the case that motor vehicle inventories did rise in 80 of 126significant inventory accumulation, and in a way that’s probably good rather than bad because we’re looking forward to an acceleration.  Purchasing managers at manufacturing firms, who are probably best positioned to have a sense of whether their customers’ inventories are high or low, are reporting that they are extr aordinarily low.  Since all inve ntories by definition are produced by manufacturers, with the exception of a few items  in mining, lumber, and the like, these people are very focused on the process.  Basically they are saying that th e inventory situation is getting tighter and tighter.  So there’s an  upside risk here, which is something we have not seen for quite a substantial period of time.   If the economy starts to heat  up, obviously we’re going to have  to create a credible exit strategy from maintaining an accommodative stance fo r a considerable period.  We have a lot of alternatives, and maybe that’s pa rt of the problem.  We may have just too many widgets to push and too many permutations and combinations with ni neteen people to get any single set of views.   I think we could remind the market that we first used the term “accommodative” in early 2002 when we moved the funds rate down to 1.75 pe rcent.  Bob Parry has raised that issue publicly.  He got a lot of attention.  [Laught er]  Anything that anybody on this Committee says gets a lot of attention, largely because the truth of  the matter is that we are in uncharted waters.  In our personal experiences we ha ve never been at a point when th e inflation rate for all practical purposes is zero.  We have reached price stability.  In previous periods when the economy was turning and inflation rates were 3, 4, or 5 percent, a preemptive polic y move made a lot of sense.  But what are we preempting from wh en inflation is effectively at zero?  What that means is that we have a lot of time to sit and watch the proc ess going forward.  But as Ben Bernanke pointed out, one possible explanation of wh at the markets are doing is that  they are merely replicating our past behavior, which is called backward-looking analysis.  I think that’s right.  That’s what 81 of 126begins to show far greater signs of underlying strength and sustainability.  We’re going to have to work our way through to determining where we need to be on the funds rate. I ought to emphasize that we have a number  of ways of doing that.  Obviously, the accommodation issue can be redefined.  We can retu rn to an assessment of balanced inflation risks.  We can say that the risks to sustainable growth are on the upside.  Or we can rephrase how we state the balance of risks.  And we can make all of the adjustments with different timing.  For example, there’s no reason that we  cannot start raising the short-term  funds rate and still have the next sentence of our statement indicate that we will remain accommodative for a considerable period of time.  Or we can decide to drop that statement at the first stage. But let me emphasize this:  The bottom line is that we should ha ve the policy that is the right policy.  If we actually a llow this whole question of who says what and how the press will read it—whether it’s up, down, or sidewa ys—to affect our judg ment regarding the implementation of the optimum policy, we are maki ng a very bad mistake.  The people out there who are in either the cheering or the booing sect ion know less than we do, and they demonstrate that periodically.  Whenever I suspect otherwise they dissuade me!  [Laughter] So the first thing we have to do is to deci de what we want to do.  Then as a wholly If we intermix these two issues, we’re making a ve ry bad mistake.  If we allow the movement in rates to reflect how we expect markets to respond , we’re going to find that we all presumed that if we move X the markets will respond Y, but in fact when we move X the markets will do something else.  We can’t be sure how the mark ets will respond.  There is no solution to that 82 of 126dilemma.  In my view, we have to keep that  in mind in the discussion we’re going to have shortly.  We have to separate  policy from communication.   Having said that, we do have to determine wh at we want to say in our press statement after we decide what we want to do on polic y.  I agree with those around the table who have cautioned against doing anything si gnificantly different today.  I say that because I have no idea how the markets will respond.  I know everyone has his or her own view about that, and I appreciate that.  But anybody who says he has a clue about how the market will react is in my judgment expressing a lack of knowledge.  As far as I’m concerned, the policy issue today is straightforward.  I think there’s no issue with respect to the appropriate policy.  Policy is actually working well.  It’s hard to remember this, but not too long ago we were looking at the possibility of an awesome downside on the inflation rate, and we weren’t sure  we had the tools to deal with it.  We know exactly what to do on the upside.  We may not get it right, but we know what to do.  As a consequence, we may have looked at the Greenbook forecast six months ago and asked what Dave Stockton was smoking.  Well, whatever it was, it was pretty good!  [Laughter] My bottom line is that at this stage we have to make minor adjustments in the first paragraph.  We can’t talk about weak labor markets; we need to say we ’re in a period where they’ve stabilized or something like that.  But I’ d just leave the rest of  the wording alone and ship it out and go work on something else.  That is my recommendation, and I’d be interested in your reactions.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I support you co mpletely.  Since we’re into metaphors today, here’s mine.  With regard to the co mmunication part of your recommendation, with the second paragraph I think we have dug ourselves into  a hole and we’re trying very hard to get out 83 of 126of it but all we’re doing is getti ng in deeper.  Let’s put the shov el down, think about it, and climb out of this hole later.  That’s why I’ d say leave the paragraph exactly the same. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pool e, what do we do about the shovel?  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I was going to comment that I think the minutes that will come out on Thursday are going to help a lot.  On page 14 there’s some important la nguage that emphasizes that the “considerable period” has to be interp reted in the context of  the evolution of the economy, not in the context of calendar time.  I belie ve that language is going to help to get us to a much better position in the future.  I would also note that there’s an old saying that the best tax system is an old tax system.  I think that’s pr obably true of communication strategy as well.  We need to develop a standard strategy.  If we’re goi ng to be reviewing our communication policy at some length later, it’s best not to have a whole series of changes along the way until we complete our review.  In the meantime, we should let the issue sit as quietly as possible. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I meant to say that , and I don’t think I sa id it explicitly.  We really ought to have the simulated exit strate gy spelled out in full detail before we take the first step.  We have to know where we want to  end up under various conditions so that we don’t find ourselves as perpetual ditch diggers.  President Broaddus.

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  The wording is on page 10 of the Bluebook continuing onto page 11:  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks moneta ry and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in  output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks condi tions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate  at an average of around 1 percent.”  With regard to the risk-assessment language, “Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the informati on currently available, the Committee believes the risks to its outlook for sustainable econom ic growth over the next several quarters are balanced.  The risks to its outlook for inflation over the next several quarters are weighted toward the downside.  And taken together, the ba lance of risks to its objectives is weighted toward the downside in the foreseeable future.”

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Our next meeti ng is Tuesday, December 9. Excuse me, I forgot to mention that there’s essentially no change in the press statement.  Now, what’s your pleasure with regard to the disc ussion on communications?  Do you want to talk over lunch or do you want to recess and come back? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  What I propose, Mr. Chairm an, is for everybody to go get lunch and come back to the table.  When everyone settles down, I can read some brief remarks, and then we can proceed with the discussion.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay, that sounds good.  Is that satisfactory to everybody?  Good, let’s go to lunch.   [Lunch break] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let’s turn to Vincent Reinhart. MR. REINHART.3  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the material called “Briefing on FOMC Communications Policy” th at Carol Low handed out while you were getting lunch.  One of my  favorite quotes, which offers some perspective on my work on the Committee =s communication policy over the past few months, comes from William of Orange, w ho held that “you need not hope to undertake nor succeed to persevere.”  Wh en it comes to the structure of the Committee’s assessment of the outlook, I can  report to the members that your Secretary has undertaken and persevered but sees little hope of su ccess.  To raise the odds just a bit, I would appreciate it if you would use the time until 2:00 p.m. to provide some feedback on a few key issues.  To facilitate that discussion, I have listed in  the first exhibit some alternative ways of assessing risks.  I started with the pre- March balance-of-risks language to establish that some progress in the Committee’s co mmunication has been made.  The second                                                  3 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). 87 of 126panel gives the current wording, the next is the proposal in my memo dated same time.  These panels are for your reference.  What I will focus on are the four questions listed in exhibit 2.  In particular , do you have a clear preference for the risk assessment among the various proposals that have circulated?  If there is a basic structure identified today, then the task of homing in on specific language will be easier.    Second, in that process it would be help ful if the Committee provided guidance as to whether it wants a bilatera l or a multilateral approach to arriving at new language.  By that I mean that I can get feedback fr om the members indivi dually and iterate on new drafting language or I can look for opportunities to schedule a discussion of these matters by the full Committee.  A middle gr ound would be to c onsider charging a subcommittee with the task, but only a few members have expressed enthusiasm for that.    Third, how much importance do you place on wrapping up this issue quickly?  Many of you have expressed concurrence with postponing the adoption of new language, often with the comment that you’ d rather have it do ne right than done quickly.  A countervailing considerati on, however, is the observation that the economy seems to be improving, perhaps at a pace that would make you anticipate changing at least some part of the risk assessm ent in the near future.  If so, there is a question of sequencing.  Do you want to  grapple with modifying the existing language to express a new tilt, or would such  a transition be an appropriate time to adopt a new structure?  Fourth, when do you want to talk about this  next?  Looking at the calendar, there are three immediate opportunities.  I coul d set aside time on the December 9 agenda after the policy decision to consider the matter, and you could decide perhaps not to be bound by the 2:00 p.m. deadline.  I coul d arrange a dinner meeting on December 8, the night before that meeting.  Third, this could be the subject of the discussion on the Tuesday afternoon of your next two-day meeti ng in late January.  With any of those options, though, you might want to take into  consideration how the public will react to news that the Committee is once again ta lking about communications, especially if you are not certain that the conversation will bring closure, at least for now.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don’t you put each question on the table and ask for comments. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  The first ques tion is, Is there any clear preference as to the basic structure of the assessment of the outlook?   88 of 126

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Mr. Chairman, before we ta lk about that, could I say a word about my draft wording? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Certainly. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  As I’ve said before, I’v e not fancied myself a communications expert, so I do this a bit reluct antly.  But the thing I’m increasingly having trouble with in our statements is that our assessments of the econom y are not benchmarked.  As I said in my memo, the phrase “sustainable growth” sometimes seems to mean that the econo my is growing at the normal rate, but that growth could be associated  with any unemployment rate.  Sometimes the term means closing the output gap.  In the top paragraph on page 10 of the Bluebook, Vincent actually says that if the “sus tainable economic growth” sentence means this, then one thing follows, and if the sentence means something else , then another thing follows.  We’re dealing with enough uncertainties here without having un certainty about what our own language means.  I think we could clearly do better.  With regard  to inflation, describing it as rising or falling doesn’t help me.  I’d like to see our assessment of inflation comp ared with some desirable level.  So I have suggested a version that attempts to put in benchmarks.  That’s all it does; I tried to stick with the rest of the language as much  as possible.  I have received a lot of favorable comment on this by e-mail, though I won’t say fro m whom.  You can speak for yourselves today, but I think there’s a lot of  interest in this.  I was about to o ffer to host a donor’s conference to see if we could get the language on this right.  But it  may be that Vincent’s procedural steps will take care of that, and I’m happy to turn this back over to the staff.  However, I think a key issue is whether the Committee wants to benchmark the assessment of the economy.  I very much do. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think we have to be  a little careful here because there is a prerequisite to this discussi on that we don’t talk about, name ly how much can we rationally 89 of 126expect monetary policy to do.  If we believe that  monetary policy has the capability of affecting the economy incrementally in all sorts of ways—to create whatever level of unemployment, GDP growth, and inflation we choose—and we ca n implement policies that will accomplish such objectives, then I can see announcing very explicit target levels.  My problem with that type of policy commitment is that it promises far more th an monetary policy has the capacity to deliver.  We have to be very careful about what we set up as  our goals; we need to make sure that they are reachable goals.  If we say, for example, that our goal is to get the unemployment rate down to 4.6 percent with a growth rate in  GDP that would close the output  gap by X percent or something like that, that’s all well and good.  But do we actually have the capacity to accomplish that?  My answer is that we most certainly do not.  Now,  if indeed the e-mails you’re getting come from members who believe that we can, that’s an import ant issue.  We have to  stay within the bounds of what we believe this Committee can do, and I just  want to make sure th at that is explicitly recognized before we go further. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  May I respond to  that?  I think th e issue is not whether we get to full employment in some reasonable period but how our  policy is structured given the way we see output relative to some objective.  I see the issue as how best to sa y that we are trying to work in a direction of expansion or contraction, whic hever the case may be, but not in any sense promising that we would achieve a goal.  And I’d be perfectly symmetric w ith inflation.  I would say that we see inflation above the level we c onsider desirable or below it, and therefore our policy is X.  So I don’t think this approach contai ns a promise that we will get to a goal.  But I believe we can illuminate our actions by specifying the direction toward which we are working and how we are trying to influence the economy.  That is frankly what I do in making decisions 90 of 126when I come to our meetings.  If that’s what I do—and I think that’s wh at most of you do—then it seems to me that we ought to be able to talk about it in those terms. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Indeed, I think ev eryone does that because we all have our own objectives and hence when we vote we make policy decisions based on those objectives.  Implicitly we all do that, or else we would not be able to come to a conclusion.  What I’m arguing against is the cap acity of the members of this Committ ee to have a similar view on all of the goals. We really can’t achieve that sort of unanimity—a majority determines it—because each individual member has to be free to ma ke a final judgment on the basis of whatever conceptual framework he or she has with respect to the economy.  If  we all had the same conceptual framework, I will acknowledge that  the proposition you are arguing would enhance our transparency.  But frankly, knowing all the members of this Committee, I think we’d have trouble getting a philosophical agreement among all nineteen people on how the economy works to the degree that is required to formulate moneta ry policy.  I’d say that would be very difficult.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  First, I want to start with a quote, go on to make some points, and then answer Vincent’s question.  Vincent opened with a quote from William of Orange, and I’ll start with one from Winston Chur chill, who said that in matters of communication “victory is never final, and defeat is never fatal.”  So I wa nt to encourage us to keep going because whatever happens we will not get to the end point.   Second, I come from a background in consulting, and one of the first things I learned in consulting was to define the nature of the problem.  That leads me to discuss a little survey that I found.  The question was, Does the Fed disclose enough information about interest rate policy?  Thirty-four percent of the res pondents said that they felt we ll informed; another 34 percent 91 of 126answered “yes, there was enough information but it was a little too confusing”; 27 percent said the Fed is “too secretive”; and a surprising 5 percent said that the Fed provided too much information.  I don’t suggest that this survey wa s scientific and, obviously, if it didn’t support my point of view I wouldn’t have brought it up!  [La ughter]  But the reason I ra ised it is that I think we have to be very careful here.  Although we’v e suffered criticism, boos as well as cheers, I’m not so sure that we need a dramatic change in  our communications.  We need a change for sure, but I’m not convinced that we need a dramatic change that may again throw the markets into uncertainty about what we’re tryi ng to do.  I would caution us, as we go through this exercise, to recognize that our communication po licy is not perfect by any stretc h of imagination but it’s not completely broken.  So I would encourage us to th ink about incremental changes, if you will.   That said, let me get to the answer to Vin cent’s first question regarding a clear preference as to the basic structure of our statement.  On this I pick up from where Tony Santomero was in the early part of the meeting.  I believe it would be very helpful in the forward-looking part of our statement for us to separate the two issues that are now combined.  One part would literally be an indication of how we think the economy is likely to evolve or change—whether we think growth is picking up or slowing down and whether inflation is picking up or slowing down.  That would involve just a factual statement, if you will.  The second part would give some sort of value judgment or welfare assessment, whatever th e term may be.  I think whoever said that the nine-box matrix in the Bluebook seems to combine those two concepts was right.  In my view our communication needs to disentangle them.  One of the weaknesse s in the earlier risk assessment—it had several weaknesses that we di scovered over time—was that too many things were entangled into a relatively sm all number of words.  So in term s of my preference as to the 92 of 126structure, I’d like a structure that clearly breaks out our sense of the outlook as a factual statement versus the value judgm ent relating to our goals.   A second preference I have is to avoid language that is too precise in  terms of specifying a variety of goals or targets.  We don’t have collectively a well-stated goal on unemployment, for example.  I’m not sure we all share the same point of view regarding potential.  We don’t necessarily have the same point of view about the desirable level of inflation.  We all think it should be low, obviously—probably in a range be tween 1 and 2 percent on certain measures—but we don’t have a target that is well defined by the Committee.  So I’d be quite cautious about going too far down the path toward language that im plies that we have specific targets or that forces us to continue to answ er questions about what  exactly our goals are or what we deem acceptable.  I think we have to maintain some vagueness in that regard. The third rule I’d have in my preferences as to the structure is that it be stress-tested, perhaps using some of the nine boxes in the ma trix approach that Vi ncent suggested in his memo.  One of the problems with the earlier language was that, alt hough we did attempt to stress-test it, we didn’t fores ee a period with a large output ga p, inflation falling, and growth rising dramatically above potential.  So the tradeoffs that were built into the old balance of risks, though they lasted for about three years, didn’t last into the mo st recent period.  I won’t blame the previous director of Monetary  Affairs for this!  [Laughter]  It would inappropriate to do such a thing.  But let the record show that he’s nodding his head, supporting my comments in one way or the other!  In any event, I do think that we need to take some more  time and do some stress testing.   That said, for reasons the Chairman alluded t o, I must say that I was drawn to Vincent’s language in his memo of October  22 as an approach that perhaps could work.  The last thing I’d 93 of 126say about my preferences, having gone through this three-year period or so with the statement structured the way it is now, is that if we do make another change , we need to recognize that it probably won’t be the last change.  So I th ink we really should be aiming at enough stress testing—and maybe it’s implied in the stress testing—to al low us to stay with the new language for longer than a three-year pe riod.  We may never succeed in doing that, but the goal of stress testing is to think of as many potential permutations as possible.   I thought Vincent’s nine boxes did that to a large degree.  So that’s my answer  to the first question in terms of preferences.  I have these two or three preferen ces, recognizing as I said that we’re not in a horrifically bad position, though obviously we do need to continue  to move forward on communication issues.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman, I don’t have a quote, but I am reminded of a life experience, which was the first time I ate a raw oy ster.  Somebody forgot to tell me to let it slide down.  Instead, I began to chew on the darn thing, and the more you chew on an oyster the tougher it gets to swallow.   I might have been closer to be ing ready to make some judgments on communication issues at our dinner meeting last month than I am now.   If anything, it has become clearer to me that this subject is very complicated.  There are more options.  Ned’s ideas are fascinating but raise some new questions.  The discussion today raises still more.  So I’m not close to being ready this afternoon to start choosing. I may be in the minority in this view, but desp ite the fact that we’v e already talked about this issue and some ideas are on the table, I’m not sure each of us has really had a chance to put our best ideas on the table.  I don’t think we can do that in a one-hour dinner meeting, and I don’t think we can do that in a one-hour  session at an FOMC meeting.  So if we can get by until the 94 of 126senior staff to get everybody’s be st ideas and sort through the op tions to a point where we can effectively work with them.  That  would give us some time to th ink this out more carefully, and we could devote a whole afternoon to discuss it thoroughly at our Ja nuary meeting and try to get it as right as we possibly can.  I think we’d be best served if we  took that kind of time and care to try to sort some of this out.  It has go tten very complicated.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I more or less share the view that President Guynn expressed.  One of the things I did in preparatio n for this discussion was to go back to the press release that we used in January 2000.  After some considerable thought, the Committee—rightly or wrongly—put that wording together.  It worked very well as far as I’m concerned.  Then some special circumstances came up, and we made cha nges in that wording.  They served their purpose but now we have some fallout from that.  We ought to go back to the earlier language as a starting point—not to the language we’re now using, which was put toge ther ad hoc piece-by-piece, but back to the base.  Let’s think it thr ough and see what we need to modify in that language.  If it makes sense, I’d keep the structure as close to that earlie r version as possible and then move forward.  I would not try to figure out wording today or choose now among several options.  I don’t feel comfortabl e with any of them.  I’d feel reasonably comfortable with what we had before with some changes to reflect that we’re in a more stable price environment.  So I agree with Jack.  Maybe circumstances are changing too quickly, and we can’t wait until January.  But we ought to wait at least until D ecember, think this through more carefully, and come up with some options or na rrow our options at that point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry. 95 of 126

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  At the last meeting I came away with the impr ession that what we seemed to agree on was that the directiv e wording and the risk  assessment we voted on should be what we communicated to the public.  It was important to many of us—maybe to all of us—that the communication directly reflect our vo te.  Is it naive, Vincent, to think that we could focus on the directive wording and the risk assessment, which we didn’t seem to have too much trouble agreeing to and voting on today, and find a way for that language to be what we release?  How long did it take us to agree on that wording today—two nanoseconds? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Although what you agreed on formally were instructions to the drafters of the statement.  I think in the proposal—  

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  What we agreed on is what  is going to appear in the minutes. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  What Normand read was from the page in the Bluebook. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

 MR REINHART.  That isn’t identical to what is in today’s press release for the following reason— 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Oh, I know that. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This is a minor issue because we can readily do what Bob is saying in that context. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  The proposal was that, when you decide on a risk assessment, what you vote on would be what appears in the directiv e.  I think everyone ag reed to that.  The problem for this meeting operationally was that, if you decided to adopt language that differs from what you used at the last  meeting, we would not have known what the alternative would be. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Okay.  Isn’t the goal to get the language in the vote and the press release the same?  Why should that be so difficult?  Based on what I’ve read in the last couple of weeks, 96 of 126it’s extremely difficult.  I don’t understand why.  Maybe we need an English teacher or grammarian. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  No maybe about that! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The trouble is th at, when you run into a problem, you tend to add adjectives and adverbs to any statement.  

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Yes, I noticed. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And it becomes the oyster that Jack’s been chewing on!  [Laughter]  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I agree with Jack that we need to do some hard background work and have an extended session in January to review where we want to go on this.  One dimension of this on the table is the issue that Ned raised at the ou tset having to do with objectives and whether we can usefully sharpen that language .  I think another very important dimension that we need to address is the extent to which we want to foresh adow or hint about the future policy direction.  My own view is that whenever we regard the risks as unbalanced—I’ll sa y seriously unbalanced just to make my point clear—we should move th e funds rate right away.  We should move it at the meeting when we recognize or make an assessment that the risks are seriously unbalanced.  So my preference would be that we use the bala nced risk assessment as the explanation for why the adjustment did not take place at the current meeting and that we never have an unbalanced risk assessment going forward—or at least not se riously unbalanced.  If the risks were that unbalanced, my position is that we already would have adjusted po licy.  At any rate, I consider this an important dimension that we need to focus on.  I don’t think we can come up with the appropriate language around the tabl e today in a situation like this but that’s anot her aspect of our communication policy that  we must spend time on. 97 of 126

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  May I ask President Poole a question? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Sure. MR. FERGUSON.  I agree with you, but do you not foresee a period where the risks could be unbalanced but not so unbalanced that the Committee felt it had to move immediately?  In such a situation the tilt is not a hint about policy, but a sense— and this is what I think we’ve been doing for two years—that the risks are weig hted in a certain dire ction though we’re not so strong in our conviction that we f eel we need to move policy.  

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Obviously ther e’s a whole continuum here. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Right. MR. POOLE.  I understand that, of course.  My  concern is that making a statement that the risks are unbalanced and yet not wanting that to be interpreted as a hint about the probable direction of policy is a very diffi cult language act to pull off.  I think the market routinely views the unbalanced risk assessment as a hint about or  at least some probabili ty regarding the future direction of policy. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  I think that’s true. MR. POOLE.  I’m uncomfortable doing that  because my view is that the policy adjustments are primarily driven by surprises or by the new informa tion that we can’t predict.  That’s why I believe that providing these hints causes problems more than it helps.  I’m just saying that that’s somethi ng we need to discuss. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Right. MR. POOLE.  We need to reach some agreemen t on that.  I’m not trying to say that we can come to an agreement here today.  But I think some people want to provide that hint about 98 of 126the likely direction of policy.  I did when I firs t came here.  But I’ve ch anged my mind in living through issuing these statements as to whether or  not those hints are really constructive.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bernanke. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m  happy to wait until January if that’s what people want to do.  I would like to e xpress a mild preference—more than a mild preference—for Governor Gramlich’s formulation.  I think it’s important to have benchmarks.  Our current statement and both of the suggested statements have benchmarks in the terms “sustainable growth,” “unwelcome,”  “desirably lower,” or “desirably higher.”  So that’s not the question; all of the versions have benchmarks .  I like Governor Gramlich’s formulation better because his benchmark for output is not whether it is growing above or below the growth rate of potential but that it has a trajectory that leads eventually toward full employment. That is a different concept, but that’s rea lly what we should be shooting for.  I think that’s a better way of thinking about our objective.  I understand Gove rnor Ferguson’s comment about breaking the forecast and the evaluation into two parts.  But in fact the statement suggested by Vincent does not do that because the forecast for output includes  a reference to sustainable growth.  There is explicitly a benchmark for grow th, symmetrically, but there shoul d be a benchmark for inflation in that same paragraph.  To make matters more complicated, I might note th at I just came from the Bank of England, and they don’t issue any st atement at all immediately after their policy meeting.  They’re very happy releasing the minutes  a couple of weeks afte r the meeting because they think that document conveys  all the subtleties of their discussion much better than a statement. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Actually, that opti on should be on the table.  Where I have a problem with what you’re saying is this.  The notion that disinflation is unwelcome at this 99 of 126desirable level of unemployment is X, then that’s in the same category.  If we can stipulate that we agree on the desirable level for every one of the goals, what you’re suggesting can work.  I’m basically saying that we’re not going to achieve that.  And to try to do it when it’s patently unattainable I think will waste a lot of the Committee’s time.  It’s not that in  principle it’s bad.  I just think it’s utterly una chievable.  Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I certainly agree that we need to clarify the language, and we’re not going to get it done today.  We could ve ry well make it until next I started by asking what our goal was, and I think I took off from where President Poole was in a sense but came to the opposite conclusion.  I thought our goal was to help people better anticipate where interest rates might go.  By giving them a little in formation as to what we were worried about, we might help them anticipate our actions a little better.  I don’t think all of our actions are keyed to new information, new shocks.  Sometimes we’re at positions where we think we’re more likely to do one thing than another because of how we see the economy developing, and it’s helpful to the markets to tell them that.  So this is about changes in interest rates and the likely movement of interest rates.  Also, cons istent with what President Hoenig was saying, I think that was what the subcommittee was trying to do—as ill-served as it might have been by the then director of Monetary Affairs.  We were trying to look at changes in the output gaps and in the inflation gaps that would then lead to ch anges in interest rates.  That leads me to the Reinhart language, which to me is in that same sp irit.  I agree it doesn’t have benchmarks in it.  That to me is a separable issue.  In my view we don’t need to tell pe ople what our benchmarks 100 of 126are to help them see where interest rates might go in the future.  We might want to tell them our benchmarks, but I think that’s a separate debate.   When I looked at Ned’s version, I did try to  do some stress testing on it.  Perhaps I misread it, but it talks about the probability that  economic growth will proceed over the next few quarters at a rate consistent with the attainme nt of maximum sustainabl e employment.  Then it says that “over the same period” the probability that inflation will be undesirably high is below, equal to, or above the probability that it will be  undesirably low.  That implies that the time reference for inflation is the next  few quarters and to me that was much too short a time frame.  I asked myself if I answered “equal” to both of  those parts—that I thought we would be at maximum employment in a few quarters, and infl ation would be equal to  or above a desirable level—what would I be doing with interest rates in that situatio n?  I think I would be raising interest rates if I believed we  would be at 5 percent unemployment some time next year—or at least I would be preparing the markets for that po ssibility.  Now, in a pr ivate conversation with Governor Gramlich he informed me that I wasn ’t reading his words right.  But the only time reference in his formulation is “over the next few quarters.”  If we mean over the next few years, I think we need to say that; otherwise it implies that monetary policy will not be stabilizing but will promote overshooting.  I just think the benchmark issue is a separate issue.  We don’t really need to do benchmarks to accomplish what we set out to accomplish a few years ago.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus. MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, the first th ing I would say is, Jack, when you eat an oyster you really ought to chew it.  That’s what br ings the flavor out.  [Laughter]  When I think about communication, to me what makes a comm unication good is that it’ s direct, clear, and 101 of 126understandable.  On that score, Ned’s suggested word ing has a lot to offer.  It’s direct, and of the alternatives that we’re consid ering today, I think it is in so me sense the clearest and most understandable.  It also has an accountability dimension to it, and I like that.  I find the benchmark attractive.  The one issue, Ned—and we talked about this a litt le before—is that the use of employment as a benchmark concept is something I have to think about.  I would have to get more comfortable with that.  I’ve spent a lot of time over my career arguing for a price stability mandate.  I know I’m pushing my luck here, but in that regard if we had a more explicit target—or let me say a firmer inflation anchor —I could be more comfortable with something like Ned’s proposed language.  I think it could wor k.  That’s about where I am on the alternatives we have before us.   I agree with Jack and Tom that we need to th ink this through carefull y.  We need to take whatever time is necessary.  Certainly we can wait until January; I think the language we have now will be satisfactory until then.  The other point I would add is that, once we make a decision, the decision itself may warrant a more promin ent announcement than we’ve typically made when we’ve made changes in the past.  We may wa nt to release an extended press statement that lays out the reasoning as to why, for the forese eable future, we are going to use this new language.  If we are a little more communicative on that score than us ual, I think that would help.  That’s where I am. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  In preparation for this discussion I reread the verbat im transcript of our dinner meeting last month.  It was very interestin g and informative.  I realized how much I miss sometimes when I’m thinking about what I want to say as opposed to what other people are saying.  I was one of the people who at that time did not want to change much in our statement 102 of 126and for the near term I’m still in that camp.  But I’ve come around a lot, to somewhere near where President Poole is, and I certainly agree w ith Presidents Guynn and Hoenig that we need to give this a lot more thought.  We definitely have to say what we did and why we did it.  And in saying why we took whatever action we did, we ought to give some sense of the things that concern us about the current out look.  I really question—I’m so rry, Don—the assumption that it helps the markets at all for us to go further th an that and talk about  the risks of various developments in the future.  I’m not sure it help s them.  I think it just gives them more to chew on in terms of what we said, why we said it, and who said what, and they think about that rather than doing their job in the market.  They shoul dn’t be spending as much time second-guessing us as they are.  They should be out there doi ng whatever it is markets do.  [Laughter]  

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  But we’re the 800-pound gorilla in the market. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Well, I know we’re the 800-p ound gorilla, but I think we should avoid a commitment about the future.  We should clear ly avoid any sense—and somehow try to correct the belief—that we sit around this table trying to figure out what the markets are likely to do and what we’re going to say to make them do somethi ng different.  The markets are going to do what they’re going to do.  We have to make our policy th e way we call the cards.  We may be right, or we may be wrong; but we should not be maki ng policy—or even talking about policy—that’s aimed at changing how the markets operate.  They have to operate a bit independently of us, I think.  So in the short term I think we did the right thing toda y.  Between now and January we probably will be coming to an appreciation of the risks being more balanced.  That will change the language.  That will help us get out of th e “considerable period” terminology.  In January—my personal preference is to take a real step b ack and think long and hard  about what the risk statement does for us.  If we’re convinced that  it does something good, then we have any number 103 of 126of formulations of language to go with.  If we’re  not convinced, then maybe we can find a way to tell the markets that they will find out what we  did and why, but we’re going to stop speculating on the risks.  I don’t care if we use a task force in the interim.  That’s fine by me. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  Well, working backward, I also  would be in favor of taking our time on this because I do think it’s important.  I don’t think we have any reason to rush.  I found the Gramlich memo appealing but for a reason that I ha ven’t heard stated, and that is that maximum sustainable employment and low inflation are our public policy ma ndate.  Those of us who have been through the confirmation process were reminded of that in our confirmation hearings.  I didn’t look at the transcripts of the recent hearings; but I suspect that, if Senator Sarbanes or some others were there, the nominees may well have been reminded of that dual mandate.  I don’t see those objectives as requ iring a benchmark of any more numeric specificity than what we now have.   I was involved in an exercise about a year ago with President Br oaddus and others in which we reviewed our strategic direction.  When we talked about the monetary policy role, we came back to that congressional mandate as the starting point.  So from that perspective, Governor Gramlich’s wording appeals to me.  Also, I suspect that the Federal Reserve Act will not change significantly over the next  few years, so it seems to me that, if we have that as the starting point, it’s also likely that  we could stay with such a form at.  I’m also an incrementalist, and I think we should not make a lot of changes.  That’s a component of the Gramlich memo that I find particularly appealing. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But he goes far beyond what you just said. MR. OLSON.  Does he? 104 of 126

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  He has specific number s.  We just voted on instructions to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in whic h we used exactly the kind of language you’re talking about.  In fact that happe ns to be an issue on which we all agree.  So we can use that sort of language.  But I think Ned is trying to get so mething more specific than that.  He’s trying to put in hard numbers or get something more conc lusive than a vague notion of what is maximum sustainable growth.  If we all agreed on what th at number was, then we could do it.  But that’s not going to happen. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  I guess I didn’t read it that way.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Ned, am I misinterpreting what you said? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I think so. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, then  tell me what I’ve said wrong. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I don’t see anything in here that commits us to any specific goal on either the inflation side or the unemployment si de.  This actually replaces the statement that growth has to proceed at a stable rate.  All it says is that growth is proceeding at a rate that in our view is consistent with the eventual—and ma ybe we ought to put in the word “eventual”—attainment of maximum sustainabl e employment.  I don’t think we ha ve to say what that level of employment is, and I don’t think we have to give an inflation target.  We could, as Al suggested.  But the way the statement is written I don’t think we have to.  I intentio nally wrote it in a way that we could avoid giving specific numerical targets. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, the question is whether in fact in the real world that is capable of being achieved. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Yes, that’s an is sue.  Believe me, I understand that. 105 of 126

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay, I withdraw my negative comment.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I’ll make a different negative comment then, Mr. Chairman.  I am concerned about having a maximum sustainable empl oyment objective.  I don’ t really mean that it’s not an objective—obviously we all agree that it’s in the statute—but I would not put it in the statement.  I find it difficult to envision a circ umstance in which we would ever want to say publicly that economic growth will proceed over the next few quarters at a rate above that consistent with the attainment of  maximum sustainable employment if the latter is falling short of our objective.  I don’t think we ’re ever going to want to say we ’re against more employment.  It puts us in a very awkward position, quite frankl y.  I think the term “growth” has served us well over many years, and I personally like the term “gro wth” better here.  Also, I used to work in the Labor Department, so I’m very sensitive to the employment and unemployment part of our mandate.   Let me turn to the process side, which is the subject I really wanted to make most of my comments on.  I think we’ve had some very good suggestions today.  As I view this going forward, it is worth looking carefully  to see if we can craft langua ge that we’re comfortable with that would be a formulaic approach, which is essen tially what we have now.  I’d prefer a formula where there are a certain number of  options and we pick one at each  meeting.  I think we want to change the language, although it’s going to be di fficult to do given the differences of opinion.  But it would make our decision on the language a lo t easier at each meeting if we could find a formulaic approach.  I think it’s worth the effort, and I like the idea of ha ving a task force that will come back to us with some options or recommendations.  I also agree that the other option 106 of 126that we discussed before and rejected, namely the earlier release of the minutes, is another approach that we should consider.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That would solve a lot of problems. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  That’s right; and we could just  drop this language completely.  I think it’s worth seeing what the logistics of an early release of  the minutes really are.  We talked about that possibility, and I know it w ould put a lot of pressure on the Board staff to draft the document and on all of us to review it.  But I think it’s worth going through a timeline in detail to see what would be involved, and we can determine if we ar e willing to commit to getting the minutes out in two weeks or three weeks or whatever the appropriate interv al would happen to be.  I don’t think we can do what we need to do on these communication issues around this table with nineteen people.  In my view, we ought to have a separate group work on it and come back with recommendations.  I think that group has to get input from everyone on the Committee so that each of us has a chance to convey our views.  We’re probably going to have to have several discussions as a Committee on ce that group reports to us. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The obvious problem  is that if we release the minutes earlier we’ll find that the whol e Committee is going to want to get involved in editing them. Theoretically, in my judgment, earlier publication of the minutes is the ideal solution to our communication dilemma if we could find a way to en sure that we can produce a document that is comparable in terms of quality to what we do now.  I don’t know what types of comments Vincent gets on the draft minutes.  But looking at the changes, there ar e very few.  If that indeed is the kind of document we would get two week s after the meeting, we could consider it the major vehicle for communication.  I think the valu e of that is overwhelming compared with our 107 of 126mincing the language the way we’re trying to min ce it in our press release.  Maybe we ought to think of a way to do that.   

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  We have to address the issue of whether we would get the same kind of product as we do now. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, that’s correct .  That’s the issue.  Nevertheless, the minutes are not bad now.  I think they do de scribe conceptually what we are doing. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Mr. Chairman, in answer to President Moskow’s question, I would make one observation.  The Bank of England is th e model for this approach, and they get their minutes out in two weeks.  They also have th e advantage that everybody in  the policy group is in the same building, so they sit down and devote a ha lf-day to editing the minutes line by line.  The original assumption with regard to the Janua ry discussion on communications was that we’d have this issue of the statement behind us by then.  Our intention was to talk in January about the early release of the minutes and an expanded use of the central tendency forecast.  The forecast would have a big role in the process because the forecast appears in the minutes and if the minutes are out earlier, the forecas t will be, too.  The staff is prep aring two documents related to that.  Right now the communica tion agenda is rather crow ded, and any guidance as to sequencing would be helpful. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If we could fi nd a way to group the members into a constant alignment of similarly minded pe ople, each group could assign one person as a representative to the editing committee.  Then we could have a small group of people sitting around editing.  I wouldn’t suggest that that’s about to happen. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I think your next Secretar y, Mr. Chairman, will have a challenge.  [Laughter] 108 of 126

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Would the proposal be not to ha ve any statement afte r a meeting even if we change policy?  Would we let everything ride until we publish the minutes?  If we’re going to have a statement anyway, we’re still going to have a struggle with the wording of a statement.  

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I would drop the balance of risk part and have the statement be only this first paragraph regarding what we’ve done. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We’d stipulate what action we took. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Well, that’s eas y, if there’s no explanation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There’s going to be an explanation, two or three sentences. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  There will be an explanati on but not a balance of risks statement. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Yes, we’ll have just the fi rst paragraph of the press release but not the second paragraph. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. MR. GRAMLICH.  By the way, as author of the eloquent version of the second paragraph, I would be perfectly happy to have that all supplanted by the minutes if there is a way to do it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, we r eally ought to explore that.   

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  We are preparing a docum ent on the early release of the minutes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don’t you try to do the minutes earlier for this particular meeting?  [Laughter]  This is the easiest meeting for which you’ll be able to do minutes.  It will give you the baseline of how close you can get to an actual implementation of the early release option. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Is this th e stress test?  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Of whom? 109 of 126

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Count the years to retirement, Vincent! 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The minutes could say, “Fo llowing lunch, a vigorous discussion ensued with respect to communications.”  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We’re running out of allocated time at this particular moment.  May I suggest, in orde r to move this process forwar d, that in conjunction with the Secretariat, we will appoint a committee of Governors and Pr esidents—an estimable group if they wish to join—and see whether or not we can at least narrow th is down.  We actually narrowed it down some today.  It  appeared to me that, if we could find a way to solve the problem of drafting and editing th e minutes more quickly, that so lution of releasing the minutes earlier would carry the day in this Committee.  Am I correct in that? 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Yes. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But there are prob lems in doing that.  Maybe we can learn some things from the British experience and find a mechanism that will enable us to succeed in accomplishing that.  One possibility—I'm just throwi ng ideas out in the air—is that at the late basically would be charged with the drafting requirements of the minutes.  The interesting point about that is that to make it work we cannot go back to the full FOMC for a decision on the minutes because if that happens then it become s a wholly indeterminate process.  I’m just throwing out that possibility.  There has to be so me constraint on the exercise of democracy in this group if we’re going to achieve this goal.  The question is what constraints we are willing to impose on ourselves.  Currently we all have the opportunity for a complete input.  It is true statutorily that only twelve of us can vote, but that has scarcely been evident in the discussions 110 of 126within this Committee.  If some body has a good idea even if he or she does not have a vote, that idea may weigh more heavily in the final delibera tions than the comments of someone who is a voting member.  So I think we’ve got to do something along the lines I suggested. group that will move forward on this subject fr om where we are?  Perhaps when there is something to report Vincent could send out a note .  And the conclusion of that note may well be that we ought to have a phone conference.  Incidentally, we now ha ve a videoconferencing system.  It worked very well at the Dallas m eeting.  Why don’t we do videoconferencing FOMC calls?  Is there a reason at the moment why we wouldn’t? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I don’t know th e answer to that, Mr. Chairm an.  I suspect it’s related to the fact that the tape recordi ng equipment is in this room.  Bu t that is something that we can address. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I venture to say th at there’s a solution to that.  We are approaching the bewitching hour, and to make sure that Michelle does not  tell a falsehood about when our meeting ended, we’re going  to have to bring this session to  a close.  Regrettably, I have on my list five people who wanted to speak and were  not able to do so.  But if there is a next meeting on this, the five of you will get priority  even if you’ve forgotten what you wanted to say!  I’ll give the list to the Secretary.  With that, the meeting is adjourned.

END OF MEETING 111 of 126
