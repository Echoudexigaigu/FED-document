CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good morning, ev erybody.  The first item provisionally on the agenda was a discussion of th e minutes of our January 27-28 me eting.  But Michelle Smith is in the process of trying to shoot down a very peculiar headline in the New York Times, and she is writing something on that.  So I’d like to postpon e this agenda item until later in the meeting because I don’t feel we ought to  discuss it without her being in attendance.  So first let me recognize the fact that, as all of you are aware and sa ddened by, Bob Parry is attending his last FOMC meeting—which means we gi ve him two votes!  [Laughter]

MR. PARRY.  It’s two mo re than I know about! 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  However, there is a restriction:  One has to offset the other.  We’ll be feting you at lunch, h opefully, and obviously we wish you the best.

MR. PARRY.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let’s turn to Dino Kos. MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be re ferring to the charts that Carol Low just circulated.  During the intermee ting period, markets fluctuated in response to somewhat tempered forecasts for economic  growth.  While some market segments appeared to be in a risk-reduction mode, othe rs were in a risk-seeking mode.  And in the foreign exchange market, the dollar appr eciated after a long pe riod of weakness.  Most of the focus was on the dollar–yen ra te amid continued very high levels of intervention by the Japanese authorities.  I’ll discuss each of these issues in turn.  Forward interest rates in the United States continued to grind lower as expectations for a pickup in  the labor market were dashed yet again.  The top panel graphs the three-month deposit rate and th e three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward going back to Novemb er 1, 2003.  The green tripwires are dates of employment reports, and the number ne xt to each tripwire is the difference between the expected payroll number and th e actual number reported that day.  In the But in the December 5 report, job growth undershot the consensus expectation by 93,000, and that was the first of four consecu tive disappointing re ports.  I should note that for this graph we used the number in the initial release—rather than any                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). 3 of 107subsequent revisions—since the first report is  the number the mark et responded to.  In any case, the focus on the employment data has been intense.  Although a lagging indicator, market participants are looking to the labor report to confirm other data that have already turned and thereby confirm th at the recovery has durability.  Treasury yields have been edging lo wer since January and declin ed sharply on March 5 after the latest employment report.  This morning the ten-year note was yielding about 3¾ percent.  Besides reacting to the empl oyment report and other data, the Treasury bank buying.  The Bluebook has a boxed sect ion on page 2 examining this issue.  The middle panel on the first page of my  handout graphs the ten-year note yield on the left scale and the aggregate amount of Treasury securities held in custody by the New York Fed on the right scale for th e period starting in January 2003.  From grew from $700 billion to about $800 bill ion. The ten-year yield traversed a wide range from about 3.10 percent during late spring to a high of about 4.60 percent and by November 2004 yielded 4¼ percent.  Since November Treasury holdings have gone up another $100 billion or so, and yields  on the ten-year note have declined about 50 basis points.  But the direct quant itative links between the two variables are hard to find.  In part the reason may be th at we cannot gauge the direct impact of the purchases because, as with sterilized foreign exchange intervention, we don’t know the counterfactual.  But certain other factors cannot be ignored when assigning relative weights for why yields are at their current levels.  First, as noted earlier, the data have been disappointing.  Second, earlier comments by Committee members that short-term rates would stay low have affected  the shape of the curve.  And third, there is the possibility that so me convexity-related purchases among MBS investors have also kicked in, though anecdotal reports suggest that these hedging programs have had only a limited impact so far.  Although the yield curve has flat tened a bit in the past few weeks, it is still very steep by historical standards. The bottom pa nel graphs the spreads of the ten-year note less the three-month bill since 1990.  Some  investors believe that yields should be much higher at the long end of the cu rve, but they are ba ttling a countervailing force that should not be underestimated—na mely, the very attr active yield pickup between the financing rate and the return on longer-term securities. That dynamic has the capacity to keep bringing new investors into the trade for as long as investors believe financing rates will stay low.  Turning to page 2, breakeven rates on TI PS were rising—especially for the five-year maturity—until very recently when nominal rates moved lower and reduced the breakeven point.  One interesting character istic of recent price action has been the convergence of the five- and ten-year breakev en rates.  What is unclear is whether this reflects a change in the inflation outl ook for the second five years in that time span or whether it reflects technical reasons related to recent increases in the CPI that have had a greater impact on the value of the five-year maturity.  4 of 107The middle left panel graphs the investme nt-grade spread, while the middle right panel graphs the high-yield and EMBI+ sp reads and the Brazilian component of the EMBI.  All of those spreads widened after the last FOMC meeti ng and the change in wording in the Committee’s post-meeting statem ent.  In Brazil, local events affected spreads as well as the fact that Brazilian  paper is often used as a proxy hedge for other less liquid securities.  These spread s may suggest the beginnings of a risk-reduction phase in markets.  To some exte nt this widening was long awaited given the concerns that had been expressed for mont hs about the underpricing of risk in these segments.  Other price movements sugges ting the onset of a risk-reducing phase include the decline of equity prices.  A lthough all of the equity  indexes started the year strong, the weakness in the past few weeks has now put all of the major U.S. indexes into negative territory for the year to date.   The pattern in European markets has larg ely paralleled events in the United States, though not always for the same r easons.  As shown in the bottom panel, expected short-term interest rates have been falling in Eu rope as well.  In part the economic data did not come out as strong as the markets had hoped.  But perhaps the more important factor—until very recently—has been the strength of the euro.  With the euro’s appreciation in December and Janua ry, the markets came to believe that the ECB would ease policy to counteract the curren cy’s strength.  However, with the very recent depreciation of the euro from $1.29 to about $1.2350, some of the pressure was taken off, and the ECB kept rates steady at its last meeting. Nevertheless, the markets still seem to place fairly high odds that the next move could be an easing one.  The exchange value of the dollar has pr eoccupied both foreign and domestic asset then rebounded sharply, as shown in the top panel on page 3.  The reasons for the rebound seem to lie as much in the real m of technical analysis and position adjustments as in any interpretation of th e fundamentals.  Data on positions are hard to come by.  But one source that gives us  a glimpse is the commitment of traders report published by the IMM every week for currency futures market activity.  Although admittedly imperfect, it does offer one window into the activity of noncommercial users of futures. The bottom pa nel graphs for the euro and the yen the number of contracts held at  the end of each week since September 2003.  The recent shift from more than 50,000 long yen cont racts to about 10,000 short yen contracts represents the largest weekly shift in the hist ory of this time series.  During that week, there was nothing in the data th at could explain such a shift.   It may simply have been a case of the dollar having fallen too far too fast and a consolidation needing to take place.  A variation on this has a link to the risk-reduction story:  That is, if risk positions were being reduced, this would incl ude the closing out of some of the large short dollar positions that had been built up.  In any case, the longer-term forecast among Street economists is for the dollar to re sume its decline, so  the dollar’s recent rebound has not changed the underlying sentiment.   In part that reflects concerns about the current account, and in part, as shown in the two middle panels, it reflects interest rate differentials—except with the yen—that favor other currencies.   5 of 107The yen story, as usual, is a bit more complicated.  For once the recent data for Japan have been decidedly more bullish.  Fourth-quarter GDP growth, for example, was reported to be at a 7 pe rcent rate.  Adding in the Ja panese current account surplus and the inflows into Japanese equities from foreign investors, it’s not surprising to see the yen facing upward pressures.  The panel at the top of page 4 shows (in the red line) the depreciation of the dollar–yen ex change rate through mid-March.  The blue bars graph the daily interventions by the Ja panese monetary authorities.  As the dollar moved down, Japan intervened steadily and sometimes in massive size to smooth the fall of the dollar.  Market participants noted  a change once the dolla r began to rise.  It appeared that the Ministry of Finance (M OF) was actively seeking to push the dollar higher—in contrast to its pr evious action of smoothing out the decline as the dollar was falling.  The largest and most controve rsial intervention occu rred on March 5, the day of the employment report.  The middle panel graphs for that day the intraday evolution of exchange rates indexed from midnight eastern time for the yen, the euro, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, and the pound sterling.  At 8:30 a.m., the weaker-than-expected employ ment report was released.  Yields and the dollar both fell sharply.  The exception was the dollar–ye n exchange rate, which disengaged from other currency rates and act ually rose.  The MOF bought $11 billion dollars in the hours after the data release and, in effect , pushed the rate in the opposite direction than that suggested by that new piece of fundamental information.  Market participants were confused by the price action, which thre w some of the cross rates out of alignment and adversely affected liqui dity.  We’ve heard anecdotal reports that speculators have reduced their activity in the dollar–yen currency pair—reports corroborated by data from the major interd ealer brokers indicati ng that activity in dollar–yen has been flat or going down in recent quarters.  The dollar–yen rate fell again late yesterday and this morning follo wing Japanese newswire reports that the Japanese authorities would cease large-scale intervention after the end of the fiscal year.  This morning the dollar was down about 1 yen, at 109.35.  During the intermeeting period Japan bought—incl uding overnight purchases—$76 billion, bringing to $138 billion its purchases in the fi rst two and a half months of the year.  For comparison’s sake, during a very busy 2003, Japan bought $180 billion over the entire twelve-month span.  Leaving aside the trials and tribulations of the exchange markets, other Japanese asset markets appear unfazed by the scale of the intervention.  As seen at the bottom left, equity prices in Japan rose, in cont rast to the pullbacks in U.S. and European equity markets.  Bank stocks have continued to rally as they have since the bailout of Resona in May.  The recent IPO of Shinsei was in demand, and with GDP forecasts generally being raised, the bad debt situation is expected to improve somewhat.  Though at one point there was a sharp sello ff in the Japanese government bond (JGB) numbers.  Although there has been chatter about the Bank of Japan’s having to plan for an exit strategy from its very accommodative stance, most JGB investors still seem to think that is a long way off.  6 of 107There were no foreign operations in this period, Mr. Chairman.  I will need a vote to approve the domestic operations.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I noted in th e chart on the Fed custody holdings of Treasury securities, shown in the middle panel on page 1, that there are a couple of periods of very significant rise.  If one tries to compare th em with the Japanese intervention data on page 4, it obviously doesn’t square in the slightest.  Indeed, it looks as though the in tervention of very early 2004 didn’t show up in the custody holdings un til the third week in January.  Is that the typical time lag? MR. KOS.  Well, there are a lot of moving parts here.  The aggregate custody holdings are for all countries.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, I assume the Japanese are dominant. MR. KOS.  In terms of the delta, Japan is obvi ously a key contributor.   But there are a lot of major players and many ins and outs in these fi gures.  Also for Japan, their cash has actually been rising over the last few months.  That is published on their web site.  I believe almost a quarter of their reserves, if I ha ve my numbers right, are now he ld in cash.  So they are not automatically–  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Cash meaning deposits?  MR. KOS.  Deposits, right.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Where?  In domestic  banks or foreign banks?  In dollars? MR. KOS.  In banks in dollars.  So it’s not that they are automatically buying dollars and immediately putting them into Treasuries.  There ha s been a lag, and in fact  that lag actually has been growing. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I thought the lag was just two or three days. 7 of 107MR. KOS.  Well, it is if they are immediately buying securities.   But again, if we look at their deposit data, we see that their cash has b een rising, so they are not immediately putting all of their intervention dollars to work. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do the securities go into custody at the point of purchase? MR. KOS.  At the point of settlement. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’m sorry, I meant at the point of settlement.  So it’s not an issue of their purchasing a secur ity, taking it home, and then sending it back, so to speak.  They purchase it, and at settlement  it goes into custody as a book entry item, and that’s it. MR. KOS.  Exactly.  Again, though, one of th e missing pieces is how much of their dollar purchases are staying as  deposits rather than going directly into securities. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  On the bottom char t of page 1, everybody uses that spread between the ten-year note and the three-month bill.  But what the comparison in that chart is supposed to capture is better captured by using a one-year maturity nine years out because clearly the ten-year note is picki ng up an average of everything fr om one day out to ten years.  I understand that it’s not a market rate .  It’s a work of art, based on fi rst differences in the chart.  Is there any reason that we don’t do that other comparis on instead?  That’s the rate we really want to see.   MR. KOS.  Yes, this is used because I think people tend to be more familiar with this relationship.  I was not trying to be precise, but I wanted to show that there is a sense in which the people who have been saying that yields ought to be a lot higher are really fighting this in part.  That is, the spread is so high that—  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The spread is actually 5 points, not 3. 8 of 107

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  The contours of  the chart would be the same  if one used the ten-year-ahead forward rate less, say, the one-year-ahead forward rate.  The amplitude would be higher, and the spread would wind up at something like 5 ⅛ percent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In the short term it would be, but not as the slope of the yield curve changes.  The spread is  affected by that slope.  The poi nt is that what you’re trying to measure here is being muddied by the fact th at the numbers are already partially in the numerator.  With respect to the chart at the bo ttom of page 3, those IMM commitment data can’t have anything to do with the dollar because the eu ro is unchanged.  It’s a technical issue with respect to the yen and has nothing to do with anything el se as far as I can see. MR. KOS.  Well, that’s a good point .  In the interest of full di sclosure, I must say that I put the euro in there just to point out that there wasn’t a un iversal response from this group.  Now, one of the anecdotal stories that we keep  hearing is that ther e’s a group of market participants—if not hedge funds then CTAs and model-driven accounts—that are becoming more and more important in the marketplace.  A lot of these funds use the same kinds of models, and when their moving average triggers get hit, they  all tend to move at the same time.  So what we seem to have had is that kind of move—in the yen in particular. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, it looks as though 100,000 contracts just got—is it yen delta hedging?  It’s curious. MR. KOS.  It was a dramatic move.  Again, it seemed to be very much a position-adjustment story, and that was the point I was tryi ng to convey.  It seemed to be a change driven not by fundamentals but by technical  factors—and those technical fa ctors were most powerful in the yen. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Other questi ons for Dino?  President Minehan. 9 of 107

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Dino, I was intrigued by your thoughts regarding the beginning of a risk -reduction phase.  How strongly do you feel about that?  I may be slightly behind the curve in te rms of the way market participan ts are looking at this; but from people in the investment business around Boston, I s eem to be getting more comments about the amount of risk that is out there. MR. KOS.  Yes, we’re really seeing some crossc urrents.  On the one hand, if we talk to people who are active in, say, Treasuries, we he ar a lot about the carry  trade and about an expansion of risk and leverage.  

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.   MR. KOS.  On the other hand, there are pocke ts where risk-reduction moves do seem to be occurring—where people have had some losses and then reduced their other positions.  It’s not universal.  This may be a very short-term pha se that was localized or limited to a couple of as if we have some conflicting forces going on here. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  I wondered if you had any more thoughts on the dollar, Dino.  The dollar’s rise is rather surprising given the disappoin ting data we’ve had on the U.S. economy and the pervasive expectations of further declines?  Or is this the end? MR. KOS.  Well, explaining exchange rates is  always a risky business.  The rebound in part seems to have been technically inspired. It’s  hard to pinpoint, but I think a number of things were going on that had some effects.  I didn’t spend much  time talking about economic 10 of 107developments in Europe, but there has not been as much of an improvement in Europe as people thought there would be three or f our months ago.  If Europe ha d performed better over the last few months, then we might not have had this re bound in the dollar.  On the other hand, as I pointed out, the underlying sentimen t among the strategists on the St reet really hasn’t changed.  When the euro got to 1.29, a number of people thought  that the market was ripe for a correction.  One fellow on our foreign exchange committee, wh ich is a private-sector group, said when the euro was at 1.28, “We’ll see 1.20 before we see 1 .30.”  So this may be a natural process that we’re going through of a flushing out of positions, and we may have a revival of the trend we were seeing.  But that’s one guess.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  As I understand it, Mr. Chairm an, someone has to move for approval of the Desk’s transactions, and I’l l volunteer for that duty.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s not a great burden, I hope!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  It’s a lot easier than talking about the exchange rates. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any objections?  Does anyone else want to speak before we close the questions?  If not, I will accept you r motion and assume, without objection, that the Desk’s transactions are approved.  David Stockton and Karen Johnson. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairma n.  As usual, we have received a mixed bag of data since the January FOMC  meeting.  Over most of the past six months, when we said “mixed” data, we generally meant data that were either stronger than we had expected or that were a lot stronger  than we had expected.  By contrast, during this intermeeting period, we received figures on both sides of our upward momentum to activity than we had previously thought.  Our largest disappointment was centered in the labor market.  Private nonfarm payrolls were flat in February and have been increasing at  a pace of only about  65,000 per month since the upturn in hiring began last September.   That is well below the pace we had envisioned several months ago.  To be  sure, initial claims for unemployment 11 of 107insurance since the turn of th e year have fluctuated in a range that in the past was associated with stronger employment gains than we have experienced to date.  But those data likely reflect a decline in layoffs, and we have scant evidence, as yet, that new hiring has picked up materially.  There have been a few hopeful signs in the recent data:  Temporary-help employment ha s been trending higher since last spring, and the average workweek has moved up since the turn of the year .  But those looked to us to be thin reeds on which to rest our earlier projection.  As a consequence, we projected growth of hours worked.  If the pattern of the past couple of years had been repeated, this would have been yet another occasion for a weak labor mark et report to result in a further upward revision to productivity.  But this time, so mewhat softer readings on manufacturing production and on spending persuaded us to revise down our projection of the growth of real GDP by about as much as we revised hours, leaving our productivity projection about unchanged.  Among the sligh tly softer indicators that influenced our thinking was manufacturing IP.  Despite an  increase of 0.8 percent in February, smaller gains in December and January t ook down our projected increase in factory output in the current quarter from 7 percent at  an annual rate to 6 percent.  Obviously, this is a revision best viewed as one of quantitative degree rather than one of qualitative substance.  The anecdotal repor ts still seem to signal steady improvement in the manufacturing sector.  We just don’t see quite the degree of  vigor that earlier indicators had suggested.  We also have had, on net, some negative surprises in the spending data.  Perhaps consistent with the slightly softer readings on IP, both exports and inventory investment have come in below our e xpectations.  The weakness in inventory investment is somewhat surprising to us  in light of the low carrying costs of inventories.  We have heard reports that  some firms have encountered difficulties acquiring needed materials and some discontent on the part of businesses with breakdowns in their just-in-ti me inventory arrangements.  These difficulties may have held down inventory investment.  But we  don’t believe this is a phenomenon with sufficient breadth or magnitude to explain the meager additions that firms have made to their inventories in recent months.  Instead, we think the subdued pace of stockbuilding likely reflects the same con tinued cautious behavi or on the part of businesses that is evident in their hiring decisions.  The single largest source of downward re vision to our GDP projection has been construction activity, where the recent data have come in below expectations for the residential, nonresidential, and state and local sectors.  To be sure, we had anticipated some falloff in residential construction from the torrid pace set late last year.  But the drop-off in starts in January, especially in the single-family sector, was larger than we had penciled in.  Moreover, sales of new and existing homes also fell significantly, and as a consequence, the commissions on those sales, which are part of GDP, amplified the slowdown of spending in th is sector.  Homebu ilding figures for 12 of 107family starts—from an upward-revised fi gure of 1.55 million units in January to 1.49 million units in February.  Nevertheless,  permits have remained quite firm, and they point to some bounceback in constructi on in coming months.  All told, these data might take a tenth off of our current- quarter GDP projecti on.  Nonresidential construction activity also has come in be low expectations.  Construction of office buildings, commercial structur es, and manufacturing facilities continues to contract.  Although there are faint signs of improveme nt, vacancy rates remain high and rents soft.  Meanwhile, although budget c onditions are improving among state governments, funds are still very tight, and these entities have further trimmed their construction spending.  The only other notable area of greater-tha n-expected softness has been spending on light motor vehicles.  Sales averaged  about 16¼ million units in January and inventories appear a bit high to us.  In th e projection, we resolve that tension through a combination of production restraint and a pick up in sales that is induced in part by a sweetening of incentives.  It is important to note that not all of  the news over the past seven weeks was negative.  Excluding motor vehicles, consum er spending was actually a bit stronger than we had expected.  And business outlays for equipment and software were noticeably stronger in both the fourth and first quarters than we had projected in capital equipment outside of high-tech and transportation has posted a marked acceleration in recent months.  As you know, equipment spending had appeared to us to have been unusually weak over the past year or so given our view of the key fundamentals—a low cost of capital, accelera ting final sales, and ample increases in cash flow.  That gap is now closing, a nd along with the continued boost from the partial-expensing provision, we are projec ting that real E&S will maintain double-digit gains through the end of the year.  Taken together, the incoming data led us to revise down the projected growth of real GDP by a little more than ½ percentage po int at an annual rate in the first half of this year, after a bit larger re vision in the fourth quarter of  last year.  All else being equal, multiplier effects would have argued fo r a lower growth rate in the second half of this year as well.  However, the subs tantial rally that ha s occurred in the bond rates, and those lower rates are expected  to provide a considerable cushion to spending going forward.  Still, we do have on net a lower level of real GDP, and hence a higher output gap, throughout the projection pe riod compared with our previous forecast.  Whereas in January, the output gap was nearly eliminated by late next year, in the present forecast that gap remains at nearly ¾ percent of potential GDP at the end of 2005.  13 of 107With more slack in resour ce utilization, you might have expected to see somewhat lower inflation in this projection.  That  effect, however, was offset by several countervailing considerations.  First, the incoming data on core inflation were a bit above our expectations in recent months .  Moreover, oil prices have moved up sharply and are expected to st ay higher for longer than in  our January forecast.  And finally, the prices of non-oil imports have in creased more rapidly of late than we had anticipated earlier. The bottom line is that we still expect core PCE prices to increase about 1 percent this year and next.  Stepping back from the details of the forecast, we continue to believe that the data and the anecdotes are consistent with an  economy that is expanding fast enough to take up slack in the economy’s utilization of resources.  We expect fiscal stimulus, accommodative monetary policy, and ongoing rapid gains in structural productivity to sustain a brisk expansion thr ough the end of next year.  Coming as it has on the heels of an extended period of mostly upside surpri ses, the events of the past seven weeks, including last week’s bombing in Spain, have  clearly restored a sense of two-way risk to the outlook.  Just how larg e are those risks?  Well, that ’s a question that we have been working to answer more precisely for you.  As you know, we included confidence intervals around some key variables in our forecast as a standard feature for the first time in this Greenbook.  Over the past few years, we have shifted somewhat the emphasis of our forecast presentation away from a single narrative focused on explaining the ba seline projection toward inclusion of more material highlighting some of the chief risks surrounding the economic outlook.  The presentation of confidence intervals fo r the projection seemed to us a logical extension of that effort.  We have calculate d those confidence intervals both using the real-time track record of the staff forecas t and using stochastic simulations of our large-scale econometric model.  We thought  several purposes could be served by including these measures in the Greenbook.    One very important purpose is to illust rate how much uncertainty surrounds the staff baseline projection.  For this purpos e, the confidence intervals calculated using the actual forecast record of the staff pr ojection would seem the most informative measures.  Those intervals are, indeed, wide.  The 70 percent confidence interval around our projection of a 5¼ percent unempl oyment rate in the fourth quarter of 2005 runs from 4¼ percent to 6 percent.  Si milarly, the 70 percent confidence interval around our forecast of a 1 percent increase in core PCE prices in 2005 runs from about zero to 2 percent.  And it is important to remember that  this implies that there is a 30 percent chance that the actual outcom e will lie outside these bounds.  The width of these bands does provide me with one sm all consolation.  When asked in the past how confident I have been about various aspects of our projection, I believe the record will show that I have almost consis tently responded “not ve ry.”  It looks as though I’ll be pretty safe sticki ng to that answer.  [Laughter]  We also included in the table and as fan charts confidence intervals generated by stochastic simulation of FRB/US.  The reason that we have added this second 14 of 107approach to the mix is that it allows us to undertake calcula tions that cannot be performed with the Greenbook forecast errors.  For example, we can decompose sources of forecast uncertainty in the wa y that we did recently in a pre-FOMC briefing for the Board, breaking out infla tion uncertainty into uncertainty about supply, demand, and the unexplaine d equation residual.  This  approach also provides us with an ability to compute certai n conditional probabilities—for example, probabilities of deflation under different mone tary policies.  We have provided some of this material to the Committee in the recent past, and we anticipate doing more of the same in the future.  We also will continue to pl ot in the fan charts the a lternative scenarios that we present in the Greenbook.  Like  the confidence intervals displayed in those charts, the alternative simulations are generated using our large-scale model.  A number of you have remarked on occasion that, after reading the descriptions of the alternative scenarios, you were surprised to see that all we got on GDP growth or the unemployment rate were a few lousy tenths a nd, in most scenarios, considerably less than that on the inflation rate.  I have noted in response that  a drawback to the alternative scenarios is that they do not account for all of th e covariation in the shocks to which the economy is subjected.  The conf idence intervals generated by stochastic simulations do just that.  By placing the alternative scenarios in the fan charts, we hope to provide you with a better perspect ive on just how much of the probability space we are exploring with  those alternatives.   Finally, the confidence intervals may provide a context for the Committee to consider the uncertainty surrounding the proj ections that you include  in the Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.  As you know, those forecasts are presented as ranges and central tendencies.  But, of course, ra nges and central tendenc ies are measures of forecast consensus, not measures of forecas t uncertainty.  Based on our past forecast errors, the 70 percent confidence interval surrounding our forecast of the unemployment rate in the four th quarter of this year is  about 1¼ percentage points wide; in contrast, the width of the FOMC’s  forecast range of the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year was just ¼ percentage point wide .  So, while there is considerable consensus on the Committee a bout the expected unemployment rate late this year, there is probably much greater uncertainty associated  with each of your individual forecasts.  Needless to say, advertising our ignorance in such an explicit fashion gave us some pause.  But given the increasing prev alence of product liability lawsuits, we thought some appropriate warning on the Greenbook forecast was warranted.  Perhaps the confidence intervals should be viewed as something like a warning label that reads, “Do not operate large economie s while under the influence of a baseline projection alone.”  Karen will now continue our presentation.   

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  The staff forecast for ec onomic activity abroad this year and next is one of moderately robust growth and contained inflation.  This favorable picture reflects the rebound in the global high-tech industry as previous 15 of 107overinvestment has been worked off; the positive spillovers to the rest of the world of the expansion of the U.S. economy; and the fruits of the accommodative policy, particularly monetary policy, that has been in place in many foreign economies for some time.   Expansion abroad is no longer just pros pective.  Although foreign growth during the second half of last year did not ma tch that in the Unite d States, it rebounded sharply from the troubled outcome during the fi rst half of the year , with total foreign real GDP growth averaging more than 4¼ per cent.  To be sure, there were substantial differences across countries, with those in  emerging Asia charging ahead and those in the euro area only inching forward.  Neverthe less, by the fourth quarter of last year the expansion was widespread and becoming more firmly established.  Indicators for the current quarter confirm that this proce ss has continued.  In some economies where growth was unsustainably strong, such as Ja pan and China, we are looking for some moderation going forward.  And we expect that  output in the euro  area will accelerate a bit further this quarter and next to come closer to the potentia l rate of growth for that region.  Of course, I would not be doing my duty to you if I did not look for the black cloud among all this sunshine.  Two issues seem to merit further discussion:  recent developments in oil and other primary comm odity prices and concerns about the ever-expanding need to finance the U.S. external deficit.    Despite persistent forecasts of declining oil prices, spot  prices for WTI have risen from about $30 per barrel to $37 over the pa st six months, including a $3 per barrel rise since your January meeting.  To some extent, the higher oil prices have been muted abroad as many foreign currencies have appreciated ag ainst the dollar.  Accordingly, the balance of demand and suppl y in the global oil market would tend to push up dollar oil prices at a time of general dollar depreciation.  Other factors supporting spot oil prices are the current low level of inventories, OPEC production policy, the risk of instability  in some oil-supplying countries, and the strength of demand as the global economy expands.  Neve rtheless, futures markets continue to expect declines in the price of oil going forward.  Were a ny of several possible supply disruptions to occur, the re sulting spike in oil prices could threaten the global recovery and put some upward pres sures on prices more broadly.    Nonfuel global primary commodity prices  also have risen sharply in recent months.  Utilizing spot and futures prices , we project that these commodity prices will increase at an annual rate of nearly  50 percent in the current quarter before ups in commodity prices have occurred prev iously.  This forecast applies broadly to all the categories of nonfuel primary commodities.  Thus th e outlook is that the very rapid rate of increase in these prices will prove transitory, in pa rt because of supply factors and the expected supply response to strong demand.   16 of 107Some have expressed concerns that the inflation in commodity prices is a leading indicator of rising inflation pressures more broadly throughout the global economy.  Within industrial countries, however, prim ary product prices are a very small input into the determination of prices for final products.  And a rela tive price change in favor of primary goods will only partially re trace a trend against their relative price that has been ongoing for some time.  Neve rtheless, particular bottlenecks for some products could arise if demand for prim ary products remains strong, supported by continued rapid output growth in China and elsewhere.    Debate about the risks to the global economy posed by the large and growing U.S. current account deficit has been rising in volume as global recovery proceeds.  Two data releases to the public since the Greenbook was distributed—the TIC data on provide some information on how that defici t has been financed in recent months.  The TIC data were discussed in Part 2 of the Greenbook as we had that data before Thursday.  As was the case in November and December, foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities were quite st rong, reversing the shar p reduction in those purchases seen in September and October.  Financial market concer ns that these data might be signaling a major shift in foreign pr eferences away from U.S. assets appear already to have abated.  When these data were released on Monday morning, there was little market reaction.  The balance of payments data contained new information on U.S. net investment income in the fourth quarter. That figure came in significantly more positive than we had been expecting and implied a current  account deficit in that quarter about $25 billion less than in the Greenbook.  This  positive revision is entirely explained by higher income receipts on U.S. direct investment abroad, which in part is due to the depreciation of the dollar and the resulting higher dollar value of recorded foreign profits.  In response to these data, we ha ve narrowed our projection for the current account deficit this year and next by about  $20 billion and $10 billion respectively.  These data only add to the mystery of how the world’s largest debt or country can earn significant net income on its foreign investment position.  The balance of payments data also re ported the complete picture of capital inflows and outflows for 2003 and gave us our first look at th e foreign direct investment figures for the fourth quarter .  For the year as a whole, the major components of foreign private capital flows to the United St ates, securities purchases and direct investment, remained very  large—around $450 billion—and were not much changed from the figure for 2002.  Yet much has been made of the increase in the foreign official holdings of dollars.  These net purchases doubled between the two years from around $100 billion to a bit over $200 billion. Two items in the balance of payments data reconcile these facts.  Firs t, U.S. investors switched from being net sellers of foreign securities to net purchasers and at the sa me time U.S. foreign direct investment abroad remained strong.  So U. S. capital outflows e xperienced a swing of about $100 billion to about $220 billion.  S econd, the current account deficit itself widened about $60 billion.  Thus capital infl ows faced a larger financing hurdle in 17 of 1072003 than in 2002.  Looking ahead, we see the current account deficit continuing to present a moving target, reaching $600 billion by the end of next year.  Capital outflows are particularly hard  to forecast, but our projec tion calls for them to rise slightly over the forecast period.  Our forecast for only a slight downward tilt in the foreign exchange value of the dollar implies that some combination of private capital inflows to the United States plus increases in foreign official holdings will willingly finance the expanding deficit plus the outflows that occur at exchange rates near thos e of today.  This may seem like a major challenge.  But I point out that the foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities in December and January, when expressed at an average annual rate, by themselves come to nearly $650 billion.  Dave and I would be happy to take your questions.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do you have any br eakout on foreign affiliate earnings in foreign currencies and the extent  to which earnings are converte d to dollars—resulting in much larger amounts of dollars at th e prevailing exchange rate?   

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I asked my staff if they c ould make that decom position, and I basically got “no” for an answer.  [Laughter]  The dilemm a is that we’re talking about looking at this across all the different currenc ies and all the different—  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Ther e’s a lot of hedging going on. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I understand.  And that is sh ifting a bit when this  valuation effect shows up and when there were offsetting gains on the one hand versus losses on the other.  Remember we’re talking now about U.S. earnings ab road, not foreign earnings here.  At any rate, the staff did not seem hopeful that they could disentangle the earnings in euro, yen, Canadian dollars, and pounds and the exchange rate effects as  reported in these data.  We know the general tendencies, but we don’t have enough data to do the actual accounting th at would disentangle that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I know you eventually  get it, but at this stage do you have the foreign affiliate earnings by major geographic areas?   18 of 107

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I raised that question.  I think what we’d have to do at this point is to look at annual reports or something.  At some later point we may have those data. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In other words,  Commerce publishes the data but with a significant lag? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I ask because th eoretically one could take the dollar earnings and literally convert them back to their foreign currencies. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Back to their foreign currencies. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Of course, you do n’t know what’s hedging and what isn’t hedging, but at least it gives you a rough idea.  The problem is that you need to wait for the earnings data. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  And we would have to do it ov er time in order to track foreign earnings versus the imputed exchange rate effects that we  would have injected in to that calculation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, a significant part of that is the oil earnings of U.S. companies.  I must tell you, though, that if you try to reconcile company reports with the Commerce numbers you will think you’re looking at  two separate universes.  The bookkeeping that goes on there makes Enron’s bookkeeping look like Accounting I.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I have a question about page 10 in Part 1 of the Greenbook, which has to do with the assumptions on labor productivity through 2005.  You have productivity growth dropping to only 1.6 percent from 3.0 percent in  2004 and 5.3 percent last year.  I asked Bob Rasche to look at the time series properties, and it looks as if la bor productivity growth is pretty close to a random walk.  Obviously it can’t be literally a random walk.  But you have a major drop in 2005, and perhaps you could explain where that comes from. 19 of 107

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  It’s a deceleration, not act ually a decline, in productivity.  That consider to be a fairly optimistic view on the gr owth of potential output, th e level of productivity is above its long-run trend.  This pattern looks to us like standard  cyclical behavi or.  What we have is a deceleration in productivity as it goes fr om above trend back toward trend.  That results in a slowdown in the growth of productivity an d accounts for the step-up in payroll employment that we believe will occur.  Again, that looks to us to be consistent  with the cyclical time series performance of productivity around a spline function type trend, wh ich is basically the way we put together the longer-run produc tivity forecast.  So as many of you have noted over the past year or so, that forecast incorpor ates a significant element of risk.  It certainly has been an area where we have been wrong and wrong rather consis tently in one directi on over this particular period—that is, in anticipating th at some of what we perceive to be cyclical increases in productivity are going to abate go ing forward.  As I think I responded to President Minehan at the last meeting, we really just don’t have a lot to go on in terms of  gauging how much of a backlog of one-time efficiency improvements sti ll exists out there.  So in writing down these figures in our forecast, we are tr ying to blend some judgment and so me econometrics.  But this is indeed an area where our confid ence is not terribly high. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  An implication would be a major swing in unit labor costs next year compared with this year, and presumably that mi ght affect the inflation outlook.  At any rate, I think this is a fairly import ant part of the outlook for 2005.  Growth in productivity of 1.6 percent, of course, is e quivalent to the miserable 1974- 95 average.  I understand the argument for it. 20 of 107

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  That would be an averag e over a long period of  time whereas this would be a relatively brief period of somewhat lo wer cyclical growth.  On  the inflation point, I would just note that we don’t thi nk there is a big effect on prices from swings in unit labor costs that are associated with cyclic al movements in productivity.  We tend to believe that firms in their pricing behavior try to look through cyclical  movements.  So the implicit acceleration in unit labor costs that is incorporated in this projection does not exert much upward pressure on inflation. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  But, of course, it also  feeds into the employment outlook. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Right, employ ment and profits both.  I think in some sense in the forecast we have a cyclical slowing in profits that al so looks to us to be fa irly typical.  What we typically see is a big increase in profits when productivity is soaring in the early stages of a business cycle and then, as produc tivity slows down, profits grow th slows as well and the labor share begins to recover.  Admittedly this cycle has been one where everything has been more drawn out, so to speak, than has been the case in th e past.  And because of that we feel much less confidence in gauging the timing of that  cyclical slowing in productivity. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Except for the second half of  last year, we haven’t had the typical recovery surge.  So in one sense we may not be ve ry far into the expansion phase of the cycle.   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  That’s a very real possibility. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  This is obviously part of the ’05 projection, but I was very interested in where that came from.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Dave, there is a simulation calle d “rising inflation e xpectations” in the Greenbook in which inflation expectations increa se gradually by 1 per centage point.  I don’t 21 of 107know from what level to what leve l, but I do know that some of the surveys that we see, such as the Blue Chip survey, suggest that infla tion expectations are quite high—around 2¼ or 2½ percent.  I think it would be interesting to know what the re sults of a declining inflation expectations scenario would be because, if indeed the market expects 2 percent, it’s possible that view could change.  If that were to occur, I would assume that conceivably we could see inflation rates moving down from current levels.  So I’d find th at to be a more interesting alternative.  But I just don’t know what the levels were in th e scenario where the inflation expectations number rose 1 percent.   It went up from what to what? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Actually, I’d have to go back  and ask our model folks because it’s in terms of the implicit inflation expectati on that is embedded in that model.  

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  I bet it’s a lot lower than 2½. MR. STOCKTON.  I’m sure it’s lower than 2½ percent.  MR. PARRY.  You could exogenou sly make it 2½ percent.  

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  We highlighted this scenario in part because the model probably incorporates lower inflation expect ations than those of some market  participants.  And in light of the decline in the dollar and the acceleration of co mmodity prices, there are at least a few straws in the wind that suggest that perh aps inflation will not be as sangui ne as we are forecasting.  So we wanted to highlight that possibility to some  extent.  But I think you’re absolutely right: Around our baseline forecast we see that risk balanced against a risk that inflation expectations could come down further and maybe even considerably  further.  If our infl ation forecast begins to materialize in the data—surprising people in terms of how benign the be havior of prices will be—inflation expectations could decline.  A nd if the increase in commodity prices and the 22 of 107break to the downside as well. As we noted in the Greenbook, another downside ri sk that we see on the inflation side is that the markup over unit labor co sts looks very high to us and that’s associated with strong profitability as well.  We have that only tipping down over the forecast period, in part owing to the assumed deceleration in productivity.  It’s certainly possible, though, that we could get a sharper decline as competitive pressures put mo re downward pressure on the price markup.  That would be another source of significantly lower inflation going forward.  So while we view the risks as reasonably balanced, we certainly think we could have declining inflation expectations as well as increasing expectations. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Okay, thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wa nted to ask a quest ion about the labor the press.  Some of us were talking about this earlier, noting that a signifi cant part of the decline is due to a reduction in the teenag e labor force participation rate.  There has been a big increase in school enrollment rates for teenagers as we ll.  I was wondering if you had any thoughts on these developments and their implications for the tightness or weakness of labor markets and also for inflationary pressures. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  We have interpreted this downturn in labor force participation as principally a cyclical phenomenon.  Nevertheless, we have revised down the level that we think the labor force participation will eventually return to; we’ve revised that down in light of the employment data.  But the basic message of our forecast is that a lot of the people who have 23 of 107withdrawn from the labor market will make th emselves available again when the economy and job prospects begin to improve.   Admittedly, we can’t see that from the discour agement data because, as you point out, the reasons people give for leaving th e labor force include leaving for sc hool or to take care of home responsibilities.  And an increasi ng number of people are reporting that they are retired.  So it’s possible that the reduced labor force participation will prove to be more persistent than we are anticipating.  If that’s the case, then in essence there is less slack in our baseline forecast.  If we get our growth forecast along with less of a bounceback  in labor force participation, there will be a bigger decline in the unemployment rate th an we’re showing, and the labor markets could tighten more immediately.  The result would be gr eater pressure on inflation than we’re showing.   I was going to say that I feel reasonably confident, but I gu ess I should strike that word from my lexicon, so I will say that we feel comfor table in our belief that a significant part of this downturn in participation will prove to have been cyclical.  That’s in part because of the timing of the downturn.  The peak in par ticipation coincided so closely w ith the peak in the tightness of the labor markets and the deterioration coincided so  closely with the period of persistently weak labor markets that it’s hard to th ink that it was not cyclical.  It would be difficult to consider it a coincidence that the trend turned significantly do wnward starting right at the peak of the business cycle.  But obviously that remains a risk.  We s ee the risks in this aspect of the projection more as one in which labor markets could tighten  more quickly than we’re forecasting. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  So the increase in school enrollment is something that we’ll see washing out as the labor market tightens? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Yes.  Part of the complication that has arisen in doing this analysis is that the questions in the household survey on labo r force participation were changed in the mid-24 of 1071990s, as you know.  Consequently, we have no cyclical experience in  terms of how people actually were responding to these questions about being in the labor force and why they were in or out of the labor force.  So we’re uncomforta ble with our ability to look at past cyclical patterns and draw a lot of inferences from that going forward. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Bill Wascher and his group, as you may know, are trying to simulate the old breakdown.  If they succeed, we’ll probably learn a few things about this issue. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Yes, Bill has been worki ng on the issue.  But ultimately, though we were changed—that we’re getting something that track s very closely with past  cyclical behavior.  But he is attempting to do that decomposition. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions for our colleagues?  If not, who would like to start the Committee discussion?  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Seventh District economy continues to improve.  In general our contacts are still upbeat, but even as th ey tell us the good news about current conditions, scattered si gns of nervousness about the future are creeping into the conversations, and we’re not completely sure why they’ve become more nervous.  Household spending generally remains robust.  Many retailers tell us that sale s are strong for a wide variety of merchandise.  This strength has led some merc hants to increase inventories and to cut back on discounts.  In contrast, automake rs are disappointed with sales so far this year, though they remain confident that sales will pick up late r in the year, partly in response to higher incentives—which they expect to have to offer. 25 of 107It is notable that this st rength in household spending is occurring despite weak job growth.  Many of our business contacts remain he sitant to hire even though they expect demand for their products to continue to improve.  To th is point they seem to think that they can meet improved demand through some combination of fu rther process improvements, stretching their current workforce, using temps, and just-in- time hiring.  Some still are concerned that the expansion will stall.  They do not, however, give us  very specific answers when we ask them to identify the downside risks and explain w hy they are weighing them so heavily.  On the other hand, the new CEO of Caterpil lar reported that, because of strong demand for their products, they plan to hire 1,000 net addi tional employees in the United States this year.  This is one of the few large firms that we are aw are of in our District th at has specific plans to hire a significant number of additional workers.  Also, one positive category in the payroll survey was temporary workers.  The large temporary-help firms we speak with are happy to have growth in billable hours, but the gains fall short of what they would have expected, given the strength in the overall economy.  And I’m su re we’ve all seen the Manpower survey of permanent hiring intentions for the second quarter , which just came out early this morning; it showed for the headline numbers the str ongest reading since be fore the recession. Business investment continues to improve, albe it modestly.  Much of  the capital spending we’re hearing about is geared to productivity enhancement, system integration, and automation expansion activities, which of course need not di rectly lead to new hiri ng.  Also, we’ve been hearing recently about a differe nt kind of capital overhang, whic h has to do with financial capital.  This relates to the discussion that Cathy and Dino had earlier to day regarding risk and liquidity.  We continue to hear about investment firms that are awash with liquidity and straining 26 of 107to place it.  This money is chasing deals and reportedly bi dding up prices of higher-risk investments. Something else our contacts are talking about  is the impact of the international economy on their business.  Several manufacturers indicate  that foreign demand and a weaker dollar have boosted orders and shipments.  Demand from ov erseas, particularly China, has pushed import prices up sharply for products such as energy, pape r fiber, and most metals  including, of course, steel.  It also has shown through in much higher shipping costs.  Some firms have had success in passing these cost increases on to their customers. On the labor front, a number of contacts sa id that the rhetoric surrounding the “off-shoring” of American jobs is ove rblown.  For example, one temporary-help contact said that his orders for domestic call center j obs continue to increase despite reports of these types of jobs moving overseas.  He added that the call center jobs being created  here are more sophisticated and require more-nuanced language skills than the routine types of jobs that are leaving.  Indeed, he reported that some companies that tried movi ng their more sophisticated calling operations abroad are now moving them back to the United States. Turning to the national outlook, the most  recent jobs data are obviously a big disappointment.  Layoffs are down, but firms are still very reluctant to hire new workers.  I wish we understood this better.  Is it nervousness about the outlook, as a few of my contacts mentioned, or is it something else?  In any case,  the weak job market has not depressed spending by consumers, and the fundamentals still suggest that  we’ll see decent job gains.  As usual, it’s just around the corner.  Unfortunately, we’re not sure which corner!  [Laughter]  So our outlook hasn’t changed much.  We still expect output growth to remain  above potential, eliminating resource slack sometime next ye ar.  Obviously, we’ll eventually need to adjust rates up fairly 27 of 107substantially.  But given the soft ness in the labor market and the low level of inflation, we don’t need to be in a hurry to start that adjustment. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Recent data and reports from our board of directors and others confirm that the economy in the Eleventh District is growing but somewhat more slowly than the national economy.  Home prices have softened  a little in all of our major metropolitan areas.  Apartment rents have fallen, and landlords are offering a mont h or two of free rent as an incentive.  One member of our Small Business Advisory Council mentioned last Thursday that, if landlord concessions keep growing at their cu rrent rate, tenants will be able to get one year’s free rent for signing a one-year lease.  [Laughter]  The office market, particularly in Dallas and to a lesser extent in Austin, is equally overbuilt.  Dallas has a six- to ten-year excess supply of office space, and new projects are still being announced.  Moreover, new money is flowing in to buy existing properties. The reason given is low interest rates.  The reason is not just the low financing costs, though, but the fact that few other good investment al ternatives are av ailable.  When rates rise, as they inevitably will, a wave of foreclosures and bankruptcies will likely follow.   The agricultural members of our advisory council mentioned that one factor that has sustained their industry through soar ing energy and fertilizer costs is  low rates of interest, thanks to the Fed.  Here, again, when ra tes begin to rise, a lot of marginal producers are going to have some problems.  The high-tech s ector, particularly around Austin, se ems to be in the early stages of improving.  Venture capital is beginning to  flow, and IPOs have resumed.  Unlike the situation a few years ago, any company wanting to expand can cheaply acquire office space, workers, and equipment.  Another turnaround aff ecting the Eleventh Dist rict is the Mexican economy, which is looking better than it has for a while.  Mexico’s i ndustrial production has 28 of 107risen in response to improvements in the U.S.  economy, and employment and hours worked in the maquila industry ended the year on a high no te.  After declining for three years, Texas exports to Mexico climbed in the second half of 2003. For the past year or so, I’ve been reporting a virtual absence of pricing pressures in our District.  I regret to say that this is beginning to change, thou gh I should add that it may be too early to conclude that the ove rall inflation situation has reve rsed.  Our January Beige Book reported skyrocketing prices for primary and fabri cated materials as well as shortages of steel and scrap.  There were downw ard price pressures as we ll, including for apparel, telecommunications, and autos.  Retail prices were declining, but at a slower rate than previously.  The February Beige Book reported a continuation of all the upward price pressures seen in January and more.  There were further pressures on energy and metals prices, but some manufacturers were reporting upward price pressures as well—and with great enthusiasm.  Several noted that for the first time in years they  have been able to ra ise prices and increase profits; hence the excitement.  One of our contacts noted that in th e last two months a basic shift had taken place in the construction industry from a buyer’s market to a seller’s market—a shift that, in his words “is unprecedented in its scope a nd staggering in its impact.”  At both our board meeting and our Small Business Advisory Council meeting, a good deal of discussion was devoted to the spreading effects of higher st eel and other building materials prices on the industry.  We are hearing the term “double or dering” for the first time in many years. As I look at the national economy, it looks as if  the expansion continues to gain traction, but I remain concerned that the employment situation has been so resistant to improvement.  At least the gains in productivity are restraining inflation; and weak job growth has restrained wage growth, which makes me less worried about inci pient inflationary pres sures stemming from 29 of 107sharply rising commodity prices.  Nonetheless,  I think we’ve crossed a tipping point in the economy, where the prospects for increasing inflation far exceed the prospects for declining inflation.  I don’t think the situati on calls for a shift in our policy stance just yet, but the situation does bear careful watching.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.   

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  New England mirrors the nation in that it seems to be experiencing both rising growth and a continued soft labor market.  Positive reports from businesses large and small, rising sale s and profits, gradually improving state budget pictures, and business and consumer optimism a ll are at odds with the employment situation.  Massachusetts seems particularly hard hit on th e employment side.  Re flecting this, there are increasing calls for legislation to prevent outso urcing—or offshoring or whatever one wants to call it—or at a minimum to prevent the state government from  dealing with companies who locate jobs in other countries.  One hopes calmer heads will prevail on this. On the labor market side, recently released employment benchmark revisions suggest that employment losses in 2003 were greater than previously thought, especially in Massachusetts.  However, the new data also suggest that most re cently the pace of job loss may have moderated a bit; while still declining, it may be falling by a lesser amount.  Massachusetts has had the sharpest percentage drop in employment of any state during the recovery , and employment levels now are more than 6 percent below their pre-rece ssion peak.  The other New England states have fared less poorly, and some have done even better than the nation as a whole; but only one state, Rhode Island, has recouped to the point where empl oyment is at its level prior to the recession.  At the same time, businesses report that some sk ills are extremely hard to find, including at the 30 of 107low end for hospitality jobs and at the high end for certain types of software support and for positions in health care and biotech. New England’s rate of inflation, as measured  by the Boston CPI, is rising much faster than the nation’s, largely because of a 6.3 percen t increase in shelter costs versus a year ago.  The high price of housing worries many in the re gion who find that hiring the skilled workers they need in health care, for example, is made even more difficult by high housing costs. Moving away from the employment picture, the District’s situation seems a lot brighter.  Beige Book contacts were considerably more upb eat about current sales and profit margins.  Manufacturers say the recovery has taken hold, while retailers expect steady growth over the next six to twelve months.  The Bank’s Small Business Advisory Council members also were generally upbeat at their recent meeting.  Acro ss a wide group of indus tries—from metal casting and stamping to home products, hospitality, and software development—most firms reported increasing revenues in 2004, rising net income, a nd plans both to increase capital spending and even to hire new staff.  Many of these firm s commented on the intense competition in their industries and on thei r current or planned investments in Mexico or China to improve their cost pictures and to meet foreign demand, particularly in the Chinese economy. High-tech firms are reporting so lid levels of growth, especi ally in security software, storage, and hardware.  Boston area software job postings are up 16 percent from a year ago as compared with a reported 8 percent increase in the Silicon Valley.  And the software industry group sees labor market tighten ing, particularly for certain jobs.  These businesses all commented on rising insurance costs, and some poin ted to the rising cost of nickel, cobalt, and steel scrap as limiting their pote ntial profit growth but not caus ing prices of final goods to escalate.  Apparently concerns abou t a lack of pricing power remain. 31 of 107Our Bank’s directors also noted  an improving situation, thou gh one that remains uneven.  On the weak side are businesses that serve commercial real estate, which report declining sales and jobs.  On the positive side, manufacturers of trucks and semiconductors are quite optimistic.  In the latter case, businesses both locally and nationally are expanding solidly, with book-to-build ratios growing and some shortages building.   Manufactured exports in the region were up sharply for the last quarter of 2003.  Busine ss confidence has brightened, and even the commercial real estate markets have shown a littl e stabilization or improvement.  In short, New England is growing, and all would be well if  only the job picture were a bit brighter. On the national scene, the puzzle about the slow  rate of growth in employment continues. Incoming data on business spendi ng are positive for the most part.  Corporate earnings are strong, credit quality has improved, and busin esses have increased borrowing in early 2004, presumably to add to inventories.  So, why aren ’t firms hiring?  We’ve said all along that the recovery would be sustainable when businesses began to spend again, under the assumption that hiring would resume as well.  The business sp ending part has happened.  The big question is whether the consumer might falter before the seco nd part, increased hiring, begins in earnest.   Our projections, like those of the Greenbook, suggest that the answer to when labor of the Greenbook forecast, with GDP growth in the 4½ to 5 percent ra nge in the first half of this year, assisted by continued fiscal and monetary  policy accommodation.  The impetus of fiscal stimulus eases in the second half  of this year and in 2005, but pr ivate-sector demand takes over.  We’re a little less optimistic about the second half of this year than the Greenbook, but by 2005 our forecasts converge nicely, with GDP growth ar ound 3 to 4 percent, the unemployment rate in 32 of 107the low 5s, and inflation stable or slightly rising.  It’s not a bad picture.  However, I wish I had some way of pinning down that “sometime soon” forecast for employment growth.   One hears anecdotes from all sides about the unwillingness of businesses to hire additional workers until doing so is absolutely ne cessary.  In that regard, I read with some interest the article—I think it was in Monday’s Wall Street Journal —about the surveys that ask about hiring intentions.  Apparently responses to  such surveys may be based more than usual on good intentions rather than firm plans.  I don’t know whether those surveys are really good predictors of future employment growth, but I w ould say that they are a source of some of the optimism about employment growth occurring soon.  In our pre-FOMC briefing at the Bank, one of the economists noted that something has to give. That is, the current situa tion of high productivit y, strong demand, and zero job growth just doesn’t seem sustainable.  On the downside, if productivity growth cont inues to increase as it has, employment could languish further—even if  demand is relatively good—and inflation could trend downward as well.  This could happen, too,  if consumers become disheartened by the job scene and stop buying houses and cars regardless of the low interest rates.  Demand would falter despite solid productivity growt h, and the output gap would widen. On the upside, business uncertainty could well dissipate faster than we expect.  Employment growth could come faster or be stronger than either our forecast or the Greenbook expects, pushing productivity down in the shor t run and pushing wages up, particularly for workers with hard-to-find skills.  Prices of oil, certain metals, steel scrap, and other commodities have risen.  The dollar seems bound to depreciate a bit further.  And health insurance costs continue to accelerate.  As one contact put it, the cost of all the “n ice to have” things continues to drop while the cost of things people really need— lik e houses, health care , and education—keeps 33 of 107rising.  I recognize that this is not how our measures of price trends capture what is happening, but it may say something about both the popularity of Treasury inflation-protected securities and the resiliency of inflationary expectations. I also remain concerned that the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy and the assurance that markets seem to have that  we are on hold has incr eased leverage across all burst of financial instability.  C ontacts tell me, as I noted before , that market participants are reaching out the risk curve for returns in this low interest rate environment.  It’s understandable that the risks that are being taken make these co ntacts increasingly nervous.  In an environment of excess capacity, these concerns don’t suggest to me that we should change policy in short order.  But as I balance the risks of slower-tha n-expected growth against the risks of faster growth, rising costs, and financial instability, I am more concerned about the upside.  My view is that maintaining a policy with in terest rates too low for too long is in the end a bigger concern than the possibility of a widening output gap.  To be sure, we have  the tools to deal with either case.  But I think the costs to us in terms of cred ibility would be greater if  the situation got out of hand on the upside.  Thus, assuming that the econo my continues on track as projected, I think we need to begin to reflect in our statements a willingness to move the funds rate up.  Then at some point after that, I hope we can begin a gradua l move to more neutral territory.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus. MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I th ink our District’s economic picture is not unlike Cathy’s.  There is certainly some good news in the latest information we have received, both in the data and th e anecdotal reports.  Activity c ontinues to expand at a fairly good pace as best we can tell, at least for now.  Manuf acturing, in particular, is in much better health 34 of 107now than it was a year ago—or even six months a go, I think it’s fair to say.  We do a monthly survey, and its latest readings indicate that fact ory shipments and new orders were very robust in both January and February.  Consumer spending ha s also been reasonably strong in this period, according to both the monthly survey we conduct and anecdotal information.  At our board meeting last w eek, all three of our class A banking directors indicated robust growth in both business and household cr edit loan demand.  And one of our directors, who is the CEO of a broadcasting company that has TV and radio affiliates not just in our District but in a number of majo r market areas around the country, indicated that recently there has been a sharp upswing in ad revenue in her business.  So we currently see some positive indicators in our regional economy in general.   Moreover, there is at least one  positive development in District labor markets, which is that factory employment is now stabilizing after dec lining for many, many months.  I made that point at our last meeting, and as  far as we can tell it’s still ba sically the case.  Obviously, though, after so many months of decline,  manufacturing employment is st abilizing at a very low level, and it is stabilizing only; we don’t have any evidence at this poin t that it’s really moving up.  More broadly, I don’t have a sense of any signifi cant firming in the job market overall in our region, and I think that is begi nning to have a negative impact on confidence.  I don’t want to overstate that, but I hear indicati ons of this impact in some of the comments I am getting from our business contacts. Turning now to the national economy, the soft February jobs report got  my attention, as it did everyone else’s.  In all my y ears in this business, I’m not sure  I’ve ever seen a monthly report receive more attention than that one.  And it pr ovided what may well be a healthy reminder that this expansion does not yet have full momentum; in  fact, I think there’s some possibility that the 35 of 107momentum is diminishing.  The Greenbook has revi sed down fairly consider ably its projections for real GDP growth for the first half of this year and to a lesser degree for the year as a whole.  I think that was an appropriate revision, given wh at we know now, and as a result the projected output gap has increased appreciably.  The wide r gap presumably would put downward pressure on core inflation, other things bei ng equal, but the Greenbook expects this effect to be offset in part by some spillage from higher energy prices in to the core inflation rate.  Of course, the weaker dollar also probably played into  your overall inflation forecast, David. I think the wider projected output gap is impor tant, but I’ve always thought that a really important determinant of inflation and disinflation trends in the short and intermediate term is unit labor costs.  So, when I try to assess the infl ation risk, I tend to focu s at least conceptually on some measure of the gap betw een actual and potential employmen t and on whether that gap is narrowing, staying constant, or widening.  The last several job reports imply that the employment gap has been widening, given that job growth as meas ured by the payroll survey has fallen well short of most estimates of the gr owth of the working-age population.  The Greenbook doesn’t report its estimate of potential employment and the em ployment gap, so I don’t know exactly what the forecast implies for that gap as  we go forward over the forecast period.  The gap growing at something like the growth  of the working-age population.  Beyond this, as Bill Poole has already noted in his question, there’s a wide range of plausible estimates of actual productivity grow th over the forecast pe riod.  And obviously if productivity growth doesn’t slow as much as expected, the employment gap would be commensurately higher for any given growth rate of GDP.  There is, of course, the hopeful possibility that at some point  rising productivity will produce a sharp further improvement in 36 of 107expectations of future income and that, in tu rn, will give an upward boost to the growth of aggregate demand.  But I don’t see any compelling ev idence that this kind of shift has occurred yet.   So bottom line, I come out in the opposite camp from you, Cathy.  While the Greenbook’s projections of the gr owth of aggregate demand seem  quite reasonable to me—and I think the staff’s overall forecast is the most likel y outcome—the labor market considerations I’ve just summarized suggest to me that we may not be giving enough weight to the downside risk on inflation.  I think Bob Parry’s questions had a sens e of the same sort of concern, and if others feel that way, I would hope that we  could find a way to reflect this in our policy setting later in the meeting.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My reading is that, in general, demand is coming in on the high side of exp ectations—not dramatical ly so but modestly so.  My Wal-Mart contact said that he does not recall a time in the last ten years when the situation was more confusing.  The internal data th at Wal-Mart has from the paych eck cycle and other information suggest that demand should not be as strong as  it actually is, with sa les coming in at a pace 200 to 225 basis points higher than had been exp ected.  My contact sa id that they have reluctantly increased guidance on sales to 4 to 6 percent, but they are nervous about that prediction.  He also said that prices for gene ral merchandise are falli ng at a rate of about 1 percent, but they had been falling at a rate of  about 3½ percent.  So, price changes are still negative, on average, but not by as much as before. My contact in the trucking industry said that the January–February period was much stronger than last year; the two months together were about 8 pe rcent higher, and for February 37 of 107business was up 9 percent.  The availability of drivers is very tight.  He said that his firm is increasing its capital spending this year over last year; planned expenditures are $250 million for 2004 versus $180 million last year. Probably the most upbeat of my contacts was from FedEx.  He said that they see a very clear, progressive strengthening of demand.  Year-over-year monthl y comparisons for its domestic express business thus far in 2004 were January, down 2.1 percent; February, up 2.1 percent; and so far in Marc h, up 4.0 percent.  Ground busine ss was up 0.5 percent in January, 4.6 percent in February, and 8 per cent in March.  So he sees progr essive strengthening there.  He also reported that the sales staff sees the pipe line as full, with both current customers and new customers.  FedEx is now, for the first time in a while, discussing expanding its capital expenditures. They had expected their capital spending to be flat but are now talking about increases of 10 to 12 percent.  He also said, in terms of international business, that for the first time in this recovery period the year-over-year change in U.S. outbound traffic is now positive.  He pointed out, too, that they believe they’ve about reached the limit of output increases with their existing labor force.  They anticipate hiri ng more workers, although they haven’t done so as yet. UPS did not have quite as robust an outlook, but  business is generally stronger than they had anticipated.  One of the most interest ing comments I got from  my UPS contact, though, involved the growing burden of secu rity-related costs.  He said th at he himself now spends about 20 percent of his day on security i ssues, and a lot of his staff members are also very much tied up with security matters.  The Transportation Secur ity Administration is digging in deeper with various requirements.  He cited as an example th at their truck drivers ar e now required to—or are supposed to, anyway—lock the truck door when they go up to someone’s door to deliver a 38 of 107package.  That’s to ensure that  nobody drops something harmful into  the truck while the driver is gone. I’d like to make a general comment on inflati on.  In terms of the core inflation measure, obviously the idea is to take out the price changes that are tem porary.  But a good part of what we take out—food and fuel prices—is not temporary anymore.  The long-run oil futures are up substantially over the last two years—by $5 a barrel or something like that.  For all practical purposes, that part of it, looking forward, is no w permanent and not just  temporary.  There’s something to that; I understand that.  The food part of the inflation measures is heavily influenced, of course, by the dollar because food  involves commodities that  are traded in world would have to say that the best projection on the dollar is that it will remain about where it is now, though I know the Board’s staff believes so me further depreciation is in order. As I look at the kinds of things we would id entify as inflation shoc ks—where the effects should be about worn off—they are almost all in  the same direction.  Some examples, obviously, are fuel, commodity prices, health care costs, property and liability  insurance—a lot of companies talk about that now—and security costs.  All of thes e are shocks, and they may be about worn off.  But the fact is that they are a ll shocks in the same dir ection; I don’t know of any for which the prices are moving down.  So I thin k we should not ignore the possibility that we have an inflation environment that’s gradually going to be turning more adverse.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry. MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District is moving ahead solidly, with some areas growing quite rapidly.  Many of our retail contacts are upbeat about sales, even as they remain concerned about co mpetitive pressures holding down prices.  Housing 39 of 107prices have boomed in many parts of the West recen tly.  Low interest rates are part of the reason, but local economic conditions also are important.  House prices are up the most in Southern California and in the state’s Central Valley, two areas with relatively rapid population growth and expanding economies.  At the other end of th e spectrum, the hard-hit  IT centers such as Silicon Valley have seen little appreciation in home values.  Conditions in the manufacturing sector have become more upbeat.  Part of the boost has come from a pickup in exports, including increased sales of semiconductors to Asia.  Compet itive pressures, however, continue to force IT producers to cut costs.  That’s why Intel plan s to move production of flash memory chips along with 300 jobs to Oregon from its  headquarters in California. In some parts of the District, strong economic growth has translated into notable gains in jobs, though overall job creation has been tepid.  Our contacts say that health care costs are restraining hiring. These costs we re a central issue in the fi ve-month long strike by grocery workers that was recently settled in Southern Calif ornia.  That settlement will result in a shifting of some health care costs to employees, and it likely sets the stage for a similar outcome in upcoming contract negotiations in Northern California.  The cost of workers’ compensation also is a big issue, especially in California.  Governor Schwarzenegger wants the legislature to reform the law by the end of March.  If the lawmakers don’t deliver, the governor plans to put his own workers’ compensation reform package before the public on the November ba llot.  This is being taken seriously given his recent success in conv incing voters to pass two propositions that make up phase 1 of the governor’s fiscal recovery plan.   On March 2, voters overwhelmingly passed Propositions 57 and 58.  Proposition 57 lets the state issue up to $15 billion in general obligation (GO) bonds to finance accumulated deficits from the current and previous fiscal years a nd to supplement revenues in the upcoming fiscal 40 of 107year.  Proposition 58 is Propos ition 57’s quid pro quo.  Once the $15 billion is gone, lawmakers are barred from additional borrowing to meet budget shortfalls.  Moreover, they must put aside money to accumulate a state re serve fund.  Rating agencies a nd market participants seem encouraged by the vote.  Moody’s and Standard  & Poor’s upgraded their California outlook statements, and spreads on California GO bonds narro wed slightly.  State administrators have placed Prop 57 on a fast track.  An initial offeri ng of $6 billion in bonds is planned for early to finance its accumulated deficits of $8.6 billion.  Once the accumulated deficit is taken care of, the remaining bond allowance can be used to fund current and future spending.  Governor Schwarzenegger supports this option, wanting to a void drastic cuts.  But several legislators are urging tax increases or spending ro llbacks to restore balance.  With the state facing a $15 billion structural gap in the upcoming fiscal year, Ca lifornia’s fiscal health likely will require a combination of all of these elements. Turning to the nation, recent da ta have been mixed and taken together are moderately weaker than we expected.  While the data are still broadly consistent with the economy’s being on a robust path of growth, they do heighten concern about downside risks.  Disappointing payroll employment and consumer spending are part icularly relevant in this regard since the household sector seems to be the main source of downside risk to a robust investment-led expansion.  In any event, we have lowered our forecast for the current quarter to 4.3 percent and reduced our projection for the ye ar as a whole by 0.4 percent, to 4.7 percent.  Under this scenario, resource utilization would rise a bit over the year, and the unemployment rate would fall below 5.5 percent by the four th quarter.  Here the latest data on payroll employment and labor force participation continue  to raise questions about the amount of labor market slack going 41 of 107forward.  The most recent data on core inflation c ontinue to indicate that we are close to price stability.  Our expectation for core  PCE price inflation in 2004 rema ins at 1 percent, and for core CPI inflation it is around 1¼ per cent.  As I mentioned, the late st edition of the Blue Chip economic indicators includes long-range inflation pr ojections suggesting that  the Fed is going to allow inflation to rise to around 2¼ to 2½ percent ove r the next ten years.  Given that this is the last time I will participate in thes e meetings, I’d like to say that I hope the Blue Chip panel turns out to be wrong on that one!  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There has been little change in the economic outlook for the Third District since our last meeting.  The Phila delphia staff’s leading indexes of economic activity are signaling a pickup in growth in all three of our states over the next three quarters.  Current c onditions show continued improveme nt in activity in most sectors since our last meeting.  Retail sale s continue to rise at a moderate  pace in the District, but some of the improvement in February compared with a year ago reflects the damping effects of last year’s Presidents’ Day weekend snowstorm. Residential construction activity remains at a fairly high level, although there has been somewhat of a pullback in the first few months  of the year, which may be weather related.  Commercial construction remains hampered by high vacancy rates in the office market, but this is not a new development.  Manufacturing ac tivity in the region c ontinues to expand.  The index of general activity in our Ma rch business outlook survey, which remains confidential until this Thursday, will show a reading of 24.2 percent, down from February’s 31.4 percent but nonetheless indicating continued expansion. The more forward-looking indexes of new orders and shipments have trended down since the post-recession highs of December, but 42 of 107they remain at higher levels than during the first 1½ years of the recovery.  While the manufacturing sector continues to expand, it is not yet creating jobs—despite the fact that the survey’s employment index has reached levels that typically  signal job growth in the manufacturing sector. We explored labor market issu es in a special question of our  survey this month.  Nearly three-quarters of the firms said that they had job openings in the last three months, and three-quarters said that they expected job openings over the next six m onths.  Some of this reflects turnover, as about 40 percent indica ted that they expect a net increase in jobs over the next half-year.  Nearly two-thirds of the firms with openi ngs reported that they’ve had difficulties filling these positions, and most said it was because of a lack of qualified applicants.  This is a theme that came up in a couple of places.  Obviously, there’s an interaction between wage offers and labor supply, but less than 20 percent of the firms told us they had trouble hiring because applicants were asking for too much money, and le ss than 15 percent reported that the applicant had another opportunity.  These resu lts are consistent with the view  that at least some of the weakness in the labor market reflects a structur al change, a skill mismatch if you will, in the midst of productivity increases  and technological advances. The labor market remains the weak spot not  only in manufacturing but for the District economy as a whole.  The recent re-benchmarking of  the payroll data has resulted in a downward shift in job levels in Pennsylvania and New Jerse y.  Instead of showing an increase in jobs since the start of the recovery, New Jersey now s hows no change, and Pennsylvania shows a sharp Massachusetts, which was actually rather startling.  Delaware has fared better.  There was a substantial upward revision of job levels in Dela ware, but still we have seen no job growth in 43 of 107that state since the recovery began.  Overall, before the revisions, report ed job growth since the start of the recovery had been sl ightly better in our three states than in the nation.  But the new data release reverses the ranking, mostly as a result of job losses in the western part of Pennsylvania and in northern New Jersey.  At leas t I can still take comfort in the fact that we have not lagged the nation as we did in the 1991- 92 recovery.  I think that’s one of the reasons that my contacts in the Third District are posi tive and optimistic about th e recovery this time. Turning to the nation, my overall assessmen t of economic conditions and the outlook for the national economy has not changed much from our last meeting.  Activity continues to expand at a strong pace, although employment remains soft.  Business investment has strengthened, supported by strong profit growth.  Consumer spe nding continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Thus, the recovery is achieving more structural  balance, which puts it on a more sustainable footing.  Core inflation remains quiet in  spite of commodity price increases.  The missing piece is employment growth, as many have said, but it’s difficult to see how it can remain missing for much longer, given th e pace of GDP growth.  Productivity simply cannot continue to grow at the extremely rapid rate we have been seeing.  My sense is that as output continues to expand, productivity growth w ill decline and employme nt growth will pick up to a moderate pace this year.  This is sim ilar to the current Greenbook forecast, which revised downward the pace of employment increases from th e January forecast.  As is true for everyone here, I’ve been quite interested in gaining more insight into the labor mark et situation.  To that end I spoke to a large payroll pr ocessor with a significant presence in our District.  The company processes 16 to 17 percent of all paychecks in the United States and has as clients a range of different-sized firms.  Their data on the number of  pays processed show that small firms, defined as having 50 or fewer employees, have been adding  workers over the last six months while large 44 of 107firms with over a thousand employees per firm have  continued to cut workers.  Payrolls at mid-sized firms have been about flat.  The company’s data also indicate that wage growth has picked up in the last couple of months a nd that the amount of overtime pa y has been rising.  In the past, this pattern of employment and in come growth has been an early indicator of a future rise in employment.  Certainly, there’s some risk that it might not come to pass, but these are hopeful signs and a new data set to look at.   Even in the wake of the weak employment da ta, in my view the downside risks to the outlook are considerably smaller than was the case a year ago.  And I continue to view the risks to output growth as balanced.  In fact, if we  had better employment numbers, I would be more concerned about the risks on the upside.  Given the current state of the economy and the outlook, I see no reason to change our curr ent policy stance.  But I’d encour age us to continue discussing the conditions that would cause us to adjust policy and the steps we need to take now to ensure that we have maximum flexibility  to respond to changing events.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent economic developments in our Southeast region continue to be positive.  Retailers are reporting that sales are still running well above year-ago levels.  Our important tourism a nd hospitality industry has improved further, and reports are now quite positive, especially from So uth Florida.  Unusually cold weather in the North has resulted in a larger-than-usual migra tion of snowbirds from Canada, and a weaker dollar has stimulated an influx of foreign visitors from Europe.  Low mortgage rates continue to buoy our single-family housing markets.  And we’re seeing small improvements in selected segments of the nonresid ential sector, mainly due to institutional construction.  While vacancy 45 of 107rates remain relatively high in most of our large office space markets, it appears that both office and industrial markets have at least stabilized.   The sentiment of our regional business lead ers remains positive and upbeat, and we are hearing some of the same reports  on capital spending, particularly for software and equipment, as are reflected in the national data.  Our bankers , unlike those in Al Br oaddus’s District, are generally disappointed that the business borrowing they thought they saw in the pipeline earlier in the year has often not material ized.  Apparently, much of the capital spending in our region is being financed out of profits. We cannot shed much new light on the disa ppointing employment picture from what we are seeing and hearing.  Most of the job growth we’re able to tr ack in our region is coming from Florida, and much of that is in low-skill jobs in the hospitali ty industry.  A few manufacturing firms report that they are adding to payrolls.  Ironically, and paralleling the comments of Cathy and Tony, several of our District directors and Small Business Advisory Council members reported a shortage of highly skilled workers, such  as engineers and computer specialists.  We even heard reports of difficulty finding good work ers for minimum-wage jobs in the service sector in some areas of the region. We keep looking to our directors and other contacts for indi cations of imbalances and pricing pressures that they might see developing, and we ’ve begun to get hints of both.  A number of folks are expressi ng growing concern about potential overbuilding and worrisome speculation in the real estate ma rkets, especially in Florida.  Entire condo projects and upscale residential lots are being pre-sold before any c onstruction, with buyers freely admitting that they have no intention of occupying the units or building on the land but rather are counting on “flipping” the propertie s—selling them quickly at higher prices. 46 of 107The list of goods and services with outsized price increases is be ginning to grow.  In addition to insurance and health care, which have  been on that list for some time, we’re hearing about a number of others.  Builders have begun to complain about increases in prices for lumber and other inputs.  Trucking prices are up in the aftermath of some shakeout in that industry and new limits on driving time.  The large run-up in stee l prices is trickling down to end users, with some steel goods now being priced only upon shipment.  The higher oil and gas prices are being passed through.  My son, who is a re sidential real estate developer, reports that the cost of steel fence posts has doubled over the last  year and that the pr ice of asphalt is measurably higher.  He has now rewritten his lot sales contracts to be ab le to pass through such hi gher costs.  One of my corporate directors reports that not only has his use of auditing services nearly quadrupled but that the auditing firm had the gall to raise its fees!  Cruise ship opera tors, even with all the capacity they’ve added in recent years, have repo rtedly raised some prices and scaled back discounts and deals.  Although thes e selected price increases and the return of some pricing power in a growing economy are not expected to translate into higher near-term inflation measures, it has been quite a long time since I’ve h eard so much chatter about price increases.  I think it’s a reminder that, as supply and demand m ove back into balance in sector after sector, we need to be alert. On the national front, I remain very optimistic  about the outlook.  We do seem to be on a path with broad-based footing, and good growth over coming quarters seems quite likely.  Our own VAR models are suggesting growth close to 4 percent or perh aps a bit less; even so, those forecasts are still well within the new error bands provided for the Greenbook forecast.  I would like to join others in applauding th e staff for that refinement in th e forecasts that come out of the Greenbook. 47 of 107As most of us have suggested this morning an d at other times, the l ack of more-solid job growth is clearly disappointing.  While I think we  understand and can explain to some degree the sluggishness we’re seeing, it’s my sense that the error bands around expected employment gains over coming quarters are quite wide.  My own sta ff is of the view that even the scaled-back estimates and the later ti ming of job growth in the Greenbook could still be a bit optimistic.  Understanding the implications of that for our  forecast of GDP growth and for policy is important. Among the longer-term risks that I’ve emphasized at other recent meetings is the unsustainable fiscal situation, whic h others have talked about and wh ich is still not resolved.  In preparation for this meeting, my staff and I talked about the growing accumulation of U.S. securities by both the Japanese and the Chinese, as noted in th e Greenbook and discussed briefly this morning.  As I understand the numbers, their holdings now account for more than a quarter of outstanding Treasuries, and th e pace of acquisition actually has quickened.  It would be interesting to hear some more discussion about how those purchases have interacted with our own Desk operations and the possible implica tions for our policy and policy process should those governments slow down their purchases or let their holdings run off as they mature. Finally, in line with my earlier comments about the selected return of some pricing power as supply and demand move back into better bala nce, you won’t be surprised that I would judge the inflation risks to be balanced now.  While we  still have some uncerta inties and some drags on activity to work our way through, we  may not be able to be as pa tient for as long as some people think.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, the Tenth District  has continued to expand since our last meeting, and business contacts remain relatively optim istic about the rest of this year.  Consumer spending and tourism have remained solid throug h the ski season and into this period.  Housing activity has eased somewhat, as is  true elsewhere, but it genera lly remains strong in our region.  Manufacturing activity also continues to strengthen, as producti on, new orders, and employment all have risen.  In other positive news, manufactur ing firms reported a further increase in capital spending and in spending plans.  And business leaders express optimism about economic growth over the rest of this year thr oughout our region, with stronger f eelings in the eastern part—in Kansas City and that area—and a little less optimism in the Denver area. Commercial real estate has remained wea k, and most firms continue to show less enthusiasm for new hiring than for capital spending.  There seems to be a sense that the cost of capital is less than the cost of  labor and that, therefore, it make s sense to go with the capital spending.  I’ll give you one piece of anecdotal data in support of that.  Located in our region is a major distributor of propane across the United States.  They have used new technology—call center, global positioning, and communications technology—to move their product from starting point to distribution point.  Using this technology, they are anticipating, to begin with, a reduction of at least 10 percent of their drivers and, longer run, as much as 25 percent because of the improvements in moving out their product.  Th ey came to the conclusion that investing in this technology produced a much greater return on cap ital than continuing to operate in the old way.  I think that’s part of what we continue to see in the job market.  Let me also mention that we are hearing more anecdotal reports of delays in the ability to bring orders forward.  When firms order goods to be used in manufacturing, they  are experiencing longer delays in receiving 49 of 107those goods.  So in that sense the environment is fairly strong in terms of our experience with economic growth. At the national level, activity continues strong.  Our projection in comparison to the Greenbook forecast has no major differences.  On average, for 2004-05 we’re in the same range of about 4½ percent GDP growth.  What I w ould say to you here—although I’m not advocating any immediate change in our policy stance—is that  I think conditions are developing that could allow future price pressures to emerge.  First of all, both monetary policy and fiscal policy, as everyone knows, have been delivering quite a bit of  stimulus.  As one person said, “There’s a lot of yeast in this dough, and it’s moving.” I would also say that the anecdotal reports sugge st that we are going to see more delays in deliveries—barring shocks, obviously.  And there is more talk of passing on price increases; that is becoming much more prevalent than it was just  two or three months ago, or actually even a month ago.  So I’m wondering, in terms of positi oning ourselves in the se nse of our ability to move rates up, if being tied to developments in the job market is  really in our longer-run best interest.  We may have to be alert to this em erging situation as capit al spending continues to bring us greater productivity increases.  Despite  some views to the contrary, I think that inflationary pressures may emerge befo re the job market turns around.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The trends that have been evident in the District economy for some time are continuing, so economic activity is expanding further.  Let me just start with inflation where, at least in our District, to date there seem to be few signs of any broad-based price pressures and no real concern about infl ation, although there are some 50 of 107concerns about prices of particul ar products and services.  I’ll say a bit more about that in a minute. One distinct bright spot in th e District is spending on equipment and software.  That has become evident over the last several months, and based on the anecdotal reports we’ve been getting, the strength in such spending continue s.  Interestingly, the st ate and local government budget situation has not turned  out to be quite as dire  as earlier expected.  Th at is due in part, of course, to policy changes that were made and in some cases to the fact that revenues are running above earlier projections.  There is, however, a tr ansit strike under way in the Twin Cities, and the principal issue there seems to  be benefits—especially who is  going to pay for the cost of health benefits. Both manufacturing and mining in the District  are expanding, and employment is going up modestly in those two sectors.   Maybe more important in terms of the labor market situation, there really is little talk from our sources thes e days of further large reductions in payrolls.  That’s certainly consistent with what we’re seei ng in the initial claims data.  So at worst, employment is stabilizing; at be st, it’s growing in some industrie s.  Consumer spending has been reasonably strong thus far this year, but people are getting more concerned about higher energy prices, and the implications of that for home h eating and gasoline bills ma y curtail discretionary expenditures going forward.  So far, though, there doe sn’t seem to be any significant evidence of reduced spending, as best I can j udge.  And finally, in construction, housing does remain a bright spot in our area.   As far as the national economy is concer ned, I have only a few comments to make because I haven’t changed my outlook for the nati onal economy at all.  I believe the outlook is quite positive, and the in coming data haven’t provoked me to reassess that view.  While I would 51 of 107describe the incoming data on the national economy  as positive, they perh aps are not as positive as some expected earlier.  But I do think th ere’s a danger in over-emphasizing high-frequency data.  There’s a lot of noise in them.  We’ve all had a lot of experience looking at data that seem to tell one story one month and a different story tw o or three months later, after some additional observations and revisions.  F undamentally, I think that the na tional economy is in good shape and that we can look forward to goo d growth both this year and next. I have one final comment, and that is on the productivity issue.  I’v e been suspicious for some time about the deceleration in productivity projected in the Greenbook.  It has been pushed off a bit.  But to the extent that what we ar e seeing turns out to be more fundamental—more secular rather than cyclical—the implications are either for the same growth in GDP and smaller employment gains or for more-rapid growth in real GDP.  In any event, though, I for one hope that rapid productivity gains continue.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in the Fourth District have continued to strengt hen since our last meeting.  My business contacts are telling me that their order books are beginni ng to fill up, and bankers are sayi ng that their commercial loan portfolio pipelines are also filling up.  The busin ess executives that I’ve s poken to since the last meeting are still finding excellent  opportunities to increase pr oductivity, and they are spending on capital equipment with that goal in mind.  As many others who have spoken ahead of me already said, most of the anecdotal informa tion on capital spending is that businesses are spending on computers, computer networking equipment, and software.  However, I just learned that a major steel producer is going to rest art a basic oxygen furnace and continuous caster operation in Cleveland to satisfy  the growing global demand for steel.  And it was only four 52 of 107months ago that the domestic steel producers were  lobbying for an extension of steel tariffs.  Other business contacts are telling me that it’s no longer possible to scoop up at distressed prices some of the nearly new machine tool equipment th at’s out there.  My contacts seem to be saying that all of the good ba rgains are now gone. In my discussions with District business executives about their hiring plans, I’m still hearing a great deal of reluctan ce to add people to the payrolls.  Business managers have become very adept at expanding output with out adding to the workforce; as  others have said, firms are using new technology and are redesigning their busi ness processes.  And it ’s not just that new hires add to wage and benefit co sts.  I’m hearing executives say that, by holding down their head count, everyone in the company is becoming more  creative about ways to  increase productivity. Large companies—and increasingly medium -sized companies—are expressing an interest in and have more and more experience with outsourcing to foreign suppliers.  In some cases they are getting manufactured components fr om foreign suppliers, but in other cases they are getting services, such as software developmen t, call centers, back office operations, and even some research and legal services.  I, too, don’t want to make a lot of this or overstate the amount of activity that is moving offshore, but I am amazed at the number of new instances I keep hearing about, especially from medium-sized an d smaller companies.  What this growing volume suggests to me is that businesses continue to feel intense pressure to  rethink their business operations.  I believe that this kind of restructuring we’ve been hearing about is still going on, and I think it’s going to continue to  boost the pace of productivity growth. I reported at our last meeting that several of my business contacts were dealing with rising prices, and that trend has accelerated.  In mo st instances the price increases continue to be in commodities, construction materials, and meta ls.  But I’m hearing more reports now that 53 of 107many firms are able to pass some of these price increases on, a point others have mentioned as well.  Even though we know that there has been little effect from thes e price increases on goods at the retail level, for the first time I am hearing people say that they are more willing to contemplate passing on some of these price increases.  That suggests to me that this long period of disinflation we’ve been livi ng through is bottoming out.  I know that in an economy where we think there is still a c onsiderable amount of slack it would be unusual for inflationary pressures to emerge at this point.  However, the rising prices of commodities, en ergy, housing, and health care combined with the falling dollar and a ve ry accommodative macro policy have led to a situation that is beginning to generate some c oncerns among my directors,  and that also worries me.  I do think that monetary policy appears to be on the right course, bu t I hope that we’re not confronted with a situation where our preoccup ation with weak labor markets leads us to discount the inflationary signals that  may arise.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. REINHART.2  Mr. Chairman, in front of you is a chart of the forward rate yield curve that you spoke about during Dino’s briefin g. The red line is the ten-year-ahead one-year-forward rate less the one-year ra te, and the black line duplicates the line that Dino showed on his chart.  And, yes, it is the case that the spread is quite high when we look at it in forward rate terms, and the amplitude of the swings is greater.                                                  2 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). 54 of 107

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s interesti ng that the red line in 2001-04 is rising whereas the other one is flat, wh ich of course reflects our moving the funds rate down.  That alters the meaning of the ch art.  Anyway, Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent data have underlined the virtues of patience in our current monetary  policy strategy.  Demand has b een strong— I’m about to line up against my colleagues to my right, so to speak, [laughter] though not all of my colleagues—but it has been slightly less than  expected; and importantly that demand is feeding through to the labor markets even more slowly than anticipated.  One e ffect of this combination is to leave the economy with a somewhat larger es timated output gap last quarter and this quarter and one that is closing more slowly than we’d like.  Moreover, the decline in equity prices and the widening in a few risk spreads indicate some retrenchment in private-sector optimism, which is echoed in consumer confidence surveys and perhaps, based on the information that President Moskow provided from the business people he talked to, in  business confidence as well.  One can’t help but believe that higher energy prices, perhaps te rrorism risks, and job market weakness are contributing to a slightly more sober outlook.  After declining for three years, underlying inflation may be flattening out, as the Greenbook st ates, but the evidence seems inconclusive to me.  The three-month rate of core PCE has come  up, but from an extraordinarily low level, and core CPI continues to decelerate. I agree with the staff that recent data and attitude shif ts aren’t surprising enough to suggest a change in the basic story.  Although housing has come of f the boil a little faster than anticipated, consumption is only a tad weaker than projected; its rate of growth seems to be picking up from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.  To date, tepid labor markets, higher energy prices, and low saving rates don’t seem  to be exerting much restraint on household 55 of 107expenditures.  Most notably, business spending on  capital equipment remains quite strong, with no signs of tapering off.  And the pickup in indus trial production, still fa vorable readings from purchasing managers, and sharp increases in commod ity prices all indicate that the turnaround in manufacturing is continuing, even if a little less rapidly than an ticipated.  All in  all, evidence suggests that monetary and fiscal stimulus is continuing to bolster pr ivate demand, which with government spending also rising should keep overall growth brisk.  Accommodative policy should also narrow the output ga p—and faster than it has been.  I don’t have any new insights here.  Every logical argument indicates that a gr adual strengthening of labor  markets should be in train, but we haven’t seen much of it yet, wh ich in my view reinforces the arguments for remaining patient. Nonetheless, some observers have been argui ng that our patience s hould be wearing thin sooner rather than later.  One argument is th at policy is very accommodative by historical standards and that many of the reasons for a dopting such an accommodative policy no longer pertain.  Demand has strengthened substantially, and the threat of pern icious deflation has receded.  A second concern is that policy a ccommodation—and the expectation that it will persist—is distorting asset prices.  Most of this distortion is deliberate an d a desirable effect of the stance of policy.  We have attempted to lo wer interest rates below long-term equilibrium rates and to boost asset prices in order to st imulate demand.  But as members of the Committee have been pointing out, it’s hard to escape the suspicion that at least around the margin some prices and price relationships  have gone beyond an economica lly justified response to easy policy.  House prices fall into this category, as do risk spreads in some markets and perhaps even the level of long-term rates themselves, which many in the market perceive as particularly depressed by the carry trade or foreign central bank purchases. 56 of 107If major distortions do exist, two types of  costs might be incurred.  One is from a misallocation of resources encouraging the buildi ng of houses, autos, and capital equipment that won’t prove economically justified under more -normal circumstances.  Another is from the possibility of discontinuities in economic activity  down the road when the adjustment to more-sustainable asset values occurs.  Neither of thes e concerns, in my view, is sufficient to overcome the arguments for remaining patient awhile longer. First, the current degree of policy accommodation seems consistent with macroeconomic stabilization and a sensible approach to uncer tainty.  Policy may be unusually accommodative by historical standards; but those st andards, for a variety of reasons, haven’t been a very good guide to recent developments in that the stance of policy has yet to result in a material decline in labor inflation.  Uncertainty in the current situation se ems greatest about the rate  of growth of potential GDP, as President Poole pointed out, as well as the level of the output gap and how the gap will be reduced. This uncertainty argues, in my view, for awaiting firm and convincing evidence both that labor market slack is on a d eclining trend that is likely to be sustained after rates rise and that inflation has stabilized before considering policy action.  The former will tell us something about the relationship of demand to potential supp ly and the latter that the remaining output gap isn’t that large. Second, maintaining highly accommodative policy seems consistent with a risk-management framework to possible deviations from the most likely outcomes.  The low level of inflation and the high level of the output gap m ean that the welfare co sts of economic growth running a little stronger than expect ed are considerably lower than  the welfare costs of it running a little weaker than expected. 57 of 107Third, I believe that at least for a while the macro imperatives are likely to outweigh any threat to financial or longer-term economic stability from accommodative policy.  Any unusual distortions in asset prices that might intensif y a subsequent correction are probably small.  Domestic risk spreads aren’t obviously too lo w for the beginning of an economic expansion.  The upward tilt of the implied pa th of forward rates and note a nd bond yields looks relatively gentle.  The level of those rates may be a bit low, but they don’t seem way out of line unless activity is much stronger or infl ation much higher than I anticipat e.  House prices are elevated relative to rents—and will look ev en more so when rates begin to rise—but are more likely to correct by rising less rapidly than by crashing.  E ggs will get broken when rates begin to rise, but the capital in most intermediaries is high, and the system is resilient.   While central banks in the United Kingdom and Australia seem to be tilting policies in a firming direction owing to asset-price concer ns, those economies are generally operating at higher levels of resource utiliza tion than we are, and their hous e-price inflation has been much higher than ours.  In our situation, a high burde n of proof would seem to be on policies that would slow the expansion, leaving more slack and less inflation in the economy in the intermediate run to avoid hypothetical instabilit ies later.  In short,  Cathy, I understand your concerns, but until the labor market takes a more definitive and sustained turn for the better or until inflation looks as if its trend has changed, I’d be quite hesitant about allowing such concerns to have an effect on policy.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Fi rst, I’d like to compliment the staff on the new uncertainty calculations.  It’s very im portant to have them b ecause without them one tends to measure uncertainty by comparing forecast s.  Since forecasters talk to each other and 58 of 107probably talk in terms of means, this what I’l l call “conversational appr oach” greatly understates true uncertainty.  Now the staff is giving formal statistical estimates of uncertainty.  I like the graphics, too, because we have an estimate of where the alternative simulations fit in these uncertainty bounds. On the forecast itself, we may be getting to the end of a swing of upgrading.  For the past half-year or so, most data have come in ahead of expectations, and most forecasts were steadily upgraded.  This is the first meeting in some  time where the Greenbook has actually downgraded the forecast, albeit only slightly.  The main reason, of course, was a disappointing employment growth number, but some other indicators are showing a bit of weakness as well.  While the Greenbook forecasters have downgraded their estimat es, the Blue Chip forecasters are not there yet; they are still upgrading.  This  suggests a new way to evaluate forecasters—not only in terms of group mean square errors but al so in terms of how al ert they are to picki ng up turning points.  Since I’ve been here, I have a general sense that those prepar ing the Greenbook are pretty alert—much more so than the Blue Chip forecasters— but this matter should be studied further.  Moreover, it’s way too early to te ll whether this recent downgrade is  a mere blip or the start of something more meaningful.  Nevertheless, th e new development certainly bears watching.  Since the basic economic situa tion is so little changed, and since I speak after Don who leaves me very little new to say, [laughter] there is not much to talk about here that has not already been discussed many times over today or at  a previous meeting.  Let me focus instead on the macro implications of an i ssue that all of a sudden has become hot politically—the potential widening of the income distribution.   Typically in recoveries, the income distri bution closes, as lower-income workers gain more than higher-income workers.  This time it seem s that the pattern will be reversed, as indeed 59 of 107it was in the ’80s.  Evidence that the income disparities will soon widen is all around us.  Profits are very high relative to wages.  The Greenbook shows that the price ma rkup on unit labor costs is at a record high.  The profit shar e of total output is at least at a cyclical peak, and wage growth remains relatively sluggish.  Based on data now availa ble, I’m fairly sure that income disparities will widen significantly in this recovery.  This in tu rn raises the question of what impact that will have.  There seem to be widening disparities am ong households.  From the financial statistics we see that the wealth–income ratio is rising, but the financial obligation rate remains high, and loan-delinquency rates have risen to a local high.  From labor stat istics we see that labor force participation rates are dropping, mainly among gr oups likely to be affected by the cycle.  Moreover, there’s a sharp rise in quit rates for those who gave up looking for a job because they couldn’t find work.  Similarly, the duration of unemployment is rising even as the overall unemployment rate falls.  There is a similar in come-related disparity in consumer sentiment.  Three years ago there was a 4 percentage point spread between consumer sentiment of median-income families and low-income families; now that  spread is closer to 10 points.  Nearly as much widening has been apparent on the high side of the scale.  Whatever consumer sentiment means—and I have never managed to figure out  exactly what it does mean—low-income groups now have a good deal less of it than high-income groups by a ve ry great margin.  [Laughter] While it is easy to find evidence that income  disparities are widening, it is harder to identify macro implications of this shifting distri bution.  Imagine first that  a dollar has shifted out of wages and into profits.  The marginal income  tax rate for workers is  20 percent, and the household marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is  75 percent.  These, by the way, are stylized Research and Statistics Division estimates.  So the drop in wages would lower consumption by about 60 cents.  If the marginal tax rate on pr ofits is 35 percent and the wealth consumption 60 of 107coefficient is .035, the 65 cent rise in profits would raise stock prices  by a little over $16 and consumption by about 60 cents.  It’s a total wash.  And it would even go the other way without the marginal tax rate differences.  One gets sim ilar results from a shift of income within the household sector.  Marginal propensities to co nsume for different income groups seem close enough that there is likely to be little change in  overall consumption from  the distributional shift apart from that due to differences in marginal tax rates. So while it looks as though a very significant disparity in the inco me distribution could open up, it is hard to find major overall macro eff ects from this source, apart from the unlikely suspect of different marginal income tax rates.  At  the same time, these conclusions are tentative.  The internal group MPCs are not as  reliably estimated as is the overall MPC, and there could be further effects on confidence, social tensi on, or who knows what el se.  Here again the distributional shifts are likely to be la rge enough that the issue bears watching.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  I’ll do this briskly.  Economic developments in the Second District remain quite favorable.  Business and consumer confidence have weakened some, employment has fallen a bit, and in our Empire State survey the forward-looking six-months-ahead expectatio ns show somewhat diminished optimism, but the numbers are still reasonably strong.  Manufacturers report stronger pressure on input prices, with particular concern in steel and energy, as many of you have said.  Perhaps more significantly, they are reporting high er prices received and expectations of more pricing power ahead. The parts of the New York business and fina ncial community with national and global businesses continue to report a reasonably posit ive view of the outlook.  They are a bit more 61 of 107cautious than they have been, less because of concern about actual diminished growth in demand or profits than because of uncertainty about the sustainability of the expansion if employment growth fails to strengthen, the implications of the political calendar on the economic policy debate, and renewed concerns about terrorism risk s.  Greater confidence in productivity growth is not leaving people with as warm a feeling abou t the future as one might think is justified.   In our view, the basic elements of the expansion appear to be on the same path as they did at our last meeting.  With powerful support from the forces of monetary policy, accommodative financial conditions  generally, and the structural  acceleration of productivity growth, we expect the economy to continue to expand at a reasonably healthy pace for the next few quarters.  Consumer spending may moderate a bit, but real income growth should continue to support expenditures at a comfortable rate.  We expect investment to c ontinue to strengthen at a quite rapid rate, supported by confidence in de mand growth, competitive pressures to upgrade, ample profit margins, and very favorable fina ncial conditions.  We’ve moved our forecast up a bit, but we are somewhat lower in terms of GDP growth for 2004 and 2005 than is the Greenbook.  The main differences are in the expect ed path of consumption and a larger negative contribution from net exports.  We see consum er expenditures slowing somewhat because we anticipate a gradual rise in the private saving rate—we are more opt imistic about virtue.  We are less positive about impetus from asset prices, in flation, and interest ra tes.  We also see productivity growth staying at a more elevated level longer and falling le ss than does the Board’s staff, and as a result we expect more-moderate employment growth.  On balance, though, we share the staff view that growth will continue at a level somewhat above what we consider to be trend or potential. 62 of 107In our judgment, the core inflation numbers are likely to remain low, but we may now have reached the point where the rate of increase will stop falling.  Unit labor costs should start to rise modestly as productivity growth moderate s, but the increases should be quite modest for a while.  We suspect that the surveys on pricing pressure and a growing ability to pass on those price increases mean something in terms of a dimini shed probability of further falls in inflation. On balance, we see the risks to this outlook for growth and inflation as quite close to symmetric.  Relative to our last meeting, the chan ces of a substantial ups ide surprise on output growth seem diminished.  And until we see em ployment growth strength en and unit labor costs turn, there will continue to be some chance of a fu rther decline in core consumer price inflation.  Even if—or when, I should say—those conditions materialize, we consider it unlikely that inflation will accelerate over the forecast pe riod to a range above our comfort level. So on this basis, we see monetary policy as  appropriately calibrated to these conditions, and we believe that could prove to be the ca se for some time.  However, the Committee’s success in convincing markets that it will be patient is  contributing to conditions in financial discomfort.  I think we should be uncomfortable now with the extent to which expectations of the turn in the fed funds rate have receded.  With  the overall risks close to balance, we have less need for and face more risk in a communication signal that is still interpreted as designed to hold interest rate expectations down well beyond the immediate policy horizon. This is not an encouragement that we act now to dial back that signal.  But we need to consider thinking about doing it soon, if only to increase our future room for maneuver.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 63 of 107

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  In preparation for this meeting, I focused again on business C&I loans, and for the first time in the two-and-a-half year s that I have been following that information source, we are starting to see some measurable gr owth.  It would be one thing simply to report that, but it’s quite another, at  least in my mind, to go back a nd think about how long it has taken for us to get here.  When I first began looking at these numbers, business loan s were in a decline.  From a decline and a sense of very negative feedback, they went to no new information and then to early indications of some bottom fishing and opti ons taking.  After that there was some talk of activity but no measurable activity and then some  activity but it was still not showing up in the C&I numbers.  Finally it is in the C&I numbers.  In addition, we have gone from a time when banks and the securities industry were clearly cu tting back on marketing and on their parameters for loan approvals to a point where they’ve become  very aggressive.  So, I think in a real sense this measure reflects not only the underlying econo my but to a certain extent the psychology.  And as Presidents McTeer and Moskow have indicated, there are indications that both have picked up.  So if one were to use the trend in C&I loan s as a barometer, it would seem to reinforce the Greenbook analysis of the st rength in the underlying economy, with the lag in employment growth being the anomaly.  We made a signif icant shift in our communication six weeks ago when we moved away from the “considerable period” language and expressed the need for patience.  It seems to me that patience is still in order in our communication at this time. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In  my intervention here, I’ll talk about three things:  first, what has happened duri ng the intermeeting period and how I interpret it; 64 of 107second, why it has happened or what the hypotheses are; and third, the implic ations in this room for policy. First, as all of you know, what has happened is that the data have been distinctly mixed, as I think David said, but somewhat on the downside or at least below expectations.  Three or four things have caught my attention.  Obviously , the labor market numbers have been somewhat weaker than we anticipated.  Importantly, t hough, demand for new vehicles has been a little sluggish.  Dealer inventories seem to be rising a bit.  I’m going to come back to talk about that a touch.  And housing activity, wh ile still strong, is also some what below expectations.  I think someone mentioned that there are thos e in the private sect or who put together something called a “surprise” index.  They’ve obs erved that, during the second half of 2003, the surprise index tended to be positive, which is  to say that the data came in higher than expectations.  Since December of last year the data, generally speaking, have come in below expectations.  So I think there is some warning si gn there that either expectations are far out of the line or the economy, while still strong, is not quite as strong as people had thought.  The staff has taken this on board by marking down their fo recast.  The output gap is probably up, and the employment gap is up.  The main focus there, obviously, has been the question of job creation, which has been quite sluggish. So why is it that, years after the formal end of the recession, we still seem to be dealing with what appears to be yet another jobless reco very?  That leads me to topic 2, which is why it has happened.  There are a number of theories an d hypotheses, and I’d like to go through them quickly.  One is that th e rapid increase in benefit costs has discouraged businesses from bringing on new workers.  I tend not to put a lot of weight on that since I think, by and large, benefit costs are relatively small compared with the overall cost s of hiring workers.  But there probably are 65 of 107some industries where that factor is important.  The other hypotheses that I’d like to spend a little more time on have already come up, with one ex ception.  One is that st ructural productivity growth may be higher than we ha d thought before.  I tend to put a little more weight on that argument.  Having looked at some other periods of increases in produc tivity growth, I think we’re in the middle of one of the strongest of those periods compared with the others.  Historically they have run up to twenty years or so, and this one started about nine years ago, so I suspect there may be more to come here.  One of the things we may be seeing with regard to the story on structural productivity is that it’s a little str onger than we had originally thought.  That said, obviously it will have to come off a bit for cy clical reasons in order for job creation to pick up.  So I lay that out as one option. Tony mentioned another option, which is a bit of a mismatch in skills, and that again may l ead to slower job creation.   But the third possibility—one that hasn’t be en talked about muc h—is this so-called business gloom.  I find that gloom frustratingl y psychologically driven, but I think there’s an analytical underpinning to it that  we at least ought to take a moment to focus on.  I have a concern that one of the reasons bus inesses are somewhat gloomy is that they are aware that much of the increased consumption they’ve seen has b een driven by stimulus and that stimulus is undoubtedly likely to wane during the course of the year.  That is  certainly the case for fiscal stimulus, though it’s hard to say with respect to monetary policy at this stage.  But since the expectation is for no further decreases in interest  rates, I think most people would say that the stimulus from monetary policy also  will start to wane a bit.  In the context of that uncertainty, I think businesses are concerned abou t how sustainable the growth in consumption is going to be.  They have been holding down hiri ng and also labor income.  No one has focused on it yet, but while real labor income increased in the fourth quarter of last year by about 2 percent over the 66 of 107previous period, that was the slowes t quarterly rise in labor compen sation last year.  The rate of increase has been slowing gra dually during the course of 2003, a nd that, I think, is a bit of a problem.  I believe that has played into th e relatively weaker, t hough still strong, demand for consumer durables—both autos and housing—that I no ted earlier.  Auto inventories are starting to build, and housing activity, while s till strong, is slowing somewhat.   Another point I’d make here is that the other factors that have been holding up consumption, including equity wealth and home prices, may start to soften over the forecast period.  So while consumption for households is still on a relatively stro ng footing, I don’t see it strengthening.  I think there’s a risk that it ma y weaken a bit because I suspect that all of the factors that have been supporti ng it are going to be weaker a nd not stronger going forward. That said, it’s clearly the case that businesse s continue to fix thei r balance sheets.  And we’ve seen an increase in capital investment, which I think is part of the productivity story.  So I don’t expect things to fall apart completely from  the business side.  But I do believe there’s a bit more downside risk than perhaps others in the ro om feel there is, at least as I interpreted the comments I’ve heard.  Don introduced the con cept of announcing how we’re lining up.  I guess I’m lining up with the Kohn–Broaddus view that  there’s perhaps a little downside risk. Now, let me go to the third topic—the implica tions of all this for policy.  As I listened today, I heard two or three different themes menti oned that I’d like to discuss.  One is the issue of inflation and pricing pressure .  I heard a number of stories a bout bottlenecks, speed effects, and so forth.  It struck me that primarily what we’re hearing about are a few minor imbalances in supply and demand in a small number of industries that may not have the ab ility to change their output as quickly as others.  But I’m not sure, in  the context of a wideni ng output gap, that those problems are likely to feed into inflationary pressu res that we really have to worry about.  I’m 67 of 107not denying that pricing pressures may be picking up in some area s or that there are important sure at this stage, in the context of a s quishy—that’s a technical term I sometimes use—[laughter] labor market, that we’re likel y to see a big pickup in inflation. A second theme involves the question of whether or not we are at risk of overstaying our welcome at these very low interest rate leve ls.  Don obviously has done a superb job in going through the technical elements of that, which I wi ll not in any way attempt to mirror.  I would associate myself with those comments because D on, after all, is a great former member of the staff and now a distinguished Governor.  But having said that, I would point out something that hasn’t come up yet—that, in the staff’s most recent assessment, the real equilibrium interest rate has come down somewhat.  So wh ile rates are at historical lows , monetary policy may not be as accommodative as we had thought.  As I noted, some imbalances may be building up with interest rates this low, so we shouldn’t be complacent about it.  But we should recognize that monetary policy may not be as accommodative as we thought. The third theme relates to communication.  The point I’d make is that markets are expecting very few changes.  Given how fragile the markets are and given my view that perhaps there’s more downside than upside risk, I would again caution that we be very careful about making any significant changes in our statement.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bernanke. MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will align myself w ith the Kohn axis— 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  As long as it’s not an axis of evil! MR. BERNANKE.  —which proposes that monetary policy patience is appropriate for current macroeconomic conditions.  However, the issue has been raised by Vice Chairman 68 of 107Geithner and others that our current policy stance may cont ribute to potential financial imbalances down the road.  The history of us ing the monetary policy instrument rate for correcting financial imbalances is a very checkered one, to say the least.  So I think the question arises as to whether there is some other tool or  instrument that we might use to approach the question of potential financial im balances, and that’s what I’d like to talk about in my few minutes. Many of the questions and comments we rece ive as FOMC members have to do with perceived and actual risks to financial stability.  Just to take a few examples, we have all on occasion been asked whether there’s a bubble in th e market for residential housing; whether the narrowing of risk spreads on corporate bonds is jus tified by reduced default risk or is instead the result of investors reaching for yield; whethe r household and firm balance sheets will remain strong when interest rate s rise; what risks to the financial sy stem are posed by the activities of the government-sponsored enterprises; and how Ba sel II and other regulatory developments are likely to affect the structure and profitability of the domestic banking system.  There are, of course, many others.  Such questions are obviously  important but are extremely difficult for each of us as individual FOMC member s to respond to, and certainly not in detail.  One’s inclination is to answer by painting a benign picture so as not to cause unn ecessary public concern.  On the other hand, financial conditions do change, and it’s  our collective responsibility both to monitor those changes and to communicate truthf ully to the public what we see. The central banks of most industrialized count ries have responded to this challenge by issuing regular reports known as financial stability reports, usua lly on a semiannual or quarterly basis.  Financial stability reports  give central banks and related institutions a means to provide systematic and objective information about financial conditions over a range of sectors.  I asked 69 of 107the staff to provide me with examples of such reports, and they quickly came up with copies of reports from thirteen different in stitutions.  For the record, here is  the list of major institutions whose financial stability reports were provided to me by the staff:  The Bank for International Settlements, the International M onetary Fund, the European Centra l Bank, and the Central Banks of Australia, Austria, Canada, United Kingdom, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Spain, and Sweden.  All of these reports are on the Web, an d I would be happy to provide URLs to anyone who is interested.   These reports are fascinating reading, and I commend them to you highly.  Indeed, most of them discuss the situation in the United States as well as in th eir own countries.  The material covered by the various reports is diverse, as you may imagine, as is the amount of analytical detail.  Typically, however, the reports begin with a general macroeconomic background and then present both data and qualita tive information on the financia l conditions of banks and other intermediaries, households, and firms.  Other sec tions of the reports discuss developments in security markets, international finance, and aspects of the fina ncial infrastructure including regulatory developments.  Much of the material in these reports is in the public domain, but the reports draw the data together and provide an analytic overview.  In addition, boxes, research notes, and even full-length articles on special to pics are included.  These reports allow central banks to present their assessments of financial conditions in a way that is both objective and responsive to the concerns and questions of the public.  By calling attention to emerging financial problems, as well as by focusing polic ymakers’ attention on them, these reports may even help diffuse potential risk s of financial instability.   It seems to me that we might want to consid er the possibility of providing the public with some type of regular financial stability report, perhaps as part of the Monetary Policy Report to 70 of 107the Congress or in some other existing venue or  perhaps as a stand-alone document.  I suspect that much of the material in the report would be easily obtainable as a byproduct of regular briefings in the Greenbook cycle.  However, as  I think under no circumstances should we impose an unfunded mandate on the staff, an assessment of  the marginal cost of providing such reports should be a key part of any investig ation of the possibility.  If ther e is any interest in the group in pursuing this idea either now or at some future time, I would pe rsonally be more than happy to work with the staff to develop a more detailed proposal for the FOMC to consider.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.   Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to  start by also acknowle dging the range of forecasts the staff has provided.  I think it really will help us be more aware of how variable the outlook can be.  As someone who spends a lot of time worrying about Basel II and advising bankers that they need to understand the variabil ity of outcomes, I’m glad to see we’re walking our talk and putting it in our own FOMC materials.  So, thank you. Since the last meeting, as many of you have sa id, the data have been mixed.  On net, our forecast is a little weaker in terms of GDP and employment, w ith inflation about unchanged.  Overall the pace of the recovery, while  still strong, is slowing.  In looking at this, I tried to focus a bit on the different sectors of the economy, and I ended up spending most of my time looking at the corporate sector.  As we ’ve been noticing since the second half of last year, corporate profit levels are rising quickly, and corporate cash flow is very  strong.  In fact, internally generated cash flow has been gr eater than capital expenditures for several quarters now.  Why is it then that businesses have increased their i nvestment in equipment and software but still haven’t picked up their spending in some other areas?  I think that th is gap in spending on different facets of their operations may come from a couple of intere sting aspects of their 71 of 107finances.  Throughout this whole period, corpora tions have been paying down equity on net.  Overall their balance sheets have strengthened in  leverage, but they are generating more profits than they can use and, ther efore, are retiring stock. Another observation is that corporate net issuan ce of debt has been quite large until very recently.  In fact, the numbers in the last couple of quarters are amazing to me.  While a lot of debt has been issued, we’ve also seen, as G overnor Olson noted, a paydown in bank loans and commercial paper.  So companies have been le ngthening their liabilities—taking advantage of the long period of low interest rates to help strengthen their financials.  In the last two months’ data, however, we’re seeing some changes.  We’re  beginning to see for the first time in a while commercial loan growth in the banking system and commercial paper growth in the financial due to the start of inventory build ing, but again, this has been ver y, very modest.  Corporations in effect are trying to maintain their high profit marg ins.  In fact, from the data in the Greenbook we can see that the Street expects double-digit earnings growth for corporations out into the next couple of years.  To the extent  that companies have very l ean, top-line revenue growth—and particularly with a limited ability to raise prices to get that revenue growth—they are struggling to maintain the bottom line. One of the odd things in corporate finance is that the wider your pr ofit margin, the harder you have to work on keeping costs down in order to generate earnings growth.  I think that’s in part what is happening now.  Fi rms are showing wide operating marg ins to the Street, the Street is extrapolating them into earnings growth, and thes e firms find that they have to scramble harder on the expense side.  What really makes me uncomfo rtable is that, of the government sector, the household sector, and the business s ector, we have net saving today in only one sector, and that’s 72 of 107the corporate sector.  Until the corporate sector turns from a net saver to a net investor, I’m pessimistic about getting very rapid growth going forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you very mu ch.  We’ll turn to Vincent Reinhart. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.3  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the material that was just handed out.  This is anothe r meeting about words, not action.  Your discussion about policy would seem likely to center on how to characterize the economic situation and risks to the outlook so as to retain your flexibility going forward.  As is evident in the current readings on federal funds futures plotted in the top left panel of the first exhibit, over the intermeeting period market participants moved closer to the staff’s assumption that the funds rate will hold at 1 percent for the remainder of the year.  Indeed, futures quotes  are now consistent, as shown in the top right panel, with the onset of tighteni ng being pushed back about three months—to sometime near year-end.    This message is similar to what prim ary dealer respondent s reported to the Domestic Desk in a survey last week (the middle left panel).  A ll twenty-three dealers anticipate that the stance of  policy will remain unchanged at this meeting, and about one-third expect no action until 2005.  The d ealers apparently do not anticipate any significant change in the language of your announcement, either.  It is also worth noting, as in the middle right panel, that mark et participants are fairly confident about the near-term path of short-te rm rates, at least as judged by the low level of volatility implied by options on Eurodollar futures.  This strongly held sense in markets that policy will be on hold for some time, along with the phrasing of the last announcement—and the sense of quietude in  many of the telegrams on the discount rate sent in by the boards of  directors of the Reserve Banks in the past few days—explains the lack of policy alternatives in the Bluebook, a document with the official title “Monetary Policy Altern atives.” To provide some pe rspective, the bars in the bottom panel parse the reaction in markets at  your meetings over the past five years into that owing to the surprise on the polic y rate and the residual, which presumably is due to the words of your statement.  Th e message to take from the chart is that words seem to figure importantly as to  how markets react to your decision.  You might think that we’ve taken that pr inciple to an extreme in the centerpiece of the most recent Bluebook, the table I’ve included on the next page.  The three columns of the table present variatio ns on the wording of the announcement according to your view of the economic outlook.  Alternative B, given in the middle column and explained in more detail on th e next page in exhibit 2, suggests only the most minor variation of the wording that would be required to square the statement with economic developments over the intermeeting period.  To be sure, readings on the economy of late have been disappointing, as is shown in the top left panel by the staff’s estimate of the cumulative effect on th e two-year Treasury yield of surprises in key economic data releases, similar to inde xes of market “surprises” that Governor                                                  3 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). 73 of 107Ferguson mentioned.  But the market reaction to such disappointments, on net, also produced, as shown in the top right panel, a significant decline in investment-grade corporate yields that worked to offset a de cline in share prices and an appreciation of the dollar.  Thus, financial conditions, on net, probably do not differ much from those prevailing at the time of the January meeting.   While encouraging the expectation of  more-accommodative policy would support spending going forward, the lags in moneta ry policy might lead you to believe such effects would mostly be felt when the economy was in less need of support.  As shown in the middle left panel, the period when any action taken today would have its maximum leverage on the economy is next year , when the staff anticipates that real GDP will be growing at 4 percent, follo wing this year’s projected 5 percent expansion.  With inflation tame, the Comm ittee might feel that preserving current financial conditions would best foster the achievement of its objectives.  Such an attitude is consistent with the assurance made in the last sentence of the January announcement, at the right, that the “Committee can be patient in removing its policy accommodation,” an assurance that market pa rticipants evidently took to heart in shaping their near-term expecta tions.  If that is the case,  as in the bottom panel, you could stress that spending is continuing to expand at a significant pace.  I’d note that the description of the labor market in the sec ond bullet is a little different from that in table 1 of the Bluebook. The feedback I got since distributing the Bluebook made me think that the Committee would be more comfortable relating that “although job losses have slowed, new hiri ng has lagged.” Such an announcement would likely sink quickly among the waves of economic news a nd be associated with little market reaction. Touching any other element of the January announcement would probably prompt a more sizable response, which is di scussed first for an easier alternative in exhibit 3.    As is plotted in the top left panel, th e simple summary of the Greenbook is that the staff now believes that the output gap will run about ½ percentage point deeper than previously expected.  That implies th at about ¾ percent of the nation’s resources are expected to go unused at  the end of 2005.  The fitful  performance of the labor prospects in the context of a poorly performing job market, spending may not fare as well as in the staff forecast.  The Committee might put some weight on an assessment of such adverse alternatives.  If the Committee’s characterization of the economy leads market participants to expect a tight er stance of policy and adverse outcomes for aggregate demand materialize—such as a compression of household spending—the cost in terms of lost output might well be higher than if the Committee seems to be inclined to ease and the economy snap s back quickly.  While investors do not expect action at this meeting, to be sure, as shown in the middle right panel, the distribution of possibilities for later this year implied by options  on Eurodollar futures rates has a noticeable portion of its mass be low 1 percent—and more so than at the side longer than currently priced into fi nancial markets, the Committee might want to 74 of 107highlight, as in the bottom panel, the darker  shades to recent ec onomic releases.  In particular, it could point out , as in the second bullet, that “resource utilization generally appears likely to remain somewhat below levels consistent with the economy operating at its produc tive potential for some time” and could even tilt the balance between inflation and disinflati on more clearly into  the negative zone.  While such a shift seems consistent w ith the last few weeks of data, the Committee might have more in mind the l onger sweep of your policymaking history. As shown at the top of your last exhibit, the real federal funds rate has been negative for the past ten quarters.  Although a fe w staff models woul d suggest that the equilibrium short rate may well be nega tive—that is the lower bound of the blue region—you may well find it disquieting to be in an area traveled rarely by central bankers who are favorably remembered.  [L aughter]  Moreover, the estimate of the equilibrium real short rate derived from financial market s—the thin line plotting the far-ahead real forward rate derived from  quotes on indexed debt—is now, and has been for a while, well above th e actual real short rate.    A sense that the staff has a more benign view  of the threat of a pickup in inflation than other forecasters can be gotten from the latest Blue Chip survey of forecasters.  Twice a year, the folks in Arizona ask about  expectations over the next five to ten years for several variables, including real  GDP growth (plotted in the middle left panel) and CPI inflation (plotted in the middle right panel).  As to the first panel, such far-ahead projections of output growth would seem to reveal private-sector economists’ notion of potential output grow th.  If so, forecasts  of potential output growth, with a median of just above 3 pe rcent and spanning a confidence range from 2¾ to nearly 3½ percen t, might be read as suggesti ng that pressure s on resources could emerge more quickly than in the staff forecast.  As to the second panel, and as President Parry noted, despite  the good performance of in flation over the past few years, longer-term inflation expectations may remain above your longer-run target and, judging by the dispersion of the respons es, may be less anchored than you’d like.  Words to express such cautionary notes are given in the bottom panel, with the important changes contained in the paragr aph assessing the risks to the outlook.  In particular, if you think that you may be more  likely to tighten than seems built into risk to neutral, from its current slight  tilt toward disinfla tion, and qualify your “patience.”  The latter could be done, as in the last bullet, by noting that “the Committee recognizes that the stance of  monetary policy has been quite accommodative for some time.”  That would likely be taken in markets as a marker that your patience was wearing thin.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Vincen t?  I don’t have terribly much to say because as others have indicated, most has been said.  Just let me point out a few issues.  The rate of productivity growth is beginning to slow; and over the last several months, the high-75 of 107frequency data show a marked deceleration from the elevated pace we saw earlier.  Thus far, however, that slowing has not been accompanied by much growth in employment.  So the issue is not whether the growth of productivity is fall ing; it is already signi ficantly lower.  The interesting question relates to employment and wh ether its recent weakness reflects statistical noise or whether there’s someth ing going on that we did not antic ipate.  I must add that an assortment of recent labor market data suggests that there was a significant pickup in February and March.  If that is indeed the case, it may be that the weakness in January and possibly in Committee members have increasingly discusse d the possibility that the persistence of low market interest rates is fostering increased efforts to reach for highe r yields in financial clearly, the longer we maintain very  low interest rates, if indeed  there is significant reaching for better yields, the more the liability side of busin ess balance sheets is going to be peppered with securities that may not be all that  viable in a rising interest rate  environment.  I’m not sure how we can evaluate that risk, but it is an obvious is sue that should be concerning us.  And I think that, more than any other issue, is probably what is going to move us eventually toward tightening.  The difficulty that I have with tightening any time soon is that the economy may not yet have reached the point where we can confidently say that this recovery is  fairly solid and robust going forward, even though the current data clear ly are exhibiting considerable strength.  Ordinarily, I would have hoped to move toward ad justing our risk assessmen t of inflation to full balance in our press statement for this meeting.  The reason is that, if we are beginning to contemplate a tightening action, we should gradually de-emphasize our reference to patience.  A 76 of 107move in that direction today w ould be consistent with contin uing to adjust our statements meeting by meeting and fostering a momentum that  might enable us at the appropriate time to tighten with a minimum effect on rates. My own judgment is that it would be desirable when we move to have been so transparent about our intention to  do so that financial markets will not respond all that much.  This means that we have a very interesting but difficult job to do in trying to alter the general attitudes in financial markets.  Ideally, the da y we move everybody should have a sense that our action is consistent with our previo us statements about the outlook.   This raises an interesting question about  whether we ought to be moving toward a balanced risks statement on inflation or stay where we are.  Before the data began to turn somewhat negative, I was hopeful that we could de finitely move in the direction of balance.  Now I’m a little concerned about doing so.  The reason is that, if we move today toward balanced inflation, we will e ssentially have created a sequence of doing something—not tightening, but moving in that direction—at ever y recent meeting.  That would then create a problem for us at our next meeting if we don’t want  to move at that time.  So, I am marginally inclined not to change our inflation statement at th is point.  But I must say it is a very close call.  The sole reason I would argue for not moving is  to avoid creating momentum toward a policy action if, indeed, the economic  expansion is slowing down. So I come out in favor of leaving the infla tion risks sentence uncha nged.  But if there is considerable interest in changing it, I would certainly want to consider the arguments for doing so.  I do think we would be taking a risk that I don’t believe we need to take at this point.  In my view we are in a position where we can sit with patience for a considerable period!  [Laughter]  I 77 of 107recommend that we change the language in the first operative paragraph of  our statement along the lines that Vincent has indicated but that we  not change the balanc e of risks sentences. What we have in the draft statement and what I’d like to put on the table for discussion is a first sentence in the operative paragraph that  talks about underlying pr oductivity as providing important ongoing support to the expansion.  Th at is not a change.  The second and third sentences incorporate some updating.  They read: “The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is con tinuing to expand at a solid pace.  Although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged.”  The fourth sent ence is unchanged and reads: “Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low.”  That’s all I have to say at the moment.  Comment s anybody?  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support your recommendation for minimal change.  I would, however, move to balance on the inflation statement, a nd I’ll tell you why.  In my view, that is certainly an accurate reflection of the probability distribution.  In fact, while I believe that the risks are close to balanced, my own judgment is that the probability of a ½ point surprise on the upside is a bit higher than that of a ½ point surprise  on the downside.  I also think, though, that the effect of that ch ange in our statement is going to be totally dominated by the next employment report.  We saw how large the reaction was in the bond market to the February report.  If we have another weak jobs repor t—or whichever way the number goes—I think it’s going to overwhelm the effect of that minor change in our inflation assessment.  In short, to me balance is an accurate reflection of the risks wi th regard to inflation, and I think the impact on the markets of our stating that is  likely to be quite transitory.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. 78 of 107

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I support your suggestion, Mr. Chairman.  I’m actually not altogether averse to going to balance on the inflation assess ment.  But given that we’re coming off a period of downgrading our forecast of eco nomic activity, I think I’d rather leave the statement alone for another month.  I’m not entirely averse to th at minor change, however, if that’s all we do. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I just want to clarify that I was not advocating that  we move rates at this meeting or even at the next meeting.  But I do think there are developments that we ought to keep in the back of our minds as we consider th e stance of policy.  Clearly, there continues to be an output gap.  And clearly, the incoming information suggests th at economic activity has been less strong than it was earlier, though it continue s to be strong.  And like everybody else, I don’t know why the pace of hiring has been as slow as  it has been or whether it will get slower or speed up more quickly than we expect. I could go along with your recommendation, Mr. Chairman, but I fall more into President Poole’s camp, and to some extent I agree with wh at Ned just said.  I’d  rather say that the probability of a rise in inflation is about equal to that of an unwelcome decline—use the phrasing in alternative C—because to me that more clos ely describes what the markets and others are seeing.  I think it also conveys a very slight edging up in our concern—not a promise of a move the next time or the time after that  or even the time after that—a bout how long interest rates have been as low as they are.  So, on the margin, I would come down with President Poole on this one. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I think it’s  a close call on whether to balance our inflation concerns.  But after hearing your comm ents, with which I tend to agree completely, I 79 of 107have a slight preference for staying where we are.   I think we’re in a situation today where the fewer changes in the operative paragraphs, the better. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Parry. 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly suppor t your proposal.  I also  think that it’s a very close call with regard to the balance on infl ation.  I must admit that recent developments in energy prices and the value of the dollar have led me to conclude that it probably would be better to talk in terms of balanced inflation risks.  But for now, I could support your recommendation.  I think a change in our statement about the inflatio n risks is imminent; it’s just a matter of exactly when it will be made. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, t oo, would have at least a mild preference for going to balance on the inflation risks.  The reason is that, as I listened to the discussion today, it struck me that we heard more anecdotes that seemed consistent with the possibility of building inflationary pressures.  So on that basis, as well as other factors, balance seems genuinely appropriate to me.  That’s where I would come out on the issue. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman, I could suppor t your recommendation, but I share the view of President Stern and othe rs in that the discussion around the table today sounded, at least to my ear, as if we do see the inflation risks as balanced.  In fact, I think we may have stayed with the phrase “unwelcome dec line in inflation” too long.  T hose words in the statement don’t seem to be reflective of the discussion we had this morning.  So I would have a preference for a balanced risks statement on inflation.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. 80 of 107

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It will come as a surprise to no one that I have at least a mild preference for st aying with the inflation risk to ward the downside.  In my mind, we haven’t yet actually seen evidence—we have a lot of anec dotes but no real evidence—that inflation has even stabilized.  It is true that core PCE has moved up, though from extremely low levels.  But the core CPI continues to decelerate ev en on a three-month basis.  So I’d prefer to be more certain that actual infla tion has stopped falling before I ca n be convinced that the outlook calls for moving to balance on the inflation risks. My second point is that I think we  all expect total inflation to decline relative to  last year.  At least the FOMC members proj ected inflation of 1 to 1¼ per cent this year, which is about ½ point less than it was in 2003.  Now, a lot of th at reflects a projected decline in energy prices, and perhaps it’s not unwelcome, but the total is expected to fall. And finally, from my perspective, in a risk -management sense, any decline in inflation from current levels—if it’s more than a tenth or so—is more unwelcome than any increase.  I think inflation is at such a low level that a d ecline has more welfare costs potentially over time than a rise.  I don’t expect much to happen, but in my cost–benefit analysis, the downside risks get a little more weight than the upside risks.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have just a couple of points.  First, I can support your recommendation, although I had a ma rginal preference for the wording “about equals.”  I think “about equals” is shaded somewhat to the left of “appears almost equal.”  That is to say, we have lots of words in the English language, and “about equals” is an epsilon to the right of “almost equals.”  My guess is that we coul d come up with another word if we wanted to.  81 of 107We could do this ad infinitum on a scale between “really equal” a nd “sort of equal.”  [Laughter]  So my preference on the wo rding is not a strong one. Let me take this opportunity, however, to make a comment about the Bluebook.  One of the changes this time in the structure of the Bluebook was the elim ination of the three options on changes in the funds rate.  I think that made ab solute sense, given wher e we are, but I also believe it could cause us a problem  down the road.  Other things be ing equal, I would prefer to have the three options presented, and we can dism iss them if we don’t find them relevant.  I say that because I can see a world so metime in the future, perhaps with a different Chairman, where there’s a minority view for either increasing or  decreasing rates and th e opportunity to support such a move is made difficult if it’s not in the Bluebook.  This is not to take away from the obvious decision we’re making this time.  But as a general matter, I think that it makes some sense to leave that stru cture in the Bluebook and spend the extra page on it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO.  Mr. Chairman, I also can support your recommendation on the language, given your comment that, if we make a change, the markets are going to view that as the first step in a sequence and will expect change s at our subsequent mee tings.  But I do have to admit that I also have a mild preference for going to a balance of risks on inflation.  Again, though, I can support your recommendation on the language. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I’d prefer that  we move to a balanced statement on the inflation risks because I think the risks in fact  are relatively balanced now.  But I would not choose to disagree with the str onger preferences that might be held by others around this table 82 of 107who believe that we really should not be maki ng a change at this time.  That’s the more important decision at this point, I think. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Wh ile I am sympathetic to the concerns that others have expressed, my view is that we  shouldn’t make any changes, and I’d keep this slight shading in the bala nce of risks language as it is.  I have  that view for a couple of reasons. One is that the market seems to be expecting very  little change and I see no reason to surprise the was a relatively small change—moving to the “patience” language—to give us some flexibility.  The market reacted quite strongly.  I’m not quite sure why we have to do anything like that this time around.  For reasons that you pointed out, Mr. Chairman, we’re not exactly starting on a new path just yet. Second, I would find it hard to explain, in the context of data that have been weaker than expected, why the Committee would alter its view of the inflation picture in the opposite direction.  That seems inconsistent with some of  the other language changes we want to make. Third, a point I made earlier, I think one’s assessment depends to some degree on one’s view of where we’re starting in terms of the inflation dynamics.  As I said, I’m sympathetic to the concerns expressed about risi ng inflation; we’ve heard a lot of stories and anecdotes about greater worry about inflation at a point when our own forecast is for output growth to slow and for the output gap to widen.  Again, that seems inte rnally inconsistent.  Therefore, I would leave the wording in the statement as it is , at least at this stage, and wait to see if the incoming data tell us how the forecast might change.  If we wait until May to make this language change, I don’t 83 of 107believe people will think that we are behind the curve.  So, for those three reasons, I would support your recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  First, Mr. Chairman, let me associate myself with Tony’s comments about the Bluebook.  I also felt that it was very  well thought out this time, but I would be comforted, Vincent, by your putting in all th ree options, which would indicate that we’re expected to have action alternatives  most of the time going forward. On policy, Mr. Chairman, I may be an outlier  even in the Kohn camp.  In fact, after I finish my comments here, I might be kicked out of the Kohn camp!  I guess I have an extreme view, but let me just express it because I think it needs to be sa id.  As I look at the economic situation, it seems to me that th e evidence we have on the labor market to date suggests that the slack in that market is not di minishing but increasing.  To me, that is fundamental.  I’ve been thinking about what is going to happen to the in flation rate and where th e risks lie on inflation going forward.  In my view Don made a very good point that there is limited evidence, at best, that disinflation actually has ceas ed and some evidence that it may be continuing.  I was also impressed by Roger’s comment in the economic disc ussion that, with the ki nds of imbalances we seem to have, there is a likelihood of increases in some relative prices.  I don’t discount those price increases entirely, but in this environment the risk that they will generate a quick acceleration of inflation still seems to me to be less than it would be otherwise.  So, I don’t think we’re giving enough weight  to the disinflation risk.  After long reflection, I have concluded that  we ought to give it greater we ight, so I’m basically in an alternative A mode.  I realize I’m defining the ex treme of the range of vi ews here, but I wouldn’t be satisfied even with the language  in alternative A as far as the assessment of risks is concerned.  84 of 107The statement there is that the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months.  I don’t know whether I agree with that.  I’m not at all sure that’s the case.  Therefore, my own preference—and, again, I rea lize this is an extreme view—is, first of all, to get the possibility  of an easing in policy in the statem ent, or at least to recognize that possibility.  That has been off the table now fo r a long time, and I think it’s time to consider putting it back on.  So the way I would write the two sentences, if it were my call, would be something like this:  “The pr obability of an unwel come further fall in inflation has risen modestly in recent weeks and once again appears to be somewhat greater than the risk of a rise in inflation.  Consequently, while policy eventually  will need to become less accommodative as the economy improves, somewhat greater accommoda tion may be appropriate in the interim.” 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thereby making the Chairman’s recommendation seem terribly moderate!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bernanke. MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate the anecdotes regarding price pressures, but I’m somewhat wary of them.  I think many of them reflect the salience of the commodity and energy price changes we’ve seen.  But first, we know  that those are a small part of total costs.  Second, there may be some conf usion between high costs a nd rising costs, and of course, only rising costs c ontribute to inflation. Also, I want to associate myself with Governor Ferguson’s point that the news since our last meeting has been primarily of a weakening in the expansion, particularly in terms of the employment statistics, and of a st rengthening in the dollar. The latt er has not been talked about a great deal, but the downward trend in the dollar has been arrested.  So, Mr. Chairman, I would 85 of 107like to support the statement you have proposed, with the bias downward, understanding that we 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I agree with your recommenda tion for no change in policy.  I would prefer balanced risks on inflati on.  I think most of the weakness we’ve seen recently has been on the real side rather than the inflation side.  It’s  just too much of a Phillips curve type of analysis for me to view the two as a tradeoff in that  way.  I would even suggest changing the word “patience” this time.  I agree with Tony that there ar e a lot of words we can us e, and I fear that if we start using that one time after time, we'll ge t in the same bind we did with the “considerable period” phrase. So, I would be happier if you had found a word that was equally as strong as “patience”; I think it would be helpful just to ch ange that word so we don' t get locked in.  Back when I played tennis, if you were about to receive a serve, you didn’t stand flatfooted.  You would keep moving your feet so you’d be able to go either way.  And I think the word “patience” leaves us flatfooted. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chai rman, I’m comfortable with your recommendation both on policy and on the statem ent.  I think it’s true that the anecdotal information on prices is worse si nce our last meeting.  But the numbers haven’t moved.  And our statement already reads that the risks on inflation are quite close to balance.  “Almost equal” is quite close.  [Laughter]  On that basis, I’m  comfortable with the suggestions you proposed. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.   Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Mr. Chairman, I support your r ecommendation, and I would prefer to keep the slight bias emphasizing that there is a possibili ty of disinflation.  One of the things that makes 86 of 107me uncomfortable about making a change—going back to my comment that I like the fan charts—is that inflation is “fa nning” around 1 percent, and I pers onally think 1 percent is a low number.  Also, there are economic consequences  of what is going on.  How companies manage their earnings statements and how financial institutions operate at extremely low interest rates have implications for the economy.  That, plus the fact that we ha ven’t seen in the data actual evidence of a stabilization in inflation, leads me to prefer to retain the bias toward weakness. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson.  

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  Mr. Chairman, if it is a close cal l as to whether or not we would bring the inflation risks into balance—and I think it is a clos e call—then I have a strong preference for changing the statement as little as possible.  It s eems to me that, in the past when we have made significant changes in the statement, the market  has overread their significance and has been confused about what we were trying to communicat e.  The changes that have been proposed for the statement today in my view reflect the minima l change in the outlook th at has taken place in the intermeeting seven-week peri od.  And I think we ought to go with a statement that suggests that the outlook has changed only minima lly.  So I support your recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This is a very cl ose decision actually—not so much in the numbers but in the fact that all of  us, as best I can judge, could go either way if we had to.  It’s just too close to call.  I thi nk Governor Olson probably correctly summarized where we stand.  And there’s a lot to be said for President Poole’s argument that it’s real ly not going to matter all that much because what will matter is what the data  show.  So in a way I think it’s probably best for us to do nothing and let the market essentially move the expectati ons on the federal funds rate.  Therefore, let’s have a statement r ead that essentially involves no change.   87 of 107

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  I’ll begin with  the directive wording, which is at the bottom of page 11 in the Bluebook: “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an aver age of around 1 percent.”  Moving on to the risk assessment, which is part of the formal vote, that would be the language  under “B” on page 12: “The Committee perceives that the upside and down side risks to the atta inment of sustainable growth for the next few quarter s are roughly equal.  The probab ility of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and no w appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.  With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its  policy accommodation.” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Since we will be approving the statement as well, could you distribute the draft statement, please, just to  be sure?  It’s in e ffect what Vincent had indicated, so I trust there are no surprises.  [Pause]  If there are no comments, please call the roll.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We now have to go back to the agenda item we deferred at the beginning, which was a discussion of the mi nutes of the previous meeting.  There were important issues raised.  Vi ncent, do you want to comment? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  In retaliation for the ha rd questions President Parry has asked the staff over the years, I will be delaying the start of his lunch!  [Laughter]  In doing so, I’ll be referring to the memo I circulat ed last night.  Commenting on the January draft minutes, one policymaker suggested trimming the first four paragraphs covering the Committee’s discussion of its communica tions policy.  Four others recommended that only paragraph 3, which reviewed issu es related to expediting the minutes, be shortened.  I’ve included the full set of comments beginning on the second page of the memo, showing potential additions in bol d and potential dele tions as bracketed material in italics.    Not to sound defensive, I started draf ting the minutes on the assumption that you intended to be transparent about your discus sion of transparency.  Providing a full and accurate record of the meeting seemed to require describing the different aspects of your discussion about the risk assessments, the minutes, and economic forecasts.  To my mind, the contribution of paragraph 3 was to lay out the pros and cons of expediting the release of the minutes—in pa rticular, the arguments against elevating the role of the minutes, including feedback on the Committee’s deliberations—which have not previously been well ar ticulated in the public domain.   That said, two changes do seem appropriate.  For one, the last se ntence of the first paragraph—that’s lines 7 through 9—c oncerns the working group, which was directed solely to arrive at formulaic langua ge for the risk assessments.  That sentence would seem to be positioned better in the second paragr aph, which is centered on the risk assessments, so that people do not read too much into the working group’s formation and dissolution.  For another, th e last sentence of the third paragraph—lines 38 through 40—suggests that it was premature to expedite the minutes, seeming to imply that at some point the minutes w ould be expedited.  On further reflection, the one-sided nature of that statement appear s presumptuous about your future decisions, suggesting that a more neutral description would indicate that you have not reached a minutes.    The rest of the possible changes have policy import, which is why I’m coming back to the Committee.  In particular, do you want to shorten the description of your discussions about the formulas for the risk  assessment, the minutes, and the economic projections?  You might favor such a cut on the grounds that it’s not worthwhile to talk about procedural issues in public.  Bu t the main points have mostly already made it into the press, and this offers you the opportunity to frame the main issues in a balanced way.  I would also add that reduc ing the discussion to its bare bones would offer more than a few commentators the opportunity for irony about the Committee’s 89 of 107views on transparency, something I certainl y wouldn’t pass up!  If you do, I take that as direction on preparing the next set of minutes.  That is, I should downplay today’s discussion of your prior discussi on of transparency.  [Laughter]  Let me close with this observation.  Given your decision to experiment with accelerating the production of  the minutes, you will not have the luxury of an extended discussion of the minutes for this meeting and those for the remainder of the year. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me first follo w up on your transparency assessment.  I think Cathy Minehan has raised an interesting po int.  I would say this:  We run the risk, by laying out the pros and cons of a particular argument, of inducing people to join in on the debate, and in this regard it is possible to lose control of a process that onl y we fully understand.  We have a ratchet in here where, if we were to move forward, we can’t go back.  So the concept of transparency is a very important concept but one  that should be approached with a recognition that we cannot move back and forth on it.  I’m a little concerned here that by raising certain issues we may not be able to backtrack.  I hadn’ t thought about it when I originally read the draft minutes, but in seeing the concerns that other pe ople had, I think there’s something here that we have to consider.  I do not recall so many people raising questions about the minutes before because I think most of us read the minutes passi vely.  That suggests to me that, if there were really a strong focus on them, we’d find a grea ter degree of disagreement among us about their content.  Now, I don’t know whether what I just said is true.  I su spect it is just on the basis of my experience.  What was it—four  or five people who commented? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Five. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I was not one of them, so I would make the count six.  It would be useful to discuss this even at the expense of delayi ng our tribute to our guest of honor—is that what we’re calling you today? 

[SECTION]

MR. PARRY.  The old guy! 90 of 107

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Does anybody have  any thoughts on this?  I must admit that I didn’t think about some of  these issues until I saw the comments others made, but I’m a little concerned about other people getting into the debate when they know far less than we do.  I don’t know what Michelle has to say on this but my impression is that, if we go in that direction, we may find ourselves coming to  a conclusion that is not base d on our best judgment.  She’s nodding in agreement. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Mr. Chairman? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. MR. BERNANKE.  I do have a concern about pa ragraph 3.  It’s not just a question of hiding or reducing the information available; I think that paragr aph actually misrepresents the substance of the conversation in that it seems to suggest that the reason for not releasing the minutes earlier is purely logistic al, which is certainly not corre ct.  There were arguments of substance on both sides, and to suggest that th e arguments against are purely logistical risks giving the impression that our convenience is more  important than revea ling information to the 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  May I make a suggestion?  This could get to be a very long discussion, and we don’t need that.  Do you have time to make changes? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I have all the time you want .  The Committee, however, will have to vote on the minutes.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Oh, I understand that.  Let me make the following suggestion:  Those who haven’t commented should provide comments to Vincent.  The reason I say that is that we may very well find that those who didn’t comment actually strongly support the minutes as written, and it’s important to kno w that.  We could then do—we’ve done this on 91 of 107numerous occasions on other matters—a notation vote.  If there is a problem in trying to find out who is where or what the issues are, Vincent can get on the phone and talk to each of you and make a judgment.  In my view, that’s the best way to resolve this, and I think it’s worthy of being resolved.  It’s an important issue.  

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  For the Reserve Bank members,  this will be the first experiment with notation voting electronically.  You’ll have to do that kind of vote in two weeks anyway for the minutes of this meeting, which we will be circulating at that time. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  A ny comments relevant to this? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I have a question.  We log in our preferences to Vincent. Then what does he write down as the final word, the majority vote? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  He will try to infe r from your comments, and I think we all trust him in this respect, a way to rewrite the minutes that he thinks will gain a majority vote.  Then we will find out whether he is accurate.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  A quick question prompted by Vincent’s last comment that we won’t have the luxury to have this t ype of discussion in the future.  A couple of meetings back, when we were talking about expediting the minutes, you s uggested that one way to deal with resolving comments to the Secretary was to have a subset of the Committee to help with the editing.  Are we going to talk some more about that?  As we  go through this experiment, are we going to use that kind of process, or are we simply  going to leave it entirely to Vincent? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, at this tim e the only thing Vincent will be involved with is finalizing the minutes for the previous  meeting.  That has not hing to do with how we proceed going forward on this. 92 of 107

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  President Guynn, in the ex periment with expediting the minutes, we’re going to post drafts of the minutes every evening so you’ll be able to see how the comments evolve.  Then we’ll de al bilaterally with Committee me mbers if people have specific comments.  When we talked about the possibili ty of forming a subgroup of the Committee, we ran into the legal issue that the FOMC cannot delegate matters of monetary policy.  If the minutes are viewed as a part  of monetary policy, you can’t— 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Will we see each other’s comments ?  This is the first time I think we’ve ever had the luxury of seeing who made what ki nds of comments.  Will we see each other’s comments, and by attribution, in the future? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Now,  wait a second.  May I ask a question?  If we have a subcommittee that is putting out a draft of the minutes to be vo ted on, none of us is in any way forgoing our legal commitments.  It’s the delega tion of the vote that’s the legal issue.  A subcommittee to facilitate that  process is, in my judgment —I don’t know what the General Counsel has to say on it— 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  I thought that’s what you sugge sted in earlier conversations. The idea was to have some group look at  the comments on the staff’s draft and make some shared judgment about whether the suggested changes should be made. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It doesn’t ma tter how it’s done because the ultimate appoint such a group, but that doesn’t  change the previous discussion. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further comments?  If not, the next meeting is May 4.
