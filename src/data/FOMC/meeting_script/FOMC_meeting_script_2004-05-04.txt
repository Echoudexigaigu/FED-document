CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good mo rning, everybody.  This is the last FOMC meeting that Al Broaddus will be attending.  I believe he atte nded his first meeting in 1973. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  In July 1973 , I’m told, Mr. Chairman.  But I don’t remember.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You don’t remember?  Well, I gu ess the FOMC didn’t make a big impression on yo u at that time!   

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  It made a bi g impression; I was just too nervous to remember. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We will miss you, but of course we  will have a luncheon for you after our next meeting.  Your official date of retirement is August 1? 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Right, August 1. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, whatever you ha ve to say for the future to the FOMC, we will give you anothe r 32.4 seconds to say it at this meeting. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  I’ve got mo re time for a last s hot then!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Would somebody like to move to  approve the minutes of 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So moved. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Withou t objection, they are approve d.  Mr. Reinhart, do you want to make some comments re levant to this set of minutes? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I’d just like to report on the first dry run of our ex periment in expediting the production of the FOMC minute s.  We were able to produce a proposed final version of the minutes and get all twelve voting members of the Committe e to indicate by ou r deadline that they were inclined to vote to adopt the minutes at the ne xt meeting.  There was no t a lot of slack in our 3 of 112 schedule, though, and we received the last of the members’ respons es as to their inclinations on the vote pretty close to the wire.  Two factors contributed to th e success of the experiment.  One was contracting for an outside professional to help provide a typed transcri pt of the meeting on an expedited basis.  That sped up the process of preparing the initial draft of the minutes considerab ly.  For another, there weren’t all that many comments on that first draft, so we were able to inco rporate them and turn out a revised draft in fairly good order.  One problem, which we had anticipated, was getting information to and from Committee members who were out of thei r offices.  Needle ss to say, we learned a few things about the pro cess, and we will make some mino r adjustments, but they will be in the background from your perspective. Once the minutes were ready, we asked Dave Skidmore of the Public Affairs staff to prepare some hypothetical headlines and the first few paragr aphs of a news wire stor y on the minutes.  Then Board and New York staff members independently look ed at that information as well as the minutes and tried to estimate the likely market effects of an early re lease of those minu tes.  The results, which should be taken with a grain of salt, suggested  that there could have b een a fairly substantial the afternoon of the outsized employment report, and perhaps would have reinforced the market reaction to the numbers released earlier that day. I’m sure you noted that in this  exercise we asked you to indicate whether you were inclined to vote to approve these minutes but not actually to  vote on them.  The reason was that if we had asked you to vote, we would have  to indicate in the next set of minutes that the Committee had taken a notation vote on that d ecision.  That’s why tw o and a half weeks af ter the meeting we’ll 4 of 112                                                  1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). continue to ask you to give us your inclination as to whether you would approve the draft minutes but actually have you vote on them at the next mee ting.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any questions for Vincent? 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?  It seems to me that we ought to consult with counsel as to whether the so-called inclination to vote c ould be regarded as being the equivalent of a vote and could create a problem in the future.  I think that’s something on which we should get some expert legal advice. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  We did. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Okay.  So it’s perf ectly okay to put it that way? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Virgil  thought that the wording of the request we sent around was perfectly appropriate. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Presid ent Geithner is proposing th e election of Joseph Tracy as an associate economist of the FOMC.  If there are no objections , I will assume that his request is approved. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Dino Ko s, would you start us off? MR. KOS.1  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll be referring to the charts that Carol Low just circulated.  In the inte rmeeting period, stronger economic data and rapidly shifting expectations brought forward the timing of the anticipated tightening cycle and affected a range of asset prices.  The top panel of page  1 graphs the three-month deposit rate in black and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed red lines.  The first move up in forward rates followed the strong employment report on April 2.  Th e second move was coincident with the higher-than-expected CPI data on April 14, c oupled with other i ndicators suggesting to market participants that inflationary pr essures were building.  Also contributing to the shift were comments by the Chairman and other members of the Committee—and even a former member of the Committee—th at were broadly interpreted as laying the groundwork for a tightening later this su mmer.  During April, the three-month forward rate moved about 35 basis points  higher, whereas the nine-month forward 5 of 112 rate moved up about 100 basis points.  Not surprisingly, the Treasury curve sold off, and yields moved sharply higher as well.  The two-year yield, which tends to be the most sensitive to policy changes, rose a bout 82 basis points between late March and this morning.  As shown in the middle pane l, the spread between  the two-year note and the target fed funds rate widened to 130 basis points, its wi dest level since the spring of 2002.  Just as a footnote, I would point out that there has been  a lot of talk about what would happen to bond yields if the fed funds target were raised.  What perhaps has been lost in the discussion is just how much  yields already have risen in only the last five weeks with the mere discussion of a possible tightening.  The bottom left panel graphs the two-year to ten-ye ar Treasury spread.  If the market were truly worried about inflationary pressures, one would expect the curve to steepen as the long end rises faster than the short end.  But the spread has not widened and in fact has narrowed somewhat—especially after the Chairman’s testimony.  Similarly, breakeven rates from TIPS have not widened and have also narrowed slightly in the past two weeks.  The market is certainly discounting higher interest rates; it is not obvious, however, that higher inflat ion is also being priced in.  The churning of positions and hedging adjustments as new data came in did cause a bit of congestion in segments of the market.  Turning to page 2, the top panel graphs the overnight repo rate for the on-the-run tw o-year Treasury note since February.  The Treasury Department auctions two-year not es monthly so this graph picks up each new issue on settlement.  It’s typical for th e on-the-run two-year note to trade slightly “special”—translating into an overnight financing rate a bit below the general collateral rate, which itself is normally a few basis points below the funds rate.  After the last employment report, the market rushed  to sell the curve, es pecially at the short end.  In that situation, those with short positions then need to borrow the security to complete settlement.  Given the size of the short base, the demand to borrow that piece of paper quickly pushed the financing rate toward zero.  The congestion also caused a rise in fails for this issue, and to a lesser extent some other on-the-run issues, though aggregate fails are still significantly  below where they were last summer, when the May ten-year note was in short supp ly.  The increase in the repo rate at the very end of April is due to the issuance of a new two-year  note that is trading more comfortably nearer to the general collateral rate.  The mortgage market provided another el ement to recent price changes.  The middle left panel graphs the ten-year yield in red and an estimate of the duration of outstanding thirty-year fixed-ra te mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in blue.  With the ten-year yield going from 3.75 to 4.5 percent, the MBS duration index nearly doubled from two years to more than three and a half years.  There was certainly some MBS convexity hedging, but  it probably played a lesse r role than it did last summer when duration widened very rapidly from about one-half year to three and a half years.  The thirty-year MBS spr ead, shown on the middle right panel, has widened in recent weeks, but it is still a long way from the highs of last summer.  6 of 112 This may suggest that MBS holders such as banks and hedge funds are still holding on to their levered MBS positions.  Corporate spreads, on the other hand, act ually have narrowed since the March FOMC meeting.  The investment-grade spr ead on the bottom left narrowed to about 90 basis points.  The better economy seems to be part of the explanation for the perception of improved creditworthiness.  The more pronounced move was in the high-yield spread, shown in the bottom ri ght panel, which narrowed about 70 basis points. The reasons are complex and not neces sarily consistent.  The better economic numbers, perceptions of improved prici ng power, and improved balance sheets are part of the explanation but are not fully convincing—especially given the weakness of equity markets and the widening of other spread products.  The narrowing of the high-yield index is even mo re paradoxical, given the wider spreads in emerging- Turning to page 3, the dollar is broadl y higher since mid-February, driven by many of the same factors that sent interest rates higher.  At least in this very recent period, the improved economic prospects in th e United States and higher yields have outweighed worries about the current account imbalance.  And while U.S. data have improved, European growth has lagged, and that divergence has shown up in interest rate differentials.  The middle panels show  the Eurodollar and Euribor futures curves out to June 2006 as of April 1 on the left and April 30 on the right.  On April 1 the Euribor curve was above the Eurodollar curve except at th e longer dates; by April 30 the Eurodollar curve had moved higher and had steepened and was trading above the Euribor curve except at the shorter dates.  The bottom panels graph the differential between a sampling of two-year major sove reign yields and th e two-year Treasury note.  All have narrowed in the past month—in some cases, dramatically.     The dollar’s recent moves against the yen are graphed at the top of page 4.  Since the last FOMC meeting the dollar has ma de a round trip, going from 110 yen to 104 yen by the March 31 fiscal year-end date and then back to 110.  One factor that did not affect the exchange rate during th e intermeeting period was foreign exchange intervention.  The Japanese Mi nistry of Finance last inte rvened in the market on the date of your previous meeting.  The change d tactics had traders scratching their heads initially, but they have since taken the vi ew that Japan’s improved economy has made policymakers more comfortable with the exchange rate.  The improved Japanese economy has also  shown through to fixed-income and equity markets.  The top right panel graphs  the continuing, if irre gular, rise in ten-year JGB yields.  The middle left panel graphs  for the past twelve months the rise in the overall Topix index and some of the dom estic equities not linked to the export sector, such as real estate, that are doing be tter.  Even more impressive has been the recovery of the banking sector.  The middle ri ght panel graphs the stock prices of the big four banks, each of which has risen sharply.  Mizuho and UFJ, which had fallen 7 of 112 in 2002 and early 2003, have risen about sevenf old in the last twelve months.  The latter appears to have been unaffected by the special inspection that was announced on the day of your last meeting.  Finally, equity and debt values in emergi ng markets have fallen in recent days.  In part that may reflect the implications of an incipient tightening cycle here.  But the other factor that may be at play involves an actual or pe rceived linkage to China.  Some emerging markets were affected firs t positively and later negatively by this linkage.  A few weeks ago the strength of many commodity prices was attributed to demand from China.  With strong signals in the past few days that Chinese officials are intent on slowing down credit and investment, these popular trades in some case had sharp reversals.  Non-oil commodity pri ces are one example; they have fallen in recent days.  As I mentioned earlier, the widening of the EMBI+ spread has been sharp, although as I’ve said in previous meetings many emerging-market analysts were wary of the narrow EMBI spreads even several months ago.  The bottom panel graphs a sample of major emerging-market e quity indexes, all of which have turned lower in the past week or two w ith the changed sentiment.      Mr. Chairman, we conducted no foreign ope rations in the intermeeting period.  I will need a vote to approve  our domestic operations. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The volume of fina ncing in the mortgage markets has come down very sharply and ha s stayed down for quite a long period now.  I would assume, and indeed you implied it, that hedges have already been taken on a goodly part of the positions held.  So the impact of a change in yields clearly has been far less than it was last August when the ma turity, as you said, went from one-half year to  three and one-half years, or what ever it was.  What is left out there to be hedged?  And what are the vulnerabilities in the ev ent, for example, th at we get another 50 basis point rise in  the ten-year note? MR. KOS.  Well, I think it’s hard  to identify what the vulnerabilities are.  On the downside, it’s the refinancing risk that is being hedged; on th e upside, it’s the extensi on risk.  As the duration is extending because higher interest rates are push ing off the day of possible refinancing, there’s a certain amount of selling that portfolios will naturally do. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But th at doesn’t move as rapidly as when we get a big interest rate move and there’s a huge option takedown  of mortgage positions. 8 of 112 MR. KOS.  Exactly.  We had a flavor of that in  ’94 when an unexpected change in interest rates caused a huge amount of extension hedging.  So, that’s always the risk.  Now, what will trigger it is difficult to pinpoint ex ante.  But certainly there would be some amount that would need to be hedged as rates increase. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Presumab ly there will be a lot of delta hedges moving in with that type of operation. MR. KOS.  Yes.  I’m looking at  Governor Bies, who may have some direct experience in this area.  But again, my guess is that there would be a certain amount of hedging that would still need to be done. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Mr. Chairman, you can see in Dino’s chart on page 2 that , when rates are unchanged and are e xpected to be unchanged, the dura tion of a thirty-year conventional mortgage levels out at around four  and one-half years.  So we have  at most about another half year to go if rates were to rise. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, that’s what hist ory tells us—that at the lowest levels of refinancing, duration has been about four and one-ha lf years.  But can that change in any way?  There’s nothing mathematically necessary about it, is there? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  No, that’s more a reflection of the mobility  of our population.  When rates are unchanged for long enou gh, the economic incenti ve to refinance goes  away, but people still do prepay their mortgages because th ey move or they trade up.  So, I think the four  and one-half years is not immutable, but it’s a reflection of deeper demographics. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  A reflection of the house turnover rate? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Yes. 9 of 112

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’m a little surprised that in y our charts New Zealand has all of a sudden become a ma jor international power.  Considerin g the fact that the yield spreads between New Zealand and Australia are locked, you must be trying to convey some subtle message here. MR. KOS.  Well, the only message  is that, with the euro havi ng brought together a lot of currencies into one, the number of currencies out there with floatin g rates has been reduced.  We basically have the euro and a numbe r of fixed-rate currencies, whic h are not worth s howing, so the number of alternatives in the population is smaller. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You ought to  try the zloty or something. MR. KOS.  It may be too calm.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There are indications that inventories are building up on the docks in China and that warehouses  are beginning to fill, which I pr esume is related to the recent weakness in commodity pric es, especially for steel.  Prices fo r cold rolled sheet, which is the premier steel—especially in China—for car making, have come  down quite significantly.  And that’s a classic inventory play.  Are you picking up anything that suggests th at there’s more to this than just temporary gluts?  The data are, of course, nonexistent, but what does one hear about the inventory situation in China? MR. KOS.  We tend to talk to traders rather than to shippe rs and factory managers, so I would not hold myself  out as the expert in this  area.  Certainly among trading and investment types, I would say that there’s a lot of confusion.  The sentim ent about China has been  pretty volatile in terms of whether the eco nomy is overheating or not, what the inventory situation is, and what the policy stance is.  Some of the vol atility that we’re seeing  in markets may be re flective of the fact 10 of 112 that people change their minds about those issues from day to day.  Now, in terms of inventories, I don’t know if Karen has a better handle—   

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  We don’t have any actual real-time data on inventories at that level. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  There is an old classic adage th at suggests that, when everybody says “nobody has any inventories,” it is  telling you that the rate of accumulation is horrendous and that the level is al ready very high by historical st andards but you haven’t sated the demand for the still higher level that occurs just be fore it turns around.  And the first sign is a break in price.  What has happened to the copper price in the last three or fo ur days, by the way? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Copper  prices are down. MR. KOS.  They’re down a bit. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In the last three or four days? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Well, they’re off their peak.  When we put the Greenbook to bed, they had come down from their peak level, and they have come down anothe r 10 cents, I would say, since then.  That was largely on news of the macro monetary policy coming  out of China ra ther than on news about real economic activity or inventories or  anything else.  So, it  was in some sense an inference—in effect, that if Chin a’s boom cooled, copper would become less vi able—on the part of those who trade in futures markets rather than a direct read on wh at was going on.  Now, over the same interval—since we put the Gree nbook to bed through Friday, which is the la st date for which I have quotes—lumber prices, for exam ple, both spot and in the futu res market, went up not down.  That’s partly because what is driv ing the lumber speculators or purchasers or hedgers or whoever is U.S. homebuilding as opposed to Chinese construction.  And thes e market players thought they were getting different signals, so  the futures curve shif ted the other way.  Soybean prices, which are being driven by expectations of the beginning of harvesting, also  have gone up a bit since the 11 of 112 Greenbook rather than dow n.  But cotton is down a lot off its peak; copper is down noticeably from its peak; and wheat is down from its peak.  So a more  informed and discriminating shifting seems to be going on, but it is tied to what  people perceive to be news a bout the factors that are driving demand in th ese markets. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Industrial activity or  more broadly a goodly part of the GDP is better measured by metals pr ices than by lumber , whose demand is fairly concentrated, or certainly by agricu ltural products.  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Right.  And for metals, I think the story isn’t necessarily the same for all of them.  But copper in particular was though t to be driven by developments in China. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Aluminum is peaking,  as is zinc and I think tin.  Somebody still buys tin, but that’s  down, too, I believe. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I have a less de tailed picture in front of me regarding aluminum.  It appears to have stopped rising  as opposed to falling.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It has flattened out. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Yes, but copper ha s already started moving down. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  Any other ques tions for Dino?  If not, would someone like to move the ratification of the domestic market  transactions? 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So moved. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection they  are approved.  Dino, would you like to talk about the swap lines? MR. KOS.  It’s May, which means it is time to consider the renewal of the swap lines.  I did send a brief memo around  which covered the renewa l of the swaps, and I’m recommending that the Committee renew them.  There were also a couple of other items that I me ntioned briefly regarding 12 of 112 some things that we’re doing with the euro reserves.  I’d be happy to answer questions about either item.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If there are no objec tions, I will assume that your request is granted.  We now move on to the staff report, and I call on Dave Stockton and Karen Johnson. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  After countless meetings and much effort to assemble the Greenbook over the past few weeks, I must admit that it was disappointing to come to work last Thursday  to find that our forecast had a half-life shorter than a jar of mayonna ise in the Mojave Desert.  [Laughter]  As you know, the BEA reported that their advan ce estimate of the growth in real GDP in the first quarter was 4.2 percent at an annual rate —a full percentage point less than the forecast that we had published only the day be fore.  We spent the last few days poring over the details of that release in order to assess its implications for understanding where the economy has been and where it might be going.  That task was made somewhat simpler by the fact that so much of our error was concentrated in inventory investment.  Indeed, our projected increase in final sales for the first quarter of 4¼ percent at an annual rate  was only slightly above the BEA’s estimate of a 4 percent increase, with small differences  spread out over several categories of spending.  And after incorporating yesterda y’s data on construction outlays, the BEA would likely raise its estimate of the growth of  final sales close to our April forecast.    The inventory discrepancy, however, was more consequential.  We had been anticipating nonfarm inventory investment to  contribute 1 percen tage point to the growth of real GDP in the first quarter , while the BEA is now estimating that contribution to be just ¼ pe rcentage point.  About two- thirds of our miss was in accounting for truck inventories, which might  seem surprising given that we have reasonably good data on the number of vehicles  held in inventory.  Unfortunately, the BEA does not use a straightforward transla tion of those data to estimate inventory investment for trucks.  And it appears that our attempts to mimic the more complicated BEA procedures led us far off track last quarter.  I hope that you will take it as a sign of mercy and not disrespect if I spare you from the details.  But in the final analysis, we saw nothing in last week’s data that would lead us to alter our forecast of truck production for the year as a whole.  Hence, we believe that, to a first approximation, what was lost in real GDP in  the first quarter from truck inventories will be made up later in the year, starting in  the current quarter.  Owing in part to a smaller estimated drag from the motor vehicle sector, we have boosted our projected increase in real GDP in the second quarte r to 5 percent from the 4½ percent figure that we published in the Greenbook.  Our mi ss, however, was not confined to motor vehicle inventories.  Other inventory investment also ca me in below our expectation, and here we do see the data as having some information content.  The BEA’s translation of the book value figures shows a continued liquidation of real non-auto inventories rather than the stabilization that we had anticipated.  In  response to this apparent continued reluctance by firms to re stock, we are inclined to stretch out the 13 of 112 rebound in inventory investment that we had been projecting to occur over the remainder of this year and into 2005.  That adjustment knocks a tenth off GDP growth this year and adds a tenth to growth next year relative to last Thursday’s Greenbook.    At this point, you are probably beginning to wonder where the mercy is that I had promised earlier, so I’ll leave the trees and return to the forest.  And I must say, the forest is looking pretty good.  Much as we expected, accommodative monetary policy and a third consecutive year of  substantial fiscal stimulus  are combining to provide a sizable boost to growth.  Impor tantly, the labor market is  beginning to show broader signs of life.  Private payro lls rose 160,000 per month, on aver age, in the first quarter, up from the 60,000 per month pace of the f ourth quarter.  Hiring intentions as reported by Manpower and in the NFIB survey  of small businesses also have been moving up in recent months.  Even households ’ assessments of current labor market conditions have improved some of late.  That said, we still believe that it is premature to conclude that the employment situa tion is firmly on the path of steady improvement.  The events of last autumn  come to mind.  As you may recall, the close to 120,000 per month, with noticeable upward revisions to preceding months.  The long-awaited jobs recovery looked to be under way.  But by the December report, those large gains had been revised down s ubstantially, and the initial estimate for  The gains in wage and salary income asso ciated with the recent pickup in hiring have combined with the stimulative effect  of last year’s ta x cuts to provide a substantial lift to household buying power.  And households have not been shy about using that buying power.  Despite a drop in sales of new motor vehicles, total consumer spending rose 4 percent in the firs t quarter; and with car  sales projected to move up a bit, we expect real PCE to clim b at a pace of about 5 percent in the second quarter.  Housing activity has remained ex ceptionally robust, with both sales and construction of new homes at  or near record highs.  Business spending, too, has continued to increase sharply.  Real ou tlays for equipment and software rose 12 percent in the first quar ter, and with order backlogs for capital equipment continuing to rise, the outlook remains quite favorable.   The economy finally appears to be firing on al l cylinders.  Low real  interest rates, tax cuts, and large increases in governme nt spending are fueling aggregate demand, and final sales are advancing briskly.  Add to  that mix what appear to us to be very lean inventories, and there is considerable tinder for an even ho tter economy than we are projecting—a possibility that we explor ed in an alternative simulation in the Greenbook.  Nevertheless, I don’t think that you should discount the downside risks surrounding the outlook just yet.  As I noted  earlier, the improvement in the labor could be a sign that business caution, while  fading, has not yet evaporated.  Even extracting the signal from the strengthening of final sales over the past year is not 14 of 112 straightforward.  Fiscal polic y could be proving a more pot ent source of stimulus to the economy than we have allowed for in our forecast, and thus as this stimulus shifts to restraint next year, the downdraft in demand could be more pronounced than we currently expect.  Needless to say, we believ e that we have balanced the risks in our forecast for real activity, but the unc ertainties remain substantial.    Perhaps the biggest challenge to our fo recast over the intermeeting period came not from the real-side data but rather from the inflati on figures.  With only a few exceptions, the readings that we received  on hourly labor compensation and prices were to the high side of our projection.  As usual, we can trot out a list of special factors that contributed to so me of the fluctuations that have occurred over the past six months.  Used cars, apparel, and lodgi ng away from home are among the culprits in the recent pickup in inflation.  But the breadth of the surprises that we have experienced thus far this year suggest ed to us that recent wage and price developments could not prudently be ascribed to special factors alone.  Confronted with last year’s sharp declin e in price inflation, we had to make an assessment at the turn of the year as to how much of that deceleration reflected a signal about underlying inflation and how much  was just noise.  We view the recent data as suggesting that we at tached too much weight to la st year’s slowdown and that the underlying inflation rate has been above our earlier estimate.  As a consequence, we increased our projection of core consum er prices by between ¼ and ½ percentage point, on average, this year and next.  I s hould note that, in response to this upward revision to inflation, we al so raised our funds rate path by a similar amount.   Although we raised the level of projected inflation in this forecast, we did not fundamentally change its trajector y.  So after a bulge in the fi rst half of this year, core PCE price inflation is projected to move  sideways at a 1¼ percent annual pace over the remainder of the projection period.  That flat path for inflation reflects influences that are individually small and generally offse tting in our forecast.  Over the next year and a half, some upward pressure on costs re sults from a diminishing margin of slack in resource utilization and an end to the acceleration of structural productivity.  But the indirect effects of the expected retreat in energy prices and a flattening out of core non-oil import prices after th is year’s commodity-induced su rge are expected to take some pressure off core inflation in 2005.    Obviously, there is plenty of scope to take issue with the assumptions conditioning our inflation proj ection.  Slack could be taken up more rapidly than we expect, especially if labor force participat ion fails to rebound as anticipated.  Energy prices have disappointed bot h the futures markets and us over the past year by moving up, rather than down.  Strong global demand and continuing geopolitical uncertainties could keep pr ices in these markets highe r and for longer than is incorporated in our forecast.  And if the dollar were to resume a sharper descent, prices of imported goods and services would rise more quickly than projected, and domestic producers would have still greater  latitude to lift their prices.   15 of 112 There are other risks to our inflation ou tlook as well.  For example, despite the upward revision that we have made, our forecas t still reads some signal in last year’s disinflation.  If all of  the price deceleration last year was noise, then our projection of core consumer prices remains between ¼ and ½ percentage point too low going forward.  A more troubling possibility is th at we have fundamentally misestimated the amount of resource slack in the econom y.  The most prominent error made by inflation forecasters in the late 1960s a nd 1970s was a persistent over-optimism about the NAIRU.  That over-optimism had two c onsequences, both of which were adverse for inflation.  First, the economy was allo wed to overshoot potential, resulting in a demand-driven increase in price inflati on.  And second, a failure to recognize and lean against that demand-driven accelerati on in prices resulted in higher inflation becoming more firmly embedded in expectations.    There is some evidence to support these concerns.  A number of you have reported hearing stories from employers that finding workers with the right skills is difficult; if those types of mismatches are widespread, then the NAIRU may indeed be higher than we currently  estimate.  The evidence on inflation expectations is mixed.  But depending on one’s preferred m easure, those expectations have been stable to somewhat higher in recent months.  We explored the consequences of a higher NAIRU in an alternative simulation in  the Greenbook.  In that simulation, core PCE inflation increases to around 2 percent in 2005 and would continue to increase beyond the forecast horizon without an adjust ment to policy.  While a higher NAIRU is as a possibility, we don =t believe that it fits all of the facts comfortably.  Importantly, measures of hourly labor compensation have been running at or slightly below our models, on average, over the past  two years—models that incorporate a 5 percent NAIRU.  And while there has b een some improvement, the labor market still looks more lackluster than hot.    I don’t want to leave you with  the impression that we see the risks to inflation as skewed to the upside.  After a year of very subdued readings  on core inflation, the last three months of larger increase may ultim ately prove to be the outliers, and our upward revision to the inflati on forecast this round may turn out to have been an overreaction.  Moreover, models  that incorporate a role for the level of the price gains in productivity over the past few y ears have allowed firms to rebuild profit price inflation remains roughly stable.  Mode ls that assign a bigge r role to the price and lower price inflation, and thus a more ra pid return of labor’s share of income to its historical norm.  A scenario along these lines in the Greenbook pushed core PCE inflation down to ½ percent in 2005.    In sum, I know that as the nation’s chief worriers you don’t need the staff to explain to you that the b acklog of unresolved worries remains high.  As always, economic, financial, and geopolitical uncer tainties abound.  But in surveying the 16 of 112 economic landscape, one cannot help but be struck with how conventional, familiar, and balanced the risks and uncertainties look today in comparison with those that we faced just a year ago.  Karen wi ll continue our presentation.   

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  One element of the extern al forecast that may be of greater interest than usual is the recent and pros pective behavior of import prices, and I thought that I would begin by looking at some  of the factors driving changes in those prices.  The advance release last week repor ted that the deflator for total imports of goods and services rose at an annual rate of 10 percent in the first quarter, after increasing only a bit more than 2½ percen t over the four quarters of 2003.  A large part of this upsurge reflects the upward move  in oil prices over the quarter, with the prices recorded for computer and semi conductor imports providing some offset by prices also reflects continued increases in the prices for service imports, which rose quite strongly in 2003 as the dollar depreciated.  For the remaining import items, which we term core imports, the annual rate of price increase in the first quarter was 6.6 percent, a bit less than we had estimate d in the Greenbook but substantially more than the 1.8 percent recorded last year.    Among the components of core goods, the commodity-intensive categories of foods and non-oil industrial suppl ies recorded the greatest jumps, with the latter rising at an annual rate of nearly 24 percent.  Th is development is consistent with our model analysis, which suggests that the two most important factors behind the rapid inflation in core import prices last quarter were the exchange rate and commodities, including natural gas.    Looking ahead, our forecast calls for deceler ation of core impo rt prices to an annual rate of about 3½ percent over the remainder of this year and to about ½ percent next year.  This slowing importa ntly reflects the recent and projected path for the nominal exchange value of the dollar,  which paused starting around the turn of the year following a two-year period of de preciation, has risen s lightly on balance so far this year, and is projected to decline only marginally over the forecast period.  The lagged effects of previous dollar depreciation were still evident in core import prices in the first quarter, but our projection for the dollar implies that the contribution of the exchange rate will be a small negative to ze ro starting with the current quarter.    We expect that commodity prices will continue to exert significant upward pressure on import prices over the rest of 2004, largely because of lagged effects from previous increases, but then will hold down import price inflation in 2005, owing to commodity prices rose nearly 50 percent in the first quarter, and our model finds that the effects persist for four quarters.  Pri ces in all four cate gories of commodities—food, beverages, agricultural raw materials,  and minerals and metals—rose in double digits in the first quarter, but some have peaked and begun to decline.  Among the individual commodity prices that rose most rapidly are those for copper, which have already come off their recent peaks.  Si milarly, prices for soybeans have stopped 17 of 112 rising; futures prices call for spot soybean prices to fall sharply at midyear as new crops are harvested.  Thus although our forecas t incorporates a rather abrupt change in the course of nonfuel primary product pri ces, we believe that the signs of that reversal are already evident.  Accordingly, we believe that our forecast for significant slowing in import prices is bala nced, with risk on both sides.  The extremely rapid increases in commodity  prices during the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year , particularly for minerals and metals, are linked to the rebound of real output growth in some regions, especially emerging Asia.  Within Asia, the pace of growth in China, which has averaged nearly 15 percent over the past three quarters, is seen as a major reason for the strong demand for commodities.  Chinese authoritie s have taken steps to tighten monetary conditions and to slow the rate of growth of  bank credit in order to counter concerns about domestic inflation pressures and excessi ve investment in some sectors.  Our forecast sees these efforts as successful , with growth slowing to a moderate 7½ percent rate but not collapsi ng as some fear.  At the same time, we see inflation in China lessening as the rapid increases in food prices abate.  Elsewhere in emerging Asia, we expect expansion to continue at a vigorous pace, depending importantly on continued global spending on high-tech goods.  Bolstered by rapid growth in Asia and continuing strength in the U.S. economy, we look for global output to grow at near its current pace over the remainder of this year and to decelerate only slightly next  year.  Some parts of the global economy, such as Canada and the United Kingdom,  should continue to show firmness in domestic demand.  In Japan, we look for domestic demand, particularly private investment, to be a source of demand stim ulus, but net exports will be an important element in maintaining real GDP growth at around 2½ percent through next year.   The outlook for the euro area is more tr oubled.  We expect that exports will respond to the improved global economy and grow moderately.  But given the past appreciation of the exchange  value of the euro, imports should rise as well.  On balance, we anticipate that th e external sector will be a neutral factor and that real GDP in the euro area will expand at about  the same 2 percent pace as domestic demand.  Such an outcome will not allow for much progress in addressing the macroeconomic problems, such as high unemployment rates and excessive budget deficits, confronting many of the large euro-a rea countries.  It should result in a small tick down in euro-area inflation, permitting th e ECB to delay any rate increase until 2005.    Overall, our forecast for real output grow th abroad is favorable.  When combined with our projection for slight depreciation in the real exchan ge value of the dollar, it yields a rebound in our forecast for growth of  total exports of real goods and services to more than 10 percent over the remainder of  this year and only slightly lower next year.  Both core goods and services sh ould respond to foreign GDP and relative prices and bounce back from rather weak fi rst-quarter figures to moderate growth on average over the forecast pe riod.  In nominal terms, expor t growth should about equal 18 of 112 or exceed that of imports, notwithstandi ng the strong performance of the U.S. economy.  Nevertheless, the trade deficit is expected to widen further this year and next, reflecting the extent to which imports  already exceed exports.  Accordingly, the current account deficit is expected to m ove above $600 billion in 2005.  Dave and I will be happy to answer any of your questions.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for our colleagues?  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  I just wanted to ask Karen a question about China.  You mentioned that China’s growth had be en 15 percent and you ex pected it to slow to 7½ percent but not collapse, as you put it.  There has been a lot of  speculation about the risks and potential difficulties associ ated with a slowin g Chinese economy.  I was wo ndering if you could talk about that a bit in this context:  We all are familiar  with the Asian financial crisis of the late ’90s, and I was wondering what magnitudes we would have  to see in China in or der to come close to what we saw in the late ’90s  and what kind of spillover e ffects would stem from that.   

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Well, if China’s gr owth fell below, say, 5 per cent, I think we ’d see fairly significant spillover effects.   Seven percent used to be a sort of “target” rate of growth; then it became 8 percent and then  it was around 10 percent.  But Ch ina growing at 7 percent would be a return to what we had seen for quite a few year s in the 1990s, which wo uld probably allow for a better allocation of resources than growth of 15 percent is likely to be generating.   The fact that China is not in fact a fully market-based economy  is, I think, the bad news and the good news.  The bad news part is that it probably is  leading to a misallocation of resources and, therefore, to the risk of some over-accumulatio n of certain items—and the sudden redirecting of effort because somebody may well wake up eventually  and realize that the ware houses are full of air conditioners, say, th at aren’t moving. 19 of 112 On the other hand, it’s partly  good news because there ar e no phenomena like CEO risk aversion or tendencies on the pa rt of markets to over shoot or the need for depreciation or balance sheet corrections to work their way through before companies make de cisions.  If the authorities in China decide that too many resources are being used to produce air conditioners and what they really want are snow blowers, the desired realloca tion of resources will happen pretty quickly.  So, to my mind, the risk  in China is more that resources are being wasted.  And given that standards of living in China and much of the world aren’t as high as we’d like them to be, that’s a very significant and important cost.  Bu t I don’t think that in volves the same system ic cyclical behavior yet that a truly market economy would have.   That said, if the Chines e run into economic problems in terms of their abil ity to meet the demands of the population for rising  standards of living and jobs—or  if they fail to deal in an orderly way with the transition fr om a mostly rural to a more industrialized economy—I don’t know what the effects would be.  If th ose efforts hit a rough spot, I don’t know that I ha ve any special expertise to suggest what  might politically happen in China or how that situation would resolve itself.  I do think the spill over to the rest of Asia would be very severe—at least as ba d as in the late 1990s. MR. KOS.  May I just add a comment?  One difference to note between Asia ’98 and China now is that a major issue in the earlier situation wa s an outflow of capital,  but China has a closed capital account.  So a ca pital outflow is something that we’re just not going to see to the same degree in the current case .  That’s one difference that may mitigate th e possibility of a sudden financial crisis similar to what occurred in Asia in the late ’90s.   

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  And in places su ch as Korea and a few other countries, we’re not seeing the current account deficits and the need to attract capital;  so if the capital were to stop flowing, it 20 of 112 wouldn’t have exactly the same consequences.  On the other hand, outside of China, domestic demand is not really  the driving force in Asia ; it is export demand.  So in a macroeco nomic sense, the Asian countries are vulnerab le to development in China and in the United States.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions fo r David or Karen?  If not, who would like to start our Committee disc ussion?  Pres ident Moskow? 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  The pickup in the Seventh District economy has become more broad-based.  Mo reover, our contacts seem much le ss nervous than they were in momentum will continue.  Household spending ha s been robust for some  time, and now we are hearing widespread reports of increases in business spending.  With regard to  the latter, demand is strong for machine tools and for h eavy equipment such as agricultural and construction machinery.  Reports from all of our shipping contacts have been strong, from trucking to warehousing to cardboard boxes.  As for air travel, both United an d Boeing emphasized that traffic is finally above production schedules last week and told us privately that they hoped to be able to raise plans even further.  A publishing executive told us that advertising is picking up, so the magazine business may finally be emerging from what he  described as a “pageless” recovery.  [Laughter]  Increases in demand are showing through to labor  markets.  Both of the nationa l temporary-help firms we speak with have seen stronger growth in billable hours in recent w eeks.  Permanent placements and forward-looking orders have increased, and these firms also are starting to get big orders from large companies. 21 of 112 We’ve heard a lot of comm ents about rising prices .  First, more firms appear to be passing on input cost increases to their cu stomers.  Airlines have now succe ssfully added fuel surcharges to their ticket prices, something they were unable to do a month or tw o ago.  Tool an d dye makers and heavy equipment manufacturers are adding surcharg es to cover higher steel costs, and these price increases are sticking.  Second, we’re hearing that  strong demand and low inventories are boosting pricing power even outsid e of steel.  For example,  one fiberboard container manufacturer told us that the industry’s inventories are at the lowest level since at least 1994, allowing him to raise prices some 8 percent fro m a year earlier.  Third,  in retailing, one contact indicated that  his foreign suppliers were no lo nger willing to abso rb the impact of the lower do llar and have be gun to raise prices.  In many cases, however, retailers have been able to offset those cost increases by raising their own prices.  In  the auto industry, a striking feature is the high level of inventories.  Not all manufacturers are uncomfortable with these levels, in  part because some of the inventories will help cover planned production shutdowns.  The industry’s forecasts for light  vehicle sales for the year are running at or just below 17 million, simila r to the Greenboo k projection.   Turning to the national outlook, the data on real economic acti vity since our last meeting have been encouraging.  Household spending an d business spending have been robust, and firms appear to have gained enough conf idence in the sustaina bility of the e xpansion to  begin hiring in earnest.  So, although we ’d like to see another month or two of strong numbers before declaring victory, we think we’ve turned the corner on employment growth .  Looking ahead,  spending and production seem to be evolving pretty much as anticipated, even with the lower-than-expected numbers for first-quarter GDP.  So we’re still looking for 2004 growth to be well above potential.   The latest readings on inflatio n were surprising.  We continue to believe that there’s a sizable output gap and that some temporary factors are primarily responsible for the recent numbers, 22 of 112 but we can’t dismiss the po ssibility that the output ga p is smaller than  we’ve been thinking.  We all know how difficult it is to quantify  precisely the size of the outpu t gap.  The Gree nbook indicated that the underlying inflation rate is somewhat high er than forecast at our last meeting.  We agree with that assessment, and we believe that the risk s on inflation have definite ly moved at least into balance.  We all will be looking at the data in coming w eeks to see if inflation is much more of a concern than we now believe.  De pending on the data, we may wa nt to move quickly and more aggressively in tightening than the path laid out in the Greenbook, where we start to raise rates in the fourth quarter  of this year.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I want to de part a little from my usual practice here and go directly to the national ec onomy and the overall fore cast.  Frankly, recent developments in our District don’ t deviate much from what appears to be happening at the national level, so I don’t think I would add a whole lot of valu e this morning by go ing through specifics about the regional picture. With respect to the national economy, I don’t recall ma ny times over the years—and certainly not recently—when the inco ming statistical data over an intermeeting period have changed my view of the near-term outlook and the balance of risks quite as markedly as in this most recent period.  The flow of data that David reviewed, from the release of  the March jobs report through the first-quarter GDP report, finally provides some fairly compelling evidence  that the economy may now be moving toward a balanced growth path and reasonably fu ll employment.  The growth in aggregate demand seems to be broadly based, an d productivity growth has now slowed to a point where further increases in demand will stimul ate additional job growth .  Moreover, the core 23 of 112 inflation data over the last few mo nths suggest that the disinflation risk that has worried me and a lot of other people around the table r ecently may now be behind us.   At the same time, along the li nes of some of the cautionary remarks you made, David, the employment gap an d the output gap ar e still sizable.  Unit labor costs are still  behaving reasonably well, so I’m not  yet alarmed about inflation pr essures, especially since I think our credib ility for low inflation is still high.  So it looks like a balanc ed and, at this point at le ast, still noninflationary expansion may finally be taking root.  But as we al l know, in this policy busi ness when we begin to get comfortable that things look good, that’s when we ha ve to be careful.  So  I thought I would use my remaining time—buildin g on some of the commen ts that have already been made—to talk about how recent developments in the fo reign sector, especially  in China, could crea te some risk for the U.S. economy going forwar d.  I should mention that my commen ts will reflect co nversations I’ve had with Marvin Goodfriend, who just returned from an IMF mission to the Pe oples Bank of China.  We’ve had some very interesting discussions, and I’d  like to share some of our thoughts with you.  It appears that the recent firm ing in core U.S. inflation re flects importantly the end of deflation in durable goods prices. When one disagg regates the data—and some  of our staff members have done that—this reversal in turn appears to be related at leas t in part to the strong global demand for manufactured goods, es pecially in China.  China’s overall trade balance has apparently now moved into deficit.  Clearly,  China’s boom is outstripping its  capacity to produce manufactured goods, and the effects of that ar e now spilling over to the econo mies of its tr ading partners, including to some extent this one, I think.  We see effects,  for example, on textile producers—especially of industrial fabrics— in the Carolinas.  I’m  talking not only about business going to China but business coming from China to their companies.   24 of 112 The problem, of course, is th at by all accounts the boom in Ch ina is unsustainable.  Money and credit has been growi ng at an annual rate of around 20 perc ent for a couple of  years.  That’s about twice as fast as productivity growth there, as I understand it, so it’s not surprising that the deflation of a couple of years ago in China is now giving way to inflation, which I think is currently about 3 percent.  I’m comforted by Karen’s sugges tion that inflation in China may now begin to back down; but looking back to their last boom, whic h I guess was in the mid-1990s, inflation reached about 20 percent in that period.  The Chinese eco nomy now is a lot larger than it was then and therefore has significantly gr eater potential to affect the U.S.  economy.  Moreover, investment is a much larger part of  Chinese GDP than it is in  the United States.  And in vestment, of course, is the most cyclically active GDP component. Unfortunately, as  I think we all know, Chin a still does not have instit utions in place that can easily deal with this situ ation and, in particular, that can easily meet the monetary policy challenges they are already facing.  They do n’t have a strong independent cen tral bank.  They  don’t have a healthy commercial banking system.  They don’t have fully flexible in terest rates.  They don’t have a floating exchange rate.  The authorities basically have had to use controls to  deal with these kinds of issues in the past, and they haven’t worked very well.  With th e economy now much  larger and at least in the process of tr ansitioning to a market economy, those c ontrols may be even less effective.  So, while we may be getting some slowing in inflation in China at  this point, the boom could continue for some time and ultimately create a very high rate of inflation th ere.  On the other hand, the authorities could interv ene more rapidly and aggre ssively than they have in  some past cycles and precipitate an early recession.  We just don’t know ye t.  But it seems to me that the upside risk in the situation is probably the greater risk. 25 of 112 Bottom line, against th is background it seems to me that the Committee should make a special effort to determine as  best we can the degree to which instability in the Chinese macroeconomy could affect  the U.S. economy and po tentially U.S. monetary policy going forward.  I’m sure Karen and her staff are already working on this.  But if the potential effect  is found to be large either currently or  not too far down the road, I think the Committee may well want to include in its review of global developm ents an assessment of stabilizati on policy in China— at least from time to time, and if the situation looks serious enou gh, perhaps on a regular basi s.  I won’t be around to hear it, but I think it would be a good idea for the Committee to do that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.   Thank you.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Than k you, Mr. Chairman. The contacts th at I usually call have a generally upbeat view on the state of the economy.  My FedEx contact emph asized particularly that his company is reviewing its capital expenditure plans. Th e fiscal year for FedEx begins on June 1, and they are expecting capital expenditure s in fiscal ’05 over ’0 4 to be up about 20 to  25 percent, and all of that growth is for capacity expa nsion.  He also emphasized the im portance of the fuel situation.  FedEx is concerned not only  about fuel prices but fu el availability.  They’ve been looking closely at whether they need to put in place some storage for jet fuel  particularly, but so far they don’t see any significant availability issues.  The firm’s cont acts with its cust omers suggest that the latter have a positive outlook and that inventories are going to be  rebuilt.  Many even expe ct some scrambling to meet demand given the lean inventory situation. My UPS contact gave me some data on air cargo from the Air Transport Association.  Domestic air freight in the twelve months ending February 2004 was up 9.2 percen t, and air freight for the first two months of this year over the first two months of last year was up 6 percent.  26 of 112 International business was up 10 percent February over February, and the expectation is that the States is growing at an exceptiona l pace—up 60 percent in the first quarter of this year over the first quarter of last year.  UPS is not planning to add to its capital expenditure plan at this point.   The main point that I ge t from my contact at J.B. Hunt is that there’s a lot of upward pressure on prices for truck shipments.  Hunt ha s been able to increase truck shipping rates for thirteen straight quarters; those ra tes are up 18 percent in the last three years and 6 percent over the last four quarters.  Driver supply is extremely tig ht, even tighter than in the period prior to the recession, and the rates for drivers are going up.  At the beginning of this year, drivers’ rates were increased from 30 cents to 32 cents per mile. My Wal-Mart contact emphasized that the March–April sales data are always difficult to interpret because the date on whic h Easter falls varies from year to year.  But cutting through that ambiguity, sales appear to be on a growth track of  about 5 percent.  He continues to believe that those at the lower end of the in come distribution are stressed fina ncially, as underscored by the paycheck cycles and ot her information the comp any looks at, but he th inks those with higher incomes are doing quite well.  Wal-Mart has been  growing about 8 percent per year in square footage, and its new stores have been doing very well. I want to make just a brief comment rega rding the national econ omy and the inflation outlook.  I asked one of my  staff members to make a different kind of calcu lation than we  normally do based on the PCE data.  Usually the core inflation measure excl udes changes in energy and food prices, but I wanted to look at the ex-energy part  because energy has been  the dynamic component in terms of what has been  going on recently. What I asked my staff member to  do was to take total PCE and substitute long-ter m energy futures—crude oil futures prices—for current energy prices 27 of 112 and run that calculation.  It seem ed to me that PCE ex energy—o r more precisely ex the energy curve—might be a useful way to look at the inflati on data.  That calculation results in an inflation rate that is about ¾ percentage point higher at an a nnual rate, averaged over the last four quarters.  So I think inflatio n was not really as lo w last year as we th ought it was because, by concentrating on the core inflation measure and taking energy out al l together, we were not picking up the fact that long-term energy futures ha d gone up quite a bit. In my view, the inflation risks are skewed to the upside at this point.  I interpret the staff forecast, which I think is  fine as a point esti mate, as a median or mode of the probability distribution.  And it seem s to me that the probabilit y of, say, a ½ percentage point inflation miss on the upside is higher than the pr obability of a comparable miss on the downside; I’d say the same for a 1 percentage point inflation miss .  I note that money growth is rising again after falling in the second half of last year.  A couple of people, including the st aff, have made comments about inflation and the gap along the li nes that the gap may not be as large or the natural rate of unemployment as low as we might ha ve thought.  A way pe rhaps of estimating th e natural rate is to look at what happens to inflation.  But that’s not  really helpful in terms of trying to understand where the inflation rate is going be cause the essence of this problem is  to try to pred ict the inflation rate.  The gap may be input to th at, but it’s not going to be construc tive to turn this equation the other way around.  That’s no t going to help us to under stand inflation.  So I ju st wanted to offer that comment.  It does seem to me that the inflation risk s are rising.  Certainly there is a lot of commentary in the market place to that effect.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  Mr. Chairman, at breakfast this morning, I was challenged to try to describe the current economy in a haiku.  By coincidenc e, that’s the way th e briefing for this 28 of 112 meeting started out in Dallas a fe w days ago.  And the haiku is, “The story today is about returning growth and rising prices.”  And I do think that fits pretty much both the Di strict economy and the national economy.  Since Texas une mployment turned the corner la st September, job growth has been moderate and steady.   There has been a notable improvement along th e border, helped along by recovery in Mexican maquiladoras, and border em ployment rates are back down to pre-recession levels.  Retail sales grow th for the border area ha s fully recovered as well. High energy prices may be a negative to the co untry as a whole, but they remain a plus for Texas—a smaller plus than they once were, to be sure, but a plus nevertheless.  As the Chairman discussed in a recent speech, natura l gas prices have been elevated and are expected to remain so for an extended period.  In response, we’ve seen  a gradual expansion of drillin g activity in the District over the past two years.  The petrochemical indust ry, which has seen hard times for quite a while because of high energy input prices and weak dema nd, is getting some relief now; that industry is benefiting from st rong demand from  China and southern As ia, leaving the District  in a pretty strong position for a change. The high-tech sector has been a notable laggard but, after over three years of uninterrupted month-to-month job losses, in March we saw a return of net employment gains in high-tech manufacturing.  The brighter jobs  picture reflects rising orders and production.  Contacts in the semiconductor industry expect top-line sales to gr ow 19 percent this year, bringing sales back to pre-recession levels.  Ga ins are spread across consumer sect ors, communications, and computer sales.  Equipment manufactu rers are experiencing sales growth, too, and see signs that the corporate upgrade cycle is shifting into higher gear. On the inflation front, cost pressures are now evident across the board, and more and more producers are passing on higher costs to their consumers.  Competition fr om overseas has slackened 29 of 112 because of the lower dollar and rising demand in China.  Buildi ng materials, fabricated metals, petrochemicals, and oil field equipment have all seen price increases at  the consumer end.  Increased orders for packaging from retailers have driven paper prices higher.  Steel and galvanized metal are in short supply, and ra ilroads are operating at or near  capacity.  There’s a major road project in Dallas that was a year ahead of schedule, but it has been held up now for several months because of the inability to get a ce rtain kind of steel.  Among the handful of in dustries that have not enjoyed increased pricing pow er are airlines and home builders.  In the labor market, we s till have a large pool of unskilled workers seeking employme nt, and there’s very littl e upward pressure on wages.  However, rapid health care cost increases have discouraged firms from hiring new permanent full-time employees. On the national economy , the latest CPI, PCE, and GDP st atistics suggest that the price pressures that Eleventh District contacts had been reporting earlie r this year have become fairly widespread.  I’m hopeful that the uptick in inflatio n is a one-time adjustment that marks the end of disinflation rather than the begi nning of any significant upward threat.  Nevertheless, I think we need to be wary because the recent inflation rise cannot easily be dismissed as being due to special factors.  Core and median inflation measures are higher, too.  And we need to be wary because estimates of capacity utiliza tion and the output gap ar e subject to large after-the-fact revisions.  The same is true of our measures of profit margins.  Wh ile recent data suggest a strong inverse relationship between profit margins and inflation pr essures, the markup of prices over unit labor costs has little or no pr edictive power fo r inflation in real time. And finally, we need  to be wary because of the very large amount of policy accommodation currently in place.   Significantly, the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey shows a big swing toward easier C&I le nding standards and terms over the past two 30 of 112 quarters.  The net percentage of banks report ing increased C&I loan demand is strongly positive and rising, too.  The balance of risks ha s clearly shifted, and in my view it’s time we cleared the decks by removing la nguage from our press release th at might delay action should action become appropriate.

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  Things continue to  improve in New England.  In particular, comments from manufacturers were more upbeat than we’ve seen in a long time.  Though business confidence in Massachusetts is sl ightly off previous highs, recent surveys indicate particularly positive assessments of national business conditions.  Consumer confidence is well above its level a year  ago—a bit bouncy but well above.  Retail contacts re port improving sales, and residential real estate markets remain strong. You may have noticed that I ha ve not added the caveat about job growth that has become standard in discussions of the re covery in New England.  Labor markets have in fact improved— not wildly, to be sure, but they are beginning to look up.  This marks a real change even from our last meeting.  Data for the regi on indicate that nonf arm employment rose in March, only the fifth monthly increase in the la st three years.  The increase was small and th e year-over-year trend remains negative, but anecdotes suggest that it’s no t a fluke.  Similarly, the unemployment rate for the region moved down slightly an d now is below 5 percent.  Beige Book contac ts are more likely to say that they’re hiring, particularly in manu facturing and related services.  One of the Bank’s tenants, a large intellectual proper ty law firm, reported a jump in patent work in the biotech and computer services areas as well as an increase in  legal work related to pa tent litigation.   They’ve taken more space in our building an d are adding to staff.   Small businesses report increasing activity even in firms associated with co mmercial real estate.  And after the extremely cold winter, contacts 31 of 112 in tourism and hospitality report expanding busines s and some new hiring.  Thus, economic activity clearly seems to be on the uptick. Prices are on the uptick as we ll.  Almost all Beig e Book contacts reported concerns about rising costs for metals, wood, plastic, rubber, fuel and other petroleum produ cts as well as rising health care and other insurance costs.  Concerns  about pricing power remain, but some firms do seem to believe that cost increa ses can be passed on.  Planned sa lary increases are moderate, at 3 percent or so, and capital spending is increasing but also at a moderate pace. One thing I found really surpri sing—and I read through all the notes from our calls with individual contacts—was the nu mber of times that the upco ming presidentia l election was mentioned as a concern regarding the economic future.  A lot of pe ople out there seem to believe that the economy is being pumped up to be primed for Octobe r but then will slide after the election.  I’m sure that’s not the in tent of any of us, but I think it probab ly does reflect some concerns related to the sustainabilit y of the recovery. In that regard the national data received since our last meeting have been particularly encouraging.  While one month’s report on employment is not a complete panacea to the labor insurance claims are movi ng sideways, and hours worked still have  a way to go, bu t all the surveys that Dave talked about in his presentation suggest that firms expect to pick up their hiring rates.  Combine this with rising personal income and expenditures, rising retail sales, a strong housing least over the near to medium term .  Business strength is evident as well.  Strong profit growth and reasonably accommodative financia l markets have led to rising ca pital goods orders and double-digit growth in investment spending.  Despite the increasi ng value of the dollar,  trade seems to have 32 of 112 been only a small drag on economic activity in the fi rst quarter, reflecting stronger growth in many countries around the world.   Does all of this good news an swer the question about how sust ainable the recovery will be, especially after the dose of fiscal stimulus during the first half of this year wears off?  In that regard, our forecast in Boston is a bit less optimistic than the Greenbook’s for the seco nd half of ’04, but the basic trajectory of the data—solid growth, stronger labor markets, a slowly declinin g output gap, and flattening price increa ses—is the same.  Our be t as well as the Greenbo ok’s is that the economy will generate enough steam on its own to realize, after what has ha ppened over the past three years, a very favorable trend. So if we think the recovery is sustainable, the next question is what the stance of policy should be.  I realize that there ar e a couple of ways to lo ok at this question.  Looking at employment and inflation trends against what  might be accomplished in this  high-performan ce economy, the Greenbook, Boston, an d other analysts see an output gap that lasts into 2005.  Th at suggests that caution is warranted before moving rates up, thou gh I agree with a lot of  the comments around the table that we have to be  really humble about  our ability to know either the size of the current output gap or how fast it might close, given the strength th at we see going into the rest of this year.   There is another gap as well, the gap between a funds rate at 1 percent and even our lowest guess of a neutral funds rate.  I think that gap is so mething like 150 basis points .  Again, it’s hard to know how to measure “n eutral,” and we have to be humble about our ability to do that.  But even with a great deal of humi lity we know we’re pretty  far away from neutral now.  Market risk-taking in an environment of very accom modative policy, combined with what likely is a bottoming out—or probably a turning up at least in the near term—of the path for inflation, seems to me to argue that we ought to start cl osing the interest rate ga p fairly soon.  We might need an additional couple 33 of 112 of data points to be sure the recovery is sustai nable, and we surely need to take a look at the language in our press statement this  time around.  But my view is that we ought to be thinking about moving sooner rather  than later.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  Continuing a pattern that was already evident at the time of our last meeting, ec onomic developments in our Southe ast region are upbeat.  There’s evidence from several fr onts that I would point to that demonstrates the growing breadth of our regional expansion.  Florida is the strongest stat e in our area by most me asures, and a substantial share of that strength is coming  from tourism.  Occupancy rates are continuing to rise, and a growing number of foreign touris ts are coming to the United St ates.  Convention bookings in Atlanta are now up 20 per cent over last year, and bu siness travel reportedly has increased further.  Our manufacturing sector is e xperiencing a pickup as well, an d that is reflected in new orders and production.  More goods are being move d and that’s showing up in increased demand for trucking, rail, and air shipments.  Some of this  improvement in manufact uring can be traced to stronger export activity.  And while nonresidential cons truction has yet to show any measurable pickup in most of our markets, activity in the important residential construction sector continues to be vigorous.  Certainly there are sectors that still ha ve more repair work to do.  In our area, those include a major airline and telecomm unications firms.  In some cases , the slow recovery is now not so much a matter of economic climat e but rather the need for new business mode ls.  Of course, we have some firms and some communities highly depend ent on industries like apparel and textiles that are still hurting from the structural adjust ments taking place in  their businesses. Another positive development sin ce our last meeting is that our bankers are now reporting significant improvement in C&I lending, mirroring reports that Al Broaddus, Mark Olson, and 34 of 112 others made last time.  Perhaps an e-mail I received from Ms. Paula Lovell, th e recent past chairman of our board of directors, capture s the kind of upbeat reports that  have now become prevalent.  Paula runs her own public relations  firm in Nashville, and she wrote me a note last week, which she described as “unsolicited” because, her having served ten years on our board, her views on the business outlook had indeed been solicited.  At any rate, she said, “Jack,  hope you and the Fed crowd are doing well.  I know this is unsolicited,  but the flood gates have  opened here with our business.  I had at least twenty companies call during th e first quarter of 2004 to  hire us or to call an urgent meeting to ‘get started.’  Everywhere I look there’s money flowing.  I think things are really strong.” Like others, we’re continuing to get anecdotal reports of rising prices and comments that more of the increases in commodity import prices are being passed through to inte rmediate and final goods.  Examples include steel, energy, food, chemicals, plastic,  metal, wood building materials, fertilizers, tires, ice cream, and ag ricultural products like soy, co ffee, and meats.  While not an Atlanta regional tidbit, the cab driver who brought me from the airport to the hotel here in Washington last night proudly anno unced that, effective yesterday, there was a 10 percent increase in fares for cabs coming into the District.  And he was compla ining because his colleagues in a couple of other cities had gotten 15 to 20 percent increases for similar tr ips.  The reasons being given for the now more widespread price increase s vary but include low inventories, lack of capacity, increased demand, higher  OPEC prices, and regulation. On the national front, I think we  have to be pleased with th e way things are unfolding.  While the initial GDP numb ers for the first quarter were a bit be low many estimates,  they continued a pattern of three quarte rs of strong growth that is arguab ly above long-term trends.  And I’m comfortable with consensus forecasts that have robust growth continui ng through this year and next.  35 of 112 Perhaps most encourag ing is the better balance we’re seeing ac ross sectors, with business spending now making a nice contribution to growth and expected to  continue to do so.  While there is still considerable uncertainty as to the future path of employment growth, the most recent data and anecdotal reports are encouraging there as well.   It’s my sense that we’re now at a point where we need to  spend more time trying to understand price pressures and price prospects and th eir implications for policy.  While we certainly do not yet have any alarming run-up in inflation, I do not think we  should dismiss the signals we makes me uncomfortable, mostly be cause the gap is not a directly observable measure and because, as others have already discusse d this morning, forecast estimate s of the current gap are very different depending on whether one accepts the Board staff’s judgmental estimate, the FRB/US model estimate, CBO’s estima te, or some other estimate.  I’m also  less comfortable than some about inflation expectations being well an chored.  I think recent data an d surveys can be interpreted as saying that we have already had some deterioration. I believe we’re at a point where we can begin to take back so me of the extraordinary policy accommodation that’s in place with out great risk of serious uninten ded consequences.  We can talk about this more in the policy go-around, but if we  believe that a further unwanted fall in inflation is no longer a significant risk—a view that several ha ve publicly expressed recently—and that risk was the reason we gave for our last 25 basis points of easing, then a credible  case can be made at this meeting or at least at the ne xt one for removing that accommodatio n as a first step.  I also hope that we will talk caref ully about any new language we introd uce into the statement as we come closer to the time when we can contemplate a policy shift.  In our earlier discussions I think many of us expressed uneasiness about ma king pre-commitments as to the timing or the path of policy 36 of 112 changes.  Those kinds of commitme nts could eventually mislead markets or tie our own hands.  It’s nice to have come to a point where we can have these kind s of discussions.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. SANTOMERO.  Than k you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Third District continues to increase, although there’s still little evidence of jo b growth.  In addition, the Philadelphia staff’s leading indexes of economic activity continue to si gnal a pickup in growth in all three of our states over the next three quarters.  Retail sales in our region  were up in March and April.  So me store executives reported that the size of the average purchase  had increased and also that sa les of luxury items had risen.  Retailers that generally described inventories as appropriate given the current sales pace have revised up slightly their forecasts for expected sales this spring.  Auto dealers in our region reported rising sales in March compared with February, but the levels have not matched those of a year ago.  They expect sales to remain at ab out the current pace for the rest of the year, acknowledging that it will be difficult to achieve the high le vels of the past several years.   Residential construction activity remains high, although it has ease d in recent months.  Permits in the tri-state area were flat in the first quarter, an d the value of residential construction contracts was down modestly, but sales remained ro bust.  Our contact at one large firm—a luxury homebuilder that is headquartered in our region but has operations throughout the United States— described sales as spectacular, better than at any ti me in thirty-five years.  He has a twelve-month backlog and is raising prices on an ad hoc basis from one area to the next at a rate of about 1 to 3 percent per week.  On the ot her hand, commercial construction remains hampered by high vacancy rates in our office market.  According to a recent study, the center city Philadelphia area is 37 of 112 currently oversupplied by 4.5 perc ent of current stock or approxim ately 1.7 million  square feet, which is equivalent to about two large office towers.  Nonetheless, constr uction has started on the first new tower in the center city since 1991.  While 65 percent of that building is already leased, about 50 percent is leased to fi rms that would be vacating other center city buildings to take advantage of generous tax incentiv es offered on th e new space.   Manufacturing activity in the region continue s to expand.  Our bus iness outlook survey (BOS) index of general activity increa sed to 32.5 percent in  April, up from 24.2  percent in March.  The index has been in positive territory for the last elev en months.  The mo re forward-looking indexes on new orders and shipments improved in Ap ril and are at levels we haven’t seen since the early 1990s.  There was also a noticeable increase in the invent ory index in April, as it moved to its highest reading in sixteen mo nths.  The employment index fro m our manufacturing survey improved again in April and has been in positive territory for seven months.  More companies in our region indicate that they intend  to increase hiring, and help-wanted ad s are up.  Still, the BLS data show that manufacturing employment  in our three states continued to  decline in the first quarter and total payroll employment was flat.  In fact, job growth in our region has been essentially flat since the second quarter of last year.   We’ve been receiving reports fro m some of our directors abou t the difficulty of finding skilled labor.  We continued to explore the labor suppl y issue in a special question in our April BOS.  As I reported last time, our  March survey showed that, of the three-quarters of responding firms that had openings, tw o-thirds of them had diff iculty filling positions mainly b ecause of a lack of qualified applicants.  Our Apr il survey indicated that  a majority of firms are having trouble finding applicants skilled in the use of produc tion machines or  with special pl ant and systems operations skills.  More dist urbing is the fact  that a large number—40 perc ent to be exact—also said 38 of 112 that applicants lacked the basic “three Rs” of re ading, writing, and arithmetic.  For the most part, this cannot be attri buted to foreign applicants with poor English skills, as only 14  percent of the respondents cited the language issue as a problem.  Over half of  our firms reported that the gap between required skills and available skills had widened in the last five years.   Most of the current weakness in our labor market is likely cyclical.  Firms have been extracting as much as they can from current employees, wh ich is typical at this point in the expansion.  Still, our survey results suggest that at least some of the weakness may be structural in nature.  Th e implication is that it might take longer for di splaced workers to beco me re-employed, which means that we may be overstating the degree of slack in the labor market.  These themes, as you can tell, are being repeated around the table. Although employment has remained  subdued, wages in the Phil adelphia region appear to be increasing at a slightly fa ster rate than in the nati on.  The same is true for goods prices.  Industrial price pressures have increased in recent months, and there is some evidence that firms are beginning to pass on some of the higher costs to their customers, another theme that  came up around this table.   The prices-received index in our su rvey is at nearly a nine-year high.  A distributor of office furniture in our District reports that manufacturers are passing on some of the increases in steel prices to their customers.  Our survey index of future prices paid, which reflects manufacturers’ expectations of prices th ey will have to pay for inputs in six months, has increased over the past year.  I don’t want to make too much of this or overstate the case.  By the same token, we’re hearing a lot of this type of news around the table today as well as in our District.  It bears watching, to be sure.  Having said all that, during April I typically  travel around the District, holding a series of meetings with bankers and business leaders; most  report seeing signs of improvement, and they are quite optimistic. 39 of 112 Turning to the nation, in my  view economic conditions ha ve improved since our last meeting, and I believe the recovery may have reached  the point of being sel f-sustaining.  Activity continues to expand at a good pace, even though first-quarte r GDP came in a bit lower than expected.  Note thou gh, as has already been me ntioned, that the weaker-than-expected inventory growth is to a large extent  responsible for that shor tfall.  Consumer spending continues to expand at a moderate pace, and consumer balance sheets remain healthy. House-price appreciation has been strong, and it appears to have been fueled not only by low interest rates but also by a mo re sustainable upward shift in the demand for housin g.  Moreover, roughly 80 percent of outstanding  mortgages are at fixed rates, and most ARMs are hybrids with some rate protection.  But other types of consumer lending tend to  be at more-variable rates than mortgages, suggesting that househ olds may be fully extended and some what more vulnerable to rate increases.  This potentially ne gative effect will be muted so long as labor market conditions continue to improve. When we last met I said that  the missing piece was employme nt growth but that, given the pace of GDP growth, I expected to see employment begin to pick up modestly.  The most recent information on the labor market was welcome news.  The latest evidence sh ows that the recovery continues to move more toward a structural balanc e, which puts it on a more sustainable footing.  I see the risks to econ omic growth as being balanced.  At the same time, we’re getting an inkling of renewed but still mo dest pricing power on the part of many busi nesses, with various measures of inflation firming. Given the current state of the economy and the outlook, I believe  we are getting close to the time when we will need to  adjust policy, bearing in  mind that we’re not considering when to start a tightening regime but rather when to start easin g up on the stimulus.  Recent speeches by the 40 of 112 Chairman and other members of the FOMC have begun to set the stage, as others have indicated.  I think we should take advantage of  this.  Today’s goal should be to  increase our fl exibility regarding future actions so that we can begin taking back  some accommodation when ever conditions warrant without surprising the market .  If we determine that we  need to change rates s ooner rather than later, I do not want us to feel constr ained by our polic y statements.   To this end, I think we should acknowledge that there ha s been some impr ovement in the labor market.  I think we need to change our risk  assessment regarding infla tion.  At least to my mind, the risk of an increase in infl ation is at least as large as a risk  of a decrease in inflation.  It’s also time to remove our statemen t about “patience.”  We added th at when we needed an unusual procedure for unusual times.  Keeping it in the st atement now or replacing it with something else that constitutes an in tertemporal commitment would reduce our flexib ility going forward.  And frankly, I don’t think we know the speed at which we will have to respond.  That will depend on the information we receive on  economic conditions and on our assessment of th e outlook.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, the Tenth Dist rict economy has continued to improve significantly since our last meet ing, with most sector s showing considerably  greater strength.  Manufacturing activity accelerated in March and April.   Production and new orders increased sharply, causing backlogs at a su bstantial number of the firms we surveyed.  Employment rose more modestly, according to our monthl y survey, but it has now been above year-ago levels for three months in a row.  Optimism about  future activity also improved, boosting capital spending plans but leaving hiring plan s little changed.  41 of 112 The year-over-year produc tion index edged up to 31 in March and jumped to 46 in April in our region.  The year-over-year ne w orders index fell back to 29 in March and then rebounded strongly to 54 in April.  In other positive news, in Wichita aircraft manufacturers reported that demand for business jets is finally  picking up because of improved  corporate profits  and an aging fleet among some of the corporat e companies that use these jets.  Consumer spending and housing activity have strengthened since our last meeting.  Much of the improvement in retail sales has been in the mid-level department stores, which had be en lagging behind the big discounters and luxury stores.  Similarly, we have seen  an increase in demand for high -end goods and se cond homes in several parts of our region.  In our tourist sector, advanced bookings at summer resorts have been very strong, although  there is some uneasiness about the impa ct of higher gas prices on tourism as we move through the summer.  En ergy activity has continued to expa nd in response to the high prices for oil but particularly for gas, and there ar e shortages of workers, rigs, and materials in that industry.  Commercial real estate  does remain in the doldrums; that’s the one exception to the generally positive news.  Labor markets are show ing some signs of impr ovement; year-over-year job growth in the District turned positive in March fo r the first time since 2001. On the inflation front, wage increases remain minimal, but surging raw materi als prices have led manufacturers to raise their output prices.  Some  firms said that strong demand has enabled them to increase prices across a broad base.  I’d also mention a point I found in teresting:  Firms began their price increases by putting surcharges on steel , for example, or anything else they could, but they are now moving such increases into their base prices.  So they have had success in passing on those increased costs and now are trying to institutionalize them into  their base price programs.  Bullish commodity mark ets, of course, are helping our agricu ltural sector across the board, and there’s a lot of optimism in  that sector as well. 42 of 112 Turning to the national outlook, the economy is expanding at a solid pace; others have highlighted the evidence supporting that.  Certainly we co uld see GDP growth this year of between 4½ and 5 percent.  I think there are strong indications that growth in th at range is a possibility.  With that said, I’d like to talk  a bit about developm ents on the pricing front.  I think we are beginning to see higher prices and expectations of further increases in prices.  Expected inflatio n is now rising among consumers and much of the business community in our region .  For example, core inflation measures have risen in the last few months, and re cent increases reflect higher  prices for more than a few components.  More troubling, though, are si gns that inflation expectations are increasing.  There was a one-page article in our local newspaper just th is past weekend advising people on ways to prepare for the oncoming infla tionary surge.  While longer-ter m inflation expectations may not have changed on net since last fall, I think they  are higher than they were during the first three quarters of 2003.  I’m not as inclined to say, as suggested in the Bluebook, that long-term inflation expectations appear to be well anchored. Looking forward, while I do not expect a significant outbreak in inflation in the near term, I think the upside risk to  inflation is increasing noticeably.  My concern stems from the currently highly accommodative monetary polic y in the context of a stronger real economy.  The current real funds rate is negative.  The Blue book shows that, for th e first time since late  2001, it is below the staff’s range of estimated equilibrium real rates.  My concern also stems fr om the past depreciation of the dollar and higher levels of energy, commodity, and variou s input prices—with steel being only one of them.  While I recognize that the direct effect of commodity-price increases and the depreciating dollar on cons umer price inflation is generally smal l, these factors may be influencing the psychology of pricing and infl ation expectations.  And I don’t think that should be minimized.  We are receiving an increasing nu mber of reports that efforts to pass price increases up the chain—43 of 112 as I mentioned in my anecdote ear lier—are meeting with success, wh ich may signal further inflation pressures for the future.  For these reasons, I expect core inflat ion to be higher than the Greenbook suggests. I would add, too—and I know we have another discussion ahead of us—that I think we should be very careful about how we describe the outlook in terms of future  monetary policy actions we might need to take.  With that, I’ll stop for now.  Than k you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  I’m pleased to no te that I can summarize my comments by saying that I agree with Al Br oaddus.  And I’m sorry that I won’t have the opportunity to say that again at th ese meetings, Al.  I agree with him with regard to both the national economy and the brittleness of  the China situation.  I think the likelihood of  the Chinese authorities succeeding in slowing down their boom in a smooth wa y is less than 50-50.  We’re going to need to monitor that situation.  Many of  us, myself included, have been saying that the timing of policy tightening will depend importantly on the evolution of the output ga p, especially as  reflected in labor markets, and of infl ation prospects.  I will re view where I think we are with re gard to each of these and my sens e of the implications for policy. On the output gap, ac cumulated information on labor markets, especially the March employment report, has made it more likely that the strengthening we all expected is finally coming to pass and that slack is being taken up.  In effect, the data have reduced one downside risk—namely, that productivity would remain so strong  that even the forecasted robust demand would be insufficient to absorb the substa ntial margin of exces s labor and other resources.  Productivity growth does look as if it has slowed in the fourth and first quarters to an av erage of mere ly 3 percent 44 of 112 from the 4 to 5 percent range of the previous coupl e of years.  But I thin k we still n eed to be somewhat cautious in ex trapolating these data. On payrolls, let me make  just a couple of rema rks.  We basically have one month of data in which growth has been more  than marginally above the number needed just to tread water in labor but not by much.  Capacity u tilization in manufacturing rose.  The unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage point on a quarterly average basis, but part of th at decline was ac counted for by another fall in participation rates, and the unem ployment rate itself in March was above its first-quarter average.  With actual growth  exceeding estimated po tential by a few tenths at an annual rate, the staff’s output gap measure fe ll only 0.2 percentage point in  the quarter, to 2 percent. The staff has potential growth this year and next  at around 3½ percent,  in which case we’ll need to see demand growth  well north of 4 percent to make any real progress on absorbing slack.  In fact, growth of around 5 percent is the rate projected in the Greenboo k, at least for the remainder of this year, and strong growth in coming quarte rs seems reasonable to  me.  Growing business confidence and continued household willingness to spend appear more than  sufficient to overcome any drag from higher energy prices, greater geopolitical risks, and a potentially sharp slowdown in China.  Still, we haven’t seen gr owth appreciably above 4 percent in this expansion, except in the third quarter of last y ear, when spending wa s boosted by child credit ch ecks and the cash from the surge in mortgage refinancings.  And productivity still c ould surprise us on th e upside, as it has so often before.  In sum, I agree that the economy appear s finally to be on a path toward full employment, but some of the eviden ce is tentative and preliminary.  The trajectory so far has been very gentle.  And even if we real ize the more robust growth project ed relative to productivity, slack is likely to erode gradually over coming quarters. 45 of 112 On inflation, the incoming data on prices and compensation cert ainly have laid to rest my lingering concerns that inflation would continue to  fall.  The question is whether we are seeing a more persistent strengthening of inflation pressure s, which would be reflected in rising inflation itself if we don’t act quickly and forcefully.  On balance, I don’t thin k so.  I see a nu mber of reasons to believe that inflation will remain low and stable, albeit at  a higher level than I thought a few months ago.   First, some part of the recent uptick in core inflation is plausibly attrib utable to the pass-through of a series of one-off price increases—in effect, adve rse supply shocks in energy, commodity prices, and import pri ces.  Many commodities have come  off the boil of late, as Karen pointed out; petroleum prices have leveled out; and the dollar has strengthened—suggesting that these influences are not like ly to be repeated, at least on their recent scale. Second, slack, continued productivity increases,  and the current elevat ed level of profit uses, core consumer inflation fell between 1.1 and 1.5 percentage po ints from 2001 to 2003.  Even allowing for some u nderstatement of inflation la st year owing to special factors, this degree of Unlike President Poole, I do th ink we can invert the equation and infer wh at the slack was by looking at what happened to inflation.  With resource utili zation currently arou nd or only a little above the levels that prevailed during much of this period, the odds seem high to me that substantial effective excess capital and labor cap acity persists and w ill exert competitive pressures on price increases.  In addition, even with its recent slowdown , productivity growth remains elevated, which will help to contain increases in unit labor costs.  The staff sees tr end unit labor costs about in line 46 of 112 with price increases this year an d next; but even if unit labor cost s, actual or trend, increase significantly more rapidly than an ticipated, inflation need not rise given the elevated level of price levels prevailing today.  In 1998 , 1999, and 2000, unit la bor costs rose substa ntially faster than prices without exerting much upward pressure on rates of inflation. Finally, long-term inflation expectations do ap pear to be stable to  me, judging from the longer-end of the TIPS-derived yield curve as we ll the Michigan and Philade lphia surveys.  Under prevailing circumstance s, I have trouble wr iting down the model th at puts inflation on  a rising trend, but I have to admit I am less certain  of this than I was a few months ago.  Recognizin g that there is much about the inflation process th at we don’t understand, we will need to monitor incoming data on inflation and inflation expectations carefully. As for policy implications, inte rmeeting information has made a 1 percent funds rate less comfortable than it was at the last meeting.  Infl ation is higher—less close to an unacceptably low level and less likely to fall—chang ing the risk-management calculus.  Higher inflatio n and the rise in short-term inflation expectations do imply a lower short-term real  interest rate at a time when demand already seems to be quite strong.  Although long-term real interest rates have risen in a stabilizing response to incoming in formation, that increase is based on market expectations that we will tighten beginning this summer. Given my forecast that we are no t at the early stage of rising inflation even at these funds rate levels, I still believe we should await confirmatio n that the output gap re ally is on a trajectory toward closing before we tighten.  That said, with infl ation higher, risks shifting, and labor markets beginning to firm, we clearly are closer to tightening than we we re before if that confirmation comes in over the next few mont hs.  So I agree with my colle agues that we need the added 47 of 112 flexibility in our stat ement.  But also, given my  expectations that slack will diminish slowly while inflation remains low, the path of tightening consis tent with meeting our objectives is likely to be gradual—more gradual than in many past polic y-firming episodes.  I think it will be im portant that one way or another markets come to  understand this as we prepare to  tighten.  After only one month of strong employment growth, I wo uld be concerned that, if market s build in a rapid and sizable increase in rates, the resultin g substantial tightening of fina ncial conditions could slow the expansion unnecessarily.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  Much of wh at I plan to say is going to sound familiar by now.  I will start by observing that the trends that ha ve been apparent in the Ninth District for some time have accelerated and we ha ve a rapid expansion ongo ing.  Recently we’ve had meetings with our Advisory C ouncil on Small Business and Labo r as well as with leaders of a variety of Twin Cities’ financial services firms and our board of directors, an d almost all of the anecdotes have been distinctly positive.  Let me run through some of those quickly. The manufacturing sector is e xpanding substantially.  Employme nt is growing in that area, exports are up, investment in equipment and softwa re is growing, and firms in general are seeing top-line growth and are quite pleased  with that, needless to say.  La bor is generally available in the District, but hiring has picked up, and there is so me discussion of the skills mismatch issue that Dave Stockton and others alluded to .  Housing remains quite  strong, and a number  of large projects have been started recent ly; so at least on the construction side, people  are still optimistic.  Construction of office space remains weak, but ab sorption has begun to pick up, and if that continues, it will probably lead to some renewed activity in that arena.  Consumer spending has been and continues to be strong.   48 of 112 The really significant change is the one that ot hers have already identified, and that’s on the pricing side.  The anecdotes are almost universally along the lines that companies are finding the ability to raise prices now and that those price incr eases are sticking.  It’s  happening across a wide range of goods and servic es, and I think that has done something positive for business attitudes and confidence.  But it is quite widespread, and I must say it gives me a bit of pause. As far as the national economy is  concerned, I have only two or three comments.  First of all, from my perspective the situ ation and the outlook that we’re c onfronting haven’t changed very much.  I’ve t hought for a long time that the outlook is po sitive, and the recent data have served to confirm that.  As Dave said, the economy does app ear to be firing on virtually all cylinders now.  On the inflation side, I’m not predicting a signific ant acceleration of inflation from here; but based on the data and the anecdo tal information, there’s clearly more  action on that front than I would have expected as recently as two or  three months ago.  Something is  going on.  It may turn out not to persist, but I do think the likelihood of further declines in inflation—or even a leveling off at the recent pace—has probably diminish ed.  And finally, I can’t resist  the temptation to add that I question the value of trying to go from the outp ut gap, however me asured, to resulting inflation.  I just don’t think it is in the data.

MR. MOORE.  Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.  At a recent large family dinner, my daughter made the remark that it was a pleasure to get to sit at the adult tabl e even if it was only one time.  Sitting here today, I can relate to her co mment!  [Laughter]  The Twel fth District’s already solid expansion has gained additional momentum recently.  Amid  signs of increas ed manufacturing activity in general, the resurgence in the IT sector is especially good news fo r our District.  Sales of most technology products are up substantially from  last year, and District IT exports have grown 49 of 112 quickly of late, with much of the increase going to Asia.  According to one California contact, this development can be summarized in a single word—a word that you’ve heard frequently this morning already—China.  Conditions have even st abilized in the strugglin g aircraft sector.  Although Boeing’s production activ ity is well below the company’s 1999 peak, the recent pace of deliveries and existing order ba cklogs suggest that the company will produce about the same number of planes this year as la st year.  Other sectors are showi ng strength as well.  For example, some District markets for new an d used homes saw a flurry of activity recently.  Homeowners in parts of the San Francisco Bay area  faced very weak dema nd for a sustained period following the IT bust, but now they, too, are seeing double- digit price appreciati on and record sales. Households throughout th e District have kept their wallets open more genera lly, with strong consumer spending reflected in growing sales ta x revenues.  The vigor of overall activity has translated into significant job gain s in most of the District, though California’s recent labor market performance has been a disappointment.  The state has taken steps to deal w ith one source of high labor costs by reforming its workers’ compensati on system.  California em ployers face workers’ comp costs that are more than thre e times the average for the rest of the nation.  With the passage of two major bills since last  summer, reform is  well under way.  The second of  these bills, in particular, should lead to some short-term rate relief  and to larger gains over time. Progress has been made on the state budget as well.  California is on  track to issue about $12 billion worth of de ficit finance bonds.  The first issuance, totaling almost $8 billion is scheduled for this week and will co nsist mostly of fixed rate  bonds.  The second issu ance is expected to be $4 billion and is sc heduled for late May or early June.  To attract an additional set of buyers, it will focus on bonds with variable rate s.  Because these bonds are backed by a ¼ cent di version of the state sales tax, major rating agencies recently assign ed grades to the first issuance that are several 50 of 112 levels higher than those currently assigned to the state’s general obligation debt.  More generally, a somewhat improved revenue outlook, combined with an emerging spir it of compromise  reflected in legislative and public attitudes, bodes well for the state’ s ability to eliminate its sizable structural shortfall in future years. Turning quickly to the national economy, our vi ews about the contours of the forecast for economic activity don’t differ in any major way from the Greenbook.  However, we are assuming a steeper trajectory for the funds ra te through the end of next year.  Recent employment data certainly increase the odds that the labo r market is turning the corner , which would solidify the robust expansion in train.  Still,  it’s our view that the evidence on jobs is a bit too tentative to be completely convin cing quite yet. The inflation data are a little wo rrisome.  It’s hard to tell if the data reflect transitory movements following unusua lly low rates last year or a modera tely higher underlying inflation trend.  We take some cons olation in knowing that at least part of the recent increase in inflation is due to one-time effects from oil pr ices and the dollar.  And the fact  that there appears to be some slack left in the eco nomy suggests that contai nment of underlying inflation is the most likely outcome.  That said, uncertainty about skill-matchi ng issues raises some question about the exact amount of slack in the labor ma rket.  Another ongoing concern is that longer-term inflation expectations remain at relatively high levels.  Overall, we’ve ra ised our forecast  for core PCE inflation to 1½ percent for this year and expect it to edge back  down to an underly ing rate of about 1¼ percent for 2005.  We see the risks to this forecast as fair ly evenly balanced .  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The ba lance of risks has changed since our last meeting, and the changes seem largely favor able.  The outlo ok for growth seems stronger, with less downside  risk.  Inflation risks appear mo re balanced around a higher but still quite moderate path. The economy of the Second District has continue d to improve.  The pace of the expansion has increased.  Where we were we aker earlier in the year, we ar e now stronger.  There is less caution in the commentary.  Employ ment is increasing quite rapidly, and businesses report plans to increase hiring further in the months ahead.  We hear, as do others , lots of reports about skills mismatches and difficulty in  filling positions.  Inflation in our region is higher than the national average—about double—despite what seem to be highe r levels of resource sl ack and a later onset of recovery.  Much of the rise  in prices is due to housing, but bu siness contacts in the District report higher input prices an d a greater ability to pa ss on these costs, on goods at least. For the nation, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a rate of roughly 4½ percent this year even if monetary policy follows the path  now reflected in market interest rates.  The fundamentals of an improving labor market, m oderate compensation gr owth, and high reported confidence levels seem likely to support a reasonably strong pace of growth  in consumer spending.  Investment spending seems likely to continue its rapid recent pace,  supported by greater confidence in demand growth, strong profit margins, and favorable financial po sitions.  In contrast to the picture at some points ov er the last few months, it’s hard to find evidence of actual or incipient softness in demand.  Al though we forecast continue d strong productivity growth, we expect the pace to moderate and employment to expand at a rate somewhat above estimates of the underlying rate of growth in the wo rkforce.  Overall, we continue to su pport a balanced risk assessment on growth, with a path only moderately above what we consider to be potential.   52 of 112 The inflation outlook has change d more significantly.  The acceler ation in inflation suggests a more broad-based shift than simp ly the transitory effects of large changes in  a few components of the index.  Surveys of establishments show  a more generalized increase in the abilit y to pass on cost increases.  Unit labor costs seem likely to have sh ifted into positive territory in the first quarter—a significant swing, even if the overall rate of increase seems only modes tly positive.  The TIPS spreads show a significant rise in  inflation expectations over the medium term and a very modest rise—one could even say by some  measures a small decline—ov er the longer term.  These developments do not, in ou r view, portend a significan t risk of sustai ned acceleration in inflation in the near term to levels in consistent with our objective of price st ability.  We still belie ve that the size of profit margins, the de gree of slack remaining in the labor market, the fading  effect of the decline of the dollar, the recent surge in commodity and en ergy prices, and the pres sures of competition will work to contain the degree of accel eration in core consumer prices. Our forecast is for the core PCE to increase roughly 1½ percent in 2004.  We are less confident in that forecast, howe ver, given the uncertainty we fa ce about the path of productivity growth, the size of the output gap, and the relationship be tween output and inflation in this environment of transition.  These developments alter the monetary policy calculation. We need to be more attentive now to the risk that a sustained increase in prices could materialize at an earlier point than had seemed likely, and we  can afford, of course, to be less concerned with the risk of an unwelcome fall in the rate of infla tion.  The risks of being late co mpared with the risks of moving too early are now more symm etric.  We need to adjust our statem ent accordingly, to position us to be ready to act soon if the numbers confirm the recent trend toward stronger employment growth. The financial markets seem  to reflect a high degree of conf idence in our capacity to contain the risks of a significant acceleratio n of inflation.  The stability in long-term expectations that seems 53 of 112 to be reflected in the term structure, however, ca n’t be separated from the substantial degree of monetary policy tightening now priced  in over the next twel ve months.  This is a sign of credibility.  On balance, I think we should welcome the degr ee to which markets have  pulled forward their expectations of the timi ng of the first increase in rates.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO.  Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.  Business conditions cont inued to improve in the Fourth District.  The pace of  improvement appears to  have accelerated in recent weeks, and the improvement is rather broad-based across industri al sectors.  I’d like to make four general observations about business condition s in the Fourth Dist rict.  First, businesses appear to be accelerating their capital spe nding plans for this year and next.  Second, they continue to identify opportunities to increase productivity .  Third, firms remain very disc iplined about their hiring plans. And fourth, the broadly base d run-up in raw materials prices that we’ve been seeing, combined with healthy order books, appears to be affording some companies the opportunity not only to pass along these price increases but also to fi nally get some additiona l pricing leverage.  I want to expand a bit on these four general observations with a little more detailed inform ation from a few companies that I follow closely. One company produces customized rubber parts th at are used in a large number of products in a variety of industries.  Less  than six months ago, the CEO of this company was very concerned about his business.  His order book was spotty, and his customers kept pressuring him for price reductions.  He was worried about losing business to As ian producers.  In fa ct, he was so worried that he finally found an Asian supplier himself rath er than produce only fr om his domestic facility.  54 of 112 Today, his order book is full, he  has a backlog, and he has been able to pass along raw materials price increases and expand his margins a bit on top of that.  The domestic toolmakers that he buys from suddenly have huge backlogs as well.  He is  investing in new and so phisticated manufacturing equipment to continue to improv e his productivity and is cautiously  adding to his workforce.  A second company that I follow stam ps and fabricates sheet metal. The CEO of this company reports that his orders have picked up sharply in the pa st month and that he, too, is buying new capital equipment.  He is going to esta blish an operation in China to supply his U. S. customers who are producing there for the Asian ma rkets—a move that he said is actually strengthening his relationships with customers in do mestic markets as well .  This company also is now able to pass along price increases due to the incr eased cost of steel and is able to  widen its profit  margins in the process.  Finally, in the course of our Beige Book calls, a number of specialty retailers and department store contacts indicated  that they were, for the first time, having some success with scaling back the price discounts that they’ve been giving.   I believe these companies and their stories re present a growing number of firms in my District and they reflect the strengthening in business conditions that is taking  place.  I have little doubt that the business cycle is swinging decisively  into a new phase.  I expect that, as this new phase takes hold, we will see many  more markets, including labor ma rkets, firm up because of the increases in demand.  A natural el ement of this business-cycle proc ess should also include, in due course, a rise in the equilibrium real rate of interest. I see an apparent inconsistency between estimate s of resource slack and stories of reviving pricing power and the higher-than-e xpected inflation report.  Among the people that I talk with in the District and in some of the financial press, stories about th e return of pricing power have replaced stories about the jobless recovery.  I believe that the risks on inflation are balanced.  As 55 of 112 President Moskow noted earlier, infl ation expectations are relatively  stable partly because of our credibility.  So indicating that we will begin to unwind our policy accommodati on will be necessary to anchor inflation expect ations.  And if th e data continue to indicate strong economic performance and inflation that is higher th an expected, I would like us to  have the flexibility to react appropriately.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bernanke. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  At our last meeting, I expressed some wariness about relying too much on anecdotes for a ssessing the economic situation, particularly the inflation situation.  Well, as somebody once said, the plural of anecdotes is data.  The data since the last meeting do suggest that  inflation has stabili zed and that the recovery is beginning to take hold.  I concur, therefore, that this Comm ittee should begin preparing the gr ound for a normalization of the federal funds rate.  Based on current information, ho wever, my sense is that  this normalization can proceed at a deliberate pa ce for three reasons.   First, it’s a mistake to equate the stance of monetary policy with the level of the current federal funds rate, as some seem to do.  In part because of our communic ation strategy, which has linked future rate ch anges to the level of infl ation and resource utilization,  monetary and financial conditions relevant to th e economy have ti ghtened considerably since our last meeting.  For example, since the day be fore the March FOMC mee ting, both the ten-year Treasury rate and the high-grade corporate bond rate have risen about  75 basis points, and the thirty-year fixed rate mortgage has risen about 60 basis points.  Judging  by the small increase in  the TIPS spread, these increases are largely real increase s.  In addition, the dollar has appreciated about 2 percent since 56 of 112 conditions broadly co nstrued have already begun the process of normalizin g, and the impetus being applied to the economy has been correspondi ngly reduced.  Of course, absent major new developments, we need to follow through with the tightening the market now expects, but we should not be overly wo rried about having fallen behind th e curve.  The mo netary tightening process has begun without us, so to speak, and it will cont inue to evolve endogenously with incoming news. A second reason to plan to be deliberate in our tightening is that downside as well as upside risks to the economy do remain, in  my view.  We have seen only on e month of strong job numbers, and although an unwelcome disinfla tion now appears quite unlikely, th e labor market remains in an early stage of recovery, with esse ntially no increase in  the employment-to-population ratio over the past three quarters despite robust out put growth.  With prod uctivity growth still strong, a high rate of output growth as well as a convi ction on the part of employers that rapid growth will be sustained is needed to suppor t new job creation.  From a risk-management perspective, as we begin to raise rates we should weigh the risk of significantly impe ding the labor market re covery against the risk of having to scramble to adjust to unexpectedly adve rse inflation developments. Third, it is true that recent in flation has been above the desira ble level.  I hear what people are saying around the table; absolutely, I hear the c oncerns being expressed.  The question before us is whether the situation involves a on e-time adjustment or whether the pattern will pers ist.  The data notwithstanding, the case for believing that core in flation will remain co mfortably in the 1 to 2 percent range over the next year  still seems strong to me.  The arguments for forecasting stable inflation go well beyond  the level of the output gap, which I recognize is imposs ible to measure with precision.  Besides labor market slack, the arguments for stable infl ation also include the impact of continuing productivity growth on unit labor costs, the un usually high level of price–cost 57 of 112 markups, the intens ity of domestic–int ernational competiti on, the likely decele ration of commodity prices, and the recent endogenous tighteni ng of monetary and financ ial conditions, which I’ve already noted.   Perhaps the principal area of risk on the inflation front is  the possibility that inflation expectations may ratchet upward.  Given our stru ggle to improve communica tions and in honor of Al Broaddus’s last meeting, I ca nnot resist the tempta tion to point out how helpful a quantitative medium-term inflation objective woul d be at this juncture.  [Laugh ter]  Clarifying  our inflation objective would increase the coherenc e of our policymaking.  It woul d also help to anchor private-sector expectations of inflatio n and perhaps reduce the significan t inflation risk premiums now embedded in long-term interest rates.  Most impo rtant, if we provided quantitative guidance about our inflation objective, we would now be able to make a firm, highly visible, and ultimately verifiable commitme nt to maintaining price st ability at this crucial mo ment in the expansion. Finally, returning to reality, [laughter] I en dorse the Bluebook’s proposal to replace “patience” with the phrase “can likely be removed at a measured pace.”  The proposed new phrase implies no commitment whatsoever on our part.  The word “likely” clearly conveys that the new wording is intended to be a probabilistic forecast of the evolution of policy conditional on the currently available information.  No further change in language would be necessary before tightening—or even after the tightening process begi ns.  In particular, with this wording we can certainly raise the funds ra te in June if the incoming data so dictate.  The majo r benefit of this language is that it will calm fears that the Fed is currently planning to rep eat the 1994-95 pattern of pre-emptive strikes.  In  communicating that that  is not our present inte ntion, the new wording will serve the very useful fu nction of reducing the chan ce of an overreaction in the bond market that would damage both the markets and the economy.  Thank you. 58 of 112

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just after our last  meeting, Greg Ip wrote a column describing three a lternative strategies for the Fed to follow in getti ng rates back to normal.  We could be early and gradualist, wait and make su re, or follow what he calle d the late and leisurely strategy in which we wo uld actually aim for a rise in inflation.   Taking them in reverse order, I’m not impressed by the late and leisurely strategy.  I did give a speech six months ago that argued for a target band for the core PC E of 1 to 2½ pe rcent.  While I argued for a band and not a point  target, one could infer that my desired target would be about 1.8 percent—roughly what inflatio n has been over the past decade and slightly abov e what it is forecast to be now.  Fr om that, one might infer that I’d ha ve some sympathy for the late and leisurely strategy, but  I really don’t.  Permi tting inflation to rise some  before we extinguish it reminds me too much of a controll ed burn in the forest  fire business; there are many an ecdotes of controlled burns getting out of contro l.  In a fine-t uning sense, inflation might be forecast to be slightly below where we desire to see it in the long run, but I would be very reluctant to base policy on a controlled rise in infl ation because I don’t think we could control the rise. The second strategy—waiting until we are sure that the expansio n is on track and that there is a risk of higher inflation before changing policy— strikes me as risky as we ll.  In the forecasting game, we will never be that sure of  anything, if for no ot her reason than that the data get revised so much after the fact.  Waiting until we  think we are sure stri kes me as an invitatio n to wait too long.  In the case at hand, output has been growing at he althy rates for nearly a year now.  The expansion seems to be quite balanced and st able, and it is easy to envision outp ut gaps gradually closing.  I’m already pretty sure that there is at  least a risk of higher inflation.  Exactly how much of a risk is not clear.  The Greenbook argues persuasi vely that much of the recent upt ick in inflation is just that—an 59 of 112 uptick.  Even the scenario labeled “higher inflatio n” has inflation bumping up and then stabilizing.  One can worry about pass-through effects, but there is an argume nt that commodity prices are stabilizing, that the dollar has stopped dro pping, and that energy pr ices will decline.   It’s hard to question these arguments on logi cal grounds though one ca n have fears.  First off, the wide uncertainty ranges in the Greenbook chart indicate that the staff is pretty uncertain about all of this.  The commodity-price assumption involves some guesswork about the Chinese economy; the dollar assumption invo lves some guesswork about Asian central bank behavior; and the oil assumption involves  some guesswork about political instab ility in the Near East.  I myself wouldn’t feel hugely confiden t about any of these guesses, though I don’t question the main assumption.  Further, we might dismiss the slight rise in infl ation expectations as reflecting the boding of basically uninformed co nsumers who can’t distinguish price shocks from continuing inflation.  We could question the slight rise in TIPS spreads as attributable to  technical problems in that market. Hence, while none of these indicators is a defin ite sign that inflation is on the rise, all of them together do give me pause.  And I might say that the anecdotes I’ve heard around the table today do as well, and in  some ways these anecdotes may be mo re fine-grained th an some of the formal data we’re getting.  But to be honest, my bi ggest fear reflects a haunting similarity with the ’60s and ’70s, when those in the economics profession were rather firm in insistin g that inflation would not heat up because output gaps were large.  Output gaps turned out to be not as large as we thought, and inflation got pretty  high.  Given all thes e concerns, the wait-an d-make-sure strategy strikes me as another invitation for us to get behind the curve. There are too many uncer tainties to be resolved and too ma ny haunting memories. 60 of 112 Having rejected the first two strategies, it shouldn’t come as a h uge shock that I favor gradualism.  As a theore tical matter, gradualism involves taking smaller steps but st arting earlier.  The disadvantage is that policymakers know a slight bit less when they start the tightening process.  The advantage is that, other things being equal, par ticular rate moves are smaller and less disruptive.  After each small step, we can make assessments  and either proceed or not proceed.  If one wanted a medical analogy, the doctor gradually removes th e stimulants when the patient appears to be reviving, monitoring all the while .  Since this strategy reduces the chances of falling behind the curve, in general I think it should be preferred.  I haven’t been ready to start the tightening process until recently, but now I’m reassess ing.  We know that the inflation process has a lot of momentum.  That does seem to be the one thing we can take fr om all of these experiences.  And to me it makes an enormous difference whether in flation is possibly pointed down,  as I thought last year, or possibly pointed up, as I fear this year. I recognize what Ben just said, but let me focu s on the follow-through pa rt of the issue that he raised, which is how fa r monetary policy is out of equilibriu m.  According to the Bluebook, the forty-year average real funds rate has been 2.7 pe rcent.  Adding 1½ points  for normal inflation and another small bit for the effect of productivity on real ra tes, we are at least 350 basis points away from equilibrium.  That’s a lot of small changes, and those of us who are gradualists had better start thinking about changes fair ly soon.  I recognize that we could do a lot w ith our rhetoric and we could always make larger changes later in the proce ss, but that’s exactly the course I’m arguing that we should try to avoid if at all possible.  I also think it is time to change our rhetoric.  In the gradualist strategy, we can be very patient in carryi ng out our rate increases, but  I hesitate to use that word because I think it ha s become a code for the policy strategy that I don’t favor.  If I could 61 of 112 paraphrase Rogers and Hammerstein, I’d like to change  our rhetoric so that we are in a position in

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yo u get the academy “rewar d.”  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to discuss two data points :  one a survey of bankers and the other an update  on fiscal policy.  I surveyed a large money center bank, a large regional bank, and a smaller Midwestern regional ba nk.  I was surprised to find that they all were less optimistic th an both of our lender survey s and less optimistic  than I had antic ipated based on what I was hearing from other lenders only recently. Starting at the money center ba nk, a point that I probably don’t need to repeat is that asset quality across the board is bulletproof.  Banks ar e in excellent shape, and lo an quality is in excellent shape.  The money center banks are reporting that, while IPO i ssuance and bond issuance are strong, supply may ex ceed demand given that loan demand re mains light.  As a matter of fact, the focus this year has not been on the provision for loan losses, which is backward-looking, but on capital required to support future lending, taking in to consideration loan de mand, credit insurance, credit default swaps, and any other hedges for other parts of their portfolio.  They are scaling back the credit allocations that they had anticipated needing in the future.  Also, in their equity funds they are seeing an outflow in the high-yield funds, indicating what they believe is an emerging pickiness among the investors, which I think reflects to an extent the oversupply. Another comment my contact made was that in  his judgment the aggregate portfolio risk was the lowest he had seen in seve ral months.  He attribut ed that to the fact that there is still not a great deal of confidence in the re surging economy.  As a ma tter of fact, he said that, if we were to measure the difference in the approach to the economy of their economists and their traders, we would find that the economists are more optim istic than the traders— although that gap is 62 of 112 narrowing, as has been the case fo r some time.  Bu t it’s a difference that we’ve seen before between people whose views stem from looki ng at the data and those who as sess the outlook based on their feel of the activity in the marketplace. One point to be added is that the banks are not seeing growth in loan activity by the large corporate borrower, for all the reasons we’ve talked about before—the improved cash flow, which can increase the debt  service capability; the internal fi nancing of fixed in vestment; and the restructuring of the balance sheet.  But there’s go ing to be one very large borrower coming to the there is actually significant loan  growth.  A lot of financing in  technology, such as equipment purchases, is done by leases, which may or may not be reflected in bank lending activity, and there’s still a lot of activity in the commercial lending sector.  But, on balance, I wa s quite surprised that the tone I detected among my contacts was no t nearly as optimistic as that in the lenders’ surveys.  Nonetheles s, their comments did reflec t the data that we  saw in the Greenbook, especially the flow of funds data, which were consistent w ith only isolated areas of improved activity. Fiscal policy is not a pretty picture, but it’ s consistent with a pr esidential election year scenario.  We are probably  not going to get any appropriations bills passed other th an for defense. We’re not going to get a budget bi ll passed, and we’re almost cert ainly going to be looking at a lame duck session following th e election this fall.  Th e good news is that, wi th the absence of a new appropriations bill, spending will be limited to th e appropriations levels from the previous bill.  More troubling, however, are the lack of a coherent  Republican strategy in the majority across the House and the Senate and the lack of a coherent  Democratic strategy across the House and the Senate.  So the debate on fiscal policy effectively focuses on whether or not the Congress will produce a transportation bill that, as you all know, is lo aded with pork  and whether or not, if it is 63 of 112 passed, the President will veto  it, a veto that al most certainly will not be su stained.  So the news is not good in either of the areas I’ve examined, partic ularly on the lenders’ si de.  If we’re looking for support for an improving economy, it isn’ t clear when one lo oks at the numbers.

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  Obviously, as  has already been talked about, several pieces of incoming data put the ques tion of rising inflationa ry pressure squarely on the table before us at this meet ing.  We’ve heard anec dotal information from almost everyone who has spoken.  The March CP I number obviously has b een on the table.  Monday’s ISM prices-paid index rose 2 points, to 88, which I think was the hi ghest for that index sinc e 1979.  So there are a number of pieces of information th at give us reason to be actively  discussing upwa rd pressure on inflation at this meeting. Against that backdrop, I think there clearly are two important questions.  On e relates to where we are starting:  Is  the level of inflation th at we’re starting with as low as we originally thought?  The second  is, What is the outlook for inflation?   The first question basically comes down to whether we overestimated the fa lloff in inflation over the last several quarters.  I think the staff here and at the Atlanta Fed—an d many others—would say that a number of transitory factors affected the inflation picture in 2003 and led us to  believe that underlying inflation was lower than it actually was.  That may well be true, but I think the basic contours of the picture really haven’t changed dramatically.  If one looks at the variety of measures of slack in the economy—at what happened to unit labor costs, me asured productivity, unemployment , labor market inflation, et cetera—they all suggest that there was a significant amount of slack  last year in the economy and that underlying inflation did, in fact, come off some.  That is, we didn’t get the picture totally wrong, though we might have overes timated the degree of the falloff in inflation somewhat.  That is 64 of 112 obviously comforting because it does mean that we are starting at a relatively low level of inflation.  We are not close to reaching th e kind of inflation that, under any reasonable view, would be considered inconsistent  with price stability. The second and more important question is whether the pickup in inflation that we’ve seen recently, as we’ve heard in this r oom from anecdotal information and other sources, is such that it would likely require a relatively rapid policy response  starting in the very ne ar future in order to maintain a rate of inflation that ’s consistent with pr ice stability.  Here I would come down, though somewhat uneasily, to the general view that th e Greenbook probably ha s it about right—that inflation has clearly stabilized an d may pick up somewhat but not to  the point that we should fear falling behind the curve. Let me first talk about the easy part of that assessment.  I think the March surp rise in the CPI is likely to be adjusted  somewhat in the forthcom ing data.  All of us are well aware that some of what we saw in March reflected transitory effects on the upside , offsetting some relatively noisy data in components such as appare l and lodging away from  home.  I’m not tryi ng to underplay the outlook for inflation has deteriorated so much th at we need to signal a dramatic change in our views.  I would admit that that is  a tough call.  There are a number of  different models of inflation, but by and large I come down again being generally comfortable with the range of outlooks described in the Greenbook. If one thinks about these various theories of inflation, one must say that some would perhaps lead to some upside concern; the issue of th e pass-through of commodity-price increases could again surprise us on the upside.  It is true that ma rkets expect commodity prices to come off a bit, as 65 of 112 the Chairman and Karen were discussing earlier, but we have been surprised on th at score.  It is also historically true that the commodity-price pass-thr ough has not been an important part of inflation dynamics.  But again, one should be cautious. In my view, more worrisome th an this issue about commodity prices—where by and large I think the standard wisdom is likely to hold—is the question of inflation ex pectations and inflation dynamics.  Some of us are concerned that a consis tent series of upside surp rises on inflation might start to become embedded in inflation behaviors and inflationary expectations. That is something certainly to be aware of.  Ned talked about mistakes that this institution ma de in the ’60s and ’70s.  I think many of those mistakes can be tr aced back to some misunderstandings abou t the dynamics of the economy but al so to a willingness of  the Committee at that  point to buy into special stories to explain almost every upside surprise.  So we should be very careful not to quickly reject this whole negative scenario with re spect to inflation and the inflatio n dynamics that come from upside surprises. While putting some weight on those things, my gene ral view is that the greater probability is that inflation will pick up only rela tively slowly from this point.  I w ould still say that I tend to focus more on the more tr aditional views of what driv es inflation.  I think ther e continues to be a great deal of evidence of some slack in  the U.S. economy, thou gh it may be less than  we thought it was at the previous meeting or the previo us several meetings.  Labor markets clearly have not completely recovered.  It is true that we’v e had one good data report, but we have to be careful in interpreting that; we’ve had a few head fa kes in that regard in the past.  I would say that the rate of hiring still is showing only some early signs of picking up.  The ECI seems re latively well contained, but we probably want to exclude some one-time effects.  Trend unit labor costs al so, it seems to me, most 66 of 112 likely will be increasing at  only a gradual rate.  Finally, I woul d say that the structural productivity story is still in place, wh ile obviously the cy clical components of  that will clearl y wane a bit.   So, at this stage I come down—admittedly so mewhat uneasily—agreeing with the general sense of the Greenboo k that inflation is likely to pick up only gradually going forward.  This suggests to me that, when we get to the second ro und of our discussion toda y, there may be two or three ideas that I would hope we could all agree on.  One is a cl ear recognition that the risks obviously have become  balanced with respect to  inflation and that we’d  lose credibility if we weren’t ready to say that.  But I don’t think that th ey necessarily have moved to the upside.  Second, I think we should continue the process of clearing  impediments to raising rates to more neutral levels.  We have moved from “con siderable period” to “patience. ”  Like Governor Bernanke, I endorse the proposed new language in the Bluebook, and I’d suggest that we continue to move on that path.  And third, I think it is  very important that we  signal as we move fo rward that a moderate pace of moving rates back to neutra l is most likely.  By definition, we’re going to be driven by the incoming data.  But given the range of uncertaintie s we face now, I think it would be a mistake to lock ourselves into any pa rticular path of rates going forward, im plicitly or explicitly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  I will take the opportunity for the la st time, I guess, to say that I agree with President Broaddus.  As I prepared for this meeting, I too found that the changes since our last FOMC meeting were signifi cant.  As I looked at the different indicators I track, I saw more change than I ha d for quite a long time.  I want to  talk about three aspects of the data that I ended up focusing on:  inventories,  employment, and the vari ous inflation indicators. 67 of 112 Let me start with inventory growth.  I think we  all were surprise d about how little inventories grew in the last few months, below even the Greenbook estimates.  If one looks at the historical trend in both inventory–sales and inve ntory–consumption ratios, what is remarkable is that the downward trend of these ra tios that began in th e ’90s has continued— except for a slight flattening in wholesale manufactur ing inventories during the recession .  In fact, even the Greenbook forecast of inventory accumulation this year, based on the recent changes in the GDP numbers, suggests a level of invent ories in 2004 that will be  less than that held by companies in 2000, despite double-digit sales growth in the in tervening four years.  So, what  is happening with companies’ inventory management practices? Recently I had an opportunity to be with some financial officers of several different types of businesses, and one of the things I found was that the anecdotal comm entary was mixed.  Particularly among manufactu ring industries, there is still a lot of caution out there.  Thes e tended to be firms that had suffered a lot in industries where there is real pres sure on profits.  Perhaps like the company President Pianalto talked  about, they’ve been worried ab out building their book of sales and have been trying to get thei r inventories down even further.  On the othe r hand, folks in the retail industry told me stories about  how they continue to be on a pa th of substantially changing the way they integrate information systems across thei r companies, going from the prospect books of their sales forces to order books  and to inventory management.  While a lot has been accomplished in that regard, many of these financial officers felt  there were still significant ways th at they could continue to improve their manageme nt of inventories.  Manufacturing  firms also are doing this, but again they started more on the cautious side th an the retailers, who were talking more about improving their inventory management processes. 68 of 112 In terms of employment, I was glad to see that in March we  had for the first time some growth in payrolls.  I’m still a little pessimistic becaus e it has been so long si nce we’ve seen real job growth.  But it clearly is one of the indicators that  I’m sure we all hope w ill be showing sustained growth going forward.  Payroll income has not moved a lot in the last couple of years, and I personally am concerned that, after the tax refunds have played out this year and we see a slowing in the pace of equity extractions  from housing due to ri sing mortgage rates, we will need  to have significant payroll growth in order to su stain a strong level of final consumption. And finally on the inflation numbers, it was amazing that after our March meeting every indicator of inflation that came out suddenly showed a reversal in the trend th at we saw in 2003.  In 2003, every month—and  even on a twelve-month rollover meas ure—rates of inflation continued to fall.  But that has really chan ged, and the anecdotes that many of you mentioned at previous meetings have come to b ear.  As I looked at the various pieces of the inflation picture, I focused on the question that some of you have  already asked:  Is something fundamental happening, or is this attributable to unusual events?  Clearly, we have  issues with some comm odities where we ’re seeing worldwide demand-driven price change s.  But overall what is amazing is that prices on the goods side generally have stopped their decline—a decl ine that obviously helped  to lower the overall inflation rate for the last couple of years.  And this is true fo r everything from used cars to apparel; it’s not just raw materials or commodities prices.  The other side, th ough, is that the rate of inflation for services—which had been relatively high in the last couple of years—has continued to come down.  If one takes out medical serv ices in particular, it is clear that the rate of inflation for other services is continuing to moderate .  And since services are such a big part of our economy, if that trend continues I believe it w ill help to offset some of  the lack of price declin es on the goods side as we go forward. 69 of 112                                                  2 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). Putting all that together , my position is that I do believe that the inflation risks are finally balanced.  I would also echo the comments that were made earlier about changing our statement in order to allow us as much  flexibility as possible so we can respond to  whatever the da ta show in the next couple of months and can take  the appropriate steps when needed. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  I th ink we have covere d everybody.  Mr. Reinhart. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman .  I will be referr ing to the material that Carol Low distributed to you during the co ffee break.  Market interest rates staged a remarkable runup over the intermeeting pe riod, spurred on by data releases that surprised investors by their strength and by comments of the Chairman during congressional testimony.  As shown in the t op panel of your first exhibit, the funds rate expected to prevail one year ahead advanced 85 basis points.  The red line in the middle left panel indicates that market participants currently believe that you are on a path to raise the funds rate  3 percentage points over the next two years—and that you’ll embark on that journey sometime soon.  Indeed, a full ¼ point tightening is first priced in by the August meeting, a nd as shown by the bars at the right, significant weight is placed on the funds rate  being at least as high as 1¾ percent by suggest that you’ll seek to carve out additional elbow room for future action by dropping or modifying the “patience” language.   The revision over the intermeeting peri od to the outlook for policy prompted a 75 to 90 basis point rise in nominal Treasury yields, which was recorded predominantly in their real components.  Despite some narrowing of corporate risk spreads, an average of real corporate yiel ds (weighted by capital spending and plotted at the bottom left) gained 60 basis points since your March meeting.  Adding in the appreciation of the dollar a nd the small net change in equity prices, it would appear that financial conditions tight ened appreciably over the intermeeting period—a point Governor Bernanke has made.  An important element in your decision today is whether you view this tightening as commensurate with the revision to th e economic outlook.  To help frame those deliberations, three alternatives were presen ted in the Bluebook, which are repeated at the top of exhibit 2.  The wording of alte rnative A was designed to address the worry that market participants may have built in  excessively prompt and aggressive policy tightening and that the associated firmi ng in financial conditions could threaten economic outcomes in 2005.  Alternative B might be favored if you believe that market participants have pegged about correctly your assessment of the odds of policy action over the next few meetings but you also desire to emphasize that policy 70 of 112 firming will be gradual to limit the chance of an overreaction in markets when tightening commences.  In contrast, alternat ive C includes a ¼ point hike in the funds rate, which might seem appr opriate if you interpret th e tightening of financial conditions as the initial signs of buildi ng pressures on inflation or increases in equilibrium real interest rates.   Taking these alternatives in turn, the case for A, which makes only minor changes to the wording of the statement and reta ins the commitment that you’ll be patient, likely rests at least in part on dissatisfac tion with the slow progress in working down resource slack in most forecasts and perhaps, too, on concern about downside risks to such forecasts.  In the staff outlook, as shown in the middle left panel, substantial resources go unused over the next one and three-quarters years, with the output gap lingering at ¾ percentage point  in the final quarter of 2005, while core PCE inflation still runs at just 1¼ percen t.  Although readings on payroll gains and CPI increases might indicate that businesses have become le ss hesitant to hire and that some pricing power has returned, the two histograms deri ved from data since the early 1980s at the middle right serve as a reminder that those monthly readings are very volatile.  A 70 percentile range of the monthly change  in payroll employment spans 300,000; the comparable figure for CPI inflation is 0.3 percentage points at a monthly rate.  Moreover, given the outsized increase in th e core CPI last month and the evidence of some tendency toward reversal, you might think that the risks around the next CPI release are skewed to the downside.    The Committee might be inclined to go slowly if recent developments seem reminiscent of the false economic dawn of  two years ago.  Back in March 2002, as sketched out in the bottom left panel, market participants we re also firmly of the view that tightening was imminent and priced in 1¾ percentage points of funds rate increases over the balance of that year.  Both economic data and the moral fiber of some of the leaders of corporate America subsequently proved shaky, and those expectations unwound, just as (in the bottom right panel) the consensus expectation of the year-end unemployment rate rose.    This time around may really be different.  The discussion of alternative B in your next exhibit begins by noting that members might find the staff forecast both plausible and acceptable in its outlook for durable economic expansion and muted pressures on inflation.  A notable aspect of the economic releas es over the past six weeks was the consistency with which they  surprised on the upside.  But economic forecasts are always uncertain.  Some sens e of that can be gotten from the middle panels, which plot the distributions of three-quarters-ahead Gr eenbook forecast errors for the unemployment rate and four-quarter  CPI inflation, centered around the current forecasts for 2004:Q4.  Those distributi ons—derived from the past twenty-five years—are notably spread out.  Over the last  year or two, we’ve pointed to the lower tail of the distribution at  the right, in conjunction w ith the zero bound to nominal interest rates, as a rationale for mainta ining any unusually ea sy stance of policy.  Now, with the risks of deflation substantia lly diminished, you may wish to shift your focus more to the upper tail of the distribu tion.  The possibility of significant upside 71 of 112 surprises unfolding in shor t order may make you uncomfortable with the commitment that “the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation.”  But “patience” was meant to convey two notions:  that the Committee believed it could wait awhile befo re acting and that, once policy firming commenced, it could be gradual in returning th e real funds rate to its neutral setting.  It is the former, not the la tter, that at the moment may seem to be confining.    In the Bluebook, we offered modified language that the “Committee believed that policy accommodation can likely be removed at a measured pace” to emphasize that you see yourselves entering a tightening phase  but one that likely will not be as aggressive as in prior episodes.  That emphasis seemed important because, as in the table at the bottom left, market participants  currently anticipate about 200 basis points of firming in the next year.  That is proba bly influenced by the experience of the three prior tightening phases, in which the funds rate moved an average of 2 ⅔ percentage points higher within the first year.  But w ith inflation lower now than in those prior episodes, you may see less need  at this juncture for such  firming, perhaps viewing as more likely something on the order of th e 100 basis point increase assumed by the staff.  In the Greenbook, the gradual realizati on by investors that you will not need to tighten as sharply as they now believe imparts an accommodative offset to your policy firming.  Without that offset, you ma y be concerned that the swing of both monetary and fiscal policies toward more restraint may slow the growth of spending next year even more than is built into the Greenbook.     There are potential costs associated with delaying tightening and conveying a sense of gradualism.  The recent increase in  short-run inflation expectations—say, as measured by inflation compensation in the Treasury market as in the bottom right panel—may represent a cautionary flag in that regard.  But inflation compensation between five and ten years from now seems much better anchored, perhaps encouraging you to believe that a statement along the lines of alternative B would not cause market participants to questio n your inflation-figh ting resolve.    If you think that the odds are higher that inaction might prompt building of inflation concerns, you might opt for alternative C, which is discussed in exhibit 4.  In particular, a ¼ point firming might be favored if you are of the view that inflation has more than bottomed—that businesses have re gained a considerable measure of their pricing power and intend to us e it rather than absorb highe r costs by cutting into their fat profit margins.  In that environment,  persistent monetary policy accommodation measures has sent the real federal funds ra te further into negative territory and the brighter outlook for the economy has been associated with an increase in the equilibrium funds rate.  Such concerns woul d be heightened if you suspected that the natural rate of unemployment was higher than  the staff currently assumes.  As an alternative simulation in the Greenbook indi cated, a natural rate of 5¾ percent, instead of less than 5 percent as assu med by the staff, would add more than 72 of 112 ½ percentage point to the inflation forecast for next year (as shown in the middle right panel).    One consideration regarding the timing of such a move is that, as in 1994, it could spark significant financial mark et turbulence.  Indeed, as shown at the bottom left, in both episodes the Committee kept rates low for a protracted period.  This time, however, market participants seem better prep ared, in that the expected path of the federal funds rate (the dashed red line) points decidedly higher than was the case in 1994 (the dashed blue line).  Moreover, th e large upward revisi on to expectations over the course of 1994 should not necessarily  be taken as evidence of the primary role of a self-feeding dynamic in which policy tightening prompted investors to expect more tightening.  Rather, a portion was due to the respons e to incoming data that suggested a more rapid improvement in  the labor market, seen as the downward drift in a consensus forecast of the unemploy ment rate at the end of the year (shown at the bottom right).  That said, you should be prepared for a sharp revision to expectations and heightened volatility should you surprise markets by firming today, especially acting so close in advance to key readings on employment and inflation.  That in itself may be sufficient to diss uade you from such an action before making your intentions more clear.     In the last exhibit, I provide an update d version of the table from the Bluebook that gives the statement wording for the thr ee alternatives that I have discussed.  Of particular note across the columns is the characterization of in flation risks as now balanced—which was driven by recent data —and the promise that policy tightening would be measured under B and C.  Based on feedback I got since the Bluebook was distributed, I offer three changes to the suggested wording, one in the rationale paragraph and two in the risk -assessment portion, with all three highlighted in bold.  First, some members were troubled by the characterization that inflation was well anchored, so that has been softened to “c ontained.”  Second, it seems appropriate to stress that the outlook has changed by noti ng that “the risks to  the goal of price stability have moved into balance.”  Lastly, to be sure that the qualifier “likely” obviously applied only to the pace that you intended to remove policy accommodation rather than when you’d start th e process, I redrafted the last portion of the last sentence to read “policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.”  That c oncludes my prepared remarks.    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Vincent?  Pr esident Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Vin cent, I just had a que stion about the word “measured.”  I guess there are three options here.  We have been using the wo rd “patient,” and that gives a certain me ssage to the financial market s.  So as you’ve outlined in the Bluebo ok, we could retain the word “patient,”  substitute the word “measured” for it, or we co uld take it out completely.  73 of 112 As I read the Bluebook, it said that if we put in  the word “measured,” interest rates would still go up.  If we take out the wo rd “patient” and put nothing in its stead, interest rates would go up further.  I was wondering if you could give us some idea of the magnitude of those differences.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  To what  significant digit? 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Whatever you decide! 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I think we ca n agree on the sig n.  The experience of taking out the promise of remaining ac commodative for a “considerable peri od” and substituting what seemed to be a similar concept of “patience”  was that it prompted a good-siz ed market reaction.  Similarly, “patience” has now become a loaded word, and the fi rst thing traders will do at 2:15 this afternoon is to look to see if that word is in our statement today.  If there is nothing there at all, then I think you should expect a movement up in forward rates on the order of 10 to 15  basis points .  Leaving the sentence there but changing the language and using the term “meas ured” will send them to their dictionaries where they w ill find that the second meaning in most common di ctionaries is “connotes a gradualism.”  In my view , that will prompt a reac tion on the order of, say,  5 to 10 basis points.  I’m looking to Dino to see if  he agrees or disagrees. MR. KOS.  My dictiona ry aligns perfectly with Vincent’s.   

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  But does your ma rket sense align with his? MR. KOS.  Vincent makes a very  good point about the initial reaction in January, when “patience” replaced “considerable period.”  And I think he’s right that market participants will look to see if “patience” is in today’s statement.  If it is not, there will be a knee-jerk reaction pushing yields higher. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you. 74 of 112

[SECTION]

 MR. REINHART.  The other point I’d like to make, President Mo skow, is that in the total scheme of things, any reaction to the wording today is going to be dwarfed in significance relative to what happens at 8:32 Friday morn ing after the employment report comes out. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Right.  But basically you’re talking about a small num ber of basis points from the difference in the wording? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Yes, but  it will also influe nce how market participants subsequently react to the data.  That is, thei r view of the em ployment report or the CPI is going to be filtered through the lens of what they think the Committee is going to be doing.  In that sense “measured” is a speed bump to them as well, in terms of overreacting to the data.  So it’s not ju st a matter of what happens this afternoon; it’s what happ ens over the next six to eight weeks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was going to raise a question  that goes right to the point that Vincent was just making.  The critical issue is not ho w the market will respond this afternoon but how best we can cr eate language that will align our reaction to the data and the responding to the incoming information.  I think he said it goes without saying. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  But I had to say it nevertheless!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  So I think it migh t help to give some sense of that—to modify this language and say something like “with inflation low and resource slack and given the economic outlook”— to emphasize the point that, if the economic outlook  changes as a co nsequence of the incoming data, then of course it makes sense for us to recons ider the pace at which we would remove the accommodation.  I’d put it in thos e terms.  Between now  and our next meeting, we’ll have two employment reports, and I gues s we’ll have two CPI reports.  If  e ach of those sugges ts a revision to 75 of 112 the outlook such that the outlook for activity is one standard devia tion higher and inflation the same way, that would be quite  a major change.  And I think it would require us to react a little less gradually than we might otherwise.  I agree that gradualism makes a lot of sense if the world comes out according to the staff forecast.  But if it do esn’t come out that way, we don’t want to lock ourselves into a market assumptio n that we’re going to be moving gradually, it seems to me. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  I’d like to go to this point of what the market’s reaction will be.  Obviously the market reaction is going to be depe ndent upon what we do relative to what market participants expect us to do.  Th eir expectations are the relevant issue here.  But I don’t know how we measure market reaction when we don’t have  a way of going out there and asking market participants, “What would you think if we said  ‘measured’?”  The mark et is expecting an adjustment, I would argue—an elim ination of the word “patience.”  But I don’t know  how to split that hair and say that, if  we eliminate “patience,” which is what the market expects, but don’t put in a word that is somewhere between  patience and an imminent move—a word such as “measured” whose second definition is “slow movement”—we’re goin g to get a 10 basis point increase in rates.  More to the point, we’re th en going to have to sit around here next time and worry  about whether it is time to be less measured, and that troubles me as well. I thought that the combination of the speeches an d the market’s expectat ions as to the data would allow us the opportunity to do what the market expects by taking out “patience.”  I just wonder whether we’re generating another problem by adding “measured.”  I don’t know what the reaction to that is going to  be.  Whatever the reactio n is, we’re going to have to pay for it later when we no longer want to characterize our prospective policy actions as measured.  I don’t know if that’s 76 of 112 a question! [Laughter]  You answered the question of what  you expect the mark et to do, though I don’t know how one could even begi n to answer that question.  I th ink market partic ipants are going to scramble to their dictionaries and ask, “What do es ‘measured’ mean?”  And then they’ll try to figure out our intentions and how to react. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Haven’t you d one surveys on the market’s expectations regarding the language?  I think you have. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  In the survey by the Desk , the question we aske d market participants was whether they expected us to drop or modify the word “patience.”   

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  If they expect  us to drop it or modify it, I read that as an opportunity to drop it.  If we really wanted  to know more, I guess we  should have asked, bu t I’m not sure how to do that.  There are lots of wo rds in the Eng lish language. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  It’s ha rd to know how to interact with market  participants about potential wording.  Obviously I am  making a guess here , but it does seem, on the basis of reading various newsletters, that the preponderance of ec onomists who write abou t the issue expect the Committee to modify rather than to drop the word  “patience.”  But that is  a guess.  I once asked a Nobel laureate what he thought wa s the best way of finding out how market participants would react to wording in the statement.  He  suggested that we do what those in the survey industry do—have focus groups and really experiment with traders.   My reaction was that the only time I’ve ever thought about experimenting with traders it involved cattle prods!  [Laughter]  It’s just hard to— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Traders react to what they think other traders are going to do who react to the way they think s till other traders are going to react .  To try to anticipate how they will react is a futile activity in my experience.  President Hoenig. 77 of 112

[SECTION]

 MR. HOENIG.  Vincent, this may be more of a statement than a question also.  But in my experience on this Committee we’ve ne ver acted in other th an a measured way.  And I can’t see our doing otherwise as we go forward, depending on th e data we get.  In my  view the only thing we accomplish with this word specifically is to put a collar on our selves and to tell the market that we’re putting a collar on our selves going forward.  I think that’s what we’ve done in the past, with the result that, anytime we want to make a change, we have to wait at least one more meeting to prepare the market for the change—u sing the statement as the vehicle.   That is the point Tony was making earlier.  We have an op portunity here to dr op this language, and I think we should. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  May I ju st interrupt?  I’ll anticipat e what I’m going to say in my comments to you in a few mome nts.  This language enables us to move the next time.  But the wording is very interesting.  The word “measured” is  referring solely to the rate of increase, not to when the increase will begin.  We have no way of knowing  what the data are go ing to show over the next several weeks.  As Vincent pointed out, what ever we decide here an d whatever the response, the reaction is likely to be a small fraction of what the market will do on Friday.  If, for example, we were to go very far and try to move more than the markets exp ect and we end up  with a 50,000 payroll number and 0.1 on the core CPI, we will have moved awkwardly.  I’m  not sure what the reactions would be to that.  But I don’t think this  proposed language restricts us in the slightest.  As you say, Tom, we always move in a measured way.  So the use of the term “measured,” if I take you literally, should have zero effect because th at’s the way we al ways move.  Merely  stipulating that doesn’t change anything. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Partly my  concern is what w ill happen if the payroll numbers come out better than 300,000 ag ain and we have more inflation.  Then what are we  going to do next time? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do you mean what will we say or what will we do? 78 of 112

[SECTION]

 MR. HOENIG.  What are we goi ng to do?  We’ve already told the ma rket if we say “measured” today, what we’r e going to do next time. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  What we will do is that  we will move th e funds rate up. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Okay. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And the first move we make will be a big deal, especially if it’s in June and not in August as everyone expects.  Unless you want to move either today or in the intermeeting period, which I would not recommend— 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I understand what  you’re trying to do in te rms of preparing for the next meeting.  My only concern is that , once we put this language in th ere, when the next meeting comes and we have our policy discussion we’ll have to  worry about the word “m easured”—which I think was President Sant omero’s point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Anythi ng we do, whether it’s 25 basis points or 125 basis points is by definition measured.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  That makes me f eel a whole lot less well.   

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  You had a measured ri se in your temperat ure!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan.   MS. MINEHAN.  We’re beating to death the issue th at I want to raise here, so it’s probably not helpful for me to raise it agai n.  We are debating the term “measured.”  If we take the phrase that includes “measured” out of sentence 8, we’re le ft with a statement that says we think the policy accommodation can be remove d.  That raises the question:  We ll, if that’s what you think, why didn’t you do it?  So we ’d have to take out the whole sentence if we want to get rid of “patience” and “measured” altogether.  But I’ m not sure what the market react ion would be to something like alternative B without sentence 8—without any statement whatsoever that reflects, as we’ve been 79 of 112 doing all along, some sens e of bias in our policy intentions.  As  much as I am in agreement with the view that putting yet another phrase into our quiv er will perhaps raise all kinds of consternation about what we mean by it,  I think we’re left with a hard choice here.  So given that hard choice, I think maybe “measured” has to stay. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  May I ask just one other question?  Do you see a time when we would take this word out? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I thin k you would take this  word out if you e nvision circumstances comparable to the latter part of 1994 where you’d be moving, say, 50 or 75 basis points.  In other words, if it were February 1994  and we were using this framework, we probably would have sent you a Bluebook that said  “policy accommodation can be removed at a measured pace.”  Most likely that would have stayed in the Bluebook until July or August when you felt you were behind the curve and had to do larger increases.   

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  So while we have a series of  25 basis point increases it would stay in? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  In some  circumstances it might be help ful to keep in the “measured” phrase even in the act of tightening so market part icipants don’t extrapolat e that tightening more than you think appropriate. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  I have a question of process.  Do you wa nt to continue th is discussion?  I can hold my comments  and wait, but I want to we igh in on this issue as we ll.  It’s a question of whether we’re going to co me back to it or not. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Oh, of course we can come back to it. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  I’ll hold my comm ents until later then. 80 of 112

[SECTION]

 MR. GRAMLICH.  Mr. Chairman, at  this point I think it would be helpful if you would give your views and your policy recomm endation, and then we could all say what we think about this.  [Laughter]  That may avoid our be ing surprised, just as we don’ t want to be su rprised by the upcoming unemployment report. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay, le t me talk in a measured ma nner.  [Laughter]  First of all, I think there’s no que stion now that this recovery is broad, deep, and evolving into a sustainable expansion.  Indeed, I have the suspicion that a very  unusual factor in this recovery allows us to project it further than is usually the case.  Corpor ate management is very conservative and not prone to anticipate a recovery and, hen ce, to move ahead of it.  Movi ng ahead of the recovery usually means putting in plan t facilities more quic kly, expandi ng the company’s labor force well before the additional workers are needed, and making all the other expenditures th at corporations have made in past recoveries, with the result that capital investment plus inventory accumulation has invariably exceeded internal cash flow. In 2003, for the first time since 1975, cash flow exceeded capital investment, which suggests that there is a very considerab le hurdle—in terms of spending decisions—to which the business community is still responding. And I suspect that it relates to the corporate scandals and other corporate concerns th at have emerged in the la st couple of years and ar e still lingeri ng.  We are seeing very considerable gains in corporate prof its, and margins are up ve ry significantly.  Cash flow in the first quarter was quite strong, and analys ts are continuing to rais e their estimates for the second quarter.  In short, busin ess managers are being pulled along by the data rather than being anticipatory.  This is not unusual because we’ve had a very shallow recession and we’re not getting the usual rebound in any respect, with the exce ption of the very strong growth in profitability.  81 of 112 All of this leads me to conclude—and I think th is view is held pretty  much universally as well as within this Committee—that we have completed our period of accommo dation, which was an endeavor to address the rather substantial contra ctionary forces that beca me evident in  mid-2000.  In retrospect our policy accommoda tion appears to have worked.  Whether we will lo ok back upon this period two years from today and say that our policy was the right  policy is going to depend on how we come out of this period of accommodation.  With regard to the outlook for inflation, we have a number of indicators that we look at.  For one, as many of you have mentioned,  we have the “gap.”  I am uncom fortable with the gap analysis basically for two reasons.  One is that it requires that we view the inflation projection from the perspective of regression analysis, and that kind of  analysis always has a large element of potential error in it.  If the projected infl ation rate is above the current ra te, we’re never quite sure whether there has been a fundamen tal change in the structure of the economy, which isn’t captured by the regression, or whether the actual inflation rate is eventually going to move up.  As a consequence, unless our projections are right on  the money all th e time, which they almost  invariably are not, there are always serious questions about whether ou r gap regression analyses  are really telling us something that we need to know. Second, there is the question of  whether a single figure describe s the process.  A number of you have mentioned the sk illed labor shortage.  The very soft rise in wages and salaries in the production worker data is suggestive of the development that we’re all aware of—namely, that the skill differential has been rising fairly dramatically.  As a re sult, we have a shortage of skilled workers and a corresponding  surplus of lesser-skilled workers.   And as I’ve argued in certain speeches recently, what we are faili ng to do in this country is to raise the de gree of skill in the workforce as a whole sufficiently quickly to create a more balan ced skill supply–de mand situation 82 of 112 and in the process to re move the surplus of the lesser skilled so that we end up with an overall balance.  We don’t have that at this stage.  I’m wondering whethe r or not the diff erential pressures of stronger wage growth in skilled areas and weak er wage growth in le sser-skilled areas create problems in doing this type of evaluation.  In my view that is at least open to question. As a consequence, I think that it is important to look at the structure of underlying costs.  Because profit margins tend to be co nstrained, within limits, the issue we ought to be looking at when we are trying to ev aluate the behavior of inflation is not the core PCE or the core CPI but underlying unit costs in the economy, as best we ca n judge them.  On e way of analyzing this is to look at a set of data composed of nonfinancial, non-en ergy corporations that account for maybe 55 percent of the GDP but obviously  a significantly higher proportio n of the growth of the business sector.  If we look at those data, we see that the acceleration in costs has been very limited.  Indeed, over the last four quarters this sector has regist ered an average price rise  in the neighborhood of 1 percent.  And it turns ou t that two-thirds of that rise is re flected in higher unit profits and that actual underlying unit costs are risi ng very modestly, the result of  a combination of declining unit labor costs and declining unit interest costs, offset in  part by rising costs of energy, indirect business taxes, and business transfers. I understand the issue of whethe r we mis-evaluated the data on pr ices last year and, hence, have been operating under a presumption that inflation had gotten lower than  it actually did.  But I think that the more import ant question here is what unit costs ar e doing.  Consequently, trying to get a long-term projection of where infl ation is going may require that we  start from a higher base than the one we’ve been as suming is currently the base.  As I think David Stockton mentioned, we have now reached the point where changes in unit labor co sts have become positive .  We have to assume that there has been so me upward movement in unit  energy costs and probably in unit interest costs.  83 of 112 But one has to remember th at, whenever we are talkin g about unit costs, if the denominator is rising at a fairly rapid pace, it ho lds down unit costs, all else being equal.  So it is not clear to me that unit interest costs are in the process of going up.  Neve rtheless, I think the point here is that we are not yet in a position where we are seei ng underlying cost structures movi ng significantly.  To be sure, they have picked up in the last  several months.  In fact, my re collection of the data is that productivity growth from December  through March, as distinct from the first quarter over the fourth quarter, is in the area of ju st under 4 percent.  In fact, if I sort all the pieces of paper in front of me, I between December and March is 3.9 percent at  an annual rate.  Compensation per hour, interestingly enough, is up  at a 5 percent rate for the same period, reflecting a 3.1 percent increase in wages and salaries and significant increases in other labor income.  The latter increase, as you saw in the ECI, is to a large extent pens ion costs and medical  insurance costs. So we are beginning to see a process of increas ing costs.  But the productivity numbers are still sufficiently strong to supp ress the overall rise.  Re member, the major diff erence between 1994 and today is productivity growth.  In 1994 we didn’t have any productivity gr owth to speak of, and we had to move very fast  to contain inflationary pressures.  The reason we have been able to be patient in this recent period is that we knew unit labor costs were falling fairly abruptly, and whatever the price data showed was frankly irrelevant in that respect. I think we have a set of data here that, as far as I can judg e, seems to be co nsistent with a gradual building-up of inflationary  forces.  But I fully recognize that we ca n’t measure that by looking at different simulations as we try to do in certain re spects in the Greenbook.  I’m uncomfortable with the very narr ow ranges that the Greenbook’s alternative simulations show.  That’s because, if we look  back over the last several years or ma ybe the last decade or so and ask if 84 of 112 we were wrong at times because we misforecast the exogenous variables, I’ d say “only partly.”  Mostly, the reason we were  off was that the model structure was changing.  The coefficients inside the model were moving, and that created a whol ly different environmen t from the one we had expected.  We alter the ex ogenous variables in our simulations, but we do not change the structure of the models.  Of necess ity the simulations are base d on the assumption of a fixed model structure, and at this stage, I am a little concerned that th at may be giving us some false sens e of complacency, if that is indeed what we have. Still, the change in unit la bor costs in March, if we ’re going to take the st aff’s figure, is zero.  And with profit margins apparently c ontinuing to rise, that is suggestive of a unit co st change that on a monthly pattern is not exhibiting  any acceleration.  In that respec t, I think we can state that the pace at which we’re likely to remove our policy accommodation is going to  be “measured.”  The data could run away from us, and obviously that would create a problem.  In any event I would say that we have to position ourselve s for the possibilit y of moving at some meeting, unless we want to take the very u nusual step of making a move between meetings.  That, I will tell you, would create some extraordinary imp act in the marketplace largely because we are perceived as highly credible.  So, if we eliminat e that option, we either move today, or we wait until June.  We are not going to move today in part because we ar e awaiting, and will  soon get, a couple of major statis tical reports that could cause  us some difficulty, to sa y the least, if they differ radically from what we e xpect.  And the point of waiting until June is to be sure that we are positioned to move at the June mee ting if we desire to do so then. When I say “move,” I mean by 25 basis poin ts.  I mention that pa rtly because of the experience of February 1994.  Those of you who were here then may remember that there was a groundswell opinion within  the Committee in favor of moving rates up not 25, but 50 basis points.  85 of 112 And I went berserk for the first time and, I hope, the last time at an FOMC meetin g, on the grounds that, whatever we did, th e markets were going to respond fairly  exceptionally, whic h in fact they did.  So, on the basis of  that particular history, I would sa y that we should no t move more than 25 basis points in June.  We may move 75 basis poin ts in August.  I don’t know what we will decide then.  But the point at is sue is that, if we’re not going to move more than 25 basis points in June, then the type of statement propos ed in the Bluebook—which was more recently revised by Vincent, and I’ll read the specific rewording—strikes me as an appropriat e response to the data we now have.  The sentence as it now reads is, “At this juncture, with inflatio n low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.”   Frankly, I think that positions us appropriately,  considering our lack of knowledge.  I know that President Poole has raised the question of putting in  something about the economic outlook.  I have no objection to that particularly.  I’m not sure it adds anything, frankly.   It does add words, and I think the fewer words th at we put in these statements, the better off we are.  You will have observed that we are spending more time on this statement than we have on previous statements, which is fine.  Indeed, si nce we’re limiting ourselve s to very few issues, in  my judgment that says that this process is turning out to be the right way to do this.  In any event, to repeat myself, my recommendation is that we stay where we are an d make the few changes in the statement that Vincent suggested.  I would be cu rious to hear your re actions and get the conve rsation going again.  Who would like to start?   Governor Gramlich.  

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  First of all, I support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman.  As I said in my earlier statement, I’d prefer to  be gradual, and I’d prefer to start early and stay ahead of the curve, understanding that we can change our mind depending on the way the data come in.  To be 86 of 112 positioning ourselves for a move of  25 basis points in Ju ne is fine and would satisfy my Rogers and Hammerstein test. On the language, I actually think the sentence in alte rnative B is brilliant .  In my view it does not put a collar on us.  Second, we have no t always moved in a meas ured way.  Our policy moves weren’t measured over the cour se of ’94, and they weren’t meas ured in ’01.  So to say that we prefer to be measured I thin k does add to the dialogue.  The wording probably does not make our actions as conti ngent on the data as Bill woul d like, but it does say that  our stance is conditioned on inflation being low and resource use being slack, so it does tie into the data at least to some extent.  And to me the phrase “lik ely to be measured” really is th e gradualist mantra.  So how could I object to that?  I think it’s just perfect, frankly. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman, I wish  we were in a po sition to move to day, but obviously we’re not.  I’m among those who ha ve a strong preference not to introduce another word such as “measured” into our statemen t.  Again, we’re all tryi ng to play English major,  I think.  But I agree with your comment that we cannot know with any certainty how the da ta will come in.  Indeed, they the summer, to make more than a 25 basis point move.  Vincent, in his response to a question, indicated that he thinks “measured” will, in fact, be interpreted to mean 25  basis point moves, and I just don’t think we need to say th at.  In my view, we have enough  credibility that  we’re going to operate in a reasonable and measur ed way.  I believe we would be doing ourselves and the financial that we may later wish we had no t made.  I think we can operate just fine by dropping the word “patience” and leaving well enough alone.  Thank you. 87 of 112

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  I support your proposal.  I am a little uneasy about the word “measured” for the reasons I indicated.  If I may, I’ d like to ask you just one question concerning your thought process.  Yo u indicated that at the next meetin g we may indeed be  in a position of responding with a 25 basis point  move—to the extent that the incoming data are satisfactory—and that if the economy gets st ronger, then we will go 75. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don’t know what th e next move will be. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  I’m teasing, of course, just giving an example. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Remember, though, that we haven’t made an intermeeting move in quite a long while, and one of the reasons is that we  haven’t been in the process of making changes in our policy.  If we go back and look  at the history, we ha ve often moved between meetings. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  I agree with you.  The question I want to  ask is this:  If we got positive surprises between now and the June meeting and we felt we needed to  raise the funds rate target by 25 basis poin ts, would we also conclude that we  needed to take out “measured”? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We might. MR. SANTOMERO.  Therefore, the next move could be more on the order of 37.5 basis points—that is to say two steps,  involving both a 25  basis point increase and the removal of “measured.” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Look, unless some thing very unusual happens between now and June, I think if our first move were 50 basi s points that could crea te some real market disruption.  But if our presumption is that we have to  accelerate the pace, then I think “measured” should be dropped in June. 88 of 112

[SECTION]

 MR. SANTOMERO.  If we move  and the economy suddenly im proves in a manner that is consistent with moving further, it may be more disruptive to have put the word “measured” in the statement than to have left it out. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It may.  The tradeoff here is that a disr uption will occur now if we don’t say something like “measured.”  And we  are at an earlier stage of the economic recovery than presumably we will be later, in which case  it’s quite conceivable that  we might do inadvertent collateral damage.  If the market is likely to re spond to this statement by tightening, which we suspect it will, it’s going to tighten more if we don’t use “measured” or some similar word.  And subsequently we might find that we’re running into a period where there’s more slack in this economy than we now anticip ate.  I don’t think it’s a high probability, but the cost of a mistake here today may be much larger than the cost of a mistake later. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  With that sai d, I support your recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  I also suppor t your recommendation.  We are obviously deep into the ques tion of how we communicate with markets, and we have a general view, I think, that this is not the time to actually move up the funds rate.  So let me focus on the way I think about our communications with  markets.  My sense of it is that we want to reinforce market expectations if we believe they are about right and we want to ch ange market expectations if we think they’re wrong.  And we use communications to  do that.   As I look at exhibit 4, it is hard for me to say at  this stage that mark et expectations are fundamentally wrong compared with the judgments I heard expressed in this room—namely, that inflation is relatively low but it mi ght be picking up, though  we aren’t really sure and so we have to give ourselves a little more time.  I believe  that this proposed  language is helpful in saying to the 89 of 112 markets that we wouldn’t want to work hard to disabuse them of the expectations that have been built in at this stage for a mode st tightening probably starting some time in August.  That doesn’t mean that that assessment can’t change.  It may change as the data change, and we may move more aggressively than we anticipate.  I’m not sure.  Bu t I would definitely say th at the word “measured” will help us to avoid triggering any real snapback in expectations in the c ontext of what I continue to view as an econom y that is still workin g hard to get rid of slack.  So I’m very supportive of this language. My second point re lates to Tom’s question and others about what we ca n do here.  As I read this language—putting on my Eng lish major hat—it says basically “at  this juncture.”  So as of today, contingent on th e conditions that Ned pointed out—low inflation and slack in resource use—our belief is that the pace at which we will remo ve policy accommodation is likely to be measured.  I sense that to be an accurate re flection of where we are at this stage.  If over time, based on a number of data releases that come in, it turns out at  some future juncture that this assessment is no longer relevant, I don’t think our ha nds are tied.  In my view we can  move if we ha ve to move in not.  So I think this  language is—I know Ned used the word “brilliant,” but I thought we had moved away recently from decl aring our statements to be brilliant—certainly extr emely good.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yo u are indeed measured. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  But supportive. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I was going to  give a less ringing endorsement by characterizing the proposal as better than the k nown alternatives.  [Laugh ter]  Essentially what we’re debating is whether a statement with this endi ng is too soft, too rea ssuring about the future 90 of 112 path of the fed funds rate.  I belie ve that’s the right question to deba te.  But I think it’s important to recognize that this wording gives us the flexibility to  move in June, if necessary.  Although our risk assessment is balanced, this stat ement has an overt asymmetric bias , whichever way one looks at it.  As Roger just said, the last senten ce is qualified in at least four different ways.  It says “at this must have a range of possible inte rpretations.  Now, it’s di fficult to defend the statement both as not constraining and helpful as  a signal, but maybe that’s its virtue . [Laughter]  So I’m comfortable with it, and I support th e recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  I, too, support the recommendation.  I th ink the language does give us adequate flexibility at least for the next two or three mont hs, as best I can read  the situation.  And I’m hard pressed to suggest any better alte rnative.  So I support your proposal. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO.  Mr. Chairman, I also support your recommendation.  I have to admit that, when I first read the “measured pace” langua ge in the Blueboo k, I was concerned that it would be interpreted by markets as indicating that we had a predetermined path for moving rates up and that we would be doing it based on a time schedule rather than reacting to inform ation about the economy.  And as I said ea rlier, I was leaning toward  wanting the flexibility to  react more quickly if the data continue to come in stronger, especially  the inflation numbers.  I think the new language that Vincent proposed, “is likely to be measured,” does give us the added flexibility.   So I support your recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. 91 of 112

[SECTION]

 MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  I support your re commendation and all aspects of it.  Like President Minehan, I’d be concerned that, if we just dropped the la st sentence, the markets would overreact if not immediately then over the in termeeting period.  As data  come in, they’d start to build in a 1994-type tightening, which is what I thin k they’re looking for an d what a lot of the discussion is about in the markets.  My personal view—or at least my best guess—is that we won’t need to tighten like that.  Inflation is lower,  and I think the output gap is disappearing but is disappearing slowly.  So not sign aling the markets that expectati ons of a 1994-type tightening would be the wrong—and  allowing those wrong expectations to get built into the markets—would give us, I think, more trouble than  dealing with this word “measured.”  So I believe that we need some way of indicating that our be st guess is that the firming, wh en it comes, will be gradual.   I thought the reaction to your  testimony, Mr. Chairman, was perfect because you dropped “patience,” everybody noticed it, an d rates reacted a little but not a lo t.  And you balanced that by providing a somewhat more detailed outlook.  You said that you didn’t expect inflation to rise and you talked about the downside ri sk that you discussed earlier.  Well, we’re not doing that here; we’re not giving a detailed outlook in our statemen t.  So I think the sugge stion of a moderate and measured pace of tightening is a way of substituting for a detailed forecast in an effort to moderate the market’s reaction to ou r statement.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I support your recommendation.   I think we may need to move sooner than the markets now expect.  But that is going to depend largely on the strength of  the incoming data, even in the next week.  So I look forward to seeing what is in store for us. I very much agree w ith what Don just said.  I think if we left out sentence 8, we would be sending the wrong message.  We actually could be sending the wrong message in another way.  We 92 of 112 could be interpreted as saying that everything is hunky-dory and that we don’ t have plans to remove the policy accommodation.  That could be read as the message in the statement that the risks to the outlook are balanced, whereas sent ence 8 does say positively that, all other things being equal, we’re going to take the policy acco mmodation away.  We plan to do it in a measured way, but we’re going to do it.  I think that’s an important follow -up to your testimony as well.  Whatever way we look at it, I think we’re stuck w ith sentence 8.  We’re  probably going to take grief from some quarters for this new language, bu t I think we’re stuck with doing  this.  So I agree with your recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Broaddus. 

[SECTION]

MR. BROADDUS.  Mr. Chairman, I’ m very comfortable with you r recommendation.  I feel very strongly that we should use the “measured” lang uage for all of the reasons you have listed.  I also agree with Roger’s and Do n’s points—and Cathy’s as well.  Fundamentally there’s still a considerable amount of slack in the economy, as  I see it.  Also, and th is is a point I would emphasize, I believe that we still have credib ility for low inflation.   This is not la te 1993 or early 1994, when we di d not have credibility.  I know  there is some survey ev idence of rising inflation expectations, and there are a lot of anecdotal repo rts as well, but I don’t see any really dramatic recent change in inflation compensation or in sp reads for indexed bonds in financial markets, especially in the longer-term five-y ear to ten-year area.  Basically, I believe that we need to think differently about the potential benefits of a pr eemptive tightening of policy—or what might be perceived as a preemptive tightening of policy—in a situ ation where we have price stability as distinct from a situation where we were at the last stage of ending  a twenty-five-year war against inflation.  In my view, the la nguage indicating that we can re move policy accommodation at a measured pace would be consiste nt with these considerations. 93 of 112 Earlier, Mr. Chairman, you told me that I could have about thirty additional seconds to talk today.  If I may have about five  seconds here, I’d like  to quickly share a little anecdote that you may enjoy.  Some of you may recall that at the last meeting I was pretty much at one end of the spectrum—even beyond the Kohn camp. [Laughter]  I paid for th at at the hands of my colleague, Jack Guynn, a few days  ago.  Jack, of course, is the Presiden t of the Atlanta Fed, which is the Sixth Federal Reserve District.  But as some of you ma y know, he was actually born in the Fifth Federal Reserve District, in the Shenandoa h Valley.  He has a nice younger  brother named Doug, who is a very prominent attorney there.  I had to make a sp eech in that area a couple  of weeks ago, and Doug very kindly invited me to stay with  him.  Jack happened to be there as well.  Doug has a wonderful house overlooking the mounta ins, and he gave me a beautiful room  to stay in, and for the first time in my career, there was a bouquet of flowers in my room.  But Doug kept asking me to look carefully at the flowers.  I coul dn’t understand why un til, eventually, I saw that in the flower arrangement there was a carved wood en dove sent by his brother, Jack .  [Laughter]  Jack, that really hurts!  I hope you take some comfort that I’m  a bit closer to the center of gravity today.

MR. GUYNN.  It was fun!

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well done.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support the reco mmendation, and I’ve been looking carefully at both sentence 8, wh ich Cathy talked about,  and the March FOMC statement shown in alterna tive B.  If I compare th em word-by-word or even phrase-by-phrase, I can see only minor differences—primaril y the removal of the word “patient” and the addition of “is likely to be measured.”  But as I read the two, I think that alternative B comes across much more strongly, and I think it’s the position of the word “remove.”  We’re not talk ing about when at some point in the future the policy acco mmodation will be removed.  We ’re describing the circumstances 94 of 112 or the manner in which it will be removed.  Consequently, I would not be surprised—though I’ve never been good at judging what the market response to our statements will be—if th ere’s a stronger reaction than what many around the table have been suggesting.  Having said that, I think the statement is exactly accurate.  An d recognizing that we review th ese generally within a six-week time frame, it seems to me that this is the appropriate way to de scribe where we are as of today.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wasn’t here in February 1994, but I’m certainly going to go back and read the transcri pt to see when you went  berserk!  [Laughter]  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  My “berserkedness” was partially edited out.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  As for your proposal, I agree with your recommenda tion on the rate.  On the language, I find it hard to  disagree with langua ge that people I respect call “br illiant” or “extremely good,” but I must say th at I’d prefer a different path.  I would prefer to  drop the word “patience” and not substi tute the word “measured.”  I just do n’t like putting anothe r word into the lexicon now.  I think it is going to pose problems fo r us down the road whenever we try to take it out.  I realize that this wording is going to be approved, bu t I’d like to make a couple of comments so that the next time this issue comes up my views will at least be in the record. First of all, on the point that we conditioned it four times, I remember that at the Jackson Hole conference there was a lot of discussion about whether the markets can understand central banks’ conditioned statements, and the clear consensus was “no.”  The view was that the conditioning in a statement by a central bank doesn’t mean anything to the mark ets.  They just read it as unconditioned. Second, on Cathy’s and Don’s point about line 8,  the part of the sentence that I think is important—namely, “with inflation low and resource use slack,” whic h I agree should be 95 of 112 somewhere in the statement—could be moved up to lin e 3 and incorporated in the rationale section.  I think that would describe the situation as it is  now without having to provide a forward-looking element—in other words, without adding “measured.”  So, on balance, I woul d prefer to take that word out. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, ha ving expressed my opinion somewhat earlier and having listened to all of this commentary, at this ju ncture I want to give you my  measured response to the conversation so far and that is that  we have the direction right.  I know where we st and in that we need to be looking at the next meeting for some act ion.  And I think that’s the most important thing we’ve decided here today, so I sup port you in that.  I th ink we would be better  served not to have this last senten ce, line 8, in the statement.  We could convey this message in speeches, as you already have in some ways, over th e coming period.  The data coming  out will decide  a lot of this for us and move us toward a June time frame anyway.  But I think the mo re important element of today’s decision is that we cannot  move now and we should be thinki ng about June.  In that sense, I support your recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chai rman.  I, too, am still in the camp that wo uld prefer not have a commitment in the statement.  But I like the idea that many of us have been expressing in speeches—that the policy accommoda tion has to be removed.  Wh at I struggled with—and I was interested in listeni ng to what was said about it around the tabl e—was the word “measured.”  If I were an outsider trying to read the message in th at word, I’m not sure that  I would know what it means.  Are we trying to signal a slower pace  than in ’94—a gradual and moderate but not pre-emptive pace?  I guess we’ve come up  with a word that I don’t know the meaning of.  If the idea is 96 of 112 that it says we’re going to determ ine the pace as the f acts come in—and we’ll determine the level at that time, too—then I think we have the perfect wo rd.  I don’t necessarily think it means that we wouldn’t be as aggressive as we were, say, in ’94.  I don’t know how it relates to the average numbers that Vincent provided here because I don’t know what ma gnitude we’re talking about with “measured.”  My only concern is wh at we really want to signal.  Are we just going to determine our moves as the facts come in, or do we really want to signal a gradual pace? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The answ er to that is th at the facts are goi ng to determine policy and I should hope that the ma rkets are acutely aware of that.  If that were no t the case, they wouldn’t have been moving the fede ral funds futures around  as the data came in .  At the end of the day, if we wished to be stubborn, we could keep the federal funds futures at  1 percent indefinitely.  It would have certain odd impli cations for the economy, but we c ould do that.  We could just basically create enough reserves to make that possible. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  I guess I’m asking, Why don’t we just say that the pace at which the policy accommodation will be removed will be  determined as economic events unfold?  I’d prefer to say something like that rather than us e a code word such  as “measured.” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I thou ght that’s what you interp reted that word to mean. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Well, I’m hearing a lo t of different interpretations of  it, even around this table. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  All of which sugges ts that when we have nineteen people around a table trying to write a statement, as we’ve indicated on innumerable occasions, there are difficulties in the process. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Yes,  there are. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. 97 of 112

[SECTION]

 MR. MCTEER.  I also would pref er just to drop “patience”  without substit uting anything else, but I’ll concede that the argum ent is over.  Just so  Al can go out as the lonesome dove, though, [laughter] I would like to point out that I don’t think any of us—well, maybe one or two of us—really believes that the ri sks to our goal of price stability have  moved into balanc e.  To me, our comments indicate that we r eally believe there’s a risk of rising in flation; and I think we feel that the risk of unwanted disinflation or de flation is behind us.  So, while we  may not want to move that risk assessment two whole notches in one meeting, if we were  totally honest about it, I think we would. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We had that discu ssion about our statement earlier, as you “asymmetric to the downside” was really how we viewed the ou tlook on infla tion.  But our judgment was that we’d cr eate more problems by changing the wo rding in our statem ent than not.  And I think a two-step move— 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  I understand  the practical problem of going two steps, but I think we ought to at least recognize that.  “Like a fish” I think is the te rm we used in high school. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to make a couple of points.  First of all, with regard to long-term inflation expectations, I’ m going to use an analog y with the federal funds futures market.  Take the reading for September in the fu tures market.  We interpret that not as providing us with an y evidence about the state of  the economy othe r than the market’s expectation of what this Commi ttee is going to do.  I think that’s the only information we can extract from that observation.  By the same token, I think the long-term inflation exp ectations that we extract from the inflation indexed bond is really a statement about the market’s expect ations on what this Committee is going to do over a period of years.  We can’t ex tract any real inform ation relevant to 98 of 112 understanding underlying in flationary pressure s.  It’s really a statemen t about what this Committee is likely to do.  And once the indexed bond starts to move, the informa tion, just like the September futures reading, w ill represent the market’s  changing view about how the Committee is going to react in the future.  Once it starts  to move—if it moves to the upsi de—I think it will mean that we are beginning to lose cr edibility.  That’s the way I would interpret it. Second, I agree with Bob McTeer regarding the inflation risks.  The problem we have is that it’s not very transparent to use language that is ostensibly is about the st ate of the world and our forecast as a hint about our probable future policy stance.  That to me is unfortunate.  I don’t think there’s anything we can do about it right now because I understand  that the two-step move would send that signal.  Howeve r, I think it’s unfortunate that we have mixed-up language here that in principle ought to be about the state of the economy or  our assessment of it but it is interpreted as an indication of what our polic y stance is going to be. I share the view that going cold turkey in taking out “patience” is probably counterproductive, given the history of “a consider able period,” “patience, ” and now “measured.”  I think the market is going to read  “measured” as a nuance on “patience.”  I’m concerned about that, and I think we need to try to find  a way to extract ourselves from this  kind of language.  I would like to see language along th e following lines substitute d at some point:  “The  Committee expects that its future policy stance  will depend on the future pace of economic growth and developments regarding inflation risks.”  That’s just a statement that our  policy is going to de pend on the incoming data and, of course, the implications of the data  for our assessmen t of the risks go ing forward.  Having a very plain statement alon g those lines is to me a good substitute for the current language.  I don’t think we can just eliminate this language cold turkey; that’s going to cause all sorts of questions and misunder standings.  We have to substitu te something eventuall y.  And I would try to 99 of 112 substitute something that gets us out from under the “considerable period,” “patienc e,” “measured” progression.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bernanke. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  I support your recommendation.  I think the debate going around the table has le ss to do with our differences in outlook than that there continues to be some fundamental confusion about how we ’re communicating to th e market and what our mechanisms ought to be.  I just raise the point that we really ought to revisit these issues at some time in the near future.  Given where we are today, though, I th ink that the language being proposed is both useful guidance to the market and protects ag ainst the risk of an over reaction in interest rates that would be counterproductive both to the markets and to the economy.  Our statement is a forecast; it is not a commitm ent.  And I don’t th ink that it constrains us unduly, even if it becomes necessary to make larger moves. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Th e secretary will read the resolution for us. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  As far as  the directive is concerned, the wording can be fo und on page 14 of the Bluebook: “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks mone tary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in out put.  To furthe r its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.” With regard to the wording also being voted on, taking Vincent’s revised draft, sentence number 6, of course, is unchanged from last time.  It reads:  “The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal.”  And then we have the revised wo rding under alternative B for sentences 7 and 8: “Similarly, the risks to th e goal of price stab ility have moved into  balance.  At th is juncture, with 100 of 112 inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that  policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.”
