CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good afternoon, ev erybody.  At the outset, I would like to welcome President Yellen and President-elect Lack er to their first FOMC meeting in their new roles.  Janet Yellen, as all of you know—or at least those of us on this side of the table—served on the Board from August ’94 to February ’97.  Jeff Lacker has been on the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond since 1989 and has se rved as Director of Research since 1999.  Welcome to the table. On a less happy note, Virgil Mattingly has deci ded that his apprenti ceship here as the General Counsel of the Board and the FOMC for the last fifteen years is coming to an end.  Virgil has been in the Board’s Legal Division for th irty years.  Virgil, you r absence will be duly noted—I don’t need to tell you nor do I have to  tell any of the members around this table about the value of the contributions you have made and that have been felt implicitly in the deliberations of this organization.  The fact that we hear from you so rarely at these meetings is testimony of how well you keep us out of trouble!  [Laughter]  And that, in  my judgment, is the fundamental role of the General Counsel.  We wish you well in whatever activities you choose to pursue, and we trust you will come back and visit with us on occasion just to say hello.

MR. MATTINGLY.  After one yea r!  [Laughter]  [Applause]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Virgil always gets the last lega l zing.  [Laughter]  It has been a long run; you’ve been here as General Co unsel of the Committee for almost my full term, and it’s getting long in the tooth also!  Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes for the meeting of May 4?

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Approved withou t objection.  We will now move to the special presentation on prospective external  adjustments, and I call on Karen Johnson. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You should have a packet of charts labeled “U.S. External Adjustment” in front of you.  Our topic toda y is U.S. external adjustment.  The “adjustment” that is our focus starts with the recognition that the United States is running a larg e and growing deficit vis-à-vis the rest of the world in the use of goods and services—a deficit that makes obvious our interdependency with foreign economic behavior.  As a result, some  analysts are concerned that a change in foreign behavior at some point may have unwelcome consequences for us.  But in today’s interdependent global economy, such vulnerability is present even for those in external balance or surplus.  In our pres entation today, we will analyze the factors behind our growing external deficit and cons ider what circumstances might foster its reversal.  Of particular concern will be the implications of various alternatives for U.S. asset prices, especially the foreig n exchange value of the dollar.   One direct measure of our external deficit (s hown in the top panel) is the balance of payments concept termed the “current account bala nce”—that is, the sum of the trade balance, net investment income, and net fore ign transfers.  For many years the U.S. current account balance has been  driven for the most part by  the trade balance.  Both balances began a period of substantial decline in 1996 that was only briefly interrupted by the recession in 2001.   The price-adjusted exchange value of the dol lar in terms of the currencies of a large number of our trading partners (the dotted blue line) is central to our story for two reasons.  First, th e dollar exchange rate is an important price variable in most, if not all, of the significant demand-and-supply relations hips in our complex story.  Second, the dollar exchange rate is part of the transmis sion mechanism of U.S. monetary policy and influences U.S. inflation determination.  Note  that the dollar began to appreciate from a low point in early 1995—in advance of the downturn in the trade balance—and generally continued to rise until early 2002.  The nominal exchange value of the dollar in terms of the major foreig n currencies (the green line in the middle left panel) has come even further off its 2002 peak than ha s the more inclusive broad real dollar, nearly returning to its 1995 level.  This difference reflects the fact that, in terms of the currencies of our other important trading partners (the dashed red line), the dollar has risen somewhat in nominal terms since earl y 2002.  The dollar ex change rates of the major currencies have tended to  be more flexible and more market driven than some of the OITP currencies, such as the Chinese renminbi; an d the dollar has appreciated against some of these other currencies, in particular the Mexican peso.  Persistent current account deficits cumula te to the net intern ational investment position, shown to the right, which measures  our growing stock of indebtedness to the 4 of 203  rest of the world.  Th is large and growing st ock of claims on the United States must be held at all times, an d one intuitive perspect ive on the sustainabi lity of our external position is that this stock cannot increase rela tive to our GDP foreve r.  Every import and export transaction in the current account has a financial counterpart.  Except for measurement error, the current account balanc e equals the net of all the international financial transactions.  There are, of course, huge volum es of cross-border transactions between assets—unrelated to trade finance and driven by complex incentives of risk and return—that have consequences for asset prices , including exchange rates.  Recent data for elements of those financial flows, reported in the bottom le ft panel, show that private foreign inflows to purcha se U.S. securities (line 3) are very large, pa rticularly in relation to private U.S. outflows to purchase foreign securities (line 4) and net direct investment (line 5).  Moreover, these flow s increased sharply in the fi rst quarter.  Nevertheless, foreign official inflows (lin e 2), which had about doubled in 2003, rose significantly further earlier this year.  From a macroeconomic perspective and with the public and private sectors combined, the extent to  which the United States invests more than it saves corresponds to resources borrowed from abroad—the bl ue shaded region la beled “net foreign lending” in the bottom right panel.  This is the NIPA analogue to the current account balance.  As the rise in U.S. net dome stic investment in the 1990s outpaced that in net saving, our external deficit rose.  As our saving subsequently declined sharply, the external deficit widened further.  Unless and until the trade bala nce begins to narr ow, adjustment is not yet occurring.  Indeed, as was argued in the background paper circulated to the Co mmittee, stability in the ratio of our foreign indebtedness to nom inal GDP requires that the trade deficit eventually return to near zer o.  U.S. trade data are pres ented at the to p of your next exhibit.  The yellow shaded area represents the trade deficit, which has reached a record level.  To the right of the ver tical line, which is positioned at the latest actual  data point, we have shown a simple extra polation of imports and exports—based on standard partial equilibrium trade equations—fo r the case in whic h real GDP here an d abroad grows at potential and the real value of  the dollar remains at its current level.  With imports already substantially larger than exports an d with foreign potentia l growth reasonably robust but slightly less than U.S. potential growth, the change in imports tends to exceed that in exports, and so in this  case there is no adjustment through 2010.  The green bars measure the change in the trad e balance.  For the trade bala nce to narrow significantly, exports would need to grow rapidly relative to import growth for an extended period.  The middle panel provides a summary of the composit ion and magnitude of cross-border financial flows for the same period, expressed as a percen t of GDP.  The trade balance above accounts for most of the change in the current account balance, shown in yellow.  U.S. private financia l outflows, in tan, also must  be financed; and the sum of these two is the counterpart to foreign private financial inflows (in blue) plus net official flows (in red).  The extrapolation through 20 10 incorporates the tr ade outcome from the top panel and plausible staff projections of U. S. and foreign private financial flows.  Of course, private flows could behave differently,  depending on the incentives perceived by 5 of 203  investors here and abroad.  To the extent that the flows shown in  blue do not fully finance the current account deficit plus U.S. private outflows, foreign official intervention may fill the remaining gap, as shown here.  Otherwise, exchange rates, other prices, and incomes here and abroad wo uld change, resulting in a current account position and private flows that would sa tisfy the balance of  payments norms.  The bottom two panels provide some detail on recent stocks of dollar holdings by foreign officials (the left panel) and foreign private investors (the right panel) that correspond to the flows in the middle panel.   Estimates based on  data through April show that, of the total foreig n official holdings of more than $1,600 billion (line 1), about two-thirds consist of Tr easury securities (line 2).  The end of 2001 was very near the time of the most recent pe ak in the value of the dollar.   Changes from then through nearly accounted for by the ch ange in holdings of “selected” Asia (line 3)—economies whose monetary authorities have engaged in substantial foreign exch ange intervention.  The incentives behind dollar ac quisition by foreign officials, for the most part, relate to their objectives for their re spective exchange rates and th e competitiveness of their exports.   Foreign private holdings are si gnificantly in fixed-income  securities—lines 1, 2, and 3 in the right panel.  These investors are thus  exposed to dollar exchange rate risk and to U.S. market interest ra te risk.  Foreign holding s of U.S. equity (line 4) are also large but entail somewhat different risk s.  Over the period since th e dollar began its appreciation in 1995, foreign investors have more than doubled their holdings of each of these categories of assets.  Nevertheless, because U.S. securities market s are very large and quite liquid, changes in preferences on th e part of foreign in vestors among these categories of assets need not ha ve major implications  for their prices.  However, as long as the U.S. current account re mains in deficit, ne t foreign claims on U.S. assets must continue to rise in total.  Any diminution in the appetite of inve stors for U.S. assets would first trigger valuation ch anges, primarily via the exchange rate, that would lower the foreign-currency denominated value of th eir total claims on the United States.   Such a change in investor appetite could well be the first step  in the external adjustment process.  So me characteristics of an “orderly ” adjustment are listed in the top left panel of your next exhibit.  Although there are a great many possible alternative paths for adjustment that could be termed “o rderly,” in the sense that financial markets would continue to function within normal rang es, such an outcome seems more likely to occur if investors are attracted by improved returns abroad rather than discouraged by unfavorable changes in U.S. prospects.  Vari ous specifics along thes e paths would differ, but all would be characterized by continued, albeit declining, net financial inflows into the U.S. economy.  In addition, because la sting correction of the U.S. external defi cit cannot be achieved thro ugh cyclical slowing of  U.S. GDP growth to  below potential and the associated temporary restraint on import s, external adjustment such that exports increase more than impo rts almost certain ly requires dollar depreciation.  6 of 203  The panel to the right expresses the data on foreign holdings of U.S. assets from the previous exhibit as sh ares relative to  the total outstanding amount for each category.  Foreign holdings of U.S.  Treasury securities (l ine 1) amount to nearly  50 percent of the outstanding stock, with the of ficial share about 30 percen t and the private share (not shown) about 20 percent.  Foreign holdings ar e more than 10 pe rcent of agency securities.  The percen t held abroad is only  slightly higher for e quities, with 12 percent of U.S. equities owned by fo reign investors, virtually all of whom are pr ivate.  These numbers are large, and they have risen over time.  But moderate financial inflows could continue over time even  if these shares stab ilize or edge down.   There appears to be ample sc ope for continued financial in flows, as reflected in the bottom left panel.  For most of the foreign coun tries shown, in De cember 2002 domestic securities made up most of th eir total bond and equity holdings, in  many cases more than 80 percent.  Mo reover, U.S. securities are generally just a moderate portion of their nondomestic holdings.  Accordingly, it do es not seem to be the case that foreign portfolios are already overly invested in U.S. assets.  If stronger demand for U.S.  exports is to contribute to adjustment, from which countries might it come?  The panel on the right reports that the economies with the largest average share of U.S. exports in 2003 were Canada and western Europe (lines 1 and 2) followed by Mexico (lin e 3).  These regions accounted for a slightly smaller share of the increase in U.S. expor ts over the past two years, shown in the se cond column.  Note the jump in the share for China and Hong Kong (line 7) wh en viewed from the perspective of the change  in exports.  This increase is somewhat o ffset by the drop in Japan’s share (line 5).  Taken together, our As ian trading partners (l ines 4, 5, 7, and 8) accounted for 30 percent of the gain in exports.  Income gr owth in Asia is likely to remain quite vigorous, with dom estic demand a major source of strength.  To a lesser degree, this outcome is likely  for Canada and Mexico.  Stro ng domestic demand in those regions will be necessa ry if U.S. exports are to accelerate.   The panel at the top left of your next exhi bit is constructed to illustrate the sense in which there is a tradeoff between relative growth here and abroad and the minimum pace of real dollar depreciation required fo r the trade deficit to  narrow.  The line equilibrium trade equations, and its position depends important ly on the current starting conditions, in particular the initial size of imports and expo rts.  Given those quantities today, for any foreign minus U.S. growth gap (the horizont al axis) the unshaded area indicates what the annual rate of dollar depreciation (the vertical axis) would have to be over the near term for the U.S. trade deficit to begin to adju st, following the usual lags.  In 2003, we were well above the line, with a growth gap of  minus 1½ percentage points and real dollar depreciation of 8½ percent.  The panel shows that the stronger relative foreign growth is, the less dollar depreciation would be required.  However, even for growth outcomes very favorable to foreign activity, some dollar depreciation would be needed to get adjustment starte d.  The staff estimates that the gap for relative potential growth is currently about minus ½ percent, so we have plotted the corresponding point on the line, marked by the box, as indicative of how far to  the right on the horizontal 7 of 203  axis we might tend to be.  At  that growth gap, dollar depreciation of more than 8 percent per year would be needed to start th e process of external adjustment.   Overall, the implications for the U.S. economy of extended , gradual external adjustment—listed to th e right—include that demand on the part of U.S. residents and foreigners shifts in favor of U.S.-made goods and services, thus boosting exports and reducing imports.  In order for the United States no longer to  depend so much on foreign saving, the extent to which U.S. domestic demand exce eds U.S. production potential must decline.  Contractionary fiscal polic y could contribute to restraining domestic demand and increasing net saving.  Moneta ry policy would need to maintain full utilization of U.S. resources an d may need to offs et the expansionary implications of increased demand for U.S. good s.  Significant resource shifts across production sectors  We cannot rule out that adjustment will be disorderly.  In that case the primary concerns are about conditions in asset markets, where th ere could be abrupt price changes, increased volatility, and impaired li quidity, triggered by changed sentiment on the part of foreign and domestic investors about the a ttractiveness of U.S. assets.  Because of the role of the exchange rate in  cross-border transactions, dollar depreciation is likely to be at the center of any disorderly  event.  Given that so me depreciation is part of virtually any external adjustment, depreci ation in the case of a disorderly outcome would likely have to be large in magnitude  and abrupt in pace.  With global asset to spill over to asset markets elsewhere.   Where are the effects of such asset-price swings likely to ma tter most?  The bottom left panel contains data on ba lance sheet risk faced by U.S.  corporations via their debt denominated in foreign currency.   Foreign currency issuance is  just 4 percent of the total outstanding, and a substantial portion of that foreign curre ncy risk may well have been hedged in the derivatives ma rket.  So this channel is not likely to have significant consequences.  Foreign holdings of claims on  the United States are shown by region in the panel to the right.  In European portfo lios, especially those in the United Kingdom, and in Canadian portfolios, ho ldings of U.S. asse ts are quite large relative to their respective GDPs.  Negative balance sheet effects through declines in the exchange rate or U.S. asset prices could be expected to si gnificantly impair economic activity in those regions and to be not inconsequential for the other countries sh own.  Joe Gagnon will continue our presentation.   

[SECTION]

 MR. GAGNON.  Your next exhibi t considers the implicatio ns for both the U.S. and foreign economies of an  abrupt depreciation of the dollar that could be associated with a disorderly adjustment.  As described in the top left panel, we ex amine three scenarios that build on each other using the staff’s FRB/Global model.  We note at t he outset that these scenarios are illust rative of some of the issues th at may arise and should not be viewed as forecasts or even as  particularly likely outcomes.   8 of 203  In scenario 1, there is an exogenous permanent drop in de mand for dollar assets that would cause the broad real inde x of the dollar’s value to decline 30 percent over the next two quarters in the abse nce of any responses in domestic and foreign interest rates.  The only decline of this magnitude in the histor y of the broad real index occurred over a three-year period from 1985 to 1988.  In this and subseq uent scenarios, we assume that U.S. and foreign policy interest rates follow a Taylor ru le.  The dotted black line in the panel to the right shows that the dollar actua lly depreciates less th an the full 30 percent in this scenario, as higher U.S. and lower foreign interest rates offset some of the depreciation shock.  Column 1 of the middle panel shows that U.S. GDP (line 1) is about 2 percent higher after six quarters.  The effect  on the level of U.S. output peaks at just over 2 percent in early 2006 and then gradua lly unwinds.  Higher ou tput is more than accounted for by net expo rts (line 3), as domestic demand (line 2) declines.  By the end of 2006, core PCE prices (line 4) are 1½ per cent higher.  This pric e increase is stretched out over ten quarters, so the annualized inflat ion rate never rises more than a percentage point above baseline.  Most of this rise refl ects the direct pass-through of higher import prices (line 5), but a little  is attributable to th e rise of output relative to potential.  On its own, this shock would not be considered disorderly, and it reflects a relatively benign response to such an abrupt dollar depreciatio n.  Nevertheless, the negative effect on trade-weighted foreign GDP (the dotted black line in the bottom left pa nel) is a bit larger than the positive effect on U. S. GDP as policy rates in ma ny important U.S. trading partners hit the zero bound on nominal interest rates.  Foreign real consumption does not fall as much as foreign output  because dollar depreciation lowe rs the cost of imports to foreign consumers.  The opposite effect is at work in the United States, showing that even though dollar depreciation is good for U.S. production, it does have adverse effects on U.S. consumers.   In scenario 2, we posit th at this abrupt dollar deprec iation is associated with a widespread loss of confidence  in U.S. economic prospects th at leads to a 250 basis point increase in the risk premium on equities and long-term bond s in the United States.  The higher premium and lower exp ected profits cause U.S. eq uity prices to fall about 50 percent.  Because of the im portance of the U.S. economy  and U.S. financial markets in the global economy, it is likely that such a large drop in U.S. equity prices would spread to foreign markets.  The overall effe ct on foreign financial markets would likely be muted by safe-haven flows to government bonds in majo r foreign countr ies.  Thus, we set the size of the foreign financial shock to have half as much effect on foreign output as the U.S. financial shock has on U.S. output.  Asset-price declines add contractionary impulses to the simulation, and now U.S. GD P, sh own in columns 3 and 4 of the middle panel, declines on balance.  At the same time, th e upward pressure on U.S. prices (line 4) is reduced  a bit, owing to slack in reso urce utilization.  As shown by the dashed red line in the bottom left panel,  asset-price declines in foreign economies and spillovers from the United States have a substantial contractio nary effect on our trading partners.  Policy rate s in most of these countries drop to zero early in the simulation and remain there.  Scenario 3 considers the possi bility that, when policy rates hit zero, foreign central banks might engage in quan titative easing or ot her nontraditional policy actions to 9 of 203  stimulate their economie s.  Because the channels for such policies are not built into the model, we chose to relax the zero bound on policy interest rates and allow these rates to become negative, still following a Taylor rule.  As shown by the so lid green line in the top right panel, easier mone tary policy abroad leads to less do llar depreciation.  Nevertheless, the level of U.S. GDP (line 1, columns 5 and 6 of the middle panel) is essentially identical to that in scenario 2.  The reduced stimulus to U.S. GDP from a smaller depreciation is roughly offset by the reduced drag fr om a smaller contraction in foreign GDP, shown by the solid green line in the bottom left panel.  The smaller depreciation helps to damp the rise in U.S.  prices (line 4 of the middle panel).  The bottom right panel displays the classic J-cu rve effect of a depreciation on the trade balance.  Most of the effect s are completed by early 2006 .  The trade deficit narrows about 1½ percent of GDP from  the exchange rate shock alone and about 2 percent of GDP when other asset prices al so drop.  These scenarios engender a substantial degree of external adjustment, though not enough to eliminate the trade deficit, which is currently around 5 percent of GDP.   All together, these simulations clearly indicate that disorderly adjustment of the U.S. external balances is likely to have a very contractionary effect on foreign economic activity.  A large dollar depreciation—which is likely to be  at the heart of any disorderly adjustment—provides a substantial stimulus to  U.S. exports that offsets much of the negative effects of any financial distress on U.S. activity.  Me anwhile, lower U.S. imports are a direct drag on foreign economic activity.   In light of the dollar depreci ation that occurred over the past two years, exhibit 6 explores whether external adju stment is already under way.  The last major period of external adjustment in the United States occu rred during the late 1980s.  We find it instructive to compare the recent  experience with th at of the 1980s.  The dashed line in the top left panel displays the rise and fall  of the broad real dollar between 1979 and 1990.  The solid red line displa ys the broad real dollar in re cent years, with the peak of cycle was greater during the 1980s, but the broad contours look similar.  The recent interruption in the depreciation is more pron ounced than in any comparable period in 1985-87.  Should the recent br eak in the dollar’s downward trend persist, it would be reasonable to expect any adjustment to be interrupted.  The top right panel displays the trade balance over the earlier and later periods.  Despite th e smaller swing in the dollar in the current episode, the trade deficit as  a percent of GDP ha s widened more than during the 1980s.  Abstracting from the effects of the 2001 recession and 2002 recovery, there does appear to have been a flattening out  of the trade deficit re cently.  In the 1980s, the trade deficit did not begin to narrow until more than two ye ars after the dollar peaked—we are just now approaching the compar able point in the cu rrent episode.  The middle panel shows that external adjustment in the late 1980s wa s associated with a sustained higher growth rate of real exports (the dashed blue line) relative to growth of real imports (the solid green line).  In the cu rrent episode, the growth  rate of real imports has exceeded that of r eal exports continuously from 1997 through late last year, but the gap has now closed.  Adjustment will require a further rise in the export growth rate relative to that of imports.   10 of 203                                                   2 The materials used by Ms. Goldberg are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). The bottom left panel displa ys weighted foreign real GDP growth minus U.S. GDP growth.  As shown by the da shed line, foreign economies grew faster than the U.S. economy in the late 1980s.  Robust foreign growth und oubtedly contributed to a relatively smooth adjustment process during this period.  In c ontrast, during recent quarters, foreign economies on  average have grown more sl owly than the United States (the solid red line), and we are not projecting a reversal of this relationship in the near future.  The bottom right panel gives some indicati on that the willingness of international investors to fund  our widening external defic its may be diminishing.  Net private inflows of securities have failed to c ontinue rising since the dollar’s peak in early 2002; foreign official inflows have taken up the slack to fi nance the continued growth of the current account deficit.  A similar rise in official inflow s occurred at the beginning of the adjustment process in the 1980s.   The top left panel of your fi nal exhibit compares the recent behavior of import prices with the previous episode of adjustment.  As  shown by the red line, import prices have turned up with the dollar depreciation and the commodity price in creases of the past couple of years.  But the rate of increase is much smaller th an that observed in the late 1980s.  Moreover, unless the dollar depreciates  significantly furthe r, we expect that import-price inflation will drift down over the next year or so.  The panel to the right shows that there was not a substantial increase in core consumer price inflation associated with the 1980s adju stment.  We do not expect a major increase in core PCE inflation in the near future.  Overall, the evidence to da te points to a pause in the widening of the trade deficit, but that is far from a significant adjustment.  Indeed, as Karen mentioned previously, if the dollar remains near its re cent level we would project a renewed widening of the trade deficit.   In conclusion, we believe that recent leve ls of the U.S. external deficits are not sustainable indefinitely.  Howe ver, we know little about the path that  adjustment will ultimately follow, incl uding how long our large trade deficits can be financed.  The depreciation of the dollar in 20 02 and 2003 has helped  to slow the widening of the trade deficit, but there is no eviden ce that a sustained or significan t adjustment has begun yet.  Assuming that U.S. and fore ign output remain close to ou r estimates of potential, a substantial further dollar depr eciation is required just to get adjustment started.  The relatively orderly adjustment of the late 1980s was associated with  an acceleration of foreign economic activity and brighter invest ment prospects abroad.  On the other hand, a disorderly adjustment process would more  likely be associated with a loss of confidence in U.S. ec onomic policies and pros pects.  In a disorderly adjustment, the contractionary effects on output could well be  greater for foreign ec onomies than  for the U.S. economy.  While asset-price declines tend to depress output both at home and abroad, dollar depreciation tend s to boost U.S. pr oduction and damp foreign production.  The effect on U.S. inflation of even a large depreciation is  likely to be quite modest.  Linda Goldberg will now co ntinue our presentation.

MS. GOLDBERG.2  I will be referring to the separa te package of exhibits that you should also have in fron t of you.  My portion of this briefing on U. S. external adjustment 11 of 203  focuses on the exchange rate and trade exposu re of U.S. industries .  Some scenarios for closing the U.S. trade deficit involve depreciations of the dollar exchange rate against other currencies. Yet su ch depreciations do not affect al l U.S. producers similarly.  My background material provides various industry-level details.   In my remarks today, I highlight four broad points.  First, the most trade-oriented industries  of the United States are in the manufacturing s ector and account for almost half of manufacturing employment. There are also some high-trade-o riented raw-materials industries.  Second, these trade-oriented industries  are the ones expected to be  stimulated most by dollar depreciation.  Moreover, the currency that the dollar depreciates against is important; U.S. industries experience greater stimulus when the dollar depreciates against the euro or the yen, for example, than against the yu an.  Third, for many industries, rates of exchange rate pass-through into import prices  have been relatively stable over past rates in some commodi ties, such declines in pass-through may have been temporary.  My fourth point is th at a few high-trade-oriented indu stries in the United States may account for the bulk of the import and export adjustments induced by dollar depreciation.   We begin by turning to the levels of inte rnational trade exposure of specific U.S. industries.  We discus s three forms of trade exposure:  (1) producer export orientation—the size of exports as  a share of producer shipments; (2) the extent to  which foreign producers have penetrated U.S. markets; and (3) industry use of im ported inputs in the production processes—the share of produ ction costs attribut able to imported components and machines.  We define high-trade-oriented industries as having export orientation above 20 percent and import penetration above 20  percent. These industries, shown in exhibit 1, are concentrated in ou r manufacturing sector an d include chemicals; machinery excluding electrical; computer s and electronics; electrical equipment; transportation equipment; misc ellaneous manufacturing, such as toys and jewelry; and leather products, which is a small industry in the United States. Taken together, these industries account for 44 perc ent of U.S. manufacturing jobs .  Outside of manufacturing, some raw materials sectors are al so heavily trade oriented eith er in exports or imports.  Moreover, if we broaden our criteria to allow a more narrow focus on import penetration, we can also include apparel,  primary metal manufact uring, and furniture and fixtures.  The dark blue bars in exhibi t 1 show indust ry export shares, and the red bars display import penetration of these high-trade-oriented industries; both bars suggest producer revenue exposure to international trade.  The yellow bars  show the role of imported components in industry  costs.  The use of  imported inputs means that producer costs rise when the dollar depr eciates, as long as there is some pass-through of exchange rate changes into the prices of these imported components.  To the extent that the same producers are exposed to the same currencies on  the revenue  and cost sides of their balance sheets, producer profits are partially hedged against currency fluctuations.  All manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industrie s have revenue expo sure in excess of their cost exposure to internat ional trade.  This leads to the expectation that a trade-weighted dollar depreciation would be stimul ative, on average, for U.S. industries.   12 of 203  Exhibit 2 presents the countrie s that are the destinations for aggregate U.S. exports, as well as those that are the sources of our aggregate imports of goods.  Canada and Mexico together account for more than 30 pe rcent of total U.S. ex ports and imports.  The euro area accounts for 15 percent.  Our trade imbalance with China is suggested by the fact that that country a ccounts for only 4 percent of U. S. exports but 13 percent of our imports.  These shares of countries in overall U.S. trade transactions are similar to those used by the Federal Reserve Board in  constructing the aggregate exchange rate indexes for the United States.  However, not all industries are exposed to the same trade partner countries or, conseque ntly, to the same bilateral exchange rate movements.  Aggregate exchange rate indexes, therefore, will not reflect the changing value of the dollar from the perspective of specific U.S. industries.    This point is made clear in exhibit 3, whic h shows the shar es of the euro area, Japan, and China in the exports and imports of each of the most trade-oriented U.S. industries.  As shown in the first column of  the exhibit, the euro area is  a key destination market for our exports.  The implication is that the euro–dollar exchange rate figures prominently in the export competitiveness of, for example, chemical products , transportation equipment, and miscellaneous ma nufacturing products.  In contrast, China is a relatively small destination market for U.S. manufactured goods but is larger in some import categories.  The yuan–dollar ex change rate is significant mainly to the extent that it changes the competitiven ess of U.S. producer s relative to Chinese producers of goods being sold in the United  States and abroad.    A policy-relevant issue here is whether a dollar depreciation against the yuan would stimulate U.S. industri es.  A stimulus would most likely  occur in those industries where Chinese producers compete head to head with U.S. producers.   I address this point in exhibit 4, which presents the amount of U. S. manufacturing employment in industries with different degrees of import penetration by China.  The top row of exhibit 4 reveals that about 70 percent of U.S.  manufacturing jobs are in industries where “made in China” goods account for a lo w share (less than 5 percent) of overall go ods consumed by U.S. households.  The bot tom row shows that high le vels of Chin ese import penetration are strongest in those U.S. industries that acco unt for very few U.S. jobs (only 2 percent of manufacturing). There are few industries wher e “made in China” accounts for more than 20 percent of our co nsumption of particul ar goods.  In the middle rows of exhibit 4 are the industries with both import penetration by Chinese producers and sizable U.S. ma nufacturing employment.  Indu stries such as furniture, electronic components, photographic equipm ent, and computers and peripherals are those that can potentially ex perience a switch in  dema nd from Chin ese goods to U.S. goods and are therefore the on es most likely to gain from  a dollar depreciation against the yuan.    In evaluating industry exposure to dollar real exchange rate moves, let’s first consider the progression of the dollar against five currencies since 2000.  Exhibit 5, on the next page, shows that the dollar had strengthened against the yen, the euro, and the Canadian dollar through early 2002, before beginning its descent.  Currently, the dollar is close to its weakest level in four and a half years agai nst the Canadian dollar and the 13 of 203  euro; it has had a more limited descent ag ainst the yen.  By contrast, the dollar strengthened overall against the peso and th e yuan.  We use these different paths of exchange rates together with the weights of our trade partner countries in each industry to derive industry-specific ex port-weighted or import-weighted exchange rates.  Exhibit 6 shows the dollar depreciation experienced by high-trade-oriented U.S. industries since import-competing producers.  The recent dollar depreciation for high-trade-oriented industries has ranged fro m 7 percent to a little over 18 percent for U.S. exporters, as shown in the first data column of exhibit 6.  The corresponding depreciation for U.S. import-competing producers has ranged from ab out 4 percent to nearly 27 percent.  A key point here is that, compar ed with other high-trade-oriented industries, the industries that have China and Korea an d even Japan as large trading partners have experienced relatively less depreciation  and smaller changes in competitive cond itions since  As a final theme, in exhib it 7, I focus on exchange rate pass-through into U.S. import prices.  This theme is central to knowing whether exchange rate changes can induce enough demand-switching out of imports and exports to make a dent in our trade balance.  Pass-through is also importan t for understanding th e potentially major distributional consequences induced by ex change rates within the United States.  Exhibit 7 provides estimated rates of the pa ss-through of exchange rate changes into import prices for different bu ndles of imported commodities. The esti mates in the left column are for regressions run using data spanning the late 1970s–early  1980s through the second quarter of 2004.  The right-hand column estima tes are for a more recent period, starting in 1990.  The el asticities of import prices wi th respect to exchange rates that are statistically significant are in bold pr int.  The first two rows of exhibit 7 show exchange rate pass-through in to the prices of an aggreg ate bundle of United States imports.  The historical relationship indicate s that foreign producers generally absorb a high share of exchange rate changes in their prof it margins in the s hort run (about 70 percent) and about half of exchange rate chan ges over the longer run (one year).  A rule of thumb is that a 10 percent dollar depreciation raises U.S.  dollar import prices by 5 percent.  The stability of this  relationship between exchange  rate movements and import prices in the United States is actively de bated, especially with  regard to whether exchange rate pass-through has declined recently.  The comparison between the full data sample estimates in the left column and the recent  sample estimates in  the right column is at the heart of this debate.  Exhibit 7 highlights three important points.  (1) The U.S. dollar prices of beverage, tobacco, and mineral fuel imports are relatively insensitive to changes in exchange rates, with food prices only marginally sensitive.  (2) Exchange rate pass-through rates into the import prices of food , chemical products, and some manufactured goods have been stable over time.  A 10 percent dollar depreciation increases i mport pr ices of these goods by a cumulative 4 to 7 percent within a year .  (3) Pass-through may have declined on U.S. imports of machinery an d transportation equipment;  the relationship estimated using historical data consistently overpredic ted import prices for this commodity in 2002 through mid-2003.  This ca tegory of machinery and tr ansportation equipment has a 14 of 203  heavy weight in the aggregate bundle of U.S. im ports, which explains why we estimate lower pass-through since the 1990s on the overall bundle of U.S. imports excluding fuels.  Overall, in my judgment, it is premature to assume systematic and persistent through may have been tempor ary. Import-price observations from late 2003 into early 2004 are back within the bound s of the longer-run historical  relationships.  We may see foreign producers reaching a limit on the exte nt to which they let their profit margins absorb the adverse exchange rate movements that have occurred.  Therefore, more time needs to pass before we conclude that exch ange rate pass-through into import prices is lower than what is implied by the rule-of-thumb estimate.    I conclude by combining these themes in a way that is directly relevant to the external adjustment pr ocess for the aggregate economy.  Exhibit 8 shows the substantial role that the high-trade-oriented industries  play in overall U.S.  trade—accounting for more than 60 percent of our total exports and imports.  These are the industries on the rightmost side and bottom of each pie chart.  The significant pass-through of exchange rate changes into the import pr ices of these industries prov ides the scope for expenditure switching between domestic goods and imports.   Such expenditure switching within the United States is particularly feasible in those industries where we continue to have a production and employment presence.  In my opinion,  these industries are likely to be the ones that bear the brunt of trade adjustment in the scenar ios for closing U.S. external imbalances.  Moreover, since industrialized countries are the dominant markets for our exports, adjustments to  our international trade balance—and to U.S. jobs—will be most pronounced for changes in the dollar exchange rate against the euro and the yen rather than, for example, the yuan.  Since Chinese imports compete directly with a much smaller portion of our products, dollar depr eciation against the yu an would be less effective in the pursuit of a sizable shrinkage  of our trade imbalance.  Continual gradual more U.S. exports.  Ch anges in our trade balance will ap pear to be driven by the export adjustments.  After cu mulative large declines in the dollar, some U.S. producers might expand their market orientation to also focus on exporting instead of just U.S. markets, and this would then sp eed the overall adjustment of the trade balance.  Although import quantities are changing in th e background, too, the amount of total expenditure on imports will look relatively unchanged.  Th ank you for your attention and for the opportunity to present these points. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The last point that you made is particularly apt in the sense that we have a general tendency to evaluate thes e types of major adjustme nts in the context of historical relationships, and we don’t think in innovative terms largely because innovations are very difficult to anticipate.  Let me just say that overall these presen tations have provided an 15 of 203  extraordinarily incisive view of the nature of the adjustment processes and a few of the potential avenues through which an ultimate solution can occur. In your pass-through analysis, you made no refe rence to hedging characteristics.  We do know, for example, that in very  recent years the outstanding vo lume of dollar–euro foreign exchange swaps has gone up very dramatically.  Clear ly, to the extent that that is taking place, the greater return on exports is a combined func tion of hedging plus actu al pass-throughs.  And even though we may see a very sh arp contraction in implicit prof it margins of exporters out of Europe to the United States, for example, or anyw here, from the point of view of the exporters those losses may be fully offset through the exchange market.  And the exporters’ behavior doesn’t change until ultimately as time goes on they cannot avoid the depreciation of exchange rates.  So this is a process that  slows the extent of adjustment but  cannot alter it.  I understand the data are really quite inadequate for any industr y analysis, but we do have aggregate data, and I was wondering if you have come to any conclusi on as to what we can learn from that.  

[SECTION]

MS. GOLDBERG.  Let me start by mentioning th e response of profits to exchange rate changes.  First, at the industry le vel, if we use an aggregate trad e-weighted exchange rate to look for the effects of exchange rates on profits of U.S. industries, we don’ t see anything that is statistically significant.  If we use industry-specific weights,  then we do get a significant relationship between exchange rate change s and the profitability of U.S. firms. There is another effect of th e dollar depreciation or apprec iation on U.S. corporate profits that I didn’t mention—in addition to the he dging story, which comes through multinational activities—and that is that, when the dollar moves,  there is pretty much a one-to-one translation effect that shows up on the profits of multinational activities.  That means, for example, that when the dollar depreciates, the fo reign currency profits of these fi rms rise in value relative to 16 of 203  their U.S. dollar profits.  And that shows up as at least a temporary blip in the overall profitability of these firms. I don’t have any direct evidence on hedging activ ity and the effect that has had on pass-through and profitability, but some of the implications of exchange rates for profits are reduced by the increasing role of imported components used in production, which one can think of as another way that producers hedge  foreign exchange rates. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We do see that the goods imported into the United States in dollars from Western Europe show a far smalle r inflation rate than would be implied by the one-to-one corresponding foreign ex change rate.  That implies either a significant decline in profit margins for European exporters or a very substantial shorting in e ffect of the euro in relation to the dollar.  I gather, as I mentioned before, that th is is a very short term phenomenon.  I presume you have decided that its impact, while it may show up for a year or two, is really not a relevant consideration, largely because the fo reign exchange currency swaps almost never go beyond a couple of years. 

[SECTION]

MS. GOLDBERG.  Right.  MR. GAGNON.  Mr. Chairman, may I? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Certainly. MR. GAGNON.  We have looked, partly at you r suggestion, into whether the lags might have changed, because I think the mechanism you are talking about would likely show up as a longer pass-through lag.  Obviously we don’t have enough data to determine if this is a recent change in the past couple of years; we can’t tell.  We looked at  whether the ’90s were different from the ’80s and couldn’t find any evidence of a longer lag time.  The lags are pretty short. 17 of 203 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Looking at the broader question of the very important impact in terms of contractionary e ffects on foreign economies, are the calculations here made interactive?  In other words, are we getting two static estimate s, or are we getting a dynamic estimate—a feedback from the United States to foreign economies and back? 

[SECTION]

MR. GAGNON.  There would be dynamic feedbacks.  We use the FRB/Global model, which will simultaneously capture both effects—from the United States on foreign economies and from foreign economies on this country.  So, yes, it’s a property of the model that things that happen in the United States have a bigger effect on the rest of the world th an vice-versa, in large part because in this exhibit we  weighted the rest of the worl d by U.S. trade weights to give greater weight to countries that  trade with us a lot, such as  Canada and Mexico and Asian countries.  If we had done the weighting by ma rket or PPP-GDP, say, we would get a smaller effect.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  All of this says, at  the end of the day, that the U.S. current account deficit is rising as a per cent of our GDP, or in a certain sense as a percent of world GDP, implying that we must be getting comparably increasing surpluses elsewhere in the world.  Or put another way, this implies th at the dispersion of the world’ s current account balances is increasing.  That is almost arithme tically necessary in the data that  you have here.  Are we seeing any signs of a slowdown in the globalization proces s?  For example, in whatever time frame we wish to look, what do we see in the ratio of aggregate world exports to world GDP, aggregate external gross assets and liabilities as a percent of GDP, or any of these broader macro relationships that relate to th e dispersion of current account bala nces worldwide?  In short, granted the long delays on a lot of these types of data, which almost all come out of the IMF data system one way or another, is there any evidence th at the rate of change he re is slowing?  What 18 of 203  has been happening in the last couple of years, for example, to the data that are perhaps the most current—world exports as a percent of world GDP?  How would you describe the quarterly pattern over the last  several years? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  To be honest, I don’t ha ve those numbers in front of me. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Could you get them? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  We could certain ly calculate world exports to world GDP.  My guess is that it won’t have slowed. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It slowed down ve ry dramatically a couple of years ago. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Well, the recession. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, but has it come all the way back? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I can’t answer that exactly.  Pa rt of the problem, of course, is finding the units in which to add up world exports and wo rld GDP; that requires us to use data sources that are not available on a timely basis.  I don’t have world GDP for Q1; that number doesn’t exist. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You don’t?   What a shock!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  But what is true is that th e global recession and r ecovery tended to be more intensive in goods than in services.  They tended to be investment driven, at least in the United States and to some extent elsewhere.  And trade is more goods intensive than is GDP, broadly speaking.  So we saw imports and exports react more than in proportion to our GDP or to our weighted average of foreign GDP; a nd presumably the rest of the world, added up, experienced the same phenomenon.  I would assume that we are still on something of an uptrend and are washing through a cyclical phase, but we  can look at that and get back to you on it. 19 of 203  Of the variables that relate to globalization in a somewhat more indirect way, the only ones that I know of that really slowed were  the turnover measures on the foreign exchange probably explains why we saw declines in the volume of foreign exchange activity. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But isn’t that also a function of the rate of change in the exchange rate itself? MR. KOS.  There were at least three components.  One, there was an exchange rate effect.  Two, there was the euro.  And there was a third factor that  had to do with the increased automation in terms of how the exchange market  operated.  Electronic brokering, for example, became very, very important. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It grosses up everything. MR. KOS.  Exactly.  The numbers were down ab out 20 percent from ’98 to ’01, but all of the signals that we are getting now suggest that the survey just concluded in ’04 will show another increase. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But the grossing doesn’t tell us what the consolidated change in globalization is.  The trade balances  do, obviously, and the ba lance sheet changes do because they are all dire ctly related algebraicall y to the current account balances and, hence, to the degree of dispersion.  There is a chart in  exhibit 2 of Karen’s material, which has an extrapolation of the current acc ount balances out to 2010, when it goes to over 9 percent of U.S. GDP.  I’m looking at that and I’m saying, okay, why not?  There’s nothing in this presentation that says “no, that can’t happen.”   It merely says that someday, somewhere, somehow, that trend is going to change.  Let me just ask a quick side question.  How did you conclude in that 20 of 203  particular chart, the central one in exhibit 2, that foreign private financial flows would not add up to the gross flows and that, therefore, the net official flows had to fill in? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  That was just imposed on the chart.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I see. MS. JOHNSON.  There were some assumptions  made about continuing certain behaviors and extrapolating them and so forth, but I deliberat ely didn’t want the red to have to go away, so I told the people who prepared the chart that it should have  some red on it. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So the red is ther e first, and private financial inflows are the residual? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Well, these are hypothetical.  Of all the pieces of the story, the composition of the capital flows that will finance the U.S. current account is the most subject to change and the least predictable.  So it would be  foolhardy for us to claim in any sense that we have written down a serious forecast.  I simply wanted to show how the elements might interplay and what the pieces would be. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s actually ve ry helpful to see a base because you can always make your own adjustments.  It’s the orde rs of magnitude that I find really very useful. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Similarly, I didn’t want the tan portion to grow too much or to grow too little either.  It is important to realize that not only do we have to  finance the U.S. current account deficit but we have to take into account the real ity of U.S. investors buying claims on the rest of the world.  The elements of globalization that are making foreign investment attractive—that are allowing people to diversify, reducing home bias , and adding to this dispersion to which you referred—apply to U.S. investors ev ery bit as much as they apply to foreign investors.  So that’s 21 of 203  an additional factor.  And the flows must abid e by simple accounting conditions—they have to add up—in order to make the process continue. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Could we have a hostile takeover of world statistical discrepancy, which would help?  [Laughter]  The issue that is unknown here, as far as the dispersion of the current account balances is  concerned, is how fa r it can go.  Unless the circumstances lead to unfinanceable ratios of net claims against a country relative to its GDP, there is no arithmetical limit to how far that di spersion could run.  We ar e not seeing anything in this presentation per se  that suggests a limit. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  No, there’s just the ultimate final conditi on that it can’t continue forever. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That brings up Herb Stein’s famous quote as usual. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Yes, indeed. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s really quite a useful data system that you have set up to provide a sense of the orders of magnitude.  Unfortunately, I was distracted when you were discussing exactly what the defi nitions were of the figures in  the box in the bottom left-hand corner of exhibit 3.  This is a share of the portfolio of what? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  For each of these countries, it is the portfolios of their residents.  In other words, line 1 refers to the portfolios of euro area residents, 85 percent of which are held in domestic euro area securities. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay, it’s the residents of these countries. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Yes.  And they hold 5 percen t of their portfolios in U.S. securities, leaving 10 percent held in non-U.S. foreign securities. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay. 22 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. MINEHAN.  I’m sorry to interrupt, but is that the same measure of foreign holdings of U.S. assets shown under the disorderly adjust ment scenarios?  Is that the same thing? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Well, yes, in the sense that th e figures in column 2 would be the same.  But the denominator here is  the portfolio per country. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  And the denominator in the other is the country’s own GDP? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Yes, their GDP. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So even though the euro area has only 5.4 percent of  its portfolio in U.S. securities, that figure is equivalent to 37 percent of its own GDP? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Yes, but let me amend my answer to you a second ago.  In exhibit 3, the figure in the column labeled “U.S . securities” is bonds and equities. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  And this othe r one is all-inclusive? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  This is all claims, including foreign direct invest ment holdings—claims in the United States through that channel. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So European-owned banks are part of it? MS. JOHNSON.  Yes, and Chrysler and all th e other investment a ssets that Europeans have bought. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I’m sorry, I apologize for interrupting. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Theoretically, that  figure could go well over 100 percent.  In other words, you indicated that this struck you  as an indication that foreigners are already heavily invested in U.S. asse ts, but a country like Belgium, say, could end up with gross net claims against other countries. 23 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  In exhibit 4, my point is that  if there is a disorderly adjustment, the balance sheet effects are likely to be felt more by residents of other countries than they will be by residents of the United States. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think that was well demonstrated.  I c ongratulate you.  It was an awful lot of work, and although there we re no definitive conclusions here, I think you’ve set up a structure that gives us a detailed sens e of what is involved in the funding of the international financial system.  Questions?  Governor Gramlich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  First, I tend to be in sympathy with the view expressed by Karen and Joe that this growing external de ficit is probably going to cause troub le at some point.  It’s hard to know when.  But if I understand what you di d in exhibit 5, the disorderly adjustment scenarios, it strikes me that you may have over-pr oved the point.  If one looks at this, the real cost of the disorderly adjustment is the decline in foreign GDP.  And that, in turn, seems to come about—you have everybody following a Taylor rule, but then the zero bound is a constraint—because countries can’t lower interest rates as much as they have to in order to stabilize their economies.  So the question is, What about fiscal policy?  Would it be possible for fiscal adjustments, either here or abroa d, to stabilize these foreign GDPs? 

[SECTION]

MR. GAGNON.  Fiscal policy certainly could help.  The models are such that if you want to hit a target, you can raise or lower taxes or raise spending enough to help to some extent.  You might not like the other consequences.  But th e answer to your question is yes.  While we did not actually run those types of  simulations, the logic of the model is such that fiscal policy could help in that regard. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Has there ever been  in the international arena any evidence that governments have responded to crises by ap propriate use of fiscal policy?  [Laughter] 24 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  And these governments, in pa rticular, are already challenged with respect to fiscal policy.  [Laughter]  But it is ha rd to see anywhere on earth, with the possible exception of some Asian countries, where the g overnments themselves perceive the scope of using fiscal policy in that way, wh ether they could do it well or not. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I am not here to praise  fiscal policy.  But suppose we have a disorderly adjustment.  I think it is interesti ng, when you strip it all away , to ask, What is the problem with that?  If the problem  is really that policy either won’t adjust appropriately in the case of fiscal policy or can’t ad just in the case of monetary po licy, then that’s fine.  That’s interesting to know.  I think that is what you are saying. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  We take that point very seriously.  And it may be one reason—maybe some of you have noticed it, too—that, when we  go to international meetings, it is always the other people around the table who are complaining about the U.S. deficit and worry that it is going to cause a problem.  That may be because, in  fact, the problems from the point of view of the United States seem quite manageable relative to  the picture we get of trying to figure out how this situation is going to work itself out in the rest of the world. 

[SECTION]

MS. GOLDBERG.  Governor Gramlich, may I a dd that I agree with the outcomes of the scenarios, but there is also a lot of redistribution across i ndustries going on in the background here.  There’s a shift from capital goods sectors toward export-oriented sectors and the ones that were competing with imports.  I don’t know to what  extent the costs associated with those types of transitions are built in, but that could be an extra dr ag, at least for a while, that works itself through the economy. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  As long as I have the floor, could I ask Linda a question as well? 25 of 203 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Of course.  I don ’t know if you’re going to get an answer! [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Well, I’m sure I’ll get an answer.  Actually, I’m not sure I have totally grasped all this.  In l ooking at your exhibit 1, suppose the do llar changes a lo t.  There are three ramifications on industry that  you’ve highlighted.  One is that the costs go up, and that’s bad; that’s illustrated by the yell ow bars.  The import share is high, but it could come down if the dollar goes down, right?  And the black bars, the export share, could go up.  So you have three things going on for each of these industries, and unless I missed it, I don’t see where you have put it all together.  Have you done  a simulation with a given percent change in the dollar and looked at the cost structure, the import competitiveness, the export competitiveness, and so forth, to see how these industries come out in total equilibrium? 

[SECTION]

MS. GOLDBERG.  What I’ve done is  a bit more limited in that I’ve looked historically at the effects of exchange rate movements on profitab ility and the net effects in terms of the first two bars, which are the revenue exposures versus their cost exposures.  And I’ve found that those effects are a very significant issue for them, as is  initially this point about the translation effects on multinational profits.  The other thing I’ve looked at, where there is industry-level detail, is the sensitivity of exports and imports to exchange rate changes.  Those are the two pieces.  What we see in that exercise is that, when the dollar depreciates, the exports of these t ypes of industries respond significantly, so revenues get a real ly big boost.  On the import side, though, for these industries it’s a different story.  If you l ook at the overall U.S. economy and at how much we are spending, say, on imports of transportation goods from ab road, you find that the sensitivity of that to exchange rates is pretty much zero.  And the reason is that we end up having higher prices on 26 of 203  imported cars, for example, and importing fewer cars , so the balance of th ose effects won’t show up in our import balances.  So import sensitivit y, the amount we spend on imports, is a different story from the one conveyed by the production volume in these industries since the U.S. producers will still be expanding their own activities. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Incidentally, the input–output cost data you have are now for ’92 to ’97? 

[SECTION]

MS. GOLDBERG.  Yes. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Were these numbe rs in exhibit 1 for a specific year? 

[SECTION]

MS. GOLDBERG.  Yes. These numbers are, I believe, for 2002. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You’ve estima ted the costs using the 1997 input–output data, which is close enough or should be.   

[SECTION]

MS. GOLDBERG.  Right. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Just a quick follow-up on exhibit 5 and the diso rderly adjustment scenarios.  You indicate that for the United Stat es you have a Taylor ru le kind of reaction for policy.  In the most benign case,  scenario number 1, what kind of adjustment do we need domestically and—to the extent you can ch aracterize the international adjustment—internationally to respond to this scenario? 

[SECTION]

MR. GAGNON.  In scenario 1, we have the fe deral funds rate following a Taylor rule.  The funds rate increases 70 basi s points in the first half and gradually moves up about 200 basis points.  I don’t have a weighted foreign adjustme nt, but I can tell you that , in the case of our major trading partners, they hit the zero bound in that scenario. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Even in scenario number 1? 27 of 203

 MR. GAGNON.  Yes, but just barely.  In scen ario 2 they are quite strongly constrained; in scenario 1 they just barely hit the zero- bound constraint.  I could tell you how much they would have to lower rates if there were no zero  bound:  Japanese rates would be down 300 basis points, and euro rates would be down 400 basis points. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  If they didn’t hit the ze ro bound, your scenario  1 line wouldn’t go much below zero, would it? 

[SECTION]

MR. GAGNON.  No, because they just barely hit the zero bound.  So, it’s true that if you’re looking at the eff ect on their GDP—is that what you’re looking at? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. GAGNON.  In that case, in  the bottom left panel, the do tted black line goes down to minus 1½ percent rather than minus 2½ percent. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  In some sense, if monetary policy could work immediately and without friction, none of the GDP lines woul d move in this scenario 1. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG.  Just a follow-up.  The orderly and disorderly adjustment scenarios are based on where we are toda y, if I understand correctly? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Yes.  And in some sense, th e elephant in the room  is the size of the current trade balance. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  You’re saying that this can continue, though you don’t know for how long, and as it does—  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  The elephant grows. MR. HOENIG.  The consequences grow.  And yet there is nothing we can do about it, which is an interesting conclusion. 28 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  In some sense, there’s nothing we need to do about it.  On the other hand, I do lose a little sleep over that conclusion.  But I do believe that global capital markets are better at deciding where the worl d’s capital ought to be  put than almost any other mechanism I can think of.  

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  But we know that at tim es it gives us a terrible headache. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  It can.  And it’s certainly true that factors like U.S. fiscal policy bear on the intertemporal consequences of allowing this deficit to run.  It bear s on a much broader issue of intertemporal resource utiliz ation in this country that incl udes our borrowings from abroad and our repayments or servicing of those borro wings going forward.  So, I am inclined to say when I look at exhibit 2—I agre e with the Chairman—that it could happen.  It is perfectly plausible that there will be no adjustment through 2010.  But then I look at the diagram on the top left in exhibit 4, and every ye ar that goes by that the deficit ge ts bigger, that line shifts.  So what it would take to get us going in the othe r direction becomes a bi gger and bigger hurdle over which we have to jump.  The interplay of those things and whethe r the world’s economic resources are being best allocated by all the millio ns of decisions that are being made by people everywhere is the conundrum in a ll of this.  It is not an immedi ate issue.  It is not going to produce a crisis tomorrow.  It might not ever produ ce a crisis.  But embedded in this situation are these issues that are a concern. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We have a long li st of people who wish to speak, but I think we can break for coffee at this stage.  Let’s get back in ten minutes, plus or minus thirty-three seconds. [Coffee break] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 29 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you.  I’d like to take us back to a point that Linda made in passing because it’s one that worries me a bit.  There is the sense not just that an adjustment between the consumption of foreign-produced go ods and the consumption of domestic goods is involved but also that there would be a switch in the nature of goods, with a move toward fewer investment goods and perhaps more final consumption goods.  As you’ve looked at this—particularly you, Karen—have you thought very much about what the implications would be for the U.S. economy before we get to the disorderly  type of situation—in an  even less benign case than described in the list of im plications in exhibit 4?  I su spect one of them would be less investment and potentially slower productivity growth here over the long term.  Linda, maybe you could start by picking up on the points you were making just in passing to Governor Gramlich about investment goods versus consumption goods.  How might that adjustment play into it, and more broadly, what are the implications of that? 

[SECTION]

MS. GOLDBERG.  Well, if the dollar depreciation is part of the larger switch of investor sentiment, for example, out of asset holdings in the United States, we’d have higher interest rates and lower investment spending.  In terms of the overall GDP effect, that is offset to a large degree in the simulations by the expansion of production in export- oriented and import-competing sectors.  I don’t think the scenarios ge t into how costly the pe riod of dislocation is—involving the transfer of workers between industr ies or types of jobs or perhaps a temporary period of capital reallocations.  I think that is the context. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Linda is referring primarily, at least in the last porti on of her answer to you, to what we might call adjustment costs.  The mix of U.S. GDP that would come out of this depends entirely on just where the shock starts , how it makes its way through the economy, and in particular, how monetary policy has to respon d.  In the event that the shock began because 30 of 203  asset preferences turned against dollar assets, we  would get one sequence of events.  We would get stimulus.  The United States in any scenar io has to produce more tradable goods and fewer nontraded goods.  So, in some sense, the shift has to involve a move into manufacturing and certain sectors that we all know and love, and against certain sectors that we may think we probably are overindulging ourselves  in anyway.  [Laughter]   

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  We’ve got a buddi ng politician here!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  That mix shift doesn’t necessari ly have to mean that it is somehow an unwelcome development in the U.S. economy and that we’re going to have a smaller manufacturing sector.  We may have a bigge r manufacturing sector.  We may have more investment in certain sectors, but we’ll ha ve less investment in  other sectors.   Looking at the same set of relationships —and using the vocabul ary of the national income accounts—we do have to shrink our savings– investment imbalance.  We have to lower total investment and raise total savings so that they  meet, or at least come closer to meeting than they do now.  The lower dollar will be a terms-of -trade change to the United States.  U.S. consumers will have less purchasing power over the world’s goods, broadly defined, than before the dollar fall; that will be a force against c onsumption, and it favors investment.  The really critical thing would be that monetary policy, ev en in some orderly scenarios I could imagine, would have to tighten to restrain excess aggreg ate demand that would otherwise emerge in the United States owing to the expansio nary shock of dollar depreciation. But if adjustment were to begin by fiscal tightening in the United States—if that were among the first things to happen—or by a spontane ous increase in U.S. saving rates owing to demographic effects or some such development that brought down interest  rates and exchange rates and lowered domestic demand, monetary policy might even have to ease.  In that world the 31 of 203  mix of investment and consumption and government spending that we’d ultimately get would be different.  So, that’s not predetermined.  The mi x could come out a variety of ways.  But the savings and investment imbalance has to close.  That much we know for sure. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I would just add, though, that  in the case of this asset preference shock that Karen noted, we are going to have hi gher real interest rates, which will crowd out a certain amount of interest-sensitive spending.  Some of that will fall on housing investment and some on consumer durables, but some of it will fall on business fixed investment as well. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  A lot of this adjustment takes the differential in productivity growth rates in the United States versus foreign economies as exogenous.  And what those differentials are really  has a great deal to do w ith the adjustment process. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Yes.  Indeed, in the b ackground paper we reported another model simulation, which we did not describe today, that  makes the shock the productivity story.  It involves a one-time productivity shock that works its way through the whole global economy.  And you can see how that world looks different from the one in which asset preferences change. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  But I think to some degree the conclusion from all of this, Karen—your point that exhibit 5 suggests that it’s more the rest of the world’s problem than ours—is not quite right.  There’s obviously a reason for all of us to be worried about the outcome from even an orderly adjustment.  As you indicated, depend ing on the way the adjustment starts, we as a society might be relatively unhappy with the outcome or relatively happy with the outcome.  So let’s be cautious about saying it’s  no wonder that representatives fr om other countries ask us at various meetings we attend what we’re going to a bout our external deficit.   It’s something we have to be asking ourselves as well. 32 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  Yes, right.  But a stark case of that point is the difference between productivity opportunities emerging abroad that attract capital abroad, as opposed to just a widening of the risk premium because people beco me disheartened by the course of policy or the politics or the outlook for the United States for some reason.  The whole mix of saving and investment globally and the accumulation of capit al depends on just these kinds of factors. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  First, let me compliment everybody who made a presentation today and those who wrote the papers because I think they did an extraordinarily good job—for those of us who don’t live in this  arena all the time—of making a lot of complex things quite interesting and quite compelling.  I want to ask a couple of questi ons, and then I just want to make a comment.   My first question relates to what seems to me a difference between the two papers regarding the impact of a deprec iation of the dollar on overall pri ce changes, as measured by the PCE as the Board staff does.  It looks to me as though Linda’s presenta tion suggests an impact that may be a third bigger.  So I wondered if I got the numbers right ther e or not, and I may not have. The second question was a reaction to Karen’ s statement about why people from other countries are concerned about this.  It may be, in terms of portfolio analysis, that it is not a very big allocation to have in the euro  area—let’s say, 5.4 pe rcent of the portfolio in the United States.  I know that a broader definition of holdings of U.S. assets was used for that calculation than for the ratio of U.S. asset holdings to a country’s ow n GDP.  But I was struck by those latter figures.  If you assume that something of a disorderly natu re happens relative to th e U.S. currency and the U.S. economy in terms of an adjustment on the trade side and 37 percent of a country’s GDP is 33 of 203  somehow involved, I can see where that could ca use them to be concerned.  People in other countries know that adjustments on our side will need to be bigger as time goes by, and the impact on them could get bigger as well.  So, it is not surprising to me that they are every bit as concerned about this as they think we ought to be.  It worries me that we are not that concerned. Finally, I thought your first chart in the external adjustment ma terial was very interesting.  The chart on the bottom right-hand side on U.S. saving and investment shows that over time we had a great deal of net domestic investment a nd then we had the bust in 2000 with the stock made the point that, if net savi ng had continued at the level that  it was in 2000, say, the current account deficit wouldn’t be anywhe re near as big now as it is.  That, of course, corresponds pretty much in time with the swing of the fiscal deficit from something like plus 2½ percent of GDP to minus 4 percent or so of GDP.  We  recently hosted a conference where everybody was quoting Herb Stein all the time because of the fisc al deficits and trade deficits.  Every speaker started off with a quote from Herb Stein.  One of the speakers—actually it was Ted Truman—made the point that the twin deficits aren’t twins but they share a lot of DNA, with the DNA being related to the na tional saving rate.   It seems to me that we don’t have a lot of options in terms of co rrecting something that—though it is getting bigger and it s consequences are in some sense more dire all the time—ultimately has to come to an end.  In my view, one of the ways that policymakers would have the most control over the outcome woul d be to do something about the fi scal deficit.  It was rather interesting to me that you seemed  to tiptoe around the fiscal deficit in your paper.  You talked about how that could be a correction mechanism,  but there was no prescription discussed in the 34 of 203  paper.  That may be because we don’t control fi scal policy; I suppose that’s possibly why.  But that seems to me something that may deserve a little more attention. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Let me answer your questi ons in reverse order, if you don’t mind.  There is a difference in some of the conclu sions we draw about pa ss-through, and I think it would be worth airing that a little. You might ask, What if we ju st extended that sa ving line, wouldn’t everything have been wonderful?  But the point of that panel on savi ng and investment and re lating it to the other information on the same exhibit is to try to em phasize the general equilibrium nature of this process.  It is true that fis cal policy could help.  Fiscal polic y is the one textbook answer to doing something in the right direction to resolve this problem.  But let’s say that government expenditures were cut for whatever reason—just hypothetically, in a thoug ht process—to match whatever might otherwise have happened and we ke pt the saving rate suffici ent so that the line for saving would have been horizontal.  A lot of  the cutting of government spending would have been on domestically produced goods, not internationally produced goods.  There is no magic direct channel from fiscal policy to traded goods or to our trade deficit. We do simulations asking what the outcome for external adjustment would be if we assumed a fiscal policy action of this or that size.  If we put a contractionary fiscal policy in place that lowers domestic demand for an unc hanged exchange rate and everything else, momentarily we have slack resources in the U.S. economy.  The model then tells us that monetary policy should respond a nd should stimulate the economy to  get utilization of resources back to capacity.  But the mix of GDP will now  be different.  By c onstruction, we cut G, government spending.  The question is, Are we going to get more exports?  Are we going to get more of some other component of domestic dema nd?  And the answer to  that question depends 35 of 203  importantly on the interest el asticity of the components of  domestic demand, the interest elasticity in our model of the exch ange rate, and the exchange rate elasticities of exports.  So as we do this exercise, filling that hole from fiscal policy, we get back a fairly substantial amount of domestic demand.  And the adjustme nt that we get in the external  balance is only a portion—and it could even be a small portion—of the change that was made to fiscal spe nding that started it.   

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So basically we would need three things to happen domestically and one internationally.  On the international side, foreign economies have to grow faster.  Domestically, we have to have more saving, hop efully not too much less investment, and the fiscal deficit has to go down a little. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Right.  I think we’re confusing endogenous and exogenous things here, which makes me a little nervous.  But somewhere along the way there needs to be a mechanism that “crowds in,” to use David’ s language, exports and helps to get external balance out of the fiscal action.  The same story would have been true had the original shock just been a spontaneous increase in saving rate s on the part of the private sector .  What delivers the external adjustment is that the exchange rate change s; and it changes the relative price among the components of GDP.  The result is that peopl e, both producers and consumers, shift their behavior in a way that makes net exports fill that hole as opposed to other components of domestic demand.  The interest elastic compone nts also come in to fill that hole.   

[SECTION]

MR. GAGNON.  And in the staff model, it w ould be about $1.00 of trade adjustment for every $3.00 of fiscal contraction. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  You did have a 30  percent figure in there.  Bu t 30 percent is better than nothing. 36 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  I will take thirty seconds on this question about whether these numbers in exhibit 4 are big or little, and then we will turn  to the pass-through question.  It is true that the 37 percent of GDP for Europe or the 56 percent of GDP for Canada that are shown in that exhibit are big numbers.  But remember, on this basis, capital output ratios for economies are numbers like 300.  So, though these economies hold claims on assets that are multiples of their GDP—and their claims on the United States may be 60 perc ent of their GDP—you want to put it in that perspective. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Oh, okay. MS. JOHNSON.  We’ll turn to th e pass-through question.  Linda. 

[SECTION]

MS. GOLDBERG.  We do have a disagreemen t on what we think the pass-through is.  I’m guessing that, in the end, there won’t be as mu ch disagreement about that going forward as it might appear.  Let me go through what the diffe rence is.  When I talk  about pass-through of exchange rates, I’m referring to the pass-through of  exchange rate movements into import prices, and I’m giving as a rule of thumb a pass-through of  one-half.  In the Board’s simulation model, I think it’s about a th ird, or 30 percent. 

[SECTION]

MR. GAGNON.  About 25. MS. GOLDBERG.  It’s about 25 percent in the Board’s simulation model.  So we have a different sensitivity of import prices to exchange rate changes, and that has a number of effects in terms of what you see here in our materials.  Looking at exhibit 5 in Karen’s and Joe’s material, the disorderly adjustment scenarios, if the pass-through of exchange rate movements into import prices were higher,  there would be more import-pr ice response and more core PCE response.  We’d probably have as well a larger relative price adjustment between imported and domestic goods, and we would see more of a net export response, more expenditure switching 37 of 203  going on in the model.  That’s how that change w ould manifest itself in that scenario; a higher pass-through would give you more inflation and more of a net export response. So then the question is, Why do we have a di sagreement?  Part of it reflects how we estimate this, and part of it reflect s how we view the current data re lative to history.  Is the recent history most relevant?  Is the l onger history most rele vant?  What I see is that the pass-through did decline; it seemed to be lower over the 1990s.  But recent price observations, while on the low side, are still within histor ical bounds.  So which is it?  Do we have a permanently lower relationship, or are we on the low side of someth ing that historically has been high and low?  I tend to go with the longer history in part because , after we’ve had a strong dollar period, foreign producers have been able to be quite profitable a nd build up their margins.  That also gives them scope for accepting lower margins for a while, but that’s a finite process.   One interpretation is that, in  2002 or early 2003, foreign produ cers were living off the fat of a strong dollar period, and maybe  that’s not a long-run relationship to be lo cked in.  Also if you think of the Asian countries, China’s prices haven’t been changing against the dollar because their currency is pegged to the dollar, so China’ s competitors might have been more constrained in moving their prices.  Whethe r or not that is something th at can persist is debatable. 

[SECTION]

MR. GAGNON.  I think we agree on what we’ve seen in the past and, of course, we both are wondering what will happen in the future.  I’d just like to say that I believe a lot of the differences in our views come from how we th ink about commodities.  That’s an issue to consider going forward.  We both looked at impor t prices, disaggregated and aggregated.  When we look at aggregated import prices, we tend to put commodity prices separately in our regression in addition to exchange rates.  We, too, find that there was less pass-through in the 38 of 203  1990s.  The question is, What is the story lately ?  I think that’s where we may have some difference. In the past few months we’ve been saying that  more of the rise in prices has occurred because commodity prices are rising, which we think has some exchange rate component but also has a large cyclical component—domestic demands in China or, more broadly, a world demand component.  To our mind, that may expl ain why the pass-through seems to be higher lately.  Time will tell which will turn out to be right.  Frankly, I have a lot of sympathy with perhaps a return to a higher pa ss-through in the future  because I think, as Linda said, the lower pass-through in the ’90s might have been becau se it was a time when China’s economic growth was rising and their currency was pegged to the do llar.  Even though a lot of countries in Asia had exchange rate movements up and down in the ’90s, for those who compete with and integrate their production processe s with the Chinese, there wa s an 800-pound gorilla that they couldn’t really compete against.  So they were forced to price along with China, and China’s currency was tied to the dollar and thus our pa ss-through estimates would fall.  When we’ve looked bilaterally at which c ountries seemed to have passe d through less in the 1990s, it was Japan, developing Asia, and Mexico.  So it’s quite po ssible that, if China were  to revalue or think of a change in that respect, all bets could be off.  Maybe we’d go back to the historical pass-through.  The jury is out on that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow.  

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, my question wa s asked already, so I’m going to pass. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bernanke.  MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Joe, in modeling the current account deficit, you have to explain where it came from.  A big part of your st ory is that U.S. assets  and foreign assets are 39 of 203  imperfect substitutes, and there was a big exogen ous increase in the foreign demand for U.S. assets.  I understand why you did th at, but that’s a very important assumption.  The elasticity of substitution between our assets and foreign assets is going to affect many aspects of the model.  For example, if it’s inelastic, a change in the demand for U.S. a ssets on the part of, say, foreign central banks would have a large e ffect on the value of th e dollar.  So I guess my question is, Do you accept that implication?  What would be th e effect of assuming a much more elastic relationship in demands between different assets?  How central is  this to your basic story? 

[SECTION]

MR. GAGNON.  You are referring to th e background paper that we circulated? 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. GAGNON.  In that we had a somewhat di fferent model simulate a rise and fall in the current account balance.  I’m not sure that we are here to hang our hat on one explanation for the rise and fall of the current account; clearly  a number of things were going on then.  I wouldn’t say that the portfolio pr eference shock is entirely the st ory.  But one reason that I chose to highlight it, to some extent, was that, if you look at a number of variables in the U.S. economy at the time—interest rates, outpu t, inflation, the exchange rate, the trade balance, and so forth—it’s the one shock that sort  of moves things jointly together we ll.  That doesn’t mean that some other combination of shocks might not also have  worked out that way.  But it is one that does work out that way.  So in that regard it has some nice features.  Another obvious shock that we highlighted was the productivity shock, and the r eason we didn’t use that alone is that it just doesn’t do enough.  You’d need a much bigger productivity shock in our model for any reasonable calibration to e xplain the trade balance. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  I was also pointing out that this assumption has important implications for the way the model works.  For example, relatively small changes of demands in 40 of 203  the portfolio can have large effects on relative asset prices.  How sensitive are your simulations to that assumption? 

[SECTION]

MR. GAGNON.  That’s a very good question.  I don’t sense that it is  that important.  A movement in foreign exchange intervention of, say, $100 billion or so in the model is not going to swamp the exchange rate, if that’s what you ’re saying.  Is the portfo lio balance built to do that?  No, I don’t think it would do that.  I actu ally can’t point to specific evidence, though, so that assumption—because these are very large numbers.  Even intervention of large amounts by the standards we are used to is not going to be  large enough to make a difference.  We’re talking about a trillion dollars.  But your point is a good one.  As a modeling convention, it really helps in terms of actually solving thes e models.  It’s quite normal in these kinds of models to put in something like this because the model can be  stable and you get to a steady state you can understand.  So it’s not unusual to  do that, but it’s a good point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. MR. OLSON.  Coming back to the point that  several have made about the frustration with the absence of a response to the external imbalance issue, there has been talk about a fiscal policy response and even a monetary response in  the instance of a disorderly threat.  My question—and I asked this of Joe at the break—is wh at the effect would be if the United States signaled a change away from a strong dollar policy.  That is a posturing change, assuming we are not actually intervening.  What would be the impact of the Secretary of the Treasury saying, à la John Connally, “We’ve thought this through again, a nd actually a 10 percent drop in the value of the dollar would seem to be appropriate at this time”? 41 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  The one stumbling block in tr ying to analyze this problem that we’ve encountered since we began—we have  a little cottage industry here, and I have been doing this for eight or nine years of my life now—is that we don’t have th e capacity to relate exchange rates, in real time or hypothetically in a model, to a number of variables and have a deterministic relationship among those variables and exchange rate s that works very well at all.  So we are always forced to pose the problem  and structure the answer in wa ys that don’t require that we claim that we can forecast exchange rate deve lopments.  We talk about relationships, but we don’t say that the dollar will do this  at a certain point in time or even that the dollar will do this in response to the current account, which is an ope n issue that we didn’t even raise here.  We have lots in here about how the dollar affects the deficit implicitly.  In Joe’s simulation, the dollar is driving these things.  We don’t really have anything a bout how the deficit is feeding back on the dollar because being able to explain determination of exchange rates is the weakest link in international economics going.  We don’t have an answer, and others don’t have one either.  I’m inclined to think that, if Secret ary Snow rented out Yankee Stadium and made the announcement you indicated, the dollar would move .  But I wouldn’t be basing that on an understanding of economics.  [Laughter]  It would be more my understanding of the politics in the United States and what I think traders would do because that’s what they think other traders would do.  

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  Well, let me come at it from th e other direction.  What is the impact of staying pretty close to the posit ion generally espoused by the S ecretary of the Treasury—except for O’Neill who was somewhat more flexible on it—of being supportive of a strong dollar position?  The current Secretary has maintained that  position, at least as I understand it, of being supportive of a strong dollar. 42 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  Part of me clings to the hope that oral intervention of whatever sort has a marginal and only transitory effect on exch ange rates and that deep down the economic fundamentals drive the process, regardless of what anybody says. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  So that ought to work the other way also, on the downside? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  It should. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I have a que stion for Karen and Joe.  Karen, do you want to hazard a view on whether the probability of a benign adjustment exceeds that of a malign disorderly adjustment?  

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Ask her to pred ict the exchange rate!   

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  We’re just not in the business of predicting crises here.  Down deep the things that make the U.S. econom y different from the rest of th e world I think are overpowering in terms of the role of the dolla r, notably the size of the economy, the flexibility of the markets, and the depth and size of the asset markets.  Th e notion that the world’ s investors will truly become so disheartened about the U.S. economy that they will produce something that would look like a disorderly adjustment strikes me as re mote.  On the other hand, I was an adult in the 1970s and early 1980s, and I remember periods when  the dollar was thought to be a very weak currency.  And I remember periods when Federa l Reserve policies weren’t well regarded.  So I’m not about to say that could never happe n.  I just don’t see it happening any time soon. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  So in a se nse, you think we control the risk?  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  If U.S. macroeconomic po licy remains well grounded, if the value of goods in terms of U.S. dollars is  well maintained by this Committee, if nature doesn’t impose some truly exogenous crazy event on the U.S. econom y, and if U.S. fiscal policy could get a little 43 of 203  better, I think those are the thi ngs that will determine how this situation evolves.  But, you know, when I read my own briefing I realize what it m eans—that this problem is going to continue to grow.  And I remember Herb Stein’s admonition a nd say that this situation can’t go on; at some point, in some way, an adjustment  has to occur.  The paper had a rather benign outcome in which the productivity differential just worked its wa y through the system and things more or less corrected.  I can certainly  imagine, if the same sort of productivity shock that hit the United States were to become evident abroad—which we keep looking for—that it would accelerate that process even more.  And those stories do exist.   Those adjustment paths are very credible.

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I want to come b ack to scenario 1 in your exhibit 5, in which you have the dollar falling 30 percent in a year.  Certainly an outright cliff of that magnitude in a year— 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  It’s in two quarters actually.  

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  In two quarters.  And you assume that comes with no increase in risk premiums on other U.S. financ ial assets.  I’m asking how  realistic is that?  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  No, no.  You should think of scenario 1 as just an in itial description of an element that is in the whole se t of scenarios.  We didn’t really  mean for you to take scenario 1 seriously without scenario 2 coming along as well.  That was more an anal ytical clarification.  We think that much dollar depreciation would roil markets.  

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  In that short a time period. MS. JOHNSON.  Yes, in that short a time peri od.  As indicated in exhibit 6, starting in 1985 a depreciation of that magn itude occurred over 2½ years. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  And in 1986 we sat here and had a conversation—one in which I actually participated, sort of in Linda’s role—and tried to ferret out what the consequences were 44 of 203  going to be of the dollar depreciati on that was in train and how mu ch dislocation there would be.  We were all concerned about whet her there would be enough domestic  capacity to meet the shift in demand that was going to take place toward  tradable goods and away from other goods.  We wrung our hands a fair amount about that.  But in retrospect, it’s clear that there’s a lot of flexibility in the U.S. economy.  And given that  the shock took place over 2½ years, there was in a sense plenty of opportunity, therefore, for the pr ivate economy to respond more smoothly to it.  So there was less risk associated with the rising ri sk premium in financial markets.  That process occurred more smoothly, I think, than we thought was likely to be the case ahead of time.  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  In my own mind—Joe actually did this page, so he might have a different way of explaining it—I don’t think of the shock in scenario 1 as causing the shock of scenario 2.  If people were to wake up and deci de that they didn’t want  to hold claims in the United States, that would mean that all those th ings would occur at once.  People simultaneously do not want to hold dollar claims but also do not  want U.S. equity or U.S. bonds, et cetera. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  So you’ve drawn no particul ar policy implications in terms of things we could do to mitigate the risk  of an adverse outcome beyond what we would do anyway, such as try to keep monetary policy cred ible, inflation expectati ons low, and rediscover fiscal virtue.  Another question is, Does it matter at all what happens to ex change rate policies in greater Asia?  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I see that as affecting the pat h.  In other words, those countries are in some sense financing our deficit.  Official finance is a variant of private fi nance; it has different incentives behind it and perhaps works through othe r asset markets a bit differently.  But what the Asian official sector is now doing is in part  financing a continuation of the deficit as opposed to triggering or even participa ting in the adjustment process.  There are some risks embedded in 45 of 203  that.  There are some who feel that the decisionmaking in the official sector is a bit more political; it is not comparable to the kinds of decisions and th ought processes made by those in the private sector.  Also, the sums are getting very  large so that the holdin gs of foreign claims on the United States are becoming concentrated in a very few spots.  Huge sums are held in the Central Bank of Taiwan and the People’s Bank of China; that in and of itself sort of changes things a bit.  On the other hand, I’m  inclined to think that those o fficial entities are not likely to shoot themselves in the foot if th ey can help it.  So there are plus es and minuses, I guess.  If they change their exchange rate strategy, I would exp ect them to change their reserve management strategy; I think those two things  will go hand in hand.  While it wi ll matter to the specifics of the path, I don’t think it’s a deal breaker.   

[SECTION]

MS. GOLDBERG.  May I just add one point?  I fully agree, but in addition to the exchange rate policies in greater Asia, there’s the question of whether demand management there can ultimately help push toward the benign out come.  If we get increased openness and thus greater consumption of U.S. goods—so that basica lly those markets become more of an export destination for us than they have been—that can help facilitate the expo rt expansion that would produce a more satisfactory outcome.  That said, Asia is still a pretty small share of overall world spending and that effect isn’t going to be tremendous; but it could help on the margin.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn.  MR. KOHN.  Actually, I was going to ask about  this last point, the Asian dollar block.  Let me just ask one variant on that.  The Eur opeans sometimes complain that the Asian dollar block forces more adjustment through them.  But I w ould say that that is not necessarily the case.  It could mean that the Asians, by absorbing thes e claims, are stopping the total adjustment from happening.  It’s not necessari ly true that they—   46 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. JOHNSON.  That is certainly the attit ude that the staff has taken.  We’ve even written those points down, and we’ve asked the Ch airman to say them out loud, and he has.  [Laughter]  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And nobody knocked me down!   

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  You’re just followi ng orders, I know.  [Laughter]  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  In part, it goes back to this  unanswered question of exchange rate determination.  In essence, that conclusion follows  from a kind of portfolio  balance theory of the exchange rate.  What it says is that, when the Ch inese, for example, take dollars off the market and out of the hands of the priv ate sector, they make dollars le ss abundant relative to Chinese renminbi.  That is true, but they also make dolla rs less abundant relative to European currencies.  So in essence, they absorb some of the dollars  that would otherwise be putting pressure on the euro and any other currency you care to name. That’s  because there is this  big portfolio balance issue and relative supplies are a factor; so anybody who buys dollars in some sense is helping the other currencies, not hurting them.  But that isn’t the only theory of exchange rate determination that one might want to adhere to.  And given that none of these theories is empirically very satisfactory, it is possible to c onstruct the story another way a nd get a different conclusion.  

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  While I have the floor, let me make one comment on fiscal policy and the exchange rate correction—the fiscal rectitude poin t.  I’ve told the same story that we’re telling here, but I also remember the lively discussion th at Chairman Greenspan started in Jackson Hole about ten years ago, when he said that he though t narrowing the federal deficit would strengthen the dollar.  I think the channel he  was thinking of was confidence.  So if we had a circumstance where the fiscal situation looked explosive and we started narrowing the deficit, it’s very hard to 47 of 203  tell what the effect on the dollar would be.  The models say one thing, but who knows in real life?  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  There are time-varying and pol icy-varying risk premiums on most of those equations, and we can get different outcomes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies.  

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  I have two questions.  The first one is for Joe and Karen because I was thinking about financial markets as they apply to the analysis that you did, especially in the first paper that was distributed to us  on June 16.  When I look around the world, the United States has really been very innovative compared with othe r countries in terms of the types of private securities traded in our markets in part because of the depth and liquidity of our markets.  We have been innovative in securitiz ing duration and credit risk—and in every other way that one can cut and slice risk—and in creating derivatives, too.  My question is whether in your analysis of the private securities flows you see something of a supply-side impact on those flows.  If someone is sitting in another country doing good por tfolio analysis, and the depth, liquidity, and variety of risk exposures they can acquire in U.S. securities is more attractive than the alternatives, is that in and of itself a tradable good that attracts them to the U.S. markets? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I would say it’s not.  The fact of the matter is that most of the securities of at least private corpora tions—not U.S. Treasuries, obviously—that foreigners buy are saying that there aren’t any sales of the type you asked about, but there’s a huge offshore market for corporates in which the securities are denominated in various currencies and the lenders can vary.  And that market is for the most part in London—in Tokyo, too, and to a limited extent in Frankfurt—not New York.  What fo reign buyers of U.S. corporates purchase is a security issued 48 of 203  in their own jurisdiction and in  some sense governed by their ow n jurisdiction’s practices.  So, while I see your point and I’m sure that some pa rt of what you are saying is accurate, it’s not as if these people truly are participating direc tly in the U.S. corporate market.  The U.S. corporations are going overs eas to the euro market.  What is true is that foreign corporations ha ven’t followed those in the United States in choosing to offer corporate tradable securities th at have a range of alte rnatives.  The secondary because of the universal banking tradition that th ey have.  They’ve gone a different way.  It’s true that they might change.  Those corporations  could become more multinational so that their taste for how to finance themselves in different places changes.  If European corporations start to offer a richer mix of high quality corporate debt in their own markets, European or Asian or other non-U.S. investors will see more competition with U.S. bonds and equities, and that could have an effect. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  My other question is for Linda and goes back again to exhibit 7 and is about the pass-through.  One of the changes that inte rnational corporations have made involves replacing trade by going into cu stomer markets—actually putting in facilities and manufacturing in the resident country where the ultimate sale oc curs.  When I look at th e data in exhibit 7, the industry where the pass-through has co me down the most is transport, which I guess is composed primarily of autos and small trucks.  Clear ly, we’ve seen German and Japanese auto manufacturers moving into the United States more  of their production of vehicles destined for this country.  By putting more of their production in the resident country, does that in effect reduce their inherent exposure to foreign exchan ge risk?  Is the amount  that is still being 49 of 203  imported into this country small enough that they don’t need to push it through as they might have done twenty years ago, when all of their U.S sales were being imported?  

[SECTION]

MS. GOLDBERG.  I think that’s certainly a possibility.  When I think about what the import-price response to an exchange rate change  is going to be, I think of the producer who is doing the exporting looking at his own costs and his margins over those costs.  Based on that and the markups in the industry and so forth, he then determines how much he has to change prices.  So that part doesn’t change even if the comp any has facilities in the United States or has diversified the locations of its  production.  There’s another part  to your question about whether production diversification across ma rkets is in part induced by exchange rate volatility, and people really differ in their view of the importan ce of that.  I tend to think that diversification occurs in part because firms want to offset so me of the risk by having the ability to move operations between markets.  So I agree with that, but I don’t know how big that is relative to the total amount of investment and the to tal amount of trade that goes on.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker.  MR. LACKER.  First, let me add to Cathy’s commendations for Joe and Linda and the excellent background papers.  My qu estion relates to Tim’s in a way.  It has to do with the locus of disorderliness.  The prospects for disorderly adjustment seem to motivate and animate a lot of this analysis.  And it strikes me that a lot of the risk regards the rest of the world.  Some of our trading partners have been known to resist the appreciation that accompanies the type of international adjustment that we’re looking at here.  In particular, some developing countries often resort to macroeconomic commitments like exchange rate pegs that they have only a limited ability to follow through on in a consiste nt way.  These commitments are not perfect substitutes for the credibility that comes with deep and resi lient markets and a credible 50 of 203  commitment to low inflation.  It strikes me th at those kinds of commitments by these countries enhance the prospects of  their being susceptible to domes tic macroeconomic instability in response to changes in U.S. macroeconomic cond itions and the type of adjustment that we’re looking at here.  I wonder if you’ve given any thought to that or what your general reactions to that notion are.  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Well, a certain variation of th at theme is to rerun the Asian crisis in one’s head over and over and ask, What if this or  that or the other thing had been different?  Indeed, many people now argue that some of the Asian countries are recreating conditions comparable to those that existed in 1996 and 1997, in  particular the stability that they are trying to achieve in their exchange rates.  Are those ki nds of conditions being recreated?  I think there is a clear risk. Now, it is also true that one of the lessons th at those countries drew from the Asian crisis is that large holdings of reserv es are a good insurance policy.  Al so, they realize that running a current account surplus removes the need to go to the market to finance their activities in any given month, day, or quarter, if conditions get a li ttle adverse.  I think th ey are quite explicitly seeking to build large quantities of  reserves both to impart conf idence to the market, which sees that they have all these wonde rful reserves, and to use if needed—though I would say it’s probably more the former than the latter.  And th ey exhibit a certain bias in the direction of keeping their exchange rate from appreciating in  real terms because that’s what generates the surpluses that protect th em from the need to go to the market.  So they don’t have a large outstanding stock of debt; and, if  anything, they are running down their net debt position and might have positive claims on the rest of the worl d at the rate they are going.  They don’t have a 51 of 203  flow problem, and thus they feel better posit ioned to manage the ups and downs of being globalized into the world’s capital markets.   The problem they face involves the consequenc es for their domestic economies if these strategies ultimately get uncomfortable.  One thing that could happen through the back door is that they may end up with their money supplies growing and they may have domestic inflation; so they get real exchange rate appreciation ev en while they are maintaining nominal exchange rate stability. They may at the same time lesse n the chance to strength en and develop their banking systems and their capital markets because they are constraining prices in the domestic financial system more than is attractive.  So they may be encouraging their private citizens to diversify out of the domestic market, even though  they are trying to reassure those private citizens through the exchange rate stability.  These countries might  be better served in the long run not just to hold on to the resources they are requiring as reserves but to use them to come up with a stronger banking system and more competit ive capital markets.  Ultimately that strategy of trying to achieve exchange ra te stability is not going to prove  to be a long-run winner.  It could be a good adjustment strategy, buying time to accomplish the domestic reforms and to strengthen their financial systems—doing that ca refully over a period of time.  But it does have the capacity to put us back in a world in whic h the emerging-market countries, even successful ones, lack some of the features that the devel oped countries have, partic ularly on the investment side.  So these emerging-market countries are sti ll subject to concerns ab out sudden reversals of capital flows or capital flight from their own resi dents, and those sorts of things.  Indonesia, for example, has had a lot of pressure on its exchange  rate lately—shades of a return to 1997.  It’s a real issue.  And I think it’s one of the reasons that we can finan ce a 5 percent deficit when they 52 of 203  probably can’t and that we can probably finance a 6 or 7 percent deficit when they surely couldn’t.  Does it mean that we can finance a 9 or 10 or 15 percent deficit?  I don’t know.  

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I know it’s ab out time to end this discussion, but I have one more question.  Does it matter what happ ens to the projected fore ign share of the U.S. Treasury market under a scenario where our external imbalance is  substantially larger—maybe getting larger than the increase in the net borro wing requirement of the government?  Is there a point at which you would worry about the implicati ons of these lines going on indefinitely, with a growing foreign share of the outsta nding stock of U.S. risk-free assets? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Within the kinds of numbers we’ve experienced to date we’re inclined to be relatively relaxed about that.  Dino mi ght want to comment on that issue, too, though. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Doesn’t it de pend on the interaction between U.S. Treasury securities and private securities in total? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  You assume  that the preference would change? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  In other word s, if there is literally zero preference difference, then the 50 percent foreign holdings  of U.S. Treasuries is the wrong ratio.  The denominator has to be the aggregat e.  And it’s probably closer to that than not, so that number falls from 50 very significantly. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  You assume th at their preference would change as their share increased? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I think what we’re talking a bout are the preference s of everybody else.  Let’s assume that foreign officials, because of laws written into their books, their regulations, their procedures, or whatever, alwa ys want U.S. sovereigns but th at the vast majority of global 53 of 203  investors regard U.S. sovereigns and U.S. corporate triple-As as perfect substitutes.  Then this tiny group called foreign officials can do whatever they want, and it really doesn’t matter to the pricing of the assets involved. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And if the yield spreads are relatively stable, then the substitutability, for all practi cal purposes, is  without limit. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Now as a taxpayer, Mr. Ch airman, it would probably be churlish to complain that the foreigners ar e buying our debt at high prices. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I agree.  It would be chur lish.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I think there are conseque nces for market liquidity within the Treasury market because some of these foreign pu rchasers do act differently in the primary and secondary markets than private holders.  In particular, there are diffe rences in terms of participating directly in the auction and not putting in competitive bids and in the secondary market not putting the se curities out to lend. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Aren’t these second-order effects generally?  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  This reminds me of the deba te we had when we thought U.S. debt was going to disappear.  While that has consequences , it was not something we regarded as a bad thing because we had surpluses.  So, surely it is manageable.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We started a whol e new discussion!  [Laughter]  Anyway, the clock has run out on us, and I just want to co ngratulate Karen, Joe, and Linda.  It has been a very interesting seminar, which is  really what this has been, and I hope it engages us.  One little thing that went by unnoticed as you were talking about “nature’s” effect or  an exogenous event:  Is Osama bin Ladin part of nature? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Yes.  54 of 203                                                    3 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I say that because  there is a very interesting phenomenon here, in terms of what happens to all of this adjustment process in the event of a significant terrorist attack within the borders of the United States.  That’s a whole different scenario, which we really haven’t addressed in any material wa y, except to presume that, if we can manage a high degree of flexibility in our markets, it will somehow get absorbed.  But how it will be absorbed, I’m not sure we know. In any event, as you are all aware, we have our annual reception at the U.K. Embassy this evening.  Cocktails are at 7:30, and usually we sit down for dinner about a half-hour later.  Transportation has been made available for Boar d members already.  For the Presidents staying at the Watergate, vehicles will be available at your hotel at 7:15.   

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Mr. Chairman, I was wonde ring if there would be enough time for Dino to give his report from the Desk.  That wa y we can start tomorrow with the chart show.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’m sorry.  I didn’t realize that we did have some time.  I think that’s an excellent sugge stion.  Dino, why don’t you get star ted and see if you can finish. MR. KOS.3  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the charts that Carol circulated a short time ago.  I’ll try to proceed quickly.  During the intermeeting period the market’s focus was on the anticipated start of the tig htening cycle.  As shown in the top panel on page 1, three-m onth deposit rates (the black line ) increased near ly 50 basis points and forward rates three, six, and nine months forward (the dashed red lines) rose more than 50 basis points.  The nine-month  forward rate now is above 3 percent.  Treasury yields moved higher.  The middl e panel graphs the two-year yield since since late March to about 2.85 percent, and their spread to the funds rate is at its highest since the spring of 2002.  Much of the focus in markets has been on recent inflation reports, and the short end of the curve has responded.  The long end has not risen as much.  The coupon cu rve, represented by the spread between two-year and ten-year Treasury yields, has flattened to below 190 ba sis points, as shown in the bottom panel.  One thing that market participants have pointed out is that, if expectations were for sharply higher inflation, one would expect to see that curve steepen, but it has not. 55 of 203  Another way to look at infl ationary expectations is th rough the TIPS market, though here the usual health warnings about interpretation of TIPS yi elds and breakevens apply.  As shown in the top panel on page 2, break even yields have tended to rise in recent months as the economic data have improved, oil prices have stayed elevated, and the CPI index has risen.  A noteworthy feature of recent trends is the convergence of breakeven rates between shorter-dated TIPS an d the longer ten-year  TIPS.  One possible interpretation is that infl ationary expectations in th e near term have risen.   While that could be a contributing factor, there are technical factors that may be having a disproportionate effect on these relationships.   TIPS are tied to the not-seasonally-adjusted headline CPI rate, which do es create some interesting dynamics in the pricing of the TIPS themselves.  The recent rise of oil prices has increased investor demand for TIPS because of the anticipated additional inflation accrual on TIPS principal.  This may not reflect expectations for broader inflation to take hold.  A second technical reason is related to the calculation of the inflation accretion; shorter-dated TIPS outperform longer-dated ones during a pe riod when the CPI index is rising.  This will reduce the real yields and, in turn, wi den the breakeven.  Third, the TIPS market is beginning to mature.  Pension and investment  consultants have discovered TIPS and are increasingly viewing them as a separate inve stment class.  The mo vement of funds into TIPS from that source may be exaggeratin g the price movements and lowering real yields for the time being.  We don’t know how much money has been  allocated to this asset class.  But we can look at  what is happening with regard to the dealers.  In the early years of the market, the dealers tended to be long TIPS.  One has to assume this was voluntary on their part and that they found the yield attractive.  This is depicted in the middle panel.  In recent mont hs inventories have been near zero, or net short TIPS, presumably as the real return has become less attractive to this  group of informed agents.    With such technical factors making interpre tation of TIPS difficult, another place to look at is in one-year forward inflation rate s derived from CPI swap s.  CPI swaps are an exchange of fixed for floating payments based on the consum er price index.  As shown in the bottom panel, the forward inflation cu rve has shifted upward—in a largely parallel fashion—by about 25 ba sis points since early  April, which is supportive of the notion that there has not been a disproportionate sh ift in the level of concern about near-term inflation performance.    Looking at fixed-income ma rkets more broadly, there has been a lot of comment about the degree to which positions have been adjusted in advance of the expected tightening.  Or put differently , the issue is, How much of th e carry trade has been closed out?  Unfortunately the data to answer this question are not available, and the information that is available is ambiguous.   The top panel on page 3 graphs primary dealer position data  since May 2003.  Dealers typically are long credit products that are in turn hedged by being short Treasuries.  And typically deal ers, as a group, ar e somewhat net long.  In the past few months, dealers have extended their short Trea sury positions (the dark line), and their 56 of 203  overall positions are close to flat.  This is su ggestive of one key constituency taking steps to reduce risks ahead of an anticipated tightening.  Another perspective is provided by position data made available by the CFTC , which are shown in the middle panel.  While these data have their own definitional problems, they suggest that noncommercial users were going short Treasury futures, presum ably either to hedge other positions or to extend speculative short positions.  This is  also consistent with an unwinding of leverage.  Other bits of evidence are not as definitive.  Bankers suggest that hedge funds are still able to secure very favorable trading terms.  And while individual  hedge funds are less leveraged than they were several years ag o, there are more of  them around and it’s not at all clear that their strategies are so different—notwithstanding assurances from some about the heterogeneity of those strate gies.  In addition, sectors of the fixed-income market where the carry  trade was said to be crow ded have shown only a modest widening of spreads.  As sh own in the bottom left panel, the investment-grade corporate and MBS spreads are somewhat wider, but th e price action does not  suggest large-scale liquidations to date, and anecdotal reports su ggest that banks and hedge funds are still holding on to large positions in mortgage-backed securities.   The bottom right panel graphs the EMBI+ and high-yield spreads.  Interestingly, spreads—after widening around the time of the last FOMC meeting and after some negative news out of Brazil— have narrowed to below 400 basis points for high-yield instruments and to below 500 basis points for the EMBI.  There are certainly some fundamental explanations for th e recent narrowing:  improved corporate outlooks, lower oil prices in recent weeks, and some improved emerging-m arket news.  But none of these developments in and of  themselves suggests that the leveraged trades have necessarily been liquidated.    Price action in foreign exchan ge markets has had traders scratching their heads.  The top panel on page 4 shows the dollar’s mo vements since April 1 against a few major currencies—but this time not including the Ne w Zealand dollar!  [Laughter]  Despite the sharp movements of interest rates since earl y April and the shift in expectations, the dollar has barely moved;  and since the last FO MC meeting it has tended to fa ll.  Foreign exchange traders have taken that as a bearish sign, which suggests to them that the dollar will fall once the tightening cycle actually begins.  Severa l have noted that the dollar fell from about 1.75 to 1. 50 against the DM duri ng the 1994 tightening cycle.  Japanese has brightened.  The yen has be en under modest upward pressu re again, and some in the if the yen continues to face up ward pressure.  The middle left panel shows the recent rise in the ten-year JGB yield.  The rise in yields  has been generalized across the curve.  As can be seen in the middle ri ght panel, which depicts the Japanese yield curve as of yesterday and as of roughly a year ago, the entir e yield curve is sharply higher and steeper.  While the authorities ha ve been talking yi elds down the past few days, many in the market are begi nning to think about the Bank of Japan’s tran sition back to a more normal operating structure.  In  Europe, the data have tended  to be mixed and somewhat disappointing given growth in other regions.  Reflecting this diverg ence of performance, 57 of 203  yields there have risen only slightly and not as much as compar able U.S. yields—as shown in the bottom panel.    Turning to page 5, I’d like to spend a few minutes updating th e Committee on the reduced volatility in the fed funds market that we have observed in recent year s.  The type of rate volatility I will be describing is very shor t term:  intrad ay standard deviations of the funds rate ar ound the daily effective rate and the deviation of the daily effective rate from the funds target.  The top panel on page  5 graphs the annual average standard deviation of the funds rate around th e effective rate in blue and gives the annual median in red.  In general, the standard deviation of the funds ra te measured by the annual average was in a range of between 15 and 25 basis points until 19 99, and it was somewhat less than that using the median.  The spik es in the early 1990s were linked to a variety of factors, such as financial problems in the banking  system that created tiering and the elimination of reserv e requirements on nontransactio n and Eurodollar  deposits.  The decline in volatility began in earnest in 1999 and has been maintain ed in subsequent years—with some notable excep tions such as September 11, 2001, and the days after.  The bottom panel takes the same data and pres ents them in a different way; it depicts the medians of rolling ten-day periods of daily standard deviatio ns of the fed funds rate.  This graph shows the regular spikes associated with the year-end, which have now all but disappeared, as well as the somewhat  higher volatilities in the fall of 1998.   Page 6 takes a different perspective by looking at the absolute deviations, expressed in basis points, from the fed funds target.  Th is measure suggests th at most trading is increasingly very near the targ et, with very little de viation.  The precis e reasons for this notable decline in vol atility are not clear and my colleagues at the New York Fed are doing some research  on this question.  No  single explanatio n by itself is compelling, but some combination of the follow ing probably would get us most of the way there.  First, among technical factors, was th e shift to lagged reserve requirements in 1998 that helped make reserve demand more pr edictable both for the banks and the Desk.  Second, the Desk expanded the number of banks from which it collects daily reserve position data—also to help it better es timate reserve demand.  Third, banks have developed better internal control and information systems for managing their reserve positions.  And fourth, at the margin, the Desk is probably intervening more often now than it did in the late ’80s or early ’90s, given the explicit rate target ing regime—though this does not explain the continue d decline in vola tility since 2000.  But the lurch downward in observed volatility is  hard to explai n with technical factors alone.  Two other factors that probabl y played a role are th e lower absolute value of interest rates and the intro duction of the primary credit f acility.  Lower rates directly limit the absolute amoun t by which rates could decline; so  with the target at 1 percent, the scope of deviation on the do wnside is only 100 basis points at present.  Indirectly, low rates have lifted reserve requirements (b y boosting growth in tr ansactions deposits) and have created more room for banks to increa se their clearing balance requirements consistent with their use of priced services.  And possibl y the experience with much lower volatility has affected market expectatio ns to the point that the trend has become self-reinforcing. 58 of 203  The impact of the primary credit  facility is hard to assess at present.  It has limited the extent of upward spikes in rates on individual days, as shown on page 7.  But since we saw few occasions when rates reached clos e to 100 basis points above the target in the year or so preceding the creation of the new facility, it’s too early to c onclude that the facility’s creation has been  a major factor in explai ning the redu ced level of volatility.  At some poi nt the impact of lowe r rates, including th e impact on reserve requirements, will be reversed.  When this  happens there will be so me increase in rate volatility.  But many of the other factors mentioned pe rsist, so even if volatility increases, there are reasons to ex pect that it will not rise agai n to the levels we saw in the 1990s.  Two wild cards that could affect this picture include the possibility that the Congress will permit the Fed to pay interest on reserves and, sec ond, the ways in which the new daylight overdraft rules for GSE payments of principa l and interest are implemented.  Either of thes e has the potential to have a major impact on fed funds volatility trends in the future.   Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations  in this period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I haven’t looked at  the primary dealer data system in recent years, but the net outright positions, as you  point out, have essentially come down to zero from a significant plus.  What are the missing it ems in the balance sheet that account for the difference? MR. KOS.  I’m not sure I fu lly understand your question.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, on the asset side, the primary dealers have positions, long and short.  There is a net position with a value.   What is on the liabil ity side for capital?  MR. KOS.  What we try to do is to look at th e position data to see what the longs and the shorts are, excluding certain things such as TIPS, bills, and discount notes.  That basically gives us a sense of what securities are there.  No w, there will be a big repo book on both sides of the balance sheet, so those have been subtracted as we ll.  So this is one way of giving a picture of the position—  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The tradable positions.  59 of 203  MR. KOS.  Yes, without cluttering it up with a matched book, which would tend to balloon the balance sheet.  That would tell us something about th e financing, how this on net is being financed.  But the matched book operation is its own business—  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And you don’t have th e derivative positions net in this at all?  MR. KOS.  That’s right.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  One other thing.  On the chart showing Japanese three-month to thirty-year government yields, are these the absolute values and the actual yields?  These are not the yields of the one-year maturity ten years out? MR. KOS.  No, these would be the actual yields.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  They are the actual yields.  That leads me to conclude in looking at the ten-year, twenty-y ear and thirty-year yields th at the more implicit one-year maturity ten years out is yieldi ng very significantly above these num bers.  What is that yield, do you know offhand?  MR. KOS.  I don’t.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In our case, we’v e got 6½ plus percent, and this doesn’t look all that different. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHER.  Th is goes to thirty years. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I know, but look at th e ten-year.  It’s the rate of change in the yield curve.  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  There’s a risk premium in that as well as an expectation.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I would hope so.  [Laughter]  Questions for Dino?  You traumatized everybody! 60 of 203

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objectio n they are approved.  We will adjourn until tomorrow morning.  Is anyone not coming toni ght to the dinner?  Good, I’m glad everyone will be attending.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good morning everyone .  Mr. Oliner, would you start us off? 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.4  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We ha ve received a lot of information about economic activity since th e April FOMC meeting.  Focu sing first on the data in hand when we closed the Greenbook, the to p left panel shows th at labor demand has clearly strengthened.  Private payrolls incr eased at an average pace of 300,000 per month in April and May, build ing on the improvement in th e first quarter.  These gains were broadly based and included an upt urn in the manufacturing sector that accompanied a surge in factory output.  As shown to the right, manufact uring IP rose at an average annual rate of ne arly 9 percent in April and May, up from the already brisk 6 percent pace in the previous two quarters.  Despite the rapid ri se in goods output, inventory–sales ratios (the middle left panel)  have moved sharply lower outside the auto sector, and we anticipat e that stockbuilding will graduall y pick up, adding support to production in coming months.  In addition, housing activity has been  stronger than we anticipated.  As shown to the right, starts of single-family homes remained elevated in  However, the key data released after we finished the Greenbook  have been softer than we expected.  After fold ing in the new data on consumer spending, we now project that real PCE, shown in the bottom left pane l, rose at a 2½ percent rate this quarter, down from the 3½ percent p ace in the Gr eenbook.  No doubt, some of the recent weakness in spending reflects the hit to real income from the larger-than-expected rise in consumer prices of late.  After the Greenbook closed, we also received new data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital good s.  As shown to the right, both series dipped in May, indicating slig htly less robust demand for business equipment than we had anticipated.   Taking this new information on  board, the table in your next exhibit shows that we currently estimate real GDP (line 1) to have increased at a 4¼ percent rate this quarter, ½ percentage point below th e Greenbook forecast.  Combined with the downward revision to first-quarter GDP in  BEA’s latest estimate , growth in the first half of the year now appears to have been less vigorous than we had thought, and we  have marked down the second-half forecast a bit as  well.  Nonetheless, the basi c contour of our projection is little changed from the Greenbook .  We continue to  project that GDP growth will move up in the second half of the year—on the strength of fast er increases in consumer spending and some inventory restocking—befo re dropping back to about 3½ percent next year as monetary po licy becomes less accommodat ive and fiscal policy turns slightly contractionary.  With real GDP increasing a little faster than potential over the forecast period, we project that the unemploym ent rate (line 3) will drift down to about 5¼ percent by the end of 2005.   David will discuss our outlook for inflation in a few minutes.  At  this point I would simply note that the price data released since the Greenbook c ontained some further 62 of 203  upward surprises, and we now project that th e core PCE price index (line 5) will rise 2 percent this year and 1.6 percent next year.      In light of the less favora ble news on inflation that we received since your last meeting, we have incorporated a greater degree of policy tightening in the current forecast.  As shown in  the middle left panel, we assu me that the federal funds rate reaches 3 percent by the fourth quarter of next year, compar ed with 2¼ percent in the have shifted up our assumed path for crude oi l prices by roughly $3 per barrel, in line with the revision in futures prices.  Moving to the right, equity pric es were a tad weaker than we had expected over the intermee ting period, prompting a small downward adjustment in the path going forward.  Taken together, these revision s to interest rates, oil prices, and stock prices sh aved a few tenths from our projection of GDP growth for 2005.   Your next exhibit reviews the current stat e of asset valuations, beginning with the equity market.  The top left panel plots the forward earning s–price ratio for the S&P 500 (the red line) and the real yi eld on long-term Treasuries (the black line).  The gap between the two series reflects the combined effect of the equity risk premium and the market’s outlook for earnings growth.  This  gap has changed little over the past few years, holding at a level around the average in the first half of  the 1990s.  By this metric, stocks appear to be reasonably priced.  We be lieve the same is true for corporate bonds.  The shaded area in the panel to the right show s our estimate of the risk premium in the high-yield bond market, which we calculat e as the difference between the observed high-yield spread over Treasuries (the red line) and the part of  that spread that compensates for expected future  defaults (the black line).  Although the implied risk premium has come down a lot from its peak in 2002, it re mains well within the range typically observed during period s of economic expansion.   The valuation picture for housi ng appears somewhat less sa nguine.  As shown in the middle left panel, prices of existing homes ha ve risen 7 to 8 percent annually for the past several years.  Meanwhile, ho using rents have increased mu ch less, which has caused a steep decline in the ratio of rents to prices, the analogue to  the earnings–price ratio for equities.  The panel to the right plots the rent–price ratio against the same long-run Treasury yield that we used to assess equity  valuations.  Note that the rent–price ratio can be calculated only as an index number, so it s absolute level cannot be compared with the level of the Treasury yield; nonethel ess, changes in the re lative position of the two series over time shed light  on valuations vis-à-vis hist orical norms.  Currently, the rent–price ratio is very low re lative to the Treasury yield, suggesting that valuations are rich.  Accordingly, we anticipate that the ga ins in home prices will sl ow sharply over the forecast period; for 20 05, we have penciled in an incr ease of only 2½ percent, which would be the smallest annual rise in a decade.   63 of 203  The bottom panels present sim ilar data for commercial real  estate.  As shown in the left panel, prices for these as sets have risen slowly, on average, over the past three years, reflecting the soft demand for commercial space.  The net operating income from these properties has been even weak er, falling about 4 percent in 2002 and 5½ percent last year.  As a result, the ratio of net operating in come to price, shown by the red line in the right panel, has plummeted over the past few years, which has compressed the spread over the long-run Treasury yield.  Currently, this spread is narrower than it has been for more than a decade but is still wider than it wa s throughout the 1980s.   At this point, we don’t think commercial valuations are as stretched as those for housing, but the situation bears watching, and we anticipat e only small increase s in commercial real estate prices over the forecast period.     The top left panel of your next exhibit s hows the implications of  this analysis for household wealth positions.  As  you can see, we project that the ratio of net worth to income will edge off a bit ov er the forecast period, as the subdued rise in real estate prices holds down the gain in net worth.  However, this anticipated downdrift offsets only part of the increase in the wealth-to-in come ratio since the mi ddle of 2002.  Taking account of the lagged resp onse of spending to changes in net worth,  we expect wealth effects to make a small positive contribution to real PCE growth this year and to be about neutral in 2005.    The key factor shaping our outlook for consumer spendi ng is the path for real disposable income.  As shown by the blue bars in the right panel, we expect real DPI to rise at a pace of more than 4 percent over the fo recast period, reflec ting a combination of sizable employment gains and increases in r eal compensation per hour.  Our projection for real spending growth (the  red bars) is slightly below that for real income, as we expect the saving rate to move up toward its longer-run target le vel over the forecast period.  In the housing market , higher mortgage rates are expected to damp activity, causing residential investment (shown in the middle left panel) to post a small decline next year.   Some commentators have expressed concern that a firming of monetary policy will dramatically raise interest payment burdens for households .  We believe that such concerns are overblown, in large part beca use most household debt carries a fixed interest rate, which slow s the adjustment of interest costs to rising short-term rates.  The middle right panel illustrates this point for mortgage debt.  The black line shows the thirty-year fixed mortgage ra te, while the red line displays  the average rate on the outstanding stock of fixed-rate mortgages.  As shown, the polic y tightening from mid-1999 to mid-2000 boosted the thirty-year mortga ge rate more than 150 basis points, but the average rate on the stock of debt barely budged.  We expect a similar pattern to hold over the forecast period.  To be sure, intere st rates on adjustable  rate mortgages will move up, but even for these lo ans, the average rate will rise gr adually because many ARMs start off with a fixed rate for several year s.  The bottom le ft panel shows the staff =s broadest measure of household financ ial obligations, defined as the sum of required principal and interest payments, au to lease payments, an d rent payments, all scaled by disposable income.  As shown, this ratio has co me down from its peak, largely 64 of 203  reflecting the wave of mortgage  refinancing that reduced th e average interest rate on mortgage debt.  Going forward,  we expect the rati o to remain about steady, as the slow rise in the average interest ra te on outstanding debt  is offset by some  further substitution of mortgages for higher-cost types of debt.  Our relatively upbeat view about household financial conditions seems to be shared by ma rket participants.  On e indicator, shown in the bottom right panel, is the interest rate spread on securities backed by credit card receivables; this spread has narrowed quite a bit over the past few years.   In the business sector, the subject of your next exhibit, all signs point to healthy financial conditions.  As  shown in the top left  panel, firms have c ontinued to deleverage, reducing the debt-to-asset ratio  for nonfinancial corporatio ns (the black line) to the lowest level in many years.  With the lighter debt load, the share of cash flow devoted to meeting interest expenses (the red line) has fallen dramatically as well.  Reflecting this improvement in financia l ratios, the delinquency rate on C&I loans at  banks (the red line to the right) has retraced much  of the run-up from  1998 to 200 2, and the default rate on corporate bonds (the black line) ha s dropped even more sharply.   Some analysts believe that businesses—like households—will suffer significant financial pain from a rise in short-term interest ra tes.  The middle le ft panel presents a key part of the argument against that view.  The black lin e shows an estimate of the interest rate that corporations face on ne w debt, calculated as a weighted average of bond yields and bank loan rates.  This rate jumped during the tight ening episodes that began in 1994 and 19 99 and has plummeted in recent years.  However, the average interest rate that firms pay on their stock of debt (the red line) has been far more stable.  In particular, this average ra te increased only about ½ perc entage point during each of the two tightening cycles.  More recently, the average interest ra te has held steady despite the drop in the cost of new debt.  Th is unusual pattern largely reflects the fact that the latest downsw ing in borrowing costs was driven by shrinking  credit spreads on corporate bonds rather than by  declining short-term  rates.  The redu ced spreads had no direct effect on interest costs for the large volume of fixed -rate debt sitti ng on firms’ balance sheets.   The financial health of the business sector  ultimately depends on its capacity to generate profits.  As shown to  the right, the profit share of  GNP now stands at its highest level in more than three decad es.  Although we expect earnin gs to soften somewhat over our forecast period, the profit share should rema in quite high by hist orical standards.  Thus, firms have the wherewithal to support solid increases in  capital outlays, and the caution that had been holding down spending now appears to have fa ded, as illustrated in the bottom left panel.  This panel plots the well-known relationship between the acceleration in business output and the grow th in real outlays  for equipment and software.  The line drawn through the dots shows the fitte d relationship fo r the period from 1985 through 2000.  As  indicated by the red dots below the line, E&S spending was exceptionally weak during 2001 and remained soft in 20 02 and 2003.  However, the strong gains recorded so  far this year sugges t that 2004 will end up above the fitted line, and we expect the same to be true in 2 005.  The table to the right summarizes our forecast for total business fixe d investment.  As shown, we pr oject that total BFI (line 1) 65 of 203  will expand 12 percent in real terms this ye ar and another 9 percent next year.  This contour reflects the pattern for spending on  equipment and software (line 2), which we expect to be boosted this year by the partia l-expensing tax benefit that expires at year-end, after which spending hits a temporary pothole.  For nonres idential construction (line 3), we expect a gradual upturn in activity this year, which sh ould strengthen in 2005 as the sizable amount of v acant space gets worked down .  David will now continue our presentation.   

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Chart 6 presents the broa d contours of our outlook for the labor the unusual caution of the past few years, they will continue to add significantly to their payrolls, partly to relieve some of the pressu res on workforces that  currently appear to be a bit overstretched.  On our estimates, monthly increases in nonfarm payrolls will average a little more th an 300,000 jobs throug h the end of this year  before tapering off next year.  As shown in the top right panel, one im plication of relieving  pressure on the workforce is that productivity  is likely to come back into  closer alignm ent with its structural trend.  A consequence of the la st few months’ worth of data is that the discrepancy between the level of private employment reported in the establishment and household surveys, as shown in  the middle left panel, has largely closed.  For reasons that are not fully understood, the establishment surv ey tends to rise mo re on the upswing of the business cycle and to so ften more in the down phase.   Nonetheless, having come full cycle, so to speak , since 1994, the two measures ar e in close alignment, at least momentarily.  Even with a robust pace of hiring, we ha ve the unemployment rate (the middle right panel) remaining slightly above our estimate of the NAIRU throughout the projection period, for two key reasons:  Firs t, as shown in the bot tom left panel, we expect that, as job opportunitie s continue to open up, the labor force participation rate will move most of the way ba ck toward its long-term averag e.  Second, we expect that the workweek (the botto m right panel) will continue its cyclical rebo und.  If either of these developments were to fa il to materialize, pressures on labor resources could be more intense than we have assu med in the baseline.  I will come back to this risk shortly.  Your next chart turns to  the issue of inflation.   As illustrated in th e top left panel, and as you are all well aware, PCE price inflation has stepped up this year from the very low rates registered last year, both for the overall index (the black line) and for the core (the red line).  In recent months, the overall inde x—shown in the first co lumn of the table to the right—has been rising more  quickly, on average,  than the core, reflecting the direct contributions from food and es pecially energy.  The middle left panel decomposes core PCE inflation, and highlights that  the  largest part of the pi ckup in core PCE inflation during the first half of this year relative to the comparab le period last year reflects the development on line 3, namely faster inflat ion in the prices of goods other than motor vehicles.  As shown on line 2, firmer prices  of motor vehicles also have contributed to the acceleration this year, as have the prices of n onmarket-based services (line 6), most notably the imputed price of banking services.  The panel to the right take s a step away from pure ar ithmetic and attempts to attribute the acceleration in the core index to some underlying causes .  According to our 66 of 203  models, some of the pickup in co re inflation this year can be  attributed to  the indirect effects of higher energy prices.  Anothe r chunk, according to the models, can be attributed to the acceleration of import prices, an attribution that seems consistent with sizable contribution of goods prices shown in the left-hand panel.  The remainder of the pickup, shown on line 3, likely reflects the in fluence of a slowly narrowing margin of slack and perhaps a diminishing productivit y dividend, as well as the aforementioned larger contribution from nonmarket-based servic es and a variety of other factors not well captured by our models.  As shown in the bot tom left panel, commod ity prices escalated sharply through the early months of this ye ar but have retreated somewhat in recent weeks.  We expect the pass- through of higher production costs already in train to continue to boost core consumer price infl ation through much of this year, before beginning to reverse course ar ound year-end.  As shown to the right, near-term inflation expectations, which tend to react to recent  trends in overall consumer prices, have stepped up noticeably in  the last few months.  Even so , longer-term expectations, shown by the red line, thus far seem to have remained reasonably  well anchored.   Despite the recent upside surp rises on the inflation front , our forecast continues to anticipate that inflationary pr essures will remain fairly we ll contained; chart 8 lays out some of our thinking as to wh y this is so.  As shown on li ne 1 of the table, we expect overall PCE inflation over the next six quarters to run at a pace of ab out 1¼ percent.  In part, this reflects, as shown on line 3 and in the middle left panel, a partial unwinding of the substantial run-up in energy  prices last year and this.  And as shown on line 5 and in the middle right panel, we expect food pric e inflation to moderate , as farmers step up their production in response to recent high  prices.  Moreover, we expect core PCE inflation to edge back from its upswing in the first half of this year.  A number of factors combine to keep a lid on  core inflation in our projection:  a persistent, albeit narrowing, expectations; and the pass-through of the more moderate turn of energy and import prices into core inflation.  That said, as Yo gi Berra once remarked, “it’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.”  With that in mind, the bottom right panel shows 70 percent and 90 percent confidence intervals around  our baseline forecast.  As you can see, the 70 percent interval around our forecast for infl ation in 2005 extends from ¾ percent on the low side to nearly 2½ percent on the high side, and the 90 percent interval is correspondingly wider.  One source of uncertainty in the outlook  that has garnered a great deal of commentary lately is the gap in resource utili zation.  Chart 9 turns to this topic.  The basic idea of this chart is to compare our benchmark meas ure of the gap—the difference between our estimate of the NAIRU and th e actual unemployment rate—with a number of alternative indicators of th e pressures on productive resour ces.  In every panel, the unemployment gap is plot ted as the red line.  For ease of plotting, a ll series in the chart are standardized to have ze ro mean and standard deviat ion equal to 1, and all are normalized so that high values indicate relatively intense pres sures on productive resources.  The top two panels compare the unemployment gap with two alternative measures from the labor mark et.  In the panel on the le ft, the black line shows the employment-to-population ratio.  In the pa nel on the right, th e black line shows the 67 of 203  Conference Board’s measure of whether survey  respondents think that  jobs are easy or hard to get.  These alterna tive measures from the labor ma rket track the contour of the unemployment gap very closely.  Moreover, th e latest readings on all three series are right in line with the values th at they registered in 1994—a time when labo r still seemed underutilized.  The middle panels compare the unemployment gap with two alternative measures of capacity utilization—the one  on the left being the index pr oduced here at the Board, and the one on the right being the measure published by the Institute for Supply Management.  As we have noted on a nu mber of occasions, the FRB series has, for some time, b een signaling considerable remainin g slack in utilization rates in the manufacturing sector.  By contrast, the mo st recent reading on the ISM’s index of capacity utilization seems to in dicate much tig hter condition s.  We believe, however, that this apparent tension refl ects the fact that the ISM is measuring a different concept than we are.  In particular, in responding to the ISM survey, firms appear to take account of the current availability—or lack thereof—of labor and materials.  Accordingly, the ISM series reflects short-term production bottlenecks.  In co ntrast, we ask respondents to focus on their maximum sustai nable production given the capi tal in place and to assume the availability of sufficie nt labor and materials.   The bottom left panel comp ares the unemployment gap with the output gap, and demonstrates that we continue to rely on the regularity of th is relationship to inform our assumption for the growth of  potential GDP.  Indeed, the re cent—albeit small—errors in Okun’s law were one factor in our reassessmen t of the current level of the output gap in this forecast.  The pa nel on the bottom right of the page steps outside th e realm of gaps and presents the Chicag o Federal Reserve Bank’s National  Activity Index.  Despite the fact that this series is an i ndicator of growth rath er than the gap in re source utilization, I present it here because Stock and Watson and some others have reported that it outperforms the unemployment ga p as a forecaster of inflatio n, though we have not met with as much success.  Clear ly, though, the recent signals from the NAI have been much hotter than the ones from the unemployment ga p.  The messages that  I take away from this chart are, first, that the bulk of the evidence sugg ests that some slack—even if only a relatively slim amount—remain s in the utilization of pro ductive resources.  Second, not all plausible indicators sing in unison on this qu estion, and we have to be open to the possibility that actual pr essures are quite different from those that  we have assumed in the baseline forecast.  In other words, we ar e uncertain about our es timate of the gap in resource utilization.  Chart 10 examines the impli cations of that uncertainty for the inflation outlook, and places “gap” uncertainty in perspective by  comparing it with two other important sources of uncertainty.  Before delving into th e specifics of this chart, let me sketch the general approach.  The idea of  this chart is to  decompose the Gree nbook confidence intervals that I showed earlier to give you a rough idea of where that uncertainty might be coming from.  For a variet y of technical reasons, the decomposition here is partial, not exhaustive, and most assuredly is less precise than it appear s on this chart.  68 of 203  Nonetheless, at least in broad strokes, we think it represents  a reasonable first approximation.   The top pair of panels consid ers the implications of uncerta inty pertaining to the gap in resource utilization.  Specifically, as outline d in the bullets in th e top left panel, we consider a confidence interval  of plus or minus ½ percentage point around our baseline NAIRU assumption, which we believe should encompass about two-thirds of the probability mass.  Then, as no ted in the second bullet, we layer on top of that the assumption of some coefficien t uncertainty, equivale nt to a plus or minus one standard error band around the slope co efficient translating a give n unemployment gap into its implications for future infl ation.  As noted in the th ird bullet, we refer to the combination of NAIRU uncertain ty and coefficient uncertain ty as “resource utilization uncertainty.”  The last ste p, then, is to have FRB/US tell us how important resource utilization uncertainty might be in generating uncertainty in the outlook for inflation.  The result of that exercise is  plotted in the top right pane l as the innermost cone, which is shaded red.  To put that uncertainty in perspective, I’ve plotted it against the same Greenbook confidence intervals that I showed you earlier.   The middle panels consider the implications of our uncertainty about energy prices.  Again, two forms of uncertainty are considered—uncertainty about the prices themselves and uncertainty about the pass-through into core  price inflation.   The striking result here is that energy pr ice uncertainty is an even great er source of uncertainty about the outlook for inflation than is resource utilization uncertainty, according to FRB/US.  Similarly, the bottom pair of panels consider s the implications of our uncertainty about import prices.  And once again, the results from the model indicate that we should be at least as concerned about this source of uncertainty  as we are about uncertainty generated by the gap in resour ce utilization.   In sum, uncertainty about re source utilization is certai nly not the only important source of uncertainty about infl ation over the next year or two, and it may not even be the most important one.  In part, this conclusion stems fr om the fact that we believe the pass-through coefficient from  changes in the unemployment gap to inflation is pretty small.  As well, it reflects the fact that the m odel thinks it knows th at coefficient to within plus or minus 30 percent or so.  That combination of circumstances implies that resource utilization uncertainty will have only limited implications for inflation uncertainty.  On the other hand, energy prices  move a great deal, an d so can leave a big imprint on core inflation even with only a small pass-through coefficient.   Your next chart takes a different approach  to exploring uncertainty and summarizes two scenarios from the Greenbook illustrating upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook.  These are the same two scenarios discussed in th e Board briefing on Monday.  In the first scenario, as you will recall from  the Greenbook, we co nsider the possibility that we are too optimistic about the suppl y side of the economy.  Specifically, we suppose that the NAIR U is 5¾ percent rather than 5 percent as in the baseline projection, and we assume that  the bounceback in the partic ipation rate th at I showed you a few charts earlier will be only half as large.  In addition, we al low long-term 69 of 203  inflation expectations to gradually rise 1 perc entage point relative to baseline over the forecast period.  As shown by  the dashed red line in the panel to the right, these assumptions generate a marked ly worse inflation outcome, assuming a fixed nominal funds rate, with four-quarter core PCE inflation ri sing to about 2½ percent by the end of next year.   That said, we believe the in flation projection that we pu t forward in the Greenbook has the risks well balanced on  both sides.  One of the do wnside risks that we see is illustrated in the middle panel,  which shows the mark up of price over unit labor costs.  The most recent readings on this  variable have been the high est since at least the end of the Second World War.  And while our projection calls for the deviation of the markup from its long-run average to narrow, it certainly could narrow by more and at a faster pace.  In particular, in the course of ra mping up produc tion, firms may bid up wages faster than in the baseline.  At the same time, competitive pressures may be so strong that they more than offset the price effects of higher unit labor costs.  In the alternative scenario, we assumed th at the markup moves halfway back  to its long-term average.  And as shown by the dashed red line in th e bottom right panel, th e downward pressure on inflation of even a partial return along those lines over the next six quarters could be quite powerful.  Nathan  Sheets will now contin ue our presentation.

 MR. SHEETS.  Your first international chart focuse s on developments in international financial markets.   As shown in the top left panel, yields on long-term government bonds in the major industrial countries have move d up over the past several months, in line with mountin g evidence of global recove ry and prospective monetary tightening in some countries.  The rise in U.S. bond yields has been particularly marked, and Japanese rates have risen to their highest  levels since late 2000.  Rates implied by three-month Eurocurrency futures contracts, shown on the top right, have also shifted up—most noticeably for the dollar and for ster ling but to some exte nt for the euro and the yen as well.  These moves in long-ter m and expected short- term interest rate differentials have provided some support for the dollar.  As seen  in the bottom left panel, the broad trade-weighted dollar has strengthe ned a bit since January, as the dollar has posted gains against the euro and the yen.  As displayed on the bottom right, equity  markets have trea ded water in most industrial countries since late January, wi th improving growth prospects and rising interest rates having broadly countervailing effects.  Japan ha s been a notable exception, however.  Equity prices there have pow ered ahead, supporte d by the economy’s remarkably strong recent perf ormance.  As shown in the top left panel of your next chart, we estimate that Japane se growth (line 1) hummed alon g at a 5 percent rate during the first half, as the rebound that began last year has conti nued to broaden.  We expect growth in Japan to moderate through the forecast period, to around 2½ percent.  Growth in China (line 2) is also e xpected to moderate from its recent sizzling pace, as the authorities there seek to engineer  a “soft landing.”  As shown in lines 4 and 5, during the first half of this year, growth  in Germany has trailed even the sluggish recovery posted by other euro-area countries, and we see Germ an growth continuing  to lag through the forecast period.  70 of 203  All told, we expect foreign growth (line 8) to proceed at a solid 3½ percent pace through the rest of this year and next.  As  noted on the top right , a sustained global recovery is now under way.  The deflationary  risks that plagued the foreign outlook a year or so ago have generally abated, but  inflation is also likely to remain well contained.  In short, our baseline forecas t expects the foreign ec onomies to put in a favorable performance.  Nevertheless, new ri sks have emerged.  First, amid intense geopolitical uncertainty , oil prices have rece ntly been high and volatile, and this may threaten price stability and grow th in some countries.  Second , rising interest rates and tightening global liquidity cond itions may pose risks for em erging-market economies or heavily indebted sectors in th e industrial countries.  Third, the po ssibility of a hard landing in China carries significant risks fo r other Asian economies (including Japan) and, perhaps, for the rest of the world as well.   The remainder of my remarks examine several of these issu es in greater detail.  I turn first to the recent performance of th e Japanese economy.  As  shown on the middle left, Japanese exports have grown rapidly ove r the past couple of ye ars, as exports to China and other emerging Asian economies have surged, and ma nufacturing profits have rebounded in lock-step with exports.  More recentl y, nonmanufacturing profits have risen as well—to the highest rate in a decade—suggesting that the recovery is expanding across sectors.  Rising profitability along with improvin g conditions in the corporate sector more generally have allowed investment (the black line on the middle right) to rebound from its recent trough.  Labor markets have also revived, with the offers-to-applicants ratio rising sharpl y and the unemployment rate (not shown) these positive developments, it should be kept in mind that Japan has experienced false dawns before—in 1996 and again in 1999-2000.  Moreover, as shown on the bottom left, Japanese consumption has inched ahea d over the past decade, outpacing advances in employee compensation (the dotted blue line ).  The result has b een a marked decline in the household saving rate (in red).  We expect the saving rate to  move up as economic conditions improve.  If  this happens abruptly , consumption mi ght lag the recovery even if compensation begins to rise.  The bo ttom right panel highlights two long-standing sources of stress within the Japanese econom y.  First, although r eal estate prices in certain parts of Tokyo have stabilized or even begun to rise, the decline in broad measures of urban land prices has not abat ed.  Second, bank credit has continued to contract.  The top panels of your next  chart focus on the sustai ned economic weakness of Germany relative to other euro-area countries .  As shown on the left, over the past year, while per capita consumption in the rest of the euro area has expanded nearly twice as fast.  Germany’s lagging performance is due to a number of  factors, but t he inflexibility of the country =s labor markets—and the resulti ng inability to  create new jobs—has played a key role .  As shown on the right, German employment has been essentially flat over th e past decade in the face of an  unemployment rate  currently above 10 percent.  The fact that other euro-area economies—hardly post er children for labor 71 of 203  potential benefits of ev en incremental progress toward labor market reform.  However, the political support in Germany for such reform is limited and, if anything, has diminished of late.    As shown in the middle left panel, four -quarter inflation ra tes in a number of countries have stepped up during the second  quarter, as the pri ces of oil and other commodities have approach ed or exceeded ten-year highs.  Inflation in the euro area (line 2) has recently moved above the ECB =s 2 percent ceiling.  Inflation in the United Kingdom (line 4) has in creased as well but rema ins below the government =s 2 percent target.  Even so, the Bank of England has tightened policy 100 basis points since early will stoke inflationary pressures.  As shown in line 6, Chinese infl ation moved up during the second quarter, largely reflecting a double-digit rise in food prices.   Average foreign inflation sh ould remain around 2½ per cent through the second half of this year and then decline to just over 2 percent next year.  Our forecast for lower inflation next year is conditio ned on the expectation that oil prices (shown on the bottom left) will move some what lower, as is now embedde d in futures pr ices.  Nonfuel commodity prices are li kewise projected to moderate th rough the forecas t period.  As shown in the bottom right panel, the prices of several key commodities have already retreated from their recent highs.  In additi on, foreign central banks are committed to keeping inflation in check.  W ith recoveries abroad becoming  firmly entrenched, we see the ECB and the Bank of Canada as likely to start raising rates late this year or early next year, and the Bank of E ngland will continue its gradual tightening.  As  shown in the middle right panel, deflation in Japan—as me asured by the CPI—ap pears to be ebbing, and our forecast calls for sligh tly positive CPI infl ation going forward.  In contrast, the Japanese PCE deflator has recorded steady d eclines.  We expect the BOJ to leave its policy of quantitative easing in  place through the forecast period until there is clear evidence that deflationary  pressures ha ve abated.   The top panels of your next chart pr esent data on corporate and household indebtedness.  If borrowers have gorged themselves on cheap de bt during the recent period of low interest rates,  they may find it di fficult to service or roll over their increased debt burdens as interest rates move  higher.  As shown on the left, Japanese firms have aggressively paid down debt and st rengthened their balance sheets in recent years, while the indebtedness of euro-area firms has remain ed about constant since the ECB began easing policy in May 2001.  Corporate debt levels in the Un ited Kingdom have climbed during the past few years, as ba nk borrowing by the real  estate sector has risen sharply, but such borrowing by manufacturing firms has actually declined.  Data on household indebtedness  (shown in the top right panel) indicate that the debt levels of Japanese consumers have been about fl at in recent years.  In contrast, the debt burdens of U.K. households have increase d significantly, driven largely by rising mortgage debt in line with the red-hot real estate market.  As such, the assets of these households have risen along with  their indebtedness.  As mo st mortgages in the United Kingdom are variable rate and are directly linked to the Ba nk of England’ s policy rate, 72 of 203  the recent monetary tightening has translated in to higher debt-service burdens.  To date, however, households have absorbed the tight ening of policy with fe w signs of strain.  Household indebtedness in the euro area has also risen somewhat during the past few years, as mortgage debt in some euro-area countries has po sted considerable increases.  This discussion suggests  that interest rate vulnerabilitie s in the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent in the euro area, are likely to hinge crucially on the persistence of the recent rise in real estate prices.  The rest of this char t focuses on the vulnerability of Latin Amer ican countries to an increase in global interest rates.  As shown on  the middle left, EMBI+ spreads are now above their lows early this year but rema in narrow, suggesting  that investors are relatively optimistic about thes e countries but perhaps also reflecting some willingness to “reach for yield” in a low interest rate environment.  As show n on the middle right, over the past year or so Latin American coun tries have responded to the narrow spreads by stepping up their issuance of external debt, but the pace of i ssuance has remained modest in historical terms.    The bottom panel compares recent readin gs on the vulnerabili ty of major Latin American countries against read ings taken on the eve of interest rate tightening a decade ago.  For Mexico (line 1), these indicators s how a striking improvem ent.  The country’s current account deficit as a percent of GDP ha s narrowed more than 4 percentage points, and external debt has fallen to low leve ls.  Similarly, Chile (line 2) seems well positioned to withstand higher gl obal interest rates.  The co untry’s external indebtedness has risen over the past decade, but its foreig n reserves have moved up as well, and most of the country’s debt is of lo ng maturity.  Brazil (line 3) is now running a small current account surplus, which limits the need for ne w external financing.  Nevertheless, the government’s heavy debt burden— including both its external debt and its hefty stock of short-term domestic debt (not shown)—leaves the country exposed to shifts in the economic environment, especially in the event of policy slip pages by the Lula government.  Finally, Argentina has defaulted on its massive external debt and remains at loggerheads with its creditors.  With  these developments, inflows of foreign investment have come to a halt,  and a marked rise in global  interest rates could further complicate Argentina’s financial situation.   Your final international chart examines the possibility of a hard landing in China.  As shown on the top left, Ch inese real investment has surged more than 30 percent during the past year, and this, in turn, has fueled double-digit GDP growth.  To slow the pace of investment, the Chin ese authorities have ratcheted up reserve requirements and implemented a number of administrative measures.  Notably, recent data suggest that these actions are having signifi cant effects.  While our baseline forecast incorporates a soft landing for China, the me asures that the authorities have  put in place may yet prove too heavy-handed.  Thus, as we  discussed in an alte rnative simulation in th e Greenbook, a much steeper falloff in Ch inese growth than we presently envision is distinctly possible.   73 of 203  The table on the top right focuses on two channels th rough which a hard landing might spill over to the globa l economy.  The first column  reports a given country’s exports to China as a share of GDP; the second column re ports a country’s net exports of commodities worldwide, al so scaled by its GDP.  Certainly those economies that export heavily to China—such as Taiwan , the ASEAN countries, and Korea (lines 1-3)—would be significantly harmed by a hard landing and an accompanying decline in Chinese import demand.  However, for impo rters of commodities—such as Taiwan and Korea—there would likely be some  offset, if a cooling in Chin a took pressure off global commodity prices.  In addition,  a large share of Ch ina’s imports from emerging Asia is eventually re-exported.  Chinese demand for such imports depends on global conditions and might weather a hard landin g relatively well.  Outside of emerging Asia, countries such as Chile (line 4), Argentina (line 6), an d Russia (line 7) would be hurt by the hard landing both because they ha ve sizable exports to China and because they are net exporters of commodities.  Am ong the industrial countries, Ja pan (line 5) would be the most affected by a hard landing, with export s to China now accountin g for 2.1 percent of its GDP.  The fallout for the euro area (line 9) and the United States (line 12) would likely be much smaller than for Japan.  There are other channels through which a hard landing in China might be felt.  For exam ple, it could sour business and consumer confidence in other emerging  Asian economies and Japan and weigh on sentiment in global financial markets.  Indeed, as shown on the middle left, over the past few months, as concerns about China have come to the fore, equity markets in some emerging Asian economies—most notably in Taiwan and Ko rea—have moved down significantly.  A hard landing would probably also weaken capital flows to emerging Asia and thus reduce upward pressure on the renminbi and other currencies in the region.   The bottom panels sum up my  remarks by assessing the implications of our foreign outlook for the U.S. external s ector.  Although grow th abroad (the blue  bars on the left) is likely to put in a solid pe rformance through the end of next year, it will trail the pace of U.S. expansion.  This gr owth differential—alo ng with the greater income sensitivity of U.S. imports—should boost U.S. imports relative to ex ports.  However, the lagged effects of the dollar’s depreciation since 2002 will work in the opposite direction, boosting exports relative to imports.  With these factors about balancing out, our forecast calls for exports and imports (both shown on the right) to grow at roughly comparable rates, rising at a doub le-digit pace during the se cond half of this ye ar and then tempering to 8 percent growth next year.  Nevertheless, as the level of imports far exceeds the level of exports, net export s will become more negative, subt racting about ½ percentage point from U.S. real GDP growth du ring th e second half of this  year and in 2005.  David Wilcox will now conc lude our presentation. 

[SECTION]

 MR. WILCOX.  Your final chart displays your economic projections for 2004 and 2005.  As shown in the top pane l, the central tendency of y our projections for the growth of real GDP this year is only slightly different than it was at the February meeting, and the central tendency for the unemployment rate  in the fourth quarter  is unrevised.  For inflation, no February comparis on is available because this is  the first time that you have been asked to forecast core rather than over all inflation.  For ne xt year, your central 74 of 203  tendencies indicate a moderation in the pa ce of growth, a slight decline in the unemployment rate, and little change  in core PCE price inflation.   As we have already noted, some importan t information became available after the close of the Greenboo k.  In response to that info rmation, the staff trimmed our projection for real growth this year and lifted our forecast for core PC E price inflation.  For reference, the figures in the final column—labeled “Sta ff”—pertain to this updated projection rather than the Greenbook foreca st.  Over the next several days, you may wish to consider whether to update your proj ection; if you decide to do so, we request that you submit your revised forecasts to Dave Stockton an d me by the close of business on Friday of this week.  We would now be pleased to take any qu estions you may have. 

[SECTION]

 MR. LACKER.  I have a question for David.  First, I want to applaud the analytical focus on the behavior of the price markup since it obviously has swung a lot in the last  couple of years and it is a key swing determinant in the inflation outlook .  I was wondering to what  extent the markup is a forward-looking variable in the mode ls you use.  In many  analytical or theoretical models of price determination it is, in the same sense that the sa ving rate is a forward- looking variable in the permanent-income model.  Second, I was just curious:  What kind of error bands or uncertainty band charts would it be possible to  construct about the price markup? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  We have a new specification of FRB/US that inco rporates explicitly forward-looking behavior in the setting of prices by fi rms.  In a manner that’s  often referred to as a neoclassical synthesis, we have some sort of momentum-based or backwa rd-looking influence on price setting as well as some explicitly forward-look ing behavior.  That forw ard-looking behavior in the wage–price block in FRB/US is rational in the sense that it’s model consistent within that three-equation block.  And roughly speaki ng, both are about equa lly influential.  So if you thought about a coefficient of 1 in the context of  accelerating inflation, you’d ha ve about half on the backward-looking portion and about half on  the forward-looking portion. With respect to constructing erro r bands, we wrestled with that  issue fairly hard in putting together the exhibit that explored uncertainty, and we  decided not to do it b ecause the markup itself 75 of 203  isn’t a fundamental variable in the model.  It derives from and reflects a lot of other more fundamental influences.  The conclusion we arrive d at was that, if we ha d shown you confidence intervals that might be generate d by markup uncertainty, we woul d have ended up sort of double-counting sources of uncertainty.  So in that framework it’s diffic ult to put a confidence interval around uncertainty.  Mo re impressionistically, just eyeballing this chart suggests  to me that there is a lot of uncertainty about the future behavior of the markup.  We’ve wrestled as well with whether that variable is best  thought of as a stationary variable that  returns to a well-def ined mean.  You can see from the chart in the middle panel in chart 11 that, depending on  what sample period you chose to draw the blue line, you woul d get a different number for th e average to wh ich it should be returning.  So I think in general there is a good deal of uncertainty surrounding the future behavior of the markup even though we have a ha rd time actually quantifying it for you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With resp ect to chart 5, I notice that  the profit share is shown as the ratio of economic profits before tax to GNP.  W hy not to corporate GDP?  Or if you want to include the foreign earnings, put that in on the denom inator as well.  W hy are you using GNP? 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  I think just because that’s a convention we’ve had fo r a long time, but we can plot it to GDP. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  put it this way.   Some conventions get outmoded.  We are no longer driving the Model T Ford, so why ar e we doing this? 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  We can certainly change that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I know the Greenboo k uses this measure.  It has always struck me as a fairly historical practice from  a time when we didn’t  have data sources. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  We’ll be happy to change it.  The impression th at one gets from alternative measures of the profit share using a denominator of the type suggested basically—  76 of 203 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, it’ s slightly different.  In the chart, the 2001 low is higher relative to 1980, and a few other relationshi ps here are different.  That’s because there is a significant moving share involvin g lots of noncorporate GDP tre nds.  Second, with respect to nonresidential structures, I haven’t looked at the relationship between the stock of nonresidential structures in constant do llars and potential.  How do those two variables run against each other these days?  I’m raising the question in the context of on e measure of whether we’r e running into capacity restraints and whether or not structur es per se are as reflective of that  as they used to be many years ago.  I was curious:  How should one be looking at industrial constr uction, for example, or broader private nonresidential construction as an indication of whether ther e is ample capacity relative to potential? 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  I would offer a coup le of observations.  The first is that there is a long-term trend over the past twenty to thir ty years for corporate investment to be shifted toward shorter-lived assets and away from structures because of pronounced  price declines in real terms.  So the stock of structures in the NIPA has not been growing very  rapidly, and I’m confident it has been growing less rapidly than potential. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think it always has. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  Yes, I think that’s  right.  And in the past coup le of years the stock has been growing particularly slowly because construction has been at a low level.  At the same time, there’s a lot of unused space out there.  When we look at vacancy rate s for the office sector, they are still close to the highs that we saw in the last couple of quarters, an d industrial vacan cy rates are still pretty high.  Really only in the retail sector does it appear that vacanci es are at relatively low historical levels. 77 of 203 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If yo u combine all the vacancy ra tes—well, we don’t have data for the service sector, which is growing.  The reas on I raise the issue is  that, if we’re getting concerned about our measures of ga p, there are alternate tests of sh ortages and we ought to look at them because that’s obviously crucial to our asse ssment of the outlook and our policy decisions.  Governor Bernanke.  

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you.  It didn’t pass my notice th at the first part of the presentation was in the form of a financial stability report, wh ich I found very useful, and I commend the staff for that .  I have a question about chart 4 for the household sector  and about chart 5 for the business sector, where you show the average interest rate  on the stock of debt vis-à-vis the rate on new debt.  I just note that that’s an averag e and, if we’re thinking about financial distress, we might be concerned about the tail s of the distribution.  Do we have any information about the 90th percentile or anything of that so rt that would describe  whether a significant portion of households and firms are in a danger zone? 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  In the household sector, we definitely think there are pockets where financial problems still exist.  The bankruptcy rate has come down over the pa st half year from where it was at the end of  last year, but it is st ill quite high.  Most deli nquency rates have been coming down as well, but the levels of some of them are still relatively elevated.  So there is certainly a component of the household sector in which financial stre ss is a consideration.  As for the business sector, our feeling is that the tail has probably gotten quite  small at this point.  We do look at the most distressed part of the speculative-grade universe of nonfinancial firm s, and for them there has been a marked improvement in the ty pes of financial ratios that I showed here. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 78 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. MINEHAN.  I want to follo w up a bit on what Jeff was asking—not so much on the the path for the CPI is similar to that for the PCE—i.e., there’s a bl ip up this year that fades off toward the end of the year and into  next year, for similar reasons.  If you were to do  the uncertainty calculations using core CPI instead  of PCE, would they look di fferent?  And what would the numbers look like on the upper end of that? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  No reasons come immediatel y to mind on why the main qualitative findings of chart 10 woul dn’t hold true with resp ect to the CPI as well.  Energy prices have an important influence on core CPI. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  The mechanics of it don’t  make the result look any different? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  There are differences in weight s, so I’m sure that there would be small changes, but I can’t think of why qualitatively it wo uldn’t be quite similar. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  My recollectio n is as well, from the gene ral Greenbook projections we do, that the sizes of the confiden ce intervals around our core CPI fo recast are similar to those around our core PCE forecast. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Just looking at the most recent three-month change in the core CPI, an annual rate number beginnin g with 3 has an impact on the way peop le think about future inflation.  I still think people look more at th e CPI numbers than at  the PCE numbers just  because people are used to seeing the CPI and it is more relevant to them.  So, I’m wondering whether numbers that could potentially stay on the high side might ha ve a greater impact—because of their effect on inflation expectations— in terms of this distribution of uncertainty.  

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  That could be, thr ough an expectations channel.  As I noted with respect to the channel in the bottom ri ght corner of char t 7, that’s one of the reas ons we think the Michigan 79 of 203  survey results for the short-term expectations have moved up as sharply as they have.  It reflects the inflation that individuals are experiencing. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.  There’s hardly anybody who believes that prices for them are increasing at only a 1½ percent rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX. Right, but that was true even when we think prices really were increasing at 1½ percent!       

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That’s very true because for most people the things they care about most were going up more than that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  I just wanted to compliment the staff on the work in the chart show on  inflation.  I thought it  was quite thorough and sh ed a lot of light on an obviously very important area of co ncern for this Committee.  I wa s hoping that you would shed a little more light on th e expectations side, which you  didn’t talk a great deal about here.  We’re going through a period now when  final price increases have accelerate d.  Some of the in creases are being passed through to the core measur e, which is going up in part be cause of temporary factors that hopefully will phase out so that the core rate  will be going up at a somewhat slow er pace but  still at a rate higher than we’ve seen in the immediate past .  I was wondering if you’ ve thought at all about how this affects expectati ons for inflation. The upward shift is explained now in terms of temporary factors, but when we get past this—if we’re correct about these temporary factors and they are indeed transitory and cease—what impact will th is have on inflation expectations? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Again, with refe rence to that panel in the bo ttom corner of chart 7, we would expect to see short-term inflation expectations come back down as commodity prices and energy prices moderate.  When we run a very simple regression of this short-term inflation 80 of 203  expectation on some la gged values of actual top-line consumer price inflation, we  can explain most of the recent run-up in the Michigan survey on inflation expectati ons.  So it looks about roughly in line with what one would have ex pected, given historical experience and the influence of those prices on the expectations that people report to the survey takers .  If the energy-price moderation that we anticipate comes to pass, we think those inflation expectatio ns will come back down.  We view inflation expectations as a pretty important part of the dynamics an d the challenge that you confront as monetary policy makers.  And we think one thing that’s making your  job a little easier than it would otherwise be is that longer-term infla tion expectations haven’t moved up as yet.  But as everyone around this table is aware, the credibility associated wi th that is not so mething that can be taken for granted. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  We’ll be watching this very carefully. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  As will we. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you.  I think the discussion of the inflation outlook has been helpful, but it does raise some questions about the sense of optimism in the projection in terms of inflation coming back down as quickly as it does.  I’d just  like to ask for your reaction because it has been our experience, both when infl ation comes down and when it goes up, that we underpredict the change either way.  It is on its way back up now, and we’re saying it’s not going to continue at a very strong pace, and yet history te lls us that we sometimes get behind  the curve ourselves.  Part of the reason I worry ab out that is that the output gap is actua lly fairly small and closing rapidly, I think; at least, that’s  what some projections are showing.   And the difference between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU is fairly small; in fact, depending  on what the NAIRU really is, the difference could be zero.  Looking at where policy is right now, the fed funds rate is so low 81 of 203  relative to where neutral most likely is, and we get to neutral so slowly  in this projection, that I think this inflation outlook is fairly optimistic—even with the error ba nds around it.  I just have a sense that we perhaps need to be less optimistic on this.  My view is based upon the de gree to which I think the projections are overstating the difference between the NAIRU and the actual unemployment rate and are not taki ng into account just how accomm odative policy is right now and will be in the near-term future.  I guess I’m asking you to be so mewhat defensive on this, but it would be helpful for me  if you could do that. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Let me try to give you some  defensive content wi thout the defensive overlay. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Fair en ough.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  First of all, I think one way to phrase your que stion would be to say, How sure are you that inflation is going to come back down?  I’d say that is ab out a 60–40 bet, which is pretty close to even money.  But given the range of  those confidence intervals, I’m trying to point out to the Committee th at there’s a lot of uncertainty surroundi ng that question, in terms of how the baseline will evolve.  A second piece of evidence I would throw out  comes down to essentially the same observation.  With regard to how well our mo dels can account for the evolution of inflation, we think an r2 for an equation for the change in inflation is some thing like 0.5.  This means that half of the variation is not explained by the econometric equation, imperf ect as it is, even though we’ve had a lot of time in the worksh op to tinker w ith the models. Third, recognizing that there’ s a wide error band around the baseline for ecast, I still think that, on balance, the considerat ions that went into the constr uction of the forecast make it a somewhat better bet that inflation is  going to moderate from here fo rward than pick up or stay the same.  Again, those considerations include the revers al of a number of factor s that we believe to be 82 of 203  transitory, which were pushing infla tion up in the first half of this year.  We anticipate, as you note, some continued modest  downward pressure from resource utilization.  We  think we may see a little benefit from a continuing solid pro ductivity performance and the reversal of the trajectories for food prices and import prices.  So thos e are some of the factors that we think line up to make moderating inflation a better bet, though not by a wide margin, than  intensifying inflation.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. MR. FERGUSON.  I have two types of questions.   First, on the infl ation topic we’ve been talking about, I was struck that in  chart 10 you are arguing that the inflation we’v e seen derives from primarily two sources.  One involves a gap-type analysis that you’re evaluating in terms of the NAIRU, and the other involves elements of pass-thro ugh.  You have not put forth any concept that what we may be dealing with is basically some sort of fundamenta l speed effect, maybe indirectly related to the NAIRU.  Es sentially a speed effect versus a potent ial growth rate concept hasn’t come through in your analysis.  And in some sense, a simpler view of inflation as purely a monetary phenomenon also hasn’t come throu gh.  You have chosen the three sources of uncertainty shown in the chart, I think, because  they reflect recent history.  But as you consider other ways of forecasting and thinking about inflation, do these other theo ries or approaches to predicting inflation or understanding inflation have any role in your models or in the wa y you think about inflation going forward? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  First, with respect to the two types of channels, I would like to underscore that the decomposition that is presented here in th is chart is partial.  It is not an exhaustive confidence interval associated w ith the error term.  The reason is  that the error term embeds so 83 of 203  many different influences, including inflation ex pectations, which Presid ent Moskow referred to, commodity price pass-throughs th at may occur through channels other than just energy prices, competitive pressures, and regulatory influences.  It’s the bucket in to which everythi ng in the “all else” category goes.  So I would no t want to characterize our view  as just two ch annels—gaps and these other variables. On the absence of a spee d effect, we looked pretty hard for a speed effect and disposed of a lot of degrees of freedom in the st atistical world in that search.  We think there is a discernible speed effect in the prices of it ems that are in relatively inelastic shor t-term supply.  But for final core PCE prices, we can’t find it.  And we ’re reassured in that by reference to some particular historical episodes like the recovery from the very deep recession of 1980-82, when  the unemployment rate was rising very rapidly and yet inflation continued to decline.  Now, if there were a strong speed effect, it should have shown up during that pe riod, and it didn’t.  So we’ve looked hard on the econometrics, and we’ve done some case studies, and neither approach leads us to think that there’s much there. With respect to direct monetary influence—wh ether money itself show s up in inflation—we think it’s important, but we think it’s important in settin g the background fact ors that we believe influence the inflation dy namics more fundamentally.  We think that what monetary  policy is doing is altering the balance of factors like the gap and resour ce utilization, for exam ple.  When we have moved to test a direct influen ce of money in our price equation,  it’s a little like a mirage on the highway:  Sometimes it’s there a little bit, and so metimes it disappears.  We can’t find a reliably strong statistical relationship.  So we think this is a good, albeit imperfect, framework to use for the entire analysis. 84 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MR. FERGUSON.  The other question I have deal s with chart 3, on housing prices.  My question is about the footnote, which says that the rent–price ratio is adjusted for biases in the trends of both rents and prices.  Is that  where you pick up demographics and lifecycle factors?  What are these biases in the trends, and how does one thin k about changing demographics and the relative attractiveness of owning a home versus renting?  Gi ve me some sense of whet her or not the shape of the curve that you show here is likely to reverse, as you imply, or likely to stay relatively low. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  The biases referred to in that footnote were really technical biases in the construction of the two measures shown here, the rent measure and the price measure.  Had we not adjusted for them, the rent-to-price ratio would have been much lower at the end point.   So it would have looked more alarming.  In part we think the published data have some technical problems that need to be taken care of before this analysis  can be done in a way that is meaningful. With regard to the question of owning versus re nting, it depends to some extent on what is happening to interest rates because that changes that calculation at the margin.  So it’s really important to plot any kind of valuation measure re lative to an opportunity cost.  Just showing the rent-to-price ratio I think would have been somewhat misleading; it’s really that gap that we think is the meaningful measure of valuatio n.  And it looks some what rich, taking acco unt of the fact that interest rates are relative ly low and income growth has been rela tively strong.  I d on’t want to leave the impression that we  think there’s a huge housing bubble.  We believe a lot of the rise in house prices is rooted in fundamentals.  But even after you account for the fundamental s, there’s a part of the increase that is hard to explain. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I, too, though t the presentation by the staff was very good this morning.  I must say, as one who is going to  talk about similar things in my  own remarks, mine is going to 85 of 203  sound a little lame in comparison!  But there wa s one issue that you  didn’t talk abou t this morning, and not much was said abou t it in the briefing on Monday or in the Greenbook  either.  And that is, despite the low utilization rate, wages have kept up.  Does that worry you?  Is this something that is a reversion to normal in a regression equation, or is this the start of some thing that we ought to worry about? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  We think wages are being suppor ted by the rapid produc tivity growth that we’ve had over the last few years.  We think that is adding a tenth this year, for example, compared with last year and another couple of tenths next year.  On the ot her hand, overall we don’t see ECI compensation accelerating greatly.  One of the influences on the ECI that we believe will hold it down is health insura nce costs, which we expect to  contribute less to the rise  in ECI this year.  Also, we actually think that  in 2003 the growth of EC I was a little stronger than we could acc ount for in our models, and we project that that puzzle will go away. So the balance of all those factors leaves our projection just slightly  flat this year compared  with last year and up only a little next year.  There are risks.  One of the risks to that comp ensation projection, which we’ve highlighted, is the the baseline or if firms are more  eager to ramp up their produc tion than we’ve assumed, that compensation trajectory could turn  out to be too optimistic.   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Governor Gra mlich, those figures did get ou r attention, though.  There were upward revisions to the nonfarm business comp hours starting in the fourth quarter of last year, and we also missed on th e ECI in the first quarter— it came in higher than we had projected.  That was one of the factors that prompted  us to go back and look at ou r estimates of bo th the NAIRU and potential output.  We made a very marginal, almost cosmetic, upward revision to our estimate of the NAIRU—we raised it by just a te nth—but we also revised down po tential output just because we 86 of 203  thought the overall c onstellation of wage and price data was mo re negative than we had anticipated, given our previous estimates of the levels of poten tial output and the gap.  So I think we ’ve tried to respond to that, but it was someth ing we found troubling vis-à-vis th e views that we held in April. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO.  I want to  follow up on what you just said, David.  You mentioned that less slack wasn’t the major contributor to the bulk of  the rise in inflation, but you didn’t comment on exactly how much your es timate for slack has changed.  Can you tell us how much you reduced that estimate from the ti me of the May Greenbook?  You made a few remarks about that, but is that the sole explanation for the change  in the fed funds rate path from  the May Greenboo k to the current Greenbook?  There is a significant change in that path.  Is it all a reflection of the change in that estimate for slack? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  I’d say that tw o factors are behind the revisi ons we made to the federal funds rate assumptions that unde rlie our forecast.  One, import antly, was the downward revisions we made to potential output.  In essence, those downward revisions suggested to us that you needed to be closer to neutral by the en d of our forecast period than we ha d previously assumed.  A piece of that—and these are all simultane ously determined within our forecasting system—was that the inflation figures were higher as well.   We didn’t think that revising up our inflation forecast as much as we did, without making a co rresponding adjustment to the federal funds rate—and therefore allowing the real federal funds rate  to be on a weaker pa th than we ha d in the last forecast—would be warranted.  So the higher inflation and the lower estimate of potential output suggested to us that the underlying path for the funds rate probably need ed to be steeper than we had been assuming previously. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. 87 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MR. STERN.  Dave, one thing th at surprised me about the baseline forecast and also about most of the simulations was the flat ten-year Treasury  rate.  If I want to take, say, the market-based funds rate scenario and assume that the ten-year rate goes up about half as much as the funds rate over that period, then as a first approximation should I just extrapolate or interpolate the real growth and unemployment numbers based on that?  Or do  you think there’s mo re going on there? 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  Maybe I’ll just start off by talking for a mo ment about how we got the assumption for the ten-year rate.  We begin by asking ourselves wh ere we think the ten-year rate would go by the end of our forecas t period under the market-based assumption for the funds rate.  Our guess is that it would be up about ½ percentage point from wher e it is now, just using the usual term structure arguments that relate short-term rates to long -term rates.  So  we deviated from that by holding the ten-year rate essentially flat.  That refl ects our belief that, if our view for inflation turns out to be correct, there will be a favorable market surprise that w ill keep the ten-year rate from rising along the path that it otherwise would have taken. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  In our alternativ e simulation for that market-b ased funds rate, we have the ten-year Treasury bond rate co ming up 20 basis points by the end of the forecast period. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Right.  I was spec ulating that it might be more than that.  Presumably you’ve got a greater impact on the ten-year rate in the market-based scenario. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Obviously, it depends a little on whether rates move up earlier in our projection period or later.  My guess is that if there were a si gnificant surprise on long-term interest rates next year, most of the impact  of that would probably be felt la te in the year and moving into 2006. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Okay. 88 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MR. BERNANKE.  President Stern,  I asked the staff to calcul ate for me if we followed exactly the path of the funds rate that is now built  into markets, where the ten-year rate would be a year from now.  And their an swer was 30 basis points hi gher than it is today.  So, it is not 50 percent  of the rise in the funds rate. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

 MS. BIES.  I have a question on chart 3 on th e commercial real estate valuation.  Having lived through the 1986-91 period when the NOI(net operating income )–price ratio wa s down to the levels it is today, I look at that  period as abnormal b ecause we had tax changes that were retroactive, which basically put a lot of real estate projects and ownership under water.  So we had a tremendous upheaval in the real estate market , with people filing for bankrupt cy and dumping pr operties.  It worries me that we’re back down in a sense to a situ ation that is comparable to that severe turn in the real estate market.  I really  look at that as a good example of how retroactive taxes affect people’s return targets when they enter into long -lived projects. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  I was actually here  at the Board during that pe riod, and I remember that we were concerned as well in the la te ’80s about real es tate valuations and th e amount of construction still going on given that th e tax benefits had been withdrawn in 1986.  We did not really understand what the rationale was in the mark et.  Ultimately it tu rned out that there wa s a massive amount of over-construction and lendin g standards that were to o lax.  I think there ar e some reasons to be watchful of developments in the co mmercial construction sector at th is point.  It is clear that the compensation for risk has go tten somewhat thinner in this market than it wa s throughout the 1990s, presumably after market participants had learned so me lessons from the very thin compensation that they accepted through the ’8 0s.  On the other hand, we do see so me rather substan tial differences in the structure of the commercial real estate market at this  time.  Lending standards do seem to have 89 of 203  held much firmer.  And there’s a lot more transparency in the market now because of the more widespread availability of data on prices and rents to market participants.  So we think the alert to developments  in that market.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  Just to follow up  on what Roger was asking about the panel in chart 3 on housing valuations.  In that panel the relative move ment of the two measures is somewhat key to at least the intuitive persuasi veness of the argu ment that housing might be overvalued .  I understand the units of the real long-term Treasu ry yield.  I don’t understand the units of the rent-to-price ratio.   

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  The rent and the pr ice data come from different sources; they are not part of an integrated system.  The rent data are from th e CPI, which is itself onl y an index number.  So there is no way to say th e rent–price ratio is 8 percent—like an earnings–price ratio, for example. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It is proportiona l to whatever that  number would be. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  Yes.  We could ma ke the level of the red line anything we wanted to, but we could only move it in a leve l adjustment up and down. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  But you set the s cale, too, right?  You could se t it so that the zeroes are the same on both axes? 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  Right.  With creative charting we could make the relationship between the two series shift up and dow n however we wanted.  That’s why we’re stressing— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Bu t that’s not so for the ratio between those two series.  That is invariant to the scale. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  Yes, that’s true; they ought to have the same zeroes it seems. 90 of 203 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No , no.  If you have a relative me asure that is an actual ratio, the ratio of the two numbers is invariant to what the relative number is. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  That’s right.  But in the chart,  the staff has the zero set at very different places on the two scales. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You can’t trust them to do it right!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  I’m just wonderin g, how did you decide where to  put the zero?  If you put it much closer to where the zero is  for the long-run Treasury rate, the squiggles in the red line would be a lot smaller. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  You can make the squiggle s as small or as large as you want. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  Right.  And your  argument has to do with the size of the squiggles? 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.  No, I think the argum ent has to do with the size of the gap between the two.  And the current gap relative to its average over history—  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Th e scale will not change  the fact that the gap is closing.  The conclusion is independent of the scale.  You could try any variat ion you want, and that gap will always close.   

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  The gap between these two lines?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. MR. OLINER.  No matter what we used for our charting convention,  the gap would be relatively narrow now co mpared with its hi storical average. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Just take the ratio of the two ratios, an d it will be going down. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  That’s  fine for now. 91 of 203 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions?  I no ticed in some of the monthly data that the productivity numbers  in the second quarte r seem to be coming in  under the 2.4 percent Greenbook forecast.  Is that your sense?  I note that the compensation per hour seems okay, but the figures implicit in the personal in come data at least suggest that  we would be ge tting a somewhat higher unit labor cost than  is in the Greenbook.  

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  In the Greenboo k we had nonfarm business prod uctivity at 2.4 percent.  A quick update of that based on th e information that we received on Friday and Monday would put it at 1.9 percent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So it’s a somewhat higher unit labor cost? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Unit labor co sts are up 0.4, right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Okay.  Who would like to start the Committee di scussion?  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Th e expansion in the Se venth District now appears extremely broad-based.  Very few sectors are weak, and so me are booming.  This may be hyperbole, but several of our contacts said that the business climate was as  strong as they can remember.  One of our directors, whose private S corporatio n shows about fo rty different businesses, said that he can’t r ecall when so many  companies in so many di fferent industries were doing so well.  Similarly, the na tional temporary-help firms headquart ered in our District report that their business is finally following a classic recovery growth pa th.  And the Chic ago Purchasing Managers’ report, which is being released this morn ing, continued to show expansion, albeit with a sharp decline from 68 in May to  56.4 in June.  We recently held our annu al automotive outlook symposium, and the overall mood was upbeat.  Thir ty-five industry expert s submitted forecasts, and their consensus was for light  motor vehicle sales to increase to 17 million units in the second half of 92 of 203  this year and be at about the same pace in 2005.  These numbers  are lower than the Greenbook forecast, especially for ’05.  And a truck industry analys t forecasted that produc tion in medium- and heavy-duty trucks would rise from about 300,000 la st year to 370, 000 in 2004 and to 460,000 in 2005. So, given that the expansion in real activity seems to be on such a so lid footing, I’d like to focus on what we’ve heard about emerging inflat ionary pressures.  Certainly, more firms are reporting price increases.  Euphemisms like “price restoration” and “fuller pricing” are common.  Some price increases are related to higher energy costs and strengthening worldwide demand for steel and other commodities.  We know that prices for many commod ities have come down of late, as was mentioned be fore, but it is still too early to know whether they’ve peak ed.  Many other reports suggest bottlenecks in sectors where sales have increased rapidly, such as construction equipment, agricultural equipment, and fiberboard packaging.  In some cases, inventories of raw materials and parts were low; in others, supply chain bottlenecks led firms to use higher-cost alternatives like air freight to avoid parts shor tages and production delays.  So will these price increases become permanent?  We obviously don’t know yet.  One good sign we’ve heard is that, while a number of our contacts sa id they were willing to accept recently impo sed price surcharges from their suppliers, they were still resisting base price increases.   This may be a distinction without a difference, but many of our contacts seem determin ed to keep pressu re on their suppliers.  As soon as commodity prices fall, they expect the surcharges to come off.  And thei r plans still as sume lower input costs.  Most contacts report that their profit margins are good, so they may have quite a bit of room to absorb cost incr eases without raising prices.  Indeed, I get the feeling that many of them do not expect their hefty profit margins to continue indefinitely. 93 of 203  Turning to the national outlook, with labor markets firming, the expansion app ears to be on a solid self-sustaining track.  Our own outlook for economic grow th is a bit weaker than the Greenbook’s for ’04 and a bi t stronger for ’05, but the differences  are small.  We now see core PCE inflation rising this year and settling down to around  1½ percent next year.  We interpret the recent increases in inflation as largel y reflecting temporary effects rather than more-sustained price pressures.  And this view seems consistent wi th comments from our regional contacts, which suggest that the economy is not running into fundamental capacity constraints.   With regard to unit labor costs, we expect to see a sustained pickup as labor markets tighten, but I don’t think that the bulk of these increases w ill be passed on to prices.  Rather, as I mentioned earlier, I expect that most will co me out of currently elevated mark ups as labor’s sh are of income moves back up toward more normal levels.  Of course , there is a lot of unce rtainty surrounding this scenario.  I am hearing increasing concerns that the Federal Reserve might be behind the curve.  I personally think our credibility is so lid, but if higher inflationary expectations beco me entrenched, that would obviously make our  job much more difficult. If inflation remains on the moderate path that I expect, then a measured pace of policy moves would li kely be appropriate.  Howeve r, the Committee mu st have the flexibility to act more aggressively if inflationary pressures intensif y.  We think financial ma rkets as well as the nonfinancial sectors could handle aggressive moves, if needed.  This was also the view of academic and business economists we  met with last week.  So the pol icy statement should reiterate what we’ve all been saying in public—that we will do whatever is nece ssary to maintain price stability.  The statement should  not give the appearance of  constraining th e Committee’s freedom of action at subsequent meetings.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 94 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  By almost any measure, economic activity has picked up in New England and shows signs of being on a solid upward trend.  Regional employment grew for the third consecutive month in May, bringing the region’s job count even with its year-ago level.  Only in Massachusetts has the employment level continued to be below that of a year ago.  Simila rly, the unemployment rate in the region, while bouncing from month to month, is well below both its high and the comparable data for the nation as a whole.  Consumer confidence has been off of late, possibly reflecting lower wage gains in the region than nationally, and spending is growing more slow ly than elsewhere as well.  Quit e possibly both of these will pick up as the employment situation contin ues to brighten.  In that regard , business confid ence is good.  Business spending is reported to be solid.  Merc handise exports have been  growing strongly.  And the stock indexes that Bloomberg do es for the region have outperformed  their national counterparts.  Even the fiscal picture for state government is brightening, with revenue growth above budget for the first half of fiscal year 20 04, though structural deficits and prospective fu nding challenges remain.  Anecdotally, most contacts report strengthening  in current business conditions and in their outlook for the future—m oving, as one said, fro m cautious optimism to more optimism than caution.  Most of our contacts, including me mbers of our New England Advisory Council and attendees at recent economic  forums we’ve held, reported increases in sales, orders, or revenues in the first quarter of the year.  Virt ually all of them also mentioned input cost increases, including for steel, oil and oil-related products, and transportation and delivery costs.  President Poole might want to inform his contacts at UPS and FedEx that, at  least among small busine sses in New England, there is a revolt building because of the high cost and service restrictions related to FedEx and UPS package deliveries.  One gift and specialty manuf acturer, whose peak peri ods include Valentine’s 95 of 203  Day and Mother’s Day, wa s surprised to find her next-day vol ume capped on the day before those holidays.  Not a good thing for a business that she says is built on love and guilt.  [Laughter]  Despite these and other rising costs, even smaller firms report that they have more pricing power and are able to pass on  cost increases.  Even  in the highly competitiv e world of supplying car manufacturers, price increases re lated to steel and o il costs were passed on, and those increases stuck.  Finding sufficiently capa ble labor even for entry-level positions has become a problem as well.  In particular in the hosp itality industry, the limits on H-2B  visas are a serious problem for seasonal firms.  A lack of labor supply continues to encourage, if not inspire, the search for productivity improvements at firms large and small. In sum, the situation is bette r in New England now than at any time since late 2001 and there seems to be lit tle reason to suspect that  the pace of overall progress  will diminish much, at least over the next year or year  and a half.  New Engl and has lagged the United States a bit in the recovery, but I expect it will catch up this summer  or later in the year. Looking at the national data and thinking about the worries at this ti me last year, one can only marvel at how fast things can  change from job loss to job gr owth, from policy- induced to what looks like self-sustaining demand, and from worries ab out deflation to real concerns about inflation.  Incoming data suggest that both consumer and business demand are so lid, and the pace of hiring has surpassed expectations.  The rest of the world is growing, and fis cal policy is like ly to remain expansionary this ye ar.  Assuming curtailment of the invest ment tax credit next year, fiscal policy will be less e xpansionary.  But who knows about cont inued spendi ng on the militar y or otherwise? Boston’s forecasts for the ne xt year and a half don’t di ffer much from those of the Greenbook when done using similar funds rate assumptions.  That is, we see what one could view as a near perfect combination of quite solid growth, con tinued strong productivity trends, slowly 96 of 203  falling unemployment, and rates of in flation that moderate af ter the pickup in the first half of ’04.  This forecast is shaped by the assessment of sl ack remaining in the econo my and the belief that growth will not be constrained by resources for some time, perhaps not unti l year-end 2005.  Thus, broad-based inflationary pressures—not just those associated with what is se en as a temporary blip in oil prices—should not be an issue.  Under both Bost on’s and the Board’s staff forecasts, policy should begin to tighten bu t can move up slowly to a level below that of market expectations by the end of 2005.   However, I think this forecast ou tcome is about as goo d as it gets.  Even if it is the most likely outcome, the risks ar ound it seem to me to be substantial and appear to be weighted on the upside, at least to the extent that  such risks don’t invol ve unpredictable geopolitic al events.  That is, it is hard for me to feel  particularly confident about a sizabl e remaining output gap when inflation data for both the firs t and second quarters, whether meas ured by the CPI or PCE and whether looked at overall or on the basis of core estimates, show a substan tial uptick.  The best guess may be that this sharp upturn is temporary, but two things about inflation seem undebatable:  It has flattened, and its near- to medium -term trajectory is up.  Just as the speed of the pickup in employment has been a surprise this year, so too c ould we be surprised on th e upside by inflation.  The Greenbook alternatives capture this in the higher infl ation expectations scenario, but I suspect that some combinatio n of stronger demand, less  room to grow, and rising inflation expectations could work together to produce an outcome more negative than that alternative.  That’s perhaps not a high probability even t, but it’s one that  does concern me. In that regard, I think the time has come to start moving the fed funds ra te up and to get real short-term rates first to a positive position and then to a more neutral level.  The markets expect this. If we don’t start doing it, I think the yield curve probably will steepen with a rise  in the inflation 97 of 203  premium.  Moreover, I also think it’s time to rem ove from our statement an y characterization of how we will act in the future.  Let’s say what we are doing, why we are doing  it, and comment on the risks, but let’s not make any implied commitments about the pace of our actions go ing forward.  The risks are real.  We may or ma y not want to characterize them as mostly one-sided but we ought to reserve the capability to deal  with them as we see fit when, and if, they materialize.

MR. SANTOMERO.  Than k you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Third District continues to expand and, in  contrast to the last ti me we met, I can now repo rt that we’ve seen solid job growth in the region.  Payro ll employment in our three states rose 0.6 percent from the first quarter to the first two months of  the second quarter, matching th e national increase.  Each of the states has reported employment gains, and the gains were widespread across industries, with employment up in all of  the major sectors except ma nufacturing.  The most r ecent data show that in New Jersey and Delaware payr oll employment has recovered from the recession trauma.  But Pennsylvania still has a way to go to make up for j obs lost since the st art of the recovery; specifically, Pennsylvania payrolls remain about ½ percentage point belo w the recession trough.  The three states’ unemployment rates edged do wn to 5.1 percent in Apri l and May.  We are still receiving some reports that firms are having difficulty finding quali fied workers, a point we just heard from Boston. The other sectors in our District continue to perform well.  Retail sales and general merchandise remain on a fairly co nsistent upward trend, although auto sales have slowed somewhat and appear to be softer than else where in the nation.  Most retail ers have become more optimistic about sales in the second ha lf of the year.  Commerci al real estate markets in  the region remain soft, but residential construction activity and home sales have been strong.  Home  prices in our region 98 of 203  continue to appreciate at a steady rate, but our contac ts in the residential real estate market said that some homes are taking longer to se ll now than they did earlier this year.  Manufacturing activity in the region continues to expand.  Our business outlook survey index of general activity increased to 28.9 percent in June, up fr om 23.8 percent in May.  The index ha s been in positive territory for over a year now.  The more forward-lo oking indexes of new orders and sh ipments also improved in June, with all industry classifications ex cept food and transportation show ing positive read ings.  The head of a large trucking compa ny in our region reports th at orders from March to early June have been as strong as is usually seen during  the peak transportation months  preceding the Christmas holidays—a phenomenon he says is extremely rare.  Indeed, it is  very rare to see succes sive strong months at peak levels during a nonpeak period.  We continue to get readings of rising prices in our regi on.  The same trucking company contact I just mentioned said that fuel surcharges  are common and that ev en his largest customers are now willing to pay these surcharges.  So tr ansportation costs are rising  significantly.  He also reported that labor is in very short supply.  And he  expects truckers’ wage rates to rise substantially this year, following the first-ever successful strike by independent trucking contractors.  That strike occurred in California and, according to the press,  is spreading across the country.  The prices-paid and prices-received indexes in our manufacturing su rvey eased a bit in June but remained at nine-year highs.  In response to a spec ial survey question in May, nearly half of our respon dents said they had raised prices since the beginning  of the year, and more than half expected to raise prices in the third quarter.  The e xpectations among contacts in the bu siness community are for continued improvement in the re gion’s economy, and I share their view. Turning to the nation, incoming data have conf irmed that the recovery has reached the point of being self-sustaining.  Pr oduction activity continues to expand at a good pace, business 99 of 203  investment is accelerating, and consumer spending continues to ri se at a moderate pace.  With the confirmation that solid job growth is finally at hand, it is my view  that the economy has left the recovery phase and is now  in what we could call an economic expansion. When I compare the Board staff’s forecast with ours, I find that the Greenbook projection, even the most updated one, sees a little less underlying strength in the econom y than our forecast.  We achieve similar outcomes, but th e Philadelphia staff th inks that those outcomes are consistent with a steeper funds rate path than  that in the Greenbook.  We see a bit faster growth this year than the Greenbook does—4.6 percent co mpared with the upda ted 4.4 percent—and somewhat stronger growth of 4.0 percent next year compared w ith the Greenbook’s 3.6 percent.  The Greenbook projects slower productivity grow th and thus faster job growth than in our forecast.  While we expect job growth to average arou nd 200,000 jobs per mo nth for the second half  of the year through 2005, the Greenbook  projects that nonfar m payrolls will rise at an av erage rate exceeding 300,000 per month during the rest of this year before slowing to 200,000 a mont h for much of 2005.   Yet our most significant difference with the Gr eenbook is our view on  inflation.  It is obviously the subject of this meet ing, as we can see fr om the charts and the discussion.  We agree that the first-quarter spik e in core inflation, especially core CPI inflation, will not be repeated.  However, even given our steeper funds rate path, we see a risi ng trend in inflation while the Greenbook has a deceleration.  In  particular, we see the core PCE price index ac celerating from 1.5 percent this year to 1.9 perc ent next year, while the Greenbook  sees it decelera ting from 2.0 to 1.6 percent.  Our forecast reflects the historical evidence that extend ed periods of negative real rates are followed by rapid real growth an d rising inflation, and that for ecast is supported by anecdotal evidence that a growing fr action of firms report that they are raising or  planning to raise prices.  We could be wrong, but it is hard  for me to believe that the Greenbook has it exactly right. 100 of 203  As with all forecasts, there are risks.  On the growth side, I see the risks as balanced.  We have a conservative view of oil prices, assuming a modest drop from the levels of the past few months followed by essentially flat oil prices from the fall of this year through 2005.  My reading of the Board’s memo on energy and our own staff’s work suggest that  we need not be too concerned about the effect of the rise  to date in oil prices.  The increase in real terms has not been as large as past shocks, although it appears to have been more prolonged, and the economy is less reliant on energy for production.  Ther e is some risk of a larger , more persistent rise in oil prices than we have assumed, which could be both contr actionary and inflationary.  On the other hand, oil prices could drop appreciably for an y number of reasons. On the inflation side, I see the risks as ba lanced, provided that we begin to take the necessary steps on the path back toward neutrality.  The Fed has already provide d a lot of liquidity for the financial system, and that degree of liquidity will be come increasingly unnecessary and counterproductive as the expansion proceeds.  I believe that we now need to take the necessary steps to ensure that the recent acceleration in infl ation does not become embedded in inflation expectations.  That means taking action today.  Let’s start this pr ocess of putting th e funds rate on an upward trajectory.  At this po int, I do not really know the speed at which we will  need to move the fed funds rate up in the futu re.  We all know it will depend  upon the incoming information we receive on economic conditions and on our assessment of the outlook  at subsequent meetings.   Given the uncertainty surrounding  inflation dynamics, I believe we should put ourselves in a position of maximum flexibil ity with respect to policy going forward.   In this regard, the less we say now about future actions, the bette r I would feel.  In my view, we  should be in the position to respond to the incoming da ta without having to consider whether a partic ular action is at variance with what we said at our last meeting.  That  suggests simplifying our statement today and/or 101 of 203  limiting our comm itment to the expected  speed with which we think we will have to ad just policy.  Such language was useful when we faced unusual econo mic circumstances.  Today, in my view, language as policy has overstayed its welcome.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto.

MS. PIANALTO.  Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.  Business conditions in the Fourth District began to improve noticeably just before our last meeting in May, and the outlook remains somewhat positive.  After a long period of relative quie t, my business contacts are now busy adjusting to higher sales volumes.  They are installing ne w capital equipment and reorganizing business processes.  They are al so coping with th e volatile pricing environment and, in  a few cases, are beginning to add to payroll.  So  most people in the Fourth Distri ct are expecting a solid year.  I don’t really see much evid ence that the pace of econ omic activity is poised to accelerate further as we head into the second half of this year.  So the Gr eenbook projection for r eal GDP growth in the 4½ to 5 percent range this year, with the pace sl owing somewhat next year, seems consistent with what I hear from my busine ss contacts in the District. CEOs remain disciplined about adding to their payrolls.  They are not allowing the stronger demand for their products to shif t their focus away from  improving productivity.  I hear consistent stories from business persons, whether they’re from  large companies or sma ll companies, that they continue to see opportunities to ad d to their productivity gains today and into the future.  Many of the company executives that I spea k with are talking more and more  about “lean” manufacturing.  They are using these lean manufacturing strategies to  significantly increase the through-put in their facilities by taking unpro ductive steps out of the production process.  And the end results include greater flexibility in their sche duling and enhanced cu stomization of thei r products for their customers.  They find th at they are holding smaller inventories and that their customers need to hold 102 of 203  smaller inventories, and they are able to produce more volume with almost no  additional employees.  In some cases, after comp anies “lean out” the factory floor, they  move on to lean out their back office operations.  So  I’ve seen, at least in  the manufacturing sector, continued growth in productivity. The CEO of a very large global  producer of pneumatic and hydraulic equipm ent told me that his company’s productivity has been increasing at  10 percent annual rates recently and that he sees that continuing for the next  several years.  I know that mi ght be an extreme case, but I’m hearing that kind of stor y from lots of CEOs I ta lk to, again because of th eir use of some of these lean manufacturing techniques.  So I will not be surprised to see the elevated levels of productivity that we have been witnessing in  the manufacturing sector continue  for a while.  Now, on the one hand, the strong productivity gr owth has enabled firms to keep their unit labor co sts lower than otherwise, and that, they say, has enabled them  to limit price increases.  On the other hand, economies do tend to display a close correspondence over time between the rate of productivity growth and the rate  of return on capital and th e equilibrium real rate of interest.  Consequently, and especially since we’ve been talking about the low rate of domestic sa ving in the United States, as I look ahead I do expect to see forces at work that are consistent with a rise  in the equ ilibrium real rate of interest.  I’m le ss confident about the magn itude and timing of that rise than I am about the general direction. At our last meeting, I expressed some concerns about the sign ificant increases in commodity prices and the message that I was getting from CE Os that they had more  pricing power.  I was becoming concerned that those were the first signs of  a fundamental change in the inflation process.  So I spent a great deal of time du ring this intermeeting period ta lking with busine ss leaders about this issue.  The result of  my conversations is that I am not se eing strong evidence that the recent 103 of 203  upsurge in commodity and consumer prices is foreshadowin g a buildup in inflat ionary pressures.  My business contacts report that , while many of the recent comm odity price increas es will stick, others will not.  Energy prices have come back down from their highs , as have some other commodity prices.  In some cases the raw materials price increases can be passed along the supply chain, but a lot of my cont acts still say that ot hers cannot.  And uni t labor costs have not been rising.  So, in general, business persons do not talk as  though they are expecting any worsening in the inflation climate from where we are today. I think there are good reasons to  expect that we can keep the trend core PCE in a range close to1½ percent for the next several years, if we get monetary policy back toward neutral within a reasonable period of time.  At the moment, I think the inflation risk s facing us have shifted from a balanced position toward an  environment in which in flation could gradually creep up over time if we aren’t vigilant.  But I will feel less anxious about this imbalance of risks if we move the fed funds rate up today and continue to do so for a while, at  a pace in tandem wi th the expansion and consistent with getting po licy back toward neutral.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, the Tenth Distri ct economy has contin ued to expand at a very solid pace since the last mee ting.  The labor market  shows substantial signs  of improvement.  The District’s employment rose in May, and I thin k the numbers in June ar e also very strong, and jobs are above year-ago levels in all seven of our  states.  Manufacturing activity rose in May, and the preliminary numbers coming in for June are very solid.  Production and new orders continue to increase, and most plant ma nagers that we talk ed with reported that their rates of capacity utilization were back to pre-recession levels.  Expectations are that activity during  the second half of the year is likely to cool somewhat but will still be at historical leve ls.  Year-over-year production and new 104 of 203  orders indexes actually are setting new highs in our region as we move through June.  Consumer spending continues to rise at a moderate pace.  Retaile rs report steady gains in sales, and we are optimistic about the summer outlook.   Housing activity also  remains strong.  So  far, home sales and homebuilding have shown little advers e effects from the in creases in mortgage rates we’ve seen to date.  Energy activity has continued to expand in response to the high oil and gas prices, and actually some drilling has be en constrained because of the shortage of labor in that particular sector.  Commercial real estate, as others have reported, remains our weak spot as well. On the inflation front,  wage pressures remain constrained in the region, but manufacturers are continuing to raise output prices in respon se to what they say ar e higher energy and raw materials costs that they feel th ey need to pass on.  Most manufacturers do  expect these costs to moderate; however, many of  them are now telling us that the strong demand has made it easier for them to increase pr ices and to have the increases hold. Turning to the national outlook, the economy obviously continues to expand at a solid pace. We expect that GDP growth will be around 4¾ percent this year and just slightly below 4 percent next year.  The important point, I think, is that th e continued strong growth largely reflects the fact that we have an accommodative monetary policy and a stimulative fiscal po licy and that strong growth around the world is  facilitating growth in our GDP.  The slowdown in growth that we’re projecting for next year is related, of course, to some back-off in fiscal  policy and a presumed tightening in mo netary policy. Let me talk a bit about inflatio n.  Core inflation, as we all know, has increased.  Although we talk about important tr ansitory elements to that  increase, I still think that  the core price indexes now have embedded in them some inflationary updrift that is due to our earlier accommodative  monetary policy.  And while fiscal policy may back off, it is still going to be stimulative, and we are 105 of 203  going to be in an accommodative policy stance for some  time.  So as I think about policy going forward, I would join those who encourage us to have in mind moving ba ck toward neutral at a more deliberate pace and in a very systematic fa shion.  We should move to neutral more quickly and avoid having to go above neut ral later to contain inflation, which I think is now threatening in light of our easy policies in the past.  As far as th e statement is concerned, I think we should be very sparing with our words regarding our likely future policy course .  I’d let the economy define what our future policy will be and no t our words toda y.  Thank you.

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  The Twelfth District economy ga ined momentum in re cent months and is expanding in line with th e nation.  Consumer spe nding rose smartly, and our contacts report that price discounting for a variety of sm all retail items has d eclined as demand has grown.  District housing markets saw strong price appreciation and strong sales.  Some of the sales activity, however, appears to be a response  to anticipated mortgage rate increases, s uggesting that markets will calm down again in subsequent months.  We ar e also seeing a continued general recovery in the manufacturing sector as rapid growth in exports, es pecially to East  Asia, has propelled strong gains in overall output and sales. Job growth has also gained momentum in the West—especia lly outside California, which has lagged a bit in recent  months.  As a result, employers in some areas report that it is getting 106 of 203  harder to find qualified applicants for job op enings.  The mountain region in particular has seen a large increase in job vacancy  rates over the past year and a half, and this has been associated with a pickup in the growth of labor co mpensation relative to th e nation.  In fact, growth in compensation recently has been nearly a percentage point higher in the West th an in the nation.  Such divergences have occurred before, because of regional labor demand shocks, and have disappeared as workers moved into the region to fill those jobs.  Labor co mpensation in the West then returned toward the national pace.  At this point, it is too early to tell whether the recent pickup is transitory, due mainly to such a regional demand shock, or is the leading edge of a trend that will  spread more broadly in the national economy.  Turning to the national economy, our views about the outlook are pretty much in line with the Greenbook.  Recent data sugges t that economic growth in the second half of the year will be reasonably strong, and the most likely outcome over the next couple of years seems to be that the pace of growth will exceed potential, bringing th e economy gradually back to ward full employment.  What is new about the outlook compared with May is the strong employment growth reported for fiscal stimulus wanes, to support the very desira ble projections for economic activity and inflation that are outlined in the Greenbook.  Of cour se, to keep output  from overshooting potential, policy will need to tighten, given its current highly acco mmodative stance.  We th ink a path of the funds rate reasonably close to that curr ently embodied in the fed funds fu tures will be appropriate given what we now know.  Such a path  easily qualifies as measured.  Of course, our views will evolve with unfolding data.   In terms of the inflation outlook, I agree that  rather substantial ri sks remain on both the upside and also the downsid e.  On the upside,  there is the possibility that  the role of transitory 107 of 203  factors—as opposed to mo vements in compensation and productiv ity—in explaining the surprising recent uptick in core inflation is overestimated by the Greenbook.  Th e uptick in core inflation could also affect future wage bargains.  The dollar could fall further, and oil prices could jump or remain elevated.  We have also seen a small uptick in compensation growth, although my reading of the labor market is that there remains a significant amount of slack.  Fi nally, not emphasized in today’s presentation, there is upside potential for inflation if trend productivity grow th falls short of the rather robust rate  that I believe is built in to the Greenbook forecast. However, there are also a number  of downside risks to inflat ion, as the Greenbook and the presentation this morni ng emphasized.  One that David emphasized has been particularly important to us in our analysis—namely, that profit margins ha ve been extraordinarily large and the markup of goods prices over unit labor costs in level terms ha s risen to a new high.  This large markup could return to more normal  levels through falling inflation or through fa ster growth in labor compensation or a combination of the two.  We saw such a run- up and rapid reversion toward normality during the second half of  the 1990s.  Based on our analysis, which is similar to an alternative simulation report ed in the Greenbook, it is quite possible that, if  prices and wages adjust consistent with standard model equations over the next year and a half, th e restraint on inflation could be quite significant.  In any event, the most li kely scenario appears to be that core PCE prices will increase by a little over 1½ percent this year and arou nd 1½ percent in 2005.  I see the risks to this forecast as being rather large, but also the inflation risks seem  roughly balanced.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President McTeer. 

[SECTION]

MR. MCTEER.  The economic expans ion in the Eleventh District  started later and has been somewhat slower than th e U.S. expansion, but remarks from our directors, Beig e Book contacts, 108 of 203  and others suggest that the gap is closing fast.  Th e director reports from our various board meetings in the past few months have been  considerably more upbeat.   Rather than dwell on the ups and downs of di fferent sectors of our regional economy, I’d like to focus on the emerging ps ychology of pricing power.  One of our directors from Houston noted that operating rates in petrochemicals have be en increasing across the board, and in a few of his product lines these operating rate s are approaching their capacity li mits.  He also mentioned that he was amazed at how fast  the turnaround had occurre d.  He then went on to say that his company had raised its prices twice in the month since the prior board meeting an d had encountered little resistance.  In fact, he mentioned that his cust omers expressed surprise that the price increases weren’t bigger.  He added that their resistance to price increas es was minimal b ecause they are confident that they can pass those incr eases along to thei r customers.   I am relating this anec dote because I think it is symptoma tic of the reduced slack we hear about from an increasing number of  contacts.  Many of these business es keep close tabs on capacity utilization not only in their industries  but in those of their suppliers as well.  Th e sense that they are conveying is one of conc ern that the Federal Rese rve’s capacity utilization data may be overstating the degree of unused capacity.  In particular, many of them have mentioned technologically obsolete plant and equipment that may not be brought back on stream.  One of our directors from the high-tech area reported the results of a survey of chief information offi cers.  They indicated a changing outlook for their technology spendi ng in the coming year.  Over the last two years, spending on basic infrastructure, such as maintaining their computer networks, was immune to the economic downturn and accounted for 80 to 90 percent of thei r budgets.  As business has been expanding in recent months, this situation has begun  to change significantl y.  In the second ha lf of the year, they are looking for infrastructure spen ding to compose only about 60 perc ent of their budgets, with the 109 of 203  remaining 40 percent going for new applications and emerging technologies.  He feels this is quite bullish, as the criter ion for investment decisions shifts from “What is the payback period?” to “What do we have to do to stay compe titive?”  This shift in attitude may re flect the realization that the recent return to improved pricing power will pr ove to be a short-lived  phenomenon and that boosting productivity and effective capacity is the way to deal with the growing demand.   As I look at the national economy, I find myse lf in general alignmen t with much of the changes and the broad contours  of the staff forecast fo r this year.  When I sent  in my projections last projection for this year is somewhat  higher than the Greenb ook’s and for next year it is considerably higher.  The difference probably reflects my reli ance on anecdota l information and stories about capacity constraints and the implic ations for the overall amount of slack reso urces in the economy. One of our economists tr ied to simulate what the Federal Reserve’s ca pacity utilization rate for manufacturing would look  like if it incorporat ed the utilization numbers from the ISM survey.  While they are admittedly different series and different conc epts of capacity utilization, the simulation does suggest that the Fed’s measure may be on the low side  by several percentage points.  Even if the true number lies somewhere in the middle, it would underscore the anecdotes we’re hearing about how fast excess cap acity is disappearing.  As for the main risks to the economic outlook over the next year and a ha lf, I feel the staff covered them pretty well in their choice of alternative simulation scen arios.  From my point of view, the main risks involve some combination of the “less room to grow,” “higher inflation expectations,” and “s urging demand” scenarios.  The policy implications of this combination of risks—and the baseline forecast as we ll—are pretty clear.   110 of 203  As I indicated at our May meeting, I believe that the inflation risks are unambiguously on the upside and that we ar e behind the curve.  Given recent inflation data, we would have to raise the funds rate by at least ½ point just to avoid in creasing the amount of pol icy accommodation we are already providing.  Howe ver, we are committed to a measured step of ¼ poi nt today.  But we do need to acknowledge the unbalanced upside risk to inflation and drop the term “measured” in order to reclaim some flexib ility going forward.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  The expansion in the Ninth District is broadly based.  It has accelerated recently,  and we’re hearing scattered reports  of labor availability issues in select locations.  With the improvement in employment, conversations and concerns about offshore outsourcing have diminished, as one would expe ct.  Among the sectors that are strong are manufacturing, mining, energy, and agriculture.  Housing constructi on remains a source of strength as well, although the inventory of unsold homes appears to be build ing in some major locations; and nonresidential construction is starting to improve, albeit off a low base.  Consumer spending was strong earlier in the spring.  Recent reports have  been more mixed, and th at has been attributed essentially to lousy weather.  We will see whether or not that in fact turns out to  be the case as we get additional information.  As far as prices are c oncerned, reports are continuing to  come in about both current and prospective price increases.  Clearly, as  I’ve said before, th ere’s more going on there than I had an ticipated earlier. As far as the national economy is  concerned, like almost ever ybody else I think the outlook for growth in the national economy is unquestionably favorable.  My  own forecast is  for modestly higher real growth both this year and next than in the staff forecast.  The differences aren’t large.  It seems to me that the fundamentals for growth ar e clearly positive.  Maybe equally important or 111 of 203  even more so, earlier uncertainties about employ ment gains have diminished, as have earlier uncertainties about the global recovery.   I do expect inflation to remain  low, but not as low as I prev iously anticipated.  And I do think there is an obvious danger in attributing the acceleration we ’ve seen in inflation to temporary or one-off factors.  In any event, given the conf idence intervals that were  presented in the chart show and in the Greenbook, it does n’t seem to me to be  a stretch to expect core inflation to be 2 percent this year and ev en a bit higher next year.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman. I’m going to talk  primarily about conversations I’ve had with those on my standard list of contacts.  My Wal-Mart contact said that June sales had come in a bit weaker than  anticipated, which I think was widely reported in the pres s.  His estimate for sales growth in June is now in the 2 to 4 percent range, an d the company had be en expecting 4 to 6 percent.  He attributes the weak ness in June as due primarily to c ool weather in many parts of the country, which has reduced sales of seasonal supplies like air conditione rs and that  kind of thing.  Wal-Mart’s estimate for sales gr owth going forward is 3 to 5 pe rcent.  My Wal-Mart contact reported to me resu lts from a recent Gallup  poll of consumer attitude s that I think Wal-Mart commissions Gallup to do on a regul ar basis.  Number 1 on the list of concer ns was rising gasoline prices, cited by 23 percent of the sample.  Numbers 2,  3, and 4 were health care, the general economy, and fear of war.  Nu mber 5 was unemployment—fear of  job loss—with the portion of respondents mentioning th at down to only 13 percent of the sample compared wi th 26 percent a couple of months ago.  Th at was quite a dramatic chan ge in attitudes on that issue.  He  also said that general merchandise prices are s till falling slightly but less rapidly than in  the past; the buyers believe that most price increases for this year are already in place.   The figures I mentioned earlier 112 of 203  were for same-store sales. Wal-Ma rt continues with expansion plans to add about 8 percent per year in square footage, which is unchanged from earlie r expectations.  That mean s that their hiring plans reflect about 8 percent employment growth for the company.   My contact notes that they have had no problem finding sales associates.  About 80 percent of their labor force is full-tim e, whereas it’s usually about 60 percent—the cons equence of very low turnover in  their labor force.  So labor supply is plentiful.   As for the transportation industry , my contact at FedEx said th at his firm has very strong earnings—“incredibly strong” was the term he use d.  FedEx is projecting a 25 percent increase in earnings for fiscal ’05, which ends on May 31, 2005, over fisc al ’04.  He attribut es about one-half of the increase in earnings to gains in volume, about one-quarter to pricing, and one-quarter to cost-management and productivity.  FedE x business outbound from Asia to th e rest of the world is up at an 18 percent rate in the fiscal quarter ending May 31—that ’s on a year-over-year basis—while outbound traffic from the United Stat es is up 8 percent.  That’s quite a dramatic change because U.S. outbound shipments had been ve ry, very low.  U.S. ground business is up about 12 percent.  Fed Ex has seen a substa ntial increase in its frei ght business, which is le ss than its truckload shipments.  My contact said that  demand is incredibly high and it’s basically across the board—including retail and manuf actured parts that are going into th e production chain— and across the board geographically.  FedEx is ope rating at capacity in its freigh t business and will be increasing its capital expenditures by 20 to 30 percent in fisc al year ’05 over fiscal year ’04.  Only about 10 percent of that is replacement investment, and the rest is capacity ex pansion.  I think the expansion will improve grow th in the express busi ness—the high priced bus iness, which had been lagging because it was being replace d by ground shipments.   FedEx is anticipating growth in the express component of its business.  That grew 2 percent in the last  quarter, which was the highest 113 of 203  growth they’ve seen in five years.  The company is expecting to add capacity in the United States to handle the rapid growth in intern ational business.  My contact not ed that traffic exiting China was up 50 percent in the last year, and he sees very strong momentum to growth  there.  He has heard reports of inconsistent rail serv ice.  Apparently one of the re asons some shipments are being diverted to air delivery is because of problems in the rail network. My UPS contact said that the economy is changing—“shifting into higher gear” is the way he put it.  Outbound Asia volume is  exceeding expectations.  Business in Europe is not as strong but is also exceeding expecta tions, as is U.S. traffic, both inbo und and outbound.  He described volume as well above expectations everywhere.  He said that the express business,  both for households and businesses, is strong.  He indicated that the grow th in business demand fo r express may reflect the very lean inventory situation.  He reported that internatio nal capacity is very tight.  UPS is replacing smaller aircraft with  larger ones.  He said that they are in negotiatio ns with the pilots’ union.  Apparently the contract expired in  December, and they’re in mediatio n.  The pilots are asking for a 40 percent first-year pay increase, and UPS is offeri ng 6 percent.  So they’re pretty far apart.  My UPS contact also indicated that they are anticipa ting some problems in obtaining part-time workers in the very busy fourth-quarter period.  And they are expecting a very large turnover in their labor force in the next five years due to  retirements of pilots and mechan ics.  To give you an idea about their expectations for volume in the high-demand f ourth-quarter period, they are expecting to lease twenty-nine aircraft just for that peri od compared with th irteen last year. My contact in the trucking industry, from J.B. Hunt, said that he viewed the economy as not hot but warm.  Business has been  up and down.  He didn’t qu ite understand some of the fluctuations, but a noticeable improve ment really took hold in the late fall.  He said that Hunt trucking volume in the intermodal business—t hat’s the piggyback rail business—was up 15 to 114 of 203  17 percent from April to May.  He indicated that so me of that might have been related to problems with Union Pacific.  Th e railroad reported to hi m that they had misjudged the strength of the economy and were short in manpower  and equipment, and they believe it will take the rest of this year for them to catch u p.  He also reported that CSX has had service problems.  Pricing is pretty strong on the truck side .  Prices are up about 7 percent year over year, and maybe 2 percentage points of that is fuel surcharges.  Also, the supply of drivers is extremely tight.  A Wall Street contact said that he believes th e general view on Wall Street is that the Fed has gotten behind the curve and will be looking very carefully at the inflation reports going forward.  As for my view of the national economy, I thin k there is a very solid upward momentum to real activity.  It appears to me that transpor tation demand has taken a lot of the companies by surprise.  That’s my interp retation.  On inflation, my best guess is a modest increase of a few tenths rather than the modest decrease pr ojected by the staff.  In terms of point estimates, that probably represents half a standard deviation.  So the projections are not very far apart—probably half a standard error apart—in terms of th e accuracy of the forecast.  But I also believe that the inflation risks are quite substantially skewed to the upside over the next few quarters.  And I would note that what’s going to happen in the next few quarters is largely independent of any current policy inflation, and that’s a ri sk to us.  Thank you.

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Th e economic expansio n in our Southeast region remains solid.  Recent developments in retail sales, autos, housing, t ourism, travel, banking, and manufacturing have all been po sitive, and I will not go through a discussion of each individual sector.  The main weaknesses remain in nonresid ential construction an d chemicals.   115 of 203  Most relevant to our policy discussion this ti me has been the emergence of imbalances in certain sectors that are generating  significant price increases.  Fo r example, shortages of steel and cement, as well as rising prices in other building materials, are clearly affecting big projects in Florida where bids are either being revised up or  in some cases builders are walking away from projects.  The price of concrete is up 10 percent, with additional increases expected to come.  At a breakfast meeting last we ek, the developer of a la rge high-rise downtown Atlanta residential project told me that the job he had priced last fall now  looks to be coming in at a cost almost 10 percent higher because of rising prices of  various construction materials.  We heard reports of wholesalers, contractors, and machine tool companies stocking up on concrete, st eel, plywood, and sheetrock, if the materials are available, in or der to avoid future price increas es and potential shortages.  One Florida contractor reported holding a three-month i nventory of steel to limit the effects of higher future costs.  A shortage of truck drivers beca use of both higher demand for transporta tion and new driver regulations is not only increasing shipping  costs but also reportedly causing some firms to begin to carry larger inventories than previously. I’m getting more and more  reports of the ability to pass th rough higher input prices to final consumers.  Let me cite just a few examples.  I’ve h eard numerous reports of companies imposing fuel surcharges withou t customer compla ints.  Those reports have come from UPS, a waste-management company, a concrete company in South Florida, a nurs ery, an agricult ural food and supply company, a traile r manufacturer in Tenne ssee, an auto s eat manufacturer in Alabama, a lumber company in Florida, and numerous small trucking an d delivery companies.  A box manufacturer indicated that  he had passed along a severe 10 percent increase in paper prices with little resistance, an d he’s set to raise prices again in September.  In Fl orida, small grocery stores, hotels, and restaurants report raisin g prices without resist ance in light of strong demand and higher 116 of 203  food and energy input prices.  Te nnessee hotels and resort s are also raising prices for the first time in years because of stro ng demand.  Fast food companies are reporting chicken supply problems because of the trucking shortage I mentioned prev iously.  Supply problems coupled with increased demand in retail poultry markets have reportedly led some grocery stores to tell their poultry suppliers to “nam e their price.”  Finally, many personal service firms—barbers, spas, et cetera—in Florida are raising prices wi th little resistance.  At the same time, it  is important to no te that we also have many other reports of firm s absorbing input price increases because of  competition, weak demand, or the hope that many of the increases will  prove to be transitory.  Nevertheless, over the last several months, ther e have been far more stories of pric e increases and higher costs that are being passed along than we have heard in many years. At the national level, I think we  have to be pleased and reassured with the new real side data, which have been quite positiv e overall.  And as one of the earlier skeptics about the likelihood of robust near-term job growth, I find the two strong employment re ports since our last meeting to be really good news.  The Greenbook as well as  other forecasters are su ggesting that GDP growth will be in excess of 4 percent in 20 04, with inflation stabili zing in 2005 to a rate  below that of 2004.  The distinguishing factor between the Greenbook a nd many other forecasts is  that few of the latter have the Greenbook’s particular  combination of reasonably st rong real GDP growth, benign inflation, and low unemployment together with a low path for the federa l funds rate.  If the Greenbook forecasts are seen by the Committee as  adequately representing  our beliefs about the future, then are we in f act forecasting that the ec onomy will soon return to the path it was on in the late 1990s?  Perhaps.  But I se e the underlying fundamentals as being different this time, and different enough to suggest that the longer-term inflatio n risk may be higher than some believe. 117 of 203  I suggested at our last meeting that our focus sh ould be on the best path for future policy and not just on the first rate increase.  I’ve been  anxious, and still am, to get started with an early process of removing the extraordin ary policy accommodation th at is no longer needed.  Recent inflation and inflation expectations data—and the anecdotal reports we’ve shared th is morning—seem to underscore the need to get started with our policy adjustme nt, even allowing for the fact that some portion of the price increases we’re seeing will turn out to be transitory .  My concern about the future path of policy has been reinforced by our discus sions yesterday afternoon about the underlying imbalances of the so-called twin deficits  that we are now experiencing.  This heightens my belief that we ma y well find that we will need  to be on a steeper rate path than we have been seeing in many of our simulations.  Specifically, wh at are some of the more troublesome underlying fundamentals I’m talking about?  Consumer debt and househol d financial obligat ions, while a bit off their peak levels, are still much greater than in the 1990s.  And the gove rnment fiscal situation now shows deficits that are larger and likely to continue to grow, es pecially since I don’t see either tax or spending policies mo ving to correct them in the near future.  Finally, as we discussed yesterday, we have a gr owing and unsustainable current account deficit.  These factors point to higher levels of consumption and aggregate demand and suggest that a neutral funds rate may be somewh at higher than some project, espe cially at the present rates of productivity.  If I am correct, then we run the risk of pursuing a more accommodative monetary policy than we intend, with the likely outcome bei ng a higher rate of inflation than expected.  There’s a temptation to downplay the risk I’m raising.  Afte r all, the U.S. economy has functioned quite well with low inflation rates and with a negative real short-term rate, and some see continued resource slack as taking pressure off prices.  But I suggest, given the recent combination of expansive fiscal and moneta ry policies, that our low inflation rate is most li kely the consequence of 118 of 203  heavy support for the dollar provid ed from abroad and a willingness on the part  of foreigners to invest in this country, compensati ng for the low U.S. saving rate. History, as well as theory, suggests that large current acc ount deficits should be self-correcting through downward adjustments in our exchange rates, upward adjustments to real interest rates, a reduction in domestic co nsumption relative to production, and an increase in private and public savings.  All of this was discussed yesterda y.  What I think makes th e orderly transition of this imbalance especially difficult and problematic is  the posture of current U. S. fiscal policy, which is not oriented toward reeling in the deficit, combined with the tr ade and exchange rate policies of other countries—China and Japan to name just tw o.  These countries are pursuing policies they perceive to be in their own short-term interest.  That is, they are either running persistent current account surpluses or maintaining an  overvalued currency through cu rrency intervention aimed at fixing their exchange rates relativ e to the dollar.  While this may help foster domestic growth in those countries, it also has the e ffect of enabling risky fiscal behavior on the part of the United States, while postponing the day of reckoning for all. Obviously, the Federal Reserve can’t deal with  trade or foreign exch ange policies, nor can we engineer a return to a more sustainable world ec onomy by ourselves.   In this respect, the conduct of monetary policy becomes more di fficult.  What I believe we ca n and should do is  to move the path of monetary policy back towa rd a more neutral position.  And the sooner we be gin and actually get there, the lower the adju stment cost will be for th e United States and for the rest of the world.  If we wait too long before acting, then the more aggr essive path we would have  to pursue to catch up carries increased risk, given the leverage in the co nsumer sector.  Moreover , by falling behind the curve we risk the likelihood of additional pressure on the dolla r, contributing even more to international imbalances.  Finally,  like President Yellen, I am more comfortable with the funds rate 119 of 203  path embedded in financial markets than I am with  the more modest adjustments reflected in the Greenbook baseline. And like severa l others, I hope we can find language for our statement that unties our hands to do what is suggested by developments as they unfold.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. LACKER.  In the Fifth Dist rict, the economic reco very appears to have strengthened in recent weeks.  Shipments and new orders are up, and there are spot  reports of increased export demands in Europe and China, particularly for some  niche technology produc ts.  Despite the slower pace of output growth, employmen t in manufacturing has increased on net in Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina but cont inues to fall in North Ca rolina, with its heavy c oncentration of textile, apparel, and furniture plants.  For the District as a whole,  I get the sense that manufacturing employment is expanding even more slowly than in the nation.   Outside of manufacturing, however, hiring is de finitely picking up.  In fact, several of our contacts are reporting signs of emerging tightness in  labor markets. Consistent with these reports, our diffusion index for District manufacturing wages pick ed up sharply this month.  Our survey reports also indicate that the pace of material s price increases eased so mewhat in May and June, although firms c ontinue to complain about hi gher prices for selected co mmodities such as steel and concrete. Retailers are reporting moderately higher revenue s, but they say that sales growth in early growth seems to have accelerated in recent weeks.   Commercial Realtors have reported a moderate uptick in retail leasing activity rece ntly, but office and industrial l easing remains sluggish overall.  120 of 203  Residential construction is still  quite strong in our District, and now we are ge tting consistent reports of strong commercial loan demand. Consistent with the evidence from the Fifth District, the re covery of the national economy appears to be deepening and broadening, particularly in business sp ending and hiring.  I think we have every reason to expect to ma intain this traction and to see a well-balanced expansion take hold in the quarters ahead.  The Greenbook projects real GDP to  grow at around 5 percent for the remainder of ’04 and to slow to the rate of pote ntial growth thereafter, closing the estimated output gap by early ’06.  This project ion seems quite reasonable to me. Headline inflation has been running higher th an we would like over the last couple of months, but for several re asons it seems plausible that this recent increase  will turn out to be transitory.  The output  gap is still si zable.  The markup of prices over unit labor costs, as we discussed earlier, is well above its long-run average, and given that, it seems most likely to decline.  Inflation expectations seem to be  reasonably well anchored.  Moreove r, year-over-year  increases in measured consumer inflation are still moderate.  For ex ample, core PCE infl ation on a year-over-year basis remains inside the 1 percent to 2 percen t range consistent with price stability.   On the other hand, short-run inflation expe ctations have moved up in recen t months together with actual inflation, and financial market me asures of inflation compensation at longer horizons have drifted higher as well.  Moreover, as the Greenbook notes, market-based inflation expectations appear to be sensitive to declarations of the FO MC’s resolve to hold the line on infl ation.  The fact  that the path of the fed funds rate expected by market participants exceeds the baseline path assumed in the Greenbook can be interpreted, as I read it, as evidence that financial markets continue to be nervous about upside inflationary  risk.  The market’s reaction to Mond ay’s inflation figures bolsters that notion, I think. 121 of 203  All in all, though, I think we po sitioned ourselves reasonably well coming into th is meeting.  The labor market recovery is on track, inflation seems likely to moderate in the near term, and for monetary policy in coming months will be gauging the speed with which we need to increase interest rates to hold the line on inflation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Developments since our last meeting support a reasonable degree  of confidence in the strength  of the expansion and somewhat more concern about the ou tlook for inflation.  Th e economy of the Second District seems to have strengthened further.  Em ployment is growing very rapidly, and re tail sales have been strong even in the face of the softer national numbers.  Our su rvey of manufacturers sh ows persistently strong readings, with even more optimis m six months out.  Credit dema nd seems to be gr owing.  Core inflation in the region has fall en off a bit but remains well ab ove the national average.  The anecdotal story in the Di strict suggests a continued ability to pass on co st increases and growing pressure to raise comp ensation to attract an d retain workers with  the requisite skills. At the national level, we thin k the fundamentals support c ontinued strength in demand growth at a comfortable, if somewhat softer, rate .  High levels of report ed consumer confidence, strong income growth, and more-rapid gains in employment should support reasonably healthy growth in consumption.  Investment seems likely to have ample reason an d room to continue to grow at a rapid rate, with corporate balance sheets strong, profit margins strong, i nventories low, and orders running high.  We think foreign demand looks pretty positive, to o, but not strong enough to avoid a significant negative contributio n from net exports th is year and next. 122 of 203  On the assumption that  monetary policy roughly tracks the present path of market expectations, we project GDP grow th of about 4½ percent in real terms this year and somewhat under 4 percent in ’05.  We see the risks to this path as balanced, with the principal downside risks coming from the strategic realm rather than the econ omic—strategic in terms of a terrorist event or a major oil supply shock.   On the economic side, the principal risks seem  likely to come from a more substantial slowdown  in household spending, a sharp re duction in near-term or expected productivity growth, or a sharp decline in the willi ngness of nonresidents to  acquire U.S. financial assets. We are somewhat more concerned about the inflatio n outlook.  We have now seen significant acceleration in underlyi ng inflation to a level somewhat above our range of comfort.  We face some risk that a mode st increase in inflation expectations—even after the recent moderation of those expectations—will feed through to higher compensation gr owth.  The extent of the swing in unit labor costs, the various indications of supplie r delays despite high reported capacity numbers, and the persistent reports of pricin g power all suggest a patte rn of inflation dynami cs that is hard to reconcile with the degree of slack we thought we had perceived in the economy. So we have raised our inflatio n forecast for core PCE a bit to 1¾ percent for ’04, with a somewhat lower rate in ’05.  It stays below 2 percent in  part because we stil l assume a reasonably substantial monetary policy response that is effective in containing expectations, in part because we believe oil and commodity prices will start to brin g down the headline numbers, and in part because we still think produc tivity growth is goin g to be reasonably high.  All those factors, combined with high profit margins, strong comp etitive pressures, and an  expected gradual pace in the absorption of remaining slack in the labor  market, work to contain inflation going forward.  But we think the risks to that forecast may be somewhat to the upside.  Or if we want to say the risks are balanced, we 123 of 203  think they are balanced around a higher path for underlying infl ation and a higher bulge in the near term.   The uncertainty in the outlook reinforces the case for underscoring our commitment to do what is necessary to contain the risks to our objective of price stability.  The costs of being perceived as too complacent about underlying infl ation probably are now gr eater to us than the alternative.  Now that we’ve reac hed the point where we need to be gin to move to a more neutral fed funds rate, we take some co mfort from the fact that financia l markets seem reasonably well prepared for the beginning of this  transition.  The things we can measure as well as the anecdotal reports from a broad range of financial intermediari es suggest, as the Boar d staff now concludes, that the anticipated change in th e fed funds rate will not cause a lot of collateral damage or be accompanied by a lot of volatility amplifying position adjustments an d hedging.  But there’s a lot we cannot measure and cannot know  about how the world will react to the initiation of what will have to be a substantial in crease in the fed funds rate over time, after a very long peri od of low rates, and we’re likely to enco unter some surprises even  if they are no t systemic in their magnitude. We are reasonably comfortable w ith the extent of the tightenin g that is now priced in, and we are pleased with how responsive  those expectations have been both to the stronger data and the higher inflation numbers.  However, the path of e xpectations still suggests a reason ably high degree of confidence that we wi ll move in only 25 basis point increm ents.  I don’t thin k we can be fully confident that we can afford th at gentle a path.  Our signal should aim to qualify further the qualifications we have gradually introduced over the past few meetings and to emphasize that we will act as necessary to ke ep expected inflation low.   We don’t need to try to induce a significantly steeper path for the fed funds rate right now, but it probably would be  helpful if the market built in a 124 of 203  somewhat greater expectation that we could move in larger increments this year if circumstances warranted.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My forecast, like mo st of yours, represents quite a nice outcome for the economy.  I have growth somewhat above the growth of potential, so the output gap cl oses fairly gradually, with the economy reaching full utilization in the latter part of 2005 and core PCE inflation remainin g below 2 percent.  A ll this is accomplish ed in my forecast with an assumed measured pace of tightening.  Like President Yellen, I would include something on the order of what is built into  the market as measured.   I am expecting both slower gr owth and higher inflation this  year than in my January projection.  A number of developments have contributed to this  less favorable configuration, but most prominent among them have been higher prices for energy  and other imported goods and commodities.  These have had the classic effects of  an adverse price shoc k, damping growth and raising prices.  These price increases seem to acc ount for a good portion of the pickup in core inflation.  And the effect on spen dable income of the rising cost of oil and other imports with low short-run demand  elasticities probably has kept demand for domestically pr oduced goods and services from growing as rapidly as it otherwise would.  In part, my relatively sanguine outlook from here reflects my exp ectations that these shocks  won’t be repeated and could even be reversed to a degree.  Oil and commodity prices have come off their highs, as dema nd from China has cooled and consumers and producers have begun to ad just production and cons umption to the higher prices.  As the price shock effects erode, policy stim ulus should show through more to the growth of demand, and inflation should abate.   Next year, the timely erosion of fiscal and financial stimulus help to slow growth, just as th e economy approaches full employment.   And inflation should remain 125 of 203  contained, as continuing though ebbing margins of slack along with elevated profit margins keep Something is sure to go wron g.  The interesting questions revolve around how fast the output gap is likely to close—Is there a danger of overshooting without considerable near-term policy restraint?—and around inflation.  Even if slack disappears gradually, is  stable core inflation a reasonable expectation? On the speed of closure of the output gap, recent information seems to be sending contradictory signs.  Anecdotes—ISM and other business surveys and what we’ve heard around the table today—portray an economy with a considerable head of steam. This im pression is reinforced by the large increases in establishment employment in recent months.  Strong IP and a substantial increase in capacity utiliza tion add to the impression that slack is disappearing  fairly quickly, but an array of other data have s uggested a slower ap proach to high re source utilization.  In the household survey, the un employment rate is unchanged since January, and labor force participation hasn’t risen.  Moreover, the work week, which one might anticipate would strengthen concurrently with or even before  hiring, has barely bu dged off a very low le vel.  GDP itself is estimated to have grown at a 4 percent rate over the first half of the year—a solid pace, as we say in our announcements, but hardly a ba rnburner when structural productiv ity is probably still advancing rapidly.  This estimate of 4 percent includes a leveling-out of consumption in recent months, along with a couple of releases  showing weak orders and shipments that highlight th e solid rather than the ebullient character of the expansion. Going forward, the risks around an expectation of  a fairly gradual decline in slack appear to me to be roughly ba lanced.  In addition to the possibilities of geopolitical oil market developments damping demand, we can’t yet gaug e how spending will respond to the recent rise in intermediate- 126 of 203  and long-term rates.  To be sure , as I already noted, several influe nces were holding back the pace of expansion this year, but 4 pe rcent growth—only moderately abov e the rate of growth of the economy’s potential—doesn’t seem all that strong, given the unusual degree of fiscal and financial stimulus in the latter part of 20 03 and early 2004.  Financial cond itions remain supp ortive of above-trend growth, but they have tight ened in recent months  as markets have come to anticipate our actions.  Household spending woul d seem to be the most vulnerabl e.  The high level of household spending encouraged by low intere st rates over recent years must have borrowed to some extent from future expenditures. On the upside, there is some risk that spreadin g optimism, especially among businesses, could overwhelm the gradual erosion of fiscal and monetary accommodat ion.  With an assumed measured pace of monetary tightening, neither policy turns restrictive next year.  It could be that more of the strength in investment  this year is attributable to underlying demand and less to the anticipation of the expiration of par tial expensing at the end of the y ear.  In this case, we could see more strength in investment persist through early next year than would be consistent with an appreciable moderation in growth. In contrast to my views on the erosion of the output gap, I susp ect, along with many of you, that the risks around my forecast  that core inflation will rema in below 2 percent are not quite balanced.  To be sure, the weight of the experien ce of recent years sugges ts to me that 5.5 or 5.6 percent is above the NAIRU an d that 76.4 percent is below th e sustainable operating rate of manufacturers.  I do not believe that the rate of obsolescence of human or physical capital has accelerated so much that this ex perience is no longer pertinent. Moreover, as I noted, much of the pickup in core inflation this year seems to be explainable by one-time price-level adjustments; and long-term  inflation expectations  really haven’t moved 127 of 203  much, on balance, even as  short-term expectations rose substantially.  Still, there is much we do not understand about the inflation process, as David wa s careful to point out th is morning.  And the pickup in core inflation has been a surprise to me .  The output gap is an unobservable construct— inferred from the behavior of other variables li ke prices and compensation—with considerable imprecision.  And the extent of th e slack in the staff forecast isn’t that large.  He nce we need to watch the inflation data carefully,  and until I see some evidence that  confirms my e xpectation that the recent rate of increase of co re CPI and PCE inflatio n will stabilize and even  moderate at least a little, the risk would seem to be on the side of higher inflation than my forecast. My preference for the next part of this meeting would be not only to remove some of the accommodation of policy but also to  find the combination of words that reflects both the central tendency of expectations of a me asured pace of policy tightening and the recognition that, in these circumstances, the Committ ee must be alert to the possibility that it coul d need to take more-likely outcome, I think inclusio n of these words in our announcement do es convey useful information.  With that language in place over the last few months, reactions  in financial markets to incoming data have been substantial and sensible.  I do not think that ma rkets are interpreting “measured pace” as an unconditional commitment.  Retentio n of this language along with a statement underlining our commitment to doing what is necessary to maintain  price stability would not materially, in my  view, constrain our actions  in the future.  If we  do omit reference to a measured pace, we will need to rethink the balance of risks sentence.  If we keep its present configuration or the suggested co nfiguration in which the risks are balanced  for both output and inflation, standing alone, that conveys essentia lly nothing about the Comm ittee’s concerns and its intentions.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 128 of 203

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I read from the polls and the market surveys that it is a “slam dunk” or, to us e another analogy that has been in the news lately, a “gimme putt” that the Fed will start rais ing rates at this meeting.   That issue seems hardly worth discussing.  What is on everybody’s mind is  how fast and how far ra tes will rise and whether the Fed is behind the curve. For all the market chatter that the Fed is behind  the curve, I frankly fi nd it surprisingly hard to see much supporting macro evid ence.  Starting with the models, the Greenbook has the funds rate increasing by 2 percentage  points over the next six quarters, a mo ve of roughly 25 basis points in two-thirds of our meetings over th e period.  This pace is distinctly below wh at almost every market commentator is talkin g about and below the Fed f unds futures curve, and it still leaves the funds rate well below equilibriu m at the end of 2005.  I would have thought that su ch an approach would be too little, too late, and would let inflation start increasi ng.  In fact, at least in  the models, it conforms remarkably well with wh at the Bluebook calls a “perfect foresight” path, under which the long-run inflation and unemployment outlooks conform quit e closely to my normativ e targets.  By this standard, at any rate, th e Fed doesn’t seem to be  behind the curve.  But those are just models. Broadly speaking, there are two relationships th at could go awry in these simulations.  The first involves what is being called the pass-through issue.  Whatever the over all rate of utilization, because exogenous prices or expectations have in creased, inflation could ri se—at least for a time.  What exogenous prices?  One is commodity prices, but these have been shown to have a small effect on overall prices and have already started turn ing down.  Another is oil prices.  While there is still significant uncertain ty about the Middle East , the staff has made a calculation that even removing the entire Iraqi oil output from the mark et would raise overall co re PCE inflation only a 129 of 203  few tenths of a percent.  Moreover, the staff’s demand–supply an alysis makes it as likely that oil prices and futures prices will fall as rise .  Non-OPEC oil supply has tu rned out to be increasing faster than demand, and indeed, oil prices have back ed off recently.  A third is the dollar, which of course we discussed extensively yesterday.  There’s not much more to be said  about that except that in a lot of scenarios that adjustme nt doesn’t come with a whole lot of inflationary potential for the economy.  As for inflationary expect ations, the short-term measures have indeed risen, but slightly.  However, as has been noted by se veral people, price markups are also  very high, and they could put downward pressure on overall pri ces.  At a time with as much uncertainty as now, it is always possible that inflation will rise th rough this pass-through channel, but  a careful look at the evidence actually leads me to have substantial doubts about that. The other possibility for a rise in  inflation involves th e fact that output gaps  may not be as large as the staff thinks.  Of cour se, they may not be, but to me ther e is plenty of evidence that the present 5.6 percent rate of employment does not represent full capacity ec onomywide.  First, of course, I can remember  a few years ago when  the unemployment rate went to 4 percent with no real hint of acceleration in inflation.   Second, employment as  measured by the employer survey is still well below its peak, and as Don just noted, labo r force participation is low,  and the workweek is still very low.  Wages have in creased a bit but have not really accelerated.  And unit labor costs are still low, though picking up a bit.  The whole picture does not look  to me like one of overfull macroeconomic capac ity, and I still find myself reasonably comfortable with a NAIRU in the neighborhood of 5 percent. Considering the pass-through channel and th e output channel togeth er, somewhat to my surprise the inflation risks really  do seem somewhat balanced to me.  This is, of course, exactly what the FOMC has been saying for a time now.  As Kissinger once said, “The statement has the 130 of 203  added advantage that it actu ally seems to be true.”  [Laughter]  As a best guess, I’m still  comfortable with the main strategy of a grad ual increase in rates starting now and at every meeting or so.  But we do have to worry about more than best guesses.  As  I said last time, I’m  still nervous on the upside partly because of the unha ppy and haunting experience of the ’70s.  The logic may have looked as though infl ation would not get out of control then either, but it  did.  So I still think we have to be ready to activate Plan B—a more rapid rise in rates, which we can put into effect if future data reports and other indications start suggesting th at inflation really does seem to be truly ramping up.  Such a Plan B would al ert the market now to the fact that, if we do seem  to be falling behind the inflation curve, somehow or other the gradual pace will give way, and we’ll raise rates more rapidly.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  During the inte rmeeting period I have been struck mainly by the surprises that have come in.  Unfortunate ly, this time around the surprises have been somewhat contradictory.  We have alread y had some discussion of what the downside surprises have been, so let me try to be fairly brief.   The first, obviously, wa s that first-quarter real GDP growth was revised down about ½ percentage  point.  In addition, the new orders and shipments data in May, wh ile strong, were weaker than expecte d, and the staff has already indicated how that affected their thinking.  More recent ly, consumer spending, while also strong, was noticeably weaker than e xpected.  And finally, if one does a quick review of the Greenbooks over this year, it is clear that, for almo st every forecast round, the staff has been revising down its outlook for both 2004 and 2005. So, why this litany of downside surprises for the real economy?  It is not because I doubt that the economy is on a self-sustaining growth path.  I do not .  Other elements of the economy—in 131 of 203  particular, strong job growth an d consumer confidence —seem poised to provide the underpinnings for momentum in the economy.  An d perhaps this short list of downside surprises only reminds us that economic growth does not fo llow a smooth monthly or quarterly pattern.  However, I must admit that this pattern of  downside surprises leav es me with some concern that the path of the economy may be shallower than originally though t and perhaps even some what below the growth rate of potential.  But, as I think Don and Ned both  indicated, the fact that the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, and the capacity utilization rate have a ll remained st ubbornly low or high—depending on ho w you think about it—suggests that, indeed, we are not closing the gap as rapidly as some had feared.  This recent softness and this shallower path out of 2004 and into 2005 are somewhat worrisome to me because they se em to be emerging just at a point when fiscal policy is falling back from noticeably s timulative to slightly contractiona ry.  So in short, at least in comparison to the original Gr eenbook projection, I put much more weight on the downside possibilities, and therefor e I’m more comfortable with the ne w forecast the staff presented this morning. Now obviously, on the other side of this surprise index, ther e have been su rprises on the upside with respect to inflation.  I find these surprises not te rribly troublesome in that I think we still are most likely to end up being in what I would desc ribe as the zone  of price stabilit y.  But I must admit that we’re probably at the upper end of that zone at this stage.  What is probably more troubling about these surprises on inflation is that they are relatively hard to explain.  There are some who argue that the real surprises on inflation were so lo w last year that we are now just dealing with the natural catch-up.  Many argue that  the pass-through for oil, commodity prices, and import prices in general is higher than historical  norms, though we saw ye sterday that some would argue that we are simply returning to the norm.  Finally, some wo uld use the upside surprises in 132 of 203  inflation to argue that the most commonly held view of inflatio n dynamics—namely, that inflation pressures remain subdued as long as resources are slack—is wrong.  Others looking at th e same set of data would argue that we real ly don’t have a very good unders tanding of slack resources or how large the slack is in the economy.  In any event, while I think that inflation is not yet a pressing danger, we clearly must consider  for the first time in a long time an upsid e risk as well as a downside risk around our core  or baseline forecast.  These surprises also remind us how unfortunately little we kno w about inflation dynamics, as I th ink the staff indicated in their presentation.  The models that we have on price level changes I think have an r2 of somewhere around 0.5 or 0.6, sugges ting that humility in this regard, as with other thin gs, is very important. So very briefly, recognizing the time, what are the implicat ions of these surprises and uncertainties for monetary policy?  As Ned has already indicated, we’re obviously about to embark on a phase of tightening.  That is an action I will fu lly support.  Policy rate s are clearly too low for an economy that is growing as ou rs obviously is.  And as the ec onomy normalizes, the policy rate should also normalize.  However, given the uncertainties that I at least feel about the outlook for both price stability and output stability, I would enc ourage us to follow a ve ry pragmatic path.  I believe we should make as few changes as possibl e in the general message we have been sending, while maintaining our cred ibility and our commitm ent to our mission.  We should also continue to hold open the option that we can adju st our plans as incoming data warrant on either side.  Forty years ago, Barry Goldwate r made a comment that I’d  like to use now:  “Gra dualism in the face of uncertainty is no vice.  Undu e haste in defense of credibility is no virtue .”  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. 133 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic  growth is increasingly becoming broad- based and, I believe, sustainable.  Capital expenditures, whose curtai lment was the cause of the last recession, are strong.  Empl oyment growth in the last several mont hs has really come back to life.  And manufacturing is showing real  strength for the first time, with rising capacity utilization and employment growth for four consecutive months.  Retail sales continue to grow solidly.  And inventories, while increasing, con tinue to be well managed by comp anies as inventory–sales ratios drop to new lows every month, which should , in turn, support expa nsion going forward. Corporate profits are up over 31 percent in the last year, and forecasts are for continued strong growth in 2004.  Debt–equ ity ratios for nonfinancial corpora tions continue to improve from their peaks set in the third quarte r of 2002 and are now down to levels  last seen in the 1970s.  Our recent flow of funds data for 2004:Q1 show a fourth straight quar ter of a surplus funding gap for businesses.  Thus, companies have the financial st rength to fund continued expansion internally and to access capital markets and financial institutions for fu nds on favorable terms. Earlier, the Chairman made a comment about the profit shar e of GDP versus GNP, and the staff—Steve in particular—won’t be amazed that that is one of the numbers I tend to  look at over time.  The profit share of the GDP number actually shows a more extrem e peak in profit share.  It hit a seventy-five-year high of 8½ percent of GDP in  the first quarter, and that’s about 2½ points above the long-run average.  Profit share does tend to revert to th e mean over time.  But what does that imply right now?  We know that analysts look ing at individual companie s forecast that earnings per share for 2005 will show a marked slowdown but still growt h.  And they are assuming that companies will have  to absorb more costs th at are not passed  through to cust omers into 2005. Historically, most profit margin  reduction comes through relati vely faster growth of labor costs than prices, and that is reflected in part  in the recent revisions we’ve seen in employee 134 of 203  compensation costs in the fourth quarter of ’03 and the fi rst quarter of this year.  Productivity growth slows as the ex pansion progresses, and competition for workers intensifies as strong employment growth continues.  Those factors and increased compensation to retain the best employees in more-competiti ve labor markets will all likely contri bute to a larger share of income going to labor.  So I am less optimistic on labor costs than the staff forecast. The various inflation measures released sinc e the last FOMC meetin g showed surprising strength.  One of the few indicato rs to improve, the core crude co mponent of the producers’ price index, has now fallen for two months, but that’s after nine mont hs of exceptional increases.  The core CPI eased a bit in May after three months of acceleratio n. While one can point to unusual jumps in prices for it ems such as used cars,  apparel, or lodging,  the list of these exceptions is getting broad enough to ask whether pricing power has returned  in a much wider sense.  So I think this is a time when we need to be especially attentive to the incoming inflation data and make sure we act promptly to limit fu rther acceleration.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Bernanke. MR. BERNANKE.  Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to share with you Meyer’s Rules of Forecasting, as propounded by fo rmer FOMC member and current sensationalist author, Larry Meyer.  [Laughter]  Rule 1, stick with your forecast as long as possible.  Ru le 2, when your forecast becomes untenable, make a new forecast.  Rule 3, k now when to switch from  rule 1 to rule 2.  [Laughter] There’s nothing much needed in terms of change s to our forecast for the real side of the economy, which has thus far evolve d much as this Comm ittee predicted in bo th June 2003 and challenges ahead, we should paus e to take some satisf action in the Federal Reserve’s contribution to 135 of 203  the turnaround.  Our policy ac tions, reinforced by innovation s in our communication strategy, helped provide crucial support to the economy during a dangerous period.  As an aside, there has recently been a bit of re visionism to the effect that our concerns with deflation a year ago were overstated  on the grounds that the official statistics may ha ve in some way exaggerated the true extent of disi nflation.  Understanding last year’s inflation behavior is important but in my view not really relevant to assessing th e extent of the policy challenge the FOMC faced in early 2003.  The most salient fact  about the first half of 2003 was that the economy continued to sputter even as our policy rate de clined to 1 percent.  We thus faced the r eal possibility , whether remote or not, that the funds rate would reach or come close to the zero lower bound, a development that would have greatly complicated our subsequent policymaking.  Avoiding those dangerous waters on the way to robust economic grow th was an important achievement indeed.  Unlike the growth forecast, the inflation fo recast is one to which Meyer’s rules of forecasting may now apply.  I certai nly did not anticipate the pickup in  inflation we have seen in the past few months, and I c ongratulate my colleagues who were more astute th an I in appreciating the early change in the pricing envi ronment.  Given what we have seen in the inflation data, the question now is whether the time ha s come for me to switc h from Meyer’s rule 1 to rule 2.  I wish rule 3 would give more practical guidance on this question!  [Laughter]  The key issue, of course, is whether the recent increase in infl ation portends further increases or  whether it was in stead at least partly temporary.  Thou gh suitably chastened by my recent forecast misses , I guess I can’t help myself.  I’m still inclined to the vi ew that inflation, both headline an d core, is likely to moderate in the second half of the year.  In particular, the st abilization of energy prices —oil prices are now more than 15 percent off their peak—non-energy commodi ty prices, and the dolla r bode especially well for the inflation outlook , though it may be some months before we see th e full effect.   136 of 203  In this respect, I find the decomposition of the recent increase in inflation provided to me by staff member Charles Fleischman a nd similar to the presen tation this morning quite interesting.  Between the second half of 2003 and the first half of 2004, core  PCE inflation increased by a full percentage point at an annual rate .  Of this increase, 0.4 percentage point was accounted for by a rapid acceleration in nonmarket pr ices—i.e., made-up prices, notab ly the infamous deflator for financial services.  With nonmarket  prices excluded, more  than 100 percent of  the acceleration in core PCE inflation between 2003:H2  and 2004:H1 can be acc ounted for by higher inflation or less deflation in goods prices, particularly durable goods  prices.  In contrast, the inflation in services excluding energy, whether inclusive of housing serv ices or not, has actually decelerated in the past six months.  As it seems likely that  goods prices would be relatively more affected by changes in the value of the dollar and in the prices of energy and raw materials, this patter n seems consistent with the inference that the recent increase in inflation is due more to these factors than to a generalized increase in aggregate demand or higher labor costs, for example. Moderation of inflation does require that unit labor costs re main under control.  Labor supply still seems quite el astic.  The fact that the recent addition of more than a million jobs has barely affected the unemployment rate suggests th at many people stand re ady to enter the labor force as conditions improve .  Wage trends are more  difficult to assess.  Compensation  per hour in the nonfarm business sector increase d at a 4.7 percent annual rate in the first quarter, more than we expected.  However, because tota l compensation da ta include such items as retrospective pension payments and the value of exercised stock options, they may overstate the true marginal cost of labor.  At the other extreme, average hourly earni ngs of production worker s, which exclude such items but also exclude other benefits costs such as  health insurance, rose  only 1.9 percent at an 137 of 203  annual rate in the first quarter.  The true growth in marginal cost is no doubt bracketed by these two figures.   All this said, it has been brought  home to me by recent experien ce that inflation forecasts as well as output forecasts are, of course, always hazardous and s eem particularly so  today.  Knowing when to switch from Meye r’s rule 1 to rule 2 is not so easy.  Given these uncertainties, it seems to me that the best tactic fo r us at this juncture is to temporize, embarking on a program of gradual rate increases but remaining alert and ready to ad just in response to incoming information. With respect to communication, I would simply say that I am fairly comfortable with the configuration of expectations about future tightening that is now built into the market.  So if we do change communication, I hope we will be carefu l not to destabilize those expectations unduly.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson.

MR. OLSON.  Thank y ou, Mr. Chairman.  In preparatio n for today, I surveyed three banks—a New York money center bank, a Southeas tern regional bank, and a national bank with a Midwest base and a twenty -four-state footprint.  I came away w ith two strong reactions from those interviews.  The first had to do with asset quality.  Two of my three contacts used phrases like “the best ever” and “getting better.”  In their assessment, as set quality exceeded that  suggested in Steve’s chart show on both the co nsumer and the business sides, and in my judgment it is at a level that also is better than what could be achieved simply by th e application of good cred it standards by banks.  When I pursued this question, the bankers suggested that it is an indication of management discipline.  I think th e same discipline that Sandy Piana lto referred to, wh ich we are seeing throughout the rest of the business co mmunity, is evident also in borrowing. 138 of 203  Moving on to lending activity, fo r most of the past year the se nse of the outlook that I’ve gotten from the banking industry has lagged our forecast in terms of the strength of the recovery.  We have been predicting a recovery  for most of the last year, and yet there was a he sitancy by the bankers to embrace that view, based on what they  picked up in their interactions with their borrowers.  Their expectations no l onger lag ours; for the first time this year it seems to me that they have clearly caught up. My having said that, to date the only significant  lending activity is in commercial real estate.  And the banks that are involved in commercial real estate are those that re ly on an interest rate spread in order to achieve thei r profitability, so it’s the small regionals and the large community banks.  As suggested in the dialogue we had he re between Sue and Steve regarding the potential weakness in that sector, I think developments there certainly bear watching. C&I lending is still soft for all the reasons that we’ve talked about.  Li quidity is strong, and productivity is strong.  The par tial expensing that, on th e one hand, is increasing the incentives for investing is also providing increasing cash flow for debt service, which is perhaps postponing the need for borrowing.  Taking all things into consid eration, however, busine ss confidence seems to have fully recovered.  The partia l expensing will provide an additional incentive for the second half of the year.  And simply based on  the responses of my contacts in the banking industry, it seems to me that there will clearly be incr eased activity from the banking sect or in the second  half of 2004. In terms of where we are today, we have signaled in our communications a sequence of how we expected the recovery  to unfold.  We talked  about expecting inflatio n to be quiescent for a considerable period.  We moved fro m there to talking about the need  for caution but patience in the removal of policy accommodation.   Then we indicated that ra tes would likely move up at a measured pace, and it seem s to me that we have reached the point  where we can begin that process.  139 of 203                                                   5 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 5).  And I see little reason to change  very much in terms of the manner in which we have anticipated that events would unfold. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mr. Reinhart. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.5  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the material that Carol Low is in the process of handing out.  The staircase plotted in the top left panel of your first exhibit shows the path of  the federal funds rate consistent with money market futures through year-end assumi ng that you will act only at regularly scheduled meetings.  Market participants uniformly expect you to firm policy ¼ percentage point this after noon, the first installment in a sequence of actions that is anticipated to push the funds rate up to 2¼ percent by December.  This message from futures markets, repeated in the top line of the table at the right, was mostly echoed by primary dealers in the Desk’s recent survey, the second line, although the median respondent saw the funds rate as just touching 2 percent at year-end.  As shown in the remaining cells of the table, eight out of ten of those dealers expected the Committee to keep its assessments of the risks to its growth and inflation objectives as balanced, and all of them anticipated retention of the “measured” language or substitution of something similar.  The remaining four panels of your exhibit make the case for ratifying expectations for this meeting by moving the funds rate up to 1¼ percent— which was presented as alternative B in the Bluebook.  As shown by th e black line in the middle left panel, keeping an unchanged nominal funds rate even as inflation has ticked higher has pulled an estimate of the real funds rate below zero and even further below the upwardly moving estimates of its equilibrium denoted by the shaded region.  Moreover, the recent step-up in inflation and erosion of the output gap combine in the monetary policy rules we rou tinely track (which are mostly  variants on Taylor’s rule) to call for a higher nominal funds rate, seen  in the upward slope to the green shaded area at the right.  Indeed, as you have kept  policy unchanged for the past year, you’ve moved from the middle portion of that band to  its lower edge.  The bottom two panels bear on the question of why you might be inclined to tighten now when you weren’t willing to do so in May.  For one reason, th e two employment reports averaging near 300,000 monthly additions to payrolls since the May 4 meeting may have convinced you that the expansion is se lf-sustaining.  For another,  the continued updrift of inflation compensation at the five-year matu rity and the recent swing in the five-to-ten-year-ahead measure may make you concer ned that inflation expectations could come unglued.  The time may have come to begin to remove policy accommodation at the measured pace of 25 basis points.  Or not, which is the subject of exhibit 2.  In the Bluebook, we presented simulation exercises using the staff’s FRB/US  model.  Unlike earlier incarnations of “optimal policy” in the Bluebook dubbed “ policymaker perfect foresight,” these 140 of 203  simulations give investors as  well as monetary policymak ers perfect foresight.  Even so, workers and households are assumed to form their expectations using a more limited set of information, a distinction th at makes sense given the huge amount of resources devoted by financial market partic ipants to divine policy intent and other economic conditions.   The simulations considering different inflation goals provide a convenient mapping from your longer-run intentions to ne ar-term policy decisions.  As noted in the first bullet in the top left panel an d shown by the dotted re d line in the middle panels, if the Committee interprets its goal of  price stability to be an about unchanged level of the bias-adjusted core  PCE price index—that is, if it has an inflation goal of 1 percent—these scenarios suggest that firming should commence immediately and probably at a pace that is quicker than “measured.”  A 1 percent inflation goal, though, may not be appealing for a number of  reasons, including the nearness of the zero lower bound to nominal interest rates and a concern about an increased reliance on declines in money wages and prices to e ffect needed changes in  relative prices.  Under a 2 percent inflation goal, the blue dashed line, the optimal control exercise recommends tightening soon, but not t oday.  Rather, you could accept the recent a bit quicker than in the baseline.    Your view of current and prospective re source slack may also influence your deliberations today.  The bottom left panel plots capacity utilization in manufacturing over the past quarter-century.  Capacity ut ilization has rebounded almost 4 percentage points since its trough last spri ng.  Some members might wonder if the rapidity of that climb casts doubt on whether inflation will remain as well behaved as in the staff forecast.  In particular, you mi ght be of the view that the closing of the gap influences price setting independently of the leve l of the gap or, gi ven the uncertainty surrounding estimates of the level of capacity, that resource utilization has risen into a region where it is difficult to assert with c onfidence that much slack remains.  If so, and remembering the missteps in monetary  policymaking in the late 1960s and 1970s, you might see the recent uptick in inflation as  suggesting that it would be better to err on the side of firming forcefully today rather than risk the trench battle required to remove excessive inflation at a later date.   But other members might see this same picture as evidence that a sizable amount of resources is still going unused and be dissatisfied with an outlook in which that slack is worked down only slowly.  Indee d, recent economic data on spending have been a shade disappointing, perhaps calling in to question the vigor of the economy in the second half of the year and offering the possibility that slack persists at a more elevated level.  And next year, the end to investment incentives and the waning of the effects of last year’s tax cuts produce a pronounced retrenchment in fiscal impetus, as seen in the sidebar, which will restrain aggregate spending.  The simulations suggest that deferring tightening a qua rter or two would allow the real rate to remain lower—and a bit below its equilibrium range—for longer than in the baseline, providing 141 of 203  encouragement to spending and sending producti on above that of its potential next year.  There may be an obstacle to either the firmer or easier policy considered in this exhibit—the words of your May announcemen t.  Given the economic outlook at the time, it seemed prudent to guard against the building of outsized expectations of tightening by conveying both the intent  to begin removing policy accommodation soon and the plan to do so at a measured pace, sentiments reinforced by many public comments by members over the intermeeting peri od.  Events would not seem to be so different today as to justify either not beginning to remove policy accommodation or not doing so in a measured way.  While the intention embodied in thos e words—even though quite conditional—be seen in the first column of the top left panel, market participants currently anticipate about 2¼ percentage  points of firming over the next year, considerably more than had been anticipated on the ev e of the three prio r episodes of policy tightening and more in line with what wa s actually delivered, the second column.  And substantial uncertainty la y beneath these averages.  For instance, as shown in the top right panel, economists surveyed just  before the February 4, 1994, tightening reported a median expectation that the funds rate would be  ½ percentage point higher by the fourth quarter of the year.  And the responses were quite diffuse, with one in ten expecting no policy action or even eas ing.  The limited available data on net positions in Treasury securities suggest that at least some market participants are acting on the expectatio n of policy tightening.  Those identified as nonhedgers in the futures market have significantly lightened  their long position in two-year Treasury futures (the middle left panel), and the prim ary dealers, in aggregate, have deepened their net short position in Tr easury securities with more th an three years to maturity (the middle right panel).  One source of large and va riable demands for Treasur y and other fixed-income securities in the past few years has been those of holders of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.  As the mortgage rate  changes relative to its recent level, the economic incentive to refinance fixed-rate  mortgages varies, implying corresponding alterations in prepayments of mortgage s and their effective duration.  In an environment of rising longer-term yields, durations of mortgages tend to lengthen, requiring those holders who seek to keep the aggregate duration of their portfolio relatively steady to sell some of their longer-term securiti es, potentially reinforcing the updraft in yields.  In current circ umstances, though, the average duration of mortgages, one estimate of which is plotte d at the bottom left, has moved up to about 4½ years, about as long as it gets.  It would seem unlikely, then, that mortgage hedging flows would contribute to upward pressures on rates as tightening commences.  Lastly, the very low cost of protection from default by financial firms plotted in the bottom right panel indicates that market participants are not expecting significant strains.  Evidence that the market  seems ready in the aggregate, of course, 142 of 203  does not preclude that individual firms will run into trouble.  But many have taken the opportunity to prepare, sugges ting that those who have not pose only limited systemic risk and should receive even more limited sympathy.   I have left discussion about your words for my last exhibit, which updates the alternative B column of table 1 of th e Bluebook based on members’ comments to soften the characterization of incoming inflation data and to trim the last sentence for clarity.  Besides aligning the language to the reality of recent data releases, the wording of alternative B points out that policy remains accommodative, even after policy action, in the rationale paragraph.  It also retains as sessments of balanced risks to your two objectives on the view that the outlook does not differ materially from that at the May meeting, when you made a similar choice.  Also in the risk-assessment paragraph, the measured pace sentence refers only to inflation, not resource slack, to align market expectat ions to the Committee’s dominant concern.  Lastly, the alternative B wording pairs th e conditional commitment to remove policy accommodation at a measured pace with th e reassurance that you’ll do whatever it takes to keep inflation in check should the price outlook turn adverse.  You might view this as piling on extra words to so lve a problem that could be resolved by dropping the measured sentiment altogether.  To be sure, saying less would restore a good measure of flexibility.  But depending on the data over the next six weeks, these words encompass a 25 or 50 basis point move  at the August meeting; and by deleting them, you would lose the opportunity to r eassure market participants that your outlook is such that you likely can tighten  gradually and that you retain your inflation-fighting credentials.  This raises a final topic that I embrace with all the enthusiasm associated with Sisyphus when he determines the time has come to begin rolling that big rock up the hill once more.  Namely, I should point out a structural issue about your communication policy that may emerge in  the next few meetings.  The risk-assessment paragraph provides th e opportunity to hint abou t the future direction of interest rates.  In the past few meetings, the last added sentence has been sufficiently explicit about your intent—whether about a considerable period, your patience, or a willingness to be measured—as to trump how ever you characterized the risks to your two goals.  If you envision dropping the final fe w sentences, you’ll be left with the stripped-down risk assessments, which may not be that informative if they are left at balanced.  One possibility would be to til t the risks toward the upside now, explaining that, if the current degree of accommoda tion were maintained over the next few quarters, growth could well exceed its su stainable pace and inflation exceed that associated with price stability.  But the nuances of the switch might well elude market participants, who as I have already noted e xpect the announcement of balanced risks.  The risk-averse recommendation on the risk assessment is that, if it hides a few landmines that may prove troublesome in the future, there may be time to fix it after this meeting, including in the Chairman’s semiannual testimony next month.  That concludes my prepared remarks.  143 of 203

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Vincent?  If not, let me star t off by noting that recent commentary—not only the anec dotal discussions around this ta ble but also the reports from our various Beige Book contacts, directors, and the like—have all pointed to an extraordinarily expansive economy and to the emergence of underlyi ng inflationary pressure s.  On the other hand, when we look at the basic data fo r the recent period, we see a series  of downward revisions.  This kind of disparity usually is not fo und in the same set of information unless we seasonally adjust the anecdotes, and I’m not quite sure ho w one goes about doing that!  With regard to the data, the latest revisions for GDP and new orders have been down, initial claims have defini tely stopped declining, and this morning we lear ned that the latest data on purchas e originations fr om the Mortgage Bankers Association fell fairly significantly.  Th ere is something very inte resting going on, and in time we will figure out what  it is.  I am sure that  our favorite ex-m ember of the Boar d of Governors, in addition to his three rules that  were mentioned earlier, has a four th rule that will suggest how that is done.   I think that the surprises, st rangely enough, are not in meas ures of inflation.  The big surprise is in profit margins. They have surged at a pace we haven’t seen in more than twenty years. The arithmetic of profit margins te lls us something very interesting.  At the level of about 12 percent for nonfinancial corporations on a consolidated basis, the arithme tic essentially indicates that a 1 percentage point increase in profit margins ov er a one-year time fram e elevates the rate of inflation by 1 percentage point if unit costs are flat.  And, indeed, if profit margins were to increase by 1 percentage point per quarter when overall unit costs are flat, we would end up with an additional 4 percentage points of inflation.  In fact, st arting in 2003, profit ma rgins rose, on average, close to 1 percentage point per quarter; fortunately, this was partly offset by  a drop in overall labor and nonlabor unit costs.  Looking at the monthly patterns that are implicit in the income data for this 144 of 203  year, it appears that profit margins have been essentially unchanged thus far through the month of and price increases that do not reflect further significan t increases in margins.   Profit margins, as has been pointed out, are at the upper edge of the range beyond which historically they have not tended to rise.  The reason  is largely that, if they were to rise further, the result would be to cont ravene the long-term stab ility of the ratio of prof its to nationa l income.  Indeed, what we are beginning to see, I suspect, is an effort to  harvest these very large profit and capital, the effect of which is to cause unit costs to move up.  The way that apparently is occurring at this stage is largely through the effects on productivity, as we were  discussing earlier. The compensation of employees does not appear to have accelerated materially, although it is unclear what the last couple of months are showing.  It is fairly evident that the real issue does not relate to structural productivity growth but to act ual growth.  What the da ta for April and May are suggesting is a very significant slowing in produc tivity and, indeed, a mark ed pickup in unit labor costs.  Unit nonlabor costs actually, if anything, are reflecting a general decl ine in fixed costs as the economy’s expansion spreads fixed costs over a wider base.  So, what  we are observing through the first five months of the year ma y be the beginning of a shift fr om the falling ov erall unit costs observed last year to a pickup largely because act ual productivity growth, which was growing at a pace well above that of structur al productivity, has moderated.  We are moving from the behavior  of inflation as wholly the consequence of rising productivity, and therefore rising profit margins to increasing evidence of stabilizing margins, with some evidence that the stabilizatio n is being induced by some slow ing in productivit y growth.  In turn, unit labor costs are beginning to move up.  It now looks as though increases in unit labor costs 145 of 203  are somewhat above 2 percen t, maybe between 2.5 and 3 percent at an annual rate in  the most recent month or two. Incidentally, the underlying infl ation rate, using the market-bas ed core PCE measure, is at an annual rate of 2.1 pe rcent for April and May, and for the latest three months it goes up to 2.4 percent.  So core PCE seems to have moved into a channel that  appears to be slightly above a 2 percent annual rate, but th at is in the context of still very high  profit margins, which could very readily begin to decline and brin g the inflation rate down.   It is difficult to judge at this  stage how to play th is; but it is very obv ious, looking at the data, that what we are interpreting as cost pass-th rough is essentially an increase in profit margins. The reason is that, if final prices remain unchanged and costs increase, that is another way of saying that the cost pass-through does not exist and profit margins contract.  On the other hand, if there is a full cost pass-through, of n ecessity final prices must rise as profit margins re main intact.  Therefore, profit margins are probably a good  indicator on a consolidated ba sis of the degree of cost pass-through, which we have s een happening at a fairly  pronounced rate.  As I said before, we’ve had profit margins rising at the fastest pace in twenty years, and that’s another way of saying that we have moved from a price discounting environment to one of full pricing power.  Remember, it’s competition that enforces the tendency of real  wages eventually to paralle l productivity growth.  If that is the case, algebraically we are talking about a constant share of profit s to national income in the long run.   Our major outlook problem at this stage gets to the issue of tryi ng to estimate total unit costs and more specifically, on a consolidated basis, unit  labor costs.  The latt er, as you know, compose two-thirds or more of co nsolidated costs. Here we  have a very interestin g set of numbers.  We know, as some have commented, th at average hourly earnings have really been quite contained and, 146 of 203  indeed, are running be low 2 percent at an annual rate.  Wages and salaries per hour that are implicit in the personal income data are running significantly  higher.  And I have the data here if I can only find them in my usual well-organize d filing system.  [Pause]  I have them now.  The table with these data was sitting where it was supposed to  be, and therefore I couldn't find it! In the first quarter, wages and sala ries per hour were rising at a 3 ⅓ percent annual rate and were increasing at a somewhat higher pace in the Ap ril–May period. What that tells us is that the average hourly earnings of supervisory workers, wh ich are not published separately, must be rising fairly significantly or, alternativ ely, the way we usually term it is that  the skilled–lesser skilled differential is continuing to open up in the wage ma rket.  Another way of puttin g this is th at average hourly wages of college graduates are rising faster than those of lesse r educated workers.  Now, this obviously raises questions  about the meaningfulness of the ag gregate unemployment rate as it affects this total system.  As far as I can see, there does not appear to be anything in the monthly data that suggests that overall wages and salaries  per hour are accelerating in any material way.  Obviously, our analysis is running into other labor income and supplements that are somewhat stronger, but the problem at this stage does not appear to be an acceleration in wages.  The basic problem is an apparent slowdown in productivity that is cr eating the possibility of increased unit costs that will either affect profit margin s or get passed through into higher prices. All that said, the data as  best I can judge them at this stage appear to be cons istent with flat profit margins and units costs that are rising at an annual rate in the area of, say, 2½ percent, or alternatively with gradually declining profit marg ins, which is what one would expect in this environment.  That would bring the core inflation rate down to a level of about 2 percent with no real evidence of acceler ation going farther out. 147 of 203  Without getting into  the details of the data we have c onstructed for nonfinancial, non-energy corporations, if we consid er the impact of oil, obviously we ca n see fairly significant increases in unit costs stemming from higher energy costs.  Incidentally, when we perform this type of consolidation, we also see that unit import costs are rising and then flattening out.  In any event, gasoline prices are coming down qu ite considerably.  One of the reasons is that margins both at refineries and at marketing opera tions are running well in excess of what one would ordinarily expect, given the refinery acquisition cost of crude oil.  In fact, the data point to an excess margin of something like 20 cents a gallon, and if that comes down, it will have the e ffect of damping inflation psychology.   I might reiterate what has been pointed out pr eviously, namely that measures of long-term inflation expectations are remarkably contained.  Indeed, the measure that I find most useful in that regard is the forward ra te on one-year maturities nine years out. In other word s, it’s the yield associated with the last one-year  tranche of a ten-year note.  Th at yield has barely moved.  Well, actually it has moved; it has move d down in recent days and is no w definitely below its level in effect that market participants th ink the Fed is behind the curve.  If markets thought  that, we would see some very significant acceleratio n in inflation expecta tions and increases in interest rates.  But there are no real indications in the data that markets perceive us to be behind the curve.  The question is what we should do to make sure that co ntinues to be the case.  For one thing, I think we have to remember that how we mo ve forward is a function of how we evaluate balance sheets in the economy.  If everybody held one- day paper on the asset side of their balance sheet and overnight maturities on the liability side, then whatever we wanted to do would ha ve zero effect on the balance sheets and the income stat ements.  That is a critical issu e of the financia l sector.  But 148 of 203  because such a maturity structure does not generally exist, we have to be careful not to move too fast and risk destabilizing the financial system by enforcing maturity mismat ches and other idiosyncrasies in the financial system.   Remember, while the carry trades have come down and unwound to a si gnificant extent, as Vincent has pointed out, so  long as the markets per ceive that we will move only on the dates of our scheduled meetings, we ca n be absolutely assured that tomorrow the carry tr ade will come back for six weeks because one leg of the carry  is thought to be gu aranteed.  So, in effe ct there is no way we can create market ex pectations that put us in a position of having zero effect at the end of the day when we eventually move.   So where we are at this stage in my view is clearl y that we are going to move, or I hope we’re going to move, 25 basis points today.  We have to leave open th e possibility th at we may wish to move 50 basis po ints in August.  Even so, I would suggest that our post-meeting statement retain the notion that our further removal of policy a ccommodation will be at a pace that “is likely to be measured.”  But I also think it would be wise on our part to follow that sentence with a new sentence that essentially nullifies it but doesn’t eliminate it.  That sentence would say, “Nonetheless, the Committee will resp ond to changes in ec onomic prospects, as needed, to fulfill its obligations to maintain price stability.”   If we decide to go ahead  in that way, we w ill leave open the possib ility of dropping both sentences at our next meeting and then dealing stric tly with the issue, as Vincent pointed out, of the balance of risks statements.  I’m not saying that  we need to, or should , but we open up the possibility.  I would be very concerned were we  to drop the word “measured” th is time largely because the markets have adjusted to it.  They are in fact behaving as th ough they know where we’re going today and are in the process of adjusting.  If polic y expectations con tinue to work out 149 of 203  that way over time, the market effect will be virtua lly nonexistent.  Now, that is not going to happen as we certainly know.  Even so , I think we have to be careful  not to take any action without significantly foreshadowing what we are going to do one way or another.  We have the forthcoming semiannual testimony to ca librate how we want to be positioned for the August meeting.  And if it turns out in the next three weeks that we have sign ificant acceleration in inflation pressures, I would be prepared to suggest that 25 basis points is not  necessarily what we had in mind.  But we don’t need to say that today, and I think it would be a mistake to do so.  I conclude with a recommenda tion that we move up our target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and that we  issue the press statement that Michelle w ill now circulate.  It refers to the possibility that we may move at  a faster pace, bu t we will do so only if necessary. We need to be cautious because, if we move at a faster pace, we may be taking risks that we do not need to take.  [Pause]  Is that statement acceptable to everybody?  

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Do you want to start a go-a round on this issue? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, we  don’t need a go-around on this.  If you have an objection to the statement, please indicate it. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I guess I can  accept this statement.  I must say that  I’ve been sitting on a very pointed fence for a long tim e on this issue about language.  Woul d it be reasonable to ask Vincent to circulate in advance suggested language for our A ugust meeting—to give us some idea about what we are going to do about this so that we can thin k about it ahead of time?  I think there’s a sense around the table—certainly I feel  this way—that we’ve got to ge t out from under this language somehow.  And I think we need to sp end some time on this.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think that’s an ex cellent suggestion, and there’s no reason that it can’t be done.  Vincent could give alternate suggestions.  Even though we have six weeks to 150 of 203  do that, there’s no reas on that we can’t send out early versions of different possibilities if we decide to drop the last two sentences. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I would be tilling some of the ground of the two prior Fe rguson working groups, but I can give you alternative wordin g on different rationales th at the Committe e considered in its previous discussion s of communication policy. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  If we adopt the proposed statement, I think it would also be appropriate— perhaps in the monetary policy hear ing, Mr. Chairman—for you to in some way emphasize this last sentence that has been added to the statement.  I don’t know how to do th at exactly.  But I just worry that an implied comm itment to the market of moving 25 basis points per meeting could leave us with continuous declines in  the real federal funds rate.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This does not say tha t; it doesn’t make a co mmitment.  If you read it very closely, it says that we are forecasting that our moves are likely to be measured but that we will act on the ba sis of the evidence. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  All I’m saying is that I think the way this plays out is going to be influenced by the degree of emphasis placed on the one se ntence rather than the other sentence.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I agree with that. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  I hope that we can put a lot of emphasis on the importance of the data in driving what we do and try to back off from that imp lied commitment.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That is clearly my inclination.  Rememb er, we started with “considerable period,” then we went to “patience,” and now we’re  coming to va rious forms of unwinding the whole process. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  This is sort of the great-grandchild of “consi derable period!”  [Laughter] 151 of 203 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It has turned out bette r than we had any r eason to anticipate.  And I think we need one more turn of the screw to go back to  our old-fashioned balance of risk statement.  But I don’t th ink it has to be done today.  We d on’t need it.  Are there any further comments?  Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  I have a qu estion about one particular ph rase.  We have in this statement “hiring has pick ed up.”  On considerat ion, I’m worried ab out how that will be interpreted in the event that we get something like a month with 200,000 in job gains.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But hiring has picked up. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  But if we see a month w ith 200,000 of job cr eation people may say, well, hiring is not picking up.  So I was thinking about something more generic like “labor market conditions have improve d.”  That would be more expansiv e and therefore less susceptible to second-guessing.  It’s ju st a question.  I think both characterizations are correct, but one is more ambiguous in the fuller sense. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I have no objection to  that language if people would prefer that.  Is that satisfactory to everybody?  Let’s make that change. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  What were the words—“labor market co nditions have improved”? 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  “Labor ma rket conditions have improved.”  It’s a bit more ambiguous, so we don’t ha ve people overreacting to an  individual labor number. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think that ’s a useful addition.  Yes? 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I feel very much  the same as President Poole does about this.  I thought we should take the opportunity now that we’re increas ing rates to go back to the old formulation.  I probably should have responded to the Bluebook sooner with so me alternative language, which I worked on a little.  I can go  along with what you are suggesting.  I take your point that things have 152 of 203  gone pretty well with this  whole process.  But I think there’s go ing to be some scrutiny of the fact that we’re saying “measured” and then trying to take it away in the next sentence. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Actually , I started that process. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I know you did. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don’t think we got a negative reaction to that. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Maybe, maybe no t.  I’m not sure I agree wi th that.  But that’s your interpretation, and I’m willin g to go with it.  Nevert heless, I do think it wo uld be good for Vincent to figure out some ways in which we might say what  we did and why we did it and then characterize the risks in a simple fash ion the way we used to.  I hope we’ll go back to statemen ts that are a little shorter and more formulaic and stop tr ying to create great grandchildren. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That’s  where we’re head ed.  Any further comments?  Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  We may be head ed there, but remember this:  When we had all of these working groups that Roger chaired regarding language  to describe the balance of risks, we had very difficult problems shaping that into clear communica tion.  First, we have an  issue that we’ll never resolve on exactly what we mean by the output ga p.  And when we’re talking about inflation risk, what are we assuming about  rates?  Are we assuming that the f unds rate equilibrium  is 1 percent or 2 percent or what?  We had horribl e problems.  I think we got into this process partly because the balance of risk language didn’t really do the job.  An d I actually think this  statement is clear. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, le t’s put it this wa y.  We can drop those two sentences and put in additional sent ences.  I think there’s general agreement within the Committee as to where we want to go and it’s me rely a question of finding the appropriate  language.  So far, this innovation of putting it in the Bluebook I th ink has worked surprisingly well. 153 of 203 

[SECTION]

 MR. GRAMLICH.  I’m just trying  to caution everyone not to think that the balance of risks formulation is going to be  a panacea because it  really wasn’t be fore and I don’t think it will be now. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, th at’s something we are about to find out.  If there are no further questions and this is  acceptable, would you kindly read the appropriate language? 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNARD.  I’ll begin with th e directive itself, wh ich is on page 14 of the Bluebook:  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks mone tary and financial conditions  that will foster price stability and promote sust ainable growth in output .  To further its lo ng-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future  seeks conditions in reserve mark ets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate  to an average of around 1¼ percent.” Then with regard to the portion of the statement in the press release that is part of the vote, which is the third paragraph, th e wording is:  “The Committee perceives th e upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth  and price stability for th e next few quarters are roughly equal. With unde rlying inflation still ex pected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respon d to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligations to maintain price stability.”

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Th e last item on our agenda is to  confirm that the date of our next FOMC meeting is August 10.  Before we adjourn, I’d like to  request that the members of the Board of Governors adjourn to my office to address the issue of th e discount rate.  Today we have an extraordinary situation in that all twelve Reserv e Banks are requesting an increase in the discount rate.  [Secretary’s note:  Shor tly after the end of this meetin g, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to approve pending requests for discount rate incr eases of 25 basis points, to 2¼ percent, from all twelve Federal Reserve Banks.]
