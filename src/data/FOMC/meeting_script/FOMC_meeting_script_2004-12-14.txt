CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Good morning, everyone.  Normal ly, when I ask approval of the minutes, they are in th e same form as the draft sent to you ear lier.  I just wanted to indicate that there is a change since that earlier communication, and that is the addition of the notation vote by the Committee authorizing Presiden t Santomero to accept the honor of the title “Cavaliere” to be awarded by the government of Ital y.  I believe that vote was affirm ative.  [Laughter]  So, would somebody like to move approval of th e minutes of our November meeting? 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So moved.

SPEAKER(?).  Second. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection,  they are approve d.  Dino Kos. MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  With the outcome of this meeting firmly priced into markets, the intermeeting pe riod was characterized by more than usual attention to exchange rate developments.  Dollar sentiment was bearish for most of the period, and thus the market was caught offside by last week’s sudden appreciation.  The behavior of Asian central  banks, from both a policy and a portfolio perspective, gripped the markets during much of the period and continues to do so.  The top panel on page 1 graphs the th ree-month U.S. and euro-denominated deposit rates.  The solid red and green lines depict Libor fixings.   The dashed lines graph the three-month deposit rates nine m onths forward for both currencies.  With the tightening cycle advancing in the Unite d States, short-term rates—represented by the solid red line—are now higher than in the euro area.  However, perhaps the more interesting point is what has happened to  forward rates.  At the time of your generally positive data.  Meanwhile, euro forward rates have declined and now sit very close to the cash rate.  With economic data in Eu rope showing sluggishness and with the strength of the euro adversely a ffecting export prospect s, the ECB’s earlier expected tightening has been priced out, and many in the market are talking about a possible easing.    Looking at a somewhat longer time frame, the bottom left panel graphs U.S.–German three-month interest rate differentials  since the beginning of the year.  Dollar interest rates have gone from being 120 basis points lower to being almost 3 of 118   ¼ percentage point higher.  At the long e nd of the curve, as shown at the bottom right, the relationship is more volatile.  But there, too, dolla r interest rates are higher by about ½ percentage point—with the most  recent widening driven almost entirely by a fall in German yields, as recent data disappointed.  I shoul d note that Japanese yields, although not shown here, also have fallen modestly, as incoming data were disappointing there as well.  The favorable shift in interest rate differ entials might have been expected to help the value of the dollar.  However, as show n at the top of page 2, the dollar has been on a downward trend.  In mid-November, comments about the current account by Secretary Snow and Chairman Greenspan in  the days surrounding the G-20 meeting in Europe were interpreted by some as si gnaling acquiescence to the dollar’s fall, though sentiment was so bearish at the tim e that perhaps any comments might have had the same response.  With the market so  one-sided, it did become vulnerable to a sudden reversal, even in the absence of any fundamental news.  The extent of the positions can be seen in the middle panel, which graphs the IMM’s net noncommercial positions for three majo r currencies—the euro, the yen, and sterling—against the dollar.  After a rather  uneventful summer, speculators began to build up short dollar positions in early fall.  By mid-November sentiment was overwhelmingly bearish and positions extended.  As some accounts began to reduce risk, there was position squaring in severa l so-called crowded tr ades, including these short dollar positions, which fed last week ’s appreciation.  The dollar’s fall is certainly affecting returns on U.S. assets for foreigners.  The bottom panel graphs the return year to date for a va riety of asset classes and for the U.S. dollar index.  Returns for most asset classes cluster around 5 per cent, with high-yield bonds being higher.  But for foreign investors, returns for most classes are closer to zero, given the nearly 5 percent fall in the dollar.  Another focus of market a ttention has been the behavi or of Asian central banks from both a policy and a portfolio perspectiv e.  Page 3 provides updates of two charts I showed at the last meeting.  The top pane l graphs the Chinese yuan spot rate—fixed at 8.28—and the one-, six-, and twelve -month forward rates derived from nondeliverable forwards that are traded offshor e and settled in dollars.  This is a small and timing of a possible revalu ation of the yuan.  Since your  last meeting, the forward discounts have widened, as speculation grew of a near-term change in the regime.  This is despite Premier Wen’s comments th at any move to make the exchange rate more flexible would not come if there we re pressure from fo reigners or from the principle, and one would expect that markets will intermittently pr ice in a change in the regime.  Meanwhile, other Asian countries have allowed some appreciation against the dollar—and therefore agains t the yuan—in recent months, as shown in the middle panel.  However, the pace of reserve accumulation has again begun to rise, suggesting that the authorities are nearing their limits.  Japan, on the other hand, has not 4 of 118   intervened, perhaps in part because the rise of the Kor ean won and other currencies means that Japan’s effective exchange rate has not risen as much as the yen’s bilateral rate against the dollar.  Investors have watched closely these countries’ willingness to tolerate further appreciation.  But they are watching at least as closely how these countries are managing the reserves they have accumulated.  There are two dimensions to this question.  First, are these central banks di versifying away from the dollar?  Several weeks ago a Russian central bank official publ icly disclosed that the Russian central bank had shifted some of its dollar reserv es into euros.  That announcement and—until recently—the steady decline in the dol lar fed speculation that Asian central banks might act similarly.  Of course, if ther e were a shift from dollars to euros, the immediate effect would be a further apprecia tion of the euro, which would result in an additional reduction in the value of the Asian central banks’ remaining dollars.  Also, a further appreciation of the euro is  something the ECB might resist at some point.  To date, several Asian central banks  have said that they have no plans to change their currency allocations, th ough market participants are wary.  The second dimension of the question is whether central banks are diversifying their dollar holdings from Treasuries into othe r asset classes.  Hard data on this point are hard to come by.  Anecdotally, those central banks with large reserve holdings have been growing both their Treasury a nd non-Treasury holdings for some time, though it’s fair to say that the growth ra tes of agency, MBS, and even corporate holdings have been faster than that for Tr easuries.  The bottom panel graphs the New York Fed’s aggregate custody holdings for Tr easury and agencies since the start of the year.  I should stress that this is an incomplete data set since central banks also hold securities with other custodians.  Nevertheless, this does suggest that—especially in recent weeks—there has b een a spike in agency holdings whereas Treasury holdings have been flat.  We are aware of one major account that sold outright some of its Treasuri es and re-allocated into agencies.  Since the buys and sells for such securities ar e conducted with different count erparties, it is entirely possible that those dealers seeing the sale of Treasuries may have extrapolated in thinking that this account wa s also selling the underlying dollars—and thus fed some of the rumors in recent weeks.   Turning to domestic markets on the next page, the short intermeeting period featured a continuation of recent trends.  Spreads are low and, if anything, have narrowed further.  Implied volatilities contin ued at very low leve ls, and the price of oil continued to fall while pri ces of equities rose.  The t op panel of page 4 graphs the two-year to ten-year spread.  The yield curve has continued to  flatten though there was a sharp, if brief, steepening in late November driven more by technical factors than any fundamental news.  Once the unw inding subsided, th e curve resumed its flattening trend and at 121 basis points is at it s flattest level in more than three years.  Financial conditions remain favorable.  As noted, corporate and emerging-market spreads are narrow.  The middle panel graphs  the absolute yield level for the EMBI+ and High-Yield indexes since 1997.  The comb ination of a lower Treasury curve and 5 of 118   narrower spreads has lowered absolute yields to levels where financial comedians are asking if the name of the high-yield index w ill need to be changed.  Finally, mortgage spreads continue to trade at low levels, as shown in the bottom left panel.  The large holdings of MBS previously accumulated by banks continue to attract attention on the theory that a sudden spread widening would trigger this group of investors to start liquidating these positions.  Turning to page 5, let me provide a quick update on the growth of outright Treasury holdings in the System Open Mark et Account.  The top panel graphs the net expansion of the SOMA from 1994 through 2003.  Not surprisingly, there is a correlation over the long term between the gr owth of currency in circulation and the growth of SOMA.  During this ten-year  period, currency in circulation grew by $35 billion per year (averaging over the Y2 K event).  Through November 2004 it has increased by $32 billion this  year.  Although similar in dollar magnitude to prior years, that represents a sl owdown in currency growth from about 7¼ percent in the 1994-2003 period to just under 6 percent this year.  The somewhat slower currency growth that has emerged in recent years appears to reflect weaker overseas demand.  The bottom panel graphs the Federal Reserv e’s direct net currency shipments going back to 1990—a somewhat longer period than  in the first two panels.  I should note that these data cover only the Fed’s ship ments and receipts.  We do not know how much currency left the country—or came b ack—via migrant workers, tourists, and other legal or illegal means, though we have no evidence to suggest that those relationships have chan ged in recent years.  In many years through 1997, foreign growth composed the bulk of overall currency growth.  Starting in 1998, ship ments overseas began to moderate, and averaging out Y2K effects, the overall trend of foreign shipments has been falling and in the last two years has turned negativ e.  Without the significant shipments to Argentina and Iraq in recent years, these numbers would have been lower still.  Mr. Chairman, that concludes my prepar ed remarks.  There were no foreign operations in the period.  I will need appr oval of domestic operations, and I’d be happy to take any questions. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With respect to th e direct net currency shipments abroad, recently I have seen reconciliation s between other techniques that en deavor to get to the aggregate amount of currency held abroad and the direct currency shipment s.  Are those other techniques indicating much the same story?  I presume, with the gr owth of currency in circulation slowing and with the foreign piece such a huge part of that, that a direct measure of shipments looks much like what we estimate is the total.  Is that accurate? 6 of 118   MR. KOS.  I believe so.  But as  I said, we don’t see the curre ncy that leaves the country—or that can come back in—by other means.  There seems to be a correlation between the middle panel and the bottom panel, but again, th ere is a lot of slippage because of other ways currency can leave the country.  But I have not seen a firm reconciliation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The way we estimate  foreign holdings from the stock of currency is not a bad technique.  Indeed, as I recall, the several di fferent measures yield roughly the same result.  So, the implication is that the net change in that estimated stock less the direct shipments is, indeed, a pres umed “other” component plus statistical  error.  Does that tend to be a small number or a large number? MR. KOS.  I can’t say th at I can tell you. 

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN.  I don’t have that either, Mr. Chairman, but I w ould note that our estimates of growth in foreign-held currency are actu ally still somewhat larger  for this year than for domestic currency, despit e the negative net shipment s that Dino referred to.  For instance, we are projecting that foreign currency is growing about 6¾ percent for 2004  as a whole, whereas domestic currency growth we estima te at about 4 percent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So that suggests that there’s an unexplained significant residual.  On the IMM traders report, to what exte nt are the net long and short positions useful in anticipating changes in rates?  My presumption is that, historically, if there was a relationship, it disappeared as soon as somebody ob served it.  What are the facts? MR. KOS.  We actually did some work on this.  Bob, do yo u remember the paper that we did a few years ago? 7 of 118  

[SECTION]

 MR. ELSASSER.  I think the basic conclusion th ere was that those data do seem to have some predictive power, but they ar e released with such a long lag that they are not useful for traders on a real-time basis. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  But there is other evidence that does suggest that, when everybody become s absolutely committed to the view that a currency is  going to mo ve in one direction or the other, one can always make money on the other side of that transaction.  At least that’s my recollection of history.  But I guess since nobody know s what these data are in real time, one can’t make that statement. MR. KOS.  People do use these data sometimes as a contra ry indicator—for the very reasons that you note. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Bu t if they do see a re lationship, it disappears. MR. KOS.  That’s the risk. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Other questions for Dino? 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  With the possibl e exception of thes e positions vis-à-vi s the dollar, there seem to be a remarkable number of indications—spreads are narrower, the yiel d curve is flatter, and so forth—that suggest that market participants see le ss risk.  Yet the risks seem  to be out there.  We hear people talking about that a ll the time.  Some  of this betting against the dollar reflects the international risks having to do with the size of our deficit an d the way the curre ncy markets are going.  There is a potential for mark ets to get upset about fiscal defi cits going forwar d.  There seem to be a lot of risks out there, but we don’t see it in the curves much.  Do people talk  about that at all? MR. KOS.  Yes.  The short answer is yes.  They have observed—especially over the last year —any number of things that  should have and did create un certainty.  Yet there was this dichotomy where volatilities were low and spreads were low.  So yes, th ere has been this 8 of 118   dichotomy, and people talked about it.  There’s a ce rtain amount of frustration about it as well, I think, because it doesn’t make sense in terms of most people’s mental models of how these things work. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Yes.  A couple of people I talked to in th e investment world characterized the situation as a sort of  tight equilibrium that was balanced of f against risk on bo th sides.  They approach it with a sense of unease because  they view it as not necessarily stable. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  An y further comments or questions?  If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the domestic open ma rket operations? 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  So moved. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objection, they are approved.   We move on to Dave Stockton. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In brief, the news that we have received since the completion of the N ovember Greenbook five weeks ago has been supportive of the view that the economy has been growing modestly above trend and will likely continue to do so into next year.  Indeed, both the incoming data on economic activity and some of the key factor s that condition the projection point to a more favorable outlook than was anticipated in our previous projection.  A pickup in the pace of hiring and stronger growth of c onsumption led us to mark up the projected pace of real GDP growth in the second half  of this year by ¼ percentage point, to 3¾ percent at an annual rate.  Since th e publication of last week’s Greenbook, we received stronger-than-expect ed readings on retail sale s and wholesale inventories and weaker-than-expected figures on internationa l trade.  On net, these data appear to be about a wash for current-quarter GDP.  Looking beyond the near term, higher equity  values, larger gains in house prices, a lower exchange value of the dollar, and a drop in oil prices suggest greater upward impetus to spending and activity over the next two years.  In fact, incorporating this more favorable configuration of financia l and oil market developments into our projection would have resulted in output overs hooting potential.  In  order to forestall that outcome, we raised the trajectory of  the assumed federal funds rate, and we are now just slightly below the path implied by futures prices.  I suppose that if I were truly in the holiday spirit I would give you a gift by stoppi ng right here, because that is pretty much the story behind the forecast.   But seasonally adjusted, I’m not feeling any more generous than usual.  9 of 118   So let me start with the labor market.  The October and November employment reports did not provoke in us the same e uphoria followed by disappointment that was apparent in the reactions of financial markets.  Taken together, the employment increases in October and November were  noticeably stronger than had been incorporated in the previous Greenbook and allayed our concerns that weakness in the labor market might sap the vigor of the expa nsion.  As I noted at the last meeting, our of this year at around 100,000 per month.  But it now looks as if hiring has been running around 160,000 per month, and we expe ct it to pick up to around 225,000 per month by the spring.  Most other readings on the labor market also point to a gradual improvement.  The only discordant note has been the increase in initial claims over the past two weeks.  We are not yet inclined  to read much into that increase, but it does highlight downside risks to the employment outlook.  Consumer spending also surpri sed us to the upside.  In  response to the incoming news, we raised the projected growth of r eal PCE by ½ percentage point in the second half of this year, and yesterday =s retail sales release sugge sts a further small upward adjustment of a few tenths to our fourth- quarter consumption forecast.  We are now estimating that real PCE advanced at an a nnual rate of more th an 5 percent in the third quarter and will increase at a 3½ percent pace in the current quarter.  That slowdown is more than accounted for by a dr op-off in motor vehicle sales in October and November.  With inventories remaining uncomfortably high, we are expecting that the automakers will be forced in comi ng months to adopt a combination of some cutback in production from current schedules and sweetened incentives to boost sales.  Outside motor vehicles, real PCE is now projected to grow at a 4¼ percent annual rate in the current quarter, a bit faster than in the third quarter.  The anecdotes about the holiday selling season have been mi xed to downbeat in recent weeks.  I don’t think that we have ever been very succe ssful in matching holiday anecdotes to the published data.  Still, we’ve assumed a weak December for retail sales, in part on the basis of these stories and the dropb ack in weekly chain store sales.  In the business sector, outlays for capital equipment have continued to increase steeply, with real E&S up about 17 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter and projected to increase 11 per cent in the fourth quarter.  Taken together, those gains were close to our earlier expectations.  In l ooking at our E&S forecast, it is clear that we are approaching something akin to a “m oment of truth.”  A few years back, based on calibrated theoretical  models and a healthy dose of  judgment, we built into our forecast of equipment spending a noticeable effect from partial expensing.  That effect included a boost to spending during the period wh en partial expensing was permitted, followed by a pothole after its expira tion.  Gee, it seemed pretty logical at the time.  And even now, there is evidence to support our position.  Real spending on equipment has exceeded the expectations of our econometric models that make no allowance for partial expensing—and by an am ount close to that of our estimate of the expensing effect.  Moreover, new orders  for capital goods fell off in October and fell a bit more than is necessary to create ou r first-quarter dip in spending.  And while the anecdotes have been underwhelming, we’ve always recognized that only a small 10 of 118   fraction of firms would be on a margin wher e this provision actually influenced their spending decisions.  But all that said, it just doesn’t feel as if the risks are symmetric around this aspect of our projection.  The probability that the e ffect will turn out to have been smaller than that incorporated in our projection seem s larger to me than the probability that this effect will exceed our expectations.  Part of my discomfort arises from the recognition that, if we had st arted out our forecast with a null hypothesis that partial expensing would have no effect on spending, I could easily imagine myself sitting here today arguing that the data and anec dotes had not contradi cted that hypothesis either.  I don’t want to ex aggerate the vulnerability of  our GDP projection to this assumption.  In fact, we have offset about  two-thirds of the tax-induced swing in equipment spending in inventories and imports so that domestic production of capital goods is much less affected than spending.  St ill, if the partial-e xpensing effect turns out to be smaller than we have estim ated and underlying demand for equipment correspondingly stronger, the economy is  likely to carry somewhat greater momentum into early next year  than is implicit in our forecast.  While crossing one’s fingers is not a forecasting methodology t ypically covered in graduate-level econometrics, that is what we will be doi ng over the next few months.  [Laughter]  Of course, the momentum that the economy carries forward into next year will be affected to a much greater extent by the broader developments in the economic and financial environment than by the effects of partial expens ing.  And on that score, the key factors conditioning our projection have  strengthened noticeably over the past five weeks.  As you know, one of the key upside risks we saw to the projection was the possibility that the accommodative st ance of monetary policy would be accompanied by sharper movements in asset markets than we were forecasting.  Some of those risks may have manifested them selves of late, at le ast to some degree.  The stock market is about 4 percent highe r than in our previous projection; house prices are projected to average about 5 per cent higher; the price of imported crude oil is about $3 per barrel lower, on average, in 2005 and about $2 per barrel lower in 2006; and although the dollar has retraced some  of its earlier declines, by the time we closed the Greenbook last Wednesday, it was st ill below our previous projection.  The increase in household net worth associated with higher prices for equities and houses provides a considerable boos t to household spending over the projection period, as does the increase in real income stemming from the lower price of oil.  Meanwhile, the weaker dollar is projected to give a lift to exports and to  trim the growth of imports.  The only notable factor on the negative side of the ledger was the further downward revision that we made to our for ecast of spending on high-tech equipment.  While the news was not uniformly downbeat , enough of it was negative to make us take another hard look at our forecast.  W ith relative prices for tech equipment not reportedly cautious about the outlook, we lowe red our projection of the growth of real 11 of 118   high-tech equipment spending.  We now proj ect that the growth of spending on this equipment will equal, rather than exceed, its historical average going forward.  We believe that this outlook be tter balances the risks.  On net, the positives for the economic outlook significantly outweighed the negatives and, as I noted ear lier, without an adjustment to our policy assumption would have resulted in ac tual real GDP overshooting pot ential by the end of the projection period.  As a consequence, we ra ised our path for the funds rate 50 basis points, bringing the assumed level to 2¾ pe rcent by the end of next year and to 3¼ percent by the end of 2006.  Our assumed pa th is now just ¼ percentage point, on average, below that implicit in the fed funds futures market.  These adjustments altered the contour of our projection, with faster growth  in real GDP now projected for next year, followed by a more noticeable  slowing of growth in 2006 as the less accommodative stance of policy shows through.  The inflation picture has changed little over the intermeeting period.  Our forecast for core CPI in October was right on the mark, as was our forecast for core PCE.  Moreover, there have been only modest change s in the key determinants of inflation.  The larger-than-expected drop in the price of oil is partly offset by the higher prices for non-oil imports.  In our forecast, total PCE inflation is still expected to recede from 2½ percent this year to about 1¼  percent in 2005 and 2006, while core PCE inflation remains roughly unchanged at 1½ percen t over the next two years.  As in the previous forecast, that stability in core  inflation is brought about by several small offsetting effects.  A diminishing margin of slack and some slowing of structural productivity are expected to place slight  upward pressure on inflation.  But these effects are offset by some reversal of this year’s jump in energy prices and a smaller projected rise in non-oil import prices.  At the last meeting, Vice Chairman Geithner asked, in effect , whether the benign outlook for inflation in our baseline and even in our alternative simulations reflected a lack of imagination on our part or, perhap s the unstated alternative, a lack of intelligence.  [Laughter]  I was at least grateful to implicitly be offered a choice—you know, cigarette or blindfold.  In the end, I’m  not certain that we can offer the Vice Chairman much comfort on the intelligence fr ont.  But we did attempt to exercise our imaginations better, and it is fair to say that, in surveying the landscape, some upside risks to inflation strike us as potentially more potent than others.  One risk is that economic growth will  exceed our expectations, causing resource utilization to tighten more  quickly than in the baseline projection.  While that outcome certainly cannot be ru led out, we don’t see the implications for inflation as being especially large, at l east over the two-year time fram e of our projection.  As we have highlighted in the past, inflation simply is not very sensitive to the output gap in our models; the effect is not zero, but it is nonetheless small.  Moreover, a corollary to this observation is that, if we have mi s-estimated the natural rate of unemployment or the output gap, we don =t think the consequences for inflation would be large over 12 of 118   the next eight quarters—again because infl ation does not appear to be especially sensitive to resource utilization.  Another risk might be th at the upward pressure on inflation from rising commodity and materials prices will intens ify in the coming year.  Oil prices have certainly surprised us and participants in  futures markets this year.  Moreover, a steeper slide in the dollar or more rapid improvement in industrial activity here or abroad could produce more significant pressu res in commodities markets.  If sharp increases in materials costs were to conti nue, an increasing fraction of firms that to date have absorbed these costs may attempt to pass them on to customers.  Based on quotes from futures markets, we don’t see a continuation of rapid gains in commodity prices as the most likely outcome, and give n the small share of costs accounted for by raw materials, the consequences of an upsid e surprise do not loom especially large.  Nonetheless, it does seem a risk worth closely monitoring.   In our view, a more prominent and sizabl e upside risk to the projection is that firms will act more aggressively to raise pr ices in order to limit the damage done to their profit margins by slow ing productivity and rising unit labor costs.  Those tendencies could be amplifie d if productivity slows mo re sharply than we are projecting.  As you know, we showed a simu lation combining these developments in the Greenbook, and the consequence was an  acceleration of core PCE prices to 2¼ percent by 2006, ¾ percentage point above the baseline forecast and at the outer edge of our 70 percent confid ence interval.  We don’t think that the evidence favors such an outcome, but we see this as an important vulnerability in our otherwise sanguine outlook.  More broadly, we are trying to remain esp ecially alert to developments that would suggest that this year’s price shocks w ill propagate forward into higher underlying inflation.  In addition to the possibility of slower growth of labor productivity, any signs of a significant pickup in nominal wa ges would have troubling implications for costs and prices.  But the broad measures of hourly labor compensation have been running a very steady 4 percent or so over th e past year, with little indication of an imminent takeoff.  Inflation expectations also deserve close scrutiny.  Inflation compensation as measured by the five-y ear TIPS spread has moved up in recent months, but five- to ten-year inflation compensation has barely budged.  Moreover, survey measures—either short-term or long-term—have changed little over the past year.  At this juncture, we see still few signs  that this year’s upturn in inflation is the beginning of a process of more-pronounced de terioration.  Obviously, the size of the confidence intervals surrounding our forecast admits a reasonably wide range of outcomes over the next two years, both to  the upside and to the downside of our inflation projection.  Although we are comfor table with our outlook for inflation, we leave it to the Committee to decide whether th is forecast deserves a holiday turkey or whether it is the holiday turkey!  Karen will continue our presentation.

 MS. JOHNSON.  At this time of year, when persons old and young are looking for tangible evidence of whether they ha ve been naughty or nice during the past 13 of 118   twelve months, I cannot resist  taking joy in pointing out that some force, perhaps from the North Pole, has given the forecasters in the International Division the opportunity to say something that we have  been waiting to say for a long time: “As we forecast in the previous Greenbook, global oil prices have fallen on balance over the intermeeting period.”  [Laughter]  Indeed, they have fallen a bit more than we forecast, with the result that our forecast pa th for U.S. oil import prices has shifted down about $3 per barrel in 2005 and $2 per barrel in 2006.  One consequence of recent developments is that the futures cu rve for WTI prices and our projected path for the average price of importe d oil are flatter than they ha ve been in th e past several months, with only a relatively small further net change expected in oil prices from now through the end of 2006.  At the same ti me, uncertainty about future oil prices seems to be quite high.  The expected prices  for WTI for the January contract and the around the mean price for June is very wide, with the ⅔ probability interval ranging from $32 per barrel to $50 per barrel.  With the projected path for oil prices fa irly flat, the implications of global oil prices for growth and inflation abroad consis t mainly of the future effects of oil price developments that have already occurred.  Despite their recent declines, oil prices remain elevated from their levels one year ago.  We judge that th e slowing of activity in several foreign economies in the third qua rter is due at least in part to the net increase in oil prices this year.  The ne gative effects on output gr owth were relatively greater for the Asian emerging-market econom ies, which tend to be more dependent on imported oil than other regions, alt hough these economies have also felt the slowdown in the global high-t ech sector.  Over time, we expect the transitory influence of the spike in oil prices to di ssipate and average real GDP growth abroad to return to an annual rate of about 3¼ percent.  For the industrial countries and the emerging-market economies, headline inflati on will be up a bit in the near term and then subsequently edge back down, reflecting the path of oil prices.  During most of the intermeeting period, the dollar continued the downward trend that had resumed in mid-September, with  the index of major currencies reaching a point early last week that was 12 percent below its May peak and a nine-year low.  widening U.S. trade deficit as a major factor  driving the dollar’s slide.  At the time that we were putting the finishing touches on the December baseline forecast, recent exchange rate moves indicated that we should lower the path for the real value of the broad index of the dollar about 3 percent.  However, subsequently the dollar has significantly reversed its inte rmeeting move in a sharp appreciation.  No particular data release or event seems to have tri ggered the climb of the dollar.  Market participants point to incentives for traders to take profits and to eliminate previously established short dollar positions ahead of the year-end.  Our baseline December forecast incorporat es the lower path projected for the dollar directly in U.S. trade prices and volumes and, as a consequence, in the outlook for domestic activity and inflation in a comp lex way.  Of course, daily fluctuations in 14 of 118   the dollar cannot be anticipated and coul d easily put us back at the December Greenbook starting level.  However, had we not revised the path for the dollar and so left it unchanged from that in the Nove mber Greenbook, our trade equations suggest that the partial effect of th is change alone would have b een to increase the negative contribution of net exports to U.S. real GDP growth about 0.15 percentage point in 2005 and 0.1in 2006 relative to what is curre ntly in the Decemb er Greenbook.  With such a higher path for the dollar, import pr ice inflation in the baseline would have been noticeably lower in the near term but little change d in 2006.  By the fourth quarter of 2006, the partial effect of a hi gher dollar path would be to widen the projected current account de ficit about $35 billion.    In addition to the moves in oil prices and the exchange value of the dollar, the other major feature of the inte rnational forecast at this time is that we have again revised down projected foreign growth, partic ularly in the near term.  As mentioned earlier, to some degree this reflects the c onsequences of elevated  oil prices.  But it also reflects more-fundamental shortfalls in macroeconomic performance in some regions—for example the euro area, where we have lowered our forecast for real GDP growth throughout the forecast period.  Persistent weakness in domestic demand in the euro area is a vulnerability that restrains global recovery and undercuts the adjustment of U.S. external deficits.    Weak domestic spending in the euro area is a ssociated primarily with Germany.  One factor that is thought to be at least partly responsible is the extensive discussion of and, at least some progress on, implementation of structural reforms in the participating countries.  For example, Germ an pension reform appears to be creating incentives for higher savings on the part of households, as th e prospects of less-generous pensions or the uncertainty a bout how the reformed system will function increase the perceived need for private a ssets.  Given the very large unfunded public liabilities associated with social insurance systems in Europe, successful reform and higher personal savings would be helpful.  However, for those savings to be realized in higher capital stocks and improved Germ an output growth, private investment spending must also be stimulated.  Such a response might require some reduction in interest rates, led by easing on the part of the ECB, in order to maintain utilization of macroeconomic resources during the implemen tation of reforms.  Action on the part of the ECB is made less likely, however, by the continued recording of headline inflation above the target ceiling of 2 per cent.  Euro-area inflation is “stuck” at 2 percent in part because governments, particularly the German government, are turning to increases in administered prices as they seek higher re venue to keep overall budget deficits from rising even further.  On balance, our outlook for the euro area during the forecast period is slow growt h, at about 1¾ percent, as the long-run positive benefits of the structural reform efforts are either yet to arrive or are overwhelmed by negative, short-run consequences.  We have also revised down our projec tion for near-term growth in Japan.  Recently released GDP data and current i ndicators paint a pi cture of real GDP expansion in Japan that is not as strong as we and the markets had expected.  Growth 15 of 118   should rebound from less than ½ percent at an  annual rate in the second half of this year to only about 1½ percent annual rate during 2005.  This morning, trade data for October were released.  The trade deficit came in at $55.5 billion, up $4.5 billion from September a nd noticeably larger than both we and the markets had anticipated.  The increase in the deficit primarily reflected a surge in merchandise imports; exports increased only mo destly.  These data will no doubt lead us to revise down our projection for real net exports in the current quarter, although we obviously have not had time to digest fully the implications  for the outlook.  A rough, back-of-the-envelope calculation sugge sts that the contri bution of real net exports to U.S. GDP growth could be revised down enough to bring the negative contribution in the current quarter to around ½ percentage point.  This number should be taken with a grain of salt, however, as we are reluctant to rely too heavily on one month’s worth of volatile data.  That concludes our presentation.  Dave and I will be happy to answer your questions.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for our colle agues?  You realize that, if there are no questions, this is a historic  occasion!  [Laughter]  Hearing none, who would like to start our discussion?  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since we’re making history today, the Seventh District’s economy continued to firm, an d the strength appears broad-based.  Our business contacts again report increasing production, stro ng new orders, and growing backlogs.  Labor that orders are strong for professional and technica l help, but growth is a b it less rapid in the light industrial and clerical sectors. We recently held our eighteen th Annual Economic Outlook Symposium.  Twenty-six economists submitted forecasts this year, and they were a bit more pessimistic than the Blue Chip forecast.  The consensus outlook is for GDP growth of 3.1 percent in 2005 and for the CPI to rise 16 of 118   2.4 percent next year.  Not surp risingly, a number of the partic ipants in the symposium make a living in the auto industry .  Their outlook for light ve hicle sales in 2005  is 16.8 million  units, a pace virtually unchanged from 20 04.  If the Big Three c ontinue to lose market share, this pace would imply declines in their sales, an d such declines would be a challenge for our District, given the heavy presence of Big Three production.  Two of our directors, who are major parts suppliers, are working off the assumption that Big Three producti on in the first quarter will be 7 percent below that of a year ago but said  they wouldn’t be surprised if the actu al cuts were as mu ch as 10 percent. Turning to the national outlook, on balance the data we have received during the past few weeks haven’t materially changed our views about  the economy.  We continue to expect that growth will averag e a bit above potential over the forecast period.  Our best guess is that there is still some meaningful resource slack in the economy, so our ou tlook for inflation is relatively benign.  The fact that higher prices for energy and other inputs did not ma rkedly boost core inflation is certainly consistent with this view.  With regard to risks, I’m still concerned th at factors such as  high energy prices and business caution could continue to hold ba ck growth in job crea tion.  However, I’m also concerned about some inflation risk.  We know that  there is a great deal  of uncertainty about the size of resource gaps.  What if they’re no t as large as we th ink?  After all, we’ve been expecting big increases in employment as the gaps in labor markets shrink.  But it has been three years since the recession ended, and even in the years sinc e employment began to head up, pa yrolls have increased only a bit faster than the working-age popula tion, and labor force participation ha s been flat during this period.  It’s possible that this is as good as it gets.  Th e participation rates simply may have overshot trend in the late ’90s by more than  we thought and, therefor e, the rate may not rise much above its current level.  The answer to this question regarding resource gaps is not obvious at this time, as David 17 of 118   mentioned in his comments.  But we  cannot rule out the possibility that there is less resource slack in the economy than  we think and that we’ve been reading the inflation data with too much complacency.  Whether inflation picks up during th e next eight quarters or after the next eight quarters, either scenar io would be of concern.  Of course, even if we discoun t this risk, policy is still highly accommodative, so at this me eting my view is that we should continue on our current course.  It’s still too early to signal an  imminent pause; that  will be a key ques tion for next year.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.  My contacts ar e essentially saying that they could just replay the tape from our November conversations.  The situation is not much changed; the outlook remains pr etty favorable.  Let me co mment particularly on some  evidence on demand in the labor market.  When I was talking to my cont acts at the time of th e last FOMC meeting, a number of them noted the strengt h of demand in the technical ar ea—both IT and accounting—and demand for MBAs.  So wh at I did this time was to call placement directors at two MBA programs, and I thought those conversations gave me some interesting insight s into what’s going on in that regard.  One of the programs is what I think we’d call a first-tier MBA prog ram.  The number of companies that came  to that campus reach ed a recent high of 222 in th e fall of 2000.  By 2002, the number had dropped to 126.   It was 149 last year and 169 this y ear.  So there has been a very substantial increase in the number of companies coming to hire.  A contact at a second-tier program had the same kind of info rmation, with the number  of firms recruiting on their campus up 12 to 15 percent over last year.  Particularly notewort hy was the fact that co nsulting firms are coming back into the market, which hadn’t occurred for a good long time.  At the lower skill level, my Wal-Mart contact says  that they continue  to have loads of applicants  for positions as associates 18 of 118   when they open new st ores.  So I think that the labor market is be ginning to tighten at the upper skill levels. On the overall outlook , I agree with the Greenbook, s ubject to the usual caveats about standard errors.  I think it’s import ant to understand that the expansion is not fragile.  I think there’s a growing amount of business conf idence, forward planning, and ma ybe even very early signs of exuberance when you look at the recovery of IPOs and at merger and acquis ition activity.  And the demand for employees at the higher skill levels su ggests that companies are really geari ng up, with a pretty solid outlo ok going forward. I do think that the inflation risk s are tilted slightly to the upside .  I don’t fores ee an outbreak of inflation, but if we’re going to see a miss there, I thin k it’s more likely to be  on the upside than the downside.  If we view changes in oil pri ces and exchange rates as  exogenous shocks—and certainly the timing has to be viewed as exog enous—then we would exp ect over time a gradual absorption of the pressures that ar e coming from them.  Those effects look pretty pervasive; they are spread throughout the economy.  I think a better view of what’s going on here is  that oil and exchange rates should be regarded as fundamentall y endogenous variables a nd that they reflect an environment of expansionary policy continued over a sustained period of time.  I believe we’re on a good course to prevent that fr om getting out of hand, but thos e are two very, very important influences on the price perform ance of the economy going forw ard.  The pass-throughs occur slowly, but they do occur eventually.  Therefore, I thin k we should not relax simply because recent oil prices are off their highs.  The long-term oil future s are up about 50 perc ent or more from where they were a few years ago.   So there has been a very important fundamental change , I think, in the economics in that ma rket.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Yellen.  19 of 118  

[SECTION]

 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Eco nomic activity in the District is  expanding at a moderately strong pace, closely mirroring that in the natio n.  Housing markets remain especially robust, and consumer spending at stores and on trav el is solid.  The high volume of international trade flowing through the District has resulted in backlogs at our ports in southern California.  In addition, there have been some re ports that firms are facing difficu lty in getting access to enough trucks and railroad cars.  Not surprisingly, shipping prices have risen. Turning to the national economy, I’ve been h eartened by recent economic data, which for the most part have been positi ve.  The November employment repor t was disappointing, but taken in the context of the last  several months of job growth and othe r data, I have become more confident that the economy has found solid footing. Looking forward, the de cline in the dollar and the recent re treat in oil prices add further support to aggregate demand.  Even  so, it is notable that output growth so far has only moderately exceeded potential despite huge doses of fiscal and monetary medicine.  And the Greenbook, though more upbeat this time than last, forecasts a similar pattern fo r 2005, even with  only a gradual removal of monetary accommodation.  Turning to inflation, the 2005 Greenbook forecast of core PCE inflation of about 1½ percent and core CPI inflation of 2 percent strikes me as very reasonabl e.  In support of this view, our contacts tell us that consumer pr ices remain relatively  stable.  Indeed, our contacts see continued competitive pressures to  control costs.  Such pr essures were evident in la bor negotiations  at grocery stores in southern California earlier this year and more recently at major ho tels in the Bay area.  I see the risks to inflation from uncer tainty about the future paths of the dollar and oil prices.  Another risk, which I’ve mentione d before, relates to the high markup of  prices over unit labor costs.  A reversion to more-normal levels could result in a si gnificant reduction in the rate of inflation.  20 of 118   Finally, what happens to producti vity growth is also important for the inflation outlook, as the Greenbook alternative si mulations demonstrate. I would like to focus th e remainder of my comments on pr oductivity and its  implication for inflation and monetary polic y.  As we discussed at the last m eeting, the recent moderation in the pace of price declines for high-tech goods, coupl ed with weakness in high-tech investment last quarter, hints at the possibility of le ss-robust productivity gr owth going forward.  If this turns out to be the case, we would ex pect some upward pressure on infl ation.  I would like to emphasize, however, that there is a real chance that productivi ty growth over the next few years will come in higher than anticipated in the Green book.  Over the past four years, labor productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector has aver aged nearly 4 percent—about 1½ percentage points above its pace over 1996-2000, in spite of a shar p drop-off in capital deepening afte r 2000.   Some people argue that improved productivity growth since 2000 is largely temporary and will reverse over the next few years.  For example, the recent  surge in productivity  may reflect the fact that businesses have been extremely cautious in adding workers.  Proponen ts of this view expect caution to dissipate and productivity growth to slow as firms b ecome more confident about the outlook. But if business caution in making long-term commitments were the primary motive for weak job growth, we would expect—but do not see—employment expanding along ot her margins, such as the workweek.  One reason for optimism about the underlying produc tivity trend is that multifactor produc tivity during the second ha lf of the 1990s was probably greater than estimates derived from standard growth a ccounting.  We now realize that  a considerable amount of the investment during the late 1990s had a low or even a negative rate  of return, bias ing up standard estimates of the contribution to produc tivity growth from capital deepening. 21 of 118   Moreover, all signs suggest that businesses ar e continuing to adapt and reorganize their practices in order to take  full advantage of the opportunities afforded by new ICT technologies, and this process seems likely to continue playing out for some time.  For exam ple, one of our major banks indicated that through ongoing use of technolo gy they have been able to support growth in customers and services with fewe r staff.  A further example is  the continuing  expansion of Wal-Mart and other big box stores—a  trend that has had a dramatic effect on productivity growth in the retail and wholesale sectors. Finally, there is evidence suggesting that the extraordinarily high rates of investment during the second half of the 1990s were disruptive to  businesses.  According to one estimate, such adjustment costs reduced productivity growth about  ½ percentage point during that period.  All in all, it’s entirely possible that productivity growth, both structural and actual, could average around 3¼ percent over the next two years, as in an a lternative Greenbook simulation.  This pace is about equal to the average rate of productivity growth during the last  seven years, including periods of both high and low investment.  In the Greenbook simulation that combines such a step-up in productivity growth and a declinin g markup, inflation falls  to ¾ percent in the second half of next year and remains at that level.  Such an outcome is  troubling, given our conc erns about the effects of deflation and difficulties in  conducting monetary  policy in such an environment. So, in summary, I consider the 2.7 percent Greenbook estimate  of structural productivity growth as reasonable and the risks to inflation as balanced.  But there is significant upside productivity potential and associated downside risks to inflation.  Given the costs of an unexpected and substantial decline in inflation, these risks sh ould be a significant concer n.  For today’s meeting, it seems entirely sensible to raise the funds rate 25  basis points and to craft a statement that leaves our options open to eventualities. 22 of 118

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Than k you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Third District continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Reports from our  manufacturers have been mostly positive.  Our November business outlook survey (BOS) index of general activity stood at 20.7, which was down slightly from October.  However,  the index in our December BOS, which will be released Thursday, has rebounded to 29.6.  So we’re still seeing expansio n in the region’s manufacturing sector.  The new orders and shipme nts indexes remain at healthy levels, and the employment index continues to strengthen. Looking beyond our formal surv eys, retail sales of general merchandise in our region are showing continued moderate  growth this holiday season, at a pace consistent with retailers’ expectations.  This growth  has been in most store types and me rchandise lines.  Retailers in our region expect current dollar holiday sales this year to be 4 percent higher than last year, which is similar to the National Re tail Federation’s forecast of a 4.5 perc ent gain.  On the margin, however, sales of luxury goods continue to  show better year-over-year increases than sales of other items.  Turning to construction, nonresidential constr uction remains soft.  We had a bit of an improvement last month, but it was fleeting.  It’s probably best to describe this sector as having bottomed out without any kind of sustained improvem ent yet.  Nonetheless, commercial real estate firms expect office vacancy rates to move down somewhat in the year ahead in  most parts of the region.  At the same time, they continue to report declines in effective rents, as landlords compete for new tenants and lease renewals.  As a result, some commercial real estate investors are becoming concerned that prices for buildings have risen to a level inconsistent with the underlying fundamentals. 23 of 118   In the residential real estate s ector, prices continue to accelerate in each of  the three states in our region.  Area builders report that they are ra ising prices for new homes, in contrast to some other parts of the nation where it is reported that developers are beginning to cut prices or offer discounted upgrades as incentives to spur sales.   Looking ahead, builders and real estate agents expect the pace of sales to remain  roughly steady.  They anticipa te rising employment and incomes to cushion the effect of increases in mortgage rates as long as the upturn in rates does not exceed 1 or 2 percentage points. Payroll employment in each of our three states  grew in October, the latest month for which we have state-level data.  Growth in October wa s somewhat slower than in the second and third quarters, but payrolls went up in all major indu stry groups except manu facturing and information services.  Employment growth in Ne w Jersey and Delaware continues to outpace that of the nation.  Pennsylvania continues to exhibit the weakest labo r market in our region.  Looking ahead, our staff forecast calls for moderate accel eration in employment growth and a decline in unemployment rates in each of our three states over the next year. On the inflation front, some reports suggest increasing indu strial goods price pressure.  This is what we hear from our board, an d this is what busine sses are reporting in their comments to us around the District.  In our busi ness outlook survey, the price indexes remained at high levels, and firms reported higher pr ices for their own manufactured good s and higher production costs.  For example, more than 90 percent of the executives polled in ou r November BOS expected prices of raw materials, including energy, to increase next y ear.  In all, the outlook among our contacts in the region’s business community is positive.  They exp ect growth to continue at about its current pace through the winter. 24 of 118   Turning to the nation, data released since ou r last meeting have ge nerally been on the positive side.  Household spending  and business investment have been revised upward, suggesting positive momentum.  Recent retail sales numbers were  encouraging.  Housing construction remains relatively strong, and ma nufacturing remains on solid footin g.  While the November employment report was a bit on the soft  side, the pattern of payr oll growth over the past several months, allowing for the usual monthly volatility of  the data, shows continued impr ovement in the labor market.  Payroll growth has averaged over 185,000 jobs per month so far this year, ab out in line with the forecasts.  While there likely is still some slack in labor markets, this is being worked off.  By the way, for those of you who put some value in the NAIRU model, the recent staff analysis of NAIRU estimates at our Bank suggests that  there may be less slack in the la bor market than we assumed.  The other positive developmen ts for aggregate demand since the last meeting are the decline in oil prices and the depreciation of the dollar, as we know. My outlook for economic growth is broadly consistent with that of the Greenb ook.  I, too, expect growth in the neighborhoo d of 4 percent next year, and I’m  more comfortable with the fed funds rate path built into  this Greenbook than I was with the path of the la st one.  However, even with the steeper funds rate path , I see somewhat more inflation risk.  The dollar could depreciate more and the pass-through to final prices could be larger than  is incorporated into the baseline forecast.  I do recall that we di scussed at our last meeting the wo rldwide phenomenon  of a reduction in the pass-through rate.  Nonetheless, I think we need to list this as  a risk to our forecast.  In this regard, as David Stockton noted,  five-year inflation compensation based on the Treasury indexed security has moved up, even whil e six-to-ten-year inflation compen sation has been stable.  One interpretation of the divergence is that the markets believe that the FOMC will respond to inflationary pressures and keep prices stable in the long run, but only after we see that inflation has 25 of 118   risen.  I would prefer that we be  more forward-looking than this implies.  This, of course, argues for maintaining our strategy of gradually removing policy accommodati on to bring policy back to a neutral stance.  The facts are th at policy remains accommodative, the forecast is for continued growth in the neighborhood of 4 perc ent, and there is some positive in flation risk.  Al l this suggests to me that it is prudent to continue on our upw ard path for the funds rate. Before closing, I’d like to point out that th e Bluebook’s measure of the real fed funds rate uses lagged core PCE.  By this measure, we have made some progre ss in moving the real funds rate north.  However, ex ante measures of the real rate, based on the forecast of inflation, show less progress by the Committee in re moving policy accommo dation.  I would as k the Committee to remember 1994.  At that time, the FOMC waited to see a year’s worth of strong employment data before starting to rais e rates, on the grounds  that falling inflation meant that  the real rate  was rising.  Then once the FOMC started to incr ease rates, it had to do so quite sharply over the year.  Of course, this time we began raising rates earlier than  last time, which may allow us to follow a more gradual path.  However, remember, this time inflation ha s been increasing, and the real rate has been moving up only a little .  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  The meetings with our Sixth District boards of directors were particularly timely this cycle, just concluding at th e end of last week .  I would note three issues and impressions that  came from those discussions. First, the directors’ general outlook for the economy was decidedly positive and more solid and broad-based than has been the case for some time .  There even seem to be some new stirrings in commercial real estate.  And more  of our bankers are reporting so me increase in business lending, especially in small and middle mark ets.  I was particularly struck by the degree to  which much of 26 of 118   the business caution that remain s was attributed by many to all of the time and attention being devoted to the Sarbanes–Oxley go vernance work.  One gets the sens e that, once some of the initial adjustment to that legislation is behind us, perhaps—just perhaps—some of the caution we have talked so much about will begin to dissipate. Second, I was struck by the degree of talk about  price increases that had been put in place or were being planned.  While some of  those were directly attributed to  the cost of oil and other energy costs, there was just more wide spread conversation about the de termination to get some price adjustment. Third, I was intrigued by an oil price observation from one of our New Orleans directors, who is a senior executive for one of the largest U.S. chemical companies.   I had been under the impression that less-developed countries like  China, because they are “energy efficiency disadvantaged,” would be relatively more hurt by the past rise of oil prices than the United States.  However, this director related that, during a recent  visit to China to discuss a new joint venture plant to produce an input to the manufacture of plastic goods, his staff couldn’t reconcile the financials that were being presented.  The reason was that the energy price assumpti on in those projections seemed to be unreasonably low.  To make a long story short, the Ch inese were using oil prices that were about $10 less a barrel than West Texas intermediate  crude.  When queried  about this, it seems that the refineries built in developi ng Asia over the last fifteen year s were designed to process sour crude, which is presently tr ading at a price that is $8 to $10 below that of sweet cr ude.  This means that the area has a temporary, as well as a potentia l absolute, energy price advantage.  Sour crude is not in short supply.  More over, U.S. plants can’t handle it.  Th e story seems totally  consistent with the discussion in the Greenbook of substantial diff erences in the prices of sour and sweet crude. 27 of 118   At the national level, I find myself characterizing the pace of growth as somewhat more robust than the “moderate pace” language we used in our post-F OMC statement last time.  With GDP having expanded at an averag e of more than 4 perc ent for the past six qua rters and a forecast for more of the sa me, I think we could be even more positive  in describing the pa th we seem to be on.  Although we continue to puzzle and even worry about job growth , as Tony just noted we have averaged about 185,000 new jobs a month over the pa st eleven months.  This  has been enough to allow the unemployment rate to drift lower over the course of the year.  Although continued productivity gains and a general re luctance by busi nesses to hire until abso lutely necessary suggest that a substantially greater base of new job creation is probably not likely, we should continue to make further gains in working down the unemployment rate unless we have significant changes in the participation rate or  in immigration policy. I cannot point to any alarming  developments with respect to inflation, but the anecdotal reports I just shared from across our  District suggest a possible shift in the prospects for widespread price increases, and that gives me pa use.  I’d also note that five-t o-ten-year inflation expectations, while reasonably well anc hored, have drifted up steadily in 2003  and 2004 to near ly 2¾ percent. Finally, the substantial run-up in house prices , which we have followed in Florida and also see in the populous Northeast and West Coast of the United States, may be at least partially attributable to unusually low mortgage rates in fluenced by our very accommodative policy, which has been in place for some  time.  Those developments and the ri sks associated with the run-up in house prices probably deserve further study and thought as we decide how to posture policy.  I continue to be comfortable with the policy path we’re on.  And barring some surprise, I judge that we still have a considerable way to go to get back to a more ne utral stance.  My concern is that, with a real fed funds rate that continues to be near zero, we could unintentionally be 28 of 118   encouraging further imbalances in both the inflati on environment and in the international sector.  I hope we will not try to signal th at we may soon pause in our removal of policy accommodation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  New England’ s economy continues to improve at a reasonable pace.  Em ployment is growing, an d all states report j ob levels above those of a year ago.  Unempl oyment dropped sharply in the region in September and ma intained a rate about 1 percentage point below that of the nation in October as well, so it wasn’t just a fluke. Despite this, concerns  remain, as reflected in a new softening in consumer and business confidence.  Major industry groups, in particul ar manufacturing and information se rvices, continue to lose jobs compared with a year ago.  Financial activities posted a small loss as well, and the large professional and business services sector was flat, in major contrast to th e picture nationally.  The region seems to be buffeted by the ups and downs in IT spending on both equipment and software and the impact of continued consolidation in financial services.  Ma nufacturing export growth slowed in the third quarter after a strong second quar ter, even with the decline in the dollar.  With the Fleet/Bank of America and Manu life/John Hancock mergers, down town office vacancy rates in Boston widened a bit, in contrast with the nation as a whole, and rents declined. On a more positive note, the fall tourism seas on was apparently a go od one.  And casual observations of malls during this holiday season suggest that consum ers are spending at a good clip, despite the confidence readings.  Re tail contacts report solid readings on sales, and housing markets remain strong, though  some softness at the hi gh end continues.  First District business service companies report improved conditi ons, with demand strengthening for temporary employment firms, particularly in the areas of engineering and IT.  Beyond temporary se rvices, software and IT 29 of 118   employers also saw demand growth, though the uncertainty I noted before continued to weigh on their outlook.  Even with the overall rather tepid employment picture, especially as  it relates to levels of job growth, hi ghly skilled labor remains in short su pply, and firms re port difficulty in hiring the right employ ee for key positions. Turning to the nation, growth seems remarkably  good.  After a pause on the consumer side in the late spring or early summer, consumer spe nding and business invest ment show considerable strength overall.  High-tech  spending has fallen off a bit, to be sure, but that appare ntly reflects an inventory turn in that industry.  Labor markets are bouncy, but for the past six to nine months or so they seem to have been delivering an average monthl y level of job growth that  will actually reduce, if not eliminate, slack in labor markets over the next year and a half to two years.  Increased housing wealth and a decrease in the price of oil puts money in consumer pockets as we ll.  Financial markets are supportive of continuing growth , with equity markets turning up and longer-term interest rates and spreads low.  Indeed, the pr oliferation of hedge funds and the narrowness of credit spreads suggest that liquidity abounds, which could have its obvi ous downside.  Even the fall of the dollar hasn’t seemed to do much more than provide, through its  stimulative effect, some greater assurance that output will not be over ly affected by wa ning fiscal stimulus in 2005. Our forecast, like that of the Greenbook, sees this rather halcyon  current situation continuing through 2005 and into 2006, with  excess capacity gradually disappearing, unemployment at least stable but likely trending down, co re inflation relatively flat, and overall inflation at less than 2 percent.  Now, as I co nsider both of these forecasts, I am re minded of Dave’s crossed fingers and also the reggae tune “Don’t Worr y, Be Happy.”  Even when the Greenbook considers alternative scenarios, it has to work to  get much variation in outc ome.  Yet real risks are out there; it’s just not easy to see them in the context an d period of our forecasts.  For one, anecdotes cont inue to abound 30 of 118   about increased pricing pr essure due to rising im port prices—not only for oil but other commodities as well—and increased costs of labor.  It’s hard to make our forecasts anticipate much inflation pressure, however, largely because of the embedd ed assumptions about the size of the output gap and the related strong structural productivity grow th.  I think it may be wi se to be humble about those assumptions.  Another risk involves the fiscal deficit.  The latest government appropriations bill may have reined in spending and reduced the deficit in the short run.  Bu t it’s hard to see how the federal deficit can remain co ntained, given reasonable assump tions about discre tionary spending growth; the resolution of the growing negative e ffect of the AMT (altern ative minimum tax); the likely continuation of the Bush tax cuts; and the li kely continuation, unfort unately, of the Iraq War, not to mention plans to address Social Security. In part reflecting this, the value of the do llar has declined.  It may be  likely to fall more as the country’s current acco unt deficit approaches new highs as a percent of GDP.  The differential impact of this depreciation, boos ting U.S. growth but hitting the euro and the euro-area growth harder than elsewhere, can only exacerbate a very touchy international situat ion strained already by differing attitudes toward th e war, among other things .  Growth in the rest of the world has slipped in the context of rising oil prices  and the dollar’s decline.  And a needed adjustment  in the Chinese currency, which could help things in As ia, seems unlikely or at least remote.  So I find myself in a bit of a quandary.  Are things as good  as they seem in the forecast before us, or do we stand an increasing chance of a very unpleasant, though possibly unforecastable, surprise?  And in what direction will that surprise push economic activity—to increas ed inflation, slower growth, in creased market instability , or some combinatio n of all of these? I’m having some trouble figurin g out how to close th is.  [Laughter]  I do sense increased risks out there.  On the other hand , I don’t think there’s an y choice for us at this meeting.  I think 31 of 118   that the U.S. economy  is on an upward trajectory and that polic y has to come out of  its current very accommodative stance.  In effect, as I look at both sides of the risks here, I think our moving in that direction makes the econom y internally a little more resilient.  It takes a b it more thinking on the part of markets to deal w ith risks in an environment of rising in terest rates.  And I believe that’s the right way for us to go over the near term, thou gh I do think we need to be cautious about an increasing set of risks, both natio nally and internationally.  Frankly,  as for what we say, I would like to take it down to as  little as possible ab out forward-looking th ings and make it as  clean and clear as we possibly can.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO.  Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.  I want to start my co mments this morning with a somewhat troubling statis tic, and that is that the PNC Bank’s Tw elve Days of Christmas price index jumped 2.4 percent.  It has been reported that a surge in French hen pr ices more than offset a modest drop in th e cost of turtle doves.  [Laughter]  If you look at thei r core index, which I’m told excludes the high ly volatile swans-a-swimming compon ent, that index was actually up 3.1 percent from a year ago.  [Laughter] With that, I’ll turn to my District report.  In  my report at our last  meeting, I noted that business activity in the Fourth District did not seem representative of what we’ve be en hearing at the national level.  And judging by  the most recent Beige Book, my region still seems to be more economically challenged than the rest of the na tion.  During the interm eeting period, I spent a significant amount of time talk ing to members of the business  community.  And from my conversations, I sense a continued disconnect betwee n the strong growth repor ts that I’m getting, especially from the larger international manufacturers, and the c ontinued soggy performance of our District’s labor markets.  Companies report that a lo t of growth in orders and production is taking 32 of 118   place.  It just isn’t always being met with much job growth, and indeed, the activity itself isn’t always occurring in the F ourth District.  Firms that report am ple capacity are se eing some squeeze in profit margins as they are able only to partially pass along some of their rising costs to customers.  Others have been able to maintain their profits  by finding yet more wa ys to absorb the cost pressures through productivity enhancements.  An d some businesses that are feeling capacity constraints, including the steel producers and the capital goods makers, say they are actually successfully passing cost pressures up the production lines. But where I might ordinarily hear  that these firms that are at  capacity are gearing up to expand their local production capabilities, what I’m now commonly hearing are stories that these firms are choosing instead to expa nd their production capacity abro ad, especially in Southeast Asia and China.  One interpreta tion of this informat ion is that some industries are still in th e midst of a rather wrenching and likely protracted structural change, and the Fourth Di strict is as close to ground zero in that transformati on as one can get.  It may take  a long time yet before we see sustained significant employment gains in our area .  And while this global  realignment is under way, I think it might be more challenging than usual to accurately judge capacity utilization and inflationary break points. If I’ve been following the past several Greenbooks correctly, the staff has had to put more monetary restraint into its projections to hold th e inflation rate steady, because over the next two years it now seems that aggregate demand is growing somewhat faster and cyclical productivity is growing somewhat slower than previously.  I fo und the alternative scenarios about productivity growth and cost pass-throughs to be very informat ive as I thought about the risks to  the outlook.  Each of these variables, of  course, is very difficult to predict.  I am more optimistic  than the baseline Greenbook projections about productivity because  of the comments I’ve be en hearing from my 33 of 118   business contacts.  But I am also  hearing from my business contacts that they are having greater success in passing costs along to their customer s.  These forces, of course, have offsetting implications for the inflation outlook, and they do bear close scrutiny in the months ahead. We have been removing our policy accommodation  at a gradual and steady pace.  As we’ve done so, I have become more satisfi ed about the balance of  risks to our goals.  Clearly, there are uncertainties about how the economic situation is evolving, and my pr eference in this environment is to avoid the risk of unexpected increases in inflation.  I am fa irly confident that  the economy is going to continue to expa nd at a pace that’s consistent with a rising equilibrium real rate over time, and I think it’s a good  idea for people to expect that environment until we  see strong evidence to the contrary.  So I think that  today we should take the steps that the market anticipates , and I would also make as few changes as possible to our statement.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, let me start brie fly with my reaction to the national economy where I think, as discussed in th e Greenbook, growth remains above trend and, barring unexpected events, is likely to remain above trend for the next couple of years.  If this is correct, we will gradually approach our l ong-run potential GDP.  More specifically, we expect that growth will be near but slightly below 4 percent this year and next.  With trend growth of about 3¼ percent, we estimate that we approach potentia l at the rate of about ¾ percentage  point per year.  This outlook is similar, as I said, to the Greenb ook and to the December  Blue Chip consensus forecast as well.   Several factors obviously contribute to this; they’ve been mentioned, and I’ll only touch on them.  They include our continued accommodative mo netary policy, strong consumer spending that seems to be continuing, and labor markets that are in better shape than we thought—34 of 118   notwithstanding, as some have commented, the recent claims numbers.  Moreover, wealth is higher, as reflected in the stock market and housing pric es.  And, of course, oil prices have declined. I think the evidence from our District supports this out look.  Headed into Thanksgiving, retailers were generally optimistic about the holiday shopping se ason.  Almost a ll of the mall managers we contacted just last week said the holiday season had gotten off to a good, though not spectacular, start, with traffic an d sales up several percentage point s from a year ago.  Travel and tourism activity have also been ve ry solid, and Rock y Mountain resort owners  expect a big increase in foreign ski visits this winter  due to the lower dolla r.  In addition, manu facturing firms remain quite optimistic about future activity and plan moderate incr eases in capital spending and employment during the firs t half of next year. Let me briefly mention our ag ricultural economy, which will enjoy a re cord-breaking year in 2004.  Farm income is 25 per cent above last year’s record high and 50 percent above previous 2004 estimates.  With historical ly high livestock prices, the bulk of the income gains have come from that sector.  In addition, cr op production for corn, soybeans, wheat, and so forth, was up 12 to 25 percent this year, with corn an d soybean producers posting record years.  Even with these large supplies, prices remain well above their ten-year average.  This re cord farm income  has translated into higher land values.  In the Tenth District, ranc h land values have soared  10 percent above levels of a year ago.  Non-i rrigated cropland values are up 7 percent from a year ago, and irrigated cropland values are up 5 percent.  As a result, equipment sales are also surging.  For example, in Finally, analysts expect equipment sales to increa se in December, as farmers and ranchers take advantage of purchases to cut their tax bills. 35 of 118   Turning to the inflation outlo ok, inflation remains modest, although there are some signs that it may be rising, as others have noted.  Core  PCE inflation is 1½ per cent over the most recent twelve-month period, and co re CPI inflation is 2 percent.  We have seen some increases in core inflation over the last coup le of months.  In additio n, as others have noted, even though five- to ten-year inflation compensation remains relatively stable, five-year infla tion compensation has increased.  Finally, while  oil prices have decreased—a positiv e—the dollar continue s on balance to depreciate.  District manufacturers continue to expect upward pressure on producer prices.  For the twelfth month in a row, a net positive percentage of  firms raised output pr ices; this follows three straight years of constant or falling output prices.  In addition, the future finished goods price index rose to its second highest reading on record in November, trailing only the peak of  April 2004.  With sluggish employment growth and increased layoffs, wage pressures do remain slight.   These results, on balance, suggest to me at least that we should continue steadily moving the federal funds rate closer to what we might consider a long-run neutral level.  In addition, I would submit that the risk of higher inflation than in  the Greenbook baseline is  large enough that we should be thinking about continuing to raise rate s on a systematic basis—and by more than assumed in the Greenbook.  First,  the Greenbook forecasts th at the output gap will be  eliminated  by the end of 2006 and that core PCE inflatio n will be 1½ percent or just under that, and yet the real fed funds rate is only 1.85 percent.  Sin ce this is below the Bo ard staff’s medium-run equilibrium fed funds rate—what I’ll call neutral—we shou ld expect higher inflation be ginning in 2006.   Second, we know that all forecasts have erro r bands, and the Greenbook provi des enough information that we can calculate the probability  that the output gap is eliminated in 2005 or ea rly 2006.  I would submit that the probability is large enou gh that we should be  concerned about highe r inflation in these years.  And third, the fe deral funds rate remains below neutral for the entir e forecast period.  My 36 of 118   point is that the output gap is being eliminated and, wh en this occurs, the risk of inflation, of course, rises.   Therefore, I think we should be  moving the federal funds rate at a fairly steady pace toward the lower bound at least of  estimates of neutral—barring any shoc ks, of course.  Once we get close to what most consider the lower bound of neutral, we can become more cautious at that point and begin to speak of pauses.  I’d subm it, however, that we are not yet at that poi nt and that we should not become overly cautious at this time.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Th e Fifth District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent weeks.  Ou r service firms reported solid growth in revenues over the last two months, wh ile retailers told us that  sales have been flat.  In particular, big ticket sales remain weak, and car sales are said to be soft. District manufacturers reported that growth in shipments and new orders  have tailed off over the last month.  Shipments were basically flat in November.  Although build ing permits we re off the pace of a year ago, housing markets remained genera lly strong in our District.  In labor markets, our information indicates job gains in services and retail bu t virtually unchanged manufacturing employment in November.  Price in creases at District firms have trended higher, though they are generally remaining under 2 percen t, according to our contacts.  There was a no table change  in the tone in manufacturing firms regarding pricing, ho wever.  They are now increasingly saying that they can pass through price increa ses to their customers, unlike earlie r in the year wh en they said price increases were more difficult to pass along. Turning to the national picture, data received in recent weeks also indicate that economic recovery has continued at a reasona bly healthy pace.  Consumer spending has advanced at a pretty 37 of 118   solid trend rate in recent months, capital spending has been fair ly brisk, and housi ng keeps coming in on the strong side.  Every pass ing month of growth at this pace  raises my confidence in the staying power of the e xpansion.  The Gr eenbook expects real GDP to  expand around 3½ to 4 percent through 2006, and the output gap is expected  to close gradually by then, with PCE inflation remaining stable around 1½ per cent.  This is a re latively attractive outlo ok, and it’s one I’m comfortable subscribing to. I was particularly relieved to see the eliminatio n of the disconnect that was in the November Greenbook between the staff’s proj ection and market expectations regarding th e future path of the federal funds rate.  Since the November meeting, that disconnect has been resolved through an increase of about ½ percentage point in the Greenbook’s  projected rate path , putting it only a little below market expectations of the future funds rate.  Th is was a favorable way of closing the gap, since it was accompanied by an upw ard revision in expected growth  in the Greenbook and reflects more confidence in th e strength of the recovery going forward.   Another disconnect remains, however, that even tually must be reso lved.  The Greenbook sees CPI inflation leveli ng off at about 1¾ perc ent in 2006, and yet the Greenbook also reports survey estimates of ten-y ear-ahead expected CPI inflation in th e 2½ to 3 percent range.  Moreover, the Bluebook reports expectations measures of  between 2½ and 3 percent based on inflation-indexed Treasury spre ads.  So it seems that a ra nge of measures ar e telling us that in flation will be noticeably greater than we th ink it will be.  This inflation disco nnect will be resolv ed eventually one way or another, as I said.  We may get lucky an d see market expectations drift down to a level consistent with 1¾ percent on the CPI, or we may not be so lucky. One interpretation of the persistence of inflation expectatio ns at these leve ls is that the public believes that our long-run tolerance range fo r CPI inflation extends up to 3 percent or more.  38 of 118   If that’s the case, it may be difficult for us to re sist an upward drift in inflation as the economy recovers.  Moreover, we can’t be sure that expected inflation won’t drif t up still further, if actual inflation begins to drift up.  But if we’re unwilling to tolerate CPI inflation near 3 percent, then we the public’s expectation of inflation and ou rs is resolved in ou r favor.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Comments from dire ctors and from a wide range of contacts indicate further im provement in the District eco nomy—indeed some  acceleration recently—and the improvement is quite broadly base d.  Given that, let me just comment on a couple of developments that seem particularly relevant.  There have been in the Di strict sustained, albeit moderate, gains in employment for better than a year now.  Hiring plans are positive, according to our most recent survey, and some skills are now in  short supply.  The invest ment outlook appears to have improved recently.  Some projects that were on the back burner, according to business contacts, have now been moved forward.  In gene ral, I think businessmen are feeling a bit more upbeat, and that is fueling some enthusiasm for fu rther investment.  The fi nal point I would mention about the District economy is that, despite tightenin g labor markets, wage increases remain subdued—generally in the 2 to 3 percent range—and price pr essures are modest as well. As far as the national economy is concerned, I think it’s perhaps at least worth noting that the current expansion is no w into its fourth year, and recently at  least things have been turning out pretty much as we e xpected.  Now, that might be a reason to worry, but I pr efer to look on the bright side of that.  I agree with a po int that Dave Stockton mentioned—t hat the fundamentals supporting further economic growth from here  forward are distinctly positive.   If I were writing down a GDP 39 of 118   forecast at the moment, I might write down something a little stronger th an the Greenbook forecast for both 2005 and 2006. On the inflation side, I do expect inflation to remain low, but I must  admit that I’m a little less confident about that th an I was a few months ago.   If I ask myself why, I think it has mostly to do with the dollar.  It’s  not so much that I’m concerned about the pass-through, narrowly defined; it’s really more a concer n about the changing  nature of the competitive environment implied by the that’s a pretty slim reed to hang  all that much on, so  I personally would stic k with a low inflation forecast for now. Having said all that, it seems to me that the policy course is pretty clear here.  We should continue with the policy path th at we’ve been on.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  First Vice President Holcomb. MS. HOLCOMB.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  Since the last  meeting, th ere is more evidence that the Texas recovery is solidly on track.  October employment grow th was the strongest since the end of last year, and the most recent Beige Book conf irms increased op timism in the business community.  This tone of optimism was rein forced by comments from our directors at last Thursday’s board meeting.  That was a meetin g of all four of our boards , and this positive view was seen across almost all regions of our District and the many industries repres ented by our directors. So far this year, th rough October, Texas employment is up an annualized rate of 1.3 percent, slightly less than in the nation.  Temporary employment jump ed sharply in October, mirroring a trend that was seen in th e nation.  That bodes well for the recovery as a leading indicator of future job growth.  Indeed, Beige Book contacts reported an unusual numb er of temporary workers finding permanent positions.  In addition, ou r directors reported increased hiri ng by various si zes of firms.  40 of 118   Reports from the high-tech sector ha ve been mixed.  There continue to be a number of layoffs at all types of high-tech firms, incl uding semiconductor production, telecommunications , and computer services.  However, this appears primarily to re flect continued reorganizi ng of the industry.  A director representing the tech sector reporte d improved profitability in  the industry and an expectation of a manageab le and sustainable growth rate of 5 to 10 percent in 2005.  Continued restructuring of the airline industry is providin g headwinds for the Texas recovery.  The state has three major air carriers reducing em ployment and wages.  This repr esents ongoing restructuring of the industry as well as specific plans aimed at offsetting high fuel costs.  Housing sales and prices softened slightly over the last six weeks, although  some areas of the state have seen no slowing in residential construction.  Our hous ing industry contacts ar e optimistic for next year but say that a stronger rate of job grow th is needed to meet sa les expectations.  Office markets have continued to improve over the last six weeks. Energy drilling activity has contin ued to improve in the District, with the industry reporting higher prices, growing backlogs of work, and some shortages of workers and equipm ent.  Global demand for oil has not been sufficient to sop up the increase in world oil output.  Slowing economic activity in Europe, Asia, an d Latin America is expected  to continue to put do wnward pressure on oil prices, as noted earlier, unless OPEC is able to curtail output.  Mild we ather in the natural-gas-consuming regions of the nation ha s pushed natural gas prices below $6.00.  Natural gas inventories are very high.  If we ha ve a relatively mild winter, natural gas prices could fall further.  The Texas leading index was down in October but has increased strong ly over the last thre e months.  The index is forecasting 2004 employment growth of just under 1.5 percen t and 2005 job growth of about 1.9 percent.  These rates are below historical leve ls but reflect the improving trend that will allow job growth to finally meet or  exceed that of the nation. 41 of 118   We are in basic agreement with the Greenbook fo recast of continued growth during the upcoming year.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast paints a similar picture, although it has a somewhat slower pace of growth.  The fall of the index of leading indicators over five consecutive months is becoming a minor source of concern.  Historically, declines of this size and duration have been associated with growth sl owdowns.  But given th e absence of signs of  a slowdown elsewhere in the data, the Dallas research staff has discounted the signal from the index of leading indicators.  Of some concern also are recent  developments on the inflation front, most notably the monthly numbers on core CPI infla tion in September and October.  Survey  and market measures of inflation expectations, both short-term and l ong-term, remain a bit higher than  preferred.  Given the expected inflation trajectory for 2005 and 20 06 shown in the Greenbook, r ecent inflation does not set off alarms. On balance, we favor a continuation of the recent monetary policy path with an increase in the funds rate at this m eeting.  Since the real fe deral funds rate is still below its long-term neutral level, we recognize that some ti ghtening will be needed.  Ultimately, two months of higher core CPI inflation numbers and a sm all uptick in the core PCE numbers are not likely to be a problem.  But if the markets see us pausing in the face of those numbers, that could create a problem.   And since the economy appears to still be on a solid growth path and monetary policy remains accommodative, this is not the time to pause.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m overwhelmed, as always, by the intelligence and imagin ation of the staff, [laughter] an d I don’t have too much to add.  Our view of the outlook hasn’t ch anged much since our last meeting, and we’re very close to the Greenbook on most dimensions of the forecast.  The sentiment in New York seems to have become 42 of 118   a bit more positive over the la st few months.  Our forthcoming Empire survey fo r December has very strong readings and shows a very substa ntial improvement in most measures—orders, shipments, employment, and general conditions. Nationally, we see more moment um in demand growth going in to the new year.  The main fundamentals of an expansion at slightly above trend gr owth seem intact.  Global demand growth is a little softer but s till pretty good.  Our fo recast for real GDP growth  remains between 3½ and 4 percent for ’05 and ’06, with core PCE in the neighborhood of 1½ percent, with a path for monetary policy close to that now reflected in the market .  We see the risks as roughly balanced around this forecast, with a bit less downside risk to growth and somewhat greater probability of a higher inflation outcome than we thought a few months ago. We’re at least one quar ter and perhaps two quarters now into a different constellation of factors affecting inflation fundamentals:  productiv ity growth slowing signif icantly, unit labor costs rising at a rate perhaps slightly ab ove that of core PCE, and margins starting to co me in a b it.  Even allowing for the normal fog that surrounds these judgments, this constellation of factors seems likely to continue over at least part of the fore cast period.  This transiti on comes on top of an environment with significant other cost pressures in  the pipeline, a declining dollar, a smaller output gap—with the gap perhaps now within the margin of error—and demand growth, as I said, slightly above trend.  Inflation expectations are sticking at a level somewhat above what we consider comfortable or consistent with our im plicit inflation target, ev en though they have come  off a bit since our last meeting.  So in th is context, I think the overall stance of  monetary policy should continue to be directed at moving the r eal fed funds rate higher, with a significant positive slope to the path of the fed funds rate for th e forecast period.  I don’t see a compelling reason to  seek to alte r the market’s 43 of 118   expectations today for the near-ter m path of the funds ra te.  This suggests a signal today that is neutral to present market expectations, which I thi nk implies very little cha nge to the structure or content of our statement. Now, would leaving market expectations un changed today risk leaving the stance of monetary policy too tight and jeopardize the expansion?  I think that seems unlikely.  Might we end up having to move further and faster in ’05 than is now priced into the futures path ?  Possibly.  On balance, I think the probab ility that we will end up moving along a path that  is slightly steeper than is now priced in seem s to exceed the probabilit y that we’d move on  a path that is so fter than what is now priced in.  But we don’t face that choice today.  I think the best way of avoiding a more damaging adjustment to balance sheets or a more damaging adjustment to the overall economy, as we move on this path to equilibr ium, is to continue to make sure we move far enou gh fast enough that we don’t raise the risk that we end up having to catch up and move more abruptly in response to a rise in expecta tions.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  As the Greenbook noted, the news on actual and prospective demand since the last meeting ha s been mostly on the pos itive side.  Consumption has proven surprisingly, at le ast to me, resilient to hi gher energy prices, supported by rising housing and equity wealth and continued low intermediate- and long-term interest rates.  The higher level of wealth and lower energy prices should bolster grow th going forward.  Abse nt a sharp move in the dollar, longer-term interest rates, wealth, or oil pric es, I don’t see any forces that are likely to shift recent demand patterns enou gh to throw economic activity off a tr ack that’s about in line with the staff forecast—that is, a gradual furt her erosion of slack as the federal funds rate rises on a trajectory similar to that exp ected by the market. 44 of 118   I think the more difficult questio n that many of us have been addressing at this meeting is what the inflation outlook would be that might accompany  such an output path.  As solid growth becomes more entrenched and the output gap narrows, the locus of our concern naturally tends to shift away from supporting growth and, other things being equal, th e balance of risks around stable inflation moves in the direction of faster price increases.  Among the other things that aren’t equal, however, is monetary polic y.  In effect, our policy tightening, bo th actual and expected, is designed to keep inflation down and those inflation risks ba lanced.  And in my view, so far the odds favor our success with a measured  pace of tightening. Concerns about higher inflation seem to be ba sed importantly on pipeline pressures, as reflected in more-rapid increases in PPIs at various levels of produc tion, on the effects of the lower dollar on import prices, a nd on the possibility of sl ower trend productivity gr owth, as well as on the most recent couple of months of core CPI data.  However, st aff briefings yesterday and a few months ago showed just how little of the pipeline pressures and dolla r depreciation tends to pass through to core consumer prices.  There’s a lot of uncertainty a bout structural productivity, as several of us have mentioned.  We’ve had only one quarter of slower pr oductivity growth after about half a dozen quarters of growth above the pr esumed trend.  And even a couple of quarters of slowdown in productivity gr owth would tell us  very little about underlying trends, especially if, as the staff believes, the leve l of productivity is abov e the long-run trend.   Moreover, a number of influen ces are weighing on the side of holding inflation down, and some of these have rece ived additional support in  recent months.  Increase s in nominal wages and compensation have remained  moderate despite the st rength in productivity gr owth in recent years and despite higher headline inflation of late.  To my mind, this te nds to confirm that there is, indeed, slack in labor markets.  Markups of prices over unit labor costs have stayed quite high through the 45 of 118   third quarter—near record levels  for nonfarm businesses—and these markups would be expected to absorb the initial cost effects of a slowdown in trend productivity should that oc cur, giving us time to react to oncoming cost pressu res.  And measures of long-ter m inflation expectations have remained remarkably stable. I don’t want to sound complacent here.  There are upside risks, but I believe if they do end up predominating, we will have time to react before  inflation rises ma terially.  And in my view they are balanced on the other side, so long as the ev idence continues to support the existence of slack that is disappearing only gradually and so long as long-term inflation expectations remain anchored.  Moreover, I don’t see the cost of missing to one side or the other of st able inflation as being especially skewed, given the current level of inflation.  That is, I wo uld not see 2 or 2½ percent core PCE inflation as a substantially worse outcome than 1 or ½ percent on core PCE inflation.  Of course, one’s evaluation of impli cations of the two possi bilities would depend cr itically on  how they came about—the role of demand an d productivity.  But, in general, I would have at least as much confidence in our ability to truncate rising PCE infl ation at 2 percent as in our ability to stop falling inflation at 1 percent. One risk I neglected that Gove rnor Gramlich highlighted last  meeting—and it has played an important role in our collective fr etting about the current account—is that of a substantial fall in the dollar that is much larger than assumed in the staff forecast.  Su rely, this is an  asymmetric and nontrivial risk that at some poin t could well put significant upward pressure on prices.  I’d be very cautious, however, about leaning on th e tighter side in anticipation of such a development.  First, the roller-coaster dollar action over th e intermeeting period was a nice illustration of the futility of trying to predict the timing and dimension of any foreign exchange mo vement.  Second, the appropriate policy response to a drop in the dollar will depend on the response of other asset 46 of 118   prices—the extent to which bond and stock prices al so react to the tapering-o ff in demand for dollar assets.  And third,  the dollar isn’t the only as set that risks a price correction, and some of the other candidates would call for a policy re sponse in an easing direction. Recent gains in house pricing have been astonishing.  Visiting banker s have told us that investment demand is playing an increasing role in this market, and while slower increases may be the most likely outcome, surely by th is point there is a much fatter ta il on the side of  a considerable softness or even decline in such prices.  In such a situ ation, saving rates might increase sharply.  I also find the recent behavior of bond yields  hard to understand.  While this  Committee has become increasingly confident of the vigor of the expans ion over recent months, long-term yields have actually declined, and most of this decrease is accounted for by th e decreases in real rates.  For a while, this movement seemed to  reflect the expectation that higher oil prices would sap demand and flatten the trajectory of our tightening, but the softness in yields has persisted over the last intermeeting period even as  oil prices and the dollar fell.  I do n’t believe this de cline represents expectations of central bank buying; it’s just too widespread across instruments.  A backup in bond rates in response to unexpected st rength in activity or prices w ould play an impor tant stabilizing role, but I see a nontrivial risk that something else will trigger a reassessment by markets and a noticeable upward movement in real ra tes that could damp the expansion. Finally, given these crosscurrents and uncerta inties, I remain convinced that our best approach to asset-price c oncerns is to react , possibly aggressively, to th e combination of asset-price movements as it occurs.  Such a strategy can be reas onably successful in count eracting the effects of even a large movement in asset pr ices, and it avoids making policy errors by acting in anticipation of asset-price changes that don’t occur or are quite delayed. 47 of 118   The net of all this is that I would remain on the measured path of policy tightening we’ve been following.  At the last meeting, I was concerned that we would soon need to prepare the demand and overall easing of fina ncial conditions over the interm eeting period, however, I no longer believe that such prepara tions need begin with the announce ment for this me eting.  But given my assessment of inflation risks, I also don’t think we should be planning on  moving up faster than the market anticipates, which does have us taking a break from time  to time.  How to signal this flexibility in the announcem ent remains a problem, bu t a problem for a future meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The incoming data  have provided sufficient reason for the staff to raise th e baseline forecast.  Real cons umer spending, excluding motor vehicles, has increased at a solid pace of late, and yesterday’s retail sales repo rt reinforces the notion that households are still ready to propel the econ omy forward.  On  the investment  side, housing sales and starts have also remain ed at elevated levels , and orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods have been trending upward.  Internat ionally, the dollar has fallen, and once we get past the usual J-curve effects, that should give so me impetus to the export sector.  And oil prices have moderated, reducing a potential drag on future growth.  Inflatio n expectations, as measured by the TIPS market for the five-to-ten- year range, are well contained.  Frankly, if that were the entire story, one could indeed settle in  for a long winter’s nap.   Unfortunately, in many ways that is not the entire story.  While th e data have been, on balance, better than many  had expected at our last meeting, th ere are some signs that we should not discount all the risks.  For much of this fall, I have been particul arly worried about both the pace of 48 of 118   technological change and the act ual amount of slack in the labor market, with the related implications for productivity  growth and inflationary pressures.  As Dave indicated in his opening remarks, the staff has captured this range of co ncerns in a scenario en titled “greater cost pass-through with lower structur al productivity.”  Giving  some credibility to the s cenario, I note, as Dave did, that the staff has marked dow n the forecast for grow th in real high-tech investment to only about its 1980-96 average.  This downshift in the forecast is reinforced by the current orders survey indicating that two major manufacturers of produc tivity-enhancing equipment characterized recent increases in orders as falling well below expecta tions.  At 30 percent, the percentage of NFIB survey respondents planning  to make capital expenditu res is near the low end of its ten-year range.  I’ve also heard from a private-sector contact of my own of a sudden weakness in demand for cutting-edge automated machine tool s.  This contact ha s an 80 percent mark et share for a key component that is used in ne arly all automated machine tool s, and he has experienced an unprecedented 30 percent cancellation for deliveries of  that critical part in Q1 of next year and is expecting softness throug h almost all of 2005.  Finally, I believe that th e slowing in Japan and emerging Asia, as I think Karen suggested, is indicative of the slowdown in the productivity-improving high-tech sector.  Just as we may be experienci ng a slowing in capi tal deepening, unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector experienced  a pickup in the most  recent four-quarter period, after having put in several su ccessive four-quarter declines.  Additiona lly, the data show quarter-over-quarter increases in unit labor costs of 1. 9 percent in Q2 of this year an d 2.2 percent in Q3, both at an annual rate. and a moderation in produc tivity growth.  Two deve lopments may be notewor thy in this regard.  49 of 118   First, for reasons that we do not fully understand, while longer-term inflation expectations are well contained, inflation compensation over the next five years has moved up noticeably since its low point in 2003.  Some of that is an unwinding of the di sinflation concerns of  2003.  However, the level of inflation compensation for th e next five years, at 2.6 percent, has already equaled or slightly exceeded its levels of 2000 and 1999, when  we were concerned about inflation risks.  Given the limited role of fore ign buying in the TIPS market compared with the nominal ma rket, the five-year TIPS is probably a relatively pure measure of dom estic expectations for in flation compensation.  The other interesting phen omenon for the markets is the flattening of the yield curve.  While the level of rates is also ge nerally lower than in the period between  1995 and 2000, as Dino indicated in the opening remarks, the two- to ten-year nominal spread has fallen from around 250 basis points to around 120 basis points now, whic h is the lowest level in three y ears.  The more steeply sloping earlier curve indicated bad times leading to good times.  Th e flattening of the slope recently might indicate okay times leading to okay  times, which is basically a cont inuation of growth at or around trend.  But the fact that the leve l of the rates is lower, as I th ink Don was implying, might indicate that the expected trend growth in the economy is also lower. Now, I put all this together to conclude that  the baseline forecast is a reasonable basis for policymaking today.  Incoming data and the change d forecast, as well as market expectations, all seem to suggest that we should continue to move policy from its current accommodative stance at the previously announced measured pace.  In addi tion, conditions are not so  dramatically different from the last meeting th at they warrant a major change in ou r statement.  Jane t Yellen, in her remarks, gave a very reasonable ex planation of why it is that produ ctivity growth might, in fact, increase, with a particular focu s on multifactor productivity and so me risk to inflation on the downside.  However, based on my  read, I also still put some we ight on the slowdown in capital 50 of 118   investment and capital deepening, which suggests that we should be vigilant to the risk of slower productivity growth, higher unit labor costs, and a higher pass-through.  The data and the market both seem to support that prudence.   Recognizing the uncertainty arou nd this general topic but also the importance that growth or a slowing of growth in productivi ty might play, I’m sure we will return to this discussion again in 2005 .  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bernanke. 

[SECTION]

MR. BERNANKE.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  Overall, the intermeeting data suggest a pickup in the pace of th e expansion in output and employmen t, with fewer downside risks to growth.  Inflation risks ha ve also moved slightly to  the upside, I think, but falling oil prices help to make any really significant increase in inflation unlikely.  I don’t think the shift in the outlook warrants a change in the balance of risks, at least not at this meeting, but for me these developments clinch the case for continuing  our policy of redu cing accommodation at a measured pace. I’d like to add a few comments on the current account and the dollar.  An important question for monetary policy is how long the current configuration—the la rge current account deficit and relatively slow adjustment of the dollar and real interest rates—can persist.  If this  configuration were the result of cyclical forces or other shor t-term factors like currenc y manipulation, then the expected half-life of the adjustment process might be short.  However, I think the U.S. external deficit is largely a secular phenome non which, consequently, is likely to evolve relatively slowly.  The key factor underlying the U. S. external deficit, in my vi ew, is excess global savings.  Advanced industrial nations with aging population s, notably Japan and Western Europe, need to save for demographic reason s.  Absent sufficient i nvestment opportunities at home, they can do this 51 of 118   only by running current account surpluses.  Ideally, the savings of these mature industrial economies would fund investment in developing and emerging-mark et economies.  However, in part because of the financial crises of the 1990s, emerging-market economi es are either unable or unwilling to accept large capital inflows, resulting in an econom ically perverse s ituation in which countries like Korea, Braz il, and Argentina have become significa nt exporters rather than importers of financial capital.  The United States is the recipient of massive savings inflows because, to a first approximation, global savings have nowhere else to  go.  As neither the demographic factors driving saving in mature industri al economies nor the inab ility of emerging markets to absorb large capital inflows is likely to ch ange soon, these inflows are likely to persist. Is the situation sustainable?  I think it can be sustained for some  years, though time does not permit me to seriously address that issue today.  It  is worth observing, however, that contrary to the perception that the U.S. current  account is being driv en by an unsustaina ble consumption binge, Americans are not consumin g beyond their means.  As a result of rising stock and house prices, over the past year U.S. net national wealth—that is, net both of fo reign borrowing and of governmental saving—has increased about $3.3 trillion, or around 30  percent of GDP.  That’s a number which, incidentally, goes  some way toward explaining the continuing strength of consumption spending.  If there is a causal relati onship between the current account deficit and U.S. consumption, it’s principally from the former to the latte r, as large savings inflows have lowered real rates and thus raised asse t values in the United States. I draw two somewhat contradictory conclusion s for monetary policy.  First, it’s quite possible—even likely—that a U.S. current account  adjustment will play out gradually over a number of years.  The staff’s as sumption of a slowly depreciating dollar is, therefore, the right one for our planning purposes.  We sh ould not attempt to forecast swings  in the dollar or base our policy 52 of 118   on a presumption that a rapid depreciation is likely in the near term.  Let’s see what the dollar does and then respond as necessary to fulfill ou r mandate.  However, while a slow unwind ing of the current account de ficit and relatively gradual adjustment of the dollar may be the most likely outcome, in a world of herding and momentum trading, financial accidents can ha ppen.  A panicky flight from the do llar, whether justified in some fundamental sense or not, would be very harmful.  Hence, my second, and I should emphasize, very tentative conclusion:  When facing a closely bala nced policy decision, we are probably better off erring slightly on the si de of tightness rather than on the si de of ease.  A higher rate makes short-term dollar assets more  attractive and raises the co st of shorting the currency , lowering the risk of a sudden depreciation.  All else bein g equal, a very slight bias towa rd a higher funds rate may thus provide a bit of insurance against a financial accide nt in the foreign exchan ge market.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  There has been much discussion lately of our measured pace.  Are we slavis hly raising the funds rate 25 poin ts per meeting or  following some other strategy?  Frankly, it is hard to think about this question withou t knowing where we are ultimately going.  Many seem to feel that our ultimate target is the e quilibrium funds rate, but whether we use a three-year or seve n-year horizon, or some  other construct, this  equilibrium is only a measure, not a policy goal.  We could raise rates to equilibrium, beyond it, or short of it.  The answer depends on economic consider ations.  So let me tr y to analyze our rate strategy in terms of these economic considera tions, focusing, just as Governor Bern anke did, on glob al economics over a slightly longer period than we usually consider. My goal is to rebalance the world economy, ultimate ly stabilizing U.S. international debt-to-GDP ratios while preserving pric e stability and at least proxim ate full employment around the 53 of 118   globe.  A more ambitious goal migh t be to let capital on net star t to flow away from the United States and more toward the emerging-market world, but such a goal is too ambitious even to think about now.  Governor Bernanke, I think, would say “unwise” even to think about no w.  For now, I just want to limit the infl ow ultimately to th e United States to a pace that  is likely to be sustainable in the long run.  A necessary part of this rebalancing is that the dollar has to fall enough to ultimately eliminate the U.S. trade deficit, the condition for stabilizing debt -to-GDP ratios.  I’m not talking about any of the preemptive  strategies discussed in the inte rnational finance memo.  I think the memo is right that these ar e unlikely to work.  I am talkin g about how monetary and fiscal policy should act to facili tate this rebalancing wh ile, as said above, pres erving price stability and proximate full employment.  It is harder than one would think to acco mplish this rebalancing because Americans seem to be ch ronic overspenders while the re st of the world seems to be chronically underspendin g, and I think this would be true  even apart from  demographics. The most straightforward part of  the plan involves Europe.  European ec onomies are already operating at less than full employment, and th eir employment problems only worsen if their currency rises.  They just have to stimulate thei r economies by some comb ination of monetary and fiscal policy.  If that involv es modifying the Stab ility and Growth Pact or the normal modus operandi of the ECB, so be it.  One would normally think that struct ural policies would be a neutral to a negative as demand stimulators, in line with that anecdote that  Karen told us th is morning, but it’s possible that European laws are so rigid that structural pol icies may boost demand as well. Asia is more complicated.  Fi rst off, the Asian economies should let the normal adjustment process work by permitting their curr encies to appreciate.  If they do n’t, they will ju st continue in this likely unsustainable situat ion with the ultimate adjustment  probably becoming even more costly.  If they do let the adjustment process work, Japan will definitely have to stimulate demand.  54 of 118   Not being aware of a way to set in terest rates below zero, this prob ably means fiscal stimulation, presumably a tax cut.  I realize that Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is  large and rising sharply, but that’s happening anyway.  It seem s to me that Japan shou ld let the equilibration pr ocess work a nd at least try to find some way other than by exports to stimulate domestic spending.  Other Asian economies should also let the ad justment proceed and stimulate thei r own domestic spending enough to preserve high employment. For the United States, the situ ation is complicated in a diff erent way.  My  own preferred approach would be to have fiscal tightening to  raise national saving an d perhaps even monetary accommodation to keep at full em ployment.  We should recognize that the fiscal tightening and lowering of interest rates would li kely add to the fall in the dollar.   In the press la tely there have been many statements implying that fiscal tigh tening is an alternative to a falling do llar.  In particular, Europeans seem to think that if we woul d only cut our deficits, the euro wouldn’t rise so much.  No way.  Fiscal tightening would normally st art or be part of a proc ess that leads to a falling dollar.  The two are complements much more  than substitutes. In the unfortunately likely case that fiscal tigh tening does not occur, there would have to be monetary tightening in the United States to offset the new export demand fr om the fallen dollar, as discussed by Dave earlier.  Such a response would fulfill the Fed’s mandate, but it would be less preferred, at least to me, from a national or world standpoint becau se it would not raise—and could lower—national saving.  With no  net capital inflows, this means lower domestic investment. To return to the central questi on, with this overall design, should we continue raising the funds rate, and how fast?  One outcome that would persuade me to sit still for a while, or maybe raise it at a gentle rate, would be the desirable pros pect of real fiscal tight ening in this country.  I haven’t been one of the Committee’ s doves in recent meetings, bu t if we had the real fiscal 55 of 118   tightening and higher national saving, I’d happily join the flock of doves and argue that the Fed should try to keep the economy at full employment by pausing or pe rhaps even lowering interest rates. On the other side, a much  less desirable outcome th at could also pe rsuade me to sit still is if Europe and Japan don’t come through with the desi red expansionary policy.  If neither stimulates their economy sufficiently or is able to stimul ate their economy sufficiently, world demand could easily be deficient, and there could be a world slowdown, possi bly even recession.  In such circumstances, the Fed also might well have to leave rates alone fo r a while.  But between these two extremes, there is a broad middle ground—not much fiscal tighte ning here and a world economy growing at moderate nonrecessionary rates—which is essentially the Greenbook forecast.  In such a case, U.S. demand will be  bolstered by the combina tion of a falling dollar and expansionary fiscal policy, and we should continue raising rates at a measured pa ce.  Hence, I am still  in favor of this strategy but willing to ch ange my position if I see, among other things, either  credible U.S. budget tightening on the good side or signs of a world slowdown on the bad side.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  There are two pers pectives that I’d like to add, one from the banking community and the other a follow-up on the fiscal issue.  If I were to compare the discussions I’ve had with bankers on what they  see in the economy to the comments that I’ve heard around the room, I’d say there is a notable di fference.  People around the room have described the economy in terms ra nging from “decidedly po sitive” on the upside to “reasonable” on the downside, whereas the bankers I’ve talked would come down more on  the side of “reasonable” than “decidedly positive.”  If there is a significant e xpansion taking place in the business sector, it’s happening outside the banking indus try in terms of their C&I lending .  C&I lending is growing, but 56 of 118   there’s a strong sense that it reflects a greater appe tite for risk-taking in the lending portfolio as opposed to an expansion of business. As others of you have suggested, a lot of the demand for business lending has come from the smaller entities.   Larger entities that have the option of either  expanding here or  offshore are as apt as not to expand offs hore.  The entities that do  not have th at option, of course, are expanding through borrowing at domestic bank s.  U.S. banks also have ta ken on more M& A lending—which more typically had been the purview of the cap ital markets—as a result  of the relatively low demand they’ve found for typical C&I loans.  There are a couple of exceptions to that.  Of course, the most notable exception is in co mmercial real estate.  And yet,  in condominium development in particular, several bankers have reported that the grow th in volume of new cond o starts is absolutely unsustainable.  Moreover, the end of the cycle is typically when you see co nversions of apartments, and that is rampant, particularly  in some markets—to the point wh ere there almost assuredly needs to be an adjustment  in the near future.  Al l that said, however, there still is nothing in that observation that would suggest that we should alter our pace of removing monetary policy accommodation.  We shou ld continue moving at the same pace  that we have been. With respect to Washington, D.C., and the willingness to take on some fiscal discipline, there are two points that would suggest a somewhat mo re positive outlook in that regard.  The first is the reaffirmation of John Snow as Treasury Secretary.  A presid ential election, es pecially the re-election of a President, is an op portunity for wholesale change, and indeed, that has occurred.  The fact that John Snow stayed  on even after he was hung out to dry for a while suggests that this White House did not seek the great at the expense of the good.  It also suggests th at there is an effort to move relatively quickly on the agenda that flows through the Department of  the Treasury, and that agenda certainly includes tax reform.  Governor Gramlich expressed concern at  the last meeting that 57 of 118   tax reform may be, in fa ct, explicitly tax re duction; that has not yet be en fully fles hed out, but nonetheless the team is in place to move forward.  The President is also disc ussing, at least in part, alternatives on Social Security, which suggests a greater  willingness to attack that one fundamental issue that really needs to be addressed. The second point that I think is positive has to do with the intellig ence reform legislation that was passed last week.  Now,  one wouldn’t ordinarily think that there would be a correlation between intelligence reform and fiscal responsibility.  However, the passage of  that legislation did send an important signal, and that is that a Republican House, a Re publican Senate, and a Republican White House are willing to work together.  Two weeks ago that wa s not clear.  The impediments to enacting that le gislation came from within the Re publican ranks, and many people in Washington see the fact  that the Congress move d very quickly to pass the bill as a suggestion that, indeed, the Republicans may wo rk as a team at taking directio n from the White House.  That, taken along with the fact that certain of the fi scal responsibility issues such as ta x reform, Social Security, and Medicare are c onsidered a priority, I think bodes well.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Gover nor Bies has laryng itis, as I’m sure you’re all aware, and Debbie Danker will read  her prepared statement. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES (as read by Ms. Danker).   The aspect of the economy that I want to focus on is the improving outlook for consumer  spending.  After a significant slowing in the second quarter, real consumer spending grew by a healthy 5.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter and advanced strongly in the last two months.  While early indi cators of holiday spending imply not as bright a time as retailers have anticipated, particularly for lower-price retailers, inventories appear to be closely managed.  The expectatio n for a strong year in  2005 for retail sale s seems more firmly grounded than earlier this fall.  Since the last FO MC meeting, oil prices have fallen significantly, 58 of 118   2 The materials used by Mr. Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).                                                   which should put more  discretionary spending power in the wa llets of consumers and help the cash flow of businesses th at are heavy users of petroleum products.   Over the past three months, payroll employmen t gains have exceeded their average pace of the past twelve mont hs.  The stronger pace of employment gains will expa nd the income base to support continued consum ption growth.  While consumers shou ld increase saving out of current income for their long-term financia l health, there are few signs that they are w illing to build their assets and defer spending at the current time.  Long-ter m interest rates are s till low by historical standards and have not provided enough incentive to  encourage significant growth in longer-term bank deposits.  Strongly rising housing prices ha ve increased assets, and the resumption in growth of equity prices in the stock market will provide another leg to support increased net worth.  If recent behavior patterns continue, therefore, consum ers will be able to increase spendi ng and show growth of assets, without significant increases in the short-term saving rate.  Thus, I have greater confidence in the pace of  economic growth in the next few qua rters, and I believe that we should continue to remove accommodation by raising the fed funds rate by 25 basis points today.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  I will call on Brian Madigan. 

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Financ ial markets were subject to a number of crosscurrents ove r the intermeeting period.  N onetheless, most financial in the top left-hand panel of exhibit 1,  line 1, yields on short-term Treasury coupon issues were up somewhat as investors conc luded that a pause in policy tightening was not imminent.  At the ten-year mark, howev er, yields on nominal Treasuries (line 3) and TIPS (line 5) declined modestly, apparently  reflecting in part i nvestors’ sense that growth in real activity was likely to be a bit less vigorous  than they had previously anticipated.  As noted, implied inflation expect ations for the next five years continued to edge higher, while those for the su cceeding five years were little changed.  Meanwhile, the Wilshire index (line 6) rose 2½ percent, while the Nasdaq (line 7) rose 4 percent, with equity prices supporte d particularly by falli ng oil prices.  Risk spreads on corporate, GSE, and emerging-market debt, not shown, declined virtually across the board. 59 of 118   As portrayed in the top right-hand panel, money market futures rates indicate that the expected path of monetary policy e dged up on balance for the next year but Treasury yield curve.  Futures quotes imply th at a ¼ point firming today is essentially built into market interest rates, and as indicated by the first bullet in the middle panel, a Desk survey taken last week similarly re veals that all twenty-two primary dealers expect a 25 basis point move today.  All of the dealers also think that you will retain the assessment that the risks to both sustainable growth and price stability are balanced and that you will keep the “m easured pace” language.  And the survey responses and conversations with the deal ers indicate that none expects you to use today’s announcement to signal a pa use in tightening going forward.    Still, market participants do not think you will tighten ¼ point at each meeting indefinitely into the new year.  As note d in the bottom panel, two of the primary dealers expect you to pause in Februar y—even absent a signal today—and seven anticipate that you will do so in March.  Fu tures quotes can be in terpreted as implying that you will most likely tighten 25 basis points in February, pause in March, and slow your pace to roughly a ¼ point move at  every other meeting over the rest of the year.  The quarterly average funds rates in the Blue Chip consensus released on built into futures rates, but that consensus still is consistent with your pausing twice before the fall.  The issue of whether and how soon to slow the pace of policy tightening was the theme of the Bluebook presented to the Committee for this meeting.  Alternative A was distinguished by a pause at this meeting.  Alternatives B and C both involved a ¼ point firming t oday, but only alternative B included language that would suggest a pause in the near term.  A case for continuing to firm policy by ra ising the target f unds rate another ¼ point at this meeting is summarized in the top panel of exhibit 2.  Most importantly, the expansion now seems to be well entrenched, with labor market conditions improving gradually.  The forces that had previously been restraining spending appear to have weakened cons iderably, and the Committee might thus believe that it can continue  to reduce the unusual degr ee of monetary accommodation put in place in the past seve ral years without jeopardizing satisfactory growth.  The Committee might also be concerned about a possible buildup of infl ationary pressures for several reasons.  For instance, members may feel that the st aff could be overly optimistic regarding trend productivity a nd worry that slowing productivity could begin to put upward pressure on unit labor costs.  Also, some anecdotal information suggests that increased business costs contin ue to put upward pre ssures on prices in some industries.  Moreover, actual infla tion has risen over the past year, and the recent inflation data have tended to come  in a bit above market expectations, potentially giving momentum to inflation expectations.  Inde ed, while long-term inflation expectations have been  essentially flat, the rise in actual inflation apparently has fed through to some degree into shor ter-term expectations .  Finally, ongoing downward pressures on the dollar seem to have augmented market concerns about 60 of 118   inflation.  All of these factors suggest the pos sibility of some upside risks to the staff inflation forecast.    The Committee may also interpret the staff’s revised estimates of equilibrium real interest rates as pointing toward continued monetary tightening over time.  The estimates of short-run r* presented in the middle panel suggest that equilibrium real rates have climbed sharply since early  2003 as the economy has strengthened.  Although your monetary policy actions have boost ed the actual real rate as well, that increase has lagged the advance in measures  of r*.  Consequen tly, the actual rate remains a bit below the 70 pe rcent confidence interval of  the model-based estimates (the darker blue band) an d noticeably below the estimate implicit in the Greenbook forecast (the dashed line).  These measures suggest that policy will need to be firmed substantially over time; but as emphasized in the Bluebook and the staff memos, the estimates of equilibrium real rates should not  be interpreted as prescriptions for the current stance of monetary pol icy.  Rather, these measures estimate the real funds rate that, if maintained over the next three year s, would close the output gap at the end of that time period.  Interpreted a bit more l oosely, the r* estimates attempt to measure the weighted average real rate  over the next several years consistent with closing the output gap at the end of that period and thus  do not have a direct implication for the setting of the f unds rate today.  Even assuming that such estimates are accu rate, bringing the real rate quickly to some estimate of r* would likely be undesirable for several reasons.  First, the Committee might be dissatisfied with the persistence of a positive output gap for another three years.  Second, the Committ ee might be concerned about the downward pressure on inflation that coul d result from that persisten ce.  And, third, for a variety of reasons the Committee may consider gradua l adjustment of the funds rate toward its ultimate equilibrium to be the preferred policy approach.  From that perspective, these r* estimates may be most useful in  providing a benchmark for thinking about the appropriate trajectory of policy over the next several years, for example, by considering the average amount of stimulus  that ought to be applied during that period as policy moves gradually toward a st ance thought likely to be consistent with medium-run equilibrium.  But even if you find these measures generally helpful in thinking about policy, as we obviously hope, you will still need to weigh a number of other factors in setting policy—for exam ple, how your outlook differs from those embedded in the models and the Greenbook, how quickly any output gap should be closed, where inflation is now relative to your preferred level, and where it would end up under a policy derived from considering these measures.  The question of the appropriate trajec tory of policy going forward is what motivated the staff to present alternatives B and C as distinct policy choices in this Bluebook.  As noted in the bottom left-hand panel, if the Committee believes that policy tightening can proceed at a slower p ace than it has over the past six months, it might wish to combine a ¼ point move at this meeting with a signal of a possible pause in the firming process before long.  Policymakers might think that the process of firming can now proceed at a slower pace for at least several reasons.  First, some 61 of 118   output gap apparently remains, and it does not appear to be cl osing particularly rapidly.  Second, the four rate hikes so fa r may be seen as having already reduced significantly the degr ee of policy accommodation.  That  would be the case if, for instance, members had a weaker outlook than the models and thought short-run r* was near the lower edge of the 70 percen t confidence band in the middle panel.  A relatively low r* could result from a conti nuation of the range of  factors that have apparently been restraining the expansion over the past few years—for example, the persistence of unusual business caution.  Such considerations might incline the Committee to shift to a somewhat slower pace of policy firming and signal such a shift today through the wording su ggested under alternative B.    However, policymakers may instead belie ve that the recent pace of tightening should be maintained, at least for a while longer, or even stepped up—and consequently that, as in alternative C, the Committee should not give any signal at this meeting of an imminent pause.  As noted in the right-ha nd panel, the existing degree of policy accommodation is substantial, at least as judged by the difference between the real funds rate and the range of point estimates indicated by the red band in the middle panel.  All economists agree th at monetary policy works with long lags, and members may be concerned that the considerable amount of monetary stimulus could be cumulating into an inflationary im petus that will become fully evident only with the passage of time.  Policymakers ma y see the recent inflation data, as well as the downward pressures on the dollar, as po ssibly the leading edge of a ramp-up in underlying inflation trends.  Finally, the s eemingly buoyant attitudes toward risk in financial markets may argue at the margin for a firmer path of policy.  Your last exhibit repeats table 1 from the Bluebook.  Should the Committee wish to suggest the possibility of  a pause at an upcoming meeting, as in alternative B, it could do so by indicating, as shown by the red text, that “the Committee’s policy actions since mid-2004 have resulted in a significant reduction in the degree of monetary policy accommodation” while noting that “nonetheless, the . . . stance of monetary policy remains somewhat acco mmodative.”  The economic description could be updated by referring to the “earlier” rise in energy prices and by indicating that labor market conditions “continue to improve gradually.”  Although market participants appear to anticipate some sl owing in the pace of policy firming in 2005, few if any expect you to signal a downshift today.  Hence, se lection of this alternative likely would lead investors to mark up the pr obability of a near-term pause.  Short- and intermediate-term interest rates would likely decline noticeably, stock prices could rise, and downward pressure  on the dollar could resume.  If the Committee, in contrast, believes that policy tightening should continue at the recent pace—and perhaps even wishes to allow for a poten tial acceleration in policy tightening—and hence does not wish to signal the possibility of a pause, only modest changes to the statement would appear  necessary, as in alternative C.  Choice of this alternative today likely would have minimal market impact.  Should the Committee harbor significant concerns about inflation, it could indicate that “the earlier rise in energy prices and an escala tion of business costs ha ve the potential to 62 of 118   contribute to upward pressure on prices.”  It could also state that “labor market conditions continue to improve ,” thereby hinting that cond itions on the real side of the economy are not likely to impede c ontinued policy tightening at upcoming meetings.  In closing, it might also be worth noting that the Committee would not necessarily have to signal a pause in advance thr ough its announcement.  First, the phrase “measured pace” presumably was intended, at  least originally, to allow for the possibility that policy might not be firm ed at each meeting— although some market participants have come to read it as implying regular policy moves.  Second, the market’s expectations for policy have not been completely immobilized by the existing language.  Market yields still fluctuate to some degree with incoming economic and financial information, given th e implicit conditionali ty in the language, and thus markets could come to anticip ate a pause—even wi thout a signal—should the data point fairly clearly toward the de sirability of a slower pace of tightening.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions for Brian? 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Just a clarification.  You have alternative C and then you actually have an alternative C ′, with alternative C focusing on energy prices as a growth issue—or at least having a potential impact on growth—and C ′ focusing on energy prices an d business costs as an inflation issue. 

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN.  Yes.  I wouldn’t focus solely on energy co sts, but that was the intent—to highlight that in particul ar as well as other elem ents of costs that are pu tting pressure on prices. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  What would sentence 3 look like unde r alternative C ′?  That wasn’t very clear. 

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN.  We’d simply say,  “Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace, but the earlier rise in energy prices and an acceleration of business costs have the potential to contribute to upward pressure on prices.” 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So you’d have “moderate pace” and “prices” juxtaposed there.  Then you’d have, “La bor market conditions continue to improve.”  

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN.  That’s correct. 63 of 118  

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions of Brian?  [Pause]  I actually have very little to add to what has been  said so far.  It is probably worthwhile reitera ting, to emphasize it, that the policy we have been engaged in is largely th e consequence of the fact  that we’ve had a very shallow recession and we have not had a recovery th at is typical of historical experience.  In the past, we’ve had rebounds that invo lved an ongoing process comparable  to other cyclical recoveries, so the forecasting of the recovery ha s been a lot easier than we have fo und it to be in recent months.  This time, without the typical re bound, we’ve been getting a set of endogenous forces that impacted with modest exogenous fo rces to produce not very  great changes in  the economy.  Indeed, if one goes back and looks at a Greenboo k from earlier this year , the economy doesn’t look all that much different from what we are seeing no w.  So not having a considerable  history to draw upon to make judgments about various potential outcomes—and one cannot readily project the underlying trends and assume that a partic ular outlook is going to materialize—we end up in a period where our forecasting is some what befogged.   We can put down a whole series  of numbers.  We can allow ou r econometric models just to run their equations and see what they tell us about the underlying  forces affecting the outlook.  But I suspect that we will find  the resulting forecasts no t very useful or accura te when looked at in retrospect.  That leads me  to the conclusion that we should continue our po licy of “opportunistic de-accommodation,” as I like to call it, so that we are moving toward a position where we will be better set to respond to what migh t happen to the economy either way.  It’s almost like the tennis player who has to move sharply to his right to hit a shot and tries to  go back to th e center of the court as quickly as possible to be in a position to  handle shots coming in an y direction.  If we can bring the funds rate up to a leve l that we feel confid ent is putting us in the center of the court—ready to respond to shots in any quadrant—I susp ect that we will find our selves in as good a 64 of 118   position as we are likely to  get.  I think we will find  that trying to fine-tune policy to the forecast is a very difficult game to play.  We can seduce ourselves into believing that the relative accuracy of the forecast is something we can  count on in the future.  Hi story suggests otherwise.  So, I think we probably would be best positioned if we implem ent alternative C—go with an increase of 25 basis points in the funds rate and make  only those changes in paragraph 3 that are essential to bring it up to  date.  Therefore, I would recommend alternative C with the statement as stipulated for that alternative.  President Hoenig.

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Could I interpose here ?  I would just note that we do have one slightly negative statistic—one that historically has always been exceptionally useful—and that is the initial claims for une mployment insurance.  Th ey’ve gone up in the last  couple of weeks.  We think it’s a Thanksgiving seasonal-adjustment probl em.  But in the past when data series have moved and we have tried to say “Well, it’s a statisti cal aberration of this fo rm or that form,” we have often found in retrospect that  it wasn’t.  So that’s  one minor cloud sittin g out there, which we ought to keep in mind.  I would hope, and I presume,  that it’s going to reve rse.  But that has not always been our  experience. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I don’t want to debate the da ta with you because you’re far better at analyzing them than I am.  [Laughter]  But I do take  some comfort in the av erage monthly growth in payroll employment over the entire year. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support your  recommendation.  I see an important difference between us and the tennis play er.  When the tennis play er runs back to the center of the court, the ball is already flying over the net.  His running to the center of the court doesn’t affect the way the game tu rns out.  [Laughter]  As we raise the funds rate and move back to center, so to speak, that move can affect how things will come out.  So I would not  run back to the center of the court just to run back to the center, nor would I go either way if I thought the game wasn’t going to turn out to be right.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I acknowledge your superior strategy.  [Laughter]   MR. KOHN.  I’m not in favor of ti ghtening so that we can ease at some po int in the future.  I’m in favor of tightening because it’s the right thing to do now. 67 of 118  

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I was referring mainly to the possi bility that we might look back in retrospect and find that real underlyin g inflation had been moving faster than we had expected.  I’m merely suggestin g to you that if our paradigm—which specifies that slowed productivity does not affect prices until it takes its full cut out of profit margins—is wrong and we end up with rising unit labor  costs and rising inflati on, we will be very please d that we did, in fact, move the rate structure up.  But I agree with you.  I don’t believe we want to  move the rate structure up in order to move it down.  That doesn’t strike me as a very plausible scenario.

It reads:  “T he Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustaina ble growth and pric e stability for the next few quarters to be roughly eq ual.  With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.3  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In th e not inconsiderable number of discussions of communications policies over the past few years, members have often brought the meeting minutes into the mi x.  For those in favor of expediting the release of the minutes, the benefits of such a change, as listed in the top left box of your first exhibit, include providing more timely and nuanced information about the economic outlook and monetary policy choice.  In particular, releasing the minutes well before the following meeting would he lp prevent situations in which market participants incorrectly interpret the la gged minutes as reflecting current Committee thinking.  The minutes convey the range of views within the Committee, and expediting their release could be seen as an advantage for a few reasons.  After their release, market participants will be able to put individual statements by policymakers into perspective according to the description in the minutes of the spectrum of members’ preferences.  In addition, policymakers might  be more willing to speak publicly about a wider range of policy possi bilities if they can point to a mention of those possibilities in the minutes, thereby improvi ng public communications.  In addition, if members thought the expedited minutes prov ided a sufficiently complete and timely explication of the policy decision, the polic y statement released  after the meeting could potentially be shortened.  Some members might not be convinced  by such arguments, perhaps for the reasons given in the box at the top right.  Expedited release co uld lead to undue that policymakers attached enhanced importance to them.  Moreover, members might be concerned that any resulting increased attention could complicate the Committee’s deliberations.  In particular, members might  conceivably alter th eir discussion at the meeting in order to be sure certain views we re represented in the minutes.  It is also conceivable that a member would offer s upport for a given policy decision only in return for agreement on a particular refere nce in the minutes.  If an adverse dynamic of increased market attention and increas ed contention within the Committee set in, the result might be that the minutes w ould become sanitized and increasingly unhelpful over time.  A last objection has been that it may be operationally difficult to manage expediting the minutes.  (In that regard, t hough, I note that, as described in the memo by Brian Doyle circulated last week, two central banks—the Bank of England and the Swedish Riksbank—have succeeded in releasi ng minutes about two weeks after their policy meetings.  To be sure, though, the pol icy committees of those institutions are smaller than the FOMC, and their membership s are not so geographically dispersed.)  To address concerns about operational difficulty, this January the Committee directed 70 of 118   its Secretariat to conduct an experiment in expediting the minutes.  As shown in the middle panel, for the typical FOMC cycl e, we posted a first draft for your consideration seven working days after the meeting.  Based on your feedback, we produced two more drafts over the next wee k, with the goal of gathering indications of your intention to approve the final draft in time to meet a hypothetical publication deadline of two o’cloc k on Friday afternoon.  In order to meet this schedule and to a ssess the experiment, as noted in the bottom panel, staff changed the process of producing the minutes in several ways.  We contracted with a private firm to produce transcripts quickly.  (This change also provides an important redundancy in our operations that was previously lacking.)  We distributed drafting responsi bilities among more staff so that work could be done along parallel streams.  And we’ve provided more systematic feedback on your comments in the final week to make it more  likely that the revision process comes to closure by the deadline.  To make it easier for a geographically dispersed membership to approve the minutes in a relatively shor t time frame, staff developed a procedure for secure, chad-free, voting.  Lastly, we collaborated with staff members in Public Affairs at the Board and the Markets Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to assess the likely market reaction ha d the minutes been released early.  This involved internally generating representative  headlines and wire-s ervice stories about the minutes consistent with the current environment and asking staff familiar with financial markets to hazard a guess as to the likely market response.  I take away four lessons, listed in exhib it 2, from this experience.  First, using more resources to produce and distribute the minutes soon after the meeting is helpful in ensuring that they are a true and accurate  record of your discussion.  In particular, memories are still fresh, and information a rriving after the meeting is less likely to shade the summary of the discussion.  Second, not all FOMC participants were familiar with all the rules governing the drafti ng of the minutes.  There’s been an oral tradition enforcing a hierarchy of “a few,” “several,” “many,” and “most” Committee members and defining whether speakers are desc ribed as “members” or not.  To make this process a bit more transparent, last week  I circulated a guide to the preparation of the minutes drafted by your Deputy Secret ary, Debbie Danker.  Third, the expedited schedule poses the risk that not all member s will be able to vote by the deadline.  Given complicated travel schedules and holid ays, on two of six occasions this year I was able to reach only eleven members by the time the minutes would have been released to the public.  That, however, does not strike me as a particularly serious problem given that the results of the notation vote would not be reported until the subsequent set of minutes.  As long as we have the approval of a majority of members, the minutes can be released on time, and we can note the subsequent concurrence or dissent with that decision by those who could not be reached in the following set of minutes.  A more serious risk is that the schedule may be too tight to achieve a consensus by the publication deadlin e, a risk that is elevated if some members have significant and contradictory comments on the first and second drafts.  My last observation is  that Friday afternoon is a terrible time to release the minutes.  On two occasions, the minutes would have been released on the same day as a 71 of 118   surprising employment report and probably would have added to the already significant market volatility.  In addition, financial markets tend to be thin on Friday afternoon, elevating the possibili ty of an outsized reaction.  This was a limited experiment, and in the bottom panel I’ve listed several aspects of a new regime that went untested.  In particular, the experiment was conducted over a period in which there were  no significant disagreemen ts among members about the direction of policy, perhaps l eading to a false sense of security about the ease with which a drafting consensus could be achieve d.  Nor has there been an intermeeting conference call this year, so we did not ha ve to work through procedures to handle that contingency.  Such a possibility does not seem to pose an insurmountable obstacle, though.  I would suggest that, as  a rule, the minutes relate information available from the close of the prior mee ting to the close of the current meeting.  Thus, the description of an  intermeeting conference call would be included in the minutes of the next regularly scheduled meeting.  If the Committee wanted to ensure the continued timely release of information, it could acknowledge a meeting held outside its regular schedule in th e subsequent policy announcement.  Because the experiment stopped short of actually releasing the statement early, it remains unclear how much increased scruti ny more-timely minutes will receive or how members will adjust their editing behavior .  It is also unclear how the public will react to the inclusion in the minutes of conditional statements, such as heightened interest in certain key data releases or the possibility of an intermeeting conference call.  That said, the minutes do not often include such conditional statements.  Moreover, when they do, they tend to expa nd on statements already made public in the Committee policy announcement, implying that the information content of such conditional statements in the minut es would seem to be limited.  On the last exhibit, I’ve listed three possibilities for today’s meeting.  As one possibility, the Committee could vote today to expedite the release of the minutes.  If so, I recommend beginning expedited release with the minutes of the February 2005 meeting and adopting a schedule of releasi ng the minutes of regular meetings three weeks after the day of the policy decision.  By beginning with the February meeting, the decision would be noted in the minut es of today’s meeting, which would be released soon after the February meeting a nd thus give the public advance notice of the new policy.  Adding a few days to the schedule by releasi ng the minutes after three weeks would give staff more time to  draft and participants more time to comment.  Such a schedule would also posit ion the release in the middle of the week, which would be less likely to cause difficultie s.  You might alternatively decide that the experiment has not been  conclusive enough and decide to extend it.  If so, I recommend shifting to a three-week schedul e because it seems more sustainable.  Lastly, you might not have liked what you saw in  the experiment or feel that the risks are too great to establish the precedent of early release.  If you do stop the experiment, I recommend continuing approximately the same production and internal distribution schedule so that  the minutes are prepared while the memory of the meeting is still fresh.  72 of 118   About one thing I am sure:  If you deci de to expedite the minutes, you will be setting a precedent that will make it hard to go back to lagged release if the results prove disappointing.  In su ch procedural matters, you have tended to go forward only if a preponderance of particip ants supports the change.  To  facilitate your discussion, I have asked President Poole and Governor Kohn to make the case, respectively, for maintaining the status quo and for expediting the minutes.  So I first turn to President Poole. 

[SECTION]

 MR. POOLE.  Thank yo u.  Let me start with  three preliminary comments.  First, I congratulate the staff on the way this experiment was conducted.   I think that we’ve learned a lot from it, and I think that the early drafting of th e minutes, in any event, will survive and should survive.  So I want to start with that observ ation.  Second, as noted, I do not favo r early release of the minutes.  But I do regard the issue as being fairly closely drawn.  I want to be clear that my opposition to early release is not ba sed on a slippery slope argument.  I don’t see that early release is going to lead to other de mands for information that would be harmful.  So I’ve decided this case on its own merits.  In my view, earl y release reinforces a favorable posture of openness but does not create substantive improvement in communication.  Also, early release has risks and could not be easily withdrawn if it is un successful.  Instead, the out come in that case, I believe, would be to make the minutes more vague and, therefor e, less useful th an they are now. Here is the structure of my ar gument.  Our aim in communications policy should be to move in the direction of perfecting th e rational expectations macroec onomic equilibrium.  The key to better communications for political accountability is continued polic y success.  Any change in communications policy that  may on the surface ap pear to enhance political  accountability but, in fact, interferes with policy succes s will not, in the end, serve th e purpose of enhanced political accountability.  In particular, misc ommunication with markets will damage rather than enhance political accountability.  The problem of improving  communication for th e purpose of improving monetary policy outcomes is reas onably well defined and will be the basi s of my argument. 73 of 118   Now, to move in the direc tion of perfecting the equilibri um, an importan t goal is to encourage market reaction to new information th at matches the FOMC’s reaction to the same information.  The issue is not primarily the market’s reaction to new information between one meeting and the next but, instead, to new information over a span of  quarters and even years.  We want the market and the Committee to assess moneta ry policy implications of  information the same way.  The flow of new informat ion is continuous .  The Committee meets at discrete intervals.  When the market reacts appropriately to new informat ion, the econom y has an impo rtant built-in stabilizer.  This goal is  quite different from conditioning th e market to expect a certain policy not come at the expense of enhancing the market understandin g of the fundamentals of monetary policy. Here are some principles that I believe should apply to the mi nutes.  First, it is extremely important that the minutes be faithful to the transcript.  Eventually, the two will be carefully compared.  Second, th e minutes should not themselves be a ma rket disturbance.  Markets may react, of course, to the minutes, but the reaction should be helpful and not harmful to the achievement of policy goals.  My concern is not undue attention to the minutes but misinterpretation of them.  The issue is not whether interest rates will respond to the mi nutes but whether the re sponse will be in the correct direction and amount.  If there is never a market response to the minutes, then we can conclude that the minutes are not providing useful information.   I’m convinced—and this is th e third principle—that there are times when the most constructive thing the FOMC can do is to remain quiet.  Minutes released before the next FOMC meeting will always be an event.   Minutes released on the curren t schedule are, at most, a minor event to the market.  I think we should be careful  about periods like the fa ll of 1998, when Long-74 of 118   term Capital Management was imploding.  For exam ple, the minutes of the meeting of August 18, 1998, contained this sentence:  “I n the view of one of these members, the trend in monetary growth along with indications of rising speculative imbala nces and excesses in vari ous markets for financial and nonfinancial assets called fo r a prompt firming of monetary policy.”  Would su ch a statement have been helpful in providing clear guidance to the market as to how th e Committee would likely respond to developments in the financial markets?   Would the statement ha ve been ignored as it represented the view of only one member?  I’m quite sure that the sentence would not have been helpful.  I don’t know whether it would have been ignored.  Su ppose the Committee were closely split in such circumstance s, and it was not just the view of on e member.  Disclosure of a close split would not be helpful.  Co uld the minutes be true to  the transcript without disclosing the split?  I think we all agree that we  can coalesce behind the majority view  on a Committee le d, of course, by the Chairman, but we do not want to  stifle discussion of competing vi ews around the table.  In short, it is not hard for me to imagin e circumstances in which the exp ectation of early release of the minutes would inhibit discussion.  I would feel more  comfortable about early release if the staff had reviewed the transcripts and minutes for the last  twenty years or so, lo oking for examples of discussions that might have been awkw ard under a policy of early release. Now, I’ve said that early release of the minutes will be  a market event.  Wh at I mean is that the minutes will be an event in the same way that the Chairman’s testimony is an event.  I believe that the focus of market attention will be on the im plications of the minutes for the policy action at the next FOMC meeting.  The current release schedule for the minutes has the advantage of focusing attention on th e Committee’s thinking and not on the probable po licy decision at the next meeting.  The advantage of rely ing on speeches and testimony—rath er than minutes  with a fixed release schedule and the constraint that minutes must be faithful to  the transcript—is that speeches 75 of 118   and testimony can be crafted to be more or less ex plicit, depending on circumstances, and they can be adjusted right up to the time of delivery.  Quite frankly, with early release of the minutes, I believe that in circumstances like the fall of 1998  the openness of discussions at the FOMC meeting and/or the nature of the minutes will be affected. My view on the nature of mark et attention to the minutes un der early release is that the financial press talks mostly to tr aders and traders care little about anything othe r than the very short run.  Traders want clues about th e Committee’s likely deci sion at the next meeting, and they really don’t care very much about the fundamentals of moneta ry policy.  Providing clues about our next meeting ought not to be our main intere st in communicating with the markets. I’ll finish with some unresolv ed issues.  We’ve already talk ed about what happens with minutes of meetings held between regularly scheduled meetings.  And incidentally, we might find ourselves with a problem of how we justify a dela yed release rather than a three-week publication schedule for those.  Could the Committee discuss the possibility of an  intermeeting policy action as it did at its meetings of  December 19, 2000, and March 20, 2001?  Those discussions were disclosed in the minutes of the me etings.  I think the Co mmittee could not  discuss the pos sibility of an intermeeting consultation unless th e special meeting was going to be held before the release date of the minutes.  To release minutes in which there is  a discussion of the po ssibility of a policy action before the next regular meeting would create market uncertainty that would not be constructive.   In sum, I do not believe that early release of the minutes will as sist measurably in communicating the fundamentals of  monetary policy, working toward further perfecting the rational expectations macroeconomic equilibrium.  I believe that early minutes will be read primarily for clues about the Committee’s pr obable action at its next meeting.  Finall y, I believe that  early release will at times be a market disturber, when th e Committee would be better off remaining quiet.  76 of 118   Moreover, I think it will inhibit the disc ussion of certain issues at re gular meetings.  However, let me restate my view that the issue on early release is closely drawn, and I’m not predicting disaster.  And I do believe that a Fed post ure of openness and transparency  is appropriate.  Thank you.

MR. KOHN.  I think we should speed up release of the minute s to about thre e weeks after the meeting, along the lines of the new schedule that Vincent suggeste d.  I agree that there are risks and potential costs, but I think they are partly within our ability to control and they are outweighed by the potential gains.  Potential gains come from  the more timely release of the additional information that Vincent re ferred to.  I do think that this information, by aligning the minutes better in time with the informat ion that we use fo r our decision, will help key market reactions to better match the FOMC’s re action to the same inform ation.  The minutes contain a more complete explanation of why we reached our  decision, including how we are looking at future  developments, than ever will be poss ible in an announcement.  They give  a much finer reading on what the Committee views as risks and skews in the outlook than can be convey ed by a one- or two-sentence balance of risk statement.  They  give a sense of alternative perspectives of Committee members, and this has been missing, for the most part, as the number of dissents ha s dwindled in recent years.   I think diverse views fu rther fill out the picture of the i ssues the Committee is focused on and where it sees the risks.  An earlier understanding of the Co mmittee’s rationale and range of views should help the public interp ret the economic situatio n as it develops over the latter half of the intermeeting period and more broadly to interpre t our reactions to incomi ng data.  The release would be another news ev ent—I entirely agree with Bill ther e—and markets may not always react in ways we find desirable.  This may prove un comfortable from time to time, but I’m convinced that, on average, ove r time market reactions to  the information in the minutes will reinforce our policy and help us achieve our objectives. 77 of 118   Earlier release of the minutes should prove useful for other aspects of our intermeeting communication.  I think it’s helpful to have a nother Committee document in  the public domain.  There are already a lot of interm eeting events in the speeches and interviews that  we do.  The minutes should assist markets to put our individu al speeches and interviews  in better perspective, making it less likely that  markets will make the mi stake of thinking that a ny of us, except for the Chairman, is speaking for the Committee.  I’ve found it useful  in speeches, a nd especially in answering questions in public, to reference the minutes or the announcement.  And having this document published earlier will give us more opport unity to utilize this method of putting our own remarks in the overall context and to reinforce the Comm ittee’s message.   I would not want to trade early release of the minutes for a shorter, less forward-looking announcement on the day of  the meeting.  I think there are useful things we can say about the future in that statement.  I count the experience of the la st five years—including the last year and a half or so of interest rate guidance—a s successes in that regard.  We’ve provided information that has helped the markets make accurate policy predictions, and in my view we have not constrained our ability to take needed po licy action.  Cutting ba ck on the announcement w ould leave a three-week void in which markets would have less guidance fr om us, but I recognize th at we’ve had a difficult time deciding on what an d how much to say in that  statement.  There is no  consensus on which way to go next in this regard, and announcements have evol ved, and are likely to continue to evolve, slowly.  All these tendencie s argue that the value of the minutes to supplement the announcement is likely to increase over time. The main negatives, as Bill st ressed, are the potential feedback on the minutes and even more seriously on the de liberations of the Committe e.  We cannot adopt a new transparency tool that would in any way make the Committee discussion less useful an d productive.  I do think the 78 of 118   experiment, together with the ex tra time embedded in Vincent’s proposal, should take care of the concerns about whether the Comm ittee could converge on an ag reed-upon documen t in the time allotted.  And Vincent has explained how inte rmeeting conference calls would be handled. With regard to the feedback on the minutes or discussion, I th ink we should remember that these are minutes, not transcripts.  Artful word ing can make them comprehensive and truthful records of what we discu ss and of the reasons for our decisions, without in cluding information that would endanger financial stability.   We should continue to err on the side of comprehensive coverage.  We should no t cut the minutes back.  My experi ence as Secretary was that, on those occasions when I debated how much to includ e of a particular discussi on, the Committee benefited over time from a fuller, more comprehensive set of  minutes, even at the ri sk of some near-term discomfort, because the ab ility to reference the minutes in late r testimonies and public discussions was so useful. In our last discussion, some of us expressed concern that ex pedited minutes would constrain conditional or contingent deliberati ons for fear of how they would be  reflected in th e minutes.  I read the policy paragraphs in the minutes for the last two years—not the last twenty years, I confess, Bill.  But in the last few years, the paragraphs relating to our polic y discussions contain few, if any, contingent statements that aren’t  foreshadowed by the announcement.  In fact, in thinking about your examples of December 2000 and March 2001, in both of thos e cases the announcement said that we would be monitoring developments carefu lly.  So I think the anno uncement foreshadowed what the minutes said about the possibility of an intermeeting move. In terms of conditio nality, I couldn’t find anyt hing in looking at the minutes of the last few years that I felt would have done the Committee harm  if it had been released earlier.  Now, I didn’t look back twenty years.  Conditio nality in the minutes is usually im plicit, not explic it.  Discussion 79 of 118   does give the readers a better sense of the variables that are informing the Committee’s decisions at that moment, and they don’t typica lly say “if x occurs, th en we will do y.”  Moreover, as I noted a few seconds ago, there are always ways of covering discussion s without contributin g to instability; I think we do that already.  As a consequence, earlier release of the minutes should not deter the Committee from a free discussi on of alternative outcomes and their pol icy implications. Finally, this is under our contro l.  We will be settin g the precedents over  the next couple of years that will guide future Committees.  I think we can discipline ourselves to maximize the gains and minimize the potential costs of this exercise.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Th e floor is now open for discussion. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  I’ll speak first, partially because I’ve spent five  years working with Vincent on getting us to this happ y place, and I don’t share his sighi ng about it.  I think expediting the release of the minutes is a useful step for the Committee to take.  My  views on this, I must admit, have changed.  The last time we discussed this, I was oppos ed to early release.  This time—though I agree with Bill th at it is a very close call—I have move d slightly to the point that I think it is, on balance, a good thing to do. The benefits are ones that I think Don has pointed out.  The minutes will be more contemporaneous in time with the relevant meeting.  They are a more subtle, nuanced, varied representation of what transpired at the meetin g than we can possibly provide in a one-page statement.  They also have the benefit of givi ng us a touchstone on which to review other commentary; they may actually in some sense dr own out some commentary and highlight others.  I agree there will be costs.  I’ve worried a great deal—and I continue to  worry—about the high attention that is likely to be pa id to these minutes, par ticularly since I think of  them prim arily as a reflection of historical relevance not necessarily a predictor of the future.  But they do talk about 80 of 118   what has happened.  I also  worry about a point that Bill made very clearly, which is the risk that these minutes, since they will be an “event” where the Committee is in volved in the markets between meetings, would drown out other news  when in fact—in terms of future policy deliberations—that news might be more important than anything that was in the minutes.  There are some costs that I think we can manage without much difficulty.  For example, on the question of whether or not the minutes gradually will beco me smooth and polished an d not be an accurate reflection of what transpired at the meeting, I think we and the sta ff can manage that.   So given the close call, why did I move from thinking this wasn ’t a good idea to thinking it is, on balance, a reasonable  idea?  The answer ultimate ly is just the reality of life.  We already are in the markets between meetings.  Currently we have to be in the markets be tween meetings with an old set of minutes as opposed to a more relevant set of minutes.  Unfortun ately, in spite of our efforts to educate the markets that this document is historical and does not relate to what has happened in the past six, seven,  or eight weeks, they still react—perhaps more than they should, though sometimes appropriately—to the information that’s in the mi nutes.  And they get it wrong, I think, about as often as  they get it right.  So recognizing that we are in a position—contrary  perhaps to the position I’d like to be in—where we’re interacting as a Co mmittee both on the day of the me eting and then whenever the minutes are released, on balance I think it makes sense to have  those minut es be a little more contemporaneous and a little fresher, as opposed to be ing very much out of t une.  I say that because in either case the markets treat them, sometimes appropriately and at other times inappropriately, as a reflection of the Committee’s view s.  So my views on this issue have changed; I’ve moved to preferring, on balance, to release the minutes earli er.  And I think this experiment has been very, very useful in that regard. 81 of 118

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN.  Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  I’ve felt for a long time that the minutes, given the way we currently handle th e timing of their release, are an unappreciated or at least underappreciated asset.  So I co ntinue to strongly favor moving up the release date.  I think Don basically made the case, so let me just quickly summariz e things as I see them.   In my experience, the minutes are accurate, they  are comprehensive, and they are valuable.  They illustrate the thinking of th e Committee, and they ge t into the issues that  we discuss when we consider policy.  I think all of that is important to communicate to the public.  In short, I believe it would improve communication to re lease the minutes earlier, when people would have  an incentive to take a real interest in them.  And that , to me, is the reason for doing it.   I agree that there are some potential downsides, and I don’t want  to overstate or exaggerate the benefits.  But I do believe that , on balance, the benefits are rath er compelling.  I also think that it’s certainly possible from time to time that market participants wi ll read something in the minutes that we believe is innocuous and ma ke a lot more of it th an we would.  But in my view we shouldn’t be so paternalistic and worry that , if market participants don’t ge t it right every time, something has gone seriously wrong.  Mo st market participants are smart, sophisticated people, and I think, on balance, they will get it right most of the time; and when they don’t, that’s their business. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bernanke. MR. BERNANKE.  I support the e xpedited release of the minutes.  I think we should point out that on a number of occasions this year the delayed release of the minutes has actually confused the market—stepped on our message  from the most recent meeting by  sending a somewhat different signal.  And although I don’t have a lot of market contacts, a number of them did contact me at those times and asked, “What’s going on here?”  Second, I would put more weight on the notion 82 of 118   that we all have to go out and give speeches and talks and answer ques tions and we worry about giving the wrong si gnal and confusing the market.  It would be a comfort to have a Committee document out there to whic h we can refer and which the market can use for putting our remarks in perspective.  That will reduce th e risk that we all face of inad vertently moving the market or creating a misimpression.  And finally, I would just  note, as Vincent’s stud y showed, that a number of other central banks have used this practice effe ctively and have not had se rious problems with it.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I support early rel ease.  We don’t have  to do this, but I think it’s the sensible thin g to do, and I think it’s th e sensible time to do it.  I can’t improve on the arguments made in favor of it by Don, Gary, and Ben.  I would say,  Bill, that the argument you led off with is sort of an argument  for extending the delay and taking release of the mi nutes out of the time frame when they woul d be viewed as having any signal valu e for the future st ance of monetary policy.  You weren’t advocating that, but I think it’s awkward to suggest that we should release the minutes outside the time period of the meeting to wh ich they relate.  In my view it’s bett er to take the risk of some noise added to the signal by rele asing the minutes between meetings, closer to the relevant meeting, than to have the risk that the release comes after a new po licy decision has been made and thus creates broad confusion about how to interpret the minutes in th at context.  Generally I think early release will add mo re perspective to our views about the outlook fo r inflation and output growth and will pr ovide more context to  the range of views across the Co mmittee.  Therefore, I believe it will give people a better sens e of the factors shaping ou r decision, and in that sense, I think it would be helpful.

 MR. HOENIG.  I support early re lease of the minutes, Mr. Chairm an.  I have for some time.  I think it will give a be tter sense of the Committee’s views an d the process of its thinking with regard to policy, and I believe th at will serve th e market well. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I think the experime nt to date has been a very good one.  It has produced a much higher qua lity initial product becaus e it’s written closer to th e time of the meeting.  Personally, I have had no problem  keeping with the tig ht schedule, despite a couple of late comments on my part, and I want to congratulate the st aff on the work they’ve done to make the process more efficient.  I think we really have —no matter what we do wi th it—a higher quality product for both the transcript and the minutes as a result.  So I would continue doing what we’re doing, no matter what de cision comes out of this discussion today. On the issue of early release, I think we’ve been conducting this  experiment in the best of times, as President Poole mentioned.  Our statemen t has provided what the market has seen as near-term assurance; absent really off- the-chart data, market participants have some sense that policy will continue in a particular direction.  So, in that regard, releasing th e minutes early in this environment probably wouldn’t have had a whol e lot of effect.  They would ge nerally have confirmed what the Now, I’d always looked at rele asing the minutes early as kind  of a quid pro quo for taking out of the statement the wording that we’ve had in there for the best part of the last year or so orienting the market toward the gradual nature of ou r doing what we’re going to  do.  As I think back over my years on the Committee, wh en we started to me ntion the tilt and then  the measured pace and gradual nature of removing po licy accommodation,  it was basically to give the markets a sense of some conditioning around our actions. 84 of 118   I have felt that, if  we release the minutes ea rly, the markets will ge t their conditioning from the minutes; they wouldn’t need it in the statement released after the meeting.  We wouldn’t have to try to figure out all the delicate word ing that’s a shorthand way of tryi ng to tell the market more than we need to tell them.  I think the r ecent past has been a period of ti me when we’ve need ed to tell the great.  The future direction of policy won’t be so clear to us.  And the market , in fact, ought to be arriving at its own thoughts about the direction of policy and taking out insurance in case it is wrong rather than looking to particular statements of ou rs for the reasons to go in a certain direction.  So I view the two communications as a package.   I thought we’d take  a lot of the forward-looking commentary out of the statement—the “measured pace ” language, certainly—in return for releasing the minutes earlier.  That could have some good effects; Don has gone into them.  It could have some bad effects.  There co uld be a timing issue where we en d up releasing the minutes when something else is going on  and we’d have two additi onal points of noise.  But I thought of this as a package.  So I’m fi nding it hard to think about  releasing the minutes with the continuation of the “measured pace” language in the st atement.  I’d rather change the two things at the same time.  In that regard, if it’s going to take us a while to decide how to change  the statement, I would continue the experiment on the minutes and keep asking ourselves the question that President Poole mentioned, both for now and in the past:  Are there r easons that expediting the release of the minutes has more of a downside risk  than we now appreciate?  So I’d be in fa vor of the middle road here.  I recognize that it’s a difficult decision to make, and I wouldn’t make it now.  I’d make it when we’re ready to change the statement, which I hope we’ll be ab le to do sooner rath er than later.  And in the interim, I’d continue the experiment. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. 85 of 118  

[SECTION]

 MR. GRAMLICH.  I woul d support early release.  I woul d do it unequivocally.  Unlike Cathy, I don’t view this as something under the conservation of law and information here.  So if we give out more information sooner, I don’t think we have to take anything back .  In particular, I think the statements are working very we ll now, and I wouldn’t change those in the least.  I just plain support early release.   Let me make three other quick points.  Bill ment ioned that, if we didn’t have early release of the minutes, we’d still have a number of speeches as a comm unication tool.  Well, member speeches are member speeches; th ey are not statements from the whole Committee.  I don’t think the two are equivalent, and I’d rather have some thing from the whole Comm ittee.  On the question of whether the market would misinterpret the data , I can’t see how bringing  the minutes closer to when the data came out wo uld increase misinterpretation.  This is a point Don made.  I think it would reduce misinterpretation.  An d, third, I’d like to support a point that Be n made, which is that, when the minutes come out  after we’ve given the statement for the next meeting, there’s inevitably confusion about that.  It has happened several time s, and with early releas e of the minutes we get away from that.  So, to me , it’s becoming clearer and clearer that we ought to go to early release and that we shouldn’t do anything to our statement. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN.  Mr. Chairman, like Roger, I was in th e group originally  that was very uneasy about this.  But I’ve come to  the other side and believe that, on balance, it is probably the thing to do.  Let me mention just a couple of thoughts, with out completely repeating what others have said.  I would al so commend Vincent and the staff and Bill and Don for he lping us understand some of the issues involv ed.  I was thinking that mo re and more over the last  few years—starting with 86 of 118   Dave and his staff and our own staff—we have used the concept of error bands around our forecasts.  And it seems to me that  there are, in fact, distinct opinion bands around our views in a meeting.  I’ve been among those who have been very uncomfortable  trying to boil down our post-meeting statement to a few phrases.  I sh are some of Cathy’s feeling th at, if we’re going to release the minutes earlier, we mi ght like to have a tradeo ff at some point and that  might be the way to accomplish it.  I agree completely with the point that Ben, R oger, and Tim all made about the fact that we’re making speeches anyway  and the market is analyzing what we say.  I’ve found myself over and over again a week or two after a meeting, when it’ s time to go back out and hit the street again, wishing that the minutes were  in play so that they could pr ovide a frame of reference for my comments.  I think it’s a distinct advantage to have the minu tes in the public domain earlier. Finally, I’d note a couple of nuances that perhaps could go unsa id.  One of th em I say with some trepidation.  In the original discussion, I raised so me concern about not knowing what happens after all the comments come in or how they get resolved.  Vincent has done a nice job of telling me what he di d in terms of the disposition of my comments.  But I have no concept of what other comments came in and what kind of process he went through behind the scenes to take them into account.  I don’t mean that as  a lack of confidence in either Vincent or you, Mr. Chairman, to tailor the final minutes appropriate ly.  They’ve turned out pretty well.  Bu t there may be other Secretariats or other Chairmen that I’d be a little uncomfortable just turning loos e and giving a blank check.  In the last discussion  of this you suggested that it might be possible to have a small editing committee so that somebody would know what kind of  comments were coming in and how they were handled.  So that issue of how differenc es are resolved when va rious comments  come in still makes me a little uneasy. 87 of 118   Let me make one final comment.  If we’re not going to release the minutes early but continue to produce them early, I wonder if we don ’t leave ourselves a little vulnerable to criticism if somebody outside finds ou t that we have, in fact, produced them but have put them on a shelf.  If the minutes are in final form and people find out about that, I think we’re r eally vulnerable to somebody saying, “Why didn’t you release them?”  So I don’t kn ow whether that halfway house works or not.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Mr. Chairman, I think that the experiment wa s very helpful.  My own feeling is that releasing the minute s early will provide useful inform ation to the mark ets.  I think it will help us commun icate better.  I agree, as others have said, that it will be very helpful in our speeches and interviews.  And other central banks are doing it.  Also, strictly from the standpoint of logic, we are producing minutes, and we are going to release them at some  point.  We now know that we have the technical ability to release them ear lier than we have been.  It’s rather difficult to argue that we should delay releasing them be cause we think people are going to misuse the information.  That just doesn’t hang together from  a logical standpoint.  I don’t know that we could pass the “red face” test in making that argument in public. I agree with Cathy in that I would also very much like to take out the forward-looking statements in our announcements.  But as for the idea of packaging these two changes together, I think it would be very difficult to accomplish just in terms of trying to get agreement among the Committee.  It’s difficult enough  to get agreement on one piece of this let alone two pieces at the same time.  So I just don’t know if it’s practical to tr y to do that.  If we decide  to go this route, I do have one minor suggestion on the an nouncement.  But why don’t I hold  off on that until we decide whether we’re going to  do this or not. 88 of 118

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  I strongly support expedited rel ease for a lot of the re asons that Governor Kohn and others have expressed.  I have a general predilection to ward more transp arency; the more information in the markets, the better.  I just want to make three points.  On e is that bringing this information out earlier in time would resolve uncert ainty earlier.  If we see any market reaction to this, for the most part it  would just represent a sh ift in the timing of market  volatility.  It doesn’t seem to me likely that on net, in any global sense, it’s  going to add any market vola tility.  So we shouldn’t let the magnitude  of perceived market reactions dissua de us or give us  second thoughts down the road.  The second point I want to make is that I do see this as  alleviating some of the pressure on the Committe e with regard to the drafti ng of the statement.   But, Cathy, I think this cuts both ways.  After expedited release of the minut es, the statement will stand as the Committee’s latest communication for only th ree weeks.  To some extent, that could make it easier to communicate and agree on phrasing rather than harder, since only three weeks are at stake rather than an entire intermeetin g period.  I agree with Don.  I wouldn’t want to  see the extent of the communication we do in the statem ent cut down.  Finally, there’s one tiny detail that I hesitate to bring up, but it sort of surprised me .  If it were up to me , I’d like to see it chan ged.  Apparently, it’s the tradition that n onmembers’ policy statem ents are excluded from the minutes as they’re written.  Now, I don’t remember ever notic ing this before, and I can’t reme mber seeing it in the orientation package I got.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is that true? MR. REINHART.  In the last several paragrap hs, which bear only on  the policy decision, a statement refers only to comments made by members.   Before that, in the di scussion of the outlook, the minutes reflect the entire go-around, so it includes all particip ants at the table. 89 of 118  

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think that’s th e logically necessary position for this Committee to take. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  Which one? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The one ju st enunciated by Vincent. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  In the material Debbie circulated last  week, the propos al was to make the distinction sharper by talking about members and other participants in the earlier section.  But, again, when it comes to wh o voted on the policy deci sion, it’s only  members. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Suppos e we had a situation in wh ich the nonmembers held different views from those who voted but then we  show a unanimous vote.  We’d get a lot of comments as to why the indicated vote was wrong.  We can’t do it that way.   The voting members have one privilege and one privilege only:  They get to vote on the policy at that particular point and on the nature of the statement.  The discussion of what is going on in the econom y and the issues that are on the table and the re levance for potential future polic y changes is a full Committee discussion.  But the specific policy decision that is  reported is the vote of the then-Committee.  And the membership of the Committee changes from time to time. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman, let me just say a couple of thi ngs.  First, there is this mechanism for distinguishing between members a nd nonmembers.  So a view about policy could easily be attributed to a nonmember.  Second, ma ny statements about the economy by members as well as by other participants se em integrally linked wi th their statements about policy.  Today’s meeting, I think, was an excellent example of that.  Third, I view the purp ose of the minutes as a means to communicate to th e public the deliberations that occurre d at the meeting, rather than the deliberations of the Committee— 90 of 118  

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No, that is not the purpose.  The purp ose is essentially to give the reasons why we vot ed the way we did. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  Well, that’s a diff erent philosophy; I’ll grant that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It  has always been that way.  The point is that, if you divide the Committee into two separate groups and then discuss what those who voted on  the particular statement thought and what those who didn’t vote thought, we are actually no longer talking about the Federal Open Market  Committee.  The Federal Open Market Committe e is composed of the twelve members who have the right to vote at a pa rticular time.  That’s the law.  We can’t get around it.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Vincent, in the discussion in the minutes that refers to the first part of the meeting on the outlook, where you use the terms “m ost,” “many,” and “several,” is the denominator— 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  It  is nineteen. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Could I just say something?  We are really discussing two things here.  One is the issue of members ve rsus nonmembers—I would use the terms voting members and other members, but be that as it may—an d whether you discuss all of their pe rspectives in the last part of the minutes on the policy discussion.  Then there’s the other question, which relates to the change that Vincent and Debbie proposed, about whether to  call certain people “other participants” in the first part of the discussion.  I think that’s pushing it a bit.  I don’ t mind, if I’m not a voting member, not having my views included in the comments on policy.  That doesn’t bother me.  But to draw a distinction between members and other participants in— 91 of 118  

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, you don’t have to do that.  The basic statement is that in that last section of th e minutes we are merely st ipulating “the reasons for the policy decision.”  In that context, only the views of those who actually voted on the po licy are included, and we don’t make reference to anybody else. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That’s exactly what  I am suggesting to you to do. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That ’s indeed what we do. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  In tryi ng to actually write  down what was the oral tradition, we did find that not everybody agreed on what  it was.  One thing was clear:  As the Chairm an said, the last two paragraphs essentially are viewed as explaining the vote of the Committee.  Hence, in those paragraphs, the “members” we talk ab out are the members of the Committee. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Right.   

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  The problem is  if you want to represen t everyone’s views in the discussion of the economy several paragraphs earl ier and you refer to them  as “members.”  Then you’ve used the same word to descri be two different sets of people. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Are you using “membe rs” in that different way now? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Yes.  Unfortunately, it tu rned out that the rule was that anyo ne in the discussion was called a member up to the last co uple of paragraphs, and then only members were called members in the last couple of paragraphs.  That seem ed to be an unsupportable inconsistency.  We didn’t want to exclude nonm embers’ characterizations of the economy and the risks to the outlook, and one way to do that woul d be to call them  “participants.” 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Can’t you call the group in the last few paragraphs voting members? MS. MINEHAN.  Yes, right.  Wh y not call them voting member s as opposed to members? 92 of 118  

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The definition of the Federal Open Market Committee is statutory, and there is no such thing as a nonvo ting member of the Federal Open Market Committee. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I was ra pped on the knuckles by Joe Co yne fifteen years ago on exactly that point.  The membership of the Committee is twelve people, and there is no such thing as a nonvoting member. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Why not call everyone pa rticipants in the fi rst part of the—? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  We’re quite happy to do that, yes. 

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  That’s what he’s proposing. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  That ’s the proposal. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That works. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  So up to para graph 21, or whatever para graph number it is, if you express a view you’re a participant in the meeting.  If you express a view that is included in the last couple of paragraphs of the minutes,  it’s there because you are a member. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  You’re a member, right.  Okay. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Ok ay.  President Yellen. 

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Well, just briefly, I’d say that I definitely su pport the publication of the minutes on an expedited schedule, given that it is  feasible.  And I agree completely with Don’s analysis of the benefits.  It does seem to me  that, in moving toward  perfecting a rational expectations kind of equilibrium,  the minutes released in a timely fashion, when they’re still relevant, contain enough informa tion about the Co mmittee’s reaction to data  and how it processes those data that it should help the market improve its understanding of  the rationale for policy.  And that includes the fact that there isn’t unanimity on th e Committee; there is a range of opinions about the outlook and the risks.  Just in the brief time  that I’ve been back on the Committee, there have 93 of 118   been occasions when the minutes were released at  a point when they were  actually misleading because the views of the Co mmittee had changed.  I’v e found that unfortunate. Let me respond to Cathy’s point.   While I can understand that , if the Commit tee decides to move back to more formulaic lang uage in the statement and to omit any reference to a consensus about future policy, some might view earlier release of the minutes as a subs titute for those kinds of statements.  But I would consider that both unnecessary and unf ortunate.  I suppor t Ned’s comments about that, in that I think it’s actually quite helpful to have an explicit stat ement about the Committee’s consensus view regard ing future policy.  So I would not like to see this become a simultaneous decision to forgo that in favor of the earlie r release of the minutes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON.  I have two comments .  First of all, I see the deci sion as, on average, a four-week acceleration of the release of the minutes, an d therefore I think there are two considerations.  One is, Is there a logistical problem with early release?  Having had Vi ncent track me down when I’ve been away from the office at times, I realize that there is a burden in meeting the publication deadline.  But from what  I’m hearing, that is no t an insurmountable probl em.  The second is, Will there be any significant changes in  the minutes as a resu lt of that acceleration?   We won’t really know the answer to that until we get into it, and I thin k I’d support Don’s eval uation that it probably is a manageable issue.   Also, of course, the first time that we  release the minutes ea rly it will be an early release.  From ther e on, it will be a schedule d release. So I think we will get the early release only once.  [Laughter]   Finally, I don’t see this decision  and the language in the statem ent as a package.  I think on balance the market would tend to  see a less forward-looking stat ement as a net reduction in our communication, and I think we would have to reverse that policy.  That gets back to a point that Bill 94 of 118   made earlier, which is that we can’t retreat.  I’m an incrementalist because we can never go back.  I think our communica tion policies will continue to  evolve.  There is no end game.  There is no destination.  We ought to make this move but do it in  complete isolation and not have any other corresponding move s along wi th it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO.  Like President Minehan, I thought the experiment on early release of the minutes was motivated by the strugg le that we were having in capturing the full sense of the Committee in the few words that ar e allowed in the press statement.  I also have been uncomfortable with the code words that we’ve been using in th at press statement.  An d those code words have proven awkward to remove without sending unintended signals to the markets.  So I still prefer a shorter post-meeting statement with the early release of the minutes.  I also agree with President Mi nehan—especially after reading Vincent’s list of untested aspects of the experiment—that we’ve been conducting it  in the best of times.  That led me to come to this meeting in favor of what  Cathy referred to as the middle- of-the-road ground.  Let’s extend the experiment through circumstances that might not be considered the best of times.  I know that this is an unpopular position, but  I thought we were go ing to continue to pe rfect our communication strategy and that this would all be one package.  I can see, howeve r, in listening to  my colleagues, that I’m in a minority in that view.  Neverthele ss, I did want to take a more middle-of-the-road approach and continue to improve our communications. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  When I proposed the experiment on early release of the minutes, I thought that we were addressing a few questions.  The first one was, Can we do it?  Do we need to change the process?   Can we all focus our attention on the minutes, given the time constraints?  And 95 of 118   given the new proposed process, were we comforta ble with what would be released?  I think that was the experiment.  I think we learned a lot from that experiment, but not everything.  We learned, for example, that we shou ldn’t move to releas ing the minutes on a Friday.  We also decided that we ought to plan to publish the minutes three weeks after the meeting.  Quite frankl y, I think that’s a good addition of a few extra days to  allow for contingencie s.  I believe we woul d have had a harder time meeting the publication goal ex post if we had started releas ing the minutes on  the previous Friday. But one never learns everything from an experiment .  So if there are thin gs left on the table, it shouldn’t surprise us.  Nevertheless, we now have  a new process for produc ing the minutes that is more timely.  It brings more resources to the work , has hastened attention to it, and actually is a discussion that’s more sy mptomatic of the ti me when the minutes would be  released.  I, therefore, endorse the release of the minutes in a more timely fashion.  I know there’s some concern about several weeks later, it’s just a matter of time before someone says, “Why are you doing that?”   So, first of all, I think early release is the right thing to do .  I now know we can do it.  And I think not doing it puts us in a situation of less disc losure than seems appropri ate.  Having said all that, I think we should do it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  When we started this process, frankly, I was quite dubious that this would be a successful operation.  I’m plea sed to say that I was mistaken.  I thought the staff ran an exceptionally effective demons tration that this is a feasible operation.  In the course of discussing the different alternatives as we went forward in the various iterations, I think we 96 of 118   probably enhanced our under standing of the process an d how it was functioning.  So in that regard, I think the experiment has worked. I’m not concerned, as you  are, Cathy, about the question of the tradeoff  with respect to the statements and the minutes, larg ely because I don’t look at the forward-looking statements as something we’ll be continuing  in the future.  I look at that as an  historical aberration that enabled us to do forward-looking projections and stick with them, because we ha d this extraordinary period of increasing productivity growth for a long period of time.  That esse ntially put us in a position of significant control over inflation—indeed, we had declining unit labor cost s—which enabled us to effectively say that we were not concerned abou t inflation for the peri od ahead, kn owing that productivity growth doesn’t change all that quickl y.  We were, therefore, able to engage in an experiment with our statements th at lasted for well over a year. I submit to you that th at was the aberration and that the fu ture will not look that way.  We are going to find, when we eventually unwind fro m this “measured pace” approach that we’re not going to be able—credibly—to reproduce that kind of description of monetary policy in the future, at least not without very extraord inary events occurring.  So I think the issue is moot.  When this period has ended and we’ve reache d where we wish to go with th is policy of “de-accommodation,” I think we will go back to a very short term, ba lanced focus and give th e type of indication of Federal Reserve policy that  existed in the past. I think that there are risks to moving forward on  this early release of the minutes, but I agree with the way Bill put it—name ly, that it’s a close call.   The way I would phrase it essentially is that, if we move forward and we find out in retrospect that it was a mist ake, the cost is not all that large.  It’s certainly not as large as I thin k it would be were we to decide to  move the transcript timing from five years to six weeks and found ou t that we were wrong.  Since we  cannot reverse in either case, I 97 of 118   think the costs in the latte r case would be far greater than if we  to move to the three-week window on the minutes and find out that was a mistake.  We can live with that; I thin k we can live with it in a way that might require us to chan ge the way we handle the minutes or what we say in the minutes.  But it’s not going to be a big deal. So I would lean toward follo wing Vincent’s recommendation that we begin expedited release of the minutes at the Fe bruary 2005 meeting and mainta in a schedule of releasing the minutes of regular meetings three weeks after the da y of the policy decision.  Since I perceive that that’s largely the accepted view of  this Committee, I’d suggest that we put that on the table for a vote.  Call the roll. 

[SECTION]

MS. DANKER. Chairman Greenspan  Yes Vice Chairman Geithner Yes Governor Bernanke  Yes Governor Bies   Yes Governor Gramlich  Yes President Hoenig   Yes Governor Kohn  Yes President Minehan  Yes,  I guess.  [Laughter]  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This, inci dentally, is a full vote of  both the Presidents and the Governors on the grounds that it’s a decision that  relates to the policy of  the Committee, and all members and potential members, in my judgm ent, should vote. 

[SECTION]

MS. DANKER.  Okay.  I’ll pick up the ot hers in a moment. Governor Olson  Yes President Pianalto  I can’t repeat Cathy’s way of saying yes, but—  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  “Yes, I guess” is a formal vote.  MS. PIANALTO.  Okay.  Yes.    98 of 118  

[SECTION]

 MS. DANKER. President Poole  I’m persuaded.  Yes President Guynn  Yes President Lacker  Yes President Moskow  Yes President Santomero  Yes President Stern   Yes President Yellen  Yes First Vice President Holcomb Yes  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I just want to congratulate Vinc ent on an extraordinarily well-done job. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSCOW.  Mr. Chairman?  I congratulate  you, too, Vincent,  but may I make one minor suggestion? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Instead of waiting  to announce this in the minutes that will come out right after the February meeting, I would announce it early in January for se veral reasons.  One, I think it would give more time to the markets to be aware of this ch ange.  If we put it in  the minutes of this meeting, which would be released after our February mee ting, that would give market participants about twelve trading days before  a new set of minutes—those fo r the February meeting—will be released.  Second—and I hate to say this—there’s always a chance of a leak .  I would hate to see this come out before  we announce it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think th at’s a good point.  But let me ask this:  What are the reasons not to announce it earlier? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Yes.  Let me ta ke that a step further.  Wh at if we put something about this in our st atement today? 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Exactly. 99 of 118  

[SECTION]

 MR. MOSKOW.  I would strongly support that, if you can do it .  I would do it as soon as possible.  I thought you’ d want to draft some wording and have  the Committee look at it first. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me pu t it this way.  I heard no discussion here that in any way would preclude announcing this decision today, given that we’ve come to a conclusion and that it was effectively unanimous —with a couple of “I gue ss” votes.  [Laughter]  So unless there’s an objection, I would submit that it’s certainly possible to do this today.  We have the time to put a sentence in the statement indicating what the Committee concluded and vot ed on regarding this issue today. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  One possibility, Mr. Chairman, is  basically to pick up the language that you, in fact, voted on:  “The Committee voted un animously to begin expedited release of the minutes with the minutes of the February 2005 mee ting and to mainta in a schedule of releasing the minutes of regular meetings three weeks after the date  of the policy decision.”  I would also suggest that we put more detail, in terms of a paragraph or  two, in the minutes of this meeting, so that and market participants  will get more explanat ion at a later date. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Fine.  That’s excellent. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN.  Mr. Chairman , will there be a ques tion of why we’re no t proceeding with early release of the minu tes for this meeting? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’d say it’s because the discussion of this issue occurred subsequent to the vote on the policy decision. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Should  there be some discussion abou t nineteen votes versus twelve in that statement? 100 of 118  

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me  go back.  That would be  the answer, but we could certainly move it up if— 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  As long as we’re  into this, what’s the problem?  If we can release the 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  We coul d release these minutes in three weeks, if you so direct.  I thought there were certain advantages to having  a paragraph or two expl aining why th e Committee made this decision and giving details of how the Committee would do this going forward before those in the market actually  got the first release. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is that really necessary? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  Not if you say it isn’t.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, I think the logic of our deci sion forces us into the position of doing precisely what Governor Gramlic h is suggesting.  Let me ask, Are there any dissents to actually releasin g the minutes of today’s meeting on an expedited basis? 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  May I suggest one possible benefit of waiting?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  By all means, go ahead. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  You can all shout it down, but it occurs to me that one possib le benefit is to give people who follow our ev ery word—and there are many pe ople around who do—a longer period of time to get used to the idea and to re ad the minutes of some previous meetings in the context of what was going on at the time.  They  could calm themselves down in time to get the 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Three weeks is a long time.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  All right.  I’ m willing to be shouted down on that.  But that’s the only reason I can think of for waiting. 101 of 118  

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Are ther e any arguments that anyone  can think of?  The date these minutes would be released w ould be January 4.  If it were  Christmas Day, I think it would create a problem. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON.  Mr. Chairman, ei ther we are going to do this  or we aren’t.  We can’t start out by immediately saying, “Oh, well, that date is not very convenient.”   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let’s at least think of what we intend to do.  The proposition currently on the table is (1) to announce that we’re going to rel ease the minutes early and (2) to do it in three weeks.  I haven’t heard serious objectio ns, nor have I heard serious reasons—which are far more important—not to pr oceed.  So unless I hear objections fr om anybody, I would read it as the consensus of this Committee to make the statement that we’re going  to do it and to actually do it as of January 4.  Is that acceptable to everybody? 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So be it. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairman, just  one more question or suggestion for Vincent.  Maybe you’ve already considered this.  When you release the mi nutes for the first time, you might want to consider addi ng some of the Secr etariat’s clarifying information about the conventions in the language—an expl anation of some of the terminolog y.  I don’t know if you were intending to do that, but I think it would be helpful  

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.  I did want to make clear the distin ction between “p articipants” and “members.”  

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  And the hier archy of the language around the terms “majority” and “several” and so forth might be helpful, too. 102 of 118  

[SECTION]

 MR. REINHART.  We thoug ht of m aking a little index card that we co uld hand out to Fed watchers.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  We can expect to be asked if we are one of the “few” or one of the “many.” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  May we leave that is sue of explaining the terminology to the Secretariat to make a judgment on? 

[SECTION]

SEVERAL.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  In that  event, I want to confirm that the dates of our next meeting are Tuesday and Wednesday, February 1 and 2, 2005.  This  meeting is adjourned, and we are off to have lunch with our former colleague, Bob McTeer.
