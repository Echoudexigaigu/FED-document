CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good af ternoon, everyone.  I think you all are aware that this is the last meeting Governor Gram lich plans to attend.  There will be a lunche on in his honor after the meeting ends tomorrow.  It’s also the last mee ting for Ed Ettin, who will retire at the end of July, and for Marvin Goodfriend from the Richmond Bank, who will move to Carnegie Me llon at the end of the summer.  We’ll miss all of  them.  Ed, as some of us know, has been attending FOMC meetings since the late 1970s, an d Marvin has been attending sinc e 1993.  As for Ned, there are certain special things that I’m going to say abou t him tomorrow, wh ich I won’t repeat here.  We’ll let him be a little nerv ous.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I’ve got a few things to say, too. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Ah, but I will have the gavel!  The first item on the agenda is the selection of Richard T. Free man as an Associate Economist of the FOMC to serve until the election of a successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in 2006.  Would somebody like to move that nomination? 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I’ll mo ve that nomination. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Withou t objection, that is approved .  We will be discussing a special topic today at your request, housing valuations and monetary policy.  You’ve obviously received the documents the st aff has distributed.  Mine are buried in this stack here; I have them.  Let’s turn now to Dave Stockton. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.  We have five  briefings this afternoon and the issues covered in those briefings are so intertwi ned that we thought it would be best if we just                                              3 The materials used by Messrs. Gallin, Lehnert, Peach, Rudebusch, and Williams are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).  4 of 234presented all five and then opened the floor for di scussion and questions afterward.  We recognize that a long presentation, coming right after lunch and while a numbe r of you are still probably a bit jet-lagged, could test your powers of concentration, but I think you’ll find the presenters to be both well informed and entertaining.  [Lau ghter]  So with that we’ll begin.  

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.3 Thank you. My presentation begins on the th ird page of the handout you received. It seems that everybody is  talking about house prices, and the upper panel of your first exhibit shows why:  House prices, adjusted for ge neral inflation, have risen at a rapid pace in recent years and did no t even pause during the last recession. Indeed, the real rate of appreciation has increased, and the most r ecent readings have been at annual rates greater than 7 per cent.  By comparison, the average annual increase in real house prices during the pa st 30 years is only about 1¾ percent. The next two panels illustrate some of  the eye-popping gains that have been recorded in selected metropo litan areas.  For example, as  shown in the middle left panel, real house prices increased about 16  percent in San Fran cisco and 30 percent in Las Vegas during the four-quarter period ending in the first quarter; as shown to the right, the most re cent gain was 13 percent in New Yo rk and 20 percent in Miami.   Rapid price appreciation has sparked deba te about whether ho using has become overvalued, and the popular press is filled wi th stories suggesting that it has.  As summarized in the lower left  panel, anecdotes suggesting that the housin g market is overheated include those about increased sp eculation, purchase decisions that are perhaps too dependent on rosy assessments of future appreciation, and increased reliance on novel forms of fina ncing without full recognition of the associated risks.  Although these anecdotes are suggestive,  they do not provide a benchmark for valuing housing.  Two approaches that do provide a benchmar k are listed to the right.  One is to ask if housing is affordable  for a typical family.  Some analysts have argued that prices are too hi gh relative to incomes, while others say low interest rates have kept required monthly mortgage paymen ts affordable.  Another approach is to ask if house prices are properly aligned with  rents.  I have pursued both approaches in my research, and have co ncluded that rents provide a preferable benchmark for valuing housing. I w ill therefore focus my prepared remarks on this approach.    As summarized in the upper left panel of your next exhibit, a strength of this approach is that it employs a standard a sset pricing framework, such as that often used in studies of stock market  valuation.  In th is framework, rental payments in the housing market are analogous to dividends in the stock market.  Seen this way, the                   5 of 234price of a house should reflect the appropriate ly discounted stream of expected rents; high prices could be justified by high re nts or by low carrying costs, which include interest payments, net taxes, and depreciation.  But if prices appear unusually high relative to rents and carrying co sts, one might conclude that housing is ov ervalued.   As highlighted to the right, I have implemented the framework using repeat-transactions price in dexes from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight [OFHEO] and Freddie Mac and the tenants’  rent index from the consumer price index.  I made several adjustments to these series to address some of the shortcomings of the publishe d data.  As you will see in Dick Peach’s presentation, he and I disagree about the best way to measure house pr ices.  I would be happy to discuss the issue during the question period.   That said, the red line in the middle pa nel shows the estimate d price-rent ratio for the stock of housing, a nd the black line shows the esti mated real carrying cost of housing. The first point to no te is that the me asured price-rent ratio is currently higher than at any earlier time for which we  have data.  Moreover, the run-up in prices appears to be far greater  than can be explained by ca rrying costs, at  least if we use the historical relationship  between the two series as our  guide.  Alth ough theory suggests a tight link between carrying costs and the price-rent ra tio, the data  suggest that the actual link is more te nuous.  At the simp lest level, while th e price-rent ratio is at a historical high, the carrying cost is  not at a historical low.  More formally, regression analysis suggests that prices are about 20 percent too high given rents and carrying costs.    One might reasonably ask wh at this potential 20 per cent overvaluation portends for house prices.  The lower panel summari zes the historical experience on this question.  The panel shows a scatter plot of  the price-rent ratio (on the horizontal axis) and changes in real house prices over the subsequent three years (on the vertical axis); the panel al so includes a fitted regression line.  As I mentioned a moment ago, carrying costs are only slightly correlated with the price-rent ratio.  Thus, their effects can be excluded from the ch art without materially affecting the results. The downward slope of the regression line summarizes a key finding: When house prices have been high relative to  rents, subsequent price changes have typically been smaller than us ual.  For example, on the right side of the panel we can see that in the second quarte r of 1979, the price-rent ra tio stood above 24, and real prices decreased 7 percent during the subsequent three years.  Near the other end of the scale, in the third quarter of 1970 th e price-rent ratio stood just above 19, and real prices increased more than 5 perc ent during the subsequent three years.  However, as is readily apparent from the chart, the relationshi p is loose.  Most notably, in the first quarter of 2002, the la st observation for which we have a reading for the subsequent three-year change in house prices, the pr ice-rent ratio stood at 22.  Although the regression suggests that real prices should have been about flat since                      6 of 234then, real prices actually incr eased more than 20 percent, and the price-rent ratio rose to about 27—literally off the chart.   To give an impression of  what has happened in local  markets, the upper panel of your next chart summarizes housing- market conditions for four metropolitan areas:  San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Miami.  The panel displays the deviation of each city’s pri ce-rent ratio from its long-ru n level in the second quarter of 1979 (the red bars), the fourth quarter of 1989 (the  black bars), and the first quarter of 2005 (the green bars ).  The numbers above the ba rs indicate their height.  The first two episodes represent previous pe aks of the price-rent ratio at the national level. The third episod e is where we are now. The numbers below the red and black bars  show the performance of real house prices in each city in the three years following each epis ode.  For instance, as shown by the red bar, the price-rent ratio in San Francisco was 7 percent above its long-run level in the middle of 1979.  During the su bsequent three years, real house prices there fell 5 percent.  At the end of 1989 (the black bar) the price-rent ratio in San Francisco was 15 percent above its long-ru n level, and real prices there fell 12 percent during the subsequent three y ears.  The most recent reading for San Francisco indicates that the price-rent ratio is now further above its long-run level than in either 19 79 or 1989.   The price-rent ratios sugges t that housing is overvalued in the other three cities as well, but to differing degrees.  Alth ough the price-rent ratio in New York is elevated, housing does not lo ok much more overvalued th ere than it did in the late 1980s.  House prices appear elevated relative to rents in  Chicago as we ll, but it is Miami that stands out as the most overh eated of the four markets shown here.   The evidence that I have shown you so far suggests that rents provide a loose tether for house prices; prices deviate from  their long-run relationship with rents for extended periods, but not inde finitely.  However, to pr ovide a forecast of house prices, we must consider both the long-run relationship between prices and rents and the short-run dynamics among prices and other economic factors.  The middle left panel of your exhibit lists several factors th at affect real house-price dynamics in the short run.  In particular, the Board’s st aff has found that a basic model should include lagged changes in house prices, as well as changes in real income, real carrying costs, and the unempl oyment rate.  This basic model does not take a stand on whether housing is overvalued.  Alternat ively, our error-corr ection model adds to the basic model the lagged level of the price-rent ratio and the lagged level of carrying costs.  It therefore provides a formal way to model short-run dynamics around a long-run equilibrium  level.  The estimated co efficient on the lagged price-rent ratio is negative, capturing the idea that there is a long-run relationship between house prices and rents and th at price changes are restrain ed when prices are high relative to rents.                           7 of 234The middle right panel shows the implicatio ns of these two models for the four-quarter percent change in real house pr ices at the national level during the Greenbook forecast period.  The basic model—in green—s uggests that house prices will decelerate in the coming tw o years, but that th ey will still rise faster than their long-run average of about 1¾ percent per year.  Thus, even a model that ignores the long-run relationship between the levels of prices and rents predicts a slowdown in house-price appreciation. S till, housing would become slightly more overvalued relative to rents at the end of the forecast period.   The error-correction model—in red—calls for prices to decelerate more in the coming two years, with real prices actua lly edging down a bit in 2006.  In this scenario, housing would be ab out 15 percent overvalued at the end of the forecast period. Note that the J une Greenbook forecast—the black line—lies between the two model simulations.  To sum up, the statistical evidence that I have presented today provides support for the view that the price-rent ratio can be a useful tool fo r summarizing housing valuations.  The price-rent ratio is curren tly very high by historical standards, suggesting that housing might be overvalued  by as much as 20 pe rcent.  Historical experience suggests that the change in real house pri ces going forward will be slower than in recent years.   Unfortunately, the evidence  cannot rule out either further rapid gains in house prices for a time or a more rapid correction back to fundamentals.  Just as the price-dividend ra tio is an imperfect tool for forecasting stock prices, the price-rent ratio should  be considered only a rough guide to valuations in the housin g market. Thank you.

MR. LEHNERT. As Josh noted, everyone’s talking about house prices; but they also seem to be talking a great deal  about mortgages.  The popular consensus appears to be that homebuyer s, especially in hot housing  markets, now make token down payments and can just scrape into their homes by resorting to interest-only mortgages; in this view, borrowers and le nders alike are vulnera ble to any fall in house prices.  In my prepared remarks I will address each  of these issues. An obvious measure of the vulnerability of  a borrower to a de cline in his house price is the ratio of the current mortgage balance to the current value of his home; this ratio is known as the current loan-to-va lue, or LTV, ratio.  The top panel of your first exhibit compares the distribution of the estimated current LTV as of September 2003 (the black bars) with the distribution as of March 2005 (the red bars). As shown by the leftmost red bar, 64 percent of bor rowers currently have LTVs below 70 percent.  Moving to the right,  a further 18 percent currently have LTVs between 70 and 79 percent; 14 percent ha ve LTVs between 80 and 89 percent; and only 4 percent have LTVs of 90 percent and above.  Moreover, the recent rapid appreciation in house prices has actually out stripped mortgage debt growth, so that the average LTV has fallen over the past 18 months.               8 of 234The middle left panel uses the same data  to concentrate on the most leveraged borrowers.  For a given drop in nominal ho use prices (the horizontal axis), the vertical axis gives the percent of borrowe rs who would have negative equity.  As before, the black line reflects data from September 2003 wh ile the red li ne reflects the most recent data.  As sh own by the red line, following  a house-price drop of 10 percent, an estimated 4 percent of borrowers would have negative equity, while a drop of 20 percent would leave about 18 pe rcent of borrowers in negative territory. The middle right panel summarizes aver age LTVs at origination for homes purchased in 2004 , by state, relative to price ap preciation in that state over the previous four years.  States with lowe r-than-average appreciation, such as Utah, Texas, and Oklahoma, are at  the left, while states with faster-than-average appreciation, such as California, Massachuset ts, and New York are at the right.  As shown, LTV at origination in 2004 wa s actually lower in states with more appreciation. Thus, homebuyers in Califor nia and other high-appreciation states made larger down payments relative to th e price of their house than homebuyers in low-appreciation states such as Oklahoma.   Increasing home equity, main ly driven by rising h ouse prices, has supported mortgage credit quality in r ecent quarters.  The bottom le ft panel plots delinquency rates for loans held on banks ’ books (the black line) as well as for the broader MBA [Mortgage Bankers Association] measur e (the red line).  Both have fallen significantly in  recent years. The bottom right panel summarizes the vulnerability of borrowers to house-price shocks.  The average LTV on mortgages has declined over the past 18 months, and most households currently have substant ial equity in their ho mes.  In the past few years, borrowers have benefited from rapidly rising  house prices, which have kept mortgage delinquencies at extremel y low levels.  Howeve r, an estimated 4 percent of borrowers are highly leveraged an d could lose all of their home equity if house prices were to fall 10 percent. As I noted earlier, recent anecdotal repor ts have highlighted a second potential risk lurking within mortgage markets—th e sudden popularity  of interest-only mortgages.  These are the s ubject of your next exhibit. The statistics presented in exhibit 2 are taken exclusively from  data on private-label—that is, non-GSE [government-spon sored enterprise]—residential mortgage-backed securities, or  RMBS, pools.  The overwhelming  advantages of these pools for my purposes are that they are very transparent; that is , a great deal of information is available on the underlying mortgage s and that they contain many heterodox mortgages, including interest -only mortgages.  Many of the recent press articles citing the growth of  novel mortgages are based on RMBS pool data and thus, because such mortgages are ov errepresented in RMBS pools, have exaggerated, in my view, the role of heterodox mortgages.                  9 of 234Turning to the data, line 1 of the top left panel shows that the dollar value of RMBS pools has nearly double d over the past two years.   Moreover, as shown in line 2, RMBS pools backed by interest-only, or IO, mortgages have increased almost sixfold, and now amount to nearly $300 billion.  Howe ver, total ho me mortgage debt, line 3, has also increased over the past  two years.  As show n in the memo line, interest-only RMBS pools now account for 3.6 percent of all home mortgage debt, up from less than 1 percent tw o years ago, but still a small share of  all mortgages. As their name implies, interest-only mo rtgages do not require the borrower to make principal payments, at least during an init ial period.  Borrow ers willing to use IO mortgages could qualify for a larger mort gage and thus be able to buy a more expensive house. The top right panel gives some idea of the relationship between price appreciation and the popu larity of IO mortgages.  The vertical axis shows the fraction of IO mortgages used to purchase houses, by state,  in 2004.  Ag ain, I should emphasize that the IO shares are calcula ted within the RMBS world, and so are probably overstated.  The horizontal axis gives state-level house-price appreciation from 1999 through 2003.  As  you can see, IO mortgages are somewhat more popular in states that saw more appreciation, although, as  seen in the inset box, the correlation is not particularly strong. While the principal value of  an IO loan doesn’t dec line, if the initial down payment is large enough, the borrower may have a substantial equity cushion against price shocks.  The middle panel reports th e LTV at origination for IO loans made over the past three years.  As shown,  most IO mortgages had LTVs below 80 percent, although the trend over time has been away from the very lowest LTVs.  That said, lenders have continued to make relatively few IO loans with LTVs above 80 percent.  Those higher LTV loans no w account for about 15 percent of all outstanding IOs. Finally, anecdotes often emphasize that IO loans are extended to borrowers with lower credit quality. Th e bottom panel shows the distribution of credit quality, measured by FICO scores, among IO borro wers.  As a rough approximation, most lenders define prime quality borrowers as th ose with FICO scores of 660 or above. The leftmost set of bars thus represents subprime borrowers.  As shown, between 8 and 10 percent of IO loans have been extended to these borrowers.  Moving to the right, the next two sets of bars show that the great majority of IO borrowers had solid credit scores between 660 and 779.  As shown by the rightmost set of bars, about 10 percent of IO bo rrowers had credit scores above 780.  On  the whole, therefore, the credit quality of borrowers using interest-only loans does not appear particularly risky. One might wonder if financial institutions and invest ors have, in the face of the continuing housing boom, dropped their de fenses against the mo rtgage losses that would accompany a house-price bust.  The top left panel of your next exhibit lists the main institutio ns exposed to residential mortgage credit risk and the main types of mortgages held by th ese institutions.  The ho using GSEs, line 1, almost                          10 of 234exclusively hold or guarantee conforming mortgages with fixed rates.  Private mortgage insurers, line 2, insure the component of mortgage principal that exceeds 80 percent of the property’s value and so are effectively exposed to the credit risk associated with high-LTV lo ans.  RMBS pools (line 3), as well as bank s and thrifts (line 4), hold a wide variety of different mortgage types, including traditional fixed-rate mortgages as well as variable-rate and junior liens. The top right panel emphasizes that the housing GSEs hold very  little credit risk. As shown on line 1, the average LTV at origin ation of GSE-guaranteed mortgages was 70 percent; based on region al house-price appreciation, the estimated current LTV of these mortgages (line 2) has fallen to 57 percent.  The average credit score of the underlying borrowers (line 3) is  also solidly in the “prime” category.  Obviously, these average values mask some  variation in the borrower population, which no doubt contains some  higher-risk borrowers.  Howe ver, as shown on line 4, 19 percent of the mortgages guaranteed by  the GSEs carry some form of credit enhancement.  If one of these mortgages defaults, the GSE receives a payment from the insurer, usually a private mortgage insura nce, or PMI, company. The middle left panel examines the health  of the PMI indust ry.  As shown by the black line (left ax is), the ratio of tota l insured mortgages to capital, the risk-capital ratio, has declined steadily over the past 10 years, indicating that PMI companies have historically high capital on  hand relative to the risks they insure.  The red line (right axis) shows net unde rwriting income—tha t is, income from premiums less losses and expenses, relative to  capital.  After suff ering large losses in the late 1980s, PMI compan ies have consistently recorded positive underwriting income. In sum, PMI compan ies appear to have built up a historically large cushion to absorb the losses that might be associat ed with a widespread drop in real estate values. The middle right panel analyzes the risks posed to investors in RMBS pools. These pools contain some of the riskier ou tstanding mortgages.  However, they are structured so that investors can choose their risk exposure.   Further, RMBS pools are exceptionally transparent, so investors have  extensive information on each mortgage in the pool.  In principle, investors should  have understood, and appropriately priced, the risks inherent in these mortgages.  In  practice, however, investors price these mortgages using loss models, which are esti mated using relatively little data from major house-price declines. The bottom two panels disc uss the exposure of the 8,900 bank s and thrifts in the United States to residential mortgage credit risk.  The panel to the left divides institutions into quartiles by the fraction of their port folios accounted for by residential mortgage assets, defined as whol e loans, home equity lines of credit, non-

[SECTION]

GSE RMBS pools, and residual tranches on  securitized mortgages.  As shown, for institutions in the bottom qu artile, mortgages account for le ss than 5 percent of total assets.  This fraction rises by quartile until, for institutions at the top, mortgages                  11 of 234account for more than 40 percen t of assets.  Residential mort gage credit risk is more concentrated at these instit utions than at the institut ions in the lower quartiles. The panel to the right show s the average size and ca pital-to-asset ratio of institutions in each of th e quartiles.  Reading down th e first colum n, which gives average institution size, one can see that smaller instituti ons are concentrated in the first two quartiles, which have relatively little mortgage exposu re.  Reading down the second column, which gives average tier  1 capital ratios, institutions in all quartiles are extremely well capitalized.  Thus, institutions with large amounts of mortgage credit risk on their portfolios ar e well positioned to ha ndle severe losses. To sum up, neither borrowers  nor lenders appear particularly shaky.  Indeed, the evidence points in the opposite direction:  borrowers have large equity cushions, interest-only mortgages are no t an especially sinister development, and financial institutions are quite healthy.  Nonetheless, even th e most sanguine analyst quails when contemplating a historic ally unprecedented drop in  nationwide nominal house prices.  Such a drop will obv iously hurt both borrowers and lenders and will also no doubt expose weaknesses that will only be obvious in hi ndsight.  Thus, perhaps it would be best simply to ve nture the judgment that th e national mortgage system might bend, but will likely not break, in the face  of a large drop in house prices.  That concludes my prepared remarks.

MR. PEACH. Hardly a day goes by without another an ecdote-laden article in the press claiming that the U.S. is experiencing a housi ng bubble that will soon burst, with disastrous consequences fo r the economy.  Indeed, housing market activity has been quite robust for some time now, with starts and sales of single-family homes reaching all time highs in  recent months and home prices rising rapidly, particularly along the east and west  coasts of the countr y.  But such activity could be the result of solid fundamentals underlying the housing market.  After all, both nominal and real long-term interest rates have declined substantially over the last decade.  Productivity growth has been  surprisingly strong since the mid-1990s, producing rapid real income growth primar ily for those in the upper half of the income distribution.  And the large ba by-boom generation has entered its peak earning years and appears to have strong preferences for large homes loaded with amenities.  One of the conditions of an asset bubble is that the pr ice of the asset has risen well above what is consistent with underlying fundamentals.  In the current debate, two measures of relative va lue have been applied to single-family ho me prices— price relative to income and rent relative to price.  In the comments  that follow I will concentrate on the price-to-income measure, but my conclusions apply equally to the rent-to-price measure.   In most analyses of the ratio of home price to income, the measure of home price that is used is the repeat-sales hom e price index published by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (exhibi t 1).  This index tracks changes in the                                        12 of 234average price of homes purc hased (or mortgages refinan ced) with loans purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or conformi ng conventional loans.  Therefore, it excludes cash sales as well as purchases or refinancings financed with FHA [Federal Housing Administration], VA [Veteran s Affairs], and jumbo conventional mortgages.  It is called a repeat-sales i ndex because it is derived by observing the sales prices—or appraised values, in the case of refinancings—of properties at specific addresses at two or mo re points in time .  Finally, it is a transactions-based index in that it reflects the prices of homes  that are sold (or re financed) rather than the entire universe of single-family homes. A lesser known home price index is the constant-quality new home price index published by the Bureau of the Census (exhibit 2).  This index is based on a sample  of new homes sold, regardless  of how the sale was fina nced.  Hedonic methods are  employed to hold the physical and locational characteristics consta nt over time. This index is part of the Census Bureau st atistical program thro ugh which the single-family residential investment deflator of th e national income and product accounts is  derived. As shown in exhibi t 3, the increase in prices indicated by these two indexes  is quite different.  For example, over the four years from 2000  to 2004, the OFHEO index increased at a compound annual rate  of 8.2 percent, while the constant-quality index increased at a 5.4 percent annual rate.  As shown in exhibit 4, the current ratio of price over median family  income derived from thes e two indexes is vastly different.  If the OFHEO inde x is giving an accurate pictur e of what is happening to home prices, I think one could say with so me confidence that pr ices have been bid up to unsustainable levels.  However, if the constant-quality index is a better reflection of reality, home  prices actually look somewh at low relative to median family income, particularly compared to the late 1970s.  I believe the constant-quality index provides a more accurate indicat ion of what is happening to the price of a typical single-family home.  In contrast, the OFHEO index is subject to upward biases that accumulate over  time and distort ratios su ch as price-to-income and  income-to-rents. To help us understand the biases in  the OFHEO index, exhibit 5 presents the distribution by value of all si ngle-family homes in the U.S. in 2003, with the specific values at the 25th, 50th, 75 th, and 80th percentiles. 4  The median value in 2003 was $150,000 with the distributio n skewed toward the right.  The value at the 25th percentile was $90,000 while the value at the 75th percentile was $250,000.  We do not know with certainty where  the OFHEO index falls on this distribution, as it is an index rather than a series of  values.  But we can be reas onably certain that it lies somewhere between the average price of al l existing single-fam ily homes sold and the average price of homes purchased with conventional loans.  That means the OFHEO index is a closer reflection of what is  happening at the 75th percentile rather  than the 50th percentile.  More over, it is very lik ely that over time the point on that  distribution represented by the OFHEO inde x has been drifting to the right.  One  4 In the American Housing Survey, home values are self-reported.  Previous research has concluded that self-reported values tend to overstate some what the price at which a property would actually sell.  We are limited to the 80th percentile due to top coding of the home value variable.                                    13 of 234cause of this rightward drift is what I call transaction bias.  As shown in exhibit 6, the American Housing Survey (AHS) data suggest that both appreciation rates and turnover rates increase as one moves out th e home value distribu tion.  For example, from 1997 to 2003 the compound annual rate of appreciation at the 25th percentile was 4.5 percent, increasing to  8.7 percent at the 80th percentile.  Corresponding average turnover rates for th e period from 1997  to 2003 were 5.9 percent and 7.4 percent.  That means, of course, that the av erage rate of apprecia tion of the units that turn over is higher than the average rate of ap preciation of the entire distribution.  While the amount of bias  in any one year is likely to be small, it does cumulate over time and becomes quite important when one is comparing levels versus income or rents. Another potential upward bias  in the OFHEO index is th at while it is a repeat-sales index, there is evidence  to suggest that it is not a constant-quality index.  In  addition to the strong pace of new housing starts, anot her aspect of the housing boom of the past decade has be en a significant increase a dditions and alterations to  the existing housing stock.  Exhibit 7 pres ents in the top pane l the ratio of the OFHEO index over the constant-quality i ndex plotted over the  period from 1977 to the present.  In the lower panel are plo tted real improvements per unit of housing stock per year over the same  period.  Over the past decade real improvements per  unit have increased about 25 percent, which appears to be associ ated with a further increase in the ratio of the OFHEO index over the co nstant-quality home price index.  Research suggests  that higher-income househol ds have a higher income  elasticity of demand for impr ovements to their primary residences, suggesting that  this source of upward bias is  likely to be more pronounced in the right half of the distribution of all single-family homes. 5 Another way of looking at the issue of home  prices over income is to go back to  the AHS data and see what is happening at various points on the distribution of all  single-family homes.  This information is presented in exhibit 8.  At the 25th  percentile the ratio of  home price to income  has been relatively  stable, while it has increased sharply at the 75 th and 80th percen tiles, reminiscent of the price-to­income  ratio computed  with the OFHEO inde x.  Let me pause just a moment and emphasize that I am comparing home prices at a percentil e with the incomes of the  people who live in those ho mes at the same percentile. This chart is likely the equivalent of the finding that the increase  of home prices has been most pronounced in areas of the country where home prices were already rela tively high due in part to relatively inelastic supply. It  is likely that in these area s of the countr y, where land values are high, the inclination to make  substantial improvements to existing properties is the greatest. Clearly, not everyone agrees that the constant-quality new home price index provides an accurate indicatio n of what is happ ening to the price of a typical single-family home.  For example, it has been  argued that most new construction takes  5 See Joseph Gyourko and Joseph Tracy (2005), “Using Home Maintenance and Repairs to Smooth Variable Earnings,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Working Paper Series.                         14 of 234place at the fringe of  metropolitan areas where land prices may not  be rising as fast as is intra-marginal land.  There are seve ral counter arguments.  First, the theory leading to the conclusion that intra-marginal land values increase at a faster rate than land at the fringe is  based on a theory of  the development of a metropolitan area with fairly restrictive assumptions.  Modern  metropolitan area s have multiple commercial/employment centers.  Many hous eholds have preferences for rural or suburban residences over urban residences.  Restrictions on development to counter suburban sprawl have reported ly resulted in sharp increase s in prices of parcels of land suitable for home building.   Finally, I would like to  note that the increases in land prices implicit in the constant-quality home price index, shown in exhibit 9, are substantial, particularly in the Northeast and th e West.  These estimates were derived assuming that land represents 50 percent of the value of the total property and that the prices of the other inputs increase at the same rate in all regions of the country.   In closing, I would like to comment on one other aspect of the housing bubble issue that has received substa ntial attention.  Earlier this  year a major real estate related trade association releas ed the results of a survey indicating that a significant percentage of single-family home sales we re of investment pr operties and second homes.  This was widely interpreted as evidence of speculativ e buying of rental properties, another feature of a housing bubb le.  Again, I believe that such reports should be viewed skeptica lly.  According to the AHS , in 2003 single-family investment properties, defined as homes rent er-occupied or for re nt, represented 14.2 percent of all single-famil y homes while second homes  represented another 4.7 percent.  Therefore, we should not be surp rised that such proper ties represent about 20 percent of the sales that take place at any point in time.  Moreover, the American Housing Survey data indicate that single-family investment pr operties have been absolute numbers from 2001 to 2003.  A prin cipal reason the rent al vacancy rate for single-family homes has risen in recent year s is that the number  of renter-occupied single-family homes has declined as people sw itch from renting to owning.  So if a lot of people are buying rental properties , it must also be the case that a lot are selling as well. That  concludes my report .  Thank you.

MR. RUDEBUSCH. I will review some general issues related to monetary policy and asset prices.  Let me start—at the top of page 1—by  assuming that an asset price can, in theory at least, be  separated into a component determined by underlying economic fundamentals and a n on-fundamental or bubble component.  An asset price may be in line with its fundamentals, so the bubble component is zero, or bubbles could be positive or negative—perhaps representing irrational euphoria or pessimism.   Two types of monetary polic y responses to movements in an asset price have been proposed.  I refer to the first type as “Standard Policy” because there is widespread agreement that it represents the minimum appropriat e policy response.  The Standard Policy responds to an asset price to the ex tent it conveys information to the central bank about the future path of output and inflation—the goal variables                      15 of 234of monetary policy.  For ex ample, a booming stock mark et is usually followed by higher demand and increased inflationary pressures, so tighter policy would be needed to offset these conseq uences.  Even for the Standa rd Policy resp onse, it will likely be useful to identify, if possible, the separate components of the asset price.  In particular, the bubble component may e xhibit more volatile dynamics and be a pernicious source of macroe conomic risk, so opt imal policy would li kely react more to bubbles than to movements in  the fundamental component.   The second type of response, the “Bubbl e Policy,” follows th e Standard Policy as a base case, but, in certain  circumstances, it also takes steps to contain or reduce the asset price bubble.  Proponents of a Bu bble Policy argue that movements in the bubble component can have serious adve rse consequences for macroeconomic performance that monetary policy cannot readily offset after the fact, so it is preferable to try to eliminate this source of macroeconomic fluctuations directly.  Furthermore, because bubble s often seem to display a self-reinforcing behavior, a little preemption and prevention early  on can avoid later excesses. A best-case scenario for these two policies is illustrated in th e lower half of the first page.  Under ideal ci rcumstances, the policymaker  knows the fundamental and bubble components, and as history unfolds, the Standard Policy would likely recommend higher interest rates to offset  any economic stimul us generated by the bubble before the crash and lower rates afterward.  A Bubble Policy would go further and try to mitigate the fluctuations  in the bubble and ac hieve an asset price path like AP′t . This would likely require higher  interest rates than the Standard Policy before the crash and lower rates afte rward, and it will likely trade off near-term deviations from the central bank ’s macroeconomic goals for better overall macroeconomic performance later on.  Th e fundamental difference between the two policies is that the Standard  Policy takes the bubble com ponent essentially as given or exogenous, while the Bubbl e Policy takes into  account the endoge nous nature of the bubble component—specifically, a linkage  between the policy instrument and the bubble.  A decision tree for choosing between the Standard and Bubble Policies is shown on page 2.  In brief, it asks thre e questions: (1) Can policymakers identify a bubble?  (2) Will fallout from a bubble be significant and hard to rectify ex post? and (3) Is monetary policy the right method to use to  deflate the bubble? The answer to the first question—can po licymakers identify a bubble?—is “no” if the particular asset price appears aligne d with fundamentals.  Some have argued that this is nearly alwa ys the case because estimate s of fundamentals are so imprecise and because asset prices reflect the collective informa tion and wisdom of professional traders in organized markets.  If policymakers cannot discern a bubble, then the Standard Policy is the only feasible response. But suppose an asset price bubble is identified.  Th en the second hurdle is whether bubble fluctuations have signific ant macroeconomic fallout that monetary                         16 of 234policy cannot readily o ffset after the fact.  A negative answer to this question is appropriate in two situations.  First, if the bu bble is in an asset ma rket that is small in domestic economic terms—for example, a localized re al estate market—then a central banker should avoid a ttempts at asset price realig nment.  Second , even when there are significant macroeconomic conseq uences from an asse t price bubble boom and bust, if they occur with a sufficient lag so the policymaker can adopt a wait-and­see attitude, then the Standard Policy is ag ain appropriate.  This  second case seems relevant if fluctuations in  the bubble component have only conventional effects on aggregate demand and supply through changes in wealth, the cost of capital, and balance sheets.  Then, to a first approximation, the lags involved in these channels are about as long as the lags  in the monetary transmission mechanism; therefore, the Standard Policy should suffice.  For example, fluctuations in equity  prices will affect wealth and consumer demand , but a nimble central banker can essentially offset these consequences by changing interest rates in reaction to—that is, after—the equity price movements. Now to the case where asset price movements have significant macroeconomic consequences and those consequences are ha rd to clean up after the fact through monetary policy. The most often mentioned possibility is that a bursting asset price bubble will lead to a broad financial crisis and cred it crunch.  Such financial instability is likely to be tr ansmitted to the ec onomy much more qu ickly than can be offset by interest rate poli cy.  This may set the stage fo r invoking a Bubble Policy.  Another example is when the asset pri ce misalignment results  in significant misallocations of resources, which distor t aggregate demand and supply across sectors and over time and impede the achievement of the highest possible long-run economic growth.  For example, the dot-com bubble spurred overinvestment in fiber optic cable and decimated the provision of venture capital for new technology startups for years.  Of cour se, after the fact, it is diffi cult to unwind th ese problems with the blunt instrument of monetary polic y, and, depending on the specifics, it is possible to conceive of a situation in which reducing the bubble in advance is a preferred poli cy strategy. The final hurdle before invoking a Bubble Policy invo lves assessing whether monetary policy is the right way to deflat e the asset price bubble.  Ideally, for the Bubble Policy, a moderate adjustment of in terest rates could constrain the bubble and greatly reduce the risk of severe futu re macroeconomic dislocations.  However, bubbles, even if identified, often do no t appear influenced by monetary policy actions in a predictable way.  Furthermore, even if changing interest rates could alter the bubble path, such a strate gy may involve substantial costs, including near-term deviations from the macroeco nomic goals of the central ba nk as well as potential political or moral hazar d complications.  Fina lly, even if monetary policy can affect the bubble, alternative strategies to deflate it, such as changes in financial regulations or supervision, may be more ta rgeted and have a lower cost. This decision tree is a daunting triple jump, but not  a total prohibition against bubble reduction.  Indeed, page 3 suggests different real-time answers to these three                      17 of 234questions for two historical episodes.  The first episode is the run-up in the stock there was an equity price bub ble in the high-technology sector and perhaps in the overall market as well.  Also, during th at time, the possible capital misallocation from the run-up in prices  and the possible financial instability that might have followed a bursting of the bubb le may have appeared diffic ult to rectify.  However, it was also unlikely that mone tary policy could have deflated the equity price bubble without substantial cost s to the economy.  In  the event, of cour se, a Bubble Policy was not followed, but arguab ly, the consequences from an y bubble boom and bust have been manageable.  A different example is provided by the bond market collaps e in 1994.  One could argue that this “inflation scare,” whic h pushed up yields on 30-year bonds by over 2 percentage points, resulted in an asset price misalignmen t that was fairly apparent to the FOMC during the second half of 1994.  If this bond bubble had persisted, the widespread propagation of the associated fears of higher inflation could have had severe consequences that would have been costly to unwind with monetary policy later on. Fina lly, with regard to deflat ability, it did appear likely that monetary policy could guide bond pric es back to fundamen tals.  Indeed, one interpretation of the FOMC’s actions in 1994 is that it purposefully and successfully contained a bond market bubble with sizable increases in the funds rate.  It is an open question which of these two episodes is  the more relevant one today.  That concludes my remarks.

MR. WILLIAMS.  I’ll be refe rring to the exhibits beginning on page 26.  In my presentation today, I’ll la y out a few scenarios that  illustrate the potential macroeconomic fall out resulting from a si gnificant decline in hou se prices, and I will examine policy responses that minimize it.   I’ll start by describing the possible size of the current problem—assuming there is one. As pointed out in Dick Peach’s pr esentation, there are se rious difficulties in accurately measuring both actual and “fun damental” house pric es.  But, for the purposes of my presentation, I will take as a working hypothesis  that house prices are high relative to fundamentals—or, in terms of the decision tree that Glenn just laid out, I assume that the answer to his question 1 is “Yes, the asset price appears misaligned.” As Josh Gallin indicated, it  would take up to a 20 percent decline in house prices to bring the price-to-rent ratio  back in line with fundamentals.  With housing wealth standing at around $18 trillion today, su ch a drop in house prices would extinguish $3.6 tr illion of household wealth.  That ’s equal to about 30 percent of GDP.  Based on a marginal  propensity to consume fr om housing wealth of 3½ cents on the dollar, th is decline in wealth would entail a nearly 1½ percentage point increase in the personal saving rate.  An d, according to estima tes from the FRB/US model, it implies a 40 basis point reductio n in the long-run neut ral real funds rate. It may be useful to put th ese figures into context by  comparing them to those associated with the stock market overvalua tion reached in early 2000.  Stock prices                     18 of 234at that time were arguably some 50 to 70 percent overvalued .  Correction of prices to fundamentals at that time would have im plied a reduction in household wealth of $6.7 trillion, equal to about 70  percent of contemporaneous GDP.  In the event, stock lowest point was down $8.5 trillion.  There is consider able uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the effects of changes in stock market and housing wealth on household spending; nonetheless, it seem s clear the magnitude of the current potential problem is much smaller than, and pe rhaps only half as large as, that of the stock market bubble.  Of course, if house prices continue to soar—and in the San Francisco Bay Area, at least,  they show no signs of sl owing—the magnitude of the housing overvaluation problem  will rise as well.   A cautionary note worth em phasizing is that the monetary policy cushion available today, as measured  by the prevailing federa l funds rate, is noticeably smaller than it was in early 2000 at the peak  of the stock market.  The first question that come s to mind is: What should  monetary policy do, if anything, about the apparent overvaluation in house prices?  The answer to that depends crucially on the answer to Glenn’s second question: “Do bubble fluctuations result in la rge macroeconomic consequen ces that monetary policy cannot readily offset?”  Therefore, I now e xplore the effects of a bubble collapse and the ability of policy to respond effectively to them.   I consider three scenarios in which a housing bubble deflates relatively quickly. I use the FRB/US model to quantify these eff ects.  Note that for the materials posted last Wednesday, I based my simulations on the April Gree nbook projection.  I have since updated the simulations, and the ones that I will be showin g today are based on the extended June  Greenbook projection.  In each scenario, I assu me that house prices fall by 20 percen t relative to the baseline over the next 2½ years. In the first two scenarios, I consider th e effects of exogenou s declines in house prices that apparently come “out of th e blue;” the third sc enario considers the possibility of an interrelate d decline in both bond a nd house prices.  For each scenario, I consider two types of monetary policy response.  The first is the optimal perfect foresight policy that is very similar to those reported in past Bluebooks.  The path of policy is chosen to minimize th e sum of the squared deviations of the unemployment rate and the core PCE [per sonal consumption expenditures] price inflation rate from their re spective targets and the square d changes in the funds rate, with the latter receiving re latively little weight.  Perfect foresigh t means that the policymaker today has advance knowledge of  all future shocks to the economy.  I assume that the inflation objective is 1½ percent and that the unemployment rate target is 5 percent, equal to the staff’ s estimate of the NAIRU [non-accelerating inflation rate of unemploymen t].  The second policy is on e that responds only to events as they occur and does not resp ond directly to an ticipated future developments related to hous e prices.  For this purpose, I use a modified version of the Taylor rule, with a coefficient of 1 on  the output gap and of  ½ on the inflation                   19 of 234gap, and with the long-run natural rate of interest that  appears in the rule varying in accord with sustained changes in h ousing wealth and bond premiums. The second page of my e xhibit shows the results from  model simulations of a 20 percent decline in house prices, where onl y the standard channels included in the FRB/US model are in play.  For comparison, I have also plotted the baseline paths, based on the June extended Greenbook projection but modified under the assumption that monetary policy is set opt imally in the way I just described.  Because a decline in house pr ices primarily influences de mand, not suppl y, it does not pose a difficult tradeo ff between policy goals.  In  addition, according to the model, the macroeconomic effects play  out gradually and are moderate in magnitude, giving policy time to respond.  The optimal policy calls  for a path for the funds rate that averages about 3¼ perc ent during 2007 and 20 08—about 40 basis points below the baseline path.  Under this  policy, the unemployment and inflation rates are nearly the same as in  the baseline.  The very smal l rise in inflation reflects the effects of the depreciatio n of the dollar resulting from  the reduction in domestic interest rates. The modified Taylor rule is able to mimic the outcomes under the optimal policy reasonably well, indica ting that policy need not fully  anticipate future house-price declines to be effective,  but can simply respond to ev ents as they unfold.  Note that if the house-price decline were larger  (or the marginal pr opensity to consume out of housing wealth bigge r), then the policy implicatio n would simply be to cut rates by proportio nally more.    In summary, assuming that  the FRB/US model does a good job of capturing the macroeconomic implications of  declining house prices, su ch an event does not pose a particularly difficult ch allenge for monetary policy.   One lingering concern, however, is that the model may be missin g other important avenues by which large movements in house prices affect the eco nomy.  I now consider  a scenario that entertains that possibility.   In the second scenario, I incorporate extra-model spillo vers from falling house prices, presumably reflecting a decline in confidence and an extinguishing of household spending that had been fueled  by equity extraction from mortgage refinancing, as described in the “heigh tened spending response” simulation reported in the June Greenboo k.  Importantly, the demand sp illovers are assumed to have a very different dynamic from the model’s stan dard wealth effect: They kick in much more rapidly and eventually dissipate so th at they have no lo ng-run effects.  As shown in the next page of the exhibit, owin g to the extra drag from these spillovers, the optimal policy calls for a se ries of rate cuts, bringing the funds rate to 2¼ percent by the middle of next year.  The funds rate does not ag ain reach 3 percent until the spring of 2007. The optimal policy is able to stem the rise in unemployment that would otherwise occur at the cost of a mode st and short-lived uptic k in inflation.                    20 of 234The Taylor rule, however, is not as successful.  It fails  to anticipate the spillover effects and responds too timid ly once they occur.  Still,  it contains the rise in unemployment to only about ½ percentage po int above baseline and moves inflation slightly more rapidly toward the assumed inflation objective.  I should note that, given the uncertainty regarding the size and timing of such spillovers, the ideal outcome in the optimal policy simulation exaggerates the real-world ability of monetary policy to offset th e effects of such shocks. As I noted before, the th ought experiment behind these first two sets of simulations is that house pric es fall in a kind of vacuum , without any relationship to other events.  Some commentators have argu ed that the current high level of house prices is the outcome of a history of very  low interest rates and past house-price appreciation that has given rise to irrati onally optimistic expectations of future appreciation.  Indeed, a simple estimated equation relating the cu rrent price-to-rent ratio to the user cost of h ousing and past house-price appreciation does a reasonably good job of explaining much of the run-up in house prices over the past several years.  If this explanation holds water, a potential risk to housing prices and the outlook in general lies in the path of lo nger-term interest rates—which have been surprisingly low, given prev ailing economic conditions—and the usual behavior of term premiums.  Bond yields  could return to more norma l levels and in so doing contribute to a downward tr ajectory in house prices.  I explore such a possibility in the final scen ario, which builds on Scenario 2, and is the subject of the next  page of my exhibit.  I now  add the assumption that the term premiums on long-term bo nds rise by 75 ba sis points, relative to baseline, over the second half of this year and remain at these levels.  Th is aspect of the scenario is similar to an alternative s cenario reported in the June Greenbook.  This shock to bond premiums by itself reduces the long-te rm equilibrium real funds rate by about 70 basis points.  Optimal policy calls for the funds rate to  fall below 1 percent by the middle of next year and for the funds rate to remain below 3 pe rcent through 2008.  The optimal policy is just able to contain the rise in unemployment without confronting the zero bound.  The Taylor rule, on the other hand, responds too gradually to events, and, as a result, the unemployment rate re aches 6 percent in early 2007. This scenario presents a difficult challe nge for monetary policy, especially in light of the looming zero lowe r bound on interest  rates under the optimal policy.  More generally, it highlights that the risks posed by a house-price decline are magnified if they occur in tandem with other even ts that damp econom ic activity.     In addition, as Glenn mentioned, a house-price misalignment may misallocate resources to housing-related activities.  These conditions suggest considering Glenn’s question 3, whether an  alternative policy is needed that aims to deflate a house-price overvaluation before it grows to o large—the subject of the next page of my exhibit.  The potential ef fectiveness of such a preemptiv e policy, however, is less than clear. The basic empirical relationship  between house prices, interest rates, and                   21 of 234other factors, upon which such a policy necessarily would re ly, is imperfectly understood and may have changed over time .  Moreover, as seen in the earlier presentations, there remains consider able uncertainty over the degree of overvaluation.  Thus, the successful use of  monetary policy to reduce the magnitude of a misalignment of house prices would be a daunting task, even assuming that such  a goal were deemed desirable.  This  concludes our prepared remarks.   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. We’re here to answer your questions and to listen to your discussion.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, I believe there is a very critical statistical difference here which, before we get very  far down the road, I think requires resolution.  You three gentlemen are talking about different sets of reality, and you’ re using the same basic data system.  You all use  the American Housing Surv ey, you use OFHEO, and you use the Census pri ce index.  I’ve heard comments from a few of you pe riodically on such matters. There are a couple of issues th at I find striking here.  One is how little we apparently know, at least as has been co mmunicated to me, on th e effect of the underlying land prices that are involved in all of these indexes.  You can’t ge t the land price out of the American Housing Survey.  I don’t believe it’s in the decennial  housing surveys.  We do have farmland prices by county, and one would presumably be ab le to pick up what was going on at  the fringe of various residential operations—it sounds like a tortuous job—but that still doesn’t solve th e underlying question of what the ratio of land is to other values.  And it strikes me that we need to come to grips with some of these issues, if for no other re ason than I think it’s  probably our job—because no one else seems to be taking it on—to try to second-guess the data that we’re getting.  Nob ody is raising the question about the quality of th e Loanperformance data and the fact that we’re deal ing with private pools, which I presume are in the data th at are being put together with re spect to the proportion of IO loans. I assume that conforming  mortgages do not include IOs.  Or do they?  Are there parts of these pools that do?                   22 of 234MR. LEHNERT. An interest- only mortgage can be purchased  by a GSE if it’s below the conforming loan limit. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  And how much of th e GSE portfolio includ es IO loans?  Do we know? 

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT. At the moment  only Freddie Mac, I believe , has a pilot program to buy these, and it’s very small. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That was my u nderstanding.  Does Fannie do any? 

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT. Not yet. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So, for all practical purposes, since private pools have gotten very large but are still somewhat  less than the sum of Fannie and Freddie, the Loanperformance data at best are large exaggerations. There’s also an interesting qu estion about the second house issue.  You’re raising the data out of the American Hous ing Survey, and the last one was for 2003, but the actual acceleration of both turnover and presum ed purchases occurs after that.  We’ve be en getting HMDA [Home Mortgage Disclosure Act] data on that for 2004, essentially  doing it by month.  In there, of course, are the mortgage originations for other than owne r-occupied residences.  One would expect that there’s a little fudging on the part of investors about what the homes are to be  used for, but if the bias is presumed to be fairly standard, we’r e going to learn something about the apparently uncontested assumption of the acceleration in turnover of existing home s and, indeed, the big increase in new home construction.  All of that will be disaggregated  into purchases for ownership, for investment, and for vacation homes. The data that we have seen—confidential da ta from individual banks—do show a rather significant pickup.  The numbers don’t get as hi gh as those from the Na tional Association of                      23 of 234Realtors—23 percent or something li ke that—but they indicate a fair ly substantial pickup.  And of the sum of second homes, a disp roportionately large number are purchased by investors; the investor share very definitely has accelerated.  This is one set of data—f or the very large banks— that does show a marked acceleratio n into 2004 and 2005.  So, I think we need to know much more about this. But let me just ask one simple question:  Do we have an y insight on the land component of those sales? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  Sir, I can addres s that a bit.  Actually, Morris  Davis, who is an economist here at the Board, has written a paper on that very subject, and—  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Was that a year or so ago? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  Just about a year ago, exactly. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I read it. MR. GALLIN. Okay. I can tell something from the tone of your  voice.  [Laughter]  In any event, the idea there was to  look at house prices and construction costs and to try to back out as a sort of mechanical oper ation—not an easy on e—the value of the land.  He shows that land prices have increased very rapidly and that the land share of the property values has gone up over time.  As you mentioned, we know somethin g about farm prices.  But beside s those two things, there really aren’t— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  As an example, th e Chicago Bank publishes quarterly data— fairly detailed data—on land prices in all the states in its District.  Does anybody else? 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Agricultural land, yes. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  Thes e are your data?  You collect them? 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. Yes, we collect the data.                24 of 234CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  So you actually have data on each individual farm.  You have a database from which one could actually construct the price changes over time to at least learn what is happening as the urban fringe moves out.  So  you have at least one di mension, which is this issue that you raise with respect to new homes and existing homes.  Has anybody tried to look at that? I ask because they are the only data that I’m aware of whic h actually show a level of land prices over a significant period of  time.  And no one us es them on the grounds that agricultural land prices have nothing to  do with residential land pric es.  But that can’t be true. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. I agree, Mr. Chairman.  Those data are being influenced in part by the expansion of residential areas out into what used to be farms or agricultural land.  There are some interesting dynamics taki ng place because, in the Chicago metrop olitan area, a lot of  this land is now being used for reside ntial purposes.  However the sellers, for tax purposes, want to use the proceeds to buy agricultural land right away.  So they then go downstate in Illinois and bid up the prices there.  They are not as concerned about th e price as long as they can make this tax-free exchange.  So, that’s one dynamic.  The other interesting dynamic, of course, is that as agricultural subsidies have increased so rapidly—they are now  about 50 percent of net farm income—there’s less concern about the valu e of land coming down. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It’s cap italized into the land price. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Clearly. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But y ou still have to pa y the agricultural subsidy to buy the land to build a house.  There’s no way to get out from under that.   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Mr. Chairman, we have, in fact, looked at farmland values and at the data that are collected by the Reserve Banks, and there has been an appreciable acceleration in farmland prices.  It varies a considerable degree  by District.  For exampl e, in areas like the San                    25 of 234Francisco District or the Richmo nd District, where the interfa ce of the urban expansion into agricultural areas probably is greater, we’ve seen a much more pronounced acceleration than, for example, in the Dallas District. As we put that all together, it is true that we don’t have  a good series broken down by regional land prices per se.  But it’s very diffic ult to believe that the acceleration we’ve seen in residential property prices doesn’t reflect to a very  significant degree an incr ease in land prices.  While it may be difficult to do Morris’s type of cal culation, we just haven’t seen anything like the acceleration in basic construction co sts that would suggest anything other than a substantial increase in land values.  And when we look ed at those farmland prices to see if there was some confirmation of that impression in the agricultural land prices, it seemed pretty clear th at we were seeing that.  Again, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the farmla nd is overvalued.  I think the same questions are open on the agricultural land prices  as they are in Dick ’s and Josh’s debate about whether or not housing is overvalued, but there has been a substantial step-up in recent years. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We do obviously have BEA [Bureau of Economic Analysis] data on transaction costs and, one would presume, profit margins, so that in a way we have at least one element of the markup over cost.  The differences  that we’re looking at here are so large that it’s not a minor question.  Indeed, if you take Dick’s bubble—or lack thereof, I should say—you get the impression that deflation is probab ly going on.  [Laughter]  I’d be curious, frankly, to have Andreas, who has looked at this to a great  extent, comment on Dick’s paper. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I thi nk Josh and Dick should have an opportunity  to talk a little more about their differences of view in this area.   

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT. Not th at I don’t have an opinion.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I th ought you’d be the ideal intermediary.  [Laughter]                26 of 234MR. PEACH. Well, le t me make just a co uple of observations.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let me stop you.  You’ve made your point.   I think you were responding to the data of your two colleagues.  Let them respond, and then you respond to them. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  Loosely speaking, what we’re trying  to do is to get a sense of changes in the price of a typical home—what has been happening to that price ove r time—adjusting for quality.  I guess I’ll start with my concerns about the constant-quality figure, and then I’ll address Dick’s concerns about the transactio ns price index that I used. One reason I worry about the constant-quality number, and Dick alluded to it, is that it’s a constant-quality price index for new homes, and new homes typically  are not built where existing homes are already situate d.  You can see that when  you drive out of any ci ty, basically.  The big developments are on  the outskirts of the citie s, and those outskirts ar e moving further out.  I recognize that cities can be multi-centered and so forth, but ne w homes—while not always built on the cheapest available land—typically are built on the cheapest available land.  And the constant-quality price index for new homes has only crude controls for location.   So I don’t think that index is able to fully handle that issue.  That’s why I like the repe at-transactions price index.  As Dick mentioned, it basically matches up addresse s over time and looks at the price changes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Have  you adjusted that for th e modernization per housing unit? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN. Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. How mu ch does that take off? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  Well, as Dick poi nted out in his briefing, ther e are data on improvements.  So I use those data and divi de that by the stock of housing and subt ract it off.  But on the other side of that argument is the fact that  while many homes get additions ma de to them, all homes are also                27 of 234deteriorating somewhat over time, wh ich will bias things in the other direction.  And we have data on that.  So, improvements are affecting price appr eciation one way, and depreciation is affecting it the other way.  Once you take both into account, the net effect is only a fe w tenths a year.  Now, these things can cumulate over time, but I use data on improveme nts and on depreciation to remove those biases from the published da ta.  So, there are problems with the published data, but we don’t have to make do with the published data. Likewise, there’s a transactions  bias.  Homes that appreciate mo re tend to transact more, and that’s going to bias upward the published price inde x that I start with.  But there are studies on the size of this transactio ns bias.  Dick provided some data on it.  I’ve taken estimates of the size of this transactions bias and removed it from the published data.  So, I st art with the pub lished data, but I make various adjustments.  One last point is that because the pr ice index is based on mortgages purchased or securitized by the GSEs, it’s going to  miss FHA and VA loans and also jumbo loans. There is a published private sect or price index put out by Case  and Shiller that actually goes to deed-level data, and they look at all home pur chases.  They do a repeat-transactions method, but they look at all purchases and throw out only refinancings and exchanges among families.  That index actually shows faster appreciation since 199 9.  That would seem to suggest that the homes with jumbo loans may be appreciating faster and that by leaving out jumbos I am perhaps biasing things down. So, my final takeaway from this  is that there’s no perfect wa y to measure house prices.  All these measures have their various flaws.  But I think that a properly adjusted repeat-transactions price index—one that uses not  just the published data but makes adjustments for the shortcomings—is a better way to get a read on what’s going on in the housing market.                    28 of 234MR. PEACH. I have just thre e comments.  First, I’m not disp uting that land prices where houses are being built would be lowe r than land prices closer to th e center of a metropolitan area.  The issue is the rate of increase of those land prices.  And we don’t really know what’s happening to the rate of increase of land prices at  different points along the continuum. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s the weighting e ffect.  As you move out, the price levels are lower, so there’s a downwa rd bias, whereas for existing ho mes that bias can’t exist. 

[SECTION]

MR. PEACH. That’s true.  Th at assumes that there is this nice gradual gradient of price change for land as one moves out from the center of a metropolitan area.  I don’t know the answer, but my observation is that that is not what occurs .  In the New York metrop olitan area, for example, I think one could cite many locations  where land prices closer to Ma nhattan, say in Newark, are not rising as rapidly as in Short H ills or in Hunter don County.  So, that re lationship probably just doesn’t hold in reality. Another thing that we’ve observed, particularly  in our metropolitan area, is that state and local governments are now aggressive bidders fo r parcels of land that are potential sites for residential development.  So it’s conceivable that  the price of land on which one could build a home now is rising extremely rapidly—and perhaps even more  rapidly than land closer in that has already been developed. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is there any agreem ent about what propor tion the land is currently—some rough order of magnitude—relative to the total value of homes sold?  For example, is land 10 percent of the sales price, on average, or 20 percent or 30 percent? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  I think it varies  substantially across locations .  I think Morris found it to have become quite high; he estimated that the number had moved up above 50 percent.                   29 of 234MR. PEACH. The average lot size  also has been declining rather rapidly, indicating that the price of land is going up rapidly. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’m not asking for the change , I’m looking for the level.  Governor Gramlich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Well, one more  question on the data.  Jos h, you need the share of land to do the price-rent ratio, don’t you?  You adjust for improvements, but surely that’s only on the structure, not on the land. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  Right. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  So the share of  land in the value is increasing.  Is that extracted from your price-rent ratio in some way? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN. Yes. What yo u do is get the depreciation ra te, and that’s relative to the structure.  It actually doesn’t make too much of a difference exactly how you do  it.  But, again, I got land share numbers from Morris Davis, and one  can basically tamp it  down year by year. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Okay. Then it’s also a ratio.  And the CPI tenant rent measure is for a constant unit over time.  So what you try to do is to normalize on that? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  Yes. My price series and my rent series are both indexes to start with, so they are unit-less.  Again, leanin g on my colleague, Morris, we get a base-year estimate of rents for a constant-quality unit. We ge t the base-year dollar price and then multiply by that. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Okay. John, I have one qu estion for you.  How do we interpret the optimal policy?  We, the policymaker s, know all the shocks .  So when we move  the funds rate on the red line, is that to be inte rpreted as acting in ad vance of the house-price change, simultaneously with the house-price change, or what?                      30 of 234MR. WILLIAMS.  In the optima l policy simulations, from the beginning of the simulations, which is the third quarter of this year, you know the entire future  path of house prices and any other shocks that I add.  So you are acting in anticipation of those fu ture price changes. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  So if we see house prices going up, we’re in effect cutting the funds rate while the house prices are going up? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILLIAMS.  That’s correct.  That’s why I was trying to compare it with the Taylor rule—which doesn’t have that aspect of respondi ng to developments as they unfold—to see how well that would do. 

[SECTION]

MR. PEACH. I wanted to make one other point with regard to Josh’s work, and that is that using the tenant rent component of the CPI an d comparing it with the OFHEO index is, in my opinion, a real apples-to-oranges type of compar ison.  As I pointed ou t in my comments, the OFHEO index measures  what is happening around the 75th percentile of th e distribution of single-family homes where we know income s are rising more rapidly.  Usin g a rent component that on the one hand is looking at what is going on in the multi -family housing market  to a large extent— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Actually, it’s based on single-family homes which are rented but have the characteristic that they could be sold. 

[SECTION]

MR. PEACH. Not in the tenant  rent component he is using. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The rent componen t I presume we’re using is the owners’ equivalent rent, are we not? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN. Actually, it’s no t.  But it doesn’t make any di fference.  [Laughter]  I could easily have done it with the owners’ equivalent rent , but I would have had to cut off all my pictures in 1983 because that’s when that series begins.  I went with the tenant rent strictly for the length of                31 of 234the time series.  But if you  look at the relative leve ls of these two series over time, while the growth rates do differ a little bit, you’re  talking about really small potatoes—on the order of 2 percent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If you keep getti ng a significant rise in home ownership— meaning a shifting of ex isting families from rent  only—you are going to bias that ratio. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  Absolutely.  As an aside, bu t regarding that particular point, I’ve been working one day a week at the Bure au of Labor Statistics, and I ha ve access to the confidential underlying micro data that they use to build up the CPI.  So, some of my  work is trying to get at just these types of criticisms .  But from the underl ying data, I have be en able to look at  rent appreciation for different segments of  the rental market, trying to see—with home ownership rates going up— where the homeowner market is steal ing, so to speak, from the rental market and how big the biases are. And it does look as  if the higher end of the rental mark et has been showin g somewhat smaller rent increases over time, suggesting that that’s where it’s coming from, but not dramatically. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That raises an important point because, as we know, wages of nonsupervisory workers, whic h are essentially payroll data, are going up 3 percent, whereas implicitly that of supervisory workers is going up double or three times that.  That’s changing; it has accelerated in the most recent period. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  Let me note just one last thing.   The pictures are going to look the same as those Dick showed, whether we look at house prices relative to income or to rent.  So, even if the rent series might have this problem or that problem—and it does have prob lems—house prices have grown quite dramatically using the adjusted da ta that I used relativ e to incomes as well. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. MR. FERGUSON.  I guess my qu estion is addressed to Gle nn and John.  Ob viously, the United States is unique, but we’re not the only coun try where a central bank has been trying to deal                32 of 234with this issue.  We’ve seen r ecently that monetary authorities in the United Kingdom, Australia, and perhaps the Netherlands  are all talking about th e possibility of us ing monetary policy to try to deal with the house-price issue.  So, what, if any, lesson can we learn from overse as?  I recognize that our particular situation is unique, but we ’re not the only ones dealing with this problem. 

[SECTION]

MR. RUDEBUSCH. That’s an  interesting question.  I thin k one of the points to be considered is that thos e countries are all sma ller than the United Stat es, and typically their residential property markets are centered in one or two cities—London or Sydne y, for example.  So perhaps that’s a factor that just looms larger in the policy calculation.  And that may be the reason why the central bankers in those countries have been perhaps a little  more proactive,  although that issue is still being worked  out, I think.  They have done a bit more jawboning, so to  speak.  But Australia, in particul ar, has been a little  more explicit about fact oring in housing market developments in the policy calculation.  Again, th ey don’t target house pr ices, but they certainly seem to take them into account a bit more than the Unites States does, in terms of setting monetary policy. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. But ha ve the results, generally speaking,  been positive or  neutral?  I know this policy is in it s early days, but is there any judgment one could make even at this early stage on whether or not more ja wboning—or, in the cas e of Australia, actually moving rates—has been helpful? 

[SECTION]

MR. RUDEBUSCH. I think both Australia and the United Kingdom, to the extent they have conducted this type of policy, have felt it was fairly successful.  They have been able to temper home price appreciation and restore some ba lance in the economy without any significant macroeconomic fallout.  They have had lower home price appreciation but, again, their situations are perhaps very different from th e situation for the United States.               33 of 234 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I’d like to comment also on the policy discussion.  It se ems to me that to do this analysis correctly, the central bank really has to  think about intervening mo re or less all the time because, if you have a one-off po licy response and you promise that you’re never ever going to do it again, it perhaps would not be all that useful.  So it seems to me  that policymakers would need to think about routinely having asset prices be a consideration in policy analysis. I think that would be a terribl e idea, and let me explain why.   Let’s look at it from an optimal control point of view and suppose hypothetically that we have a po licy instrument that is absolutely ideal. It has no side effects, is completely indepe ndent of the federal funds rate, or the macro policy instrument, and has pe rfectly predictable effects.  Th at’s the ideal from a control-theoretic point of vi ew.  In that case, if the central bank were adjusting such an instrument and setting capital values, it se ems to me that that would change th e whole nature of the pricing mechanism in asset markets.  And I think it would be  a terrible idea in a ma rket economy to have a government agency setting capital as set values.  That’s wh y I would not start to go down this route; I believe it is really a dead-end. 

[SECTION]

MR. RUDEBUSCH. I guess I’d make a distinct ion there, in that I think the proponents are talking not about setting asset prices in genera l but about trying perhap s to reduce the bubble component.  Clearly, if asset prices are set equal to the fundamenta ls, that’s going to lead to the proper functioning of— 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. But the point is that there coul d be a little bubble comp onent or a big bubble component.  Obviously, policymak ers wouldn’t apply the instrument  when prices ar e regarded as reflecting the fundamentals, but the instrument woul d be continuously available.  The whole point of such an instrument would be to keep the price right at the fu ndamentals.  But then that would                  34 of 234change the whole nature of asse t pricing in a market  economy.  I think a proper policy analysis really can’t be done on a one-off ba sis in cases such as the stock mark et in the ’90s or house prices today. 

[SECTION]

MR. RUDEBUSCH. I’m sympat hetic to that view.  It se ems as if there might be a threshold.  That is, policymakers might be more inte rested in certain asset markets or might be more interested in prices in asset markets in general at certain time s.  But I think you ’re alluding to the moral hazard or political  complications that could arise from this type of intervention or from trying to use this bubble com ponent as a monetary tr ansmission mechanism. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Essentially, it’s th e same problem that arises wi th wage and price controls.  Having that as a policy instrument that is so metimes used and sometimes not used completely changes the pricing mechanism in a market economy.  I think that problem applies in spades to stock prices, equity prices, and bond prices.  W ith house prices I think the problem is a little different, but I believe the sa me basic principle applies. 

[SECTION]

MR. RUDEBUSCH. People also have made the argument that if policymakers are going to clean up the mess after the fact, there may be other problems.  If you let equity pr ices rise on the upside but then essentially make some sort of insu rance agreement on the do wnside, that again is a distortion—though perhaps an asymmetric one—that may also have complications. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. There’s ample ro om, I think, for un derstanding the housing market within what you phrased as the standard policy.  But I think going after asset prices direc tly is something very different.  That’s the poi nt that I’m trying to make. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just wanted to make a couple of comments and also ask a quick questio n.  My first comment rela tes to the run-up in pric e-rent ratios that we’ve             35 of 234seen. It seems to me th at there might be a couple of factors th at could explain at least some portion of the run-up, though probably not all of it, that were n’t mentioned in the presentations. First, it seems to me that financial innovations affecting housing could have improved the view of households regard ing the desirability of housing as an asset to  be held in portfolios and thus raised the equilibrium  price-to-rent relationship fo r residential real estate.  What I’m thinking of is the idea that equity held in reside ntial real estate is a lot more accessible today than it has been in the past.  Home equity credit at co mmercial banks is up fourfold since 1999, and many households obviously are now keenly aware that refinancing provides a low-cost avenue  for tapping into the equity in their homes.  So, in a sense, there might be less of a liquidity pr emium embodied in the return for housing.  Also, if peop le feel that the liquidity constraints in holdin g housing as an asset are diminishing, that could expl ain a reduced need for precaution ary saving in traditional liquid assets. It could even make people willing to put more of their wealth in to down payments on houses and may have raised pri ces through that mechanism. The other thing that occurred to me is that there might be effects fr om tax changes.  We’ve had changes in the rules for tax ex emption and in 1997 on capital gains from the sa le of primary residences that would make holding real estate as sets more attractive.  An d the changes in capital gains taxes more generally in 19 97 and then again in 2003 would have worked in the same direction. One of the things that  we looked at that we thought was interesting was the behavior of price-rent ratios for residential housing and for co mmercial office space.  Commercial office space price-rent ratios are highly cyclical—I guess th ey always have been—but  it appears that the behavior of price-rent ratios in residential ho using has closely mirrored what we’ve seen in commercial office space.  The ra tios for both have gone up about 30 to 35 percent since around            36 of 2341998, though the dy namics are totally different.  Commercial office space rents have been falling— it’s not that the prices have been rising—but the price-rent ratios have moved very similarly. A second comment I wanted to  make concerns the relationship of creative finance to the housing market.  One view that I think is very pr evalent is that the use of  credit in th e form of piggyback loans, interest-only mortgages, option ARMs [adjustable-rate mortgages], and so forth, involves financial innovations that  are feeding a kind of unsustainab le bubble.  But an alternative perspective on that is that high house prices, in fact, are curtaili ng effective demand for housing at this point and that house appreciatio n probably is poised to slow.  So the incr easing use of creative financing could be a sign of the fi nal gasps of house-price apprecia tion at the pace we’ve seen and an indication that a slowing is at hand.  Previousl y, lenders applied very rigid constraints on loan-to­value  ratios, but essentially those constraints ar e now being eased at the margin through these creative financing techniques.  And that’s providing some elasticity to what was a firm roof.  It may slightly diminish th e price elasticity of the dema nd for housing, but the fact  that it is blossoming now basically suggests that we really are at the ceiling where it ’s binding and w ill ultimately constrain appreciation. Finally, with those two commen ts, a question.  It concerns the presentation by Andreas and the numbers cited on loan-to-valu e ratios at originatio n.  One of the thin gs we’re seeing in California and elsewhere in our District—and maybe this is true  nationwide—is a growing use of piggyback loans. Loan-to-value ratios of 90 to 95 percent are common in California, and we’ve even seen combination loan-to-va lue ratios and piggyback loans going up to 125  percent.  I guess that means two things, one of which is that the traditional first mortgage lo oks utterly conventional. Those mortgages have an 80 percent loan-to-value ratio and I suppose they are being sold off to Fannie and Freddie.  The other thing is that with such  conventional mortgages being sold to Fannie                   37 of 234and Freddie, there’s no need for private mortgage insurance.  So Fannie’s and Freddie’s books may look better in some sense—less ri sky—than they really are because of all of the second mortgages going up to possibly 125 percent. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It so unds like a CDO [collateralized  debt obligation].  That’s what it is, isn’t it?  

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Yes. So I wondered if that was somethin g that you’re aware of and something that is included in the numbers. 

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT.  Yes.  The data that you see on my first exhib it in principle include second liens, closed-end second liens.  An d in particular in the graph that you cite I use the newly available 2004 data from HMDA which for the first time ha s collected data on whether or not the HMDA loan is a junior or a fi rst lien.  So the picture that you s ee there should reflect the growth of piggyback loans. CHAI

[SECTION]

RMAN GREENSPAN.  Could I just ask a qu ick question?  Do we have data on price­to-rent  ratios of apartment dwellings?   We do have data on prices of  apartments, and we have rent.  I think Dick raised a very intere sting question about the numerator and the denom inator.  The way to square that is to get the same data for the same type  of unit.  Do we have that information and what does it show? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  We do have thos e data.  There’s an index that gives price per square foot and rent per square foot  for apartments na tionally and in various citi es.  And it sh ows a marked increase in the price-rent ratio. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do es it look like the ones that you were showing? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  It doesn’t go back as far—it only goes back to 1986 —but since 1996, yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay.                      38 of 234MR. GALLIN.  It’s quite a steep increase. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is the level the same, can you tell? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  These apartment pr ice data and rent data are by  square footage.  I guess I could make a calculation, but I don’t have those data here. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It’s worthwhile looking  at that.  Sorry about the interruption.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON. I have a couple of questions.  First of all, co ncerning the scen ario of a 20 percent decline in housing prices: Is that weighted to any extent?  Is it weighted so that it would reduce the froth or the increased valuation that had occurred up to a certain point?  Or would that simply take the total amount of value and reduce that number by 20 percent? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILLIAMS.  All I’m doin g is the latter—reducing the overall housing wealth by 20 percent relative to the base. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON. With Josh’s  20 percent, I assume that there is  an implicit wei ghting, is there not? Would the 20 percent increase in value reflec t to some extent the greater run-up in value in areas like California where there are large numbers of properties that have increased significantly more in value than others? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  It’s basically  a value-weighted measure. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON. Yours is.  But is it the aggregate divided by th e number of housing units?  I would think that there would have to  be an implicit weighting in your calculation.  If, in fact, the increases that had occurred, would that have affected to any extent the risk exposure? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILLIAMS.  In terms of the FRB/US mo del, the only way that house prices and housing wealth enter is through the aggregate.                39 of 234MR. OLSON. I see. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILLIAMS.  So, one of the shortcomings, even of a model with se veral hundred equations, is that it doesn’t have the distribution effects. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON. There are two part s to that.  One is the overal l impact on the model.  The second is that, to the extent there is risk embedded in the underlying mortgages, it would tend to be where the run-up has b een higher.  I’m goin g to talk a little bit about that tomorrow. My second point is on land value.  In the assessed valuation that I ge t from the county—I’ve been too frightened in recent years to look at it—doesn’t it break out the land value and the improvements?  I assume that’s pub lic knowledge, is it not?  So, presumably, you could access that number. And my recollec tion is that for residential appraisa ls three different methodologies are used, one of which looks at  the improvements vis-à-vi s the land value.  So I would guess that that information is available. My third point is just a visual observation, ha ving to do with the inci dence of teardowns in a improvements, you see an increase in the teardowns.   Locally, that trend st arted in D.C. and it has now moved out into our neighborho od.  So that is a critical component, it seems to me, of any buying decision.  And I think those data would be available. I have one follow-up question on something the Chairman mentioned.   Somebody suggested to me recently—I just heard a different figure on  this—that the private p ools of mortgage-backed loans are now larger than the GSE pools.  Have you seen any recent data to that effect? 

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT. Not in the United States.  I don’t know  what country or planet— [laughter]              40 of 234MR. OLSON.  The planet was Earth.  [Laughte r]  The country was th e United States.  And the person making the observation was talking about sales of the no nconforming product into what they see as a growing and undisciplined secondary market. 

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT. I’m sorry, I shouldn ’t have said that.  Do you mean the flow or the stock? 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON. Well, that’s a good question.  I think the st atement was as to the flow. 

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT. Then I beg your pardon.  Of course, the stock differences are enormous.  As for the flow difference, on ne t, GSE guaranteed mortgages in both  pools and to a small extent on the balance sheet hardly grew at all in 2004, while it was an e xplosive year for growth for the RMBS sector. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON. That’s true.  Th at’s a good point.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher.

MR. FISHER.  Following up on Governor Fe rguson’s question, I would imagine that one of the differences here is that we have tremendous variations from market to market.  And to the Chairman’s question about the propor tion of housing prices attributab le to the land value, I would assume that it has to do with local regulation and re strictions on land use.  For example, if you look at the numbers for homes bein g considered or under permit for construction in Southern California—that includes Los Angeles, Ventura,  and Orange County—in the ’80s it was in the 100,000 plus range. This year it’s 37,000, in part because of the impos ition of highly restrictive regulations on land use.  If you look at permit s for current construction of  single-family homes in North Carolina, where there are almost no restrictions whatsoever, it’s over 50,000. So, the question is: Can you assume that land  price as a percentage of house price is a function of regulatory and other restrictions imposed  on land use and on co nstruction?  Is there a way to measure this?  I ask because it strikes me—a nd I’ve been thinking about other countries as                41 of 234well, and Spain is an in teresting example—that monetary policy would be a very blunt general tool if, indeed, there are significant va riations city by city, state by  state, and market by market. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  I’ll leave the m onetary policy aspect to my co lleagues.  But let me make a couple of points about land us e restriction.  Certainly, land use restrictions, environmental restrictions, and those types of things have played a role in the rapid rise in house prices.  That certainly is a factor.  I me ntioned in my briefing that  I like to compare house prices to rent—and this is one of the reasons—as opposed to comparing them to incomes.  If increased regulation boosts house prices, people are just going to have to pay more out of their income for housing because of the regulations put in place.   But land use restrictions should affe ct rents as well.  So, it should drive up the cost of buying a home, and it should also drive up  the cost of renting a home.  It can be a significant factor, but it should be  in both of those elements. And this is somewhat of an aside, but I find it in teresting.  I talk to a lo t of builders as part of my day-to-day work here, and I’ve asked them about th is very issue.  They sa y definitely that land use restriction is a big concern for them.  But I also went back and looked at newspaper articles written in ’86, ’87,  ’88, and ’89, and it’s truly remarkable how the view back then was that housing prices could never fall because, as people were sa ying left and right, there was no more buildable land left due to environmental regulations and land us e restrictions.  They were saying that right up to 1989 when house prices levele d out in nominal terms.  I’m not saying these things aren’t real— the builders say they are real—but they’re certa inly not new though they may be new in their effects.  But just to get back to the point, I thin k they should be captured in the price and the rent data. 

[SECTION]

MR. PEACH. Just one follow-up comment.  Th ere’s a lot of evidence  to suggest that a good part of the reason for the ra pid rise in home prices in Cali fornia, Washington, D.C., and along                   42 of 234the East Coast, for exam ple, is because of relatively inelas tic supply—not that demand there is necessarily stronger.  That’s pretty clear in the data .  Whether it’s due to these land use restrictions or other factors, the fact is that these are already fairly densely p opulated areas and there’s definitely a more inelastic supply in these areas of the country. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I would imagine that it would be  driven also by the kind  of margins that the suppliers can capture.  Just for verisimilitude, I talked to Hovnanian, who builds about 20,000 homes a year at roughly $300,000 apiece.  His ma rgins are being squeezed in California, but in these less restrictive areas he can capture a greater amount, so obvio usly he gravitates to where he can capture the greatest margin.  Now that’s just one example, but common sense would suggest that it applies more broadly. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The ar gument for the rapid rise in  land prices in 1837 was that land was fixed in quantity .  [Laughter]  So, new ideas are very rare.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I remember th at bubble!  [Laugh ter]  I have two questions. My first is fo r John Williams or perhaps for Dave Stockton.  Wh at is the right way to think about dealing with uncertainty in considerin g the policy question?  Put aside Glenn’s question about whether you know a nything ever about the relationship be tween prices and fundamentals at a given point.  What if what  you don’t know is simply the likely path of home prices going forward? You could take the group here ar ound the table and assume some path, but there woul d be a fairly fat band of uncertain ty around that path.  What  does your regime imply, John, for policy in that particular circumstance?  Do you basically ignore hou sing prices and look at all the other things we look at? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILLIAMS.  I think that the Greenbook forecas t, as I understand it—and maybe Dave should talk about this—is predicated on a particular assumptio n about the future path of housing                      43 of 234prices and takes into account the kind of models th at Josh was discussing.  The staff looks at all the empirical evidence, just as they  do for every equation on every aspect of the economy.  So, monetary theory would tell you to  come up with the best, most reasonable forecast and adopt a policy that is appropriate to that  path but also consid er, as you’re saying, all the risks and the distribution of the risks.  It’s al ong the lines of some of  the charts in the Gr eenbook, which show the distribution of risks and then contemplate the impli cations for the current se t of policy options over that distribution of risks.  I think the basic idea in  the economic literature is  that you first want to  get a very reasonable path, and that would be more or le ss your baseline.  It’s not a path , I should say, that just keeps housing prices constant or keeps any asset price co nstant.  It should be the best forecast of these asset prices that you can come up with, but subject, of course, to the fact that these are very hard to predict.  

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  And you wait an d see and then adjust course based on developments as they unfold. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILLIAMS.  That woul d be the standard policy. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Just on that point, isn’t that the difference between the optimal policy and the Taylor rule? With the Taylor rule, you wa it and see.  In the optimal policy, you somehow know this so you can move earlier. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILLIAMS.  Right.  The Taylor rule woul d just be one example, of course, of a policy that takes into account the informat ion you have up to that  point.  It’s not opti mal in some sense.  It’s just a simple equation.  It  does represent this wait-and-see approach.  I was using the optimal policy to illustrate what you would do if you kn ew everything.  It’s kind of a comparison.                 44 of 234MR. REINHART. John can co rrect me if I’m wr ong, but I think ther e is an important element to your question about what is the source of uncertainty.  If the so urce of uncertainty is going to be the evolution of  house prices, that basically is uncerta inty of a linear type that’s affecting aggregate demand.  So you take yo ur best shot and, therefore, set policy accordingly.  The other possibility is that  you’re not certain how house prices will react  as you change yo ur instrument.  That becomes multiplier uncertainty; and depending on the structure of the uncertainty in your model, you may either attenuate or not. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  My second qu estion is about policy,  but not monetary policy.  Glenn, in your not e, you allude to other instruments if  monetary policy doesn’t seem to be the appropriate tool to address a concern about lower value prices .  What do we know about the history of the use of the supervisory tool in past  periods of concern about real estate bubbles or imprudent lending?  Do we have a rich history on the use of those inst ruments that tells us something about the effi cacy or about our foresi ght in deploying them? 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. It’s called the real bills doctrine. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Since the bills doctrine.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. RUDEBUSCH. Since you’re  going to the British Embassy,  I might note that in the United Kingdom they used  to allow loan-to-value at origination of 120 pe rcent.  You could buy your property under water essentially by 20 percent.  One of the recent restrictions they’ve imposed is a limit of 110 percent.  So this time around th ey feel much better in th e U.K about where they are with just 110 percent loan-to-value at origination.  But the monetary authority there doesn’t have supervisory responsibility— 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I meant in our hist ory.  In our history, have we used that tool to good or ill effect?  Have we  used it wisely an d with foresight?                    45 of 234CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You’re bi asing the answer.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. The answer is obviously “yes.”  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. My understanding is that we’ve used it fairly often in the postwar period, in the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s—i n early 1980, for example.   My understanding is that it hasn’t worked very well.  There have been times when we’ve tr ied to jawbone the banking system’s allocation of credit. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Is the history one of  using it too late, or of using it and its having no effect because there are other ways to get money? 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  May I say something here?  I don’t have any qua ntitative studies on this, but based on talking to the folks who lived through it, I’ d make a couple of observa tions.  If we look at the 1980s—the most recent housin g bubble that was nationwide.  We saw the bubble bursting nationally as opposed to the po ckets we’ve had with the California breakdown or the Boston breakdown, which really relate d to the local economies and lo cal employment developments.  I think the local economic  employment situations were the dr ivers of delinquencies, and the regulators generally missed that because they missed the local econo mic impact.  And I think people focus on the fact that th ose cycles were driven by  local economic conditions. I think the period of the 1980s involved a broader failure on the part of supervis ors.  If we compare the 1980s experien ce with what is happen ing now, in the earlier period a lot of financial institutions were on an exam cycle that went five or six year s.  So, nobody on th e supervisory side was in there looking at wh at was going on.  And th at period was before th e time when securitization became a prevalent practice, so most of the risk wa s carried on the books of the banks.  Also, many of the banks that were hit very badly were follo wing developers—going out of their footprint and lending on properties that they di dn’t know.  And I thin k one of the risks we have today in our big            46 of 234banks is that while we sa y they are diversified ge ographically, many of their loans are to investors or purchasers of second-home resort properties.  So, the lenders again are following their customers out of the local area, and in the location of the new property the local lenders aren’t looking at it; the customer’s lender is hand ling the transaction.  So, we still may have that ri sk embedded within the financial institutions.  It’s one of the things  we’re focusing on. What is new about it this time, though, is that a lot of  these nonconforming products are being securitized by the private se ctor.  So the real question is: Wh ere does the market discipline kick in?  And as supervisors, can we fault an institution for responding to a ma rket need when it is offloading the loans and the risk into these type s of mortgage structures that Andreas has been describing?  We clearly could if the financial inst itutions were buying the equity or mezzanine risk tranches and the risks were  back on the institutions’ books.  But in many cases that clearly isn’t what is happening.  So, we  have some different asp ects this time around.   Just to let everybody know, the OCC [Office of the Comptrol ler of the Currency] and the Fed currently are putting together a horizontal review to look at the fringe kind of lending activities where we do need to se nd some signals.  We wrote the H ELOC [home equity line of credit] guidance that came out last month. We’re working on this other one and hope to have it out in a couple of months.  We don’t want to turn off safe loans or the traditional types of lending activities, but we need to figure out where to  go on some of these practices th at are on the fringes.  But we haven’t done a sterling job.  I thin k that’s why we’re trying to send out some guidance .  We sent out the appraisal guidance a year or so  ago.  But some of the risky practic es of the past are starting to be repeated, and it may be that the generation of le nders now didn’t live thro ugh the problems before. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Sh all we break for coffee?  [Coffee break]               47 of 234CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted  to make a few comments and then ask a question.  First, I’d say that with all of the concerns about froth in housing markets, I found these presentations to  be very informative, and I want to congratulate the people who spent a lot of time preparing them.  I thought they were all very good presen tations.  But I also found the information comforting.  We’ve all talked about the possibility of local housin g bubbles and regional housing bubbles, and clear ly there are some in the United  States.  But we  never really looked at it on a national basis before.  The net resu lt for me was that I come away from the analysis not feeling any worse th an I did before and probably a little better. First, I thought it was very helpful to see quantified—I th ink this was in Josh’s memo—the size of the potential bubble.  He talked about a 20 percent drop in  housing prices.  But that was equal to only about 30 per cent of GDP as compared to the drop in equity prices we had, which was more than twice that.  Also, I had the feeling that  appropriate monetary polic y, as John said, could mitigate much of the distress that might occur.  Moreover, the credit risk  associated with home mortgages seems to be spread out ac ross many institutions.  Governor Bies said th at a lot of analysis is being done now, and we’ll want  to see the results of the an alysis that the Board and the Comptroller are doing.  But on the whole, th e financial institutio ns seem to be in pretty good shape. The role of securitizing mortgages is to lay off risks to parties who are willing and able to bear the risks. Capital levels of the financial institutions are rela tively high, so it app ears that these markets are performing their roles well.  And in the event of a sharp drop in housing prices, the odds of a spillover to financial institutions seem limited.  And as I mentione d, it was helpfu l to hear the suggestion that monetary policy can be effective in responding to a sharp drop—if there is one—in              48 of 234housing prices.  So I come away  somewhat less concerned about the size and cons equences of a housing bubble th an I was before. The question I had relates to what Governor Yellen was aski ng about—financial innovation. I was going to make a similar point.  The fact is  that there has been a great deal of financial innovation in housing markets in the United States.  The average pe rson can borrow very easily on his home these days.  And I was wondering if there have been—or if it is possible to do—any international comparisons on this.  I wondered whether the price-rent  ratios in other countries that 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Well, I trust you did receive or  are aware of the back ground document we circulated on the foreign experience. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. Yes. MS. JOHNSON. We didn’t do pr ice-rent ratios, and given what Jo sh has described in terms of the care he has to put in before he feels he has something close to the right number, I think we might feel a little hesita nt to do so.  I take it ba ck; there are price-rent ratios—[laughter] in the back portion of that paper.  What data we have, we us ed.  But there are huge variations in the financing practices in housing markets acros s foreign countries.  There is so me degree of securitization but less than here.  Practices with respect to the tax-favored treatment of borrowing to finance houses differ relative to those in  the United States.  There’s a host of different char acteristics, in terms of variable-rate, fixed-rate, and other types of instruments used in various foreign countries. But one of the things our paper was intended to point out was the prevalence of really rapid rises in house prices.  According to this chart—the first few pages of whic h are right here anyway— that shows through to an in crease in the price-rent ra tios as well.  So, I refer y ou back to this paper.                     49 of 234There is only a subset of the countries we covered for which we have  price-rent charts, but there are some in the paper. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  But you can’t re ally associate it with the de gree of financial innovation that we’ve had in th e United States because of this great variabi lity?  Is that what  you’re saying, Karen? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I guess I wouldn ’t necessarily associate it with, say, the development of the secondary market or the ease of equity extracti on, and those sorts of things, but I’m not saying they’re irrelevant.  For example, in this chart, Switzerland—which is a count ry that I think of as having made little  progress in that regard—doe sn’t have much of  a price-rent rati o increase.  And the U.K., which does have a more market -oriented approach, has a huge one. But it’s also true that  that’s where the price differences have been.  I thin k we’d be hard-pressed to link too tightly the increased liquidity th at we ascribe to U.S. hom e equity as now having taken on the role of the single driving factor anywa y.  It might be relevant, but I don’t know that it distinguishes these countries. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also want to  thank the authors of the papers—the international paper as well as all of the papers that were talked about today—because I found them very helpful and reassuring, along th e lines that Michael Moskow was discussing.  I also thought that Janet’s comments on the financial innovations were insightful.  Despite the fact that it’s hard to sort out the U.S. experience vis- à-vis other countries, the whole point of this—to me anyway—is that we’re seeing a ph enomenon in the hous ing markets.  So th e question is: Do the fundamentals explain it or don’t th ey?  And financial inno vations are certainly part of the mix, in        50 of 234terms of changes in the fundamentals .  So, to the extent that they’v e made many of the transactions in the housing market easier to do, that has to ha ve had some impact on the underlying asset prices. So I thought that argument was a very interesting one, and it will be interesting to see if there is any way one can tease out the effects of that. My second point is  that when you look at the relationship betw een rising prices  on either the OFHEO or the constant-quality index against disposable income as  opposed to median household income, you see an even more reassuring chart.  And I would think there’s at least a little bit of logic to doing that, based on Dick Peach’s chart about th e differences in hous e-price acceleration depending on income—with the valu e of higher-priced houses moving  up faster than lower-priced houses.  So I would think that there is some logic to look ing at this with  disposable income.  I know that you have done those charts.  I think we have  every chart you could do!  [Laughter]  But it is interesting that one sees in th at perspective somewhat less ac celeration and a somewhat more reassuring picture. Finally, and this is more of a question, we talked about a 20 percent decline in house prices and what that would do in  terms of the basic macr oeconomic effects of it.  But, of course, that wouldn’t happen overnight.   Something would make it happen.  And, as we consider our current policy stance, one of the conundru ms—though I hate to use that word—is why haven’t the 10-year yield and, therefore, mortgage interest rates, taken the same upward path as rates at the short end of the curve.  So a question  I was asking myself—and I think it’s pr obably not so difficult to figure this out—was where the point is , as mortgage rates star t to go up, when we lo ok at that affordability curve and start to worry about households beginning to  get into trouble.  Th at would then have an impact on house prices.  Obviously, higher interest rates would tend to  level house prices off or take them down. They al so would have an impact, other things equal, on pe ople’s ability to  afford the                   51 of 234house that they’re in.  How far do interest rates have to go up be fore that affordabil ity curve starts to move in the direction that caus es a problem in that regard? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN. If you look at the housing affordability pict ure—basically relating house prices and interest rates and in come—it has been moving  around in a fairly stable and favorable area for the last, say, 8 to 10 years. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Right. MR. GALLIN.  As you know, mortgage rate s have been moving up and down but on balance they have flattened out a bit over the past fe w years, if you co mpare, say, 2003  to now.  So what has been happening over that time period is th at affordability is edging  down to the lower end of the range in which it has fluctuated for a while.  There’s not hing scary about it , but affordability has been moving down. Ce rtainly, we can take  this argument  a little further.  If mortgage rates stay pretty stable and disposab le income keeps rising at  reasonable rates, affordability is going to start looking worse and worse if we ke ep getting the house-pric e gains that we’ve b een seeing.  That’s not necessarily an argument for overvaluation or under valuation.  But it is an argument for the view that the recent increases in house- price gains are not sustainable.  If rates flatten out, affordability will start to deteriorat e fairly significantly. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  If rates flatten out or if they rise? MR. GALLIN. If rates flatte n out; that’s because we would not be getting a kick any more from lower rates.  House prices can go up and housin g remains affordable if rates are lower.  But if they flatten out and stay flat, one might think that it’s going to be hard for house-price gains to keep humming along the way they ’ve been going.  That ’s going to start to eat into affordability. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Okay. I guess I was coming at it the other way. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  I’m sorry, then.                   52 of 234MS. MINEHAN.  No, no. Let me just th ink about that for a while.  Go on. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Let me make one other point on the reas ons why there may have been an increase in the equ ilibrium price-rent ratio,  because I certainly agre e with you an d President Yellen that there are some good reasons.  Thos e reasons could well incl ude financial innovation, changes in capital gains taxation, and supply constraints.  However, lots of asset price misalignments start out w ith situations where there are good reasons why those prices are rising rapidly.  Productivity innovati on and changes in busi ness models, and so forth, were I think probably valid explanations for the increase in  stock market prices, but that doesn’t mean— 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Right. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  While they we re probably valid explanations for the stock market rise in the ’90s, they didn’t necessarily, in the end, go all the way to explaining how far those valuations had moved, even if they ha d somewhat of a solid econo mic impetus to begin with. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I was thinking primarily ab out the affordability issue.  I know the affordability ratio invol ves at least three thin gs moving simultaneously—the value of houses, disposable income, and intere st rates.  I was more or  less looking just at the interest rate component. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Okay. MS. MINEHAN. I was wo ndering if interest ra tes were moving up instead of not moving up how that affects affordability. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  It’s going to make housing significantly— 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Well, yes, but where is the breaking point? If the 10-year rate goes up 1 percentage point, say, are we going to get worried about whether people can afford th eir houses?  Or is there some range over wh ich the rate can ri se and we shouldn’t be concerned?                 53 of 234MR. GALLIN.  I certainly wouldn’t want to sa y the breaking point is here or there.  But again, going back to some of the conversations I’ve  had with homebuilders, fo r what it’s worth, they indicate that they’re not going to be too worried  unless we see an increa se—and one that occurs fast—on the order of  100 basis points. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  So 1 percentage point, or 100 basis points, in a short amount of time— 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN. Yes, but that’s based just on talking to some  builders, as opposed to any firm statistical analysis.  So I would be very cautious.  I would cer tainly hesitate to draw a firm conclusion about a particular increase being a tipping point or a breaking point. 

[SECTION]

MR. PEACH. If I could just ad d a point:  In the sp ring of ’87, we had a very rapid increase in rates—200 basis poin ts—as we did again in 1994, and the housing market proved to be surprisingly resilient in  the face of those fa irly steep increases. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  I have three questio ns.  The first one is on the price-to-rent ratio.  We’ve been treating it as if mo st of the adjustment has come on prices.  And I wanted to ask Josh particularly whether, as you’ve been looking at the micro data and thinking about this, the dynamics of some of these innovations that have le d to a shift from renting to home ownership might have artificially depressed rents re lative to prices.  And I wondered, after that shift is over, if rents will start rising faster and close the gap that way—use  up some of that 20 percent.  My question is what yo u thought of that.  And my observation is that that woul d present a much more difficult situation for us s itting around this table.  It woul d be kind of like a supply shock because prices would be rising, inflation would be higher—and that homeowners’ equivalent rent would be rising faster—and we’d face a more difficult situation.  We pretty mu ch know what to do             54 of 234if house prices fall.  That’s a pure  demand shock.  But if rents start rising, that’s another matter.  So I wondered if you’d comment on that. And then, while I have the floor, let me ask my questions of Glenn and John.  Glenn, on the 1994 bubble analogy, I wa s surprised to see that classified as  a bubble.  I think there was some inflation scare then, but ther e was also a real rate ad justment at the sa me time.  If yo u looked at any of the surveys, I think you wouldn’t  have seen much of an increase in inflation expectations.  I agree that we had to raise real rates in  order to prevent that from happeni ng.  But that seem s to me a very different animal than equity pr ice changes or house-price change s because we are responsible for inflation.  So if we see infla tion moving, we’ve got to  do something about th at, whereas we’re not responsible for the relative prices of houses or equity and other thin gs.  So I wouldn’t have put 1994 on a list of situations we might th ink about as we’re looking at this issue of house-price gains.  It seems to me very differe nt.  I’d like to hear your comment on that. And finally, my other question for John has to do with this point about the misallocation of resources.  Doesn’t it ma tter what the state of the business cy cle is?  If we ha dn’t had so many houses built and so much consumption over th e last few years, we would have had more unemployment.  So it’s not obvious that resources have been misallo cated.  The resour ces that went into building houses, furnitu re, and cars, and so forth might have been unemployed, especially if we had raised rates more in  order to lean against the house-price increases.  If we had, surely unemployment would be higher.  So it seems to me  that it’s one thing to talk about misallocating resources between two states of full employment, but  it’s another thing to ta lk about a misallocation of resources where there would ot herwise be slack in the economy.  And the latter cas e I don’t think really is a misallocatio n of resources.  There’s no opportunity cost. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN. Did yo u want to start on rents?  That will give the others  some time to think.              55 of 234I’ve looked at the rent side of the picture.  As to this idea that perhaps prices are getting too high relative to rents, I’d argue th at they’re going to come back in line.  Now, maybe rents are going to be doing some of the correcting, as it were.  Th e work that I’ve done gi ves just a littl e hint of evidence that maybe rents do a b it of the correcting.  So, what we might see going forward is rent growth slightly higher than it otherwise would ha ve been.  But statistically  speaking, it’s basically no different from zero.  Statistically, it doesn’t look like rents do any of the correcting.  What really seems to be happening is that rents go up at some rate determined by eco nomic conditions and then prices move around them. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. You don’t see anything in the curren t situation that would differentiate it from past history in that regard.  I guess that was my question. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  I do not, certainly not with respect to the rents.  I would like to say also that I agree with the comments  that financial innovati ons could very well be a justifiable reason for house prices to be higher than us ual relative to other prices.  I do think some things are different. But I don’t see anything to suggest that we have to be worried about rental inflation and, as a result, overall inflation. 

[SECTION]

MR. RUDEBUSCH. With regard to equity pr ices and bond prices, the reason I included that comparison was to ma ke a couple of points.  For one, the co mment is often made  that we can’t second-guess financial markets or financial market par ticipants.  It seems as if that may be true for equity market participants but less true for bond market participants.  There I take “inflation scare” or “credibility gap” or “c onundrum” all to be another term for a situation in which we have an idea of where the fundamentals are an d we’re not sure what bond mark et participants are thinking. Now, it’s true that there’s a difference in that you have a clear idea about the reaction function or where monetary polic y is going and presumably can gu ide bond market participants                 56 of 234with transparency regarding your notion of fundament als.  So there is a cl ear difference between the question is: Where can we draw th e lessons?  The regional disparit y is completely different from both markets, and that’s just a separate issue. In any event, one reason behind  the housing price appreciation, pe rhaps, is that we have very low long rates.  This is a bond rate conundrum.  Perh aps the misalignment in bond prices is leading to this misalignment in housing pr ices.  So, one could perhaps make the argument that it’s the bond price experience in 1994 that may be the relevant on e for today.  I think I’ll st op there and leave it at that. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILLIAMS.  In fact, the third scenario th at I considered involved trying to emphasize that point—namely that, at least by some measures that people have come up with, there is a big difference in where bond rates are relative to standard estimates of fundamentals.  It’s actually a much bigger problem for th e economy than just the ho use-price effect directl y, at least according to the FRB/US model.  More importantly, it could be on e of the factors driving a big part of the house-price appreciation. In te rms of needing strong h ouse prices to keep the economy moving, the way I view your third question is that if it weren’t for the house-price run-up, monetary policy would need to be easier, given current economic conditions.  And I think that’s  absolutely right. One way to think about my scen arios is just to reverse the si gns, especially in scenarios 1 and 2, and think about it as this  as the positive stimulus we’ve go tten from a 20 percent appreciation of housing prices and this is the positive effect we’ve gotten from some other factors.  Especially scenario 1, I think yo u can see that way. The reason I mentioned the misallocation of res ources toward housing-related activities in my presentation is that in quite a bit of the economic academic  research about bubbles, the emphasis               57 of 234is that they actually lead to, as Glenn mentioned, a misall ocation of resources.  Therefore, these gaps between fundamental prices and actu al prices should appear in the policymaker’s objective function, in addition to inflation, output and employment.  So  there is a notion here th at that’s just another problem that you would want to balance off if you could.   Now, I’d like to emphasize in my closing remarks th at the assumption that  you could affect the bubble is very problematic.  As Josh himsel f mentioned, these relatio nships between housing prices and interest rates are just not as strong as one would think and not as strong as economic theory would suggest. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Ok ay.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Just for the hell of it, I’d like  to offer the hypothesis that property values are too low rather than too high. [Laughter]  If you believe that Treasury indexed bo nds are a good measure of the real rate of inte rest—and we were getting into this  discussion—the real rate of interest has been cut in half in the past five years.  For any asset wi th a perpetual stre am of returns, like land, the capital valu e has doubled.  Now, it may well be that the issue is with the indexed bonds and not with the housing prices.  It may be that the right way to st ate this hypothesis is instead to say that the conundrum is that there’s a disconnect between the pr ices of some of these assets. In any event, if we are going to  be in a world in which the real rate of interest  is truly much lower than it was before—if that is going to be the situation for some time to come—then it seems to me that we could expect some long-continuing appreciation of land values in particular.  Residential structures have a very long life, so they  are almost priced that way.  And let me link this analysis to the tear-dow n phenomenon that Mark Olson was talk ing about.  I’ve been told—I don’t know the data here—that houses replacing tear-dow ns may account for about 300,000 units a year,                  58 of 234which is a significant part of new building.  Maybe someon e knows the data on demolitions and replacements.  I don’t. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That’s  roughly the right number. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Okay. It ’s a significant part of total new construction.  An d I know in the community where I live—I thought this was real es tate hype when we bought our house—we were told that we had bought the land and got the house for free.  But that’s just about the case, because the houses in my area—a subdiv ision built in the 1 960s—are being torn down, and houses with 3,000 square feet are being replaced by houses with 6, 000 to 8,000 square feet on nice one-acre lots.  So the land value is significant. On this question about what is really happening to land va lues in urban areas, I don’t know whether the data are available to answer that.  I suppose a detailed look at re al estate records and tax records, if you had enough resour ces to do it, would enable you to look at properties where the houses are being torn down  and replaced with new homes.  And that would probably give you a pretty good measure of the underlying  value of the land in those areas.   In any event, when real rates of interest come down, one would expect to see increases in the value of the land relative to the structure.  So one would expect, I think, to see more teardowns.   I gather that, though it’s not a brand-new phenomenon, the scale of  it is probably much increased in recent years from 10 or 20 years ago. At any rate, I offer those observations because, if we are in a world th at is going to have much lower real rates of interest  for some time to come, one would expect to see the price-to-rent ratio go up. Maybe this line in the chart has an other 40 percent to go to get to equilibrium! [Laughter]                59 of 234MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I’ d like to propose that he buy my house in Washington, [laughter] given that confidence. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. If I’ m right, you won’t ne ed me to buy it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  I have an observation and a questi on about what has been  happening to the mix of mortgage products in the last 12 to 18 months.  In 2003, we saw refinancings peak; and then in 2004, total originations went fro m $3.8 trillion down to  $2.8 trillion.  So they dropped and are continuing to be soft this year.  But what happened during that 12- to 18-month period of time is that the number of ARMs shot up to about half of the originations.  And based on anecdotal evidence, ARMs still seem to be running at least at that pace.  Initially, with rates at re cord lows relative to those prevailing in the last 40 plus  years, it made sense that ration al consumers were locking in their mortgage rates and getting the houses they could afford. Now, we embarked a year ago today on a path of raising interest rates.  We haven’t had a comparable moveme nt at the long end, so long-term rates ar e basically about the same as they were. Why are so many more ARMs  being generated?  Is th is an affordability issue?   Is this a mortgage broker issue, where the brokers want to get a deal at any cost?  What is ha ppening?  I’ve heard some folks say, “Well, th e ARM is a way to do  the loan now, and th en we’ll turn around  and do the fixed rate next year.” 

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT. Okay, let me tr y to answer that question.  I can’t really comment on the hype mentality or the mortgage broker who uses a high pressure sales tactic.  But in 2004, for example, I believe that, of the AR Ms that were originated, less than 10 percent were traditional ARMs with a one-year reset period.  The remaini ng 90 percent were hybrid s that had a rate lock feature where the borrower is  protected from interest rate moveme nts for some period  of time.  The                60 of 234data on this are a little diffic ult to get, but it lo oks as if the median rate lock  period was five years.  If we think about people’s typical tenure in houses, five years isn’t a bad guess for how long people are going to stay in  a particular house.  A 30-year fixed- rate mortgage is, in effect, a hybrid mortgage that resets the day you m ove.  So, I think of this to some degree as a financial innovation, and one that people are le arning about through advertising or th e press or whatever .  And I believe this type of hybrid ARM probably makes sense for a lot of people who are making a decision on a mortgage loan. The other point that I’d make is that the fr action of originations that are ARMs often can overstate the role of ARMs in th e total mortgage market, because people refinance out of ARMs into fixed-rate mortgages frequent ly.  In fact, I’ve read in the Wa ll Street newsletters that some people seem to believe that  the current rate of refinancing is elevated by this flow out of ARMs into fixed-rate loans. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Well, that was going to be my next questio n.  The other part of  this is that we have these older 3-, 5-, and 7-ye ar ARMs, and 2005 is the initial wave of th e 3-year ARMs having their first bump-up in rates or being refinanced out of existence. 

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT. Right. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  And the numbers I’v e seen suggest that in the ne xt three years 60 percent of these ARMs are going to have the rate bumped up  or be refinanced.  So , as we look at the cumulative impact of this—I’m going back to the a ffordability issue—what  do we really see happening going forward in these mortgages? 

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT. Well, as you sa y, the rates are going to reset, and households will make move.  I don’t think there’s going to be a catastrophe on the average reset date that—                   61 of 234MS. BIES.  No matter how fast rates move up. 

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT. Obviously, if rates went up sharply, that could be a problem. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  You have  to think in terms of the enviro nment that we are forecasting to occur.  It’s a pretty tame interest rate environment; so it’s not one that will necessarily generate significant concerns about the costs of those rese t mortgages.  Now, obvi ously, we could be wrong in both directions.  One could imag ine a situation where th e rates rose faster.  And that’s one of the channels by which monetary policy has traction on the economy; if households  face higher rates, they would curtail their spending in response to that.  But presum ably you’d only be raising rates more rapidly because, in essence, you needed restraint on aggregate demand.  So you would welcome that result, as long as it wasn’t precipitating some big nonlinear type of even t in terms of people responding very, very sharply to that kind of change in the environment. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  The second question I have relates to the nature of the price decline risk.  If some of these AR Ms can’t be refinanced and foreclosures  actually start to occur—where financial institutions take over the property—are there any studies out there that indicate how much foreclosure volume could hit the market before it had a material impact on local house prices? 

[SECTION]

MR. LEHNERT. Not any recent studies that I’m aware of.  We proposed doing a study jointly with a private data vendor company on precisely this topic but it didn’t really go anywhere.  The question is whether foreclosure clusters can have  a pernicious kind of spillover effect.  I would say that lenders and loan servicer s aren’t unaware of this problem.  In my conversa tions with them, they’ve all said that thei r loss mitigation programs involve holding down the inventory of foreclosed properties that are on the market.  They do not want to le t them turn into this  sort of “pocket of blight”—that is the term  they used—as a result of the fore closure process.  That’s all the reassurance I can offer you.               62 of 234MS. BIES.  We’ll just have to see how they r eally are going to engineer those processes.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER. Yes.  I have ju st a couple of comments and a question.  Clearly, there are some perspectives from which hous ing prices seem to have drifted out of the usual relationship with indicators of fundamentals, and Joshua documented some of them.  But it se ems to me as if there are a lot of plausible stories one can tell about  fundamentals that would explain or rationalize housing prices.  Obviously, low interest rates have  to top the list.   Strong income growth among homeowning populations would be on the list, as would land use restrictions, which were mentioned earlier, and the recent  surge in spending on home im provement.  I found President Yellen’s suggestions intriguing.  I’d like to offe r my own, just in the sp irit of adding potential explanations here. And it’s rea lly a version of someth ing Governor Kohn obser ved, which is that housing prices are relative prices. I’ve been struck by the fact  that a collection of large me tropolitan areas increasingly dominates the national housing fi gures and that house-price appr eciation seems different across various urban regions.  It suggests to me that housing values may be affected significantly by—I don’t know exactly how to phrase this—sort of the relative microeco nomic value of agglomeration.  By that I mean the value of the amenities in a ci ty or the enhanced productivity associated with living in or near where one  works.  Now, in this age of telecommuting and th e Internet, it’s easy to deduce that the value of living in a city has declined.  But it seems plausible to  me that the value of a thick labor market might be increasingly important for certain skill specialti es.  And it also seems plausible that the strong demand for urban amenities is evident in the recent  vitality of many older                63 of 234urban cores.  So I’d be interested if any of our housing data experts have a ny information relevant to that issue.  While I have the floor, I’d like to make just an observation.  It seems to me likely that a confluence of several fund amental factors might rati onalize the current level of housing prices.  So from that point of view, it’s hard for me to see how it would be reasonable to place a great deal of certainty on the notion that housing is significantly overvalued, or that there’ s a bubble, or that it’s going to collapse really soon. I think these markets—this is  echoing President Poole’s disc ussion—are too complex.  I think our quantitative und erstanding of them is  too limited to warran t second-guessi ng market forces. And beyond that , the models that we have of bubbl es—Glenn wrote it down—are just some statistical noise added to an equation.  I don’t thin k we have any models that give us any reason to hope that we can understand how interest rate changes would affect this little random statistical term added on to thes e equations.  Having said that, housing pric es pose a dilemma for us and are going to pose challenges for us soon, I think.  Rapid appreciati ons in asset prices can make monetary policy more difficult.  They tend to be associated with tight ening labor markets.  At the same time, there is a rise in the downside risk. So, even though I’m not very far down Glenn’s decision tree, these are still issues I’m paying attention to.  It feels as if it could well occupy our attention here. But I’d be interested in your re action to this aggl omeration story. 

[SECTION]

MR. PEACH. Well, I think th ere’s something to it.  There is the view that people, particularly higher-income people, place a high value on their time.  If you don’t want to be caught in Washington, D.C., traffi c, say, you might decide to sell your  house in the subu rbs and move into               64 of 234the city and in the process drive up  land prices in D.C. , which happens to be one of the metro areas with the highest rate  of price increase. I’m not a regional specialist, but I know there are people at our Bank who are working on this issue of agglomeration benefits.  And I think th eir conclusion is that there are a lot of reasons, particularly labor market associated reasons, wh y there may be more aggl omeration benefits now than previously.  That is exactly  the opposite conclusion a lot of  people thought would be the case as we move to more telecomm uting and that sort of thing. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. That certainly  seems possible. When I lo ok at Josh’s exhibit 3 on everybody just woke up and decide d, boy, there are people in Miami who are just really terrific to be around—it’s an exciting city and fascinating pe ople live there.  [Laughter] But it’s also possible that that statistic could be an indication that people have unrealistic expectations about the rate of increase in house prices expected in Miami.  And there is certainly a lot of anecdotal evidence that in that particular city there is a lot of flipping of properties going on as well as other developments that might not be reflective of a purely equilibr ium move in house prices  or of agglomeration economies. So I’m still a little nervous abou t this.  There are a lot of good reasons why prices ought to be high relative to rents and relative to incomes.   And I think even Presid ent Poole’s suggestion that calculations on rents and interest rates.  And if yo u make a certain assumption about the growth rate of real rents going forward and the persistence of low interest rates, yo u can get figures showing further appreciation of maybe not 40 percent but rates that are pretty hi gh.  So we thin k that’s within the probability distribution.  But we’re also worried  that we’re seeing in many markets and for the                 65 of 234nation as a whole a run-up in prices  that certainly looks very unusual by historical standards.  It could very well be that this time is different and it’s all being driven by fu ndamentals.  But we don’t think you should rule out the possibility that you could be facing a period in which prices could be One point that has been made is that we obviously don’t know ho w the end will look—if there is an end.  The end could come through a long period of ju st relatively subdued growth in nominal house prices.  It wouldn’t have to be associated with a 20 percent declin e.  As we noted in the Greenbook, that is an extreme drop.  In fact, to get to John’s scenario 3, a lot of ex treme things have to happen. It take s an unusually large drop in house prices and a lot of spillover effects.  As you recall, the first scenar io was pretty tame; if you move down 50 basis points on interest rates, it offsets that.  But if you layer on top of the d ecline in house prices a big drop in consumer confidence, a big equity extractio n effect, or a much bigger wea lth effect from housing—which looks to us to be pretty  much on the edge—and throw in some covariance with a bond market event, the situation worsens substantially.  But it takes a lot to  get to a real disaster type of scenario. So even though we feel that house prices have m oved out of alignment with the fundamentals, we don’t necessarily  think the implications of that  are that you’re  going to be confronted immediately with some  large problem.  In fact, our best guess would be that the misalignment would unwind in ways that would be quite feasible fo r you to offset and insulate.  There are questions on the supervisory side.  There I don’t think the historical evidence suggests that supervisory policy has been used effe ctively to head off asset bubbles or to elegantly deflate them when th ey occur.  What you  might hope to  do is to have in place policies that will prevent the kind of spillove r effects of John’s scenario 2 so that you just have a wealth effect.  In other words, house prices might go down or soften and that will sh ow up on variou s agents’ balance          66 of 234sheets as a reduction in wealth.  One might hope that they respond accord ingly and that we won’t have the complications with intermed iation or other kinds of things that  would add to that effect.  So our story basically is that we’re worried about valuations in the housing market, but we don’t necessarily see that as having profound consequences  for your policy going forward. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Yes.  I have a question for Karen about a coupl e of the charts .  One of the things that struck me in looking at the char ts for the United  Kingdom—whether you look at price­to-rent  ratios or real house prices—is that they obviously have gone through several very sharp swings. If you look at th e U.S. historical charts, they’re pretty  benign.  Dave was just talking about the possible fallout of sharp swings in those me asures here, and I was curious whether we could learn anything about the macro consequences or the macro conditions asso ciated with what has happened in the U.K. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Well, for one thing, the U.K. ’s 1990 cycle was am plified by regulatory changes that preceded it, which led to mortgage le nding that was excessive and not well supervised. It was a kind of blind-leading-th e-blind situation: The regulator ch anged the rules and the financial institutions moved in to the market and practices and norms ch anged.  A great deal of lending took place.  The supervisors were lear ning as much as the lenders we re and—well, let me put it this way—it didn’t go well.  In the past, there has certainly been a co rrespondence between household consumption and housing wealth in the U.K.  So when they suffered the big drop in the 1990 rund own of housing prices, they also had a big change  in household consumption out of di sposable income, and so forth, and they had the makings of  a recession as a result.             67 of 234Now, a couple of the characteristi cs of the U.K. market have alwa ys led us to think that it’s not a telling example. One is the prevalence of variable-rate mo rtgages, which caus es the process of tightening monetary policy to contain the macroeconomy to have a bit of extra leverage over the discretionary income of households—to an extent that is not the case with fixed-rate mortgages Obviously, there’s a counterpart effect on the earning s of mortgage lenders, and so forth, in the U.S. economy that you need to take acco unt of to fully understa nd that.  But there is  that characteristic. And there is the fact that house prices actually fell in the U.K., so they had big negative equity problems, which complicate d the process of how to  unwind the interaction of household behavior and financial interm ediary behavior.  To the extent peopl e walked away from  the houses, the financial intermediaries we re getting collateral that perhaps no longer equaled the value of the loan.  On the other hand, some households  didn’t walk away; they just remained in a negative equity position for some time.  And that had a long, dampening effect on th eir spending patterns.  So there were complex reactions involved.   But this time around, at least based on my conversations with  U.K. officials, they think they’ve improved a lot of those things .  So in that sense, there is so mething to be learned.  Financial institutions now know better how to  maintain their balanc e sheets and how to do this lending.  The households know better, too; they’ve learned a bit.  U.K. officials think they ’ve seen a lessening to some degree of this tight link between housing wealth and consumption so that they’re not both on the run-up and then, when it stops, extra polating what the consequences would be. On the other hand, I have to ad mit that I occasionally  read my little  machine while I sit here, and in the last hour it carried three statements from a member of the Bank  of England’s Monetary Policy Committee who must have been making a speec h.  And all three stat ements the media chose to pick up pertained to whether or not housing prices ought to be  relevant for monetary policy.               68 of 234[Laughter] And all of the statements were sligh tly two-handed, along the lines of: Monetary policy should not be driven by housing prices, but we must look at them closely.  [Laughter] I think there are lessons to be learned; I’m not saying there ar en’t.  But certainly the 1990s episode had some ch aracteristics that were far more extrem e and that would never happen here because of institutional differences .  And the present episode, whic h has remedied some of those earlier problems, I think is not such a bad deal.  They’ve slowed the increas e in housing prices.  They aren’t having negative equity.  They don’t have financial institutions that look like they’re going to become or technically ar e insolvent.  I think in that sense they mo ved to improve their infrastructure, so to speak.  They talk about the issue a lot but I think they fe el the situa tion is okay at this time. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  May I raise a question, which puzzles me, on chart 13?  That has the new home price index and the OFHEO index.  I don’ t think there’s a big problem understanding the prices of new homes ex land.  Since homes ar e largely custom ized, one would expect that, as indeed the data show, the growth in productivity—and  presumably in unit labor costs in residential construction—is less than the averag e.  That would lead yo u to conclude that at constant margins the average real  price of homes is going up.  And the number is, as I recall, somewhere between 0.5 and 0.8 or 0.9, or something like that.  Now, after a house is constructed and priced, the price from there forward either is flat or goes down —I don’t think anybody presumes it goes up.  This gets to the issue of whether the modernization or the depreciation overwhelms. You have a system in which you have initial prices of  new homes, and let’ s assume there’s a age existing homes will exactly para llel the new home price.   Looking at this ch art, it’s very evident                    69 of 234that prices of existing homes on  average are rising faster—gene rally going almost all the way back—than those of new homes.  That  could imply that there is a change in mix.  In other words, if there’s a decay rate, then the pres umption is that the av erage age of existing homes that are being sold is moving down.  But none of the credible hypotheses—becaus e that can’t go on very long— explains this difference.  We know that the constant-quality new home price is a hedonic, reasonably well-constructed seri es.  How do we reconcile thes e data?  What’s happening? 

[SECTION]

MR. PEACH. Well, I think in part it may go back  to one of the issues discussed earlier about the rate at which replacement is taking place.  Now, I haven’t done this  in the most  scientific way, but if you just take periodic estimates of the stock of housing, whet her from the Census or from the American Housi ng Survey, and try to line up changes in the stock with new production, it appears that we’re in a period wh en a lot of destruction of old ho using is taking place.  As you mentioned, the average estimate on tear-downs is 300,000, but I’ve seen estimates as high as 700,000 units. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let me just say this.  We have this series on vacancy rates and ratios, and that series actually has an implicit housing stock figure.  If you take the figure for completions and match it up against that, for a good portio n of the last 10 years you get negative replacement. 

[SECTION]

MR. PEACH. Right. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So it’s not evident what those replacement numbers are.  We’re really at sea on what the actual total housing stock is, which is the problem we have with measuring population as well.  So I’m not sure you can make the statement that you just made. 

[SECTION]

MR. PEACH. Well, I think for a s horter time horizon you can say that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do you mean  like the period we’re in now?                    70 of 234MR. PEACH.  Yes, over the past four or  five years, I think it does hold true.

MR. PEACH. Right.  We ll, and also to the es timates of the stock.

[SECTION]

SPEAKER(?).  Page 14, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Page 14? MR. PEACH. It has been going  on for a long time, but I thi nk the separation has been most pronounced more recently. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That’s certainly true.  But is it credible that we can have a consistently more rapid rise in pr ices of existing homes unless the value of the land is rising faster for those homes?  Then there’s the issue we discussed ear lier about moving ou t into the suburbs, which undercuts the land price valu e of the new homes.  Do we have any insight into that at all? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  That is my op inion on the matter.  If you pu t a new home into place on a plot of land and follow that over time, the value of the stru cture might rise, reflecting an improvement to the house, or it might deteriorate.  But as for the land, once th e house is bu ilt, it falls into existing house land. That’s what it is from th en on.  And if th e value of that package of land and structure is going up and you think the va lue of the structure is not,  it’s coming in  through the land. If you flip to the very last page of the handout, page 33, the lower panel shows levels of the repeat transactions prices in red,  levels of the constant-quality price index for new homes in green,                   71 of 234and an estimate of construction costs.  That ba sically reflects the cost of a bundle of construction materials over time—a certain amount  of lumber, a certain amount of— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Th at can’t be far wrong. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN. If you look at th e pattern of the green  line, the constant-quality and the cost line move roughly together .  Obviously, the constant-quality pri ce index has increased more rapidly recently, because that index does cap ture partially, I think, increases in  land prices.  But I think that the gaps between the three lines are telling us quite a bit about what’s going on with regard to the price of land sitting under th e entire stock of housing.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You’re  implying, however, an answ er to the question I asked you before which you refu sed to answer [laughter],  which is the ratio of the land value to total value. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  There’s a difference betw een refusal and inab ility.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The ratio is—unless you were in ferring it between the two prices, which begs  the question— 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  Well, that’s exactly what Morris Davis— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, I understand that.  But it raises the question of whether the price data are accurate. 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN. Absolutely .  As I said, this is what I think is going on.  In my view, that’s what is capturing land prices. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Did you ever say wh at adjustments you make in the repeat-transactions OFHEO numbers? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  In my prepared text, no, I didn’t.  But I can go over them briefly.  Would you like me to—                 72 of 234CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Ca n you do it quickly? 

[SECTION]

MR. GALLIN.  Yes. I made an adjustment for improvement rate and depreciation rate.  And there are actually two types of transaction biases  I made adjustments for.  One is the fact that homes that have greater appreciation tend to transact  more and, therefore, th ey show up more in the repeat transaction database.  So I made an adjustment for that.  Also, two economists at OFHEO wrote a paper showing that there’ s another kind of bias—basically the high-end homes tend to appreciate faster than the low-en d homes—and that’s biasing the OF HEO as well.  So I made an adjustment for that.  Those are th e three main adjustments that I ma de to the repeat  transactions price data. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlic h, did you want to make a comment? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  I have three quick points.  On Sue’s point earlier about foreclosures, I think foreclosure rates nationally are too low to do anything with an alytically.  But in my world of low-income housing, in certain urba n neighborhoods they get up to 40 percent or so.  One can’t help but think that what happens—it’s like the old redl ining issue—is that first some foreclosures occur on a block, and pretty soon the values of the home s start going down , and then a lot of people stop making mortgage payments .  I don’t think that ha s macro significance, but it is a big problem in certain neighborhoods.  And that’s actually one thi ng I would like to work on when I leave here. On the discussion between Jo sh and Cathy earlier a bout affordability meas ures, I think that Cathy was trying to get you to sa y, Josh, what would ha ppen if interest rate s went up and nothing else happened.  But—pardon? 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That probably wouldn’t happen. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Well, that’s right.  I unders tand that the link between interest rates and prices is weak.  But really, there ought to be a full genera l equilibrium, if you will, calculation there.                     73 of 234Affordability rates may tend to be a lot more stable  than we would think ju st from interest rates alone, if it turns out that they  do have an im pact on prices. The third point: Janet ra ised what I thought was an interesting idea earlier that some people have picked up on, which is that maybe these credit inno vations are endogenous.  I recall a briefing that we had just a short time ago where the staff suggested that, in effect , what was happening—and I, frankly, was a little skeptical at the time—was that people were  identified by how much they could pay for their house.  And that, I think, makes the credit transaction automatically endogenous.  That may be a better way to look at the whole situ ation, and I guess resear chers at the Board have already started doing that.  I do n’t know how complete  their research is, but given our myopic society, that may be a much better way to look  at it—how much you can pay—and then nobody worries about what the implications are down the road .  But that explains th e initial buying decision. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is that  a statement or a question? 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Yes.  [Laught er]  Do I have to say?  If  somebody wants to comment, they can.  CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let’s choose to l eave it as it stands and we’ll end this discussion with President Fisher.  Do you want to make a comment? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  No, sir. Mine  was on a similar line,  neither a question nor a statement. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Dino, how long are your remarks? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. About 10 minutes. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why don’t we leave them until fi rst thing tomorrow morning?  Is that okay?  Let’s adjourn.   [Meeting recessed]                                   74 of 234June 30—Morning Session 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mr. Kos will start this morning. MR. KOS.6  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Most major asset markets were little changed in the intermeeting period.  The exceptions were: the price of oil, which rose; the euro, which fell; and corporate credit markets, which faced some turbulence after the downgr ade of GM debt.  The top panel graphs the 3-month cash deposit rate in black and the 3-month deposit rate 3 and 9 months forward in red.  The 9-month forward rate has been in a tight corridor for several m onths, thereby compressing the spread both to the 3-month forward rate and the cash rate. This co mpression reflects the widespread expectation that the end of the tighten ing cycle is approaching. end as early as this meeting, after Presid ent Fisher’s comments on June 1 and the weak employment report two days later.  Bu t subsequent remarks by the Chairman in his testimony and by other Committee members quickly reversed sentiment.   The 10-year yield fell 23 ba sis points in the intermeeti ng period.  That, coupled with the rise at the short e nd, led to a further flattening of  the curve.  This caused a flurry of commentary about what signa l the flattening was sending, and more ominously, the implications of a possible i nversion of the yield curve.  The middle panel graphs the 2- to 10-year Treasury spread since 1980.  The light dashed green line is the average spread over that 25-year period.  At its curre nt level of 35 basis points, the curve is slightly flatte r than the historical average.   The flattening in this cycle has been drama tic but is not without precedent.  Note that the flattening in the early 1990s was of similar magnitude and was followed by a period of pretty robust growt h.  Second, the level of the curve, at 35 basis points, is not out of line with other periods. As show n in the shaded rectangular area, the 2- to 10-year spread is now at levels that were  traversed in the second half of the 1990s.  Moreover, the spread was only slightly steeper during the 1980s expansion—a time when both rates and risk premiums were no doubt higher.  The conclusions that I at least draw from looking at the history are:  that the cu rrent flattening has earlier precedent; that the current shape of the curv e is well within historical norms; that inversions are rare; and that  while an inversion caused by further tightening cannot be ruled out, the scenario that is at least as likely is for long-term yields to rise in response to higher short-term rates. The bottom panel shows the 5- and 10-y ear TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected securities] breakeven rates for the first six months of 2005.  Those breakeven rates 6 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).         75 of 234have declined recently after rising early in th e year; they began to fall as inflationary expectations receded and the pr ice of oil backed off from its earlier highs.  In recent weeks oil and breakevens have diverged, with breakeven ra tes continuing to decline while oil rose to new highs above $60. One explanation for this paradox is the revival of the notion th at higher oil prices will act as a restraining factor on activity and thereby depress inflati onary tendencies.  TIPS traders, however, have been pushing an alternative explanati on: that technical reasons re lated to the seasonality of price increases creates this pattern where br eakevens widen early in the year and then fall back. In either case, the TIPS market is not sending out warning flares from the most recent burst in oil prices. While the Treasury market has been relatively well behaved, the credit markets experienced some volatility related to the news surrounding General Motors and Ford. Two days after the Committee’s Ma y meeting, the debt ratings of GM and Ford were downgraded to non-investment-g rade by Standard and Poor’s.  As shown in the top panel of page 2, GM and Ford spreads widened dramatically ahead of the line). Those spreads came in a bit but then widened again and are now near levels observed when the two companies were fi rst downgraded.  I should note that Ford was not downgraded by the other two rating agen cies and thus was reinstated into the investment-grade index.  Nevertheless, it trades at spreads that are well into high-yield territory. As I mentioned at the last meeting, the transition of billions of dollars in debt from the large investment-grade market to the far smaller non-investment-grade market is likely to take months.  Those inve stors needing to sell are likely to seek to avoid selling at fire sale prices.  But the sl ow pace of divestment creates an overhang that is apparent to everyone and probab ly helps explain the wideness of spreads relative to the index.  And yet the pe rformance of the broader high-yield and investment-grade indexes was rather tame, as  investors apparently  did not extrapolate the problems of these companies more broadly.  The problems at GM and Ford, and for that matter some smaller auto parts companies such as Collins and Aikman, di d show through into th e credit derivatives assumptions were modestly tested by this episode.  As shown in the middle panel, the CDX index of credit default swaps widened—as did the high-yield index, which is not shown—as hedge funds and others used th is index to hedge so -called “correlation trades” that began to behave unexpected ly.  Although the index has retreated somewhat, dealers report that liquidity ha s not reverted to normal and that some hedge funds are still look ing to exit bad positions. The bottom panel depicts the year-to-date  hedge fund performance according to one service that tracks hedge fund results. In aggregate, the f unds reporting to this service have had losses of about 2 percent since January.  That number is fairly modest relative to some of the more sens ational headlines, and it suggests that most            76 of 234funds have successfully managed their risk s.  Funds specializing in convertible arbitrage strategies fell more than 8 pe rcent and were among the worst performing groups. Of course, these averages obscure a wide variance in performance, including some that did far worse and in some cases announced plans to close.  The good news—from my standpoint at le ast—is that these funds deci ded to close rather than swing for fences in an attempt to rec oup their losses.  The remaining unknowns are just how many redemptions are still in the pipeline and whether there are losses still to be recognized by funds that are not adequately marking to market. Turning to page three, Europe was square ly on the radar screen this past spring.  With the French and Dutch referendums highlighting problematic  politics and weak data highlighting flagging growth, sentimen t toward euro-area markets was somber. The top panel on page three graphs the 3-month cash deposit rate and the same rate 3 and 9 months forward since March 1.  Earlier this spring the markets expected monetary policy to be steady, as it has b een for two years running.  But as the data deteriorated, the 9-month forward rate fell a nd is now trading below the cash rate as recent easing by the Swedish Riksbank and the expected easing in the U.K. has fueled expectations that the ECB [European Cent ral Bank] will shift gears relatively soon. Interest rates further out the curve also fe ll.  Meanwhile, with U.S. interest rates rising, a widening interest rate differentia l opened up favoring the dollar, as shown by U.S. and German 2-year yields in the middle right panel.  With sentiment poor even before the French referendum, with interest  rates favoring the dollar, and with random comments by fringe politicians suggesting th at some countries might exit the single-currency regime, it’s no surprise that  the euro depreciated toward $1.20.  The shift in sentiment toward the euro can  be seen in the bottom panels.  The bottom left panel graphs the 1-year risk reversal for the euro–dollar exchange rate, which recently favored euro puts for the first time in four years.  The bottom right panel shows the more recent shift in positions among noncommercial traders on the IMM [International Monetary Market], as th ey moved from being long euro to being short the currency.  Whether this trend will continue is now an issue that is occupying and sentiment is so bad toward the euro that  this trade may be close to running out of steam.  Meanwhile the depreciation of the euro  has offered a bit of relief to European exporters. The top panel on the next page depicts 10-year bond yields for Australia, the U.K., Canada, Germany, and the United Stat es.  Yields are on a gradually declining trend everywhere—countries in  the midst of a tightening cycle, such as the United States, and those like the United Kingdo m and Germany whose central banks are expected to ease soon.      77 of 234Japan reported better GDP data recently, but many market participants expect Japanese growth to revert to its previ ous pattern.  Hence, 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields have also fa llen back to about 1.20 percent.  The middle panel graphs the JGB curve as of yesterday and as of one year ago.  The weight of liquidity from the Bank of Ja pan’s quantitative easing policy has pulled more of the yield curve toward zero. Finally, let me say just a quick word on global equities.  The bottom panel graphs the performance of selected eq uity indexes in lo cal currency terms (the blue bars) and in dollar terms (the red bars).  The stock markets of the U. K., France, Germany, Italy and Japan—toward the right side of the panel—all looked better than the S&P 500 in local currency terms.  However, with the appreciation of the dolla r, their performance turned negative. Interestingly, Brazil a nd Mexico exhibited the opposite effect: far better performance in dollar te rms because their currencies rose against the dollar.  If there are strains from the imbalances that  are being talked about, it was difficult to find evidence of that in the past seven weeks. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m fascinated by the correlatio ns in the daily movement of rates among the five major countries shown at the top of page 4.  I’ m even looking to  see whether or not it is apparent in the data that Australia is 12 hours behind th e United States, and I can’t tell  whether we’re following Australia or  they’re following us.  But the convergence in these markets is getting to be notable. On page 1, the bottom chart on  the TIPS breakevens and the crude oil futures price, I can understand why there may be a de bate with respect to the divergence from early May between the  crude price and the TIPS.  But the  arguments that are made  for that divergence then make me look at the previous period where the co rrelation is in exactly the opposite  direction.  So, it doesn’t strike me that either explanation is particularly credible. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I think that’s one  of the reasons some of the traders are looking for other explanations, such as technical explanations related to the seasonal pattern.        78 of 234CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That would be a huge  seasonal adjustment.  It doesn’t make any sense. I cannot believ e, with all the hedge f unds losing money, that the ability to pick up a seasonal and exploit it has not been  ground away time and time again.   Is there any evidence that seasonality still exists in these markets that are arbitragible? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I haven’t done the analysis.  The way the story is told is that because the TIPS works off of the non-seasonally adjusted index,  you do get these patte rns because of pricing— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, but we  know what the seasonal is. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Exactly.  So, you would expect pe ople to take advant age of that, which— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I think the explanation—ba sed on my long-term recollection—is that people  look at three years and they see, for three years,  prices moving a certain way.  Therefore, th ough there’s no subs tantive reason, they base judgme nts for later years on that.  And the fourth year, obvious ly, when they try to play  it, they lose money. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. I think the argument, Mr. Chairman, is that  the residual seas onality is in the underlying.  That is, the compensation you get is based on the not  seasonally adjusted CPI, so the arbitrage is actually to have the real rate get a seasonal  to offset the se asonality in the underlying. The one thing I would note in terms of the diverg ence between the near-term oil futures and the TIPS inflatio n compensation is that we’ve also seen a difference in the behavior of the front-month contracts and the long er-dated contracts in oil futures.  During the latter part of the period where they’ve moved differently, it has been more of a paralle l shift.  That is, if you don’t anticipate future declines in oil prices—if you were reading it off future s markets—whereas earlier you did, TIPS market participants would presumably price in anticipated future declines in oil prices and its consequence for the CPI.  But in the last month or two, it has been flat.                                 79 of 234CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions for Dino?  Mr. Vice  Chair, would you move approval of the domestic operations?   VI

[SECTION]

CE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  So moved. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection, they are approved.   Let’s move on to the chart show presentations by Steve Olin er, Dave Wilcox, and Mike Leahy. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER.7 We have received a fair amount  of data since we closed the Greenbook. Just this morning, BEA reported th at real consumer expenditures, shown in the top left panel, were flat in May.  This was actually a bit stronger than we had expected, but there was also a small down ward revision to April.  For the second quarter as whole, shown in the inset box, we  project that real PCE increased at a 3.1 percent rate, unchanged from the Greenbook forecast.  Meanwhile, housing activity continues to be robust, with sales of new and existing homes (shown to the right) having remained at historic ally high levels in May.  Turning to business spending, we received  new data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods after the Greenbook clos ed.  As shown by the red line in the middle left panel, shipments edged up in Ma y, while orders (the black line) softened a bit. These data were nearly spot on the Greenbook estimate and point to a moderate rise in real E&S [equipment and software] spending this quarter.  Looking ahead, the results of the Reserve Bank queries on capital spending plans appear broadly consistent with a solid upward track for ou tlays.  As shown in the panel to the right, 42 percent of the respondents expect to incr ease their spending over the next six to 12 months, while only 12 percent plan to decr ease spending, similar to the results in Moving to the lower left panel, the data on initial claims released this morning showed that the four-week moving averag e (the red line) edged down to about 325,000, a level that we estimate to be consis tent with moderate growth in payroll employment. Rounding out this review of recent indicators, we received new data this morning on PCE prices. As shown in the inset box to  the right, the core index rose 0.2 percent in May, a tenth below our Greenbook forecast.  Also, the increase in March was revised down a tenth, although th at revision was confined to  the nonmarket part of the index. The latest data leave the 12-month change in the core PCE index at 1.7 percent.  Your next exhibit briefly describes th e key background factors for our projection. As shown in the upper left panel, we assume  that the federal funds rate (the black line) will gradually rise to 3¾ percent by the en d of next year, very similar to the path 7 The materials used by Messrs. Oliner, Wilcox, and Leahy are appended to this transcript (appendix 3).             80 of 234in the April Greenbook. Long-term Treasury rate s (the red line) are expected to hold about steady through next year, following a pa th just a shade below that assumed in percent of GDP and remains at about that level in 2006; these fiscal assumptions are essentially unchanged from the April Greenbook.  Among the other key background factors, we have taken on board the upw ard surprises during th e intermeeting period for equity prices (the middle left panel) and house prices (the panel to the right), which raised the assumed path for household we alth.  In contrast, th e higher oil prices in this projection (the lower left panel)  and the recent apprec iation of the dollar (shown to the right) were negatives for our growth forecast.  On balance, the revisions to these background factors ha d little net effect on our  projection of real GDP. The next exhibit summarizes our forecast of growth and inflation.  As shown by the black dashed line in the top left panel, we project that real GDP will expand roughly 3½ percent this year a nd again in 2006, just a bit fast er in both years than the growth of potential. As you can see in the table to the right, since January we have revised down the forecast of GDP growth a bout ¼ percentage point in both 2005 and 2006. On our current forecast of GDP growth, we  expect that the unemployment rate (the middle left panel) will hold steady at its current level of 5.1 percent through the end of the forecast period.  As shown to the right, the projected path for the unemployment rate has not change d much since the January Greenbook. With regard to inflation, the lower left panel shows that we project core PCE prices to rise a bit more than 2 percent th is year and a tad less  than 2 percent in 2006, up from the 1½ percent increase recorded last year.  The table to the right shows that the projections for this year and next are each up half a percentage point from the Dave Wilcox will now continue our presentation.  

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  As you know from the Gr eenbook and as is shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 4, the unemployment rate is currently just a tenth of a percentage point above our estimate of the NAIRU.  To put the matter delicately, however, the most impressive aspect of our estimate of the NAIRU may be the imprecision of it:  According to one representative econo metric equation, a 70 percent confidence interval around the point estimate of the NAIRU extends 2 full percentage points from top to bottom.  Accordingly, one might reasonably ask whether any evidence can be marshaled to corroborat e our view that a smidgeon of slack still remains in the labor market. The upper right panel presents one such b it of evidence.  As shown by the black line, the participation rate has declined a perc entage point over the past five years.  To be sure, the model that we use to analyze movements in the participation rate writes off part of that decline as reflecting tr end demographic developments, summarized by        81 of 234the red line. But the larger part of the overa ll decline, according to the model, reflects a swing from a participation rate that was above its tre nd level through the late 1990s to one that has been below its trend level the last few years.  On our interpretation, conditions in the labor market were suffici ently uninviting to cause some workers to take themselves out of the workforce.  But as job opportunities continue to improve, these workers will be available to rejoin  the labor force—and will do so in great enough numbers to hold the participation rate steady despite a declining trend. The middle left panel shows a broad meas ure of conditions in the labor market— total hours worked relative to trend. Th is measure combines the effects of the unemployment gap, the participation rate gap, and the gap in the workweek relative to its trend, not shown but currently about zer o.  As you can see from the chart, total hours worked remain a little below the es timated trend despite the recent gradual improvement in labor market conditions. The idea that some labor market slack remains is corroborated by a few other indicators. For example, as shown in the middle right panel, indivi duals still perceive jobs as somewhat harder to get than they  were in the first half of 1997, when labor panel, the NFIB [National Federation of Independent Business] reports that small businesses still are not encount ering quite as much difficulty  filling positions as they did in the first half of 1997. I should also note that a few other indicators suggest that the labor market is at least as tight as it was in early 1997.  For example, as shown in the lower right panel, the percent of em ployed people working part-time for economic reasons has fallen below its average over the first half of 1997. That said, we still see the balance of evidence as sugge sting that a little slack remains in the labor market, but that the ma rgin is narrow, and narrower today than it was six months or a year ago.  Moreover, such slack as may still exist will, on our projection, essentially be taken up over th e course of the next year and a half. Other things equal, in the past, labor market slack has restrained the growth of nominal compensation and thus has helped to keep price pressures in check as well.  And yet, as shown in the upper left pane l of exhibit 5, compensation per hour as measured in the BLS’s [Bureau of Labor Statistics] Productivity and Cost [P&C] system soared more than 10 percent in th e fourth quarter of last year and posted another hefty increase in the first quarter of  this year.  As shown by the black line to the right, even on a four-quarter basis, the growth of compensation per hour has picked up sharply in the last two quarters, raising the ques tion as to whether underlying compensation pressures are build ing and whether they may be feeding price inflation. We think not, for two main reasons. Firs t, as shown by the blue line in the upper right panel, the other main indicator of compensation trends, the ECI [Employment Cost Index], has actually been decelerati ng slightly since mid-2003, suggesting that the compensation situation may be a good deal less alarming than one might conclude            82 of 234based on the P&C measure alone.  Second, we diagnose the recent bulge in compensation per hour as having been influen ced by a spike in stock option exercises, which we think have little bearing on firms’  pricing decisions.  Indeed, the last time a bulge of this sort occurred in comp pe r hour, in 2000, core PCE price inflation—the red line in the upper right panel— responded little if at all.   The middle left panel reviews some of the c onsiderations that lead us to implicate option exercises in this matter.  For now, in  the interest of time, I will only touch on the first and most obvious fact or, namely, that option exercises are included in P&C compensation per hour but not in the ECI.  The attribution of a sizable portion of the spike in comp per hour to option exercises is  important, because growth in that form of compensation is not likely to pe rsist at its fourth-quarter pace. Indeed, to that point, the middle right  panel summarizes our outlook for the growth of compensation per hour. As shown on line 1 of the table, we have the four-quarter change in P&C comp per hour coming back down sharply this year, as about half of last year’s fourth -quarter spike is unwound.  As shown on line 2, we have ECI compensation per hour moving up along a sm oother trajectory, pushed up by the gradual tightening of labor markets, the continued pass-throu gh of increases in structural productivity to real  wages, and the lagged effects of higher consumer price inflation last year and this year. Ov erall, on our numbers, the growth of compensation will be moderate enough to allow a gradual deceleration in core consumer prices from here forward while  still permitting firms to maintain the the past 35 years. But we could be wrong about all of that, and the bottom two panels illustrate the potential consequences of a misjudgment on our  part.  As outlined in the lower left panel, we sketched an alternative s cenario in the Greenbook in which hourly compensation increases 1 percentage point faster than in the baseline over the remainder of this year and next.  In addi tion, we assumed that firms have sufficient pricing power to protect thei r profit margins, and are able —by the end of the scenario —to return the markup to its baseline value.  As shown by the dashed red line to the right, the resulting boost to core PCE price inflation is s ubstantial:  By the end of 2006, core inflation is running at a 3 percen t annual rate and headed further north from there. While we view a compensation-led spiral as a risk to the outlook, we do not see compensation as having been a major source of the recent upward creep in core inflation. But if not co mpensation, then what? The top left panel of exhibit 6 steps back  and reviews the scope of the recent run-up in core PCE price inflation.  The red line in this panel shows the evolution over the past 18 months of our forecast for core PCE inflation during 2004.  As shown by the leftmost point on that line, back in December 2003 we forecasted that core PCE prices would increase about 1.1 percent over the course of 2004.  As shown by the            83 of 234peak in the red line, by August of last y ear, we had marked our forecast up, on net, about ¾ percentage point, to 1.8 percent.  Thus far, in any event, that August forecast has proved to be a little too pessimistic; as shown by the rightmost point on the red line, our latest estimate—which now simply tracks the published figure for 2004 from the BEA—is 1.6 percent. The blue line similarly tracks the evolu tion of the forecast for 2005.  There, as you can see, the upward revision in our forecast has been more pronounced.  As shown by the rightmost point on the blue line, the current Greenbook calls for core PCE inflation to come in this year at 2.1 percent.  As shown by the green line, we did not begin providing a forecast of inflation in 2006 until last September’s Greenbook, but since then, that forecast has followed  a similar upward trajectory.  So what has been going on? The panel to the right provides half of the answer:  As you are well aware, oil prices have surprised both us and the rest of the world greatly to the upside.  As you can gauge from the vertical distance between the dotted blue line at the bottom and the dashed black line at the top, the forecast implicit in oil futures contracts back in But other developments have worked in the same adverse direction.  As shown in the panel to the middle left, the PPI for core  intermediate materials prices also has risen considerably faster than we expected as of a year and a half ago, and is expected to continue along its current higher trajectory.  Similarly, import prices (shown to the right) have risen faster, on net, than we expected in December 2003, even though events have unfolded a little more favorabl y than we had expected as of December 2004. The table in the lower left panel trac es through the implications of these developments for our inflation outlook.  As shown on line 1, between December 2003 and last week’s Greenbook, we’ve revised up our estimate of core PCE inflation in 2004 by 0.5 percentage point, on net, and ha ve marked up our forecast for inflation this year 1 percentage point.   Lines 2 and 3 show that the deterioration in the oil outlook can account for about half of the upwar d revision in both years, while  import and materials prices can account for nearly  all of the rest, leaving only a small amount, line 4, to be explained by other factor s.  We take some comfort from this result because we expect the upward impetu s from the sources represented on lines 2 and 3 to prove transitory. As shown in the table to the lower right, as those transitory influences wane, we expect the inflation picture to  improve.  For this year, as you know, we have topline inflation (line 1) coming in at  2½ percent again, little different from last year, before dropping back to 1¾ percent next year, unde r the influence of the swing in energy prices. And, as shown on line 4, we ha ve core PCE inflation stepping up ½ percentage point this year before moderating slightly next year.           84 of 234Given that oil prices have surprised so  much to the upside, one might have expected our projections for the growth of real GDP to have been marked down substantially of late. But, as shown in th e upper left panel of e xhibit 7, that has been only partly true. This panel does for the growth of real GDP what the one from the preceding exhibit did for core PCE inflation. Thus , the red line shows the evolution of our projection for real GDP growth over the four quarters of 2004.  As shown by the steadily sinking portion of th at line, which paralleled the feeling we had in our stomachs at the time, we marked down our pr ojection for the growth of real activity substantially as the bad news came in during the first two-thirds of 2004.  By contrast, our projections for 2005 and 2006 have been re markably stable.  How could this have been so? The panel to the upper right s hows that the increa ses in oil prices relative to what we had assumed in the December 2003 Greenbook in fact were, on our estimates, a major negative for the growth of real GDP both last year and this.  As shown by the red line, we estimate that oil price increases  trimmed half a percentage point from the growth of real GDP in 2004. And, as shown by the blue line, they will cut nearly a percentage point from the growth of real GDP in 2005. Clearly, oil price effects can be only part of the explan ation, because they fail to explain the full extent of the disappointme nt in 2004 and they explain too much in 2005. The middle left panel fills part of th e gap.  As you will r ecall all to o clearly, our estimates as to the influence of the pa rtial expensing provisi on proved rather wide of the mark.  As shown by the declining he ight of the bars marked “2004,” over the course of the past year and a half, we have progressively trimmed our estimate of fiscal impetus in 2004, explaining anothe r 0.2 percentage po int of our overall downward revision. By the same token, the bars marked “2005” show that the patching of the pothole plus some unanticip ated defense spending have added to the projected growth of real GDP this year. The table to the middle right summarizes th e net effect of these two influences.  As shown on lines 2 and 3, the increase in oil prices and the reduction in fiscal stimulus can explain about half of the shortfall in 2004 grow th relative to our projection on the eve of the year. The re maining 0.7 percentage point was a puzzle in real time, and largely remains so today. For 2005, the parsing-out exercise  yields a tidier result:  By our lights, oil prices were indeed a big negative, but that negative was almost  completely offset by our miss on the partial expensing provision.  W ithout doubt, other influences have been bearing on the growth of real GDP but, conveni ently, they happen to net to zero in the arithmetic for 2005. One implication of this exercise is that the underlying growth of demand— supported, to be sure, by low interest rates and appreciable gain s in housing and stock         85 of 234market wealth—has been pretty robust.  L ooking ahead, we expect oil to remain a negative for the level of real GDP, but not to  any great degree for its rate of growth going forward. Thus, if oil prices flatten out, as we assume, we would expect the relatively robust pace of underlying demand to show through to topline growth. The table at the bottom of the page summa rizes our outlook for the growth of real GDP. As shown on line 1, for this year a nd next, we expect real GDP growth to average about 3½ percent per year. This grow th rate is close to our estimate of the rate of growth of potential, so (as shown on line 7)  the output gap closes only a little from its current level of about 1 percent.  Throughout the projection period, domestic final sales are the key driver of aggreg ate demand, supported by interest rates that remain quite low.  Net exports (line 5) subtract a little less from the growth of aggregate demand this year, but resume their more substantial pace of erosion next year. Inventory investment (line 6) is exp ected to be about neutral for real growth this year and next. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER. We will now focus on a set of key financial issues for the outlook.  Your next exhibit explores whether mark ets appear to have built in sufficient allowance for risk—in effect, taking yester day’s discussion of asset valuation to staff’s measure of the earnings-price ratio for the S&P 500 (the red line) and the real yield on a synthetic Treasury perpetuity (t he black line).  The gap between the two series provides a rough estimate of the equity  risk premium.  Currently, the gap lies within the range that prevailed from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, before the bubble period in the stock market.  By this admittedly crude metric , stocks appear to be priced with an adequate allowance for risk. The middle left panel explores the sa me question for corporate bonds.  The shaded area shows our estimate of the risk  premium in the high-yield bond market, calculated as the difference between the high -yield spread over Treasuries (the red line) and the part of that sp read that compensates for the expected loss from defaults (the black line). Earlier this  year, the implied risk premium fell to the lowest level since the go-go days of the late 1990s. However, the problems at GM and Ford appear to have sparked a renewed apprecia tion for risk among i nvestors, boosting the premium back to a level that appears to pr ovide appropriate compensation for risk in the current economic environment. Yesterday’s discussion of wh ether houses are overvalued raises the same question for commercial real estate. As President Yellen noted yesterday—fully anticipating my remarks—the middle right panel shows th at the prices of commercial properties (the red line) have been rising at a good clip in recent years even though the net operating income—or NOI—that they generate (the black line) has been falling.  This divergence has pushed down the ratio of net operating income to property prices, the analogue to an earnings-price ratio for equitie s.  The lower left panel plots the NOI­to-price  ratio against the synthetic Treasury perpetuity yield.  As you can see, the gap between the two series has narrowed in rece nt years and currently sits in the lower              86 of 234part of the range observed over the past de cade, which might be viewed as cause for concern. However, the case for overvaluation in commercial real estate is not open and shut by any means.  Net operating income has been held down by the unusually high vacancy rates that emerged several years ago.  But, as shown in the panel to the right, the fundamentals for commercial real estate  appear to be improving.  The vacancy rate for office buildings—one of the hardes t-hit property sectors—started to tip down last year and, according to preliminary data, it fell further in the second quarter.  In addition, the market rent for av ailable office space has turned up in recent quarters.  If demand for space continues to firm, the appare ntly rich prices for commercial real estate may turn out to have been justif ied, as investors—in retrospect—will have correctly looked through a tem porary period of weakness.   Your next exhibit addresses another ques tion that has attracted attention:  Is corporate credit quality starting to  slip?  The first point to no te is that, at present, the corporate sector is in excelle nt financial shape overall. As shown in the upper left panel, the default rate on corporate bonds and the delinquency rate on C&I [commercial and industrial] loans at banks are both very low.  In addition, as shown to the right, the share of cash flow that nonf inancial firms devote to meeting interest expenses (the red line) has continued to decline, and these firms still have a large stockpile of cash (the black line). That said, we believe that the high point of the credit cycle is now behind us.  For starters, firms have begun to disgorge the ca sh on their balance sheets.  As shown in the middle left panel, cash payouts to shareholders jumped in 2004 and remained high in the first quarter of this year, reflecting in creases in dividends (the  dark blue part of the bars), share repurchases (the lighter blue  part), and cash paid to the shareholders of target firms in mergers (the red part).   These payouts may well represent the best use of otherwise idle cash, but they do le ssen the resources available to repay the firms’ creditors. Two developments in the bond market ar e noteworthy as well.  First, bond issuance has shifted toward weaker firms. As shown in the panel to the right, high-yield firms accounted for more than 40 pe rcent of the bonds issued by nonfinancial companies in 2004, the highest share in more than a decade.  The high-yield share thus far this year, while dow n from 2004, remains well above its historical average.  Second, the use of the proceeds from high-yiel d bond issues has shifted in a direction that is less supportive of credit  quality.  As indicated in the lower left panel, from 2001 to 2003, fully 70 percent of the proceeds from these issues were used to refinance existing debt, as firms focu sed on improving their balance sheets.  However, that share declined last year and fell again in the first half of this year.  This drop has been mirrored by a sharp increas e in the use of bond proceeds to finance LBOs [leveraged buyouts], other merger activ ity, and payouts to sh areholders.             87 of 234Ultimately, the financial health of the business sector depends on its capacity to generate profits. As shown to the right, the profit share for domestic nonfinancial firms, measured as economic profits divided by sector GDP, now stands at a relatively high level. We expect this shar e will retreat somewhat over the forecast period, as it normally does in a maturing e xpansion.  Even so, we anticipate that profits will remain strong enough to prevent a sharp deterioration in corporate credit quality. Your next exhibit turns to the ques tion of whether households are facing significant financial stress. Judging by the delinquency rates shown in the upper left panel, which are all relatively low, th e household sector appears to be doing reasonably well. Moreover, lenders seem  to have a sanguine view of household finances. As shown to the right, the most recent Senior Loan Officer survey—taken in April—indicated that ba nks, on net, have been easi ng their lending standards for consumer loans. To dig beneath these aggregate indicator s, the staff has begun to analyze the household-level data collected from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF).  As noted in the middle left panel, the resu lts are preliminary and will be subject to some revision as the SCF staff continues to process the data.  I should stress that the results are confidential until the public release of the 2004 data, which is scheduled for January of next year. The black line in the panel to the right pl ots the share of households that reported having any debt payments at least 60 days past due.  As shown, the share in the 2004 survey—at nearly 7 percent of households —was higher than in any prior survey, indicating that financial st ress has become more widespread.  This trend would appear to conflict with th e low delinquency rates I cited a moment ago.  However, those series were based on the dollar amount of delinquent debt, while the black line in this panel measures the fraction of SCF households with a late payment.  The red line puts things on more of an “apples-to- apples” basis with the upper left panel by presenting the share of aggregate debt held by SCF households with a late payment.  As shown, these households accounted for 4¾ percent of total household debt in the 2004 survey, a figure within the range from  earlier surveys.  Thus, from a macro perspective, the SCF data suggest that repayment problems are not unusually severe, although the incidence of  stress has risen.  The lower left panel summarizes some a dditional findings from the survey with regard to household balance sheets.  First, the substant ial rise in household assets from 2001 to 2004 was driven by the apprec iation in house values and was fairly widespread across income groups.  At the same time, the survey revealed rapid debt growth throughout the income distribution.  For households with income near the median, assets and debt moved up by about the same amount, leaving net worth little changed between 2001 and 2004. However, net worth rose quite a bit for high-income households.                88 of 234Turning our attention back to  aggregate data, the panel to  the right indicates that we expect household net worth, scaled by di sposable personal income, to rise a tad further before edging down next year with the assumed slowdown in house-price appreciation. Taking account of the lagged response of spending to changes in net worth, this contour implies that wealth effects will make a sizable positive contribution to the growth of real consum er outlays this year and will be roughly a neutral factor in 2006. Mike Leahy will now continue our presentation. 

[SECTION]

MR. LEAHY. The top left panel of exhi bit 11 presents our outlook for foreign real GDP growth. We forecast total foreign growth to move back up this quarter from a soft first-quarter pace and to rise a bit further going forward.  The pickup is modest and reflects our assessment of the balance between some opposing forces.  On the one hand, higher oil prices, while supportive for some economies, are expected to damp activity, on balance, for our foreign aggregat e, which is weighted by U.S. exports.  On the other hand, financial conditions app ear to be more uniformly supportive of growth abroad. Many foreign currencies have  depreciated against the dollar since the beginning of the year and, as shown on the ri ght, stock prices in emerging-market and industrial economies have moved up since th e middle of last year.  Emerging-market bond spreads, shown in the bottom left panel,  backed up a bit from their lows earlier this year but are still tight by historical standards.  And benchmark long-term interest rates abroad have moved substantially lowe r, as shown by the red line in the bottom right panel. The widespread decline of long-term rates has been a prominent topic of discussion recently, and many hypotheses have been offered to explain it.  I do not propose to resolve that debate .  [Laughter] However, the extent to which rates have exhibit. As shown in the top left pa nel, the yield on the German government bond was essentially equal to the 10-year Treasur y yield in October 2003, a date that falls before any of the central banks discusse d on this page began tightening monetary policy. Since then, the bund yield has declined about 120 basis points and is currently just off its record low of 3.10 percent.  The yield on the Canadian bond, shown in the next column to the right, has declined nearly as much, at 110 basis points over the 20-month period.  These developments contrast with the smaller net decline of 80 basis points in the United Ki ngdom, and the much smaller net declines of 40 basis points in the United States, and 20 basis points in Japan.  The size of the As shown in the middle row of panels, most of the decline in foreign long-term yields appears to be related to  a slide in real in terest rates.  Inflation compensation, as measured by the spread between these nominal  and inflation-indexed interest rates, has not changed appreciably on balance for these economies over the past 20 months.            89 of 234The relative size of these real and nomi nal yield movements appears to reflect monetary policy actions taken during the peri od as well as expected future actions.  With the exception of Japan, long-term ra tes have fallen more in economies where tightening has been the least.   None of the major foreign central banks has tightened monetary policy as much as the FOMC has over this period.  As shown in the first panel of the bottom row, monetary policy in  the euro area, where the largest decline in bond yields occurred, has been on hold since June 2003.  Market expectations that the ECB might soon raise rates, a view heav ily promoted in ECB rhetoric of only a month ago, have all but vanished. In Canada, where bond yields have declined substantially also, the Bank of Canada has lowered polic y rates on net since October 2003, but markets appear to expect the tight ening that occurred in September and first of these central banks to start tight ening, in November 2003, has raised its policy rate 125 basis points over the period, and at th is point markets appear to expect that the next move for the Bank will be to lowe r the policy rate.  Nonetheless, long-term rates are down whereas short-term rates ar e up.  Monetary policy at the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has not changed significantly. The BOJ has continued to pursue quantitative easing, and reserve balances stepped up over the period. The low level of real long-term interest rates in the euro area and Japan should help smooth the way for more robust expansi on of activity in those economies.  Other financial factors, presented in your next exhibit, should also lend support.  Positive equity earnings forecasts, shown at the t op left, should help lift stock prices and reduce the cost of equity finance for firms.   Forecasts of earnings per share, drawn from surveys of equity analysts in mid-June , put earnings this year  above last year’s, and forecasts for 2006 show further increases. BBB corporate bond spreads, shown to the right, are relatively low, which imp lies that corporate bond financing costs have generally followed government yields down.  And the recent deprecia tion of the euro and yen in foreign exchange markets, shown in real effective terms in the middle left panel, should provide some boos t to net exports going forward. Despite these positive financial conditions, higher oil prices, firms’ reluctance to invest, and worker concerns about wages, pensions, and employment are restraining growth, especially in the eu ro area.  As shown by the black and blue lines in the middle right panel, confidence in the euro area has taken a beating, with industrial confidence dropping sharply and consumer confidence remaining low.  All told, we see euro-area growth, shown in the bottom left panel, slowing some this quarter before eventually edging higher, to about 1¾ percent in the second half of this year and next year. The outlook for Japan, while not much stronger, at  least has a slight upward trend, driven by a slow but steady further increase in employment and incomes.  As shown at the right, Japanese GDP growth rebounded sharply in the first quarter, led by strong gains in consumpti on and investment spending.  Inventory accumulation also contributed positively.  We  expect growth this quarter to drop back, as inventories are run down and as consumer and business spending growth moderates.          90 of 234Your next exhibit examines  the potential implications of recent changes in the behavior of Chinese trade. The top le ft panel shows a 12-month moving sum of China’s merchandise trade balance over the past 20 years.  In recent months, the Chinese trade surplus has jumped to record  levels.  As shown on the right, exports have continued to grow along trend, but im ports appear to be decelerating.  The counterpart of the lower import growth is showing up elsewhere in Asia as a slowing of exports to China. As shown in the mi ddle left panel, the growth of exports to China from Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, thr ee of the region’s la rgest economies and also three of China’s top trading partners, has dropped from very rapid rates to near zero. We see two developments that are cons istent with this shift.  One is that economic activity in China is decelerating.  Policy measures adopted a year ago to restrain runaway investment  spending, which had increased more than 40 percent over the four-quarter period immediately prio r to the implementation of the measures, as we regard the double-digit GDP growth rates of the recent past as unsustainable.  The other development is that China may be turning inward for some items that it had been importing, including heavy industry item s like iron and steel and road vehicles.  As shown at the bottom left, exports of road vehicles have ramped up since 2002, and exports of iron and steel rock eted up last year, as capacity  to produce steel internally came on line. As shown in the bottom right panel, China’s extraordinary growth does not seem to have triggered broad-based inflation pre ssures.  The consumer price inflation bulge in 2004 came almost entirely from increas es in food prices, and they have not persisted. Your final exhibit presents our outlo ok for commodity prices and the U.S. external accounts. As shown by the black line  in the top left panel, prices of nonfuel primary commodities have increased substantially in the past three years, boosted in part by global growth but lif ted also by the depreciation of  the dollar, shown at the right. The metals price component of this  index (the red line) has registered the largest price gains. Over the next year  and a half, primary commodity prices are forecast to change little, as world dema nd is expected to stay strong and supply response comes on line. The spot price of oil, shown in the middle left panel, has continued to rise, as has the price implied by futures contracts matu ring about six years out, shown by the red line. Increasing doubts about future supply from Russia, Venezuela, Iran, and Iraq have apparently cooled expectations that oil prices will retreat much from their current, elevated levels.  Potential supply s hortfalls are of particular concern because OPEC has little spare capacity and world oil demand is expected to continue to be strong. Our outlook for the U.S. current account deficit is shown to the right.  The deficit is projected to widen from about $780 billi on in the first quarter of this year to        91 of 234$960 billion, or about 7¼ percent of U.S. GDP, by the f ourth quarter of 2006.  With the dollar projected to depreci ate only modestly from its current level, U.S. GDP growth on a par with or a bove aggregate foreign growt h, and oil prices remaining high, the trade balance, shown at the botto m left, deteriorates $113 billion further over the forecast period. The projected decline in net investment income is almost as large, at $79 billion. The growing negative contribution of  net investment income to the deficit reflects expanded net holdings of U.S. liabilities and an assumed increase in U.S. short-term interest rates. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER. The final chart displays  your economic projections for 2005 and 2006. As shown in the top panel, the centr al tendency of your projections for the growth of real GDP this year came down s lightly from the projections in February, while the central tendency of the projected rise in core PCE prices was revised up a bit. The central tendency for the projected unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year is now a shade below that in  February.  For 2006, your  central tendencies indicate essentially no change in real GDP growth from th is year’s anticipated pace, no change in the core PCE inflation rate, a nd no change in the unemployment rate.  If you should decide to update your projections, we request that you submit your revised forecast to Dave Stockton by th e close of business tomorrow. We would now be pleased to take any questions you may have. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. On char t four, suppose we took the lower left chart, “Jobs Hard to Fill,” as being representative not only of small business, but literally of the economy as a whole.  Wouldn’t that, in fact, be  the best measure we could possibl y get to determin e the slack in the system?  Wouldn’t that be measuring it right at the poin t where it matters? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  I think there woul d be something to be said fo r that.  As I look at these indicators, I see profiles that look very  similar across the six panels, and so— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Do they ever diverge significantly, as far as the signal they are giving?  

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Well, our interpretation has be en that the labor force participation rate, shown in the upper right panel, has been sending a little differen t signal from the unem ployment rate over the last year or so.  That the pa rticipation rate—whose sources we understand imperfectly— declined sugges ts that there is a little  more productive capacity  remaining or more of         92 of 234an underutilization of labor reso urces than one would infer from  the upper left panel on the unemployment rate. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  On exhibit 5, in looking at P&C compensation, it’s not only that it surged at the end of last year, which we attributed largely to  bonuses and the ex ercise of stock options, but it has surged really since the second quarter of 2004.  Since that time the quarterly increases have been 6.0, 5.5, 10.2 , and 6.3 percent.  Ho w do we interpret that?  Do we basically have the same story for those data , or is something else going on? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  As I look at the upper right pane l, I see two indicators that seem to be swinging aro und each other.  P&C comp per ho ur had been a little to the soft side of the ECI for a time and then it moved a little  to the high side of that.  I don’t have a particular st ory for the change in the profile from earlier. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mainly it was the seco nd and third quarters of last year that were significantly above expectat ions and, indeed, quite  above the ECI.  Yet I don’t recall our attributing that to stock option exercise or anything like that. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  No. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I assume  it’s not just benefits but wages and salaries also. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  I think that’s correct.  MR. STOCKTON. We didn’t thin k at the time that  we needed much special explanation because, as you can see in David’s upper right-hand panel, the four-quarter change in comp per hour was still below 5 percent and it only edged a bit above  the ECI.  So, we didn’ t really see that as a divergence. As David noted, we went through a period from mi d-2001 through mid-2003 where comp per hour was runni ng below the ECI.  We were viewing the acceleration that occurred in the P&C measure through the midd le of last year as a series being just a bit noisier and running a little             93 of 234above the earlier pace. It was really when we got to the fourth quarter an d had that extraordinary increase—which we do think refl ects to some degree the stock opt ion exercises and bonuses—that we thought that story wa s an important one in explaining the divergence. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Now we  have the April and May da ta.  Roughly, what do they tell us about the second-quarter annual rate? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Well, in a sense, we’re carrying two sets of books.  And this mystery isn’t going to get unwo und for quite some time because it won’t be until August that the UI [unemployment insurance] data are incorporated for the first quarte r, and that will give us the beginnings of a read on whethe r we were right or not.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So, essentially, the BEA wage and salary data are merely extrapolations.  Indeed, from an economic point of view, they don’ t really give us new evidence; they are just extrapolating the basic change. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Our understandin g is that they’ve taken down a wedge—to run off some of that—but we think it’s going  to come down a lot more  in the final statistics. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, but that doesn’t tell us anything.  That just te lls us what they are guessing at. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  That’s exactly right.  I have here the quarterly pattern that we have written down for comp per hour, and I’d be happy to give  it to you.  It’s a little  misleading because what we’ve done is assumed that that runoff is going to happen over the course of 2005. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You ac tually have answered my question.  You won’t have any real new data until August. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  That’s correct. Th at’s when the UI data will be incorporated for the first quarter.           94 of 234CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich.

MR. GRAMLICH.  Sticker shock qu estion:  In the history of th e world, has a country ever run a $1 trillion curren t account deficit? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I don’t think so.  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Is that your question? MR. GRAMLICH.  Yes.  I didn’t say it was heavy!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That’s called tr uly rhetorical.  President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  I may be asking your question over again, Mr. Chairman, but I’m looking at exhibit 6—at the PCE projections and the explanations for why core PCE is increasing.  I guess what you’re saying is that these are the reasons why.  Then, going ba ck to your discussion of labor costs, there’s no discussion  of productivity.  So, are you more or  less dismissing that as a factor in terms of having a follow-through and pushing up core PCE?  Are you saying that labor is not that significant a factor?  The issue of productivity comin g down seems to me to be more relevant than suggested here. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  You’re correct.  In our analysis, these are the key drivers, in terms of the factors that are shaping the contour of— 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Not comp ensation and not the po ssibility of productiv ity coming down and being less able to absorb that factor in the future? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  No, that’s correct.  In terms of the f actors contributing to the deceleration in core PCE price inflation between  2005 and 2006, what I’ve show n here—energy prices, import prices, and these other relative prices that I’ve  chosen to proxy by the intermediate materials prices—are taking off somewhere between ¼ and ½ percentage point from core PCE inflation, in our estimation.  At the same time, we think that so me of the past increases that have occurred have           95 of 234gotten built into the structure of inflation a bit.  Wh ether one labels that “inflation expectations” or “inflation momentum,” it is awfully hard to disentangle.  As for productivity, we think that it’s mainly structural productivity that matters for firm s’ pricing decisions, not fluctuations in actual quarter-by-quarter productivity.  So  we have that as essentially a neutral influence on inflation over the projection period.  The fact th at we tie pricing decisions to st ructural productivity developments rather than actual productivity may be what is colliding with your intuition. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Part of what leaves me uneasy is that in the Greenbook the last several times we have recognized that PCE inflation has be en higher than we thought it would be and we are projecting it to tu rn back down again.  In this sense, there’s a continuation of the view that these things are temporary and that they  will back off at some point.

MR. WILCOX.  This chart is trying  to get at exactly that sort of iterative process of a futures right-hand panel. And ye t, meeting by meeting, the futures market—and we  along with it—figured that oil prices would level out fr om that point forward.  Sometime s, for our inflation outlook, the absence of a negative is a positive— in the sense that with oil pri ces not moving up further in our projection, we don’t have  that upward impetus. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. The way we handle the oil price is really a technical assumption. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Futures prices of o il cannot move up at an exceptionally rapid pace and stay significantly beyond the cost of  storage and interest beca use there’s an arbitrage there that will convert the forwar d demand back to the spot demand.  So, if you have a run-up in spot prices, it’s almost never the case that the future s market will be at that sa me pace.  So this type of environment would tend to bias those projections down.         96 of 234MR. WILCOX.  I agree with that , but the profile of oil prices  is markedly different now, with an extraordinary skyrocketing of the far-dated futures.  One of  the most amazing developments over the last— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I’m really surprised.  I mentioned that in a speech recently; the spread between the six-year fu tures price and the spot price has closed.  And no one has picked that up. It’s unbelievable. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  It’s illustrated in  Mike Leahy’s exhib it 15, on the chart in the middle left panel. There has been a marked change in th e relationship between near-dated and far-dated futures. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I get quo ted on everything under the sun that is irrelevant, but that was a really meaningful  insight and it got lost!  [Laughter]  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Let me just follow this conversation a li ttle further.  If I get this right, what is new in the forecast, based on this conve rsation today, is  that you’re anticipating a little more pe rsistence in what we view as the unde rlying rate of the core PCE deflator.  And it ends the forecast  period higher than we previously ex pected.  Again, that is in the context of a forecast where you’ re expecting both o il and commodity prices—and import prices, too, I think—not to be  a source of negativ e pressure.  They constitute a so rt of positive factor on the inflation dynamic.  And you ’re expecting structural productivity gr owth to stay fairly high.  What is interesting, I think, is  that you haven’t changed your im plied path for the fed funds rate significantly.  I guess my question is: Why is that?  It’s  not that your grow th forecast has come down and is significantly softer.  It’s not as if you’re substantiall y more pessimistic  on the outlook for growth relative to potential.  So why wouldn’t that view on  inflation, if it’s right, have induced you to prescribe a slightly higher path?                97 of 234MR. STOCKTON. In part I’d answer that ques tion by saying that I don’t view our funds rate path as a prescription.  We ar e not trying to convey to you what you should do.  In our thinking about this, we were confronted wi th a couple of crossc urrents in the forecast this time around that led us just to leave the funds rate  path unchanged.  On e was that we got high er inflation and higher inflation forecasts, which might have  been pushing us up.  On the other hand, much of that was a supply-shock kind  of effect where we were getting higher oil prices and a stronger dollar, and those factors would have been weakening GDP had we rais ed the funds rate.  So, that confronts you as policymakers with the choice.  It’s not that we think you ought to pick the fund s rate path we wrote down as the baseline forecast.  It’s a case in which you’re confr onted with a shoc k, and that has made the tradeoff less favorab le for you, and you’re going to have  to think about ho w much of that you would want to take in lower output  and how much in higher inflation. So, you’re right, we could have raised the fu nds rate path.  We showed an alternative simulation in which you tightened a bit more aggressively and that brings the inflation rate down to 1¾ percentage point at the cost of  something on the order of 3 pe rcent GDP growth going forward.  That’s about all I’d have to say on that. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  If I understood the Bluebook di scussion of this correctly, in that optimal control exercise , whatever its merits, with your  assumption about the symmetrical tolerance or intolerance to devi ation from your objectiv es, still you have th e nominal funds rate going to 4 percent with an infla tion objective assumption of  1½ percent in that  context.  And the difference between that view and the view that you put into the Gr eenbook, which I realize is not a prescription—I’m sorry I used that term—is what explains the difference between those two things? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I think part of the purpose of putting th at in the Bluebook was to suggest that if you in f act view your objective as  1½ percent on core PCE inflation and you want to           98 of 234react in the way that optimal pa th suggests, you would need to be tighter than in the baseline assumption in the Greenb ook.  Those differences are pretty sm all because while I don’t follow that path precisely, I use that as some guidance in thinking ab out where to set the funds rate path for the Greenbook.  Our goal is to put a forecast on the table that would be helpful to you in your discussion. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  But are you as suming a higher implicit inflation objective in the way you think ab out the Greenbook construct? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. You could view  that either as a higher inflation objective or, as I’m assuming, more patient monetary policymakers—a cas e in which you achieve that objective over a longer period of time. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I wanted to ask a different question on the international side.  Karen, on the external fo recast, how much of a change is this view of where the current account-GDP ratio goes relative to yo ur expectation six mont hs ago or thereabouts?   It seems to me that it looks slightly darker. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I thin k it’s the dollar. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Yes, that’s my point.  Where do you expect it to stabilize now? 

[SECTION]

MR. LEAHY. The dollar? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  No. What happen s to the current acc ount if you project out a little longer th an the forecast horizon you have now? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Sticker sh ock, sticker shock, an d more sticker shock. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I know, but it crosses 8 percent and goes to what?        99 of 234MR. LEAHY.  It depends on how fa r into the future yo u want to go.  It’s  an unsustainable path. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Absent a dollar depreciation that’s  now probably on the order of 8, 9, or 10 percent, the deficit is going to steadily worsen.  If th e dollar were to start depreciating, that would slow the rate of deterioration.  If the dollar depreci ation that we put into the forecast were to get as high as 8 or 9 percent, that  might plateau the deficit. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. On e thing we can be sure  of is that the va lue of the dollar will be worth 100 cents.  [Laughter] David, do you contemplate that the end- of-month NIPA revisions could alter the intermediate history, which could have an e ffect on the forecast? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. At this point, obviously, wh at we don’t know dwarfs by several orders of magnitude what we do know.  We do know from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers that the M3 data probably overstated the gr owth rate of capital sp ending in 2003.  That could be a source of downward revision. And the annual retail sales revi sions also pointed to a little softer path for consumer spending.  I wouldn’t wa nt to make a big deal out of those things, simply because there’s so much else that  we will learn that could comp letely offset them.  But if we had to  guess now, we’d expect the changes to be in th e direction of a small downward revision on the level of GDP. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Gross domestic income  has started to run well ahead of gross domestic product.  Is th at something that is likel y to be exaggerated or am eliorated?  Do you have any notion of that at all? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. If I had to guess, I’d say ameliorated in th e sense that in the last couple of quarters when that gap has go tten quite large, it was being driven by the very rapid gains in compensation per hour.  No w, another reason for us to think that these increases are probably            100 of 234reflective of something like stock options is that if you wanted to  measure output from the income side, what the income side would be  saying is that there must have been an explosion of growth in output over the fourth and first qua rters.  We just don’t see that confirmed by other evidence either in physical product data from industrial production  or labor market devel opments.  We see nothing that would suggest that th at in fact occurred.   We’re expecting that the BEA is still not going to know anything for probably another couple of years in terms of getting income data that would actually allow them to pin this down.  But our expectation is that there probably would be  some downward revision to corporate profits in 2004 to reflect the fact that some of that involved stock optio n exercises that have not yet been picked up in corporate reports. 

[SECTION]

MR WILCOX. Even there,  though, the timing within the y ear is very uncer tain.  We don’t know how they parse it out across the quarters and whether it would line up tightly with the stock option story. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I want to take up  the issue of oil sticker shock and particularly the distant futures prices.  The revisions over the past 18 months or two years have really been extraordinary— essentially a doubling in the long-ter m price of oil.  My impression is  that the market revisions have been driven probably by upward revisions of the impact on oil demand as sociated with long-term growth in China, and perhaps India as well, and also questions about pro duction capacity in the Middle East.  Some of the reserve numbers have been revised down, an d that sort of thing.  But I haven’t seen much discussion abou t the long-run demand el asticity.  You’d think that with this big a price change that would be an is sue—and also elasticities of altern ative supplies of which I suppose the most important over a horizo n of five years would not be nu clear but coal; the latter has        101 of 234possibilities of significan t expansion.  What do we know about the longe r-run demand  elasticities that might start to come  into play over the next few years and that might check this upward momentum in the long -run price of oil? 

[SECTION]

MR. LEAHY. I think we’re seeing attempts now in so me parts of the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia, to try to expand capacity for oil.  As for these alte rnative sources, I don’t know if we’ve reached the trigger points  yet where expanding their produ ction has become profitable. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I understand that with alternatives like shale and that kind of th ing.  But how about the more conven tional alternatives, which I guess would be coal, by and large?  There must be expansion opportunities there; it’s import ant for generating electricity. 

[SECTION]

MR. LEAHY. I’m not sure. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. To the extent th at China’s electricity system is a source of demand, China has a lot of coal reserves, wherea s they have no petroleum reserves .  So in principle they could expand their electrical capacity—which is obviously a big part of the infrastructure effort that’s going to be necessary  for China to keep growing—by using coal. Most of the thoughts about the long-run picture in this regard relate  to the uncertainties imposed by environmental considerations—whether it’ s refining capacity, expanded use of coal for the generation of electricity, more  use of LNG [liquefied natural gas] to spread the natural gas resources of the world in ways more  in tune with demand for natural gas, and so forth.  All of these things pose fairly substa ntial environmental hazards or have sh ortcomings, and they get tied up in the politics of it. Now, we’re fairly convinced that in the long run these elasticities are powerful.  But the people who trade on these forward curves  know at least as much  as we do, and they probably know a whole lot more than  we do.  So we’re im plicitly saying that we think this is built into that forward curve.              102 of 234MR. POOLE. What abou t on the demand side?  What do those longer-run elasticities look like? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. One issue is  the fact that some of these co untries subsidize.  That is, the price run-up to date has been passed through only partially to c onsumer demand in many of the emerging Asia countries.  And as a consequence, some of these governments have had a big hit to their budget deficits beca use of these subsidies. Now, if you think about 2004 versus 2005, the ru n-up in oil prices last year proved to be a transitory phenomenon, and I think they believe th at that policy worked well.  They buffered their populations a bit, and th ey didn’t take the political heat about  higher oil prices.  And they were right; the oil price came down and all was well.  Th ey tried it again this year, and they are now confronting these high futures prices that Mike  was emphasizing.  So some of them are now relenting and are proposing to pass through into consumer prices, over some staggered path, the price increases that we’ve se en.  I would assume that will have a measurable effect. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  What would the de mand elasticity be in the Unit ed States?  We passed those through pretty quickly. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I can’t give yo u an actual number, but I’m sure in the longer run it’s minus 1 or something like that. People will say that in the short run it’ s almost zero.  I think even that is an exaggeration.  You can always turn dow n the heat, or whatever.  But I think you’d get a reasonable number like minus 1 if you looked over a five-year period. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. You think it’s even as big as minus 1?  Over the horizon here, these long-term futures—that’s si x years out—you’d probably get a good part  of that over a si x-year horizon, if it’s viewed as a permanent—         103 of 234MS. JOHNSON. We know from past history th at the oil intensity of  GDP stepped down in the period immediately following the oil price shock event, but it did not continue to improve continuously. That chart is very much like a step-function; most of the gains occu rred early on when we first experienced the signif icant changes in relativ e oil prices.  We also  know that there’s a lot of difference acr oss countries in oil intensit y.  Some people conclude th at that mean s we can all be as efficient as the most effici ent country, so there’s a lot of room to  improve.  That’s a little naive because some of those di fferences reflect industrial structur e and the like.  Somebody has to produce the aluminum, right?  We  can’t all save money—save o il and energy—by not producing aluminum.  So, some of those diff erences are more permanent.  Bu t some of them involve just a failure to take the steps that others have taken.  There’s scope there, too. I think there’s no better solution to this problem than to let prices show through. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I’ll continue to plow that ground just for one minute.  I’m struck a bit by the fact that the stories on the run-up in commodity prices and o il prices are all about China and India.  You have a forecast here where China’s grow th falls off fairly dramat ically.  Growth in the rest of the world I would describe as maybe more of a downside risk.  You point out the uncertainty in Europe and Japan and you’ve ev en marked down econ omic growth in the United States.  Yet your commodity prices tend to be rath er flat.  All this ru n-up was associated wi th China, India, and global growth.  You have global growth dampening, but we don’t seem to r ecover much in the way of these commodity prices—oil being one, but others in general.  I’m obviou sly missing something.  What is it? 

[SECTION]

MR. LEAHY. In part it is th e supply response in some of the metals and presumably in food and other—           104 of 234MR. FERGUSON.  You’ve told me in the past that the supply response in co pper tends to take a year or two.  The pri ce has not been high enough necessa rily, but one would have thought we’d start to see some supply re sponse, getting these prices to come down even more quickly. 

[SECTION]

MR. LEAHY. These forecasts are based on the futures q uotes.  There may be some differences in view between our forecast for China compared with  what the futures markets are thinking. They might be  a bit more upbeat abou t the outlook for China. But we do have a little downward tilt here, and I th ink it’s consistent with some slowing in China. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Yes. And rememb er, what we’ve done is just decelerate foreign activity; and we’ve hugely decele rated commodity prices. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. I think that’s a fair point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Steve,  I want to ask some questions about your exhibits 8 and 9, having to do with the high-yield debt market.  If I put toge ther the middle left panel of exhibit 8 and the middle right panel of exhibit 9, I begin to ge t worried about whether the market is pricing for risk appropriately.  The upper left chart on exhibit 9 sh ows that defaults  jumped in the 2001-2003 period.  From your chart, it looks like those bonds were issued in 199 7 and 1998, and it appears that that was the last ti me spreads were so sk inny.  We’re back to skinny spreads now.  We’ve got another bump-up in issu ance.  And I know ba nks are easing credit standards.  Is the cycle, should we expect to see in 2006  another jump in high-yield defaults? 

[SECTION]

MR. OLINER. Earlier this year , we were really concerned th at the market was underpricing risk. If you look at the panel you referred to at the middle le ft of exhibit 8, wh en the gap narrowed to its narrowest point there, we re ally did not understand what had caused that.  Our view is that     105 of 234defaults are going to  rise somewhat.  Yo u can see our forecast in the black line in the middle left panel of exhibit 8.  That’s our es timate of the compensa tion for both defaults and losses due to less-than-full recoveries that would be needed in the current environment.  We have that drifting up some; we don’t have it rising dram atically.  In our view  what is different now  from, say, the late ’90s is that a tremendous amount of balance shee t restructuring has occurred.  That has left even high-yield issuers, on net, in a better po sition with regard to their in terest service capabilities and their cash on hand th an they were in that earlier period.  We see them starting from a very healthy position after a tremendous amount of restructurin g and turmoil in that sector.  We think it’s downhill from here, but not steep ly downhill in our judgment.  So , we’re taking a middle-of-the­road view in expecting things  to worsen but not dramatical ly over the forecast period. MS. BIES.  Thanks. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Mr. Chairman, c ould I just correct something th at I said earlier?  On the revisions to GDP, we have received data that we think will ultimatel y result in a downward revision to E&S spending, but it’s not clear that they actually are going to get incorporated in the annual revision that comes out th is year.  Evidently  the Census schedule curren tly calls for their revised data to be given to the BEA after the annual revision, so they won’t be picked up.  That’s the biggest of the components of the data that  we’ve gotten toward revised GDP. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I think I’m going to cede my time, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. MR. SANTOMERO.  I found the exhibit 6 disc ussion on the evolu tion of the Greenbook forecast interesting and in formative.  There’s one thing that I’m still a bit puzzled by as we look forward from here.  The forecast has a gradual deceleration of pr ice increases between this year and              106 of 234next.  At least some of that is a deceleration as sociated with import pric es.  I guess the question I have for you is: How conf ident are we that import price decel eration will give us the kind of inflation moderation that  is in the forecast? 

[SECTION]

MR. LEAHY.  Is the question abou t the import prices or about go ing from import prices to the inflation measure? 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  The import prices. 

[SECTION]

MR. LEAHY. Well, our forecast, obviously, is fo r import prices to dece lerate.  That’s based on forecasts that the dolla r will flatten out, ro ughly, or dec line only moderately going forward, and that commodity prices will also be  relatively flat.  So, to the extent you put a lot of confidence into those forecasts, I think you could tr ansfer that to our outlook for im port prices.  That’s how we do the forecasts. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Okay.  Let me put it more pointedly.  Do yo u put much trust in those? I can do the arith metic, but do we believe it? 

[SECTION]

MR. LEAHY. I think forecasting asset prices has a high stan dard error around it; it’s not a very precise art. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  This is really an extensio n of the first point that President Geithner made—that the context in which we’re making these policy decisions is a framework based on a forecast of inflation.  To the extent that we’re getting this—I’ll call it exogenous—decline in the inflation pressures associated w ith imports, that says something about the optimal strategy from a monetary policy point of view.  On the other hand, to the extent that that’s an assu mption in which we have little confidence, th e implication is that  we may find ourselves back  at exhibit 6 again.  We would be ratcheting up our expectation of inflation because  what was supposed to reduce it— namely, the reduction in inflation of import prices—didn’t materialize.         107 of 234MR. WILCOX.  But the risk that you are pointing to, President Santomero, is illustrated in the middle right panel.  That shows the step -up from the trajectory in the December 2003 Greenbook (the dotted blue line) to the December 2004 Greenbook (the dotted red line).  Now, as it happens, the revision to the outlook since December 2004  is a little to the favor able side in terms of U.S. inflation performance, as s hown by the downshift from the dotte d red line to the dashed black line. So there is risk. I think Mike’s point is that we think we have the risks reasonably balanced.  The risks are two-sided.  So we could be coming back to you with an exhibi t 6 that would have a figure in the lower left that was revised down or revi sed up from the 0.4 of a percentage point.  It’s not a one-way risk; that’s the point.  

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. The dolla r could well conti nue up.  Much of this  more favorable outlook owes to the fact that the dollar, on balance, has risen rather significantly over the course of 2005; and indeed it has risen rather si gnificantly over the past six weeks.  In looking at the global economy and listening to th e chatter out there,  I think there’s no reason th at one could ever say with confidence over a horizon of one year—or even two or three year s—that we know th e dollar will be lower at that future point than it is today.  We don’t know that.  We know that probably a lot of things that are consequen ces of the dollar continuing to rise will  lead to some buildup of pressures to eventually stop that ri se.  But over the kind of  horizon we deal with in  the Greenbook, we have learned the hard way that  the random walk  is the best at titude to have. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I just have a qu ick question, going back to th e oil issue.  There are some 770,000 outstanding futu res contracts on the NYMEX.  If you look at the CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission ] data, 11 percent of those are no ncommercial players—what they call Wall Street and city refiners .  To the extent that the staff measur es that as an infl uence, I’m curious            108 of 234as to what percentage of the spot price or of futu res prices do you consider to be weighted by the nonfinancial players?  Are they a driving force or ar e they inconsequential? 

[SECTION]

MR. LEAHY. Well, we’ve certainly been hearin g a lot about so-called speculative players in the market. With respect to oil markets, inve ntories actually have been trending up a bit even as prices are going up.  So, there’ s some kind of specu lative activity going on currently, it would appear. But as for pars ing out exactly how much reflects the traders on the exchange, I don’t know. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We do, obviously, have the data weekly on the net positions of noncommercial parties.   And they are effectively a claim against the inventories, which by definition are held only by commercial parties. My recollection is, howeve r, that the information has not been terribly useful in projecting prices.  There doesn’t seem to be a systematic component in the crude price pattern that is mirrored in those data.  I thin k these are largely hedge funds and the like, and they basically follow trends.  Even thou gh they’re not all that small in te rms of the contribution to the overall demand and supply contracts, it’s hard to  use them as yo u indicated.  We’ve tried. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I was just curiou s about whether we know or fe el that they can exacerbate trends in a direction. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, th ey probably do.  But the explanatory part of the price moves owing to that particular set of data is less than significant—or at least we haven’t been able to infer any significance. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Who would like to start the Committee discussion? President Moskow.        109 of 234MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  In recent weeks we’v e heard a wide variety of views about business conditio ns in the Seventh District.  Most sectors have good news as  well as some bad news but, overall, cond itions are positive and seem consistent with an economy growing near trend. Evidently, accommo dative policy is offsetting th e drags from en ergy and the international sector. Within manufacturing, heavy equipment producer s continue to report strong sales growth.  For example, all 21 of Caterpillar’s business units  are above plan.  This y ear some of their product lines have sold out for 2006, and they have begun taking orders fo r 2007.  In cont rast, one of our directors who is the CEO of a la rge diversified manufacturing comp any reports a surprisingly sharp slowdown in orders, although he co ncedes that business had been gr owing at an unsustainably high rate. The Chicago Purcha sing Managers’ I ndex, which will be released  today, edged down from 54.1 in May to 53.6 in June. In retail, apparel sales are generally strong an d mall traffic seems go od, but a retailer in home furnishings reported a marked slowdown in sales during the past six to eight weeks.  In motor vehicles, GM noted strong sales in response to its new marketing program.  GM and Ford both continue to forecast light  vehicle sales of about 16.8 million units in 2005—the consensus forecast from our recent auto outlook sy mposium had similar numbers for 2005—and they expect sales to remain near this pace in 2006. Labor markets continue to impr ove.  Temporary-help firms re port that growth is moderate, not spectacular. They say demand is soft for low-sk illed workers, but it is st ronger for professional, technical, and clerical workers.  And average temp wage and benefit increases have held steady in recent weeks.               110 of 234The news on the price front is similar to what we’v e seen in the last few meetings, with increases for plastics, rubber, and heavy machin ery—and, of course, ener gy.  Integrated steel producers are burdened by high coke and iron ore prices.  In contrast, steel scrap prices have fallen 35 percent from their peak in November of last year, whic h reduced the costs for the mini mills. Turning to the national outlook, since our last meeting we’ve learned th at the soft patch was temporary, as many of us expect ed.  Furthermore, the core inflat ion numbers improv ed but energy prices moved up even further, as we’ve just been discussing. Looking forward, our outlook is  very similar to the forecast in the Greenboo k, with growth slowing in the current quarter but pi cking up somewhat in the second half of the year.  On balance, we project that GDP will increase  at a rate near 3½ percent both  this year and next.  The story underlying this forecast is a familiar one.  Ac commodative monetary pol icy and the trend in underlying productivity appear sufficient to offs et the current drag from higher energy prices. On the inflation front, we don’t see broad-based resource co nstraints pushing up prices.  The pass-through of cost pressures to  consumer prices has been modest.  In fact , Mr. Chairman, after you left our board meeting two weeks ago, my directors gave me a hard time regarding the suggestion that businesses had any pricing power  at all.  In addition, in flation expectat ions remain contained, even with the most recent increase  in energy prices.  So we see core PCE price inflation peaking at 2 percent this year and edging off a touch next year. Of course, we should not be too sanguine.  It would be unfortunate if underlying core inflation drifted above 2 percent, and there is some risk of that happening.  Resource slack has narrowed, as Dave Wilcox  pointed out earlier.  An d given our uncertainty as  to the true level of potential output, we may already ha ve closed most meaningful reso urce gaps.  With oil prices reaching $60 a barrel, we have to be very careful that inflation ex pectations do not increase.  This         111 of 234could happen if we are perceived to  be improperly monetizing the high er oil prices.  Therefore, it will be important for us to continue to re move policy accommodatio n in order to contain inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations. So at this meeting, we should increase rates by 25 basis points.  For the remainder of 2005, we may need to increase rates more than currently expected  by the futures market s.  I agree with the view expressed by some people during the chart sh ow: Risk management sugg ests that a path with higher interest rates would be a better course fo r our policy than the one outlined in the futures throughout 2006, as the markets expect, is  simply too low.

MR. SANTOMERO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in  the Third District softened somewhat in late spri ng, but this appears to be temporary and our business contacts continue to expect gains in line with recent trends.  Retail sales fell in May.  For many area retailers, this was attributed to cold and rainy weather in the early spring, and early reports in June suggest that sales have picked up with th e return of warm weat her.  The outlook for auto sales, however, remains subdued.  Earlier in the year, dealers had been optimistic that auto sales would improve.  Now they expect fe wer sales this year than last.   Manufacturing activity in the District also we akened in June.  After showing a sizable rebound in April, the index of general activity weakened in May and turned negative—with a reading of minus 2.2—in Ju ne, which is consistent with flat ma nufacturing activity.  The indexes on new orders and shipments remained in positive terr itory, and our respondents did not expect this lull to last.  They generally expect ed activity in employment to pi ck up over the next six months.          112 of 234As part of the Board staff’s survey, we polled the District’s  business contacts, including those in manufacturing, reta iling, and services, on their plans for capital sp ending over th e next 6 to 12 months.  About half of our fi rms reported that they planned to  maintain capital spending at current levels.  Plans for increased spending we re more prevalent among nonmanufacturers than manufacturers, while planned reductions we re scattered across both types of firms. Activity in other sectors of th e region continued to expand in the intermeeting period.  The downward trend in nonresidential construction appears to have bottomed out, and commercial real estate leasing activity ha s been rising.  There have been si x consecutive quarte rs of positive absorption.  The pace of home sa les has risen since the winter and was about steady during May, at a very strong pace.  House-price appreciation continues to be strong. Regional employment continues to  grow, although not as strong ly as in the first quarter.  Employment rose in each of our th ree states for the first two months  of the second quarter.  The three-state unemployment rate declined from 4.8 percent in the first quarter to 4.5 percent in April and May. Business contacts continue to  report that it is di fficult to find employe es to fill openings.  One of our contacts says the labo r shortage in southern New Jersey  has reached crisis proportions.  One pharmaceutical firm in the District is br inging in workers from its plant in S eattle, while a large energy company in our Dist rict is trying to attract skilled labor from as far aw ay as Alabama.  Other companies report that it’s taki ng much longer to hire people than wa s true a year ago. Price pressures in the District continue to build but at a slower pace th an earlier this year.  The current and future price indexes in our manuf acturing survey moderated in June, but remained at relatively high levels.  A special manufacturing survey question in May rev ealed that nearly half of our participants had raised prices of their product lines since the beginning of the year, and about 40 percent said they expect further increases this year.  Retailers report that , while wholesale prices         113 of 234of the goods they are purchasing have been roughly steady, fuel  surcharges are common on goods shipped to them.  In summary, econom ic conditions in the Third District softened a bit in the late spring, but indications suggest that this is te mporary.  Regional business cont acts remain upbeat and generally expect an improvement in the region’ s economy in the months ahead.   My assessment of the economic co nditions in the nation is similar to what it  was last month.  The expansion continues with the fits and starts one e xpects to see as the economy approaches a sustainable growth rate and full em ployment.  The revised data suggest that there was not much, if any, soft spot in the first quarter.  While some of the recent monthly data have been on the soft side—for example, May employment growth and re tail sales—these follow months where the data were on the high side.  Payrol l employment has averaged  180,000 per month th is year, consistent with our forecast.  Although the sec ond quarter is likely to be softer  than the first quarter, averaging through the monthly volatility  shows an economy that is growing ne ar its potential and is close to full employment. Higher oil prices will likely have some damp ening effect on economic activity and put some upward pressure on inflation, but the effects need no t be strong enough to di vert the expansion.  The economy has proved quite resilient as  the price of oil increased from $30 a barrel at the beginning of 2003 to over $60 a ba rrel more recently. I’d like to compliment the Boar d and Reserve Bank staff on th e housing price discussion.  I found myself somewhat comforted by the analysis showing rather benign effe cts, at least at a macroeconomic level, from the pot ential drop in real estate values.  And I also wanted to compliment the staff on the analysis  of the behavior of long-term interest rates.  It was useful to                 114 of 234review the various potential explanat ions for the decline in long rates as short rates have risen and to think about their diff erent implications for monetary policy. That said, I find the argument s that lower long rates migh t be signaling a persistent economic slowdown unconvin cing.  None of the fore casters we poll is predic ting such a scenario.  For example, our most recent survey of profession al forecasters suggests sustained output growth over its forecast period.  I find th e explanation that focuses on an increase in demand for long-term debt relative to supply mo re interesting.  But as the staff points out, the reason for the outsized demand would be relevant, as would informatio n concerning its expected persistence.  The implication for monetary policy would presumably depend on the source of the demand and its perceived persistence. Putting the pieces together , our forecast is similar to that in the Greenbook.  We both see the economy expanding at near potentia l and closing in on full employm ent.  The major difference is that the Greenbook projects a decline in core inflation between this year and next, while we are projecting a rise in core inflation; hence, my question ear lier.  We think there is less slack in the labor market, so we expect growth  in hourly compensation to run above productivity gains and to accelerate modestly in 2006, leading to a modest rise in unit labor costs.  This rise in unit labor costs translates into a slowly increasing core inflation rate.  We also anticipate some depreciation of the dollar, which will cause a modest rise in import prices, and we anticipate some pass-through from the energy price increases into core  inflation.  I believe inflation w ill remain well contained over the period, provided we rema in focused on our goal of price stability.   Consistent with all of that, our forecast incorporates a steeper path for the fed funds rate than does the Greenbook.  Give n my assessment of economic conditi ons and the forecast, I believe it’s prudent to take another measured step in removing policy accommoda tion.  As we discussed at our             115 of 234last meeting, it seems like ly that we will co ntinue to raise rates until we  actually come to what we perceive to be the end.  Given the underlying strength of the economy, the potential for increased inflation, and the fact that po licy remains accommodative, I do not think we’re at the end of the tightening cycle.   Regarding the language, I’ll leav e the specifics to the policy discussion.  But our discussions last month persuaded me that we have su fficient flexibility with the current language and that the time to make significant changes may be when we pause and feel uncer tain about the future direction of policy or when we think a significant change in policy is requ ired.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Anecdot al reports from our  regional contacts and the most recent data releases  suggest that business conditions in the Southeast have remained positive since our last mee ting.  Florida, as has been the case for some time, has been dominant in terms of both employment growth an d the pace of economic activity,  given the strength in sectors such as tourism and housing. Coincident indicators, like personal income  and state tax revenu es, suggest that our District’s growth over the past several mont hs has averaged about 3 percent, with major contributions coming not only from Florida but also from Alabam a and, to a lesser extent, Georgia and Mississippi. District employment growth has been averaging roughly 35,000 per month until the disappointing report of only 3,000 new jobs in May.  Our regional unemployment rate has been running about 0.2 percentage point be low the national average.  Howeve r, absent Florida, the rest of the District underperformed  the nation as a whole.                 116 of 234The apparent slowing in employment growth was a concern in terms of the regional outlook, although I would say that recent anecdotal reports on hiring are more encour aging than the official data.  It seems to me th at the key question from a policy perspective is whether there are signs of regional imbalances on either the price or the real  side that might shed lig ht on the national picture and on the broader risk to e ither growth or inflation. With respect to growth, the capital spending  survey suggests that planned investment spending in our District remains solid.  And the motivations for th is are now more rooted in the expectation of increased sales rather  than the need to cut costs, im prove productivity, or to replace obsolete technology.  Having said that, let me note that we received some interest ing and sobering anecdotal comments from our dir ectors.  One director from the paper pulp and forest industry expressed concerns, perhaps selfish concerns, about the overexpansion for certain manufactured building supplies.  He indicated, for example, that production capacity for bu ilding products such as gypsum wall board, concre te, and manufactured lumber  was on a pace to expand 30 to 35 percent worldwide over the next three years.  In the specific  case of one product that is dear to his heart, oriented strand board, he said that the increase looks more like 40 percent. He characterized the industry’s very aggressive investment spending plans as preparing to, an d I quote, “jump off the cliff yet again.” [Laughter] Our reports indicate that investment spending has also increased in the air cargo freight area, driven by international demand.  Our bankers tell us that commercial and industrial lending remains highly competitive, with a resulti ng narrowing of spreads, althoug h credit quality c ontinues to be good. Our director from the forest product sector noted a continue d softening in paper box demand, which he has found to track nondurables very closely.           117 of 234Finally, there is the housing s ituation, which we talked ab out for a long time yesterday afternoon.  As I’ve been reporting for several mee tings, some of our market s, especially those in coastal areas of South Florida an d the Florida panhandle, are expe riencing a level of building activity and price increases that ar e clearly, in my view, unsustainabl e.  Nearly every major Florida city now has experienced increases  in the double-digit range, and some, like Miami, Palm Beach, Sarasota, and West Palm, have been reporting incr eases in housing prices on a year-over-year basis of between 25 and 30 per cent.  While our discussion yesterday did not seem to indicate a consensus on a national housing bubble, based on past experience I’m reasonably comfortable characterizing the housing feeding frenzy in some of our markets as being a bubble or a near bubble. For example, the number of major projects pl anned or under construction in Miami now totals 114, most of which are high-rise developments.  That in cludes 61,000 condo units—eight times the number that were built in  the last decade—and a total of  100,000 new park ing spaces.  I know we don’t have any process for introducing exhi bits into the record, but  I’d like to pass Dave Stockton this pictorial of the new projects in Miami, so that he can contin ue to worry a little bit along with me. [Laughter]   My supervision and regula tion staff thinks this is an accide nt waiting to happen  in our area.  And while the local market excesses probably do not represen t systemic national risk, the shakeouts could have serious regional cons equences.  My bank supervisio n staff points out that housing-related credit risks to our bank lenders are not so much from defaults on permanent mortgage financing that we talked about yesterday, but rath er from lending for land acquisition, development, and construction. The ugly picture we have seen before—and th at they think we may very likely see again before long—goes something like th is: the drying up of sales of ne w units; the painfu l decision of           118 of 234developers to go ahead and complete the construction of additional units to make them saleable, further depressing the market; and speculators who had hoped to see big capital gains walking away or defaulting on their contracts, gi ving their properties back to th e lender.  Perhap s it’s because of where I sit, but I am less comf orted than some of my colleagues ab out the housing situation. As for the national economy, my view is that real GDP growth is mo st likely to remain on its recent path, averaging around 3½  percent, which we judge to be very close to trend.  Consumer spending seems to continue to be roughly in line with GDP gr owth, confidence has rebounded, investment spending is st ill supportive, and ma nufacturing has seemed a bit brighter in recent data reports.  I would characterize employment growth  as better than the “improving gradually” language would suggest, and I thin k it should be sufficient to at least keep the un employment rate around current levels or pe rhaps nudge it even lower. I am less sure about the pros pects for underlying inflation.  But given the amount of policy accommodation that remains in  place, and that will re main in place even if we  raise our target rate another 25 basis points today, I believe the inflat ion risks are now on the upside.  While the most recent monthly inflation numbers dippe d a bit, the overall path for the la st year has clearly been up.  And the Greenbook forecast and othe r forecasts of inflation have b een raised for the remainder of this year and into next year.  Until  further evidence is available, th ere is the risk of  putting too much weight on the high-frequency numbers, such as th e May PPI and CPI releases, and losing sight of the longer-run inflation path. Even more important than this , however, is the pres ence of the longer-term  imbalances that we’ve talked about, which increase the risk to the economy.  Most of these are largely beyond our control.  I have in mind here not only the fiscal deficit and the trade situation, but also the continued           119 of 234troubles in our domestic au to industry and, of course, problems in  the airline industry.  Both of these latter problem areas may have undesirable spillover effects to financial markets. It also looks as if higher ener gy prices are here for a while, and this is refl ected in futures prices. Higher energy costs will clearly squeeze energy-dependent bu sinesses first, but I think we’ll also have uncertain trickle-down effects th at can’t be good for other industries.  I’ve already expressed my concer ns about the unstable path of housing in at least some important local markets.  I believe that the least risky policy strategy through these unusual times is to set monetary policy so that it does not contribute to unsustainable activities.  Therefore, I believe that continuing on our recent polic y path for the ne xt few meetings would be  the best course of action. Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Firs t of all, our view regarding the national economy is basically similar to others I have heard here.  We agree with the consensus of GDP growth running about 3½ percent, slightly over ou r potential rate.  And we  see that going forward through the rest of this year and into next year. I also would say that the anecdot al evidence coming from our regi on is very consistent with this above-trend growth rate.  Cons umer spending continues to grow solidly, with retailers reporting that sales were generally above plan and highe r than a year ago thro ugh the first and second        120 of 234quarters.  Tourism continues to ex pand briskly, boosting occupancy ra tes at hotels and resorts in our region. And energy activity remains high. One of the interesting anecdotes  arose during a recent visit I made to the Cessna plant in Wichita, which is booming right now .  They have back orders fo r their jets—general aviation aircraft—running well into 2007, wi th prices running from a mere $2½ million to a little better than $20 million for their Citati on 10, which flies at 0. 8 mach.  And the demand is incred ible.  So the general economic environment reflec ted in these parts of our region really is consistent with a strong growth rate going forward.   On the national inflation outlook, I understand  the arguments given to day for why inflation should continue to ease off.  For that to occur, it is cr itical in my view that we continue to move policy out of its current accommoda tive stance.  If we do n’t, I think we are stimulating demand—I think it’s reflected in some of the other comments here and in some of the anecdotes that I’ve pointed out—and I think we  will have future upward adjustments in inflation as we  move forward.  So I think it is critical that  we get ourselves closer to that neutra l zone that we talk  about, which no one can pinpoint with certa inty but which is probab ly somewhere between 3½ and 4½ percent.  I’ll leave it at that.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  New England continues to expand but probably more slowly than the nati on.  At our last mee ting, I spoke of a coup le of bumps along the road to a stronger regional economy.  Those bumps remain—in part icular, rising concerns about slow job growth, rapidly growing input costs, the strength of demand, and the availability of skilled labor.               121 of 234Moreover, with the base realignment and clos ure (BRAC) proposals by the Pentagon now public, there are clear cha llenges to be faced in both Connecticut and Maine, which together bear about half of the related job losses for the whole na tion.  While there will be extensive efforts in Washington by New England legislators to modify the BRAC resu lts through the work of the BRAC Commission, judging by the outcome of the last four round s of base clos ures, little will change. This will be pa rticularly difficult for Maine, with its smalle r and less di fferentiated economy. And I expect the news  of the MBNA/Bank of America merger won’t go over well in Maine either.  So it’s not hard to see why the general to ne in New England seem s a bit on the soft side.   Employment in our District is growing but at  a slower pace in Ma y than in the three previous months.  Unemployment has edged up, and most other indicators of economic health show only modest growth.  Indeed, business confidence has trended down sharply, and commercial real estate markets remain sluggish across the region. Regional manufacturers—those contacted for the Beige Book , those who sit on our New England Advisory Council, or those who participat e in our economic forums—are for the most part experiencing rising demand and volum e growth.  But they view increases in costs as a particular impediment.  They see the costs of  raw materials of all sorts, incl uding energy and transport, as problems.  And they believe passing on such costs is difficult, except when they have unique or technologically advanced products.  Many talked about margin pressures and, as compared to the last several meetings, fewer talked about pricing po wer.  Perhaps this is because energy surcharges already have been implem ented and accepted but other pricing ch anges are proving more difficult.  Health care costs are a concern as well.  And th e rising costs—or unava ilability of—necessary skilled labor are issues.          122 of 234To end the regional disc ussion on a little more  positive note, there ar e industries that are clearly doing well. As a generic category, the leisure and hospitality industry is grow ing.  Tourism is solid and hotel margins are good.  Retailers are mo re optimistic as well, though the wet weather in facing good demand for their products, and business service firms say that job markets are tightening, especially for technology workers. And I’d have to say that in my  11 years of reading the notes on Be ige Book discussions, I’ve never seen a description of the business outlook qu ite like the one I read in our recent notes, which was, I quote, “Crazy, busting at the seams.”  That  was the case for one very large regional producer of aircraft integrated syst ems.  For this company, demand from the airlines for retrofits and for fuel management and diagnostic systems has ta ken off, literally.  [Laughte r]  So, not everything is growing slowly in New England. Turning to the national scene, there is clear evidence that the economic softening we noted at the last meeting has reve rsed course, at least partially.  The so -called soft patch in the first quarter is in the process of being revised away with the changes to net exports and inventory levels.  And while the second quarter will suffer some from the unwinding of auto inventories, there does seem to be a solid pattern of underlying growth. Looking further ahead, there is very little diffe rence between our forecast  in Boston and that in the Greenbook.  Throu gh late ’05 and into ’06, we continue  to see an evolving handoff from policy-stimulated, consumer-led growth to a soli d pace of underlying demand led by increased business spending that is being driven by relatively sound fundam entals.  Incomi ng data, while bumpy, continued to suggest that this evolution will occur.              123 of 234We, like the Greenbook, see four-quarter growth rates in  both 2005 and 2006 in the mid-threes, unemployment close to the staff’s estimate of full employment, and bo th core CPI and core PCE edging downward.  This isn’t terribly different from our outlook  at the previous meeting.  But while some aspects of th e earlier soft patch have gone away , new or perhaps more sharply drawn risks have emerged.  In particular, oil prices cont inue to surprise on the upside.  This could both dampen growth and contribute more to inflation than we currently  expect.  The baseline forecast sees inflation moderating ov er the next year and a half, but that  assumes that oil prices flatten and don’t continue their upward climb. By the end of the forecast peri od, some slack remains, but ther e are risks on the upside that resource pressures could occur sooner.  Indeed, some compensation measures may be hinting at this, and slowing productivity could also contribu te.  Risks exist on the downside as well, in particular that the drag of higher energy prices will slow worldwide growth even further, working to create greater slack here in the United States. The other major area of risk, as I see it, in volves a wide array of  asset and financial variables.  We’ve discussed whether there is a housing bubble or ju st symptoms of froth in some demographics, low interest rates clearly have been a contributing factor.  They  have also contributed to what most market practitioners view as a sense of reaching for risk in markets and to relatively narrow credit spreads.  The complications of some of the newer, mo re intricate, and untested credit default instruments caused a bit of market turmoil recently .  This was far from a systemic event, but it does I think illustrate the fact that na sty surprises can occur when markets overdo. I found the papers prepared by  Vincent and his colleagues on the conundrum of low 10-year Treasury yields very interesting and very helpful.  I happen to fall into the camp of those who put          124 of 234more credence in the low 10-year yield as a signal of increased financial ease rather than potential economic weakness. But the case for both interpretatio ns I thought was well made. For both these major risks—risi ng oil prices and excesses in asset and financial markets— there are possible downsid e effects on growth  and upside effects on inflat ion and market volatility.  So how should policy react? Or, more pointedly, when should we  pause from our “measured pace” to assess where things are? Given the Greenbook forecast and reasonable as sumptions about remaining slack, one could look at the downside risks and say that a pause shou ld occur sooner rather than later.  But one could also look at the upside risks and decide a pause should come at a later point.  Frankly, I think the latter course is less co stly.  That is, if we err on  the side of tighter policy, easing can be done quickly if it’s necessary—and at little relativ e cost.  Higher rates,  if approached sensib ly and cautiously, will help to wring out of the system some excesses and protect against unexpected su rges in inflation.  If we stay too accommodativ e for too long, then the price of correction in terms of economic growth But, really, pausing is not the question for today.  I think our  best course of action should be to repeat what we’ve done over the last several me etings and move the funds rate up.  I know we’ll have more to say later about the language in the statement, but fo r now let me emph asize once again that I think saying what we did an d why we did it should be enough.  I know ther e will be no desire to change the statement in any fundamental way until  we take a pause or d ecide to move faster.  That may be wise, and it has worked pretty well so far.  But I continue  to believe that there is a risk in continuing to imply that we kn ow more than we do about what the future course of policy will need to be.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher.               125 of 234MR. FISHER.  First, let me say that I’ll es chew any and all sports analogies in my presentation and give it to yo u more or less straight up. The oddity about our District is that we have almost no banks but we have enormous producers for the economy.  For example—and I’m prefaci ng my remarks this way for a purpose— together with the maquil adoras in Mexico we have two million  manufacturing work ers.  We have two of the largest airline companie s.  We have some of the larges t railroads.  We have Dell, Texas Instruments, EDS, and so on.  An d I have assiduously been calling around and talking to the CEOs of those companies in order to get a feel not only about developments in our District but also in the national economy.  And this  is my report to you. First of all, Mr. Chairman, our District lagged the nation in re covery and really didn’t come out of the recession until 2003.  We are now growi ng on pace with the nati onal economy, at a rate of around 3½ percent plus.  That’s the good news.  On the price front, obviously, th ere have been increases in the price of oil—and we do have some major oil companies and oil pro ducers.  But other than in oil, oil field workers’ wages, prices of ranch land that may have mineral rights, and in  health care, we see no  evidence of the price pressures and pricing power that we’ve talked about before.   I’ve taken some liberties, and with my colleague’s permission  I’ve talked to a neighbor to the north who is an officer of the nation’s largest retailer—Wal-Ma rt.  The COO, whom I used to advise in my previous capacity, and I had a co nversation two days ago and I was struck by his statement that “We’ve been surprise d at the lack of inflation across the store.”  It’s a rather large store, I might add.  He indicat ed that the dynamics of the wo rld economy are exerting downward price pressures, still to this day—deflating prices in electronics, clot hing, and almo st all retail sectors. There is one exception, which is a 4.6 percent price increase in diapers.  But other than that,      126 of 234my contact noted that they  were having trouble making any price moves other than in a flat to down direction.  This was confirmed by the CEO of  Penney’s.  It’s a different pr ice point.  They have about a 46 percent overlap with Wal-Mart.  But in hous ehold furnishings and apparel—again, there are concerns driven by Chinese produc tion levels—they are tryi ng to make up in volume for what they see as continued downward pr essure on prices.  This  is despite the existen ce of quotas in certain areas. And, in fact, my contact pointed out that th ey are forecasting that su ch pressure will continue for several years to come. In terms of residential construction, as I mentio ned yesterday, I talked to someone at one of the nation’s largest homebuilders—a builder of 20,000 homes who has about $6 b illion a year in revenue.  Interestingly, with co nstruction costs—the cost of mate rials: plumbing, furnishings, and fixtures—there is continued price deflation.  Agai n, that is based on imports coming into the United States. The two areas where they  do see constant pr ices—cement and lumber —Mr. Chairman, are largely due to trade restri ctions; lumber sales from Canada and cement sales from Mexico are being restricted by tradin g arrangements.   The largest paper product compan y, Kimberly-Clark, is in our District.  Interestingly, its CEO reported only one prod uct line where they  feel the ability to pass on costs based on energy prices, which again was the diaper ma rket.  That has been the subject of quite a lot of discussion in our District!  [Laughter]  The story is different for prices of paper-based hospital products, which constitute a growing ma rket because of linens be ing unsanitary.  They have  a labor component; and because of the labor co mponent from China, the Philippines, Estonia, and else where, there is continued price deflation.        127 of 234  Our contacts in the chemical industry, which is  substantial in our District, report that they cannot pass on price increases and have no prici ng power.  In the IT [information technology] sector, our sources at Dell, TI, and EDS say that hardware and te lecom costs continue downward.  And India has begun to exer t an effect that is  keeping a price ceiling on software costs.  As for the shippers, I spoke with CEOs of th ree shippers—one again a former client in another District—and they report that they see growth “a tad bit slower .”  They are constraine d by competition from DHL and the U.S. Postal Servic e and by their inability to pass on cost increases ot her than standard fuel surcharges.   The CEO of the largest railroad in our area reports soft patche s in the economy.  He noted particularly that growth in shipments for trans-Pacific trade has slowed to th e high single digits from significant double digits.  Most notably, by the way, this is occurri ng in steel where prices have come off dramatically. Most interesting of all were th e discussions we’ve had with shi ppers.  I previously served on a Norwegian shipping board—got off at just the right time—but have  used those contacts to get a better understanding of the shipping industry.  An d I think here are some interesting data:  Other than the category of LNG tankers, which was covered by the Financial Times adequately this morning, the Baltic Dry Inde x, for example, has been  dropping dramatically.  In fact, the cost of shipping at one point, as you reme mber, exceeded the cost  of goods shipped.  Last year, it cost $100,000 a day to charter a ship to carry iron or e for the manufacture of steel—as we saw in the charts—from either Brazil or India to China.  Now the co st is $31,000.   But here is the clincher.  Chin a has entered the shipbuilding busin ess in a dramatic way.  It currently accounts for 14 percen t of the shipbuilding market; 40 pe rcent is produced by Korea and 32 percent by Japan.  China will do uble its shipbuilding capacity in th e next five years, and the data      128 of 234show that an additional 60 percen t of the existing container fleet and 27 percent of  the existing tanker fleet will come on stream in the next three to four years.   Needless to say, there is no pricing power in shipping. So in summary, Mr. Chairman, while the Eleventh  District has caught up with the nation,  soundings in our District and na tionally indicate no pricing power .  And I detect a slight, but noticeable, shift among the people we speak with to ward concerns about sl ower growth and away from concerns about in flation.  Thank you.

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Business activit y in the Fourth District has not changed very much du ring the intermeeting period.  Business conditions in the region are okay, but not great.  Many of the business  contacts I talked to report that  their business is better in other parts of the country th an in our District. Recent credit downgrades of debt issued by  GM, Ford, and some of  their suppliers have received a lot of attention in the District.  Longer term, companies in the automobile supply chain are bracing for consolidation, as Ford, Daimler-Chry sler, and GM grapple with  their cost structures. My District, though, has a number of  Honda and Toyota plan ts and suppliers to th ose plants.  So the longer-term adjustments in the Distri ct are not likely to be quite as severe as in other parts of the Midwest.  Nevertheless, the Fourth  District companies that sell to the automobile supply chain are not optimistic about the sales an d profitability outlook fo r that sector.  One banker I talked to confirmed that his customers in th e automotive supply chain have be come very cautio us about their investment spending recently.   At the time of our last meetin g, my greatest concern was that the pace of real economic activity might slow an d that the pace of core inflation migh t pick up.  As it turns out, economic             129 of 234growth has held up fairly  well and inflation has he ld fairly steady.  Nevert heless, I’m not feeling any more confident or certain about the outlook—especially the outlook for inflation—than I was in I approached this meeting thinking about inflation in th e same way that David Wilcox did in his presentation.  The Green book baseline projection fo r core PCE is close to 2 percent for nearly all of this year and next year and on ly very slowly returns to my pref erred rate of 1½ percent.  And I find this long time frame to be discouraging.  Even more discouraging is the prospect that inflation could very well turn out to be great er than that baseline projection. As David pointed out in his exhibit 6, in ear ly 2004 the Greenbook baseline projection called for core PCE to incr ease over the four quarters of 2005 at a rate of 1 percent.   By the end of last year, that was moved up to 1½ percent.  Then over the past six months of this year it has been moved up another ½ percentage point to 2 percen t.  I’m not repeating these numbers to cast aspersions on the staff projections because, after all, when they were made I thought those were very reasonable projections and I agreed with them.  As a group, we reported to Congress in and the same for next year .  And, as Steve pointed out this morning, in our preliminary numbers, the projection for core PCE has been  moved up to 1¾ to 2 percen t for this year and next.  I know that I have consistently underestimated inflation.  And now we’re facing oil prices of close to $60 per barrel and there is a risk, I believ e, that unit labor costs could trend up.  Assuming that the real side of the econom y does hold up, the potential infl ationary consequences of these developments give me second thoughts about paus ing too soon in our removal of policy accommodation.  But I’ll hold my comments on policy fo r later on in the meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.            130 of 234CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  Anecdotes from our directors and others, incoming data on the regional and national economie s, and the results from running our forecasting models all appear to me to be co nsistent with real GDP growth of  3 percent or more.  Personally, like many others, I expect growth of around 3½ percent—the kind of expansion we have been experiencing. I’ve been struck most recently, as I reviewed the latest anecdotes and the incoming evidence on the economy, by the bread th of the positive repo rts, though of course much of what we have been seeing is a continuation of  what has been going on for some  time.  So I’ll just cover the positive things very, very quickly: sustained st rength in home prices, sales, and residential construction activity; inci pient improvement in nonresidential construction activity; expansion in manufacturing in the aggregate; moderate gains in employment; co ntinuing increase s in consumer spending; and a positive situation w ith regard to cap ital spending.   As Sandy Pianalto just noted, there are pa rts of our economy—what  I guess I would call “old industrial America”—such as domestically owned automobile  producers and their suppliers, and though not industrial, the hub- and-spoke airlines, where there are lots of problems .  But it seems to me that the forecasts adequately allow for those circumstance s already.  So, to  me, the economy and the economic expansion appear  to be on solid footing.  As to inflation, I ha ve not changed my forecast, bu t I must admit I am a little less comfortable about the situation than I was former ly.  That’s partly beca use we’ve gotten a little more inflation this year and last year than I had earlier anticipated.  But also, as I li stened to Dave Wilcox’s attribution analysis, I got a little nervous.  I’ve had a lot of  experience doing those kinds of things, and one can always parse the numbers that way.   What I think it misses from time to time is         131 of 234the underlying dyna mics or interactions  of the price performance.  So I’m a little mo re concerned than I was formerly that inflation, if not tilted to the upside, is at least getting locked in at a somewhat higher rate. Having said all of that, it seems to me that as far as policy is concerned we have been on the appropriate course and we should continue on that course.  I think the policy implications are really rather straightforward.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Yellen. 

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  At our last FOMC meetin g, I worried about a slowdown in growth and a pickup in inflation.  I hypo thesized and ho ped that both would prove transitory.  On the whole,  I consider recent data reassuring that  the soft patch in the spring was just that—maybe not even that—and not a prec ursor of a more en trenched slowdown. While the Greenbook subs cribes to the view that the slow down in growth wa s transitory, the staff has made an upward revision, by a couple of tenths, to its fo recast for core PCE inflation for this year and next year, now projecting inflation of  about 2 percent in both years.  I’m a bit less pessimistic on inflation than the staff.  Recent data  on core inflation have been  pretty good of late.  Moreover, I see the fundam entals—namely, the pressures on futu re inflation—as providing room on balance for some optimism.  The most worrisome factor is that oil prices have risen further, although this should tend to boost core inflation more this year than next year. As David noted, the recent jump in compensa tion per hour should probably be discounted, since it appears to be due to on e-time factors.  On the encouraging side, I see a noticeable decline— about 17 basis points—in in flation compensation  at both the 5- and 10-year  horizons, high markups, an appreciation in the dollar, a le veling off of commodity prices, ve ry modest increases in the ECI, still rather robust structural pr oductivity growth, a nd some indi cations of remaining slack.          132 of 234The situation with regard to slack, as David noted and emphas ized, is complicated because the unemployment rate is relatively low, near most estimates of NAIR U.  But several other measures, as he pointed out and as we also routinely monitor—including the employment-to­population  ratio, capacity utilizat ion, the output gap, an d the other indicators that David showed us— do sugges t that slack remains.  One final point on the inflation ou tlook is that one of the best forecasters of future inflation is past inflation.  And I’m told that this is a point that was emphasized at a special topic session a couple of years ago. On  this score, things  look fairly good, with core  PCE price inflation at 1.7 percent over the past 12 months. While I guess I can and have quibbled a bit about the inflation outlook for the next year, overall I think the Greenbook forecast seems reason able.  Real GDP appears poised to grow just slightly above its poten tial rate, gradually elimin ating remaining slack.  And core inflation, while currently near the upper e nd of my comfort zone, at least to me  seems likely to moderate a bit over the next few years. The Greenbook forecast depicts an almost textbook scenario of an economy continuing along the path toward a rather attractive steady state.  Going forward, there are obviously some sizable risks, and I count the un winding of possible house and bond  market bubbles as one or two that are high on my list.  But I think the most likely outcome is—as in the Greenbook projection— that we will continue to  move in a positive directi on over the next couple of years.  And given what we now know, I think the funds ra te path assumed in the Greenbook , which is very close to the times before slowing the pace of tightening rather substantially.  And I want to emphasize that, in my view, the well-calibrate d monetary policy we’ve had has played  an important role in keeping the             133 of 234economy moving along this textbo ok path during a peri od characterized by some quite difficult circumstances. I know that Monday’s pre-FOMC briefing emphasized that economi c activity has been burdened by some major drags over the past year  or so.  These includ e the oil shock, the deterioration in the trad e balance, and the still lo w level of investment sp ending relative  to GDP.  The result is that we’ve had to keep interest rates exceptionally low for a long time, just to get respectable economic growth.  In fa ct, respectable and not stellar grow th is all we have gotten, even with exceptionally low long-term yields and unexp ectedly rapid gains in ho use prices.  And those are two factors that, on their own,  would be working to push up th e equilibrium real  funds rate.  So the merely respectable growth in the economy has really rest ed on the backs of just a few interest rate-sensitive sectors:  business investment, consumer du rables, and housing.  From that perspective, it’s really not all that  surprising that house prices ha ve risen a great deal, and it’s not surprising to hear our directors and other contac ts comment that liquidity  is abundant and that lending is taking place for deals th at one of our directors simply characterized as “stupid.”  I think he meant by historical standards.  [Laughter]  My point is that to offset th e drags, we’ve needed to give the economy a strong  dose of stimulus, which inevitably boosted the housing sector—and that just to get reasonable ec onomic growth.  That is equivalent to saying that the equilibrium real fed funds rate is unusually  low—1.4 percent in the Greenbook path.  So, for me, the policy imperative that follows is that we need to be car eful not to overdo the pace of policy tightening.  I note d that in recent months several FOMC members have commented that we usually know we’ve come to the end of the tight ening phase when we have tightened one or two times too many.  I think we should be especially attentive to this concern this time around, because the expansion does depend so heavily on just a couple of interest-s ensitive sectors.  And              134 of 234John Williams’s analysis ye sterday highlighted  the fact that if house and/or bond pr ices fall, the zero bound could become an issue we would be discussing again.   To conclude, I’m all for raising the funds rate by 25 basis po ints at this meeting, and I believe the language in the press release should seek to maintain the path for the expected fed funds rate that now exists in th e market.  My worry is that  unless we’re careful in crafting the language as we raise the rate today—and likely again in August—markets will star t to build in more increases in subsequent months than they have so far.  I think we are nearing the point when we will need to start pausing, and I hope we can maintain that expecta tion in the mark et in the peri od ahead.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to start by saying that I thought the staff presentation was very comprehensiv e and very sound, including the di scussion of risks and standard errors. So I congratulate the st aff on a very fine job there. Let me just summarize very quickly key anecdotal  information that I have  gathered.  First of all, my sense from my contacts is that the real economy is growing modera tely, continuing the growth of about the past year or so.  Second, labor supply  of hourly workers is plentiful.  There are lots of anecdotes of that type , but a dramatic example is a new Wal-Mart store opening in San Diego, where there were 10,000 applicants for 400 jobs.  That’s  a very typical story; the margin contacts in the transporta tion industry.  The only exception there seems to  be truck drivers, a position for which qualified applicants seem to be in chronic short supply.  Third, managerial and technical skills are beco ming in somewhat shor t supply.  A contact with a major software company told me that their outsourcing to India was actually more a matter of the supply of those sk ills—with many of th em just not readily availabl e in the United States—rather          135 of 234than the cost. This is, I’m sure, for standard sort s of software code writing.  Another item in that vein is that later this year we  could see a strike of UPS and FedEx pilots.  There are ongoing negotiations.  The contract expi red some time ago, or at least became available for a reopening some time ago.  And the pilots  apparently are quite far apart from the comp anies in those negotiations. Fourth, I don’t think there’s any doubt that energy pr ices are having a si gnificant effect on the purchasing power of, let’s say, the lower half of the income di stribution.  Wal-Mart has been talking about that fo r some time in terms of th eir same-store sales.  But another very interesting Wal-Mart anecdote was that they ’ve observed among their own em ployees a reduction in health care utilization—that is, fewer doctors’ visits—but an increase in em ergency room visits.  Apparently employees are strugglin g some to make the co-payments and that kind of thing, again emphasizing the stress that  exists in many lower-income households.  Th at’s where I’ll stop.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ec onomic activity in the Fifth District advanced moderately in May and J une.  The survey results we released earlier  this week showed that manufacturing shipments edged higher and that revenues of service firm s grew somewhat more quickly this month.  New orders in manufacturing seemed to sl ip this month, however.  Growth in retail sales moderated in June, as our big ticket sa les index contracted sli ghtly after having moved sharply higher in May.  District  housing markets remain ed fairly hot—maybe not as hot as Miami, but fairly hot.  Home sales continued at high levels.  Bids above  asking prices were common in popular locations.  Markets for b each properties and for condos in downtown areas are especially strong. Business optimism  seems to be hold ing up.  Survey respondents expect the pace of demand           136 of 234growth to pick up over the next six months.  Our contacts also expe ct an upturn in capital spending growth over that period, and price pressu res in the District remain contained. Indications are that the national economy cont inues to perform well , although concerns about the housing market and en ergy prices are causing jitters  in some quarters about the sustainability of the expa nsion.  Average net jo b growth for the three months endi ng in May exceeded 150,000 per month—a rate  sufficient to keep up the st eady improvement in labor markets we’ve seen since last year.  An d the Greenbook expect s real GDP to average above 3½ percent through the end of 2006, slightly faster than potential. To me, the most striking revi sion in the June Greenbook was the 0.2 increase in the projected path for core PCE inflation through 200 6.  Expected inflation is  now 2.1 perc ent for ’05 and 1.9 percent for ’06. I found this revision st riking, because 2 percent is the upper limit of my own comfort zone for core  PCE inflation.  Moreover, market pa rticipants are aware that the core PCE index is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.  And if we allow it to drift much above 2 percent, we run the risk of unhi nging longer-run inflation expecta tions, especially if energy prices spike up further as well. Having said that, I take heart from the fact that inflation expectations have fallen somewhat in the past couple of months.  TIPS inflation compensation, both  near-term and longer-run, has continued to decline even in the f ace of climbing oil prices.  Of c ourse, inflation expectations build in beliefs about our future behavior.  I read declining inflation comp ensation, along with the apparent fall in inflat ion uncertainty for which Vincent’s staff apparently finds evidence, as implying that markets expect us  to do whatever is necessary to  hold the line on inflation.   I see three main risks to the outlook.  First, with oil markets as tight as they are, the world economy is obviously vulnerable to a supply disruption that co uld send prices significantly higher.                137 of 234Second, we’ve been anticipating a ha ndoff from housing inve stment to business investment over the course of this recovery.  While business investment has continued to pick up, the demand for new capital appears to be limite d now by the rate at which firms expect their output to grow.  So the potential problem is that businesses may be reluctan t to pick up more slac k before they see that housing is headed for a soft landin g.  Yet that reluctance would in terfere with or impede a smooth handoff, making it more difficult to achieve.  Third, I find myself worrying about the possibility of an inflation scare in the bond market, despite the recent decline in TIPS sp reads.  It’s not clear how likely  this is, but if  it happened, it would be very costly .  A spike in long-term yields could be particularly harmful today for elevated housing prices.  It would raise long-term mortgage  rates directly, obviously.  Moreover, it would force us to raise short-term real rates.  And in such circumstances I think it would be even harder for us to facilitate this hand off of investment from th e housing sector to the bu siness sector without an intervening recessi on.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you. We’re somewhat more confident in the strength and sustainability of the expansion than we were  in May.  Our view is  very similar to the staff forecast. We expect real GDP growth to average roughly 3½ percent over the forecast period.  We expect core PCE to follow a somewhat higher path and to end the forecast period slightly higher than we expected in May, at just under 2 percent.  This forecast assumes that we’ll continue to tighten monetary policy, perhaps by a bit more than foreseen in the staff forecast and than is curre ntly priced into the market.  To us, the risks to this forecast seem roughly balanced .  We see no new sources of pote ntial risk.  This  is not to say that the usual sources of uncertainty and the us ual candidates for a negative surprise are not           138 of 234daunting. It’s worth not ing, though, that these ri sks—from a cliff in hous ing prices to a sharp increase in household saving, to a larger and more  sustained oil shock, to less favorable future productivity outcomes, to a sharp increase in risk premia  or to declines in asset prices—in general are risks that we can’t really  mitigate substantially ex ante through monetary policy. However, by making sure we ge t the real fed funds rate up to a more comfortable level we can help.  The alternative strategy, to oversimplify it, would be to follow a softer path for monetary policy to provide a preemptive cushion against the negative effects on employment of a fall in housing prices, a rise in risk premia, some rise in saving and a fall in cons umption, and so forth.  This would, I believe, be  a less prudent strategy. Although there have been pers istent concerns about the vulnerability of this expansion and about some of its le ss robust characteristics, the two most re markable aspects of this recovery are encouraging. The first is its resilience.  So far, each episode of incipient so ftness has proved to be shallow in depth and short in duration.  Despite very prol onged and substantial headwinds in the context of an oil shock, a large ongoing drag from net exports, a significant tightening of financial conditions, a modest withdr awal of fiscal stimulus , etc., quarterly GDP gr owth—as Janet said— has shown impressive stability ar ound a 3½ percent annual ra te over the last year an d a half.  And this is a dramatic reduction  in realized macr oeconomic volatility.  It make s the much-heralded “great moderation” look turbulent.  The second positive featur e of this period has been the beha vior of underlying inflation and inflation expectations.  Of cour se, underlying inflatio n seems to have moved up a bit, but large changes in oil and commodity pri ces and import prices have pr oduced periods of substantial acceleration in headline inflation without, at least to this point, causing more than short-lived upward moves in core inflatio n or inflation expectations.          139 of 234The behavior of productivity growth and expe ctations about future productivity growth explain some of this. Also importa nt, of course, is the credibility engendered by th e record of the FOMC.  Changes in the stru cture of the financial system must ma tter, too.  There are almost surely other factors—luck for one—that are at work. Among the choices in Vincent Rein hart’s note on interest rates,  I’m inclined to support the more benign assessment of the recent behavior of  forward interest rates and term premia, even though these factors can’ t fully explain those moves, and even though the future may prove to be more volatile and adverse than th e markets now seem to expect an d than those explanations would imply.   So what about monetary policy going forward?   There are two salient dimensions of the forecast. One, of course, is gr owth slightly above tr end from a starting point where the remaining amount of resource slack, if any, is substantially diminished.  The other is an underlying inflation rate—just to focus on the core PCE—that now seems to be runnin g at a modest ma rgin above 1.5 percent and that we expect w ill end the forecast period above 1.5 percent.  And inflation expectations, at the horizon over  which monetary policy operates and with re asonable adjustments to translate them into a view on the PCE deflat or, are still some margin above 1.5 percent.   We don’t consider this inflatio n forecast a cause for serious concern.  We anticipate upward pressures on inflation from some firming of compensation growth an d from higher unit labor costs.  We expect those pressure s will face the counterva iling forces of relative ly moderate inflation expectations, strong competitive pr essures, still substan tial profit margins, the potential for some increase in the labor force participation rate, and pretty strong expe cted future productivity growth. And yet it should matter to us that, even in a world where th e nominal fed funds rate peaks at 4 percent, models envision a relatively extende d period during which the core PCE deflator stays             140 of 234meaningfully above 1.5 percent.  The range of estimates in the fo recasts and model simulations before us, and the expectations we can derive from the market, place th e terminal rate of the nominal fed funds rate now betw een 3½ and 4½ or between 3¾ an d perhaps 4¼ percent.  These estimates have moved down a bit over  the last few months, but the sh ape of the path has steepened a bit. I don’t think we really know  how much confidence we can have in these estimates, even if the forecast unfolds as we expect to day.  But my view remains that we are better off following a path that would put us at the higher end of these estimates than in taking th e risk of doing too little and stopping prematurely or trying to manage the co mmunication challenges of a temporary pause when we still believe we  have further to go.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The issues before  us at this me eting are two.  The first is: Are we going to be dissuaded from the anno unced strategy of anot her modest tightening in monetary policy?  And second: Is there palpable  need to adjust market  expectations of policy going forward? We might be dissuaded, or feel obliged to ch ange market expectatio ns under one of four circumstances; and I will go throug h each of them in orde r.  The first is if we thought the baseline forecast itself, which I think is built basically around the announced strate gy, was unacceptable.  I find the baseline forecast basically  acceptable, although I am somewh at concerned, as are President Lacker and a few others who have already spoken, that the inflation drift seems to be  upward.  So I think there is some risk ther e, but by and larg e it’s basically an acceptable forecast. The second reason I think we would change strategy or change policy in terms of our announcements is if the incoming data made a basi cally acceptable forecast seem highly unlikely.  And here I’d say that the incoming  data, at least on the real side of the economy, are pretty much        141 of 234consistent with the baseline fore cast.  Consumption is likely to hold up well, as outlined in the baseline, because labor markets do appear to be gradually improving .  As David Wilcox indicated, not only has the un employment rate edge d down a little but, more importantly fr om my standpoint, the broader indicators of labor market conditions seem  to be consistent with improv ement.  Economic conditions have strengthened enough  to bring some individuals back into the labor market, as evidenced by a gradual rise in th e labor force participation rate.  There is also a in the chart show as well.  And I think the tone in the surv ey data from both businesses and households has been relatively positive.  Moreover, I continue to believe that low interest rates are likely to support wealth creation in the housing mark et, as we discussed extensively yesterday, and I have very little concern a bout a sudden fall-off in th at regard.  And, finally, with respect to business fixed investment, I would say thou gh the investment-to-GDP ratio has been relatively low—a point I will return to late r—I agree with the assessme nt in the Greenbook that the fundamenta ls are at least consistent with ongoing business fixed investment.   On the inflation side, I would say that David handled the incoming data  well in terms of why one should not put too much wei ght on some of the data.  The one point that he didn’t touch on was unit labor costs.  They rose quite dramatically in the fourth quarter of last year, but I think the good news is that in the first quar ter of this year the increase in uni t labor costs on an annual basis, quarter over quarter, seems to have subsided somewh at.  So there may be less inflation pressures in that regard. So by and large, in  terms of the second re ason, I’d say the incoming data are consistent with a pretty go od outlook.   The third reason that mi ght force us to change our views is if the market signals indicate that our read of the economy is likely to be flawed.  And here, as others have indicate d, the work that        142 of 234Vincent and the staff have done I think firmly outlines at least so me of the issues.  The fixed-income conundrum has been much recognized.  Additionally, risk premia  in the fixed-income universe are also quite low. In the equity markets, I think the signals are somewhat contradictory.  And here I pick up a little from exhi bit 8.  One thing that’s  not shown there is that  the implied share price volatilities of both Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are really quite low, and yet the risk equity premium is relatively wide—toward the wide end of the norm that we’ve seen over  the last decade.  So in lieu of decrying these co nundra with which we are confronted, let me at least do what Michael wouldn’t do, which is venture a hypothesis on why some of these things are true. With respect to the fixed-in come markets, I ha ve reached the conclusion—from these various observations of low rates and the flat yield curve—that th e explanation probably relates to the fact that, at the global leve l, domestic absorption  has fallen.  I’m not  trying to sort out investment versus consumption.  Overall I think it ha s fallen below what it would have been otherwise.  This suggests to me a fall in the neutral rate, not a global slowdown—to cite the two choices that were in Vincent’s mo del.  I am heavily persuaded by the work that we  saw on Monday, which Janet mentioned, about the nu mber of real-side factors that may be holding back the economy and therefore reducing the neutral rate.  I’d also say that the investment-GDP ratio, wh ich has been quite low, has fed into fixed-income market perfor mance because it has led to a change in the corporate financing gap.  Between 1991 and 2000, the financin g gap rose from less th an $35 billion to a peak of more than $300 billion. That rise reflected the very sharp in crease in capital expenditures that we saw and have talked a great deal about in the telecom, high-tech,  and transportation sectors,  etc.  But the important thing is that the financing gap fell  abruptly in 2001 an d 2002, turned negative  in 2003, and stayed negative until the four th quarter of last year.  Due to the Microsoft dividend and the expiration of the       143 of 234accelerated tax depreciation, the financing gap returned to slightly positive territory in the first quarter.  But overall the negative financing gap, which has been widespread acro ss industries, indicates to me that the business sector as a w hole is generating enough ca sh to purchase capital expenditures without borrowing. It is also true that the dividend payout ratio  has been relatively low.  The dividend payout ratio as a percentage of S&P operating earnings tu rns out to be, based on a report that I’ve just received, about 29 percent versus th e 48 to 50 percent it has averaged over the last 40  years or so.  So it’s clear that corporations are really sort of hoarding this cash.  Since corporations do not tend to invest in equ ities, they do tend to invest in a number of fixed-income securities relatively short term.  I think that’s one of the things that have been driving these relatively low interest rates.   And just to put a final point on that, since the beginning of 2003, liquid assets in the nonfin ancial corporate s ector rose from about $310 billion, or more than 30 percent, to a total of $1 .3 trillion.  While the rate  of accumulation of liquid assets has slowed, I think the ratio is still a factor th at has been driving this re latively low interest rate. In equity markets, my read of  the data is that the low volatility is telling us a better story than the rise in the equity risk premium we’ve seen.  As Steve pointed out, or at least implied, the earnings-price ratio part of the equity risk prem ium really hasn’t change d very much over long periods of time. It is still  in the 5½ to 6 perc ent range.  So it r eally is the fixed-in come side that has been driving the slight widening  of the equity risk premium. The final market signal that I think would be impo rtant to us is the read  on interest rates.  Some people have already talked about the interest rate signals we’ve seen.  I won’t belabor the issue. I will pick up a point that Janet made , which is that there are a number of different measures of inflation that come not just from the markets but from others.  Ou r Greenbook turns out to be one              144 of 234of the best forecasters of inflatio n.  It’s not the only reasonably good one.  From the Philadelphia Federal Reserve District, for example, the survey of professional ec onomists also has a fairly good track record on forecasting inflatio n.  And as Janet pointed out, a random walk—or at  least looking back to recent inflation history—has been a good fore caster.  The good news fo r us is that almost all of those forecasts fa ll in a range that’s very close to the Greenbook forecast, which gives us perhaps some comfort that the Greenbook has the forecast on inflation about right.  The final point I’d make—if you remember, th ere were four reasons—is:  Would we be dissuaded from raising rates or would we change the signal if we thought it would create some financial instability?  In this rega rd, I asked the staff to do a very quick simulatio n of the effect of a rapid 1 percentage point rise in the fed funds rate over what is in the Gree nbook forecast.  It turns out that if we were to be so rash as to dramat ically raise rates by 1 percentage poin t over the baseline forecast, that wo uld create by the end of 2006 a rise in the financial obligation ratio of only about 6 basis points.  I wo n’t go through all the math of it, but obviously it has a fair amount to do with the fact that a vast majority of the mortgage s in this country are fixe d-rate mortgages.  And second, by definition, if we were to raise rates so  dramatically that it would result in a slowing in the economy, we would see individuals ta ke on less debt.  But the bottom line is that I think the strategy we’ve outlined, if execut ed in a reasonable fashion, shoul d not create financ ial instability. Let me conclude by saying that I think the stra tegy we have is about right.  I don’t believe there’s a reason to change  market expectations quite dramatically.  I do think there’s some downward pressure on the neutral rate, and I think the Greenbook has picked that up.  So, by and large, I think the appropriate course is full steam ahead.  Th ank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn.         145 of 234MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  I made only small revisions to my forecast from last January.  We’ve seen some no table fluctuations in data and se ntiment over the la st five months, but basically I think we’ve ended up pretty close to where we started, with pr ospects for growth that are close to the growth rate of po tential, perhaps a bit ab ove, and core PCE inflation stable at a little over its rate of last year.  The data we received over th e intermeeting period reinforc ed this favorable outlook, assuaging some of the con cerns on both the demand and inflation fronts that I had at our meeting in early May.  Growth in pr ivate final purchases has been good, with the seco nd-quarter forecast to be around 4 percent.  Slack in labor  markets has continued to erode gradually.  Core CPI inflation slowed, supporting the notion that some of the earlier pickup was a product of the pass-through of previous increases in energy and other import prices, and core PCE inflation has been stable.  Commodity and inte rmediate goods price pressures have abated, consistent with the moderate pace of increase in production and a judgment that  the global economy was not facing significant bottlenecks, except possibl y in energy markets.  A nd importantly, inflation expectations fell on balance despite the further increase in oil prices.  Th e recent further rise in oil prices w ill indeed put some upward pressure on core inflation, but that  should be limite d in time, and in creases in the prices of other imports should abate considerab ly, owing to the strength of the dollar. Moreover, the behavior of most measures of labor compensation sugges ts to me that labor other prices aren’t likely to  become embedded in persistently higher inflation.          146 of 234Over time, of course, it is ap propriate monetary po licy that will keep the balance between demand and potential supply  and inflation in check, and I actua lly found that thinking about the appropriate path for policy was hard er than thinking about the outlook. In a fundamental sense, the favorable outlook rest s on a judgment that ov er the last year or so monetary policy has be en well calibrated to the evolving situation.  Market participants seem comfortable with policy to date an d with their expectatio ns for the future.  Th e simultaneous decline in expected funds rates and inflation expectations over the intermeeting peri od indicates confidence that inflation will be contained.  And the ri se in equity prices and still fairly narrow  risk premiums in credit markets must rest on expectat ions of continued solid growth.  I think we can be fairly  confident that appropriate policy is likely to require additional tightening even beyond this meeting.  That’s what is  built into the yield curv e, and that structure of rates seems to be co nsistent with growth cont inuing around or perhaps a little above the rate of potential and with the output gap about disapp earing.  And with output probably close to its sustainable potential and inflation already having pick ed up a little, I agree with the rest of you that we’re at a point in the cycle at which we need to be especially careful about keeping inflation pressures contained. But how much  further we need to tighten in order to accomplish that, and at what pace, are the in teresting questions. The staff and markets have built in  a leveling out of the funds rate at about 3¾ to 4 percent.  That’s quite low by historical standards.   The Greenbook has an implied short-run r* of only 1½ percent. Still, that’s not implausible, judging fr om the experience of the la st few years when very accommodative policy has been associated with growth only mode rately in exces s of potential. And the recent downward revisions to market expectations for grow th abroad—and expected policy paths abroad—reinforce the possib ility that low equilibri um rates appropriatel y reflect weak global                147 of 234demand.  Nonetheless, th e underlying truth is that we really  don’t know how much we need to tighten, and, fortunately, we don’ t need to figure that out today. I recognize that the 25-basis-poi nts-per-meeting path is not an  optimum policy.  As we can see from the Bluebook simulations, an  optimum policy would tend to fl atten out the trajectory as we get close to what we think is a st opping point.  The risk is that the 25-basis-points-per-meeting pace will tend to ratify your  prediction, Mr. Chairman, that our last tightening will be one too many. Given the lags in the effects of policy, if we wait to see confirmi ng signs that past increases have slowed growth on a sustainable basis—and we aren ’t seeing just another soft patch—we probably will indeed have overshot the mark .  The path could be especially problematic if it extends into the fall when our meetings get closer together.  Surely, the pace of tig htening shouldn’t be dictated by the meeting schedule rather than ec onomic needs.  But I do take some comfort in the expectation that policy doesn’t have to be that precise.  The market will tend to compensate for any overshooting by building in a reve rsal, provided we let it  know that we are op en to that possibility when the time comes. For now, sticking to our path of gradual rate increases w ould seem to be the most prudent course, but such a path is conditional on the economy following its expected path.  We should be willing to deviate either way, even as early as August, should the data in dicate a very substantial deviation in the path of spending or prices.  And our statement toda y should not be read as implying anything about our expectations be yond August.  That will depend on  data.  The higher we go with rates, the more we need to keep an open mind about stopping pl aces and possibly even the pace of tightening. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies.              148 of 234MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought I’d focus my remarks today on the topic we discussed yester day—the housing markets.  An d then I’d like to talk a little bit about some of the liquidity issues in housing markets a nd relate that to monetary policy.  Let me start by saying that overall I agree th at there is not a major risk of significant problems in the housing markets.   But there is momentum buildi ng in the housing area that is raising some issues about which I am not as sanguine as many of the staff who gave the presentations yesterday.  But I wa nt to compliment the staff from both the Board and the Reserve Banks.  I thought they did a fantastic job in pulling all of  the informat ion together While inflation overall is apparently well contained, I, too, am generally concerned about the continued ratcheting up of our ex pectations.  The one th ing that stands out is how much housing prices have jumped relative to overall price leve ls.  We know that the av erage price for new homes in May was up 8 percent from a year  ago.  Existing home prices were up 10.2 percent, as was said yesterday.  But inventories remain relatively lean, even though the supply has risen by about half a month since the beginning of the year. When I look at the ju mp in housing prices, I’m trying to  see if consumers are saying, “We have good, strong income growth and we’re able to  afford more.”  Or are they seeing these price increases and trying to jump in wh ile they still can afford  a house, before home prices get totally out of their range?  Are they viewing real estate as an alternative for investment purposes, after being stung in the stock market drop of a few years ago?  Really , all of these factors ma y be at the heart of the strong demand for housing.   But I also think that the financing markets are sending different signals in these areas.  I know Mark is going to talk about some of the specifics but I want to discuss some of the macro aspects of this.  When the refinancing boom got started about  three years ago, mostly we saw    149 of 234customers going to banks to refinance and take advant age of low, long-term fixe d interest rates.  So most of the mortgage originations  in the 2001-2002 period were pr edominantly fixed- rate loans or they were ARMs that had fairly long fixed-rate periods before becoming adjustable.  What is striking is how this has been changing in the last  12 months.  ARMs of all types have jumped from about 16 percent of originations  in 2001 to about one- fourth in 2002 and 20 03, to over half of mortgage originations last year.  This is happenin g in a period when short rates are rising and long rates are flat to down.  If banker s are really working to the benefi t of their customers, why aren’t they locking in long rates in this environment?   It is also the case, when we look at the mix of products, that more of the mortgages are subprime products.  Subprime originations have climbe d to over 18 percent of total originations.  In terms of where these mortgages are being parked —whether they are on the books of banks and other financial institutions or are being securitized—a bout two-thirds of originations continue to be securitized. So the use of the markets is abou t the same.  But the ty pes of mortgages being securitized are changing. Again,  these are predominantly ARMs, and more of th em tend to be option ARMs—the higher-risk kinds of structures.   As we saw in the information presented about th e real estate mortgage pools that are being created, the risk profile in thos e pools is changing.  Interest -only mortgages were basically nonexistent in those pools two year s ago; they are now ru nning over 3.6 percen t of them.  Whereas a lot of these IO mort gages had very conservative loan-to- value ratios—under 80 percent—more and more of them now have  loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80 percent.  And about 9 percent of the IOs in these pools ar e going to subprime borrowers—that is, th e riskiest customers.  Yet those loans require interest-only payments, no amortizatio n.  Two weeks ago S&P required additional guarantees on a few of these mortgage pool s, which is another signal of concern.             150 of 234HELOCs are being used more fo r purchase money down payments .  People no longer have to save to make a down payment.  And when we look at HELOCs in general, for the last three years they’ve grown at a compound rate of over 30 percent a year.  As would any su pervisor, when I see a product growing 30 percent a year for three years, I tend to get a little  nervous about the concentration risk. Where is the li quidity coming from for these? Again, a big chun k of it is going to the securitization markets. I think one of the challenges  we have as bank supervisors is that, to the extent the banks are originatin g these loans with the intent to sell them to the market, they’re looking to the market for the credit definitions.   We know from our QIS-4 [Quantitative Impact  Study 4] results, looking at the Basel II exercise, that we had a huge disparity in the resu lts on loss expectations on home equity loans and other mortgage products.  A lot of  these are new types of products.  The confidence intervals around the expected defaults, I think, are a lot wider for th em than for those that have traditio nal structures.   We also know that there’s a lot of correlatio n risk that could happen here.  If the housing price bubble does break in a market where employmen t is dropping, people coul d be leaving an area and we could have more defaults.  In addition, we know that the dropping of home prices, in and of itself, tends to create more  defaults, especially with negligible equity in these properties.  Also, to the extent that people defau lt and the banks have more prope rties to foreclose, there are neighborhood effects, with losses getti ng bigger when the de faults do occur. So, what I am concerned about from a liquidity perspective,  since these are being securitized and moving into the market s—and there is plenty of  appetite in the market to take these products— is the lack of discipline  relative to previous periods.  In the ancient days, when mortgage loans stayed on the books of financial institutions, liquidi ty limitations forced them  to choose the higher quality credits.  This isn’t happening today.  And it isn’t clear if the marketplace currently       151 of 234understands the structure of these loans any better than some of us  do in terms of pricing the risk, as evidenced by the S&P move two weeks ago. So, again, I’m not overly concerne d.  Especially with the record  profits and capital in banks, I think there’s a huge cushion.  But the implications of this for housing wea lth and for investors who take the ultimate risk in these securities could cr eate some problems in terms of the way economic growth proceeds going forw ard.  And it’s something that I think was appropriate to spend the time talking about today.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON. Thank y ou, Mr. Chairman.  As Susan in dicated, I, too, looked at the mortgage market in anticipation of  the theme of our disc ussions yesterday.  But I also had a concern about the extent to which the mort gage market might be creating frot h in the market.  I interviewed several of the largest mortgage originators.  I talk ed to contacts at banks, nonbanks, and one of the large subprime lenders and asked them to approach th e question from the same perspective.  That is, I asked them: What are you finding that is new or different in your  market?  What attracts your eye because it’s new, and wher e do you see the risks em bedded in the na ture of the mortgage market today?  This does not address the question that Pr esident Guynn raised abou t the risks associated with the activities of contractors or  real estate develope rs, which is a separate  and very significant risk. It may get at the question that President Yellen as ked as to where the ul timate source of the stupidity is in the market—no t whether or not there is st upidity in the market.   In conclusion, mortgage terms are indeed becoming more flexible and less restrictive, creating certain defined risk exposures.  While eac h of the risk exposures appears to be both manageable and, to an extent, managed as isolated risks, they pose heightened risk in some areas             152 of 234due to the layering of the exposures.   It’s the layering that really causes the risk.  And, in part, it means that the most significant bo dy of the risk exposures is in identifiable markets and lenders. There is a lack of cons ensus as to how the relaxation of credit standards will impact safety and soundness. To date, loan delinquencies have  remained modest, both within and outside of the banking industry. However, th e undiminished appe tite, particularly fo r the nonconforming mortgage product, has allowed for the flexibility to continue.  An d there is no slowing in sight, despite all the warnings that we have heard and indications in some  markets that there has been a leveling, and even a decline,  in some property values. While that environment is clea rly likely to produce unrecognized risk somewhere in the financial system, it seems unlikely that that risk will  be in any of the portfolio lenders, including the bank lenders, to any significant extent, because of the avaricious nature  of the MBS [ mortgage­backed  securities] market.  The risks, as Su san and others have mentione d, are pretty obvious.  The IO loans, now for terms of up to  10 years, may account for 50 percent of total loans in some is known as the alt-A mortgage product, which makes loans based on stat ed incomes and stated assets, and carries a higher interest rate in excha nge for fewer verifications of the income and asset figures provided by the borrower. Let me give you an example of how the layering that causes the risk can work.  Let’s take as an example a loan in a high-end market such as California.  Th e mortgage sought by the borrower would exceed the maximum of Fanni e or Freddie, automatically making it a nonconforming loan and automatically removing the risk parameters th at are embedded in the conforming product.  Because it is nonconforming, it opens the opportunity for the Alt- A product, which means that it               153 of 234associated with that instrument does not seem to be captured in what the secondary market is looking for. So the secondary market will buy it.  The originator of the loan is ab le to meet the competition and rid its elf of that risk. That said, there are some identi fiable risks that are clearly being managed.  According to some lenders, about 20 to 25 mark ets bear careful watching, and le nders have started to exercise restraint in those markets.  Mo st of the markets were mentioned yesterday, but obviously they include places like Florida and Las Vegas. There is also an ability to look  at investor properties and su bdivide that categ ory into three groups.  One of them is the typical purchaser of a vacation home; Jack  Guynn is buying  in the Blue Ridge Mountains, for example.  Or, as Susan menti oned, another good example is the investor who is concerned about the equity market s and wants to move into residentia l real estate.  So  that isolates those in the third group—the most high-risk borrowers.  They are the ones who want to get by with the greatest amount of leverage.  That is the bor rower who is simply looki ng to take immediate short-term advantage of any increase in value.  And that is a buyer those careful mortgage lenders can address with more specificity. A great deal of uncertainty, frank ly, surrounds the interest rate risk exposure, because there have been very few adve rse interest rate periods in recent years and the industry experience is limited.  But the availab ility and proliferation of  FICO scores means that  interest-only and high loan-to-value mortgages are given only to those wi thin certain FICO bands,  where the lender has the greatest confidence in the borrower’s repayment ca pability, which is based on the historical experience of that borrower in terms of his or her debt  repayment record. To date, foreclosures have been limited and minimal at banks and bank mortgage subsidiaries in the prime markets for nonbank lenders.   That has a lot to do with the natu re of the            154 of 234secondary market.  One lender told me that they are usin g the secondary market first of all for their conforming products; second, fo r their nonconforming products; third, for their HELOCs; and fourth, for loans on fi rst delinquency.  And fo r the latter, this lender is se lling them at only a 2 or 3 percent reduction to book. So that loan is going o ff the books, and in some instances, they are even selling the residual in the secondar y market.  So there ar e five different channe ls through which this lender is able to use the secondary market.  It sounded to me very simila r to what the 1960s New York Yankees were doing with the old Kansas Ci ty A’s under Charlie O. Finley—using them to improve asset quality.  [Laughter]   They were unloading high-risk properties, and do ing so without any expectation of compensation fr om the counterpar ty.  And they were doing  it annually.  So it’s much the same thing that is happening now. As for the secondary mark et, why is that market so avaricious?  I’d cite a number of reasons.  There are many new investors, incl uding the hedge funds, with minimal experience in dealing with are either alt-A or nonprime.  That’s the flow, as we discussed yesterday.  There is evidence of a lack of secondary market discretio n, including the ability to price for risk; the risk premium simply does not reflect the risk embedded in that produc t.  There have been so me indications that the secondary market is star ting to tighten its standards, one of which Susan mentione d, which is the new guidelines from Standard and Poor’s.  The othe r is the beginning of so me change, particularly in the AAA tranche, where a slight price increase recently was passed on. In summary, the activity in the mortgage mark et shows no signs of abating.  The risk exposures remain, and the ri sk exposures seem most likely to be  in the MBS market .  The place to look for the first evidence of weakness would be in the first-loss position, wh erever that first-loss position happens to be. It ’s not clear at this point  if the MBS market will be  an efficient distributor            155 of 234and disseminator of risk or  if those in that market  will be the last to re cognize the ri sk that’s embedded in what they’re doin g and know how to price it. Mr. Chairman, I did not address the statement today because I see no need to adjust our “measured pace” language or to make any other significant adjustment to our statement at this meeting.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. 

[SECTION]

MR. GRAMLICH.  Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  I’ll let Tom respond on behalf of the Kansas City Royals.  [Laughter] This will be my 62nd and last statement at on e of these meetings, and if you’ll bear with me I’d like to give a few parting thoughts before I ride off into the sunset. I believe most of us think ab out monetary policy in terms of  what I will call a modified Taylor rule.  We don’t necessarily  follow the explicit Taylor rule outcomes of the Bluebook but we look at inflation and un employment and try to make them hit ou r target values, at  least over some horizon.  From time to time, we may shade our judgments based on some other factor that may seem relevant, which is fine.  But the basic focus remains on inflation and unemployment.  I strongly agree with this basic focus, and I get ve ry irritated when I see co lumns suggesting that we are trying to inspire or should be trying to prick a housing bubble, for example.  Th ere is no way to do that and still maximize the inflation/ unemployment outcome. Monetary policy is broa d and has broad effects.  When we take rates do wn in a soft economy, we probably will be creating some bubbles, or at least mi ni bubbles here and there—not because we want to, but because it is inevitable.  In th e late ’90s, holding out against raising rates and hence letting the economy achieve very low unemployment rates probably did add to the Internet bubble. In  the past few years, keepin g rates down for a considerable period probably did            156 of 234add to the housing bubble, if, in fact, there is a housin g bubble.  Given our primary focus on inflation and unemployment, I’m not sure there is anything we could have done about either bubble, and I am sure it would not have be en wise to go out of our way to try to prick either bubble. Today’s policy challenge is to reverse the hi ghly accommodative po licy we followed a few years ago in response to what I still think was a real threat of deflation. There has been lots of speculation about the so-called neutral level of the federal funds rate, as if once we hit neutrality we can stop raising rates.   First off, this speculation  is naive in the se nse that whatever neutrality is, it is more likely a zone than a precise rate.  Moreover, neutrality would only be desirable if the rest of the economy were in balanc e, which is probably never strictly tr ue, and certainly isn’t true now.  For these reasons, I’ve always been disdainful of the search fo r neutrality.   Whatever neutrality is, I think in the current circumstance we ought to take rates somewhere north of it.  The reason is simple: lags.  We have taken the funds rate  very low in response to threats of deflation.  That means that at the magic moment wh en we hit neutrality th ere will be still some accommodative policy in the pipeline —policy that would have  to be offset with at least a slight overshooting on the other side.  This is a well-kn own shower problem that has enlivened countless macro classrooms.  One can also see this overshooting in the optimal policy simulations in the Bluebook. One issue that has always been important to me involves national saving.  I continue to be a national saving freak.  Our rate is too low; no two ways about it.  Continued low national saving implies either a drop in investment, which is u ndesirable, or continued international borrowing, which is unreliable.  Like others, I would greatly  prefer to correct the problem through fiscal austerity. But despite some  welcome bulges in federal revenue, we all know that this is not real fiscal austerity and that we are quite unlikely to get real fiscal austerity any time soon.            157 of 234Given that fiscal policy is not measuring up , can we do something about national saving with monetary policy?  Unfortunat ely, I think the answer is no, at least as long as we are operating under a modified Taylor rule.  Ba sically, our approach can determin e the level of total output but not its composition between consum ption and investment.  Regarding this composition, there is an interesting new developmen t resulting from the financ ial innovation we talked  about yesterday.  I admit to having always been skeptical of the empiri cal importance of interest rates on consumption.  I would have thought that the fo rm of housing wealth, whether cas h or not, should not matter to rational consumers and that  these consumers should realize that interest rates have ambiguous effects on their lifetime optimization decision.  However, if consumption in fact does depend strongly on interest rates, as our econometricians say, at least some of the crowding-out impact of higher interest rates will be felt by consumption.  So I will swallo w my empirical misgivings and at least hope that our presen t easy fiscal and slightly harder moneta ry regime will be at least slightly less restrictive on investment and sli ghtly more restrictive on consumption. Another issue is, of course, the housing bubble.  My own view is that there probably is now a slight macro housing bubble, with the problem obviously being worse in selected real estate inflation and unemployment and start fighting bubble s.  But might it be poss ible to shape policy in the direction of fighting bubbles?  The question sounds very reas onable.  The problem comes when one tries to get specific.  A few months ago there was a conference at Princeton to address this very question.  What should monetary policy do about bubbles?  I was enlisted as a sp eaker in this session, and I then characte rized my views in Gilber t & Sullivan terms as, “We ll, never.  Oh, hardly ever.”  [Laughter]          158 of 234There are several arguments why we should hardly ever try to  prick bubbles.  Asset bubbles expansionary policy we ha ve consciously followed; and pricki ng bubbles may run at cross-purposes with the monetary policy properly based on infl ation and unemployment.  But I think the real problem with pricking bubbles ca n be seen from yesterday’s discussion.  How can we make that type of policy stabilizing?  If one reads the pres s or listens to Europeans—and I did that this weekend at Basel—the high level of house prices shou ld lead us to raise in terest rates higher than we otherwise would.  If one read s the Greenbook or the staff documents we talk ed about yesterday, the high level of house prices relative to rents le ads to the expectation that house prices are more likely to decline than to rise, so that stabilizing policy would be to  keep interest ra tes lower than we otherwise would. In that sense, the bu bble policy conundrum is similar to  the bond market conundrum.  Great analysis, guys, but do we move ra tes up or down?  In general, I think we ar en’t going to know.  House prices are high.  Do we re spond to the expectation by loweri ng rates to fight the anticipated collapse? To put it mildl y, this policy would be very hard to explain and carries the risk that our more accommodative policy would drive house pri ces even higher.  Imagin e what Steve Roach and John Makin would say about that!  If I can coin a term, this would be viewed as a Greenspan “shotput.”  [Laughter] On the other hand, do we do what the press would have us  do—raise rates and likely destabilize? This is a tough, perh aps impossible, question.  And our best approach is most likely to do nothing.  In that sense, mayb e my Princeton answer should have  been a straightforward “never.”                               159 of 234Whatever the case, I’m happy to ra ise the funds rate another notch today and to con tinue with the “measured pace” rhetoric. For th e future, my own five dollars sa ys that you will never figure out what neutrality is, but I am conf ident that you will be able to tell when to stop raising rates.   This leads me to my final poin t, which is to say how much I’ ve enjoyed working with all of you. These meetings have been in teresting, challenging, and productiv e.  I can’t say that monetary policy is the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my lif e, because I did spend three years trying to get diverse people to agree about Soci al Security, but it was hard.  And I think we did well.  The staff has been superb.  I can’t imagine better preparati on for meetings lik e this than fr om reading the Greenbook and the Bluebook.  All of you have been consistently  interesting and se nsible.  And the Chairman has run great meetings and has admirably melded our dive rse views into a coherent and effective monetary policy.  I will be eternally gr ateful for having been a part of it.  [Applause] Thank you.

MR. REINHART.8  I’m fairly confident, Mr. Chairman, that this will not end with applause. [Laughter]  I will be referring to  the materials that were handed out during your break. No one would be surprised if you admitted that you agreed with Yogi Berra’s characterization that it “feel s like déjà vu all over agai n.”  Once more, the market backdrop for your deliberations is, as show n by the black line in the upper left panel of your first exhibit, one in which expecta tions seem firmly fi xed on a quarter point firming today.  In addition, it’s hard to fi nd any market participant who believes that there will be any material deviation from th e scripts of the past few meetings in the announcement this afternoon. 8 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 4).           160 of 234There have, however, been some changes:  Market participants , apparently taking comfort in incoming economic data, revised down their expectation of the end point of this firming cycle, shifting from the expectation in early May of around 4 percent (the red dotted line) to the current readi ng where the black line flattens out at under 3¾ percent. With a quarter point hike today seen as a certainty, this implies that right show that investors assign about three-fourths probability weight to your being done before November and a ninety-five-ou t-of-one-hundred chance of your finishing up by the last scheduled meeting of the year. The issue before you today would seem to be how to describe the reasons for your action and whether to ratify current mark et expectations of a pause sometime soon— related to the economic outlook and policy strategy.  For one, what do you make of the further decline in the 10-y ear yield?  That yield, plotted with the black line in the middle panel, ended the intermeeting period a touch over 4 percent, further narrowing its spread over short- and intermediate-term rates. As can be seen in the lower left panel,  the nominal 10-year Treasury yield—line 1 —is now 79 basis points lower than its leve l just before your meeting one year ago, back when the funds rate was 1 percent. As noted in lines 2 and 3, indexed debt quotes indicate that this decline was two-thirds real  and one-third inflation compensation.  With short rates rising a nd long coupon yields falling, the arithmetic of the term structure requires that far-ah ead forward rates fall by more than the note yield. Indeed, the 1-year forward rate  maturing 10 years hence—line 4—shed 179 basis points over the past year .  Also of note, the declin e in Treasury yields showed through to private yields, with the AA corporate rate in line 5 of the table dropping a like amount.  Similarly, the yield conundrum is not a domestic phenomenon alone, as Mike Leahy showed. Euro swap yields, for example, have declined by more than dollar ones. The bottom right panel makes one last poin t: The decline in yields over the past year has come as a surprise.  By the expect ations approach to th e term structure, the upward-sloped yield curve of one year ago—the dotted line—predicted that its successors would shift up and flatten over time .  Instead of the long dashed curve that was predicted one year ago to prevail now, we observe the very flat solid line.  structure—probably because your actions we re so telegraphed—but after that, they went increasingly astray. The flattening of the yield curve is put in  a longer perspective in the upper panel of exhibit 2. The sharp declin e in the spread of the 10-year  over the 1-year yield may not seem so scary if you ascribe it to shifts in the demand and supply of longer-duration securities, the subject of the two left  panels.  As discussed in the memo I sent to the Committee last week, the allure of  longer-duration fixed-income securities        161 of 234might have increased of late if investor s perceive the macroeconomic environment— both nominal and real magnitudes—to be more  predictable.  An appreciation of the significant demographic shift in our near futu re may also have encouraged some shift toward longer-term assets by institutional f und managers.  At the same time, the U.S. Treasury has been making relatively fewer of those obligations—with the average duration of Treasury debt outst anding declining by about one-half year since issuance of the 30-year bond was discontinued. Lastl y, befitting the global dimensions of the burgeoning saving relative to shrinking inve stment internationally, including the efforts of foreign official entities to dir ect their own surpluses toward dollar assets. Changes in demand are difficult to measur e.  And it is incipient demand that needs to be measured, not quantities realized after asset prices adjust.  One way to quantify the relative shift in demand is to consider the predictions of multifactor models of the term structure.  Those mode ls try to explain the behavior of yields across maturities as parsimoniously as po ssible while making sure all assets are priced consistently. The models we keep in- house predict, as in the lower left panel, that a substantial portion of the reduction at the long end of the forward rate structure owes to a lessened term premium.  The cu rrent reading of 5/8 percentage point is indeed low in its historical range, but thos e estimates do tend to be volatile.  If that represents an exogenous shift in investor pr eferences, then it also represents increased financial accommodation that warrants a highe r policy rate than previously expected.  But not much is really exogenous when you talk  about financial markets.  If investors are buying more long-dated Trea suries, what are they buying less of?  That is, the financial impetus associated with a lowe r term premium might be trimmed by lower stock prices and a higher foreign exchange value of the dollar th an would otherwise be the case. The flattening of the yield curve woul d seem more worrisome if you thought investors were predicting th at short rates should be lower than previously expected— perhaps because, as in the middle right panel, they expect further restraint on spending from high oil prices, some rebound in  the domestic saving rate, or continued drag from the external sector .  Note that the flattening of  the yield curve need not be predicting slower growth, only that you will run policy on the easier side than previously expected to deliver good macr oeconomic outcomes.  As shown in the bottom right panel, predictions of GDP growth from a simple regression employing the term spread indeed have come down  appreciably.  But levels matter; and a forecast of 3 percent growth over the next year in an environment in which slack has been materially reduced ma y not seem so unwelcome. As estimates of resource slack narrow, Committee members might be particularly intent on ensuring that policy accommodati on is correspondingly removed.  If it is any consolation, the top left panel of exhi bit 3 shows that the current setting of the nominal funds rate, the black  line, is well within the policy prescription of the standard rules that we follow. Moreover, recent increases in the real funds rate, the          162 of 234black line in upper right panel, have pushe d that indicator clos er to the range of estimates of its equilibrium value.   As Secretary to the Committee, I spend some time worrying about the documentary record of your deliberations.  Thus, I can recognize a pattern in these meetings.  You repeatedly predict that your last policy move will be a mistake.  Stated so bluntly, it is a paradox worthy of Bertrand Russell, but practically it means that, as in the middle left panel, you may be close to the point where you should worry about what can go wrong. And that is  the second major question pertinent to your policy choice I put before you. Logically, there are two possibi lities, as in the middle left panel.  You might be worried that you will stop firming policy too soon or too late.  If market participants came to believe that you were behind the curve in policy tightening, inflation expectations could become unmoored a nd a good portion of your subsequent action would probably be directed to reasser ting your inflation-fighting credibility. That risk is why the Committee highli ghted its watchfulness about price developments in the rationale  part of the statement and added a sentence to its statement underscoring its vigilance against inflation.  Such a risk seems well contained, at least as judged by the measures of inflation compensation derived from the Treasury market plotted at the middl e right.  Inflation compensation—based on the CPI—has moved well south of 2½ percent over the foreseeable future. The other mistake you could make would be  to stop too late—that is, move the funds rate up beyond the level required to work down resource slack and keep inflation controlled. This could prove problematic if the Committee subsequently took some time to recognize its mistake or desired particularly compelling evidence to reverse itself. However, the Committee has been relatively nimble—say, in 1989 and 1995, as seen in the lower left panel—in unwinding some of its policy restraint.  Besides, with corporate risk premiums as low as shown in the bottom right panel, it seems unlikely that market participants view you as about to  overshoot in policy firming sometime soon. As laid out in the matrix at the top of  exhibit 4, in drafti ng the Bluebook, we tried to capture the implications for policy choi ce given the potential answers to these two key questions. That is, you could take th e yield curve as signaling (as along the column headings) economic weakness or a decline in term premiums and you might fear (as along the row headings) stopping ei ther too soon or too late.  Accordingly, alternative C offered both a firmer stance of  policy and words that would lead market participants to project even more firming to come.  Alternative A was structured to express more concern about th e outlook and to signal that the tightening cycle may be drawing to a close. The passage of time  may make some of the words of these alternatives relevant for future mee tings, but they’re probably not today.         163 of 234You may see little reason to diverge at this point from what seems to have worked fairly well thus far—measured policy firming—and therefore be attracted to alternative B. Although aggregate spending and output growth evidently slowed in early spring, the economy appears to remain reasonably robust.  Moreover, the recent evidence may be read as indicating that the pace of expansion is likely to rebound during the second half of the year to a rate  somewhat above that of potential output, even with further modest policy tightening.  And if inflation expectations were seen as well contained in May, they w ould seem even more so now.  Not to nag, but the structure of the existing statement will become increasingly strained over time at the four stress points listed in the bottom panel.  You currently describe policy as accommodative, productivity growth as robust, the risks as balanced, and the pace of tightening as likely to be measured.  An issue of strategy going forward is whether the statement shoul d be patched up as the situation warrants or left intact until the time comes when you believe additional policy tightening is no longer likely. If the latter, you’ll have to come to grips with just how much guidance you want in the statement in the future. For completeness, I’ve enclosed the latest version of Table 1, which was distributed this Tuesday and varies only slightly from what was in the Bluebook.  That completes my prepared remarks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Thank you.  Questions for Vincent?  If not, let me proceed.  This is a quite interest ing meeting in the sense that we’re obviously appr oaching the transition.  We’re not quite there but we’re debating all the various  elements of it, and I suspect that’s the right  thing to be doing at this  stage.  Indeed, I suspect it’s the only sensible thing we can be doing. For the moment, the underlying economy, from  my point of view , does seem to be moving forward.  The industrial production index for June, judging from th e weekly data, looks reasonably  robust. The first figures on initial claims—the  ones that came out this  morning—indicate an economy with ongoing strength. The weekly industrial production data plus the initial claims may be the most current global data that we have for th e U.S. economy, and bo th suggest that no immediate deterioration is occurring. We had a long discussion about housing yesterda y.  It’s very evident from the backlogs of the major builders that ne w home sales will continue apace, as the backlogs  presumably at some                164 of 234point wind down.  The buildup ha s taken a very long time; and even though there’s some evidence of topping, there’s really no meaningful evidence in the markets that housin g demand is falling.  Indeed, if anything, it’ s still on an upward tr ack, and the feeling is not that  it will fall ap art but that it will get much stronger and create some really serious problems in the adjustment periods. So, all in all, I myself am not  uncomfortable with the 3 percen t plus rate of growth in GDP going forward.  But I do wo rry about the fact that oil and gas co sts are beginning to eat into profit data indicate that margin s continue to move up , when you disaggregate  the segmen ts of the corporate sector into energy and non-energy, it’s fairly apparent that the margins for non-energy firms have already peaked out an d presumably at this stage may be moving down.  And remember, this is not only oil, but gas as well.  A significant  amount of the product inflation that we have seen is being partially offset by impr oved productivity in the use of ener gy, but not enough  to prevent a significant rise in unit costs.  As a consequen ce, pressures seem to be  mounting in that area. I am particularly concerned about it because even though we are p ublishing fairly large increases in output per hour—in fact 3 percent plus  in the first quarter—whe n we disaggregate the quarters into monthly data, it’s apparent that the re ason the productivity gains in the first quarter are as high as they are is that we moved into the quarter fr om a very high level.   December was high and, as best we can judge , there doesn’t appear to have been mu ch in the way of ga ins in output per hour from December through  April.  These data are subject to significant revision, but it’s fairly apparent that the momentum, at l east for a while, has been lost.  Nevertheless, the Greenbook does not project any particular strength in unit labor co sts, largely because it forecasts a 2.3 percent increase in compensation per hour.  This, as I be lieve David was mentioning,  is a flattening to a trend value. That’s more hop e, I think, than forecast.        165 of 234What concerns me is th at we are looking here at a potential pickup in the pace of unit labor costs overall and especially for non-energy corporations.  Moreove r, a number of you have cited anecdotal evidence indicating that pricing power , after exhibiting some signs of potency, is beginning to be restricted.  This, of course, is th e usual sign that profit margins are under pressure.  Indeed, if we start with  unit labor costs and the evidence of  diminishing pricing power, we’re obviously beginning to look at the process of pressu res on prices. That has two potential implicatio ns.  One, the history tells us that when marg ins turn down, the economy invariably runs into  some difficulties one or two quarters—sometimes a little more— later. We’re not quite there yet.  We’re close to the peak s in total, and in this  respect I’m not sure one should look strictly at non-en ergy corporations because energy is  an industry in this economy.  And the domestic earnings of the o il and gas companies are quite s ubstantial—much more so than they used to be because a goodly part of domestic oil earnings  is now in refining and marketing, areas where for a long period of time the numbers were negligible. So, it’s in the system. It’s expanding, but we seem to  be peaking out here.  Having said th at, it’s not clear to me that we’re seeing any underlying weakness yet, but I think we have to be careful because we’ve had a substantial ongoing expans ion and that has occurred in the context of fairly good productivity numbers. If it turns out that the recent data on productivity  are accurate—and as you know, the Greenbook projects a 0.6 pe rcent annual rate increase in produc tivity for the seco nd quarter and a return to our normal trends in productivity—the n this weakness will gradua lly dissolve.  And the reason it will dissolve is that unit labor costs will st art to flatten and margins will open, as they do in the Greenbook. The problem with inflation, however, is that if margin s start to come down and you are confronted with rising un it labor costs and you don’t have the buffer to absorb the rise, it does begin         166 of 234to give you a cost-push type of in flation, the likes of which we have not seen for a very long time.  The numbers have been cause for a little despair, at leas t in recent months, a nd that does suggest that we have to be careful on this.  Having said that, I thin k the risks are clearly balanced wi th respect to the outlook for both output and inflation.  Bu t I conclude from all of this—and a number of you have indicated that you’ve reached the same conclusi on—that when you’re dealing with a situation like this, policy tends to get created not by your ec onomic outlook, but by your loss function.  And here I believe it is reasonably clear, at l east to me, that if we e rr in stopping too soon and are proved wrong, the costs are very high. If we pe rsist and it turns out that  the economy is moderatin g and the disinflationary pressures, especially the worldwid e ones, are as strong as indicatio ns suggest they may be, then we can recover relatively quickl y.  And I don’t perceive the cost of making that type of mistake as one we need to be great ly concerned about. I conclude, therefore, despite the fact that the risks to the outlook are truly balanced, that our actions should take into account that very clear bias in interpreting the loss function.  Accordingly, I would propose that we make another 25 basis poin t move on the fu nds rate today and change the language as little as pos sible, recognizing that there is going to come a time—it may be at the amount of information as to when we ought to start to flatten out the funds rate path.  My guess is that at the point we have a meetin g and decide that we’re going to change the language and skip an increase, the markets will have be en three weeks ahead of us.  When we do it,  I think we’re more likely to do it in the c ontext of very little market reaction because that will be the general consensus of the market as well as our own.  So, I don’t think we have to fret excessively about how we’re going to get there; th e markets will help us.         167 of 234I must say to you that this is not the way the markets we re functioning in terms of being informative when I arrive d on the scene.  We no w have a federal funds futures market.  We have every sort of financial indicator.  Everybody is i nvolved in forecas ting what we’re going to do and, indeed, they do it for the reasons that we would.  So, it’s actually  easier to implement monetary policy now than it was when I first arrived here.  And I guess for my la st meeting I will pull a “Gramlich” and go over th is in some detail.  Ned has been here  a long time, and he has been a major leveling influence on  the rest of us.  Like Ned, I have been here a long time—maybe too long already. But it’s fascinating to  look at how the system has ch anged and where the signals are changing. In any event, I put the recommendation of 25 ba sis points on the table and the language that appears in alternative B, which will be distributed by Michelle.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairman, I support your proposal to raise the fed funds rate another 25 basis points, and I support the lang uage in alternative B,  which I believe is accurately represented on this  piece of paper.  In my view, this statemen t is as close to neutral as we could get relative to current expectations, and I think that’s the appropriate signa l for us to deliver at this time. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I, too, agree with your re commendation, Mr. Chai rman, and with the language of the draft.  I particularly concur with  your assessment of the loss function in terms of how we should think abou t policy.  While I’d like to make ongoing changes in this statement, now is not the time to do it.  So, I’m on board. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher.        168 of 234MR. FISHER.  I support the 25 basis point increase in the fu nds rate.  My only concern about the statement is the word “ele vated” in reference to pressures of  inflation.  But, like President Minehan, I don’t think this  is the time  to argue. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  I agree with your recommendation, and I agree with the alternative B statement that you proposed .  I have two comments:  One is that you said them with more guidance now.  So I think we need to be very careful not to provid e them with too much guidance. I h ope that’s clarified at least in the minutes if not in the statement.  And my second comment is that the way you described what might be co ming, with weaker growth and higher inflation, I think we’ll all be j ealous of Ned after a while.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Gramlich. MR. GRAMLICH.  I support ever ything, Mr. Chairman.  I would have never guessed that this tautological balance of risk statement would outlast me.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  Mr. Chairman, I su pport your recommen dation.  Like President Fisher, I’m concerned about the language describi ng inflation.  I thin k it will be somewhat of  a surprise to the       169 of 234market, which is taking some comfort from recent inflation data, and it may well perturb expectations upward.  But I support the recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation on both the language and the increase in rates.  I would ju st add two points.  One, in the go-round there was a clear concern that core inflation forecasts have  gone up, and a number of people said that the forecasts were now in a range that was at the upper end of their comfort zone.  I’d be  delighted if th e forecasts come down, but I think that’s a low prob ability.  Second, to Ne d’s point about the tautology, I can assure him of one thing: At some point the balance of  risk statement will come out.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

I’ll be reading the directive from page 30 of the Bluebook an d the balance of risk assessment  from the draft statement:  “The Federa l Open Market Comm ittee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stab ility and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, th e Committee in the imme diate future seeks conditions in reserve for the statement:  “The Committe e perceives that, with appropria te monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to  the attainment of both sustainable growth and price st ability should be kept roughly equal.  W ith underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respon d to changes in economic prospects as  needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.”
