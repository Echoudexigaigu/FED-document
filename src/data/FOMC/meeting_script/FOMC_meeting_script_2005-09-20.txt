CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, everyone.  We’ll start with Mr. Kos.  MR. KOS.1  Good morning, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you. I’ll be referring to the charts that are in front of you.   During this intermeeting period, market pa rticipants were principally occupied with the economic impact of Hurricane Katr ina and alternating th eir judgment as to whether the growth or inflati on effects would dominate.   The top panel of page 1 graphs the 3-m onth deposit rate in black and the same  rate 3 months and 9 months forward in red.  In the two weeks af ter your last meeting, the 9-month forward rate edged down a bit, as  market participants  began to speculate that the tightening cycle was pushing the fed funds rate into territory that was within hailing distance of the so-called neutral rate .  Forward rates then fell sharply in the days after August 29.  Suggested reasons for the fall include the possibility that the Committee might pause at this meeting or that the negative growth impact of the hurricane would dampen output and abbrevia te the cumulative amount of tightening, even if the Committee were to move today.  However, forward rates began to rise as by Friday’s inflation expect ations component of the Mi chigan consumer survey. Longer-term yields (in the mi ddle panel) told a similar story, with the 10-year Treasury yield heading toward 4.0 percent in the aftermath of the hurricane but rising to 4¼ percent subsequently. The yield cu rve, which had flattened on expectations that the impact on growth would dominate, steepened as concerns about growth were balanced by equal concerns a bout inflationary effects.  Adding to the uncertainty for the Treasury market was the wide range of  estimates for rebuilding the Gulf region and hence for additional federa l borrowing in fiscal 2006.   The bottom panel graphs the breakeven infl ation curve as of three dates: the day of the last FOMC meeting, the Friday before  Katrina hit, and this past Friday.  The horizontal axis represents the maturity of each outstanding inflation-indexed Treasury security. Note that the short end of the cu rve began to rise before Katrina inasmuch as oil and gasoline prices had already begun their ascent.  The breakeven curve rose 1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).           4 of 117further in the next three weeks across the curve, though the rise was especially pronounced at the short end. With nominal rates, on balance, little changed in the period and the breakeven curve higher, the effect has been to lower and steepen the real yield curve, as shown on the top panel of page 2. Given the arit hmetic relationships between nominal and breakeven yields, this graph merely takes th e information of the last two charts and shows it another way. Nevertheless, the redu ction of real yields is pronounced and protection from rising inflation.  In other as set markets, spreads and volatilities were mixed on balance and did not exhibit any uniform anxiety about a changed outlook.  The middle panel graphs the performance from  July 1 of selected equity indexes.  In general, equities have risen globally in that period, apparently unfazed by higher energy prices. The middle right panel gra phs the performance of the S&P 500 and its major components since the hurricane.  Not surprisingly energy stocks have performed best.  Meanwhile, consumer-related  equities have performed worst.  And some retailers, especially those catering to lower-income households, have been particularly hard hit, as hi gher gasoline prices took their toll on those consumers even before Katrina. Municipal bonds issued by governments in the Gulf region held in fairly well despite the physical destruction.  As an  illustration, the bottom panel graphs the spread to the 10-year Treasury of the New Orleans bond of 2029.  The spread narrowed versus Treasuries and outperform ed the broader index.  Apparently, the prospect of a multibillion-dollar infusion of federal funds quickly eased any anxieties investors might have had. Turning to page 3, there was no uniform  response in the spread and options option on the front-month gasoline contract for the year to date.  With the refinery outages, it’s no surprise that volatilities for gasoline have jumped sharply, though the extent of the spike is noteworthy. However,  as noted earlier, the picture for other assets is mixed.  The top right panel graphs  the implied 1-month volatility of 1- and 10-year swaptions. Volatilities on longer-d ated swaptions barely budged, though for shorter-dated swaptions—which are more se nsitive to changing expectations about monetary policy—volatility rose sharply. With equity markets rising modestly, the VIX [S&P 100 volatility index] traded toward the lower end of its range and actua lly declined after th e hurricane, as shown in the middle left panel.  Meanwhile, volat ilities on currencies, shown in the middle right panel, stayed low in the high single digits.             5 of 117Finally, credit spreads showed  no clear pattern.  The inve stment-grade spread at the bottom left and the high-yield spread in yellow at the bottom right both rose slightly. In contrast, th e EMBI+ [Emerging Markets B ond Index Plus] has continued to narrow to an all-time low spread despit e higher energy prices, a political scandal in Brazil, and uncertain elections in 2006 in  several large issuer  countries, including Mexico and Brazil. Turning to page 4, I wanted to return to a topic that President Minehan asked about at the last meeting, namely, the dynami cs related to settlement of the Treasury futures contract. To provide some background and context, th e top panel depicts in the light blue bars the peak open interest in the 10-year Treasury futures contract.  The dark blue bars represent the issue size of the cheapest-to-deliver Treasury security, also called the CTD. Starting in 2002, the volumes a nd open interest in th e futures contracts began to rise sharply. But w ith issue size remaining in the $20 billion range, the ratio of open interest to size of the CTD increased sharply. The growth of peak open interest did not raise eyebrows initially since most futures contracts are used for speculative, hedging, or arbitr age purposes.  Most contracts are closed out or rolled over into the next contract before maturity, and the volume of securities actually delivered was de minimis. For example, the middle left panel gra phs for the March 2002 contract the open interest in blue. With 15 days of trad ing left, open interest was about $40 billion equivalent on the 10-year futures contract. Over the next few days there was a slow no trouble borrowing the August 2010 security, wh ich was the CTD into this contract.  This was the normal state of affairs. However, as the markets have grown, some large market participants have begun to view taking delivery of securities as a vi able option compared to the alternative of slowly building a position in the cash market.  Other traders—perhaps more opportunistically—have noted th e disparity between the peak open interest and the relatively small issue size and may have concluded that there was an increased possibility that the shorts might have to deliver securities othe r than the CTD.  The center middle panel graphs the situation in June.  Open interest decayed very slowly as those with long positions in the futures market did not find it profitable to roll their positions. Instead they  took delivery.  As the shor ts realized they would be forced to deliver, there was a scramble to  find the February 2012 security.  In the event, the shorts were able to find en ough of the CTD—about $14 billion—to fully           6 of 117satisfy delivery obligations, but  the experience fostered conspiracy theories and the press articles that follow ed about a possible squeeze. The September contract, which has two days of trading left, is proving equally challenging. As shown in the middle right pa nel, the open interest with 15 days of trading left was an elevated $70 billion or so; and the decay has been slow, suggesting that the longs would trigger a multi-issue delivery.  In the past few days, the open interest has decreased, but the possibility for a multi-issue delivery remains. The CTD in this settlement cycle is th e August of 2012 security.  As one would expect, this issue is hard to find and trad ing very special in the repo market.  The bottom left panel shows in blue the overnig ht repo rate for that security, which has sizable delivery into the c ontract.  As the security was “boxed,” it has all but stopped trading in the repo market, and fails in the issue jumped to  more than $90 billion and yesterday they were more than $110 billion. From previous experience, those fails should clear up very quickly af ter the contra ct settles. So, has this flurry of activity affected the cash market or the shape of the yield curve?  All indications are that the answer  is no.  The bottom right panel graphs notes in the 5- to 10-year sector as of late last week.  The red dot  is the August of 2012 security. It is trading slightly rich to the curve but not disproportionately so, and it doesn’t seem to be affecting neighboring securities. The Chicago Board of Trade has instituted position limits for individual participants during the last 10 days of tr ading, beginning with the December contract.  Whether that will alleviate the problem or will shift the pressure elsewhere remains to be seen. Mr. Chairman, once again there were no fore ign operations in the period.  In that regard, I want to note that this coming Thursday will mark five years since our last intervention.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. There is obviously  some perceived advantage in taking delivery of the securities rather than just going into the market a nd purchasing them.  The sort of non-conspiratorial view is that a lot of people think something is  going on and, therefore, they might as well sit and accept delivery even though  that was not their intention when they bought the futures. What do you know is going on?  We cer tainly know who the pa rticipants are—or at least the Exchange knows. What have you learned?          7 of 117MR. KOS. Well, I’ll let Bob Elsasser fill in some texture here.  Certainly, larger investors are more active in the futures market and are using those contracts in more ways than they had, say, 10 or 15 years ago. So the prospect of a— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is this Fanni e and Freddie disproportionately by any chance?  Obviously, they do use the securities. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Yes, but I’m not specifically refe rring to them.  So, as these larger entities have become more active in the futures, for them the prospect of buying a multibillion dollar position through the futures market is  not daunting.  It’s something th at they’re easily capable of doing, whereas probably 15 or 20 years ago taking on a very large position and financing it might have been a task.  So I th ink that’s part of the story. Second, going into the cash market and build ing a multibillion dollar position might take a very long time. You might move the price agai nst you, whereas in the futures market there’s a lot of liquidity and in some wa ys it could be done more easily.  Now, that’s something about the trading dynamics.  But as you point out, if peopl e think something is happening—if one trader thinks that somebody else is goi ng to be taking delivery—then they might get on the bandwagon.  They might add to their own positions in the hope of getting some of those cheaper securities.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Instead of a scheduled close-out. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Yes. Now, there were some ot her dynamics this summer that I don’t want to get into having to do with position limits that th e Board of Trade instituted, which affected the situation at one point. But on the whole, yes, if you had intended to close out a position, you might be more inclined to take delivery if you observe the larg e open interest.           8 of 117MR. REINHART. Another point I would ma ke, Mr. Chairman, is that the contract allows you to make delivery of any securities  maturing between 6½ and 10 years.  The Chicago Board of Trade has a set of adjustment factors that are appropriate when the yields are at 6 percent.  And if the yield curve were flat at 6 percent, any of those securities maturing between 6½ and 10 years would be perfect substitutes.  So any small movement in the cash market would immediately mean that you could br ing in another security to make  delivery.  But yields in that sector are well different than 6 percent now, so the cheapest-to-deliver security is more distinct.  And you can get more movement in the cash market without it spilling over to the next security or the security after that.  So in that sense, the natural arbitrage that the basket of deliverable securities is supposed to provide is not working as well, because the adjustment factors by which the settlement price is multiplied are out of kilter with the prevailing level of yields. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. I’m rather  fascinated by the open interest being higher, as you get close to the end of the contract , than the total stock of the issue.  That’s the counterpart of what used to be the old co rn squeeze.  The same guys are doing it— 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. Right. And they used to trade May Maine potato futures when there were no potatoes in Maine in May. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. They did that all the time.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Is this what the Treasury is lo oking at?  Or is it something else that the Treasury has its task force studying? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Well, the Treasury did issue a large-position report request last week for this particular security.  So, those with large positio ns will have to report that by a particular date— it’s sometime this week.      9 of 117MS. MINEHAN. So they are looking at this situation? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I know that they’re concerned abou t the situation, and there was certainly a signaling effect perceived by the market when the Treasury issued that request for large-position reports. We saw some decay accel erating right after that request,  so perhaps some of the longs took that as a signal that th ey should reduce their positions.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further questions?   If not, would someone like to move the ratification of the tran sactions by the Desk? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  So moved. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Without objectio n, they are approved.  We now move on to the economic situation.  Ka ren Johnson and David Stockton. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Spot prices for crude oil were especially volatile over the intermee ting period, as uncertainty about the consequences of possible hurricane damage , along with other risks, drove up prices before Katrina hit the Gulf shore and as evolving expectations of the near- and medium-term implications of the storm damage induced fluctuations in the weeks following Katrina. In the last few days, concerns about Tropical Storm Rita have been added to the mix.  As has been our  practice, we again relied on the futures forecast period, and our projection of WTI [West Texas intermediate] prices through the end of 2007 is drawn from the futures curve as of September 12. The complexities of Katrina =s effect on energy prices are such, however, that specifying the WTI price still left unanswer ed a number of questions about related prices and quantities, both for the globa l outlook and for the U.S. economy.  With normal U.S. refining capacity  only accounting for roughly 80 percent of U.S. demand, and with four refineries  in the region still closed, we have projected a partial substitution of refined products for crude in U.S. oil imports in the near term.  In addition, with global refinery operations already about at cap acity, at least in terms of refineries capable of producing products that meet U.S. specifications, there is no scope for U.S. demand to draw upon global supply without having an impact on price. As a consequence, pr ices for refined products abroa d, particularly for gasoline, have risen. We have assumed that all of  the refineries will be operational by the beginning of 2006.         10 of 117U.S. crude oil production in the Gulf re mains at about 50 percent of the level before Hurricane Katrina, with some of th is reduction offset by release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  We expect that repairs to the damaged facilities will occur over time and have incorporated into  the forecast a gradual recovery that is completed early next year.  Consequently, we have bumped up our projection for crude oil imports in the first quarter to account fo r the transitory s hortfall.  The net effect of these developments is that we ha ve raised our projected price for spot WTI oil by $1.40 per barrel in the f ourth quarter of this year and by $1.80 per barrel next year. However, in the near term we have raised our projection for the U.S. oil import price by more, $2.60 per barrel in the fourth quarter and just below $2 per barrel in the following quarter, to reflect the change  in mix toward imports of refined product and the rise in product prices as well as crude  prices.  The net result is a forecast for the oil import bill that is not ably higher in the near term , but is less so by the end of next year. Other elements of the external forecast  that were affected by Hurricane Katrina include the shipments of non-oil goods into  and out of the United States through the region= s port facilities. The immediate percentage  impact on exports is judged to be a bit larger than that on non-oil imports, as  imports have greater flexibility to be diverted to other ports. The port facilitie s are reopening quickly, and these effects, particularly on a net basis, should be sma ll.  In addition, the current account balance will be positively changed by receipts by U.S. insurance firms of payments owing to reinsurance abroad and, to a lesser extent, by aid contributio ns from other countries to the U.S. economy.  These items will appear as transfer receipts in the nontrade portion of the current account. On balance,  this range of impacts from Katrina is expected to be transitory and of limited magnitude.   The outlook for foreign growth and inflation is, of course, also influenced by the change in our forecast for global energy pr ices and by the changes projected for the U.S. economy. In the near term, these two factors work in the same direction to lessen foreign growth. Over  a longer horizon, with U.S. growth projected to rebound next year, they are partly o ffsetting.  Upward pressure on inflation from energy prices is a growing concern of central banks and officials abroad.  The event of Hurricane Katrina reinforced the trend toward elevated oil prices that has been unfolding over the past few years. In some foreign countries, particularly emerging-market economies, officials have controlled domestic  energy prices to bl unt the effects of higher global prices. As elevated oil pri ces have continued, foreign officials have started to remove or lessen these subsid ies, with consequent  effects on inflation pressures.  David will continue our presentation. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. In adjusting our forecas t of the U.S. economy to incorporate the consequences of Hurricane Katrina, we  were forced to rely more on economic judgment and assumption than our models.  Perh aps that is just as well, given what I heard last month in Jackson Hole.  At va rious turns, the staff was criticized for                   11 of 117building models that bear no resemblance to economic reality and praised—or at least I think it was praised—for then having th e good sense to essen tially ignore those models through the wise use of add factors. That mixed message reminded me of a st ory told by Nobel laureate Ken Arrow.  During World War II, Arrow was assigned to a team of statisticians to produce long-range weather forecasts.  After a time, A rrow and his team determined that their forecasts were not much better than pulling pr edictions out of a hat.  They wrote their superiors, asking to be relieved of the dut y.  They received the following reply, and I quote “The Commanding General is well aware that the forecasts are no good.  However, he needs them for pl anning purposes.”  [Laughter]  I’ll have to admit that we face more than the usual ch allenges in the period ahead.  Over the next few months, I suspect that we will encounter cons iderable difficulty extracting the macroeconomic signal from economic data that could be profoundly affected by the consequences of this disaster .  But as we set ourselves to that task, it will be important not to lose sight of the fact that the larger influences of monetary and fiscal policy, financial conditions, and global energy developments, rather than the hurricane, are likely to dominate the macroeconomic outcome a year hence. In that regard, while it might seem like ancient history and a world away, most of the macro data that we received sinc e the August Greenbook provide a window on how these forces were shaping economic developments prior to Katrina.  In brief, we saw the balance of the incoming information as  broadly consistent with our view that the economy had been growing at a bris k pace early in the second half.  In particular, the household sector seem ed especially buoyant.  Sales of motor vehicles were receiving a considerable boost from the employee discount programs.  And last week’s retail sa les report for August sugg ested consumer spending excluding motor vehicles had been well maintained.  Meanwhile, housing activity remained strong, with both starts and sale s holding near histor ic highs.  I should mention that this morning’s release showed housing starts  in August remaining above 2 million units at an annual rate—close to our expectations.  Even the external sector appeared poised to make a contribution to current-quarter growth, rather than being the drag we had earlier anticipated. But there were some disappointments as  well, mostly focused in the business sector. Growth of factory output has slowed noticeably, with manufacturing IP [industrial production] having averaged incr eases of 0.2 percent in recent months— half the pace seen late last year. We have interpreted that de celeration as reflecting efforts by firms to bring inventories into be tter alignment with sales, and we expect some pickup in activity as this process plays out.  But as yet, we have few hard data to suggest a marked improvement is close at hand.                  12 of 117The incoming information on new orders and shipments for nondefense capital goods also has been on the soft side of our expectations.  Spending on computers looks to be on track for a 16 percent increa se in the current quarter, a relatively modest gain for this component and well be low our previous projection.  And outlays for capital goods outside of th e tech area have been about flat since the turn of the year. As you may recall, equipment invest ment was surprisingly strong in the second half of last year, and we may now be e xperiencing some payback for the earlier strength. It is also possible, however, that higher oil prices could be damping business confidence, raising uncertainty about the outlook and making firms more reluctant to invest. And, of course, we can ’t rule out the possibility that the recent weakness in equipment spending reflects a dearth of prof itable investment opportunities, which would raise questions about the underlying thrust of aggregate demand going forward.  For now, we think it is  too early to reach that conclusion, but the recent softness here cert ainly raises that risk. Putting these pluses and minuses together, we thought the economy was on track for growth in the vicinity of 4 percent in  the second half of this year.  We were encouraged in that interpretation by th e ongoing improvement in labor markets.  Gains in private payrolls had averaged about 175,000 in recent months, and with the readings on initial claims remaining in  the low 300,000s, a continuation of those increases seemed likely. Looking a little further down the road, th ere had been the usual crosscurrents in the key factors influencing the contours of our  forecast.  Oil prices continued to rise, siphoning off even more purchasing power from  households.  But, we were surprised yet again by the strength in housing prices, with the OFHEO [Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight] repeat-transactions index up about 13 percent in the year ending the second quarter. The asso ciated upward revision to housing wealth more than offset a slightly weaker stoc k market to boost overall household net worth over the projection period.  All in all, it se ems likely that, absent the hurricane, we would have been presenting to you a forecast that was very similar to that in the It is, of course, an understatement to say that Katrina creates complications for our forecast—some that we have confronted in the past and some that are unique to this episode.  There has been a sizable destruction of the capital stock; we have assumed that loss to be about $75 billion, but  at this point any estimate must be considered a guess subject to substantial revision.  There has been an unprecedented displacement of people and activity from th e Gulf Coast region.  Important links in the nation’s transportation network have b een disrupted.  And of perhaps greatest concern from a macroeconomic perspectiv e, the economy has been subjected to a further energy price shock at a time when  households and businesses already were having to cope with the effects of near ly two years of steadily climbing prices.                  13 of 117As we noted in the Greenbook, our assessm ent is that, with a few wrinkles, the influence of Katrina on economic activity will trace out a pattern similar to that we have seen after previous disasters.  Output  will be depressed in the near term by the disruptions to production in the region and elsewhere.  As those disruptions ease, activity begins to recover. And then on ce rebuilding efforts really get under way, output receives a considerable boost.  In re ality, aspects of all three of these phases operate simultaneously—but with diffe rent intensities as time passes. In that regard, one can’t fail to be impr essed with how rapidly some aspects of the recovery process already are occurring—in many cases, faster than was initially expected. Some evacuees are finding empl oyment elsewhere; many firms are either temporarily or permanently relocating o ffices and employees; and workarounds are being found for some of the transporta tion bottlenecks that  have developed. Still, there is no denying that  the disruptions remain subs tantial.  About 15 percent of total U.S. oil production and 7 percent of U.S. natural gas output remain shut in at facilities located in the Gulf.  As Karen noted, four refineries are still off line and full recovery may not occur for several more months.  Activity in the chemical, shipbuilding, and food processing industries —to name just a few—remains seriously impaired.  More broadly, business has b een disrupted throughout the region.  And while many businesses have been eff ective in developing workarounds, these adjustments are often less efficien t and more expensive than before. In our forecast, we have assumed that  these disruptions pu ll down the level of activity in the third and fourth quarters, l opping more than ½ per centage point off the annualized growth of real GDP in the second half of this year.  Accompanying this hit to growth, payroll employment is expect ed to drop 250,000 in September—a shortfall of about 400,000 relative to trend. Employment  is then expected to stage a gradual recovery in subsequent months.  Although rebuilding activities  are already under way, thos e activities don’t really show through with any macroeconomic force un til early next year.  In that regard, the draining and environmental cleanup of New Orleans will slow the rebuilding phase compared with past hurricane recoveries. The dynamics of the recovery process will be influenced importantly by the response of the federal government.  We have assumed an $85 billion fiscal package, about $70 billion of which is spent over the next two years.  This spending is projected to provide a powerful counterbalance to the depressing effects of Katrina and is a chief reason why activ ity is projected to approach  the pre-hurricane baseline by the middle of next year. Our assumed federal spending package might seem small compared with the $200 billion figure that has gained such attenti on in recent days.  However, we think our                    14 of 117package is appropriately scaled to our estima tes of the extent of the damage that has occurred and the dimensions of the economic  disruptions.  Even with that scaling, I should note that we have the federal governme nt footing the bill for a vastly larger share of the losses than is typical—nearly dollar for dollar in our  forecast relative to the 25 percent reimbursement rate that is more the norm. One obvious risk that you confront is  that the hurricane, viewed from a macroeconomic perspective, could prove less disruptive to activity and that a massive dose of fiscal stimulus is a bout to be layered on top of an economy that was already nearing its productive limits.  In those circ umstances, there is the potential for some overshooting in output with accompanying upward pressure on inflation. But Katrina has amplified some of the downside risks to the outlook as well.  Prior to the storm, we were already concerne d about the cumulative effects of the rise in energy prices over the past two years. As we noted in our briefing yesterday, there is at least some evidence that sharp jumps in the price of oil have at times in the past been associated with outsized effects on consumption.  With the retail price of gasoline having risen above $3.00 per gallon in much of the country, there is certainly cause to be concerned. As a macro guy, I hope that those of you involved in supervision haven’t been too hard on ho me equity lending, because pretty soon people are going to need a loan to fill up their SUVs.  [Laughter] Moreover, the price of gasoline is not the only drain on consum er budgets.  Households will face another hurdle this winter when the bills for heating oil and natural gas come due.  So this source of downside risk seems likely to be with us for some time. For now, there simply isn’t much hard evidence to suggest any nonlinear response is gaining traction. As I noted earlier, c onsumer spending has continued to surprise us to the upside. Although last Friday’s report on sentiment showed a substantial deterioration, that drop closely matched our expectations.  The forecast is predicated on a gradual recovery in sentiment by the end of  the year.  If that were not to occur, we would become more concerned about a greater retrenchment in consumer spending. Of course, the cumulative effects of  higher energy prices also pose some nonlinear risks to the inflation outlook.  Three channels, not entirely independent of each other, would seem to be  of greatest concern: a broad-based breakout to the upside in inflation expectations; an intensif ied push on the part of workers to restore real wages for the ground lost to higher en ergy prices; and an effort by businesses to more aggressively repair damage that ma y have occurred to profit margins from rising energy costs. If one were inclined to worry about the potential for a more pronounced deterioration in inflation expectations, la st Friday’s preliminary read from the Michigan survey for September might be unsettling.  Median year-ahead inflation               15 of 117expectations moved up to 4.6 percent,  the highest level since 1990, while expectations for the next 5 to 10 years edge d up to 3.1 percent, just above the narrow range in which they have held over the past several years.  However, we suspect that the enormous increase in gasoline prices that took place over the first half of the month was a contributor to this developmen t, and we would counsel waiting for a few more readings before concluding that there has been a consequential deterioration in inflation expectations. That view rece ives some support from TIPs [Treasury inflation-protected securities] -based measures of inflation compensation, which have also increased, but by much le ss than the survey reading. We also don’t see much evidence that we are on the verge of a substantial acceleration in labor compensation motivated by efforts of workers to restore real wages. Abstracting from the surge late last  year that we believ e was related, in part, to stock option exercises and bonuses, the growth of hourly labor compensation has been reasonably stable over the past fe w years.  And while the labor market has tightened up, we don’t hear much from our  business contacts to suggest that the competitive environment has changed in a way that would have altered their ability or inclination to grant substantially larg er pay increases in the period ahead. Finally, there is a concern that the st eep rise in energy costs has placed the result in more upward price pressure than is  currently anticipated in the forecast.  To be sure, there is considerable  heterogeneity across industrie s.  However, as best we can judge, in the aggregate, the marg ins of nonfinancial non-energy producing corporations have reached hi gh levels over the past couple of years despite pressures from energy costs.  Hence, businesses eith er have been reasonably successful in passing through higher energy costs or have implemented other offsetting efficiencies. Looking forward, we think that  we have made adequate allowance for further pass-through of higher energy pri ces, but we acknowledge that there are considerable uncertainties about the magnitude of that effect. Much like the data on real  activity, the incoming information on the price side provides little evidence of an emerging non linear response to higher energy prices.  Indeed, the recent figures on core inflation have been both well-behaved and to the low side of our expectations. On the basis of last week’s CPI, we estimate that core PCE prices were up 0.1 percent in August and are on track for an increase of around 1¼ to 1½ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter.  Moreover,  prices of core intermediate materials have actually been fa lling over the past four months after the steep run-up experienced last year.  We are anticipating some acceleration in core consumer prices and in core intermediate prices in the months immediately ahead, owing to the end of the auto incentiv e programs and the pass-through of higher energy prices. But we have built these eff ects into the forecast using our usual linear models as guides, rather than incorporating any outsized effect.               16 of 117While we do not believe that we have yet experienced nonlinear effects on either output or inflation, any further upward move ment in energy prices would certainly intensify the risks of such outcomes.  With  another storm moving toward the Gulf, we will be watching The Weather Channel closely in the next few days. Before closing, I would like to draw your attention to some su bstantial changes in both the content and format of the Gree nbook’s green sheets that we implemented this round. As far as we can determine, th is is the most significant change in the forecast presentation in a few decades.  We recognize that we may have imposed some transition costs on those of you who were  used to the previous format.  But our objective was to make the presentation more user-friendly and to make the forecast and how it has changed between rounds mo re transparent to you and your staffs.  Obviously, we are open to suggestions for further improvement and, if past is prologue, we should be able to work them into the Greenbook at some point in the next few decades. [Laughter] Karen and I will be happy to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Qu estions?  President Lacker.   

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Yes. I want to ask you a bout the effects of Hu rricane Katrina on output and potential output. You read off a list of effects.  Obviously, there has been some destruction of capital stock. Workers have be en displaced; there has been a break in relationships between them and their employers, and obviously there will be  some sort of search process to reconnect them with the labor market.  And then there are the transportation disruptions.  Those all seem to me like factors that affect pr oductive capacity, and I would have expected them to appear as changes in potential output. So I’m curious as  to why output changes by more than potential. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. The part that we actually incorporated into our estimate of potential output was the destruction of the capital stock—th e $75 billion drop there.  That is just such a tiny fraction compared to the overall size of the ca pital stock that, in fact , it rounded to a tenth on the capital intensity contribution but rounded to not even a tenth on overa ll potential GDP.  So we built that part in.        17 of 117Now, it is true that what we are going to be experiencing in the next few months will have combinations of demand and supply effects,  and we didn’t build the temporary disruptions in the supply chain into our esti mate of potential GDP.  We could have.  You’re right; in some sense that is a temporary reduction in supply.  So  we wouldn’t necessarily tell you to take the output gap estimates in the second half seriously in  terms of the notion that  a lot more slack has opened up in the economy. On the labor market side, we actually did think hard about whether or not this event would be significant enough to raise structural  unemployment.  Again, our best guess is that while a little of that may be going on, it isn’t large enough to round to even a tenth on overall structural unemployment.  If all those people we think have been displaced became structurally unemployed, that would be an increase of a couple of tenths in structural unemployment.  But, in fact, we expect that by early next  year that will not be a signifi cant factor pushing up the natural rate of unemployment.  So I think we’ve tried to contend with those issues.  As a matter of presentation, we did build some of the things you raised—for exampl e, the transportation bottlenecks—into our estimat e of potential output. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Well, the reason I ask has to do with high-frequency movements.  You used the word “structural” there, which tends to be associated with  slowly moving trends— variables with bars over them or  that kind of thing.  And in an  instance like this, I think a key factor is the extent to which some high-frequency or rapid change in productive capacities may have taken place.  So, I question sort of letting it all be in the output gap and then saying, “Well, in two quarters the output gap will be back to  where it was.”  Given the way the output gap appears in theoretical models that we use to teach people how to think about policy, this would          18 of 117invite them to think about policy in the current period differently than if the empirical estimate had potential changing fairly shar ply along with output in the curre nt period.  That’s the reason I ask. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Obviously, in terms of the transmission of that output gap in thinking about inflation, our Phillips curve in essence is so flat and that slightly higher output gap is so briefly encapsulated in the forecast that it doesn’t  really have any noticea ble effect.  But we did think about how we should communicate the conse quences of the supply disruptions in potential output. And again, we just decide d on reflection that we would in corporate the part that was the capital stock destruction but not necessarily other supply disruptions that are admittedly going to be occurring in the next few months. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  I wanted to ask you a questi on about inflation expectations, which is a key part of the forecast, as you described. In the Greenbook, you say that you assume “surging energy costs and other factors have caused inflation expectations  to drift up since 2003.”  And then you have the alterna tive scenario in which inflation exp ectations deteriorate more sharply than in the baseline forecast. Could you just elaborate on this a bit?  What  are the other factors? And what’s the time horizon you’re talking about fo r these expectations to  play out?  Also, how does this work its way into the wage  and price dynamics in the economy? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. In terms of how the price forecast has evolved over the last couple of years, the single biggest factor is the higher energy prices.  But we’ve also had to contend with an acceleration—of modest dimension, but an acceleration—in import prices and an increase in other materials prices.  So, in terms of decomposing the sources of revision to our core consumer            19 of 117price inflation numbers, those are the main contri butors.  Beyond that, we ha ven’t really seen any other innovations on the cost struct ure on the side of businesses that we think have lifted core prices. But in our view, the persistence of higher headline and core inflat ion over the last few years will cause—and we do think there has been a little bit of evidence—some small deterioration in inflation expecta tions, and we have built that into our forecast.  The way that shows up, as I think you were hinting, comes th rough some prospective acceleration in nominal hourly labor compensation.  We haven’t seen it yet to any significant degree. But in our forecast we think there will be some i ndirect effects working through hi gher labor costs going forward.   As for the time dimension over which that wi ll occur, we think that process is probably under way. There may be some evidence of it in  the TIPS-based measures that Dino cited, and the survey evidence suggests that the process may now be beginning.  We’re starting to see a small but gradual erosion in inflation expectations , and that persists through our forecast horizon. Now, looking farther out, with energy prices pr ojected to start declini ng and headline inflation coming down from the 3-plus percent area to  more like 2 percent going forward, we would expect that process to reverse a bit in the period beyond the current forecast horizon.  So those inflation pressures probably will diminish a little at that point. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  So you have core infla tion actually going up ne xt year, in 2006, and then it comes down a bit in 2007. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Core PCE goes up to 2¼ pe rcent next year and then comes back down to 2 percent, as the indir ect effects of lower energy prices  begin to work through.  And             20 of 117then we’d probably see some beneficial effects in alleviating inflation concerns—this would be beyond the forecast period—which would help  push inflation down a bit further. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I know we us e the various measures of inflation expectations as a critical variab le, which presupposes that the mark et has a superior capability of anticipating change than normal forecasting pr ocedures.  The mechanism, as you point out, through which we think inflation ex pectations largely reflect themse lves in higher prices is the wage bargaining process. Have we done much wo rk in the area of using various measures of inflation expectations directly as a forecast indicator of inflation by just creating a reduced form evaluation?  What is the record on that, if we in fact have looked at that? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Surprisingly, or at least surprisingly to me, the Michigan survey has had a reasonably decent record over many years—better than you might think.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do you mean on their long-term inflation forecast? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Well, on the year-ahead infl ation forecast.  The longer-term forecast actually has not been around long enough to develop a lot of observations on that.  The evidence is mixed when you more or less throw all of the de terminants of inflation into an equation.  In fact, it’s a matter of some controversy among the re searchers on the staff as to whether or not the Michigan survey has any additional explanator y value.  But I recognize that you were just referring to the straightforward inflation— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  No. I wasn’t refe rring to only the Michigan survey, but to all of the various measures we have of inflation expectations, including basically just the level of interest rates as such. What I’m trying to get at  is that we make presumptions about the insight            21 of 117of markets into the future that non e of us personally has.  I’m rais ing the question: Is there really information there?  In other words, can we take the level of inflati on expectations, however defined, as of today and read into it with some degree of accuracy what the actual inflation outlook is likely to be? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Our indexed securities ma rkets have not been around long enough to develop a really significant track  record.  I think the evidence on the indexed securities from other countries is that there is information content in those ex pectations, but I don’t know what their general track record has been. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Yes. They have been ar ound the longest in the United Kingdom and in the early years indexed s ecurities were very clearly held in response to the tax incentives.  So there was a certain disconnect; th ere wasn’t a notion that people who viewed those expectations as differing from their own would trade and th e market would settle into reflecting their expectations on the margin.   I’m not aware that people generally  view that as a solid predic tor, but I would say that we probably should look into that more.  We have n’t done our own independent work on that. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. There are two aspects of th e TIPS market that make it hard to do such comparisons using those securities.  The first is  that we think there were significant liquidity effects, as in the United Kingdom, early on.  Our estimates of the liquidity premium have come down a lot. That is, TIPS were a real bargain in  the first two or three ye ars of trading, and it is only now that they probably more closely reflect the macro environment. The second thing is that what we measur e is inflation compensation, and inflation compensation is inflation expectations plus an in flation risk premium. And the inflation risk      22 of 117premium could vary over time.  Indeed, our mode ls would think that part of the reduction in long-term rates has been a reduction in the inflatio n risk premium.  So that’s another reason why it would be hard to read those as  predictors of future inflation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Several years ago I recall that we ran a correlation with the gold price against levels of inflation.  We actually came out with some forecasting capability.  Has that been rerun in recent years? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Not by us. MR. STOCKTON: Not by me.  I think we did that at your request.  [Laughter] And we were not so convinced by the evidence that we ’ve maintained that pa rticular series for forecasting. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. I think you actually alternated your requests—asking each one of us in turn—and we haven’t upda ted that in a long time. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The problem is that  it kept coming out, for reasons I can’t understand, with some information capability.  The r eason I raise it, as you know, is that we have a big, fat spike here, and I don’t know what to make of it. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Yes, a 17-year high. I volunt eer to run the gold price.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Provided th at you don’t tell anybody you’re doing it! 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Right. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. MR. FERGUSON. Two points—a comment and a question.  I’m actually somewhat surprised at the answers you got on your last question, Mr. Chairman, because staff members from both R&S [Research and Statistics] and Mone tary Affairs did a series of memos for me on       23 of 117just this question, and I talked about the results at  the last meeting.  We found, in terms of root mean squared prediction error, that the staff for ecast seemed to be the best forecast of one-year­ahead  inflation. But in the last four or five y ears, trying to control as best our staff could for some of the liquidity effects a nd risk premium effects that Vin cent talked about, our finding was that TIPS compensation turned out to be a somewhat better predictor even than the staff model.  The other forecasts turned out to be much worse th an either of the two I just talked about.  So I think we don’t know a lot, but we know a little bit.  Ma ybe we could get that material circulated again. My question, though, is not on that point. Dave, you threw me off a bit on the question of where we now stand on compensation because in the Greenbook you said that the downward revision in the P&C [Productivity and Cost] meas ure of compensation per hour was smaller than expected and, “we now view more  of the surge in 2004 fourth-quarter compensation as having been permanent and less as a reflection of transitory factors such as st ock options.”  I thought what I heard you say in your oral presentation wa s that the pendulum had swung back a little.   

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Indeed, we did not get as much downward revision as we were expecting and, in essence, we built into this forecast more persistence to the level of compensation.  But the growth rate of compensation as we moved into this year still looks like a big spike, and the growth rate go ing forward hasn’t been that much  higher.  So, I would say that obviously we were not as optimistic as we were last time around.  We had to give that some weight, but we didn’t necessarily see those data alone as sign aling an ongoing acceleration in labor compensation.  The two other pieces of evidence we bring to bear on that are the ECI [Employment Cost Index], which has shown no accel eration, and average hourly earnings, which    24 of 117also have not shown any additional pickup. So that suggests to us that we’re probably on the right track with regard to the s ources of the surge late last y ear.  Speaking more broadly about overall labor cost pressures, we’re still not in terpreting the current s ituation as one of ongoing sharp acceleration but rath er just a reflection of a higher level last year. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Great. Thank you. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think the ECI is a very interesting issue.  Each March, as I recall, we get data on actual dollar amounts of compensa tion of the various types that are in the ECI. And I believe we used to take the March da ta year-on-year and try to determine what part of the ECI was a mix change. In view of the quite extraordinary divergence of the ECI and the compensation per hour data, have we looked at those March data recently to see whether the aggregate dollar compensation per hour number that they pick up for the month of March, which is conceptually consistent with the ECI, moves with aggregate compensation per hour that we pick up from the P&C measure or others? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I don’t recall whether the EC I data, when we looked at it this spring, actually resolved the tension be tween the various measures.  Da vid Wilcox indicates that it did not. Okay. So we have looked at that, but— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  It is concei vable, for example, that the March compensation data in this series actually show th e same pattern as the total, which would imply a very significant internal shift change.  And th at would be a fully comprehensible explanation because in the past they have not been all that close    25 of 117MR. STOCKTON. Well, when we looked at it,  that didn’t in fact resolve the tension between them. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. So we didn’t learn anything from there.  President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, I have two questio ns.  One is to Karen with regard to the energy futures markets.  Have we seen any change in the dynamics of those markets during the trading activity—higher numbers of contracts or  size changes—from what we saw pre-Katrina? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I have not looked at that enough in the last few days to give you an answer to your question. There have been, obviously, over the past year or more, periods of time in which the nature of trading in the energy fu tures market seemed to be evolving.  Indeed, energy futures came to be thought of as an asse t class for which hedge funds and investment banks would open up departments and would trade a ggressively.  It was a profit center, so why not?  I don’t know that that has ended. But some of the other instan ces about which people were most concerned died down and I think the number of contract s that were thought to be noncom mercial would ebb and flow as time went by.  The fact that the price came back  down helped because there was a time when it looked somewhat like the Japanese stock market in the late 1980s:  It was just about a sure bet that if you could buy some of the stuff, you woul d make money.  And that went away as the price developed some two-way fluctuations and so forth. But to be honest, I don’t have the informa tion to give you about wh ether post-Katrina we have seen a real change. It was certainly st artling how quickly the price moved yesterday when it became clear that Rita was going to cross into  the Gulf.  That volat ility may re flect more traders of different backgrounds ac ting more quickly.  I wouldn’t interpret that as indicating that     26 of 117somehow those movements are superfi cial.  I think there is a genuine increase in the extent to which people believe the global supply of energy is vulnerable to random events and has very little buffer capacity in it. Those things, I think, are real. Whether on a given piece of news  the trading is mostly done by hedge funds or is mostly done by people who have a genuine need to hedg e in the commercial sense, I don’t think we know. But there is a change in tone. People feel that the supply capabili ty both at the refinery level and at the extraction level is not there to meet the projected demand and that we’re going to be on a bit of a knife’s edge. And they believe that developments on the political side in Russia or in Venezuela could easily tip the balance.  I think that is for real. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. The reason I’m curious about this is because I think we have been struggling with trying to determine what the spec ulative element is in t hose markets.  Clearly, those who did speculate for whatever reason on an  event, such as the one you just mentioned, have been rewarded. But sometimes the comple xion of those people who then enter the market changes; the smart ones get out when they’ve been rewarded and they’re replaced by what we used to call the mullets who swim in smaller contract s.  I’d just be curious to see what the change in the dynamics is, if indeed a change is taki ng place at all.  The other question—excuse me? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. We do know some thing.  We know that subsequent to Katrina the noncommercial interest s are net long and the commercia l interests have turned net short. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That in a sense gives you some speculative suppression because they’re already out. And the question is  the big surges which, as you know quite well,     27 of 117occur when somebody is short and they cover it and they go long.  Curre ntly they’re already long. So it may be that part of the pressure is out of this market, although the market behavior yesterday had a tone of “we’ve been burned once, we’re not going to be burned twice.”  It’s correcting in part today, but I’ve never seen a response that quic kly on something that could be quite speculative. There’s a reasonably good chan ce that Rita won’t turn into a category 3 hurricane, or if it does that it will end up in northern Mexico.  It’s really quite surprising the way that market functions. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Again, as we talked about a couple of weeks ago, the point is the volatility—not so much the direction—and yesterda y reinforced that concern.  I’m just trying to get a sense of these dynamics. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Today the gasolin e price I last saw on the spot market, after being up over 20 cents yesterday, was down 10 cents.  Today it’s fairly stable. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. My other question is about the $85 billion fiscal stimulus assumption.  Is that based on rational expectations of, say, the women and men who sit around this table?  Or is it based on some soundings of the politicians on Capitol Hill?  What is the source of the $85 billion figure? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I think it was a little bit of both.  As I indicated, the scale of that package we thought would be sufficient in some sense, given our estimates of the amount of damage that has occurred, to provide both the wherewithal to fund subs tantial amounts of the rebuilding and to provide significant offsets for income losses that were associated with the disruptions.      28 of 117The $200 million figure which, as I mentione d in my briefing, has gotten so much attention recently actually came into play afte r we closed the Greenbook.  But even if that had come up before, I don’t think we necessarily wo uld have altered our projection significantly.  Our reading of that is that if  the figure comes in that high, it’s more likely to be because it includes the funding of some ve ry long range and expensive c onstruction projects around New Orleans—for example, the significant strengtheni ng of the levees to a category 5 level of protection. That spending would occur outside the window of the current forecast projection. But obviously there are risks, and if I had to be honest, I’d say the risks are probably more to the upside of the figure that we have built  into this forecast than the downside, given the current political climate in which the general attitude seems to be “we’ll spend whatever it takes to make this happen.”  We illustrated a little b it of that in an alternative simulation that we showed in the Greenbook in whic h the disruption effects are relatively small and you get a much bigger fiscal stimulus.  The results associated wi th that are a drop in the unemployment rate to below what we would think of as the natural rate and a bit higher inflation pressures. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Karen, do we know anything about the remaining capacity—or perhaps I should say, the will and cap acity—of those other countries that have substantial stocks of refined produc ts to release them to us if we had another significant supply shock that affects re fined product capacity? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Well, I can’t speculate on how the domestic politics of this would play out in some of those countries.  The IEA [Interna tional Energy Agency] authorized the sale of 60    29 of 117million barrels from the strategic reserves of its members—30 million from us and 30 million from the others.  Most of what we were going to  release from the strategic petroleum reserve was crude; that’s all we store.   And in the bidding that took place for that oil, as of two or three days ago, 11 was the number of bids that were accepted, not 30.  So there’s some question in the minds of our staff experts on this about whether that means a second round and a third round will be done to eventually work up to the 30 million.  Or  is the thinking that maybe they don’t need to do all 30 million?  Of the 30 million that is to be d one from non-U.S. stocks, much of that will be product rather than crude oil, and much of it will  simply be sold into the market.  The global toward us. So, I think what we’re seeing is that they ha ve the oil and they have the product.  They could do more than what they’ve done, but what th ey’ve done so far has not stabilized the price.  And there is political resistance in Europe.  Now, I think that’s a bit naive in a sense.  If they don’t release more, presumably th e price would go even higher, ri ght?  The market is never going to be fragmented, and they’re always going to  feel the effect of our attempt to buy more gasoline.  But there’s the interplay of domestic us e versus selling it into the market and there’s pressure, particularly in Europe , regarding their gasoline taxes. And this is where I think the essence of the fight is being waged right now.  Most people who are ar guing about the long-run interests of rational energy po licy in the EU [European Uni on] Commission and anybody who is a bit above the politics is sayi ng, “Whatever you do, don’t cut the ga soline taxes.”  But some of the actual governments who face the electorate a bit more directly ha ve caved already.  Others of them are going to postpone planned incr eases.  Some of them are wavering.      30 of 117If they go the route of trying to protec t their domestic populations by temporarily lowering taxes and so forth, my guess is that  they won’t be putti ng the gasoline into a distribution that would appear to  be bailing out the Americans at the expense of the French farmer.  That isn’t going to happen.  They will try to protect their stocks and they will try to segment the market.  So I wouldn’t count on that as a big source of transitory relief on price pressure—more than we have already seen—beca use I think the politics of it is getting very complicated. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. MR. SANTOMERO. David, I want to talk a little bit about how the Board’s modeling incorporates higher oil prices on output produced elsewhere and im ported into the United States.  Is it just through import prices alone? The reason I ask is that we’ve spent a lot of time talking about the f act that higher energy costs haven’t really impacted us as much as ot her countries.  We’ve give n two reasons for it.  One is that we’re more energy-efficient.  The second is that the output we produce is less energy-intensive. Presumably, our actual consumption hasn’t shifted as much as our production, which means that more of the energy-intensive output is being produced externally  and shipped into the United States. Now, that would presumably mean that energy-intensive goods would have higher prices because of the global price of oil, and import prices would go up to a greater extent than before because of the shift in mix.  Yet the forecast has import prices falling.  How does that all work its way through?  What’s that dynamic? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Well, regrettably it’s not David’s problem.  It’s mine.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Maybe we’ll get two answers!        31 of 117MS. JOHNSON. Let me take it in two halves.  I’ll talk a little about global energy use, and then we’ll come to the import price part. We model energy demand, energy consumption, energy production, and the implied change in inventories on a global basis. And we do it using all of the information we can muster.  But it is understood by the people in that world th at there is a lack of good information.  There has been an outcry for more transparency about  energy production and en ergy capacity than now exists. Some of the volatility that President Fisher was speaking to derives from the fact that when the IEA makes an announcement of a change  in their estimate of what demand was last year it will move the market. So, the quality of the information that is available for the global troubled political areas where being transparent about anything is not  in their interest, so they don’t provide data. So that adds to the complexity.   But we have an oil model and we use a lot of judgment—the add f actors that David was talking about—and we attempt to account for tota l oil production in essence by country.  It’s not that we think any individual number in that mix is going to be right in any sense, but we try to be consistent through the story. So we start with the futures curve for WTI, and we make some judgments about the spreads on th ings like Dubai and ot her oils that loom large in the global And given that we have relied on the futures mark ets—basically for want of  a view that we could do better than the futures market—supply becomes th e residual.  So we have forecasts of global demand of GDP.  And we have di fferent weights that apply to those that are the oil-using weights as opposed to the trade weights or th e GDP weights that we might use other places.    32 of 117Now, part of your question was how often we change those weights and how sensitive we are to the shifts in production that are taking place in the world.  I can’t speak to that specifically, but in general we revise our wei ghts every year.  It’s not as if we have weights from 1970 and we just keep cranking away using those weights. We’v e gone to this variable weight approach as in the GDP and everything else. So, we specificall y do at least attempt to take account of how different countries use energy versus how other things happen.  We have a set of energy-using weights that we apply to world GDP, and that gives us, in esse nce, a different aggregate for world growth than if we were doing it for some other purpose, which we do. So we’ve got a price and we’ve got demand, a nd we back out supply; supply becomes the residual. For example, two years ago when prices seemed to us to be rather high, we were inferring a need for supply to pull back in order to sustain those prices.  And OPEC has played that role—Saudi Arabia, in particular.  Go b ack and read Greenbooks from two to three years ago, and we had a story about expecting supply to contract in certa in places in order for futures curve prices to be realized, as oil suppliers target prices, and so forth. That has not been so true lately. Indee d, we’ve been tapping capacity increasingly over the last two years. And the noti on that global supply was more th an enough to explain the prices we were seeing has flipped to become a question of where we are going to  get the extra supply. For a time Russia and the FSU [Former Soviet Union] were a big source of extra non-OPEC supply. That seems to have changed more recently.  So, there is a supply story that tries to take these things into account that ma tches demand and the futures curve to give a crude oil picture.  And it has to account for enough barrels to make th at true.  If we were  to run into a real     33 of 117contradiction there, we would have to go b ack and say something to  ourselves about our assessment of demand. We take that picture, and for the United States—particularly this time more so than most—we have to ask questions about domestic cap acity to supply the resi dual part.  Would that have to be imported?  And what would be the mi x of those imports?  So we try to make all of that fit.  That leaves us then with an oil import price which can move differently than global crude prices because of the mix factor.  And the oil import price is what feeds into the domestic economy and then drives the elements of pass- through and domestic production and so forth. Now, in our forecast of import prices the oi l price portion is distinct from the non-oil portion, and it is non-oil import pric es that in the projection come down.  Those prices have been kicked around hugely by natural gas and by non-oil primary commoditie s.  We have now internally, but we don’t put it in the Greenbook, import prices less natural gas as a check on whether we are fully incorporati ng what we think is happening to natural gas.  But we don’t have a comparable setup for the supply and demand balan ce of natural gas that we have for oil, and the natural gas that would be relevant, obviously, is for North America as an almost isolated But we are thinking that we might have to do something about the quantity of natural gas because it’s a hidden uncerta inty in the overall non-oil import pr ice, and it’s uncomfortable that we haven’t been able to have  a better control over that. Even so, the non-oil, non-energy primary commod ities have been the big story in import prices; they caused the import pric es to move up.  And the fact that those futures markets are telling us that those prices have  peaked or are even coming down is what lies behind our forecast       34 of 117that import prices are decelerati ng yet again—and to very low leve ls in 2006 and into 2007.  That outlook is really a combination of what we th ink the non-energy futures markets are telling us about commodity prices and the maintained assu mption we make about the dollar.  Either of those things could change, and the forecast is completely conditional on them, with the added wrinkle of this role of natura l gas that is embedded in non-oi l import prices, but which probably should be separated out. Now, at least in terms of  the work we do, we try to do that partially but

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Other questions? If not, who would like to start? President Moskow.

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ov erall, the fundamentals in the Seventh District continue to improve, although we are still underperforming the national economy.  Prior to Katrina, most of our contacts  thought that their businesses were  expanding at rates consistent with the long-run trends in their industries. One exception was the motor vehicle sector.  The size of the drop in sales in August was a disappoin tment to automakers, but not a surprise.  They also complained about the effect of gasoline pr ices on demand, particular ly the shift in sales away from big SUVs toward more fuel -efficient but less profitable models.  When we asked our contacts about the impact of Hurricane Katrina, they reported several different kinds of effects. Some  noted increased activity in respons e to the storm.  A number of firms in our District received orders for items such as RVs, construction materials, heavy equipment, and appliances.  And Ford said that  they were looking at increasing their fourth-quarter production schedules to re place vehicles destroyed by the hurricane.  But we also heard some concerns that Katrina was depressing demand.  For instance, two of our national retail     35 of 117contacts noted some decline in activity, whic h they attributed to higher energy prices, uncertainty, and a CNN effect. High- and low-end stores were reported to be doing okay, but specialty retailers were taking a hit. Katrina also has led to some cost increases in our District.  Grai n elevators are paying more to work through transportation disruptions a nd to dry crops in storage.  We also heard concerns that the diversion of resources to the Gulf Coast will drive up the cost of construction materials and skilled tradesmen throughout the country.  And several contac ts noted increases in costs for fuels, fertilizer, and shipping. Of cour se, not all of the cost increases we have been hearing about are related to Katr ina.  Indeed, a major retailer and one of our temporary help contacts commented that wage pressures had increased notably at the national level.   Turning to the national outlook, the data we  had in hand prior to  Hurricane Katrina pointed to a solid expansion in activity.  We all know  how devastating Katrina was in terms of the misery it caused the people of the Gulf Coast.  Nonetheless, although the uncertainty is great, the hurricane’s effects on the national economy likely will be short-lived.  Even in the near term, the Greenbook baseline projection doesn’t have Katrina reducing GDP growth below trend; and certainly by early next year the hurricane should have a net positive effect for growth, given the large federal spending coming on line. With regard to inflation, the July and Augus t readings on core pri ces were good, but even so the Greenbook forecast for core PCE inflation next year has been raised to 2¼ percent.  Last time many of us were concerned that core infl ation was running at the upper end of the range consistent with price stability, and now the ou tlook has deteriorated.  As discussed in the       36 of 117Greenbook, and as we were talking about earlier, one major reason for this increase in the inflation forecast is the exp ected pass-through of higher ener gy and distribution costs. Another important risk is faster compensa tion growth.  Both compensation per hour and the ECI are projected to increase significantly next year, and this seems consistent with the anecdotes I noted earlier about wage pressures.  These pressures are of particular concern at this stage of the cycle because we can ’t expect continued outsized gains in pro ductivity to hold down unit labor costs. Some cost increases may be absorbed by lower profit ma rgins, but there is a risk that they may show up in higher prices as well. With the outlook for inflation already higher, and with so much liquidity in the financial system, the cost of excessive policy accommodation c ould be significant.  So at this point, we should continue to increase rates until they are safely in the neutral zone.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Guynn. MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Obvi ously, our Atlanta Bank’s attention these past three weeks has been riveted on Hurricane Ka trina and its aftermath, because of both our operational responsibilities in the areas affected by the storm and our concerns about the welfare of our New Orleans staff.  In addition, we ha ve been trying to contribute to our collective understanding of the policy implications  of the storm and its aftermath.   Let me first take this opportunity to thank our  colleagues here in Washington and at all of the Reserve Banks for the extrao rdinary support you have given us over the past three weeks and for the contributions some of you and many of  your staff members ha ve sent for our New Orleans staff relief fund to help some of our  most desperate employees.  Also, it’s my understanding that we have borrowed employees from  at least seven other Reserve Banks to help          37 of 117us with the processing of New Orleans checks in A tlanta.  And our sister banks in Dallas and St. Louis and the Cash Product Office in San Francisc o have gone to extraordinary lengths to help us meet the cash needs of the hurricane-affected areas. Fortunately, we have accounted for all but one  of our 176 New Orleans staff.  Our staff members now, amazingly, are spread across 12 states , living with friends a nd relatives and trying to restart their lives. It’s not cl ear at this point when we’ll be ab le to restart operations out of the New Orleans office. We have sorted through the various dimensions of the impact of the storm and could cite much in the form of detailed st atistics and anecdotal evidence.  That descriptive information has already been shared with the Board staff and others around the System, so let me use my time to focus on our views of the most  important policy implications of what has happened. In the end, we believe—if past experience is any guide—that while there will be a hit to output, the natural inclination of people to rebuild residences and businesses will begin to kick in more quickly than one might expect.  And this will be supported by the inflow of insurance payments and the substantial federal aid that th e President has promised, as we have already talked about. We do believe that this will begi n sooner in Mississippi, which does not have to contend with the flooding that will delay progress in New Orleans.  In fact, our directors from Mississippi indicate that as  early as last week deals were being done and aggressive cleanup and even some major repair work had already started.  From this perspe ctive then, we believe the lost output, as is the case in the forecast in th e Greenbook, will be made up reasonably quickly. My greater concern is on the implications for prices from the damage of the area’s infrastructure, which includes oil and gas platform s, rail lines, intermodal transportation, bridges,        38 of 117refineries, pipelines, and natural gas processing faci lities.  These facilities  are critical to the production and distribution of energy and energy-related products fo r the nation as a whole.  The damage has already been seen, as oil and natura l gas prices have spike d, and we believe there will be important impacts on both headline and core  inflation measures.  These will result from the ripple effects stemming mainly from the supply shock to the prices of oil and gas, refined products, transportation, and building materials.  In addition, the promised federal spending will help to fuel demand for labor in the area and for construction materials as well as other go ods and services that ar e already in short supply and will be needed for the rebuilding.  As some one else has already indicated, this increased demand will clearly add to short-term price pressures that will exte nd beyond the South.  How significant and how long-lasting these price e ffects will be is stil l very uncertain. For example, we don’t know how long the suppl y problem, particularly for natural gas, will last. Despite what has been reported elsewhere, our on-the-ground sources state that a large part of the pipeline system that moves oil and ga s from the wells to processing facilities has yet to be inspected for damage, so we just can’t yet know how long it will be  until normal operations resume.  And as Karen noted, this uncertainty may be exacerbated by Hurricane Rita, which is now on a projected path that woul d take it through some of the o ffshore gas and oil fields that were not severely hit by Katrina. Our own sens e is that the implications of the natural gas disruption and its associated pri ce run-up have not been given suffi cient attention.  While natural gas reserves are reported to have b een in the normal seasonal range prior to Katrina, there is little or no capacity to make up for the near-term shortfalls, as could be done with oil.     39 of 117The chairman of my board of directors, who heads the holding company of the major electric power company serving the Southeast, told  me just yesterday that if natural gas prices remain as high as futures markets suggest, the consumer is in for a huge hit in coming months.  He suggests that not only will homeowners be shocked at their bills for natural gas this winter, particularly if we have a cold wi nter, but that electric utility rates are in for a big jump, as state regulatory agencies eventually approve the pass-t hrough increase in generati on costs attributed to high natural gas prices. We know that virtually all of the new el ectric-generating facilities built in the last couple of deca des were designed with natural gas as the preferred fuel.  Just as higher gasoline prices seem to have finally hit home w ith consumers, these coming jolts from natural gas and electric bills could well show through to inflation expecta tions, in our view.  While some of these supply and price shocks will likely be transito ry, and energy supply problems should ease a bit as pumping capacity in re fineries comes back on line, they will still last for several months before reverting to levels that we think are likely to be a bit higher than pre-Katrina levels. These increased energy pric es will show through markedly, most markedly in the broad headline inflation measures.  But we also think we will see some significant feed-through effects to core prices. Large industrial users of natural gas, like the building materials company Georgia-Pacific, whose president is on our Atlanta board, are al ready feeling the huge cost pressures from high natural gas prices and have become more determined than ever to pass on some of those costs.  Another of our directors with worldwide responsibility for Dow Chemical indicates that prices for petrochemical feeder stock from o il and gas are already up 20 to 40 percent and will soon be felt across a wide array of plastic products  and industrial chemicals.  Another director      40 of 117who runs a major trucking firm indicates that her costs are going through the roof, and fuel surcharges are now the norm.  The anecdotal information is that customers are more readily accepting these increased costs, which are now be ing passed on more readily rather than being limited by competitive pressures.  For these reasons,  we are not nearly as sanguine about either the short-term or long-term implications for prices as the Greenbook. Putting all of this together, we believe, as the Greenbook clearly lays out, that the economy went into Katrina with considerable momentum.  And l ooking past the next six months or so, we think the hit to near-term aggregate gr owth will be more than offset by the stimulus associated with deployment of private and public funds to rebuild. The maturity of the expansion pre-Katrina was underscored by a report from one of our regular temporary employment agency contacts who reported that they are now seeing shortages in several markets in a number of skilled and unskilled jobs.  In fact, they have raised wages by $2.50 an hour in several categories. While I th ink one might make the case today for a pause from our policy path, it is the case that signifi cant monetary accommodation is already in place.  And we have more fiscal policy support to come in targeted federal spending for hurricane relief. I am most concerned about the pressure on pric es.  While some of this will be short-lived, I don’t think those higher inflation number s will go unnoticed by either businesses or individuals. And I think this co uld begin to cause some deterior ation in inflation expectations, which remained reasonably well contained until r ecently.  At the same time, I don’t want us to appear to be overreacting to the short-term supply shock to prices; that may make it seem that we think we’ve gotten behind the curve. I believe the best way to ensure that expectations don’t become unraveled is to continue on our present policy path for a bi t longer.  I think this means—     41 of 117as hard as it is for me, coming from our area , to say—that we should increase our fed funds target rate by another 25 basi s points today and be very carefu l about the communication that we craft to go with that announcement.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Third District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Consumer spending for general merchandise has edged up.  Retailers report that back-to-school  shopping got off to a slow start in  August, but attributed it to exceptionally warm weather, which hindered the sale  of fall merchandise.  Auto sales have been brisk, with dealers in the regi on reporting continuing high rates of  sales in August, except for large SUVs. Employment is rising steadily in the region, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than in the nation.  While the regional unemployment ra te ticked up in July from its second-quarter level, it remains lower than the national rate. Housing markets remained strong in the Distri ct, with sales conti nuing at a high rate.  Price appreciation continues at a steady pace, but se veral of our contacts noted that higher-priced homes appear to be taking longer to sell now than earlier this y ear.  The nonresidential market continues to improve, with cons truction contracts up and office l easing active.  The demand for commercial space continues to expand at a sl ow but steady pace in Philadelphia.  Although vacancy rates remain high, we have seen pos itive net absorption of  office space for seven consecutive quarters. Re ntal rates remain steady. Recent manufacturing activity in the District has been softer than we saw earlier this year. The index of general activity in the manufacturing survey rebounded in August but fell again in September to a positive 2.2, indicating virtually flat manufacturing activity in the     42 of 117District this month. The downwar d trend in our index since the beginning of the year is echoed by a number of the regional manufacturing indexes as well as the national purchasing managers’ index. There was also a significant drop in the re spondents’ expectations about future activity.  There were still more firms expecting an incr ease in activity over the next six months than expecting a decline, but the per centage of respondents expecting a decline doubled in September.  I should point out, however, that the survey was ta ken in the days early af ter the Katrina event, and that likely had something to do with the large drop.  We’ll have to look forward to the next couple of months. Perhaps the most notable and troubling info rmation from our latest survey is the significant increase in price indexe s.  The prices paid index show ed its strongest increase since 1973 and is at its highest level si nce January.  The index for prices  received also moved higher. Expectations about future prices were also considerably higher this month. Concerns about inflation are not limited to  our manufacturers.  While the economic impact of the hurricane has been slight in our District—and our business c ontacts expect further improvement in our regional economy—the loss  of petroleum products and production in the facilities in the Gulf of Mexico has prompted a sharp rise in in flation concerns in many of our firms. Turning to the national outlook, as the Gree nbook noted, incoming data on the national economy pre-Katrina indicated th at the expansion was continui ng on a solid footing, with GDP growth slightly higher than potential. Labor mark ets continued to improve, with little or no slack remaining.  Consumers continued to spend at a good pace despite elevated oil and gasoline      43 of 117prices. While there was some softening in the most recent orders and shipments data, this reflected the usual month-to-month volatilit y, and business spending remained healthy. Higher energy prices were showing through to headline inflation, but so far had little impact on core inflation.  If Katrina hadn’t happ ened, it is my view that a decision to continue our strategy to remove monetary policy accommod ation would have been relatively easy.  But Katrina did happen. The hurricane is a human tragedy, as was noted, and it has changed the near-term outlook for the economy.  I commend the Greenbook staff for the careful discussion and analysis of the potential effects on both growth and inflation. I acknowle dge that there is a wi der band of uncertainty around the forecasts than there had been.  Howeve r, as a baseline forecast, I think the Greenbook has it largely right.  Certainly, Katrina will have  a substantial impact on the Gulf of Mexico’s regional economy for many months to come.  It al so has a potentially wider national scope than other natural disasters.  Because of the disruption in the energy and shipping sectors, it will have ramifications for the rest of the economy. The destruction of the physical wealth a nd oil infrastructure and the disruption in economic activity will temporarily reduce the growth of the national economy and add to inflation over the near term. Monthly data ove r the next couple of months are going to be weaker than we’d like to see, and our headline inflation numbers are going to be higher than we would like. But these effects are likely te mporary.  The cleanup has already begun, as was noted, and rebuilding efforts funded by public and private spending will a dd to baseline growth in the fourth quarter and into next year.         44 of 117As the energy infrastructure is rebuilt and the energy markets stabilize, much of the run-up of inflation should reverse as well. Of course, a longer-run negative imp act is not out of the realm of possibility, but I think we will see a re versal of the sharp run-up in oil and gasoline prices after the hurricane season. That, al ong with the good economic prospects, the good progress going forward to get the oil and refinery capacity back on line, and the improvement in governmental response after a troublesome be ginning will all help mitigate these longer-run impacts. The relevant policy options for us to consid er at this point are whether to continue removing policy accommodation or to take a pause.   I would argue that the prudent course of action today is to remain on our previous path, i.e., to continue to move rates up gradually.  There are ample fundamental reasons for such a policy action.  “We are at a whisker from potential output,” to quote a recent comment  by President Yellen.  I like that comment—“a whisker.” [Laughter] And I continue to be concerned about inflat ionary pressures.  The higher energy prices we saw even before Katrina add to the concern. And we now have a significant increase in the amount of fiscal stimulus in the pipeline, as was discussed, which has the potential to keep pressure on inflation elevated for some time, even after energy price increas es subside.  I would also note the apparent increase in near-term in flation expectations.  The recently released University of Michigan Survey, discussed earlier and in our briefing documents, shows a fairly hefty increase in both short- and medium-term exp ectations of inflation—a fact worthy of our attention.       45 of 117Finally, I believe that continuing to redu ce policy accommodation would be the best way to underscore to both the markets and the public our belief that Katrina will not change the underlying economic fundamentals and that the negative impact on growth will be temporary.  Markets generally expect a rate increase today, so  I believe that move w ould not be disruptive. By contrast, pausing today will do little to im prove the temporary effects on growth of Katrina, which is largely a supply shock. And if we do pause today on the grounds that Katrina has made the short-run economic outlook uncertain, I think it will be very difficult for us to resume raising rates in the short term.  Economic data coming in over the next couple of months on production, employment, and consumer spending are likely to be weak because of hurricane effects. Trying to craft a statement to explain wh y we are raising rates in the midst of weak data, after pausing now, would be a daunt ing task.  So if we pause toda y, I think we have to consider that we will be on hold for a while, perhaps even as long as to the beginning of next year.  In my mind, this poses an unacceptable risk that we will find ourselves behind the curve.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, the Texas economy is faring better than the national economy.  Pre-Katrina we saw very strong evidence of  that in all nine of what we call our super sectors in the economy—includi ng, by the way, the information and telecom sectors, which suffered serious setbacks in the bursting of th e dot-com bubble and the reversal, coming out of the recession in 2003. Post-Katrina data are likely to  be stronger still.  Despite or  perhaps because of the unique position that we’re in geographically, 265,000 peopl e from the area affected by Katrina have          46 of 117evacuated to the state of Texas.  We expect about 40,000 of them to stay, and that’s above and beyond Jack’s employees to whom we’ve tried very hard to be helpful.  The way our economy will improve in the afterm ath of the hurricane is by increasing the convention business, for example, that has been displaced into Dallas.  And the port of Houston will have increased activity.  We’ll see what happe ns with this storm that’s brewing presently.  Our office and business relocation efforts are ru nning full bore, and throughout the state we’re getting commitments already from people who have been displaced along the Gulf Coast. Our data show greater business optimism than is seen nationwide.  Our bankers are very frisky. [Laughter] As one of them, the CEO of the largest bank in our Di strict, put it the other day, “loan demand is stronger than horseradish.” And it just continues onward. One concern I would note is that economic conditions in Mexico  are worse than we expected, and—a point to make about the Greenbook—we’re less optimistic th an the Board staff about the second half of the year. There seems to have been an implos ion in domestic demand in Mexico.  We’re also concerned about some developments in the bu ilding materials sector for cement, wood, and steel—we’re seeing significant evidence of the ho arding of lumber, for example—and how that might affect construction activity in our state.  We are, at least in Northern Texas, second to Atlanta in terms of housing star ts, although fortunately not subject  to significant upward price pressures. On the national anecdotal side, this has been an  aggressive period for us in that we talked to as many CEOs—many with firms headquartered  in our District—and ot her business contacts as we could. We spoke with a total of 15 CEOs for this roun d, one COO in retailing—everybody knows who that is—several CFOs, and many direct ors from banks and other boards of different       47 of 117sizes and dimensions of conventional companies.  So I’d like to summarize very quickly what we heard. The retailers, from the conveni ence store operator who is headqua rtered in our District to the largest retailer, emphasized  two points.  First, $3.00 per gallon gasoline seems to be the tipping point in terms of having an impact on consumption.  Whether Katrina is directly related to that or not, the point is that one gets from these retailers evidence of a falling off of demand and, very importantly, a bifurcati on of demand.  By the latter I m ean that the higher-end retailers like Nieman Marcus continue to do well while the lower- and middle-end retailers suffer.  Second, there has been a change in product choi ce, with a move from branded products to unbranded products. My favorite example provi ded to me in this call-around was the substitution of Gold Coast cigarettes for Marl boros.  There’s a $2.50 per pack difference, and retailers, particularly 7-Eleven, are seeing significantly  higher sales of the lower-priced brand. The price pressures that are coming in reta il are in areas one w ould expect—plastics, packaging, transportation—and there is evidence  of price pressures beginning to build.  I understand that Wal-Mart executives  have called in the CEOs of a ll their suppliers and told them that Wal-Mart will not accept fu rther cost through-puts.  But the company indicated that they will work together with their suppliers to achie ve efficiencies.  Whether that experiment will succeed or not is another question. On energy, we have what we call a SWOT t eam—we replace the A with an O, which is for oil—that includes the largest integrated comp any down to some smaller gas producers.  I’ve been sending around some notes to my co-Presi dents on what we have learned from these sources, for whatever they’re worth.  The bottom line there really comes down to natural gas and      48 of 117gasoline prices. There are 25 ship s at sea presently bringing in product, meaning gasoline.  And the expectation is not so much a direct price movement based on Katrina but increased volatility, as we talked about earlier, depe ndent on whether or not the winter  turns out to be a cold one.  That’s what the producers are lookin g at in terms of the real side  of the business as opposed to the speculative side of the business. The effects are working their way through chem icals, and these are effects that don’t come to mind readily.  You can only take a natura l gas molecule and divide it in so many ways.  Our chemicals people are telling us, for example,  that they don’t yet ha ve the leeway to pass through prices on things like nitr ogen and hydrogen and other chem icals that we ordinarily don’t think about but that are important to the chemical production proce ss.  But as one said: “We are going to look for every way we can to pass on prices there.” Regarding the shipping and rails, the largest barge company in the c ountry gave us this statistic: 300 to 400 barges out of 15,000 to 16,000 were affected by developments in the Mississippi related to Katrina.  Bu t it was “no big deal except for an impact at the margin.”  We received a similar report from the CEO of one of the larger of the five railroad companies.  One thing that everybody in the transpor tation business talks about that they applaud politically is the waiving of the Jones Act.  The estimate is that it will cut intercoastal transportation costs by ship by half, which is obviousl y not insignificant. As far as express delivery is concerned, the key factor there in terms of ground transportation is whether or not the U.S. mail will move  up its prices; the expectation is for a 5.4 percent increase in January.  On the auto side, as President Moskow reported, Ford is probably feeling more frisky—just to use that term again—and GM is as well.  It’s interesting to look at        49 of 117the used auto auctions for Manheim and Adessa, th e two largest wholesale us ed car auctioneers.  There was a big spike in prices  post-Katrina.  If you do the ma th, whether 100,000 cars or even more were lost from hurricane damage, this shou ld be of assistance to the auto companies. As far as technology is concerned, TI reports the ability to pass on some price increases in their broad semiconductor business.  But again, all the tech folks, whet her it’s Dell or EDS, report continued pressure to lower prices and to outsource and new source their employee base. On housing, I have reported on the hoarding of lumber.  There is another interesting development, which is the disappearance of cont ractors and subcontractors from our state—and apparently from Florida, Jack—because they are rushing to New Orleans to cash in on the money that is going to be spent there. In summary, the comments from our bus iness contacts on Katrin a, while acknowledging the human tragedy and the tremendous displacem ent of people and property, range from “no impact” to “short-term shiver” to “sporadic impact .”  And as cold-hearted as it may seem, this comes down to the issue of where we are today.  Th e way I have thought about it is that I believe there will be less of an income statement impact but more of a balance sheet impact, which is something I worry about.  What I mean by that is that perhaps we will see a temporary setback in terms of growth, a shifting in th e complexion of that growth, and, to be sure, addi tional volatility and potential price increases. But what I worry about most, Mr. Chairman, is what I have come to refer to as the fiscal inc ontinence of the government.  That  is, I worry about money being thrown at a problem and whether or not that will undermine the confidence that we depend on to finance our economic growth.       50 of 117I’m reminded of a story that George Shu ltz told me about his time working under President Reagan, who was very frustrated about spending.  George picked up the phone and called I think it was Sam Cohen a nd said, “Tell me, Sam, is ther e really any difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending?”  And Cohen said, “I want to think about it, do some research, and gi ve you a serious answer.”  He ca lled back the next morning and said, “Yes, George, there is. De mocrats enjoy it more.” [Laughter ]  “But otherwis e there doesn’t appear to be any difference.” I want to vote for a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate.  I agree with President Santomero’s point about confidence.  I worry ab out the price pressures that are building, but I also think it’s very, very importa nt that regardless of the amount of additional fiscal stimulus— whether it’s $85 billion or more—t hat we not be viewed as being tempted in any way, shape, or form, to monetize that fiscal spending, whether it’s incontinence or profligacy.  I would suggest also, Mr. Chairman—and this  may seem odd—the possibility of looking at the language in our statement, which I think Jack mentioned obliquely, and whether or not we want to continue with the term “measured pa ce.”  Has it run its c ourse?  Has it become synonymous with a 25 basis point increase or not ?  And might we not use Katrina as an opportunity to decouple that link in order to provide us greater flexib ility going forward?  But, in summary, I am in favor of continuing to re move policy accommodation.  Thank you very much.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Yellen. MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   It goes without saying that the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina has elicited a deep sens e of empathy in our District.  In terms of the    51 of 117economic effects, we’re paying special attention to  energy and international trade.  So far, at least, the effects on the Tw elfth District economy appear  to have been muted. Since the end of August, reta il gasoline prices are up about  30 cents per gallon on the West Coast, less than elsewhere in the nation.  There was some early concern that Gulf Port cargo would be diverted to the West Coast, cr eating bottlenecks or si gnificantly increasing shipping costs, but these concer ns have largely dissipated. Our contacts remain fairly optimistic about  the prospects for the regional economy but are very concerned about the futu re path of energy prices, especi ally since Hurricane Katrina.  Even before the hurricane, they were worried  that higher gasoline  prices and impending increases in home heating expe nses would curb consumer demand.  Indeed, PG&E, the public utility for northern California,  just announced that rising natu ral gas prices could drive home heating costs in the area up by as much as 40 percent this winter.  Discount retailers in the District expect these in creases to put a dent in holiday spe nding.  In addition, higher fuel prices already have trickled into prices for buildi ng materials, and contact s expect post-hurricane rebuilding efforts to boost those prices fu rther and lengthen queues on some orders. Turning to the national economy, I share th e Greenbook’s assessment of the near-term impact of Hurricane Katrina on economic growth. Pre-Katrina, the outlook was for very strong growth in the second half of 2005.  It now s eems likely that second- half growth will be substantially reduced due to the disruptions to production in the Gulf region and the negative impact of the run-up in energy prices on consum er spending.  Of course, over this time frame there’s little that monetary polic y can do to affect actual outcomes.         52 of 117While the proposed policy statement asso ciated with alternative B acknowledges increased uncertainty about economic performa nce in the near term, I believe that the uncertainties associated with the medium-term outlook have also risen substantially, and risks now exist that in my view pose a clear and pe rsistent threat.  On the upside, rebuilding commitments are escalating by the day.  The reco very and bounceback fueled by massive fiscal stimulus could more than make up for the slow down this winter, prope lling the economy on an unsustainable upward trajectory similar to the optimistic scenario laid out in the Greenbook.  But downside risks to growth also loom.  Rebuilding schedules could easily slip. Moreover, the pace of restarting cl osed oil and natural gas platfo rms and rigs in the Gulf of Mexico has leveled off, and the prognosis for rest arting the remaining closed facilities as well as refineries and natural gas treatment plants remains in question.  If disrupt ions persist or further shocks to supply occur, the economy could deve lop more along the line s of the pessimistic scenario in the Greenbook. Moreover, we may not  yet have seen the full brunt on spending of the pre-Katrina energy price increases.  It’s soberi ng to note that in the postwar period, the U.S. economy has rarely escaped such severe run-ups in oil prices without suffering a significant downturn. Turning to inflation, I was quite concerned at  our August meeting by th e elevated rate of core PCE inflation, which was skirting the top of  my comfort zone.  Since that meeting, I’ve become more confident that core inflation re mains well contained.  Recent data on core price inflation have been encouraging. Core PCE pric es have risen at a 1½ pe rcent rate over the six months through July, right in the middle of my pr eferred range, and core CPI inflation has also been well behaved. I’m also encouraged by read ings on wage growth from the employment cost        53 of 117index and from the household survey, a series th at our research staff has recently started compiling and tracking.  These remain remarkably  subdued.  The elevated rate of growth in compensation per hour from the productivity and cost  report over the past year far exceeds the readings provided by these other series and may be  more an outlier than a strong signal of tight labor markets and wage pressures. While my comfort level with respect to core inflation has improved since August, the Board’s staff has raised the Greenbook forecast of core PCE price inflation in 2006 by 0.2 of a percentage point to 2.3 percent due to the run-up  in energy prices since the August meeting.  I must say that I actually found the low-inflati on alternative simulation in the Greenbook more compelling.  This scenario assumes that infla tion expectations remain well anchored, and it shows core inflation falling over the ne xt two years, reaching 1½ percent in 2007. On that point, the relative st ability of longer-term  break-even inflati on rates derived from the TIPS market this year, even as oil prices surged, provides evidence that the public remains confident in the Committee’s commitment to price stability.  Of course, the jump in inflation expectations seen in this mont h’s preliminary Michigan survey was worrisome, but we must be cautious not to read too much into that repo rt since it was taken so  soon after Katrina. To assess the likely pass-through of energy in to core consumer in flation, our staff has estimated Phillips curve type forecasting models  akin to those employed at the Board.  An important finding emerges.  Changes in real oil pr ices did have an economically and statistically significant effect on core inflation, but only up to  the early 1980s.  Importantly for the current situation, they find no evidence of such a relation ship in the data since the early ’80s.  The critical difference between the pre- and post-198 0s experience probably relates to the public’s         54 of 117inflation expectations.  During the 1970s, they became unmoored from price stability but now appear to be well anchored, as in the Greenbook’s low inflation scenario. With respect to policy, I support a 25 basis poi nt rate increase rather  than a pause today.  A pause at this meeting justified by a need to furt her assess Katrina’s impact  would be sensible if we actually expected to know a lot more a bout the medium-term outlook by November, but that’s unlikely to be the case. A pause could counterproductively mislead market participants about the likely future path of policy or create the misi mpression that the Fed is unduly pessimistic about the outlook.  So I consider it wiser to stick with  our “measured pace” approach for now. I think it’s well justified by the Greenbook forecast, uncertain as it is, and consistent with market expectations.  But going forward, we obviously need to be flexible and adjust our views about where we’re ultimately heading on the basis of new data and forecasts.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chai rman.  For the past couple of meetings I’ve been reporting a lull in ec onomic activity in New England, w ith little employment growth and muted readings on confidence.  Perhaps it wa s the weather or the impact of the Pentagon’s base realignment and closure (BRAC) proposals on fragile labor markets such as those in Maine but, whatever it was, the region appeared to pull out of it in late July and make some further progress in August. The weather turned bright and sunny, tourists  filled the beaches, and hopes for fall tourism rose.  Employment surged by mo re than 13,000 jobs over the two months—that’s big in New England—with most broad industry categ ories showing gains.  Consumer confidence rose, as did business confidence. And th e BRAC Commission decided not to follow the Pentagon’s recommendation to close two major bases in the region.          55 of 117With the exception of commercial real estate, which remains in the doldrums in Boston, the outlook turned positive overall, with most contacts expecting con tinued growth for the remainder of 2005 and into 2006.  But, of course, this was pre-Katrina.  Since that devastating disaster, we’ve tried hard to  understand the impact on the re gion and the nation.  Our small business advisory group met as scheduled the week after the hurricane hit, as did our board of directors. At that point things, indeed, seemed gloomy.  But as the recovery effort got on a better footing, the underlying resilience of the U.S. economy began to show through. To capture a sense of this changing scene, we made calls late last week to large national retailers and manufacturers headqu artered in the First District.  Overall there were several common themes.  First, most contacts believed the pace of underlying growth had been solid and was likely to stay that way, with some negative hurricane effects this qua rter and next but some positive impact thereafter.  Indeed, one of our directors whose company is a large manufacturer of semiconductor chips reported worldwide e xpansion on the heels of a major inventory drawdown during the first half of the year. He reported semiconductor plants everywhere working at an 85 to 90 percent capacity most recently, with strong demands for PCs and hand sets driving chip production. A major regiona l bank with offices throughout New England and the eastern Midwest and down to Philadelphia reported that give n the yield curve, the banking business had been a bit tough, but most bank customers seemed to be doing great.  This bank and other employers reported increasing problems in finding skilled labor, even people to fill teller positions. Second, while Katrina’s devasta tion was terrible, our contacts  were especially concerned about the effect of high oil, ga soline, and natural gas prices on  their input costs for oil-based       56 of 117materials and on consumer pocketbooks.  Consumer prices in the Boston area were on the rise prior to Katrina, with the region’s headline rate of  inflation at 4 percent and core at 3 percent. The biggest area of price growth even then was for fuel and utilities, which rose almost twice as fast as nationwide over the 12 months from July ’04 to July ’05.  Given the region’s lack of homegrown energy supplies, its re liance on oil for home heating purposes, and the fact that over half of its electrical generators  are now fired by natural gas brought  in from outside the region, it seems clear that Boston price growth, driven by en ergy costs, will continue to outstrip the nation at least through the winter months.  Moreove r, a pre-Katrina Fede ral Energy Regulatory Commission report, which I think I’v e talked about before, sees the region’s power supply at risk of widespread brownouts this winter if very cold  weather puts stress on generators working at capacity. More broadly, contacts  also reported that Katrina’s impact on energy costs may give them cover for price increases that prior to Katrina they’ve lacked the power to make stick. The third common theme related to the po ssible upside potential for reconstruction-related demand in 2006.  Manufact urers of capital goods and cons umer durables anticipate a hurricane-related uptick next year.  Companies with stores  and manufacturing or major distribution points in the hurrica ne area will have some losses, though most expect them to be covered by insurance. And one la rge retailer reported that while 7 to 10 out of its 120 stores in the region appeared to be total losses, business was extremely strong at stores just outside the devastated areas, such as in Baton Rouge. Th at company has been moving employees in the affected areas to stores in areas where busine ss is booming.  A supplier of capital goods to the defense industry was concerned that the spe nding on recovery from Katrina could squeeze out       57 of 117other defense spending but they, on balance, thought the probability wa s that sales to the government and other major contractor s might be delayed but not canceled. Finally, there was a theme of outreach and support to employees in the affected area and of helping with disaster recovery. Almost all contacts were doing whatever they could— supplying generators and giving out  free medicine and other supplie s at evacuation locations.  In fact, one drugstore reported th at on a daily basis they were  handing out about $500,000 worth of free drugs. Supplying water puri fication equipment and technol ogy to restore communications was also noted. Most companies have continued to pay their personnel and have made efforts to locate them all.  Several have made grants to those who lost everything.  They expect insurance to cover some of this and perhaps some government reimbursement, but the general attitude seemed to be to do as much as they could and to worry about how to cover the costs later.  Just as within the Reserve Banks, the reported generosity of employees in areas beyond the hurricane was amazing, with one major company alone raising at least $17 million in donations to Katrina victims in the reconstruction efforts.  So it’s not just government money that’s going into the area. There’s a lot of money from everywhere. In sum, the New England economy seems on a stronger footing than it was earlier in the summer, though the dark clouds of rising energy cost s are almost certain to take a bite out of regional pocketbooks, especially if the winter is a cold one as is  predicted.  This likely would have been the case without Katrina, but the rela ted energy supply shock has made the short-term outlook a bit worse. Aside from energy, the economi c effect of Katrina seems likely to be small, certainly by comparison with the human effect.  By 2006, if energy costs moderate as predicted,       58 of 117the outlook could well be positive for the larger retailers and capital good s manufacturers in the region. Turning to the Greenbook, there is more th an the usual amount of uncertainty clouding the very near-term outlook.  We in Boston, probably like everybody else  around the table and elsewhere, have tried our hand at estimating the impact of Katrina.  But I can’t imagine that we’re any better at it than the Board staff is.  In  fact, despite the ups a nd downs in the quarter-to­quarter  projections, the Q4-over-Q4 GDP growth ra tes we see for both this  year and next differ from the Greenbook only marginally.  Our forecast for the unemployment rate is the same as the Greenbook’s and, given that we see a bit more  excess labor capacit y, we’re a little less pessimistic about increases in core inflation next year. So despite the near-term uncertainty, the me dium-term outlook seems less in question.  While it seemed impossible a couple of weeks a go, as we were all riveted to the horrifying scenes on national TV, Katrina’s effect on the economy is likely to be very short term—a slower pace now and a somewhat faster pace la ter as reconstruction takes place.  The real issue is what was happening pre-Katrina and how th at plays out going forward, and we have a somewhat greater sense of certainty  about that picture—or, I should say, the same level of certainty we have about any forecast.  Prior to Katrina most everything in the economy seemed to be running on all fours, though not wi thout some causes for concern.  Shipments data for July suggested some softness in P&E spe nding, and inventory rebuil ding at the wholesale level was less than expected, but labor markets had shown solid progress.  Financial markets had been and continued to be supportive of growth, if  a bit too complacent about risk for my taste.       59 of 117External growth was showing signs of life. A slowly closing output ga p and higher energy costs raised concerns both about inflation down the ro ad and possible negative effects on spending.   Assuming the instant effect of Katrina on en ergy prices moderates, the broad economic picture seems about the same as it was before the hurricane.  That is, the best guess is growth at around potential for the next year or so, lower unemployment as labor markets continue to tighten, and more rather than less pressure on prices.  Additional fiscal stimulus from Katrina recovery efforts could be a bit of a wild card he re, as there seems to be a growing tendency to throw money at the problem—money we can ill a fford, given medium-term deficit expectations. Don’t get me wrong.  I think the federal governmen t should help in the rebuilding process, but it has to be done in the context of  overall fiscal discipline, which at  this point seems a bit lacking. There are surely risks to the forecast.  On the downside, the higher energy prices that prevailed before Katrina might have a bigger im pact on consumer spendi ng and overall growth, particularly if the supply shock of the hurricane doesn’t ease off as expected.  Pre-Katrina shipments and orders data may foretell a flattening rather than a rebound of capital spending.  On the other hand, greater fiscal ease will certainly be an additional stimulant, and the hurricane could provide additional cover for more widespread pricing power. Productivity growth has slowe d, and we hear reports of labor being hard to find.  Combine these reports with the slowly falling unemployment rate, and a surge in wage and salary growth as measured by the ECI, which we haven’t seen yet, may not be far off the mark. As a matter of risk management, it seems to me  for now that appearing to be complacent about simultaneous energy demand and supply sh ocks and diminishing excess capacity might well be more costly in terms of expectations and central bank credibil ity than dealing with         60 of 117greater downside effects if they were to emerge .  Those effects could be addressed in a timely way by pausing, but at this point I do n’t see a need to take that step. Thus, I’m in favor of continuing our process of removing policy accommodation at this meeting.  Incoming economic data could well convi nce us of the need to stay put some time soon, or we might find it necessary to continue our upward trek longer or at a faster pace than we now are expecting. But at this point, con tinuing to remove policy accommodation at the “measured pace” we’ve been doing seems about right.

MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Fifth District economic activity appears to have expanded at a quicker pace from mid-Augus t through mid-September.  For the most part, production and sales in our area we re not substantially affected by Hurricane Katrina.  Shipments from District factories accelerated from August’s modest upturn, and new orders grew for the first time since May.  Service firms reported faster  growth in their revenues, and they maintained the moderate pace of hiring seen in early August.   Retailers told us th at overall sales grew modestly. Labor market conditions remained solid, with District job growth maintaining the moderate pace of recent months. Hurricane Katrina had relatively few real eff ects in our area, as I said, causing only some scattered and short-lived outages of gasoline and interrupting raw materials shipments to a small number of manufacturing firms.  In addition, higher gasoline prices, combined with fears of availability, seemed to curta il tourist activity over the Labor Day weekend.  Another hurricane,         61 of 117Ophelia, battered the Carolina coast last week, but preliminary assessments suggest it was not any more damaging than the typical, run-of-the-mill hurricane.  While several of our contacts tell us that highe r fuel costs will squeeze profit margins, the majority tell us that they are passing on cost incr eases to their customers.  Many firms report that customers are more receptive to price hikes in th e current environment.  With about half the responses in as of yesterday morning, prelimin ary results from our September business surveys are showing that both prices paid  and prices received are rising at a quicker pace than in August, and expected price trends have generally ratcheted up as well.  Turning to the national picture, the Gr eenbook’s forecasts for output and its components appear broadly consistent with private forecasters and with what we were hearing from our Fifth District contacts. Prior to Ka trina, the economy was growing at  a reasonably strong pace but with some signs of inflation pressures rising from elevated oil prices.  And the real effects of the hurricane that are projected in the Greenbook forecast appear quite plausible, given the difficulties of assessing the temporal extent  of the disruptions to economic activity. But on the inflation side, the Greenbook forecas t paints a picture that I find somewhat distressing. The staff’s inflati on forecast has been steadily dr ifting up over time—as shown, for example, in the fine new table on page 21.  [La ughter]  And it was revised up markedly for this meeting.  Core PCE inflation is near 2½ percent throughout 2006 and does not fall below 2 percent until 2007. Inflation expectations move  upward as well, which causes growth in compensation and unit labor costs to  step up significantly at the beginning of next year.  This would put inflation appreciably beyond a range I view as cons istent with price stability.         62 of 117While the real, quantitative effects of the hurricane are unc ertain at this time and may prove more moderate than first feared, the qualita tive implications for short-term real rates seem quite clear to me.  A real interest rate is, of course, the price of current  resources relative to forgone future resources, and for a number of reas ons Katrina has caused a temporary scarcity of current resources. A portion of the capital stock in the affected  region has been destroyed or damaged, and workers have been separated from em ployers.  It will inevitably take time and resources to rebuild the capital stock and r eestablish productive labor market matches. The good news is that these effects are likely to be relatively short-lived.  Within a year or so, we are likely to be back to more or less where we would have been in the aggregate.  But this means that, if anything, Katrina should cause  real interest rates to rise to encourage adjustment to the temporary scarcity of current resources.  The fiscal response to the disaster points in the same direction rega rding real rates.  The sustaina bility of federal deficits was questionable prior to Hurricane Katrina, and the spending amounts being proposed for hurricane recovery efforts just strengthe n the case for tighter policy. I think we have to be careful about reasoning on the basis of the gap between current output and estimates of potential output.  Some estimates appear to identify the decline in potential primarily with a small estimated effect of lost capital.  Such approaches see the supply-side effects of Katrina as minimal and, therefore,  interpret most of the decline in output as a shock to aggregate demand. This makes it tempting to a naive policymaker to consider counteracting the macroeconomic effects with easier policy.  But all of the real resource effects of Katrina of         63 of 117which I’m aware amount to reductions in our cu rrent capacity to produce goods and services.  Lower real interest rates can do li ttle to counteract these reductions. I think we should be careful about the widely cited analogy in th e public press to the 1970s when oil supply shocks were subsequently  followed by recessions.  I say this recognizing that several participants around the table were somewhat closer to monetary policy than I was then. But in the 1970s, inflation expectations we re untethered, and people came to expect us to allow energy price shocks to feed through to overall inflation.  We often confirmed that expectation by keeping real interest  rates from rising.  In fact, at  times, we kept nominal rates from rising as fast as inflation and, thus, real rates fell.  We were then forced to raise rates dramatically to bring inflation back down and, in  the process, exacerbated the real effects of the oil price shocks. So, to interpret the effects of Katrina as signaling an imminent s hortfall of aggregate demand is to draw the wrong lesson from the 1970s, in my view.  The right lesson for us today is the importance of keeping inflation expectations anchored in the f ace of this shock.  At our last meeting, we noted the relative stability of longer- term inflation expectations as measured by the TIPS inflation compensation numbers, even in the face of sustained oil price increases.  But the behavior of the fed funds futures prices and th e TIPS curve since Hurricane Katrina suggest to me that our credibility is seriously incomplete, in the sense that many market participants appear to think that we might be willing to tolerate elevat ed inflation for some time in an attempt to ease the real effects of the hurricane .  Our action and statement today should provide the public with greater certainty about our n ear-term intentions.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Stern.         64 of 117MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start with a few pertinent facts about the District economy, both pre- a nd post-Katrina.  Overall, the Di strict economy remains healthy.  Employment is continuing to advance modestly; a nd in at least a few geographic areas, it seems likely that employment gains are being constrai ned by a lack of availa ble labor.  Construction activity, both residential and nonresidential, is strong and/or improving.  And one of the large credit card issuers in our Di strict has reported—and I think th is is reflective of national conditions—that repayments on credit card debt ar e up and charge-offs are at a 10-year low.   Higher fuel prices so far ha ve not led to production cutback s or plant closings in the District. Where possible, firms are switching to less expensive sources of energy, and surcharges are, of course, common. Higher energy prices do , though, seem to be particularly adverse for local governments and for farmers, who are also adversely affected by the infrastructure destruction and disrupti on in the Gulf area. As for the effects of Katrina on the national economy, at the qualitati ve level I think we actually have considerable experience in analyzing these kinds of shocks, and in my view the Greenbook at that level has it essentially right.  It seems to me, as  others have commented, that in the short term we will ge t a disruption to growth followed by a rebound and presumably ultimately a resumption of trend growth.  And, as fa r as inflation is concerned, I think we will get an acceleration ultimately followed by a return to  trend, assuming that policy adheres more or less to the path that it would have followed. At the quantitative le vel, though, it seems to me difficult to say a nything precise with a lot of confidence. But I would venture that in these circumstances—because of the concentration of the population, the number of pe ople affected by the disaster, a nd the affected area’s location        65 of 117relative to the energy and transportation infrastr ucture—the amplitude of the swings, both in terms of growth and inflation, and perhaps the duration of the adjustment, would be extended.  There’s a temptation, I suppose, to exaggerate this.  After all, a relatively small part of the economy is affected.  But it seems to me that, in any event, uncer tainty has increased.  And if this overall description is r oughly appropriate, then I find thi nking about monetary policy more complicated than it was formerly.  Moreover, I don’t think the situation is  going to get clarified in the near term, because the incoming data, of c ourse, will be difficult to read, given that they will be affected in one way or another by both the disruption and the recovery efforts as they proceed. In these circumstances, I feel most comf ortable falling back on fundamentals—namely, the flexibility and strength of the underlying economy, which I don’ t think are affected by this.  So I come out with a view that it’s appropria te to continue on our path of removing policy accommodation, and I would favor a ¼ point increase in the fed funds rate.  Having said that, I think we are getting to the point where we’ve removed a lot of accommodation.  And one of these days we need to consider that and also think a bout how that ought to affect the language in the statement. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Th ere has been a lot of discussion on the national economy and Katrina, and I don’t think I’ll repeat that.  But I would say that I am in agreement with the scenario the Greenbook ha s outlined here; we do expect a temporary slowdown in the economy this year and then a pickup next year and beyond.  And I think the evidence from our region is c onsistent with that outlook.        66 of 117Economic growth in the District remain s strong, although businesses have expressed some concern over the impact of Katrina on the regional economy.  At the end of August, though, employment was still growing solidly.  Retailer s reported further growth in sales; tourist activity continued to show little effect from higher gasoline prices at that time; and manufacturing activity had grown pretty solidly over the summer. In a special survey that we conducted followi ng Katrina, a wide range of contacts said that the disaster would have so me negative effect on their busine sses in terms of costs and the availability of supplies.  And a small percentage  actually expected some positive effects from it. More specifically, a contact at a major railroad coming out of our Di strict from Kansas City told me that they were able to get their operations along the Gulf Coast back in order within just a few days of Katrina and were back moving materi als across that area at almost normal levels.  So, there has been a fairly strong reaction in terms of br inging things back on line after Katrina. While the impacts of Katrina remain uncertai n, I would say that an alysts in the farm sector are more optimistic than they were just  a week ago, for example.  The impact on the transportation system, as I just mentioned, appears to be less than initially feared.  Terminal facilities are now reporting limited damage to physical infrastructure, and the unloading of barges and loading of ocean-going vessels appe ar to be starting again.  As a result, the hurricane’s impact on agriculture will be primarily  through higher fuel prices.  Higher diesel and natural gas prices have a large impact on crop production costs, as th ey boost the cost of operating machinery, drying grain, fe rtilizers, and so forth.  So ove rall I think activity in our District will continue strong. Ka trina will have some impact on the region but not a major or long-lasting one for the most part.          67 of 117Turning to the inflation outlook, my concer ns there have not changed since our last meeting.  Core inflation is higher than I would prefer, although it still is in the 2 percent plus range. Core CPI inflation, for example, is up 2.2 percent in August from a year ago, and other measures of underlying CPI inflation are, in fa ct, higher and moving slowly up.  In addition, I believe the upside risks to inflation have increased, and I think we need to  be aware of that and sensitive to it. In my view, a pause now would in fact be more than a pause, because as others said—in particular President Santomero—in this environmen t the data are going to come in weaker than we would otherwise expect.  So a pause now would be hard to reverse until sometime next year. The other point, which others also have noted, is that fundamentally monetary policy remains accommodative for now.  We have been re moving accommodation but policy is still accommodative, and I think we need to keep that in mind.  Therefore, I think we should continue on that path as we move forward from this poi nt.  I would agree, though, since we have been removing accommodation for a while, that at some point here in the next few meetings we should be talking about changing the language an d about how close we are to neutral on the funds rate. I think that will be an important and interesting discussion for us.  However, for the time being, I think we should stay on our course  and remove accommodation at the pace we have been doing in recent months.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Poole. MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to focus on a couple of anecdotal reports on the weak side of the projections going forward.  But I don’t want this to be misunderstood; the general tenor of reports I’ve heard is clearly on the positive side.         68 of 117I do want to say also that we seem to have  merged the first and second go-rounds, so I’ll just take note of that. [Laughter] I’m  not going to break that pattern either. According to my contact at Wal-Mart, th e company estimates that every $10 per barrel increase in crude oil costs them about 100 basis po ints of same-store growth.  In fact, Wal-Mart is cutting back purchases for the holiday season.  Wal-Mart suppliers ar e also concerned about the strength of holiday sales, and Wal-Mart is in the pr ocess of negotiating price concessions in anticipation of weak sales.  I th ink that more or less fits the me ssage from my colleague to the right. Wal-Mart is anticipating a significant e ffect on corporate profits from the hurricane, both because of the damage and also because of the voluntary contributions that many companies have made. I have a contact in a large software company who said that they ar e very concerned about weakness in the large enterprise sector of that business on a gl obal basis.  They don’t understand exactly what’s happening there, but they beli eve large enterprises may be making a genuine effort by to cut back on spending, perhaps becaus e of the cycle that companies went through.  They had delayed purchases and a lot of them have come back.  But now they have filled their needs and are slowing down. My UPS contact said that they’re looking at an unexplaine d shortfall in the last two months in volume and revenue projections coming out of Asia.  They don’t know why that is happening. One other thing that’s going on with UPS and FedEx both is that they’re in the midst of labor negotiations that are beginning to become  nasty, with pilots disrupting service.  An example cited was this: A pilot lands a plane, knows that something needs to be fixed, but forgets to notify anyone until shortly before the plan e is scheduled to take off.  That then causes         69 of 117a delay. So there are some so-ca lled job actions by some very strong- willed pilots.  I think this is true for both UPS and FedEx, and it could lead  to some disruption during the peak season. As I hear people around the table—and I think we’ll hear the same from those who have not yet spoken—we’re all very adamant that the fundamental course of policy going forward not depart from controlling inflation.  So, looking out over the next year , Katrina will have an effect primarily through the energy sector, because the dire ct disruption is a pretty small part of the total economy. What we have is a supply disturbance in energy overlaid on a fundamentally strong demand picture that has been driving up energy prices worldwide, and I don’t think we know exactly how big that disruption is going to be from  the supply side.  And it’ s not just gasoline; I think heating costs for fuel oil and natural gas will be a bigger bind for consumers.  Once we start paying winter heating bills, the discussions about sales bei ng hurt by high gasoline prices are going to be displaced s ubstantially by discussions about the cost of heating. I would like to state my own view in favor of  a pause.  At least I think we ought to get that case on the table. I want to reemphasize that we need to re tain our longer-run concern about inflation. I think we can be completely clear ab out that in our statement.  The statement would say something along the lines that as the uncerta inties are resolved, we would then anticipate resuming the “measured pace” of rate increases. But I would also like to address the policy question by focusing on how best to deal with a number of possible outcomes.  To some extent we tend to focus on the forecast in terms of a point estimate, and I think th e Greenbook does a good job with that .  But there are substantial uncertainties about the forecast—probably even greater uncertainties in the near term than       70 of 117looking out a year because it’s a question of how fast the rec onstruction takes place.  Huge federal involvement may actually slow things down in the near term, because people will be waiting to see the money and may delay spending to rebuild and replace.  I don’t really know. But I’d like to focus attention on the following:  Suppose, on the one hand, we have a good news scenario where things fall into  place better than we might ha ve anticipated and, on the other hand, a bad news scenario where things are wors e than we might have anticipated.  How would today’s policy decision position us best for dealing with those va rious possibilities? Clearly, if we raised rates today, it would fit nicely with the good news scenario.  And we would continue removing policy accommodation w ith however many more moves are needed in the future. If we have a bad news  scenario and we paused today, th at also would fit well.  On the other hand, if we raised the funds rate today and have a bad news scenario, we might find ourselves in a position where we would feel compe lled to pause later.  Then we would be in a situation where people would quest ion why we didn’t pause right af ter the hurricane when all the uncertainties were in place.  If we paused now, we would have made the correct call, if you will.  And as the uncertainties are resolved, we would th en go back to raising rates.  So, it’s that kind of calculation that leads me to co me out in favor of a pause.  I think with the proper wording of our statement we will be able to resume our rate increases in a timely fashion.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Pianalto. MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The contours of the economic effects of Hurricane Katrina that are laid ou t in the Greenbook baseline look about right to me.  But in the aftermath of the hurricane, and with the fragility  in the energy markets, I found myself focusing more on the alternative s cenarios in the Greenbook.  In the c onversations that I’ve had with my       71 of 117business contacts, they appear to have more anxiety about future prospect s than about the present circumstances.  My business contacts who have retail stores, warehouses, and production facilities in the Gulf region all seem to have a good handle on the direct impacts of the storm, and for the most part they say that their losse s are manageable.  But they emphasize that the indirect effects of the storm, driven primarily  by increases in costs of energy and building materials prices, will be difficu lt to discern for many months.   Of particular concern to many of my directors is the reacti on of consumers to the expense of filling their gas tanks and heat ing their homes during the winter.  My directors report that they are already witnessing some retrenchment in consumer spending, and they don’t know how much of this is just a temporary reaction or how much of it is a preview of more adjustments to come.   The preliminary release of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey illustrates this concern, and I think the Greenboo k’s “sentiment slump” alternative scenario addresses the policy issues that su ch a development would entail.   The latest spike in energy prices triggered by Katrina also has implications for the inflation outlook. On the positive side, most reports that I have been getting still have the flavor of businesses unable to pass on higher costs to their customers. Nevertheless, the headline and core inflation reports are likely to look scary for the next several months.  Fortunately, as several of my contacts have explained, more than the usua l number of price increases are taking the form of surcharges that are expected to be rem oved when energy and other raw materials prices recede. To the extent that this practice lies behi nd some of the near-term bad news that we are seeing on the inflation front, there is still reason to think that the Greenbook baseline projection will prove to be accurate.  But at the same time, the “deteriorating inflation expectations”         72 of 117scenario highlights a risk to the outlook that also troubles me a grea t deal.  I’m very pleased that we’ve enjoyed the public’s confidence regardin g our commitment to containing long-term inflation expectations for as l ong as we have during the successi ve energy price increases that we’ve been hit with, but I’m not anxious to test the limits of that confidence. Even if the odds of the sentiment slump a nd the deteriorating inflation expectations scenarios are similar, the polic y implications are not.  The Greenbook projects a GDP difference in those two scenarios that is very small, but the difference in the projected inflation outcomes is too sizable for me to ignore.  Consequently, I thi nk the more prudent course of action today is for us to continue to remove our polic y accommodation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The balance of evidence since our last meeting still supports, in our view, a reasonably positive outlook for output and inflation. If we look through, as we should, the transitory effect s of Katrina and the reconstruction, and if we factor in what the futu res market tells us about the expected magnitude and duration of the rise in energy prices, we st ill see an economy growing slightly above trend with core inflation following a path somewhat, but  not substantially, abov e our preferred range.  The fundamentals still seem favorable to co ntinued expansion with solid productivity growth, strong corporate balance sheets, reasona ble growth in household income, and favorable financial conditions. And on the stre ngth of this view, with  real interest rates still quite low, we believe that we need to continue to tighten m onetary policy at this meeting and beyond.  At the national level, Katrina seems more cons equential politically than economically.        73 of 117Now, of course, the degree and balance of uncertainty has changed.  We face a higher degree of overall uncertainty. It will be harder to assess over the next few quarters the underlying pace of demand growth.  The rise of  energy prices pre-Katrina—some of which remains even as the initial effects of the hurri cane on expectations have washed out of energy than seems to have been evident over the last two years.  Damage from future hurricanes to energy and product output may prove harder to bridge through the rel ease of international product reserves. Our capacity to  discern the underlyi ng rate of inflation is also somewhat diminished, perhaps less because of the effect of energy prices than the difficulty of sorting out what is actually happening to produc tivity growth and unit labor costs. Apart from reducing overall confidence around the forecasts, the balance of risks has probably shifted, too—shifted toward  a somewhat higher probability of slower grow th relative to the path of potential output and to ward a greater risk of a larger a nd more persistent rise in core inflation. If the former risk materialized, the la tter might be mitigated.  These are risks across the spectrum of scenarios, rather than  the most probable combination. But to acknowledge the change in uncerta inty is not to suggest that it would be appropriate for us to stop or to push down the e xpected path of the nomin al fed funds rate until we can better assess what we do not know now. The net effect of the changes to the outlook, on balance, probably does not alter the desirable path of the nominal fed funds rate relative to what we thought in mid-August.  With the real rate still rather low, my inclination would be to continue to weight the upside risk  to inflation as greater than the prospective risk of a significant slowdown in output relative to poten tial.  As best we can tell t oday, that latter ri sk of weaker         74 of 117growth is still only prospective. This implies that the slope of th e expected fed funds rate should remain materially positive, even if we move today.  And I think we would be better off after this meeting if the markets raised the expected path a bit than if the path were to fall from its pre-meeting trajectory.  I think we probably know a little less today than we did in August about how far we are going to have to move, even if the economy appears to be following the path of our forecast.  If we move today, all we know is that we’re 25 basis points higher than we were.  The fact that we are that much closer to some point we can’t measure is a le ss valuable observation.  We may even know less today about where equilibrium lies and whether that range has moved.  And, of course, we still face some probability that we’ll have  to move past it, or past what in retrospect we thought was equilibrium. Most of the hard questions we face look pret ty much like they did at the last meeting.  How strong and durable can we e xpect the expansion to be in the face of less optimism about future housing price gains or other factors th at could cause househol d saving to rise and consumption to grow more slowly?  Will this dr amatic rise in energy prices over the past two years cause more substantial damage to business and consumer confidence?  Will the world’s private savers continue to be w illing to acquire claims on the Un ited States at the higher rate implied by our current account forecast, and to do  so on such favorable terms?  Will business Will the U.S. political system be able to make a credible effort in the near term to improve our medium-term fiscal position and sustain our relati vely open trade policy?  And, if not, do we risk a reduction in expected potential growth in the future?      75 of 117These are all factors that could hurt future gr owth, but that doesn’t mean that monetary policy should be more accommodative than would ot herwise make sense in anticipation of those negative effects or should try to preempt them.  Rather, these familiar imbalances and concerns make the cost of any erosion in our credibility greater.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like President Geithner and many others of you, I do view this as one of those rare situations in which we can  truly say the outlook is more uncertain than usual.  [Laughter] But that should not deter us from proceeding with our “measured pace” of rate increases. The pre-Katrina data themselves suggested so me potentially interesting questions about the outlook, which could have implications for po licy going forward.  I wa s especially struck by the weakness in capital spending, despite high and ri sing profits and strength  in other aspects of the so-called fundamentals.  It’s possible that business caution has increased again, perhaps out of concern about the effects of the rapid run- up in energy prices on de mand since last spring. But at the same time, house prices on the OFHEO index continued to rise at a very rapid pace through the second quarter, supporting household spending and furt her increases in resource utilization. The expansion was continuing but had become even more unbalanced—more reliant on declining household saving rates induced by ri sing house prices.  Core inflation was coming in lower than expected again. But the potential  for future price increases, absent a further tightening of policy, was suggested by upside surprises on one measure of labor costs, rising resource utilization, and the thr eat that increases in  energy costs could feed through to underlying inflation.       76 of 117I agree with the staff’s assessment that the mo st likely outcome from Katrina is that the economy will not be materially deflected from the path it was on.  After the initial disruptions, fiscal stimulus, rising house prices, and stil l favorable financial conditions, along with the economy’s natural resilience, should overcome a ny drag from higher energy prices and should keep activity increasing at a good clip in an economy  that is already produc ing at a high level of resource utilization. Under these circumstances, inflation pressu res will not abate.  And judging from the tendency for the output gap to continue to shrink this year, we’ll probably need at least a couple of rounds of rate increases to keep the economy near its potential and to prevent inflation from trending higher. Katrina has greatly added to unc ertainty, and not just about the extent of the near-term disruption or the effects on energy market s.  The more difficult uncertainties relate to how people may react to what has happened, how  the government will decide to respond, and how businesses and households will react to these governmental acti ons and to whatever the path of energy prices turns out to be. How these uncertainties are resolved will a ffect the economy’s medium-term prospects. But at this point, that added uncertainty doesn’t look particularly asymmetri cal in its implications for the path of policy. The risk s are still two-sided.  Growth c ould be stronger than anticipated, for example, owing to greater government spending and new tax incentives, with implications for inflation. But on the other si de, the rise in energy prices may have less of a persistent effect on core inflation than the staff has predicted. The feed-through of energy prices to core in flation has declined appreciably over time, and market participants who have  actually marked down longer-ter m nominal interest rates since      77 of 117August may have it right that higher energy prices will have more of a negative influence on demand than a positive effect on long-term inflati on.  The skews in the probabilities for the most likely outcomes were highlighted by the Michigan survey on Frid ay, pointing to extra weight on the possibility of weaker growth from increasin g energy prices that affect consumer psychology and spending but also pointing to potentially higher inflation if expectations do become unanchored. And these skews themselves ha ve offsetting implic ations for policy. Moreover, uncertainty isn’t going to be re duced by pausing or slowing the pace of tightening. This uncertainty isn’ t about the response of  the economy to past or future monetary policy actions. Raising the funds rate, as e xpected, isn’t likely to undermine sentiment or spending. Indeed, pausing, slowing down, or bei ng more ambiguous about our expectations for policy going forward could confuse the pub lic about our view of the situation. In sum, this is a situation in which we s hould make our best guesses as to the likely outcome, however bad those guesses may be, and act on them, continuing the “measured pace” of tightening for now. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson. MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Beyond the tragic and sobering consequences of Katrina that we saw, the effect  of Katrina with respect to monetary policy I think has been to create greater unc ertainty, not just about  the near term but also the intermediate term.  Katrina clearly has become more policy-rele vant than the previous natural disasters that we’ve seen, because it hit energy-producing re gions of the country at a time of high and potentially rising energy prices driven by global supply and demand factors.  It also came at a time when resource utilization was clearly tighten ing and the output gap wa s closing because the      78 of 117economy—supported by a particularly strong housing market and accommodative monetary policy—appeared to be gr owing above potential,  Additionally, core measures of inflation, while not deteriorating recently, had been running a bit high for my taste.  Near-term inflation expectations were also rising; and longer-term expectations, while still being described as contained, were somewhat less contained than they had been at the last m eeting, as Dino’s chart showed. I think the staff has done an outstanding job of calibrating th e effects of Katrina and the subsequent rebuilding on the ec onomy, including a careful assessmen t of the loss of and need to rebuild the capital stock.  I accept the baseline fo recast as the basis for discussion today and note that its contours are similar to those of private se ctor forecasters as well. However, the range of uncertainty around the baseline forecast is large.  The plunge of consumer sentiment reminds us of that fact, as do the rise in inflation expecta tions in the most recent survey data and the ongoing jitters in spot and futures energy markets. Faced with such uncertainty, we might be guided by our history in dealing with other periods of shock to the economic system.  Duri ng previous episodes of shock and uncertainty, we have often lowered rates or at least temporar ily refrained from raising rates to wait for the range of uncertainty to narrow. Therefore, befo re deciding to raise rate s today, we have a burden of examining why we are not following the sa me reaction function we have in the past. I see at least four reasons w hy, unlike in the past 20 years or  so, the uncertainty that we face now should not be a precursor to a pause.  Firs t, the relative impact of a natural disaster on growth and inflation is ambiguous and not easily  comparable to the shocks that we have experienced in the last two decades.  Important ly, those shocks—9/11, the stock market break of        79 of 1171987, and even Y2K—were clearly, or at least primarily, demand shocks, working through confidence effects and unsettled fi nancial conditions, either actual or potential.  Now, as others have said or implied, we are facing a shock to both the demand and the supply side of the economy.  This is obviously an important distinc tion.  Katrina is likely to  elongate the period of high and rising energy prices that  we were already confronting before the hurricane struck. In the longer run, theory tells us that a persistently high energy cost, exacerbated by occasional shocks, reduces both labor productivity and potential output over time, as the amount of energy used per worker declin es.  This effect is only partia lly offset by the installation of energy-saving devices. If households and firms recognize the impact of high energy prices on potential supply, all else equal, they should lower equity prices and also damp aggregate demand through expectational effects. The possible reduction in aggr egate demand does not, however, ipso facto match fully the reduction in potential supply.  President Lacker suggested that a naive policymaker might put greater weight on the dema nd effects, but I also think that a reasonable policymaker would certainly recognize the need to set policy to help maintain a balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand. And that does not inherently impl y reducing our target funds rate. Second, as already indicated, before Katrina we were se eing conditions of gradually rising inflation pressures.  Staff estimates that seem reasonable to me indicate that the persistent energy price increases have contributed and will contribute ¼ to ¾ percentage points annually to core inflation between 2004 and 2007.  Importantl y, the staff forecast for inflation has been gradually rising from Greenbook to  Greenbook as well.  If we we re to pause today, in my judgment we clearly would risk  allowing the pass-through from headline inflation to core       80 of 117inflation to become embedded in inflation expectations, making it di fficult to regain control over the inflation process and losing so me of our hard-won credibility. Third, the effort to rebuild parts of the United States wi ll undoubtedly require massive federal expenditures in addition to  transfers from insurers to hous eholds and businesses.  As the staff forecast shows, this will be highly stimulative to the economy next year.  I won’t elaborate on that, as a number of others  have already discussed it. And I think the final reason for not following a pause strategy here, as a few others have said, is that it won’t be clear when  we can restart again.  It is not clear to me at all that the data over the next few quarters will be free from the disruption of Katrina, but it is pretty clear to me that inflation pressures will continue to build.  So, therefore, the staff forecast strikes me as a reasonable approach.  That forecast manages to  allow these various effects on growth—actual and potential—and inflation to end with a stable inflation outlook, in part by assuming that this Committee raises rates from the current accommoda tive level.  This assumption seems warranted to me.  In my judgment, we have sufficient reason not to follow our historical response of pausing. The one counterargument to all of this is th at there are also clear ly a number of drags on the U.S. economy.  These drags include drags from  the export sector and re latively slow growth of business fixed investment.  These show thro ugh, in my judgment, in the form of a lower equilibrium real interest rate, which implies that at some point we certainly should discuss when we want to stop raising the funds ra te or at least be clear that we’v e moved past the neutral level.  That may be, as I think Tom Hoenig suggested, in  the not-too-distant future.  Be that as it may, I’d say for today that we should continue to tighten. Thank you.     81 of 117CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Dave Stockton’s introduction today suggested that this Greenbook analysis was a combination of the use of judgment and models.  And as I reviewed the input, I noted it reflects that combination. To wit, the Greenbook said that Katrina will restrain economic activity for the remainder of the year. Information is scant and fractured. We are in uncharted territory, with devastation of an entire city. Katrina is expected to depr ess real GDP by about ¾ pe rcentage point in the third quarter, half of the effect due to reduced energy sector output .  In the fourth quarter, a small positive real GDP growth is expected, but consumption will remain depressed.  By the end of 2007, the level of GDP is expected to be back wher e it would have been prior to the hurricane.  Not included in the Greenbook, but a judgment that seem s obvious at this point, is that there is an immeasurable but hard to ignore fact that the economy is only now recovering from a corporate wariness toward expansion, sugges ting that the psychological impact of Katrina is potentially problematic. Turning to the inflation outlook, consumer energy prices are expected to increase considerably in the third and fourth quarters and then fall back in subsequent years.  Our current projection for the pass-through effect  contributes 0.2 to core PCE pr ices in 2006, with little effect in 2007. The fiscal stimulus expected to follow Katrina will impact the economy primarily in the years 2006 and 2007. I would say that, as time passes, hopefully the need for an appropriate congressional response to Katrina will be balanced  by the need for fiscal discipline, as suggested by several of you.       82 of 117With respect to the monetary policy path, the September Greenbook was unchanged from the August Greenbook; the expectation is for a 4 percent fed funds targ et by year-end and a 4¼ percent rate by mid-2006.  In one of the alternative scenario s in the Greenbook—characterized by deteriorating inflation expectations created largely by surging energy costs—core PCE will not stabilize at 2 percent by 2007 but  instead rise to 2½ percent in that year.  A Taylor rule construct of monetary policy response would brin g the fed funds target at that point to 4¾ percent. In summary, the economy has taken a body blow as  a result of Katrina.  The solid growth that we had been experiencing has been interrupt ed, but the economy is expected to get back on track during 2006. The speed of the recovery is unknowable at this point, as the devastation to New Orleans has put us in uncharted territory, as we said earlier.  It is important, as many of you have pointed out, to note that the pass-through e ffects of higher energy costs require that we maintain and perhaps increase our sensitivity to in flationary pressures.  The effects of Katrina and the concerns about the potenti al for Hurricane Rita, as amplified by yesterday’s movement in the WTI spot price, suggest that we not take this  week’s measure of inflat ionary expectations or headline inflation as an indication of how core inflation may be impacted in future months. Ten consecutive ¼ point increases have brought the target fed funds rate into a range where it can reach both the expected  level for year-end as well as that for the middle of next year without a need to continue our unbroken p ace of rate increases.  And a pause would accommodate the alternative scenario of deteriorating inflationary expectations.  As it will be weeks, perhaps months, before we can fully asse ss the economic implications of the devastation        83 of 117caused by Katrina, I think it may be appropriate  to pause or defer removing accommodation at this meeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As many of you have already remarked, preparing for this meeting was a lot more challe nging than preparing for other recent meetings.  The economy was poised for strong growth in the third and fourth quarters before Hurricane Katrina. And the forecast that the staff has developed in the Greenbook I think is reasonable, given what we know at this time.  That forecas t suggests that while we may see some short-run softness, with growth below the rate we had anticipated, the rebuilding efforts clearly will add stimulus over the next year.  I am also comfor ted that the underlying economy was strong.  So while we are going to see a slight downtick due to the impact of the hurricane, the Greenbook forecast of real GDP growth in the mid-3 percent range over the next year indicates that we have sound economic expansion ahead.  So while uncerta inty about economic growth has increased, I still believe there are much more se rious clouds on the inflation horizon. The rapid rise in energy prices  in the last couple of months has pushed the level of prices high enough that more firms are likely to find th at they cannot absorb the increased costs and must raise prices to protect their profit margins.  This will become more so the longer that energy prices remain high. I am still hearing mixed expectations about th e availability of natu ral gas this winter.  While the impact of Katrina may not be as severe  as first feared, the limited ability to expand natural gas supply, as we saw in th e last two years, on top of slower fill due to hurricane damage,       84 of 117As the Greenbook notes, business spending on equipment and software has only modest forward momentum.  This is despite solid eco nomic growth, healthy profits, and favorable financial conditions. So why is business investme nt so limited?  I’m going to answer this by referring to the most recent quarterly survey of CFOs conducted by Duke University with CFO Magazine. And I would note that this survey was concluded on August 28, the day before Katrina hit. I want to read to you the lead on their press release for this survey.  It says: “Corporate Optimism Plummets in Response to Housing and Fuel  Concerns.”  For the first time in the four-year history of this survey, more CFOs are pe ssimistic than optimistic about the U.S. economy.  Their number one concern is high fuel costs, rank ing above health care costs for the first time.  Interestingly, the survey also noted a jump in wh at they call their terror ism index, with one-third of the firms responding that co sts to improve security and business recovery response has negatively impacted their bottom line.  I think afte r Katrina there will be more firms looking at their business recovery plans. As some executives have told me, with the rising costs of benefits , energy, and financing, they are closely managing discretionary items, including capital spending.  Over the next 12 months, the CFOs who participated in the survey are planning slower growth of investment; they now expect to increase capital spending by only 4.7 percent.  The survey indicates that CFOs are also worried about the housing market.  They believe the market is overheated and that a necessary and expected decline in housing prices will negatively affect their firms.  This echoes comments I’ve heard from others that a revers al in the housing market might have negative spillover effects due to consumers’ reactions to a fall in the value of their housing wealth.  So I        85 of 117find the survey results consistent with other comments I’ve been hearing that the business pessimism we’re seeing is due in large part to growing concerns about ri sing prices on several fronts. While recent inflation numbers are very well behaved, the Greenbook does reflect a rise in the core inflation forecast over the next year .  The volatility we saw yesterday in the energy futures market, clearly due to Rita and other concerns, indicates how much the market is focusing on the unknown path for inflation that companies are facing.  While the impact on inflation may be unclear—and we know the damage to platforms out in the Gulf and the effects on refinery capacity are still be ing assessed—the nervousness about  costs is a factor that is affecting business behavior, and it is something that we can’t ignor e.  The fiscal stimulus of Katrina and the rebuilding that will result is only going to add to inflation—and that’s on top of a transportation bill that has a lot of spending on infrastructure that some of us think should have less priority than rebuild ing around the Gulf Coast. The chart on page 21—and I also love these new charts—helps us keep things in perspective, in terms of the hi storical trends in inflation as we’ve been tightening up from meeting to meeting.  And we have to keep that in mind as we look to the future.  We know that there is still ample liquidity in financial markets,  so the risks of higher inflation to me right now are much greater than the risks to economic growth. I think it’s important that at  today’s meeting we give the market assurance that we will continue to focus on and be dilige nt in dealing with inflation, becau se rising costs appear to be at the heart of companies’ concerns.  To me that’s very important, and I want to support an increase in interest rates at this meeting.                                                              86 of 117CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Mr. Reinhart. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I w ill be referring to the material that Carol Low is now passing around.  And out of deference to Governor Bernanke, I’m going to start reading before everybody has a copy of the material. As Dave explained, there is a lot goi ng on underneath the newly revised green sheets, as the effects of higher energy pri ces and the disruption of Hurricane Katrina shift the timing and composition of GDP grow th over the next few quarters.  As is unfortunately familiar, such a supply shoc k confronts central bankers with unpleasant choices, as you have to weigh the benefit of a potential policy offset to near-term  softness in spending against the cost of a dding impetus to inflation.  By my reading, however, investors do not share your pain. As  can be seen in the top left panel of your first exhibit, market part icipants apparently interprete d the confluence of events over the past six weeks as reason to mark down the anticipated path of the funds rate as much as 30 basis points.  While you are expected to tighten today, the market is betting, on net, that only one more action will mark the conclusion of the measured removal of policy accommodation. This reduction in expected policy rest raint was associated with inflation compensation moving higher (as shown in the top right panel) and longer-term  nominal yields dropping more considerably (as shown by the 10-year yield plotted at the lower left). The fact that equity prices posted an increase on balance and corporate risk spreads remained thin would s eem to suggest that i nvestors believe that the anticipated path of monetary policy, t ogether with fiscal policy stimulus, will be sufficient to cushion the adverse effects of Hurricane Katrina on aggregate income  and production, albeit with you accep ting a little more inflation. The staff’s assessment, summarized in exhi bit 2, differs somewhat.  In light of the effects of the hurricane and other news  over the intermeeting period, the staff trimmed its forecast of real GDP growth in th e second half of this year (plotted in the upper left panel) but boosted it in the firs t half of 2006 as dest ruction gives way to reconstruction. The outlook for core PCE infl ation, given in the second column of the table in the upper right panel,  is a touch lower this year  than was anticipated in higher energy costs are passed through into core prices. The bottom four panels offer one perspective on the policy choice confronting you today—an optimal control exercise, usi ng the version of FRB/US with investors who are assumed to foresee policy outcomes correctly.  The blue solid lines in the four panels plot the path s of key macro variables under the Greenbook outlook, given a policy trajectory chosen to minimize a loss function that weights equally 2 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).           87 of 117unemployment and inflation gaps and that al so puts a small penalty on interest rate volatility. The red dotted lin es report the same exercise, excluding the estimated effects of Katrina on confidence, energy prices, and overall inflation that are embedded in the baseline forecast.  As can be seen, the simulations produce nearly identical paths for the nominal federal funds rate (the middle left panel).  Essentially, the Katrina effects temporarily boosting infl ation (the bottom right) lower the real federal funds rate (the middl e right) enough to damp the swi ng in the output gap (the bottom left).  Thus, the advice coming from the model is to proceed on the path for policy that you had envisioned before the hurrican e’s landfall. Exhibit 3 addresses that policy choice a little  more colorfully.  The official title of the Bluebook is “Monetary Poli cy Alternatives,” and we certainly delivered on that this time.  [Laughter] We included only tw o explicit policy alternatives: A, in which there is no change in the funds rate; and B, in which it is increased 25 basis points (as noted in the column headings of the table) .  In the associated draft statements, we assumed that you would not want to send a strong signal about future action.  But we also considered descriptions of how you could signal more conviction about the future path—either that it would involve a prolonged pause, A-, or a more substantial ultimate extent of tightening, B+, which is the difference between the “sure” and “unsure” subheadings. In the Bluebook write-up, we assumed you would continue with the “measured pace” language, as in the heading of the first row.  But recognizing the greater uncertainty about the economic outlook, we also included a box describing a new risk formula (the middle row) and the dropping of all guidance (the bottom row).  Three rows by four columns produce 12 alternatives for the statement—a new Bluebook record. [Laughter] We paid more attention to the familiar formulation of alternatives A and B for a reason that would not surprise any vi ewer of C-SPAN over the past week— stare  summarized in the middle panel, stare decisis translates to “let the decision stand” and holds that it is proper to adhere to  precedent and not unsettle things that are established. Justice Frankf urter noted that it “embodies an important social policy that represents an element of continuity and is rooted in the psychological need to satisfy reasonable expectations.” That sentiment favoring delivering the exp ected has been repeated often in this room—not in Latin and not always in Englis h either.  [Laughter] As shown in the bottom left panel, market expectations ha ve settled on roughly a 90 percent weight on a ¼ point firming today.  As the right pane l relates, primary dealers predominantly believe that today’s statement will retain the key features of the prior ones, including describing the Committee’s intention to  continue removing monetary policy accommodation at a measured pace.            88 of 117Some arguments for alternatives A and B are presented in exhibit 4, which begins with those two Rorschach tests for policym akers—the behavior of the real federal funds rate relative to the range of estimates  of its equilibrium (a t the left) and of the nominal federal funds rate rela tive to the range of  predictions from policy rules (at the right). You might favor holding the nominal f unds rate at 3½ percent today if you viewed the real federal funds rate (the solid line at the left) as close enough to its neutral value to afford you some time to assess the effects of cumulative policy firming and the near-term dislocations associated with Hurricane Katrina.  The fact that the current nominal funds rate at the right is within the ra nge of recommendations from standard rules might provide you so me confidence in the decision to pause today. In particular, the information that  accumulates over the next few weeks might be seen as particularly revealing about th e serious downside risk that the disruptions in the Gulf region will sap household and business confidence.  In that regard, the preliminary reading on consumer confidence from the Michigan survey plotted in the middle left panel might be taken as a warn ing flare.  Although that drop was not far from staff expectations, a deeper and more  pronounced slide would be troubling.  One example of the adverse possibilities is th e “sentiment slump” scenario in the Greenbook, which shows the unemployment rate  (graphed as the dotted line in the lower left panel) moving up about ½ percen tage point above the baseline (absent a monetary policy response). Those favoring alternative B probably see less chance that the outlook will clarify materially in the next six weeks, in pa rt because economic data are likely to be contaminated by hurricane effects for months  to come.  And as for those two upper panels, the real rate may have risen considerably, but our models s uggest that it is still likely below its equilibrium level.  A cons tant 3½ percent nomi nal funds rate may now be consistent with most policy rules but it will not be for long, as the green envelope of rate recommendations moves upward over the next year. The case for alternative B might have been strengthened by another element of the Michigan survey released on Friday. As plotted in the middle right panel, one-year-ahead inflation expectations (the solid  line) spiked higher and even the much less volatile longer-term expect ations moved north of 3 perc ent.  In particular, this might have served as an unpleasant re minder of the “deteriorating inflation expectations” scenario in the Greenbook, in which, as at the bottom right, core inflation remains above 2½ percen t through the end of next year. Whatever your choice of policy rate, mark et participants believe, as I already mentioned, that the rest of the statement w ill follow the path laid out in the 11 prior ones. In exhibit 5, I provide draft statem ents should you want to  deviate from that route, presumably because you view th e uncertain economic outlook as rendering              89 of 117forward-looking portions of the current statement no longer a ppropriate.  The upper panel accompanies the policy choice of altern ative B with a risk assessment explicitly conditioned on maintaining the current stance of  policy for the next several quarters.  Should the macro fundamentals play out as  in the Greenbook, output growth is more likely to exceed that of its potential than fall short of it and inflation more likely to increase than decrease at an unchanged f unds rate.  Given that the output gap is already quite thin, neither outcome would seem to be acceptable to the Committee, thereby sending the signal that the funds rate is more likely to rise above 3¾ percent than fall bellow  it. This formula follows the convention since May 2003 of describing the uncertainty about both of the Committee’s goals.  Such  a formula lacks the nuance possible from writing the statement afresh each time.  Bu t experience suggests that the freshness date of the statement passes by very qui ckly given the Committee’s reluctance to change wording that market participants seem to obsess over.  This simple, albeit coarse, formula also might solve the gove rnance issue of how 19 people can agree on the key attributes of a statement in a limited time. The bottom panel is silent about the possible path of the funds rate by dropping the risk assessment and the description of  policy as being accommodative.  This version satisfies the test of simplicity, but  something may be lost in its economy.  These probably are considerations for anothe r day.  I bring them up now, however, to remind you that as the real federal funds rate moves higher into the region where reasonable people can disagree about whet her policy remains accommodative, the time when you will have to deal with the statement’s structure comes closer. The last exhibit provides the latest dr aft of Table 1 from the Bluebook.  This version of the table incor porates a few changes from what you saw in the Bluebook.  The first is stylistic in that, on re-read ing, the last sentence in the paragraph addressing the effects of Hurricane Katrina on energy prices seemed repetitive.  And I think that has been fixed. The other two changes are more substantial, at least from the perspective of the geological time over which the statement evolves.  For one, the characterization of policy accommodation as “remaining” in the last sentence, as proposed in the Bluebook, was not in the A ugust statement and has been struck.  For another, longer-term expectations are “cont ained,” not “well cont ained” as described in the August statement.  Both changes were  made in light of the run-up in inflation compensation and higher readings on infla tion expectations.  That concludes my prepared remarks. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Questions fo r Vincent?  If not, I’ll start. I think the interesting question we have to answer is this:  If Katrina had done the destruction that it did without affecting energy prices, how woul d we view it?  We’ve had over     90 of 117the post-World War II period innumerable supply-si de shocks.  I remember the very prolonged steel strike of 1959, which had a profoundly debil itating effect on the economy overall, and that affected business confidence. When the strike was over, the economy came back with a surge.  Theoretically, one can argue that  the decline in economic activity  as a consequence of a supply-side shock lowers wages, lowers compensation, and hence lowers expenditures.  And one could theorize that a supply-side s hock could bring on a recession. I have never seen that happen. And I suspect the reason is that the underlying psychology associated with the replenishment that  invariably follows a supply-side shock leads to expectations for the future that create forwar d momentum.  I think this current situation is exactly that—a very large supply-side shock which, ex the energy price effect, in my judgment would have gone the way of all such scenario s: There would be a si gnificant short-term retrenchment in activity, perhaps for a number of quarters.  We w ould have the impact on the oil structure and on production and refi ning.  But I submit to you that  the price effect would not have been very high in earlier periods in our history when the crude price was $20 a barrel and when the excess supply in OPEC was several milli on barrels.  In other words, we would have had the cutback in production at refineries and presumably in cr ude oil producti on, but the price effect would have been severely muted. What is different today is something that  has been mentioned several times around the table, namely, that the surplus has been depleted and, therefore, any little variation in supply hits the price. It’s not the crude pr ice that is causing a problem, in my judgment.  It’s the gasoline price. The higher price for gasoline does, of course, contract purchasing power.  But more importantly, it has a very visual impact in that  gasoline is one of the very few commodities—      91 of 117milk may be another one—consumers look at for which they have contin uous price comparisons.  So this particular surge has been very evid ent as we’ve watched consumer attitudes and consumer expenditures over the course of th e gasoline price run-up and especially in the acceleration that occurr ed after August 29. One fascinating thing about this is that we used to talk a bout the crude pr ice as though it were a substitute for the gasoline price, and that is dramatically different this time.  What we have found is that the best way of viewing the mar kup from crude prices to gasoline prices is to weight WTI 60 percent and the heav ier crude, Maya, 40 percent.  Th is traces the gasoline price reasonably well, with a relatively stable mar kup from the weighted crude price through the refining margin, through the marketing margin, and into the retail price. What has happened since the big surge and the presumed shortfall in production is that the price for regular unleaded gasoline has gone up, as you know, to over $3 a gallon and the weighted crude price has gone up to $1.50 a gallon, which is the equivalent of about a $60 per barrel average weighted price. After accounting for taxes, this is a $1.10 spread per gallon.  The fairly narrow, normal spread is 50 cents.  So we have a 60 cent surge here, and it’s showing up partly in refinery margins, but in truly spectacular  marketing margins.  And it’s clear that this is utterly unsustainable because if ther e is an industry in this country that is highly competitive, it is the neighborhood service station.  The people running those st ations are looking at their competitors across the street and down the block, and they are continuously adjusting their prices. So the question here is: What has happened?  Well, what has happened is obviously refinery breakdown in two forms.  One, we’ve clearly squeezed out any excess capacity in the    92 of 117United States. And two, in the process, we’ve had very considerable difficulty as well in refining the heavier crude oils.  That gives us a worldwide mi smatch between the type of crude oils we produce, which are more sour and heav ier, and the growing needs for petroleum products that are increasingly for transportation, which of c ourse include gasoline, diesel, and a lot of the lighter products. And essentially the producti on of those lighter products requires a very substantial transformation of the heavier crudes. While we’re in better shape than Europe with  respect to the balance of catalytic cracking and coking operations, we don’t have  enough.  As a consequence, we’re running into very severe pressures where the price margins are opening up c onsiderably, especially for those refiners who have the capacity to refine heavier and heavily discounted crudes. By the end of the year we’ll have the capaci ty back on line that, as Karen mentioned, is currently off line. It will gradually creep up. Ther e is at this particular stage a very significant number of tankers moving in our direction that  are loaded with motor gasoline produced in Europe, which under EPA regulations would not be ab le to be sold here.  We import a little over a million barrels a day of gasoline, and a lot of it is reformulated basically into a form which meets EPA requirements but just barely.  Havi ng dropped the EPA requirements has opened up a substantial amount of the less stylized gasolines for the United  States, and those products are going to hit our shores in a matter of weeks.  In fact, that should  start relatively soon. So we should have those products shortly unle ss Rita turns out to be a really serious problem, and it may.  But if you take a look at the probability distribution on the path of Rita, a goodly chunk of it is in northern Mexico and even east of New Orleans.  They don’t need that, of course. It’s not as if they’ve missed the chaos and they need more of it.  It will be a real mess.     93 of 117But the point here is that the worst on the gasoline price is close to being over unless there is significant further damage to the refineries  in the Houston area and below, which at this stage is conjectural. Fi rst of all, we’re making the assumpti on that the waters of the Gulf of Mexico are somewhat warmer and that, therefor e, that can turn just a plain storm into a hurricane. Right now they’re talking a categ ory 1, 2, or possibly 3 hurricane, but they’re guessing. They don’t really know; and the reason th ey’re guessing is that it’s not possible to know because there are too many variables.  It reminds me a little of the Kenneth Arrow anecdote; it’s not quite the same but  there’s a lot of that involved.   The markets are very sensitive.  Having seen what happened with Katrina, they’re trying to discount—probably well over di scount—the possibilities associat ed with Rita.  As you know, prices have come down today; the last time I looked, the crude price was down over a dollar and gasoline was down 7 to 10 cents a ga llon after a big run-up yesterday. At some point reasonably soon we’re going to see gasoline prices move down.  Ex Rita, they will go from over $3.00 a gallon at the pump down to probably $2.60.  That is a very big move, and that will take out a significant amount of the consumer confidence erosion and conceivably the business confiden ce erosion—which I can see out there, and I think several of you have mentioned it—which, in turn, is a conse quence of the erosion in consumer confidence. So I think that, short of the cavea t of Rita, the scenario is not all that uncertain.  There is no historical precedent to suggest th at we can keep margins at the refining and marketing levels anywhere near where they are. We know why th ey are there; there was a supply-side shutdown.  But the supply will be coming back, and indeed, imports from Europe are going to be quite substantial.    94 of 117If that occurs, then clearly what we will have  is a situation where the outlook is still very significantly restrained.  Consumer outlays wi ll be constrained because gasoline at $2.60 per gallon is not something that will galvanize a great deal of consumption.  So, over the next number of months the economy will be fairly weak, but it’s going to be difficult to differentiate what part is the supply side a nd what part is not.  As a c onsequence, there’s going to be considerable confusion and much, much less cert ainty than has been exhibited in financial So we’re going into a period where the one thi ng we can say for certain is that the level of uncertainty is going to be rising, and it’s going to be rising on two sides.  It’s going to be rising presumably on the output side—and we’re goi ng to be uncertain whether it’s related to supply or demand—and almost assuredly on the pri ce side.  The reason I say that is because we’ve been seeing a gradual upward creep in financial expectations, and none of us has experienced anything like this in 20 years.  I guess I remember more of the pre-1980 period than most anyone around this table, and this has that very p eculiar feel to it.  It st arts very slowly.  It’s ambiguous.  It’s disputable and unforecastable, but it grows and grows and grows.  If you just look at the pattern, the change is usually too sm all in any short-term period to jolt you until you look back and say: “This has been growing for quite  a while.”  And then it starts to accelerate, largely because inflation expectations begin to erode .  That’s what the history is. It’s very tough to forecast, but we have been through an ex ceptionally long period of disinflation, which has brought actual inflation expect ations down and term premiums  down.  Everything is at its bottom.  There is nowhere for them to go except up.     95 of 117And one of the characteristics of these type s of markets is that when things are going down there is an expectational variable that says  they are going to go down further.  In other words, the first difference matters.  But when they get down as low as they are, the first difference goes to zero no matter what one can say about it because they can’t go any lower.  And that starts to change the pattern. I don’t know what the probabilities of this are.  Anybody who makes a confident forecast of a turn like I’ve just been discussing is rea lly reaching, and I am reach ing.  All I’m basically reaching to say is that I think the possibilities out there are a lot wider than we’re envisaging in the Greenbook. The fiscal situation in this coun try has gotten to be scary.  There is nobody who wants to forgo a free lunch. There are big discus sions about whether we ought to cut taxes or raise spending. There are very few who think in  terms of whether we should worry about the deficit. Indeed, all one has to do is go out ther e and suggest, as I rather foolishly do on occasion, how Congress could curtail expenditures in a very reasonable way.  Do you think everyone applauds?  Not exactly. We’ve lost our moorings.  These budgets are out  of control.  The reason I say that is because ever since the surpluses—which did more damage to fiscal discipline than I could conceivably have believed—nobody finds any political  purpose in showing restraint.  That means inflation premiums are going to build into l ong-term interest rates at  some point.  I don’t know when, but it’s out there somewhere. In any event, one of the things that we know with some reasonable certainty is that, unlike in previous periods, this  sharp rise in prices is runni ng into a degree of short-term elasticity, especially for gasoline, that I don’t think we were  anticipating.  Seasonally adjusted,    96 of 117weekly domestic demand for gasoline is off very sh arply in recent weeks.  Now, that’s not to say gasoline consumption necessarily is going dow n.  It only means that primary shipments including imports are down 600,000 to 800,000 barrels a day.  What may be happening is that gasoline stations are essentially  running down their inventorie s—which incidentally are not small—and the tanks in motor vehicles that c onsume gasoline are being run down.  The primary published data on gasoline inventories—that would mean at primary terminals—is 200 million barrels now. That has come down significantly. On average, gasoline service station inventor ies are about 80 million barrels.  Taking the average capacity of fuel tanks and figuring the pr obable level of gasoline in those tanks, that’s another 60 million.  It’s conceivable that those numbers went down a great deal and hence the actual consumption of gasoline has not gone dow n anywhere near as much as the domestic demand.  That strikes me as highly unlikely because if one is dealing with shortages, there is a tendency, if anything, for service stat ions to get more rather than le ss gasoline.  It’s only in areas where there has been some form of rationi ng—even though they call it something else—that some stations have run out of gasoline.  But, in general, there’s very little questi on in my mind that we’ve run into something different—namely, a significant drop in gasoline  consumption.  That means that people are driving less, since the stock of cars hasn’t changed.  Indeed, if you look at the overall unit use of energy, including oil, in the nonf inancial, non-energy corporat e sector—as David mentioned— the actual per unit weighted amount of fuel per dollar of gross nonfinancial, non-energy corporate product has been going down fairly quick ly.  And I might add that a big chunk of it is in natural gas, which is natural gas demand destruction, not just conservation.  So, the implied     97 of 117efficiency numbers are not as great as they have been.  But one of the reasons why the profit significant amount of productivity going on, which mean s that oil has less of an effect than it used to. So we’re not seeing great damage as yet to margins.  Indeed, on a monthly basis we find that margins of nonfinancial, non-energy corporations—doing data calcula tions obviously quite roughly—flattened out from March to June.  Now,  it’s hard to know what was going on in July and August. There has to be some compression. I don’t see how it could be otherwise, but we don’t have any data on that. Basically, I come down to th e obvious question, which is of  a twofold nature.  If we choose to pause today, one obvious thing that is going to happen is that the federal funds futures curve, which now still gradually goes up even though it eventually flattens out, is going to flatten sharply. Then there’s the point that President Santomero made a bout the fact that the economy is going to be showing poor data over  the next number of months.  So, the statement that we are going to resume raising rates at some point soon is just not credible.  The markets won’t believe it, and for very good reason—because the data, at l east in the short run, ar e not going to give a rationale for raising rates largely because it’s not going to be clear what is  the supply-side effect and what is the demand-side effect.  That c onfusion is going to stay  with us for a while. So I agree that if we want to restore the path of further interest rate increases, it’s going to be next year, but it’s going to be next year in th e face of what in my judgment is going to be a set of heightened inflationary forces.  And if th at is the case, we will be way behind the curve because what we are looking at for sure is less economic output and more inflation, though the       98 of 117precise combination is not easy to determine.  But if you have a measure of stagflation about which we could say we had virtua lly none of it a year ago, we’re be ginning to get some of it.  We’re trading off increased nominal GDP for real GDP.  And this sort of process is going to continue for a while. I think that pausing at this stage is highly ri sky, but not so much because of the issue of our technical capability to come back to our path  and explain why we’re ra ising rates.  We could do it. We’re an independent agency.  If we saw very poor data but saw inflationary forces, we could raise rates. I think we’d run into very se rious explanatory problems,  and I think at the end of the day we wouldn’t do it. I fear that  we wouldn’t, even though we probably should. The question, therefore, gets down not so much to the notion of perception and our ability to move, but to what is the right thing to do.  And the right thing to do in my judgment is to recognize, as several of you have mentioned, that th e real risk imbalance is on the inflation side.  If it turns out that we rais e the funds rate today—I don’t know what we’re going to do thereafter—and the economy actually shows a weakening beyond the supply-side or gasoline­price-induced  weakness, we have the capacity to move the rate back down sharply.  For example, after 9/11, we opened up the faucets.  On Oc tober 19, 1987, we just opened everything up.  Nobody is going to complain if we suddenly reve rse and start to pump money into the system, because the reasons for our doing that will be self-evident. If, however, we pause here and the outcome I fear materializes, we could run into problems.  I want to emphasize that I’m not pret ending I know what the probabilities of that are.  All I’m stipulating is that, on the basis of my experience, I sense th at they are larger than we’re projecting, mainly because our projections are based on the experience of the last 20 years.  And     99 of 117the period of the last 20 years has been the most  extraordinary period of beneficence in economic policy that I can imagine, helped a good deal by globalization and the excess of intended saving over intended investment. This period is going to end at some point.  I think it’s just too risky to try to guess when that is going to be. And we ought  to have a sufficient buffer out there when we start to run into some troubles because we don’t seem to be able in  this country to have buffers on anything.  For example, we allowed our excess electric capacity to run down in California, as it did a few years ago. We’ve allowed our oil refinery capacity to run down.  I can name a number of other examples in non-energy related areas.  But what we de finitely need at this stage is a buffer in the monetary policy area to be sure we’re well positioned if it turns out  that we’re running into the early stages of stagflation. If it turns out that is not the case, all to the better.  We may have put in more insurance than was necessary, but that insu rance, in my judgment, is very well worth the cost. So I would opt for a 25 basis point increa se in the funds rate wi th the language in the statement essentially that of alternativ e B in its most recently revised form. Comments?

By just increasi ng the funds rate 25 basis points now, if it does not change market expectations about the future, I think we will not be doing the full job.  In any event, as I say, I retain my pr eference for no change but with a very clear statement of concern about inflation and the highly likely need for more restraint in the future.
