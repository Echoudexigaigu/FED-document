CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morn ing, everyone.  Before we ge t started, I just want to thank you for what was an extraord inary evening for me and also a big surprise.  I appreciate not  only that all of you showed up but, as best I can judge, that  virtually everyone else who was physically able to do so also  showed up.  So, it was great. On to official business.  Mr. Kos, please. MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The now lengthy period of tight spreads and low volatilities continued in the inte rmeeting period.  That was despite some unexpected credit events, another hurri cane, and increased talk about upside inflation risks. The top panel on page 1 graphs the 3-m onth deposit rate in black and the same rate three and nine months forward in re d.  The 3- and 9-month forward rates rose 47 and 53 basis points, respectively, as ma rket participants absorbed incoming data and, even more, comments by Committee members expressing heightened levels of concern about upsi de inflation risks.    Many market participants now assume that the Committee will tighten during each of the next four meetings, including the first meeting to be presided over by the new Chairman.  The tone of market  expectations—at least among traders as opposed to Street economists—has changed a bit.  Earlier this summer the betting was about where the co-called “neutral” rate resides.  The assumption was that the Committee would stop in that neighborhood. Now, with increased concern about inflation, the question of wher e neutrality resides is sl owly being superseded by a new question: How far beyond “neutral” will policy need to go to dampen inflationary pressures? The yield curve rose across maturities, as shown in the middle panel.  The 2-year Treasury yield rose 40 basis poin ts while the 10-year yield rose 30, apparently affected in part by MBS-related hedging flows.  The 2-year yield is at its highest level since Ma y 2001.  The shape of the curve narrowed by 10 basis points and sits at a relatively narrow 17 basis points.     While the conversation in markets was about inflation, interestingly, break-even inflation rates from TIPS [Treasury in flation-protected securities] were little              4 of 114changed, as seen in the bottom panel.  Th e 2-year break-even in flation [BEI] rate had risen over the summer as energy prices rallied; but it plateaued and came off a bit as the price of oil headed back do wn.  The 10-year BEI was little changed. This suggests that the rise in nominal yi elds was an increase in real rates and suggestive of tightened financial conditions.  The sluggishness in equity markets until this past Friday was consistent with this view. The behavior of break-even rates also cal ls into question some of the instant analysis surrounding Ben Bernanke’s nom ination last Monday.  While some analysts were quick to attribute the rise  in nominal yields last week to the nomination—on the basis of some perceive d squishiness on inflation—the rise in real yields, which had alrea dy been in train, and the fl atness of BEIs do not bear this out. If there is some suggestion that fi nancial conditions are tightening, the evidence elsewhere was mixed.  Certainly, yields in other major economies have been moving higher since the end of the summer, as shown in the top panel of page 2. Long-term sovereign yields in the U.K., Canada, and Germany—the latter as a proxy for the euro area—have b een rising recently.  The rise of nearly 40 basis points in German yields has been particularly noteworthy and may reflect upgraded forecasts for European growth in general and improved sentiment toward Germany, notwithstanding a messy el ection outcome that leaves prospects for reform uncertain. Even Japanese yields have been rising recently.  Investors are increasingly contemplating that maybe, just maybe, af ter so many false starts, this time the recovery is for real.  The better economic tempo and heightened probabilities that sometime in the next 12 months the CP I will no longer be preceded by a negative sign are leading more invest ors to take a defensive posture toward Japanese bonds. Expectations about near-term policy in  those same countries are broadly consistent with the movement in longer-d ated yields.  The middle panel graphs and the euro area. Short sterling futures are flat—in itself noteworthy, given that the Bank of England most recently eased policy.  The others are all moving upward to varying degrees.  The middle  right panel graphs the December 2006 euro-yen deposit futures contract, which has also risen as the market tries to anticipate the end of the Ba nk of Japan’s [BOJ] quantitative easing policy, now expected by the market—and the BOJ, as reported in the monthly report yesterday—to be sometime in the fiscal year beginning on April 1. If the developed world provides evid ence that financial conditions are tightening, the same cannot be said for the emerging markets.  The EMBI [Emerging Market Bond Index] spread was little changed and is at historically tight levels. Despite higher dollar rates,  the central banks of  Brazil and Mexico              5 of 114have both been able to ease monetary policy—albeit from high levels—in recent days and weeks, as reflected in the bo ttom panels.  Brazil and Colombia have managed to issue local-currency-denominate d debt in the international market at attractive rates, as have some private bo rrowers in Asia.  This decoupling from policy rates in the major economies stands in  sharp contrast to previous cycles.  And to emerging market bulls, it reflects a better policy mix, higher reserves, and a strong global economy. As with emerging markets, the byword in domestic credit markets seemed to be “what, me worry?”  Despite some hi gh-profile bankruptcies in airlines, auto parts, and the surprise co llapse of Refco, credit market s were not flustered and took the news in stride. As shown in the top panels on page 3, both investment-grade and high-yield spreads moved only s lightly and remained at historically tight levels. The bankruptcies of Delta and Northwes t were dismissed, having been long expected. The Delphi bankruptcy was al so broadly expected.  And yet when it happened, protection for General Motors in  the CDS [credit default swap] market temporarily shot higher, as shown in th e middle panel.  The prospect that GM might have to absorb billions of dollars of additional pensi on costs got traders’ attention. Ford Motor CDS rates were al so affected.  But the broader Dow Jones CDX high-yield index—comprised of 100 single names—was little changed.  One collapse that was not expected was that of Refco, whose fraud was made public the morning of October 10 and wh ich filed for bankruptcy on October 17.  Refco is a small corporate bond issuer but  it does have linkages to firms across Wall Street.  All in all, the stress emanating from Refco was limited.  The rather busy graph at the bottom of page 3 depicts credit default swap rates for eight major financial firms since January.  Note  the temporary increase in the price of protection for these firms in the spring, when GM and Ford were downgraded and the so-called “correlation trades” began to go bad.  In contrast, the Refco news did not even register a blip in CDS rates. Overall, markets are posing something of a puzzle.  The rise in real yields and the fall in equity prices for most of Se ptember and October suggest a tightening of financial conditions. There were both  expected and unexpected bankruptcy filings. Yet both emerging markets and do mestic credit markets were unfazed, and money continues to seek higher-yielding assets.  Maybe  it really is different this time.  Then again, maybe the reaction will come with a lag that is longer than usual. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.          6 of 114CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Th ank you.  I notice that we still don’t endeavor to calculate the implicit 2- or 5-year break- even inflation rates—subtracting ou t the implicit CPI forecast from what the futures markets are telling us about energy prices to get in ferentially what the CPI ex food and energy would be if one presumes that the en ergy futures markets are arbitraged against the TIPS. MR. KOS.  I may be wrong, but didn’t we do— 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. We have a cottage  industry, Mr. Chairman.    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I don’t recall seeing any calculations recently.  MR. KOS.  I think this question came up about a year ago, and Vincen t was summarizing the work that had been done. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. What we do is take the energy futures curve, take th e weight in the CPI— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, but I never saw the result. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. Actually, Gover nor Ferguson saw something very similar just this week. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  still doesn’t answer my  question!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. I guess the answer is that yo u do have a need to know, and you will!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, can you just give me a hint as to what  I’m going to learn? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. In previo us episodes, increases in  spot oil pri ces had brought the spot rate well above the longer-ahead futures rate, which im plied that market partic ipants were expecting inflation compensation to be goi ng down because of the anticipat ed decline in energy prices.  Relative to those episodes, this time around the curve is relatively flat, so you don’t have that.  And it’s a more permanent effect.  It affects the very near-term part of  the curve, but it’s a relatively small weight in  the total.                   7 of 114CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. Thank you.  On page 2 in th e upper left-hand chart, I notice that the relationshi p among these sovereign de bt yields, which we’ve been looking at for a long time, have gradually morphed from fairly low correlation to extremely high correlation. Do we have any rolling correlation coefficien ts that suggest when that happened and the presumptive hypotheses as to why?  Are we looking at the same issu es that I inadvertently called a conundrum early this year?  Or is this going back well before then? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. You know, I haven’t looked at the rolling correlation coefficients recently. Certainly, there have been epis odes, going back at least a deca de, when these ra tes moved very, very closely; 1994 was a period— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  For a while. MR. KOS.  Right.  Then the corr elation sort of breaks down and th en it starts up again.  I don’t know if Karen knows more about a date, but over the past couple of years they have been moving pretty tightly. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I would sa y that has been the cas e since moving out of  the recession—since early 2003 or something like that.  We benchmark this co rrelation from time to time.  I don’t know that we’ve done it quite as a rolling corre lation but we ea sily could, and we will. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  You know , the rolling coefficient is a measure of the degree of globalization. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. It is. It’s al so, though, indicative of the nature of th e shocks that are perceived by market participants.  So, to the extent  those are idiosyncratic to individual countries, it tends to cause the correlation to fall  apart.  To the extent they are perceived to be global, those rates move together.                   8 of 114On top of that is the is sue of whether or not portfolio holders  are holding a sufficiently diverse portfolio that any adjustment they might make in response to a shoc k is going to be spread across that they’re looking for.  And there’s some of that  going on.  That’s, I thin k, what you mean by the term globalization—that portfolio hold ers, by the way they adjust thei r portfolios, do some of this.  But it’s certainly true that this comes and goes a bit, and we can look to see how the correlation coefficient has developed. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’ve had the vague impr ession that it’s been exceptionally tight over the most recent period, more so than I recall.  This chart doesn’t suggest spikes of any type, but it suggests just plain old-fashioned arbitrage. On the Brazilian and Colo mbian issuances you referred to, I presume these were issued in their local currencies? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Denominated in local currencies? CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. MR. KOS. The Brazilian is sue was denominated in reals , but actually the payments will be in dollars.  It’s indexed back to reals , so the exchange rate risk is wholly with  the investor. CHA

[SECTION]

IRMAN GREENSPAN.  Why are they do ing that?  Why not just pay off in reals ? MR. KOS. Well, they are able to get a much more attractive rate.  The spread that they’re able to get— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do you mean the principal is  guaranteed in dollars? MR. KOS.  The principal is repaid in dollars. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You mean it’s guaranteed in— MR. KOS.  No.  The pa yment is in dollars.          9 of 114CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. But it’s indexed to the exchange rate. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Wait a second. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. In other words, the fl ow of payments you receive is in dollars.  When you get your money back, you will be paid dollars. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. For th e old Brady bonds the prin cipal was guaranteed in dollars. That is not what this is. MR. KOS.  That’s right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, it’s not clear to me why they ar e doing that.  If you have a freely floating exchange rate —if I understand what you’re telling me—the holder can just as easily get the payment in reals  and convert it to dollars. MR. KOS. For reasons that I can’t fully explain,  the spread that Brazi l was able to get by doing it this way has been much tighter. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Well, I think these securities were targ eted to internationa l investors more.  I find it a little puzzling why it  works this way, but it  was not the case that th ese were sold into the domestic market and happen ed to be bought by  international folk and, th erefore, isn’t that a good sign. These were really targeted for foreign investors, denominated in the domestic cu rrencies, so as to give them the Brazilian interest rate and the Colo mbian interest rate.  It  is thought that people who are searching for yield would want to add these sorts of securities to th eir portfolios, and they did. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Bu t isn’t the only diff erence that should exist the transaction cost of the conversi on of the currency?            10 of 114MR. REINHART. Mr. Chairman, there is also conversion ri sk.  That is , a sovereign government at a later date could limit what its curr ency could be used for.  Witness all the capital controls in the ’50s and ’60s. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. So, in principl e, if you’re guaranteed the payments in do llars, you know you’ll get dollars rather than reals  that perhaps couldn’t be used  for as many th ings later on. CHA

[SECTION]

IRMAN GREENSPAN.  You really begin to get a multiple exchange rate  type of thing.  So that would explain part of it.  If that’s the case, however, does the investor know which particular exchange rate he will be hit with?  It doesn ’t strike me that that’s a great defense. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. No. You are basi cally taking on country  risk and exchange  rate risk when you buy these issues. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is the Colombian issue the same? MR. KOS.  I’m not as familiar wi th the Colombian one.   I don’t remember the details of that. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I’m not sure eith er.  In Colombia’s case, given that ther e is to a certain extent a dollar component of their economy— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  This is not the status of the Mexican peso issue of several years ago, which was just a pure local currency fo r the first time ever. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Ac tually, I believe Colombia ’s was pure local currency, domestic, at a 10-year ma turity for the first time  in a long time.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  On the bottom of page 3, are these brokerage sector CDS?  Is this the mix of thei r individual portfolios or their estimates of the total market? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. No, no. This is if you want to buy protection on, say, Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns.  This is the price of  protection on these firms.                11 of 114CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Oh, this is the actual credit defau lt swap on Lehman Brothers or on— MR. KOS.  Yes, all eight of them. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. This te lls you a good deal about the individual firms.  That’s interesting. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Ther e’s a moral hazard in there, too, if you look at it.  [Laughter]

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’m go ing back in the private sect or.  I’ve got to know who’s risky! [Laughter]  That wa s off the record.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. This comes from a private-sector fi rm, so there’s no inside information here. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Dino, did I hear yo u correctly?  What is  the probability of a move in March? MR. KOS.  The probability, based on fed funds futures, I think is pretty lo w right now.  My point was more about the way that pe ople in the markets are slowly comi ng to view the situation.  In this cycle, they’ve been looking two to three meetings ahead.  But the next few meetings are a bit different, obviously.  I believe traders are thinking that the po licy moves over the next couple of meetings are more or less baked in the cake.  Th e new Chairman won’t want  to be in the position where he has to “stop” and confirm the dovish suspicions of some of  the folks out there.  So that gets you to the next four meetings , basically.  But that fourth one I don’t think is in the fed funds futures.           12 of 114MR. REINHART. Mr. Vice Chairman, the expected fund s rate in April, which is a fairly clean reading on the March meeting—is about 5 or 6 basis points above 4½ pe rcent.  So that puts a 25 percent probability of action there.

MR. LACKER. Yes.  I apologize for even asking this.  I may have become co lor-blind this morning, but I can’t tell which firm s are which at the bottom of page 3.   There are two tiers, right?  Don’t tell me all of them, but which ones are at the bottom?

[SECTION]

. STOCKTON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairma n.  Most people that I know really seem to dislike how early holiday deco rations go up at the shopping malls these days. Not me. I=m a forward-looking kind of guy w ho likes to plan ahead.  You folks are already on my mind, and I know what would make the perfect holiday gift for you this year: The answers to two questions.  How much more will monetary policy need to be  tightened to secure stable prices and maximum employment?  And, how will you know when  you have reached that point?  Unfortunately, Nieman Marcus is not carryi ng that gift this year, so you will have to settle for the usual from me—another Greenbook forecast.  Yes, I know that =s about as exciting as a new pair of socks on Christmas morning.  But on the assumption that it =s the thought that counts, I =ll offer my thoughts on those questions this morning.           13 of 114Obviously, there is an explicit answer in the Greenbook to the question of how much farther tightening will need to procee d, and our answer is not much farther.  We have assumed that the funds rate tops  out at 4¼ percent by the end of the year—a figure only slightly below current market expectations that place the peak at a bit above 4½ percent. In setting that path, we needed to consider both the current momentum of the economy and the principal forces likely to be shaping the contours of aggregate demand over the next two years. At the time of the September Green book, we had expected Hurricane Katrina to exert noticeable restraint on economic activity over the remainder of the second half. The anticipated drag reflected di sruptions to production in the region, as well as the broader response of consumer  spending to the steep run-up in retail energy prices that followed in the wake of  the storm.  But we saw this shock as hitting an economy that had retained considerable momentum over the summer months and did not think that it would be  of sufficient dimension to derail the expansion. Since then we have grappled with the effects of Hurricane Rita, which further slammed the energy-producing sector in the Gulf Coast and put added upward pressure most notably on the price of natural gas, and Hurricane Wilma, which caused disruption and property damage in Fl orida.  Much as we had anticipated six weeks ago, we are now in a thick data fog that makes it difficult to separate the underlying trend in the economy from the influence of the storms.  But we are feeling increasingly comforta ble arguing that the data support our earlier view that the economy would retain  its momentum this fall.  To begin, payroll employment fell in Sept ember, but that decline was not as large as we had expected, and the BLS [B ureau of Labor Statistics] noted that employment gains outside the areas aff ected by Katrina were on pace with those earlier in the year. Industr ial production took a very la rge hit in September from the combined effects of the hurricanes and the Boeing strike, but absent those factors, factory output appare ntly would have picked up noticeably in that month.  And reports from purchasing managers i ndicate that these gains are likely to continue in the period immediately ahead. As you know, we received the BEA =s [Bureau of Economic Analysis] advance estimate of third-quarter GDP last w eek after the Greenbook was completed.  Real GDP is estimated to have increased 3.8 percent at an annual  rate last quarter, about ½ percentage point above our forecast.  At this point, we have found no major reasons to quarrel with the BEA and would probably revise up our forecast of the third quarter toward th eir estimate.  We also didn =t see much in that release that would cause us to revise our project ed increase in real GDP of 3½ percent in the fourth quarter. In any event, taking a ll of this information together, we see the economy as having been at least as str ong, if not a bit stronger, than we had anticipated in the September Greenbook.            14 of 114We project activity to advance at a 3¾  percent pace in the first half of 2006, similar to that in the sec ond half of this year.  We are expecting that rebuilding efforts and government transfer payments  will be providing a noticeable lift to activity during that period.  But aside from those influences, broader macroeconomic forces are projected to slow the pace of activity as we move through 2006 and 2007. Tighter monetary  policy, waning wealth effects— including a slowdown in house price a ppreciation—and diminishing fiscal stimulus all work to brake the current momentum in activity.  Those effects are only partly offset by some  support to disposable in comes and spending from a projected fall in energy prices. All told, th e growth of real GDP is expected to be close to the pace of potential during th e next two years—a bit above it in 2006 and a bit below it in 2007. Viewed from a slightly different persp ective, the gradual but steady tightening of monetary policy over the past year and a half has moved the real federal funds rate into the range of estimates of the equi librium real rate.  That assessment is not idiosyncratic to the Greenbook. The model-based estimates that we provide to you in the Bluebook are in the same ballpark. These estimates of the equilibrium real rate remain a bit to the low side of historical norms, but that seems reasonabl e to us for two reasons.  First, the investment share of output has recovere d over the past several years, but it remains below trend.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, the external sector continues to siphon off a noticeable po rtion of domestic demand.  These influences persist in our proj ection, suggesting to us that real rates will need to be a little lower than usual over the next two years.  Of course, it is worth remembering that a 70 percent confiden ce interval around the estimates of the equilibrium real rate is 2 percentage points wide—so ther e is plenty of scope for reasonable women and men to come to different views on this issue.  That is especially so because the estimates of r*  do not indicate th e level of rates necessary to produce any specific desired rate of inflation. Those wide confidence intervals sugg est that the answ er to the second question, how will you know when an appropriate stopping point has been reached, will be far from obvious. After all, under our baseline projection, real GDP will be growing at a 3¾ percent rate in the first half of next year—faster than potential.  To be sure, as I noted earlier, we will attribute that to rebuilding effects, but it will be hard to have mu ch conviction about our ability to estimate the size of those effects.  Moreover,  on our forecast, core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] inflation will be edging up early next year to a pace just shy of 2½ percent. The difficulty is that the case for stoppi ng soon is predicated on developments that remain forecasts rather than facts.  For example, any diminishment of the impetus to household spending from rising wealth will depend importantly on the course of house prices. We are projecti ng house prices to decelerate from this           15 of 114year= s 10 percent increase to 4 percent in  2006 and 2½ percent in 2007.  We seem to be hearing with greater frequency anecdotes of some cooling in housing Fiscal policy also is an important element in the projected slowing of economic activity over the next two years.  After hurricane-related spending tails off over the first half of next year, we ar e expecting real federal purchases to be about flat over the remainder of the proj ection period.  We have been encouraged by the heightened concern being expr essed by many on Capitol Hill about the deteriorating fiscal picture and the need for greater spending discipline.  Indeed, our assumed $85 billion hurricane-relief package that appeared so modest compared with the figures being bandied a bout at the time of the last meeting is looking pretty good right now. But whether that translates into more durable discipline is obviously open to question. So the bottom line is that, as we move into next year, you are likely to have data in hand that continue to suggest solid expansion, but a forecast of some noticeab le slowing by the second half of next year and into 2007. Confronted with this situation, one c ould approach the staff projection in a manner similar to that with which Pres ident Reagan approached the Soviet Union—trust, but verify.  In other words, continue to tighten until the data show more convincingly the effects of policy re straint.  Along those lines, we included in the Greenbook a simulation that laid out  the consequences of steadily raising the funds rate to 5 percent by the meeting in May 2006.  This additional tightening drops the growth of real GDP to  just a bit above 2¼ percent late next year and into 2007; and with growth be low that of potential, the unemployment rate rises to about 5½ percent by the e nd of the projection period.  Core PCE inflation edges down to 1¾ percent that ye ar, and further disinflation would be in train beyond the forecast horizon.  Dependi ng on your policy preferences, this outcome might not even be characterized as an “overshooting” but rather simply establishing more firmly a core inflat ion rate comfortably below 2 percent. Of course, there are considerable risks surrounding the baseline projection, and some of those risks would be amplif ied by a more aggressive tightening of policy. One obvious concern is that at so me point the tightening of policy could trigger a more pronounced retrenchment in spending and activity. In that regard, there are a few straws in the wind worthy of your attention, most of which are centered in the hous ehold sector.  Motor vehicle sales have dropped off sharply since July, and consum er spending excluding motor vehicles slowed noticeably over the same period and is estimated to have actually declined in September.  So we are heading into the fourth quarter on a weak note.  The softening of spending has also coincided w ith a steep drop in consumer sentiment.  And all of this has occurred in advance of households receiving some very hefty heating bills this winter.           16 of 114Should these developments portend a more  sustained weakening in consumer spending, there could be consequences fo r business sentiment as well; business attitudes never seemed to shift convinci ngly from caution to exuberance in this expansion, and the continued solid gain s in capital spending that underpin our forecast might not materialize if the st rength and durability of the economic expansion were calle d into question. I should stress that this is not how we are reading the recen t data.  The slump in motor vehicle sales looks to us like a payback for the extraordinary spike that occurred this summer; the drop in othe r consumer spending in September most likely reflected the disruptions associat ed with hurricanes; and declines in consumer sentiment, like the stock mark et, have predicted many more recessions than have actually occurred over the years. We don =t yet see the signs of cyclical contraction. But then agai n, if truth be told, we rarely do much in advance. Of course, we see some prominent risks on the other side of our baseline projection, and some of those risks woul d be moderated by a more aggressive tightening of policy. One risk is that  we are underestimating the underlying strength of the expansion, and that left unattended this momentum will carry the economy beyond its potential.  Certainly, last week =s stronger-than-expected estimate of third-quarter real GDP provide s some support to this concern.  With pressures on business costs intense, an  overshooting could result in a further deterioration in the inflation picture.  Our view that the aggregate supply curve is relatively flat implies the deterioration in  inflation would probably be small, but it also implies that wringing out the added inflation would be costly.  Furthermore, any tendency for inflation expectations  to come unmoored would simply compound the costs of moving inflation ba ck into a more comfortable zone. While I acknowledge these concerns, I don =t, in fact, believe that the risks to our inflation projection are skewed to th e upside.  As you know from reading the Greenbook, we are expecting that the furthe r run-up in energy prices in recent months will pass through into core infla tion early next year and that the higher headline inflation that we have experienced this year and last will result in some modest increase in inflation expectations th at feed back into the growth of labor costs. However, to date, indications of a noticeable deteriora tion in inflation expectations are largely limited to the ve ry recent step-up in the Michigan Survey measures, which occurred in the wake of the spike in gasoline prices in our expectations and certai nly provided few hints of any sizable acceleration.  If inflation expectations remain firmly an chored, then there may be little to no increase in core price inflation next year.  So, in sum, I am confident that we will be wrong, but I don =t know in which direction.            17 of 114You know, the only drawback to shopping early is that you have longer to second-guess your choices. After work ing on these remarks over the past few days, I have begun to wonder whether 19 pa irs of socks would not have been the more considerate gift. [Laughter] Karen will continue our remarks.

MS. JOHNSON. The staff forecast for re al GDP growth and inflation abroad is little changed this time from the forecast in the September Greenbook.  This is the case despite additional hurricanes, volat ile energy prices, and a notable rise in long-term interest rates in several foreign industrial countries during the intermeeting period.  The futures path for WTI [West Texas intermediate] crude oil prices retraced somewhat in October.  Accordingly, we have incorporated into this forecast global oil pri ces through 2007 that are about  $2 per barrel lower than in the previous forecast.  Nevertheless , the outlook for global crude oil prices remains elevated at about $60 per barrel for WTI and is more than $8 above the level six months ago. Clearly, factors related to crude oil suppl y have contributed at times to upward pressure on global crude oil prices. In a ddition to disruptions as a result of the hurricanes, there are market concerns about the change in leadership in Saudi Arabia, politics in Iran, Venezuela, and Russia, and reduced production as a result of violence in Iraq. However, the tre nd increase since 2003 in not only spot prices but also in far futures prices occurred despite expansion of global oil production, evidence that underlying globa l demand for crude oil is also importantly responsible for the price pressures.  This persistent, strong, underlying demand for energy reflects funda mental robustness in global economic activity—perhaps more than has been gene rally recognized.  As a consequence, we have observed during this year further moves up in energy prices and in prices for nonfuel primary commodities along with av erage real growth abroad that has remained moderately strong, althoug h a bit below the rapid pace of 2004. As in September, we are calling for real  GDP abroad on average to expand at about 3 percent in the current quarter, fo llowing growth at that pace in the third quarter, and to accelerate a bit in 2006 and 2007.  This favorable picture incorporates a return to steady expansi on in Japan and solid, albeit slightly moderating, growth in the emerging Asian region.  In addition, real growth in Mexico should recover from a disappointi ng outcome during the first half of this year. Our judgment that the pace of foreign economic activity remains firm is reflected in a range of positive indicators in Canada, including employment, industrial production, monthly GDP, a rebound in manufacturing orders in Japan =s Tankan business conditions index moved up again in September, with pr ojections of capital spending this year and forecasts of sales and profits all revi sed up.  Indicators for the euro area are             18 of 114mixed, but in Germany industrial orders ha ve come in strong and the October Ifo measure of business climate jumped to  a five-year peak.  Among the emerging-and retail sales growth remained above 12 pe rcent.  Korean real GDP growth rose to 7.5 percent in the third quarter, and Br azil continues to enj oy very strong export sales. The mix of sustained global growth and upward shifts in commodity prices, particularly crude oil prices, naturally heightens con cerns about higher consumer price inflation. Headline in flation rates abroad have moved up significantly with the rise in crude oil prices. Our outlook, however, is for these prices to decelerate over the forecast period given our projection (and that of the futures markets) that crude oil prices will be about flat next  year and edge down in 2007 and given that the effects of previous increases in crude prices on inflation will wane and then end. Such an outcome depends upon an absence of signi ficant second-round effects of oil prices on domestic prices a nd wages abroad.  To date, core inflation in the major foreign countries confirms this is the case. The combination of continued growth  and contained inflation pressures sounds optimistic.  Rest assured, we have found numerous risks about which to worry. The elevated energy prices could sap consumer demand more than we expect, undermining the pace of real growt h.  In the face of higher costs, business spending on new capital could falter, part icularly in emerging Asia where few countries have petroleum production sector s.  Wage demands could react to the increase in headline inflati on and threaten to ignite a set of second- and third-round effects. We do not see evidence of these developments  at this time, but it is too soon to conclude that the da nger of such ac tions has passed. A second feature of the inte rnational forecast that mer its a few minutes is the approximately neutral contribution of real net exports to U.S. real GDP growth in the third quarter, following a positive c ontribution in the second quarter.  The third-quarter NIPA [national income a nd product accounts] data released last Friday imply a slightly smaller, less positive, contribution than we had incorporated in the Greenbook baseline forecast or in the September forecast.  However, in the current quarter, compared  with the September forecast, we are assuming a greater rebound in exports a nd have reduced our assessment of the extent to which the external sector will provide a drag on GDP growth.  Accordingly, we expect that on a four-qua rter change basis, the external sector will record a slightly positive contribution to U.S. real GDP growth for the year— the first annual positive contribution si nce 1995.  However, we are not ready to drag on U.S. growth from the external sect or in the current quarter and on balance over the forecast period. On a quarterly basis, both imports and exports are highly variable.  Seasonally adjusted real oil imports impart notab le quarter-to-quarter variance to real            19 of 114imports.  But recently we have experienced weakness in other components of real imports.  During this intermeeting period, imports again surprised us on the downside, with August data for nominal imports much weaker than expected.  This negative surprise included both goods and services, and within goods, it was particularly the case for imports of consum er goods and industrial supplies.  For the near-term forecast we have included so me effects as a result of the hurricanes and the disruption to general trade they caused.  As a result, there is some implicit payback in the forecast for real imports in the fourth quarter.  Nevertheless, compared with the September Greenbook, we  have lowered the growth of real imports in 2006 and 2007 in response to the somewhat softer outlook for U.S. activity and to a higher path for import prices. Growth of third-quarter real exports was also revised down, although not by enough to offset weaker imports. Hurricane effects also figure in our estimate for third-quarter exports. More significant has been the recent strike at Boeing.  We judge that the strike had a mo re pronounced impact on September= s exports than we previously thought, leading us to weaken  real exports for la st quarter.  But the rapid conclusion of that strike also led us to strengthen real e xports for the current quarter. For 2006 and 2007, we expect export growth will average a bit above 5 percent per year, consistent with our outlook for steady real output growth abroad. In sum, actual trade data through August,  our estimates of how the turbulent weather of recent months has affected exports and imports, and our projections of global primary commodity prices, particularly crude oil, combine to imply unusual quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in gr owth of real exports and real imports.  Some of these developments have surprised us since the September Greenbook.  Going forward, however, we expect that th e transitory weather effects will fade by early 2006. We look for real exports a nd imports to expand at similar rates on balance in 2006 and 2007. With imports s ubstantially greater than exports, this outcome implies a negative contribution from the external sector of about ⅓ percentage point each year. David and I will be happy to take your questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Are any commentators  looking at the move ment of the real trade deficit and raising the issue of J-curv e possibilities? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Well, that’s always present for a time. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I’ve seen al most none of it.  That’s all. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. But for ex ample, our J-curve effects last fo r two or three qua rters after the exchange rate changes.  People look for this in particular when the dollar is coming down, and the           20 of 114dollar decline ended la st December, roug hly.  So I would say there is presently very little J-curve in the pipeline. There may be  a little bit from the dollar’s rise, but the dollar hasn’t risen so very much. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. But this downturn is somewhat unusual. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. In nominal imports, but it’s so rt of going the wrong way.  You might say it’s the effect of six months of slight dollar depreciation; it could be.  But oddly, import prices have been higher than an ybody was expecting.  So pieces just do n’t fit for the J-curv e.  And I think the effect of the dollar depreciation that occurred through the end of  2004 has largely gone away. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It is the import price data which really undercut it. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Yes. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER. Dave, I wo uld like to ask a little more about the Greenbook  baseline.  First, tell me more by way of characteriz ing the path of inflation expect ations.  And seco nd, characterize the forces and the relative  weights that bring core inflation do wn in the second half for next year. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Certainly.  Basically, em bedded in this forecast is some implicit deterioration in inflation expectat ions or underlying inflation mo mentum on the order of about ½ percentage point from the end of 2003 into 2006.  We think we need some of that to explain the pickup in actual core inflation th at we’ve had, which has been a deterioration of about a percentage point.  Some of that follows from the fact that higher h eadline inflation probably has fed back a bit into inflation expectations , so we think there has been some slight deterioration there on net.  With energy prices flattening out and then turning down, we have some very low headline inflation numbers coming soon; th at will start to appear ar ound the turn of the year.  So we think some of the pickup that has occurred is likely to unwind, first, as the indir ect effects of the higher energy prices—which we think will  still be a small plus ea rly next year—start to wash out by later next             21 of 114year. As headline inflation comes down, that w ill reduce somewhat un derlying inflation momentum, and we have inflation expectations movi ng back down into 200 6.  It’s a pretty small move. The deceleration we’re projecting in 2007 from 2¼ percent to 2 percent reflects mostly the indirect effects of energy prices and some slowdown  in import prices.  But we would think that that inflation expectations process, whic h we have built into this forecast and which is relatively minor, would begin to unwind late r in the forecast period. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  How much of the acceleration that you describe in inflation expectations occurs from here out?  You talked about a certain amount from ’03 to now. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. A couple of tent hs.  One of the reasons for ra ising this issue is that it remains a matter of considerable uncertainty on our part.  And I think a good case could be made that we haven’t really se en much sign yet of any underlying inflation being built into the labor cost side especially.  That’s still just  a part of our forecast .  The pickup we’re proj ecting in compensation costs is, in part, a feed-through of higher headline inflation.  It’s also, in part, a feed-through of better productivity finding its way even tually into real wages.  But we haven’t really seen it yet.  So I think a case could be made that even the small amoun t that we have built in could be overdoing it.  And that’s one of the re asons we wanted an alte rnative simulation in th e Greenbook in which we showed you what would happen  if we’re wrong about that. Obviously, on the other side, it’s hard to know whether or not yo ur actions and your statements perhaps have been the key factors keepin g overall inflation expectations relatively well contained.  Your actions and communications about policy intentions may have, in essence, conditioned both the wage- and price-setting environment in which wo rkers and firms currently find themselves.         22 of 114On the other side of our foreca st, if you were to stop tighten ing soon and co mmunicate that basically the inflation situation wa sn’t a problem, there is some risk  that observers would interpret that to mean you would be  more likely to acquiesce to higher inflation goin g forward.  And that could feed through to expectations .  So we also showed a simula tion in which things deteriorate more noticeably on our funds  rate assumption than we built into the baseline.   As I said, I feel that we’ve ba lanced the risks.  As I looked  ahead and asked myself if no change in inflation expectations going forward would be a bala nced forecast—meaning, “is it just as likely that they’ll be going down as  going up over the next year?”—I  didn’t think that scenario, in fact, had balanced risks.  So we felt comfortable building in a little more upside  on the thought that that would probably better balance the risks give n the inflation pressures that are currently confronting firms and workers. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. David, I had a qu estion for you about the forecast that activity is going to slow in the second half of ’06 and ’07.  You talked about the reasons for th e slowdown, which were tighter monetary policy, a slowing in house price apprecia tion, and diminishing fi scal stimulus.  In the Monday morning briefing, yo u threw in the stock market  as well—waning impetus from household wealth in terms of both  the stock market and the hous ing components.  I thought the Greenbook had an assumption of 6 percent growth in the stock mark et per year.  I wonder if you could talk about that. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. It does, indeed.  In essence, what is going on with the stock market is that we’ve had a net stimulus in the eco nomy this year coming from the run-up in the stock market that occurred last year; so there are lagg ed effects of that earlier increase  on spending.  Going forward it           23 of 114goes from a net stimulus to more of a neutral effect because we’ve made basically a neutral assumption about the stoc k market going forward. That contrasts with  the housing market , where we think we’re gettin g a lot of net stimulus right now. But in our fo recast of a slowdown to 4 percent, that moves towa rd neutrality, and then the 2 percent rise in hous e prices that we’r e forecasting for 2007  actually would im pose a little bit of restraint on overall spending at that point. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. So when you look at those two factors,  which is more important? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. This is  probably putting far t oo fine a point on it, but they’re both about equal in the forecast in terms of their overall e ffects—in terms of the un derlying thrust or the underlying restraint that is bein g put on growth going forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I’d like to renew a plea that I’ve made a couple of times over the ye ars.  I think everybody in this room believes that a vigorously competitive in ternational sector is good for growth and, therefore,  I bristle when you talk ab out that in terms of a drag  on growth and a negative contribution to GDP. You’re talk ing about an arithmetic way of adding up the GDP account.  But what’s happening is that vigorous growth in demand is being par tially met from abroad, and that’s not necessarily bad for growth.  So I bristle when I hear it put this way because so me of this ends up filtering into our p ublic discourse.  And even  though we may understand that we’re talking about the arithmetic statement of the GDP account, it seems misleadi ng.  So I want to mention that. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I take your point. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Secondly, and this goes in part to the questio n President Moskow asked, we have somewhat of a mixed situation in terms of the forecast.  When I first came in 1998, there was a staff forecast of the stock market.  In fact, I remember that at the ti me the stock market was forecast           24 of 114to go down, and many asp ects of the Greenbook for ecast were predicated on  a decline in the stock Now we have, I think, an appropriate standard ty pe of assumption here.  The stock market is forecast on a sort of equilibriu m basis, and we’re not independently  trying to have a stock market forecast. We do the same thing on oil prices.  But we don’t do that on some other important parts of the forecast, such as exchange rates and the federal funds rate. To me, the most useful baseline forecast w ould be to put together  the Greenbook on a consistent set of assumpti ons on those kinds of things.  Then I’d value the staff input as to where they believe the federal funds ra te, the exchange rate, and everyt hing else will likely come out differently from the expectation in  the market.  But to me we have a somewhat  muddled situation in terms of the internal consistency here.  Dave Stockton and I have talked about this several times over the years, but maybe there could be a survey  of the Committee on what we would find most useful as the assumptions for thin gs like exchange rates,  the stock market, oil prices—all of those things where there are market fore casts available.  What would be the most useful to the Committee in terms of the baseline a ssumption for th e Greenbook? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I’m sure Vincent would be prepared to organize a survey  and would respect the Committee’s wishes. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I don’t know whethe r I’m the only one wh o would find that us eful.  But at any rate, I offer th at proposal. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Let me make one po int, if I may.  We have wr estled with the notion of what constitutes a neutral assumption about the exchange rate, and it is not obvious be cause we know that the forward rates implied by interest  rate differentials are very, ve ry poor forecasters.  Everybody knows that.  So, taking that as an assumption an d giving it weight—and having it run through the              25 of 114forecast—does not seem attractive to us.  But the altern ative is an approach  that is kind of “consistent with the other pieces of  the forecast and neutral.”  It’s a tough call.  We have clung to something that is close to, but not exactly, the ran dom walk version of things for a while now.  We certainly don’t see our exch ange rate forecast as having a determ ining effect such that we’re driving the forecast by making this assump tion.  We try not to do that. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. But I think you c ould set up whatever standard  you believe would be most useful and stick to it consistently over time an d then explain how your vi ews may differ from the standard assumption that you use.  That’s mo re or less what you do with a number of things.  And I emphasize the stock market as a very important example because of  the influence of wealth on consumption. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. On the house price front, obviously, there aren’t market signals.  But we’ve confronted the very same problem of trying to forecast an asset price that we don’t have enormous confidence in.  So the approach that we have taken is  that we presented a few models at the special briefing last  July—some models that rely more on  the momentum in underlying house prices and other models that take seriously some sort of error correctio n to a rent-price ratio to bring that ratio back into equilibr ium.  And our forecast is a mi x of those various approaches. I guess I’d plead guilty  in the sense that our ho use price forecast, along with our rent forecast, does imply by the end of the proj ection horizon a little of what we view as the current over-valuation diminishing.  Bu t mostly that forecast is fairly neut ral in that our assessment of over-valuation pretty much involves pric es holding at that higher level going forward.  It gets a little worse in the near term an d then gets a little better a bit further out.  But it is an elem ent of the forecast that obviously is im portant and about which there is considerable uncertainty. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher.                26 of 114MR. FISHER.  Karen, I didn’t bristle, but my ears pricked up  when you mentioned Mexico.  This is not a major point, but well before the hurricanes we no ticed a disconnect between the standard presumed correlation of, say, 90 percen t—Mexican GDP to U.S. industrial production.  Something has weakened in Mexico .  We’re analyzing it.  It coul d be the onset of the sexennial event, the presidential election.  But, for example,  our El Paso folks report that with the Delphi announcement some 60,000 Mexican maquiladora  workers have been affected.  And your comments on Mexican economic gr owth or your assumptions seem to be somewhat different than what we’re hearing anecdota lly and what we’re finding in our research in Dalla s.  I just wanted to point that out and offer our input.   If we can be of assistance there, we’d be glad to do so. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Okay. We appreci ate that.  I recognize that th e outcome in Mexico during the first half of this year certainly raises ques tions, because Mexico has not enjoyed the level of production that would have been co nsistent with previous relationshi ps to U.S. GDP.  So whether or not Mexico will, in fact, strengthen is certainly a risk in the forecast. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.  I’d lik e to talk a little bit to  the point Bill made, especially if we’re going to do a survey of Comm ittee members.  I like the way we’re getting the forecast now. The staff has a vi ew of forces of aggr egate demand, potential supply, and inflation pressures, and they take that view and fold in some course of Federal Reserve policy that will produce an outcome that we  see in the Greenbook.  And in some  cases, for some types of prices, they think they can’t do any better  than the market so they just put in the market forecast.  Other prices, like bond yields, etc., are endogenous; stock prices ar e endogenous to the process. If we ask the staff to put together a forecast that had their view of  demand and supply and inflation pressures, together with  market prices—which may be built on a diffe rent view of supply              27 of 114and demand and market pri ces—I’m not sure what we ’d get in the end.  We ’d get an outcome that could look very strange from time to time when their view and the ma rket’s view differ.  And then we would want to know what we would have to do in order to pr oduce something that looked more sensible.   Right now, we have your  fed funds forecast in there.  If we went the other way, I would ask for another forecast that incorporated how the staf f thought market prices w ould evolve.  There’s no perfect way of doing this.  But I’m a little more comfor table with the way it is done now than I would be in the other case. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. If I could respond very quickly, something is going to look very strange one way or the other when the views are very different.   And what can look strange now is a course of long-term interest rates th at is not what’s in the market.  So something is going to  look strange one way or the other.  The question is : What is the best way to convey  the staff’s view about where the world is going?  What is th e clearest way and what is most useful for the Committee? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Yes.  On this poin t, what President Poole is sugges ting is well posed.  It’s a forecast conditioned on rep licating sort of an arb itrage-free set of observabl e financial asset prices going forward.  I don’t want it, th ough, because I want a mixture of the information that is conveyed by the market and the staff’s judgment.  I want a co mbination of that.  The approach you suggest is a useful exercise to ponder.  But as long as the st aff is clear about how thei r assumptions differ from those embodied in market prices, I’d rather see a combination, personally. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  David, have you learne d anything more in the last 24 hours on the issue of the mi ss on producers’ durable equipment?           28 of 114MR. STOCKTON. We haven’t l earned any more.  We are not inclined to di scount that figure.  We saw nothing in the details to suggest that  that would be appropriate.  It looks to us like a translation miss between the BEA’s more detailed construction of the figures out of the orders and shipments figures and some deflation issues.  I think at this point we probably would be  closer to 3.6 than to 3.8. Karen’s pe ople think they would be inclined to be just a little lower than the BEA’s current estimate, and we would as we ll.  We learned a bit about defla tion on the reside ntial side that would suggest we’d probably be a little lower than the BEA.  But all of that is small potatoes.  The basic story is that it s till looks to us to have been strong er than we were ex pecting and probably suggests a little more unde rlying strength than was implicit in our forecast fo r the second half of the year. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  All right.  Are there any further questions for our colleagues? If not, would somebody like to  start?  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  The Seventh Distri ct economy expanded at a somewhat better pace since the last meeting, though it is st ill lagging the rest of the country.  However, for the Chicago economy, particularly th e South Side [laughter], it was the best October in 88 years! President Fi sher and I had a side wager,  but I’ll let him fill you in  on the details of that. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  I lost. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. In our contact calls  for this round, energy prices  were a pervas ive concern.  So far they’ve had a limited effect  on consumer spending, but our contacts worry that high heating bills will take a bigger bite out of sales in the coming mo nths.  In contrast, we ’re seeing the impact on costs right now. Nearly every contact reported pressures from higher energy prices.  There are many examples, but here’s one that seemed a bit more surprising than others.  A large specialty retailer noted that the wholesale co st of furniture had in creased due to higher prices for polyfoam,             29 of 114which is a petroleum derivative.  He  said that in 30 years in the furniture busine ss, this is the first time that the stuffing cost  more than the fabric or  the frame.  [Laughter] Labor markets are also starting to generate cost  pressures.  For exampl e, both Manpower and Kelly report signs of tighter labor markets.  Thes e contacts say that many firms, after having been very cautious about hiring, now feel  they have pushed productivity gr owth as far as it can go and, accordingly, finally feel th ey need to hire more permanent employees, part icularly in office jobs.  Our contacts see this as a furthe r sign that firms are more confident about demand.  One of the staffing services firms said that they are paying higher wages and also spen ding more on recruiting and retention bonuses.  And seve ral of our directors report that they’re budgeting larger salary increases for 2006, in the range of one-half to a full percen tage point higher than this year. The consensus among our contacts  was that only a portion of these higher costs has been passed through to prices, at least so far.  Several reported that labor costs are mostly eating into goods retailer noted that they had set their current li st prices last spring.  When they decide how to price their products for next year, they’ll take in to account the fuel cost  outlook at that time. There has been no let-up in the auto industry’s woes.  Our contacts say that higher oil prices seem to have frozen consumers, and showroom traffic is down.  Th ere have been some interesting developments with regard to  labor costs in the auto industry.  GM’s recent re negotiation of its health care liabilities, if ratified, would be the UAW’s [United Auto Workers] fi rst major mid-contract give-back in history. Ford and DaimlerChr ysler will be demanding simila r concessions.  Indeed, it might be that the Delphi bankruptcy has helped th e industry at least get the ball rolling on some meaningful restructuring of labor contracts.  However, these are ve ry contentious issues, and there’s            30 of 114a clear possibility of a strike at Delphi that c ould seriously disrupt  the auto indust ry, particularly General Motors. For the national outlook, the last six weeks of da ta have confirmed that the dislocations from Katrina and Rita have had a li mited impact on aggregate econom ic activity.  Ou tside the areas affected by the hurricanes, labor ma rkets are improving at a pace simi lar to earlier in the year.  And I’m getting favorable impressions of business sent iment from my cont acts, which is a good sign for hiring and capital spending.  Howeve r, there is a risk that the recent sluggishness in consumer expenditures and low levels  of confidence may be foreshadow ing a period of somewhat softer growth in consumption.  Households have further run down sa vings to maintain spending in the face of higher energy prices, and it’s very difficult to gauge how this might influence consumption going forward. With regard to inflation, the readings on core prices in the last quarte r were good.  Given all that I’ve heard in recent weeks, though, it seems likely that past increase s in energy and material costs will soon begin to show through more clearly in prices downstream, as is forecast in the Greenbook.  Furthermore, labor markets have tightened .  As I noted, many of  my business contacts are planning for larger increases in wages and benefits next year.  Th ey can only abso rb these higher costs in margins for so long.  Finall y, there’s a chance that increases in costs and prices  will result in a meaningful rise in longer-run inflation expectations, which w ould be a risk to the longer-run Greenbook forecast.   All of these risks add up to incr easing the funds rate by 25 basis points ag ain today.  Looking ahead, I think we should continue tightening.  At le ast we are comfortably in the middle of a neutral range, and there’s a po ssibility we’re going  to have to go furt her.  There’s a good deal of uncertainty about how to quantify th e equilibrium funds rate and the degree of polic y accommodation.  The              31 of 114Bluebook suggests that a 4 percent nominal funds rate might be the midpoint of the range, but I’m personally skeptical th at the rate is that low.  This is going to be an important issue for us to consider going forward.  I’m glad that we at leas t started the discussion ea rlier today, and I hope we’ll continue it later in the meeting.

MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, gr owth in the Eleventh Distri ct, if anything, has been accelerating in recent months —picking up steam.  We appear to be the beneficiary of the natural disasters that have taken place on the Gulf Coast, and that continued, incide ntally, through Wilma. A small example is that the grapef ruit growers have definitely benefited from the destruction of grapefruit crops in Florida, which was nearly total.  If I were to paraphrase Yogi Berra, who said the future isn’t what it used to be, I think I would be on the ma rk because we’re now much more confident. One of the most articulat e, smartest, and at the same time conservative, bankers in our District, Dick Evans of Cullen/Frost, says that building contacts are reporting the busiest business activity in 30 or 40 years in our state.  At the very front end,  which is site work for land development, one of his clients, an engineer, reported that in his entire business career he’s  never been busier.  So we are proceeding on all pistons, and we’re beginning to see it reflected particularly in real estate prices.  The market has gone from a buyer’s market to a seller’s market almost overnight.  In the Gulf area of Padre Island, for example, record pri ces are now suddenly appearing overnight. So in summary, the bankers and the business community in the El eventh District, as I reported at the last session, are still fris ky, Mr. Chairman.  Indeed, their ta ils are wagging at an accelerated pace and I hope—to paraphrase another “Berra-ism,” which is that history isn’t what it used to be—             32 of 114that history doesn’t repeat itself here.  But we cer tainly have a much more  enthusiastic business community. I want to turn now to a broader perspective, based on our calls to headquarters of companies that operate throughout the nation as well as in our District.  At the last FOMC meeting, Mr. Chairman, you mentioned gasoline prices having a very visible impact as one of the few commodities that consumers lo ok at for price comparison s.  In talking to our retailers, that is clearly the case. In sharing with Presid ent Poole our contacts with Wal-Ma rt, I talked to the new CEO of U.S. Wal-Mart yesterday, and he noted that while Octobe r same-store sales were  up 4.2 percent, the consumption pattern had sh ifted.  Because of gasoline prices, people are making fe wer trips to the stores but they’re buying larger amounts. And we have a leading indicator ourselves in Harvey Rosenblum,  who is the wine connoisseur amongst our research leaders in Dalla s.  I’ve noticed that he, since he  lives in a dry district of Dallas —we still have prohibition in parts of Texas—is making less frequent trips to the wi ne store but is buying in greater volume.  Perhaps that’s because of the questions we’re asking him!  [Laughter] Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven, and Dollar General all repor t that heavier items transported by truck— dog food and bottled water are just two examples—are under trem endous price pressure due to rising fuel costs. And these higher prices are being passed on, although sometimes offset by consumers substituting pr ivate label items for brand name produc ts.  American Airlines is passing on their fuel costs.  They managed to raise their average fare 8 percent in the third quarter.  Once again we hear them talking about $25 attachments to confir mation fees for st andby passengers.  Hovnanian and Centex, two of the largest builders, report rising costs of locally sourced materials delivered by truck, adding to price pressures of  labor and materials fo r roofing, siding, and windows.  We’re seeing fuel prices affect also the transportation costs that are charged and passed               33 of 114on by the express companies. UPS reports—and I don’t think this  is public in formation—that they’re targeting rate increases, pre-fuel charge, of 4 percent to be  set in early November, knowing that the U.S. Postal Serv ice will be pricing in  an increase of 5 percent pl us at the beginning of the new year. There are some potential mitiga ting factors here.  7-Eleven, Exxon, Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club stores, and other gas retailers repo rt that the margin they are reta ining on their ga s sales—and 53 percent of 7-Eleven’s revenue come s from gasoline sa les now—is still running 30  cents versus 13 to 14 cents normally. They ex pect to hold these margins as long as they can, or at least until volatility is dampened; but as gas prices ease, this could poss ibly be a cushion that will provide some relief for retailers. And the co rrelation is quite direct.  At 7-Elev en, for example, th ey can walk you through, week by week, the effect  on sales of each downward move ment in the price of gasoline. Three weeks ago they had an increase in sales volume of 2 pe rcent; two weeks ago, 4 percent; and this last week, 6 percent. So we  may have a little bit of  relief coming from th e reduction of margins that might occur as the margins go  from 30 to 13 to 14 cents. It’s still clear from our discussi ons with business oper ators that price pres sures are building.  A rising percentage of companies are experiencing price increases for what they sell as well as for what they buy, along the lines th at President Moskow mentioned.  We see it particularly in chemicals, as he mentioned.  Caus tic soda, formerly priced at $450 a dry ton, is now $800 a dry ton.  Polyethylene, formerly priced at 38 cents a pound, is now priced at 55 cents a pound.   I hope this is expunged later, but Exxon’s CEO told me that they will take every measure they can to pass through, and I quote, “siz able increases” on that front in every place that they can.  Perhaps the best indicator of what’s happening in  the chemical industry  is Pioneer Core Alkaline Company, which was filing for bankruptcy and is now “printing money,” according to their CEO.  Wal-Mart expects            34 of 114to pass along price increases for all resin-based pr oducts, such as garden ch airs and outdoor tables, in the spring.  The rails appear to  be planning, according to BNSF’s CEO, a price increase of 5 to 6 percent before fuel su rcharges next year. And of interest in all of our discussions is that we’re hearing what  President Moskow is hearing, which is that there are pressures on the wage front.  To  be sure, they are mitigated by Delphi, Northwest Airlines, and also GM.  But th e numbers we’re hearing fr om the rails, from the Belo Corporation, a large broadcas ter, and others on labor prices are negotiation targets of about 3 percent, with a heavy focus on health care runni ng in the 9 to 10  percent range. I think probably the best summ ary, Mr. Chairman, came from the CEO of Wal-Mart U.S.  He said that “previously we were deflating and we can still offset a little bit thro ugh China, although to a lesser degree than before.”  He said “we will early-discount like all retailers, moving our discount season, largely in terms of announ cements, up to November 1.  Bu t at best we ho pe to ‘hold the line’ on prices.”  That’s a direct quote. So I feel that the heightened in flationary pressures that we talked about last time are lurking.  Against that background, I fa vor further tightening to cont ain inflationary impulses and expectations.  I have some comments on the statem ent, but we can speak a bout that later.  The bottom line is that one can sense, even though we don’t see it in the data, inflation pressures creeping up like little cat’s feet.  Thank you.

MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At our last meet ing I was optimistic that we would avoid a brush with stagflatio n despite the higher energy prices  and the setback in production from Katrina.  Developments du ring the intermediate period have generally reinforced my             35 of 114optimistic view.  Although consider able uncertainty still clouds the outlook, I re gard reports on both real economic activity and inflation to be generally encouraging. On the real side, it now appears more likely that the disruptions caused by the hurricanes will be transitory.  Oil and wholesale gasoline prices, for example, have fallen below their August levels before Katrina.  Furthermore, rebuilding has been gathering stea m quickly, and spending outside of the Gulf region remains robust.  In  the Greenbook, the effect of this encouraging news about the underlying vigor of the economy ha s been held in check by the assumption of tighter financial conditions, so the path fo r GDP is littl e revised. With respect to the prospects for inflation, I remain more  optimistic than  the baseline Greenbook projection.  Da vid suggested in his remarks that it was possible to make a case for inflation doing better than the Gr eenbook projection, and I will purs ue that case now.  Certainly, the latest data have been favorable.  Over the six mo nths ending in September, the core CPI increased only 1.3 percent at an annual rate , while the core PCE pr ice index was up 1.5 pe rcent.  These data raise the question: Where is the en ergy price pass-through?  PCE ener gy prices have been rising at double digit rates for more than a y ear, but they have left remarkably little imprint on core inflation. At our last meeting, I descri bed some econometric evidence showing that since the early 1980s, changes in real oil prices have not had an appreciable effect  on core inflation.  Today I thought I would cite some reports from our business contacts that app ear to be generally in line with this result. They do not e that there has been some  success in passing energy  cost increases down the supply chain but, given competitive pressures and th e lack of pricing power, they tell us that the buck usually stops before the consumer. I thought I would give you an  example inspired by the seas on.  A large pumpkin grower/ processor [laughter] near Portland has seen a 20  percent jump in the pr ice of plastic packaging             36 of 114materials.  She reports that she can  pass these costs on to the small retailers she serves, but they are not able to charge consumers more for retail pumpki n products.  So this Thanksgiving you need not worry about paying more for your pumpkin pies.  Obviously, fo recasting beyond that is hazardous, but looking out toward Ch ristmas, I thought I would note that one of the country’ s largest growers of poinsettias is on  our Advisory Council, an d he is highly confident th at there will be little pass-through of energy cost s into retail poinsetti a prices.  [Laughter] Also in contrast to the Greenbo ok, I see no significant pressu re for higher inflation coming from increased inflation expectations.  In partic ular, despite the surge in energy costs this year, current estimates of inflation compensation, both ov er the next five years and the subsequent five-year period, remain at the same average level that prevailed during the first half of this year.  A further sign that inflation expectations remain we ll contained can be found in the continued subdued growth of wages and salaries.  Last Friday’s reading on the ECI [Employment Cost Index] I thought revealed no evidence of any pass-through of higher headline inflation or higher inflation expectations to labor comp ensation.  So I see no in dication of the ’70s style wage-price spiral in the offing. Overall, I judge our credibility to be very much in tact.  Of course, our credibility going forward does depend on continued vigilance.  The economy now appear s to be close to full employment, with a good deal of momentum.  And annual core inflat ion, at least as judged by the core PCE measure, re mains near the upper end of  my comfort zone and, ar guably, inflation risks are tilted somewhat to the upside.   So with respect to policy, I support at a mi nimum the removal of any remaining policy accommod ation.  The Bluebook s hows that the funds rate has finally entered a broad zone of plausible neutral rates, but under the circumstance s, I personally would be more        37 of 114comfortable with a policy position toward the center of this  zone.  So a few more increases, including one today, seem to  me likely to be required. In implementing mone tary policy, it seems to me that actions matter, but so do wo rds, and I wanted to briefly open up the question of the stat ement.  I think for today the words of alternative B should suffice, but Vincent has repeatedly suggested, and a numb er of you have emphasized, that we need to consider how to modify the statement language.  Several elements of this statement have expiration dates that are quickly appr oaching.  So I think it’s an importa nt issue for us to discuss.   As we go forward, I see three problems with using the kind of la nguage that is in alternative B. First, it refers to policy a ccommodation, which will arguably soon be ex hausted.  Second, it refers to a “measured pace, ” when at some point pr esumably we will reach a stopping point in this tightening cycle.  And, third, it now contains a near-tautological ba lance of risk st atement that I think serves no obvious policy purpos e.  Of course, these three problems could be fixed at different meetings.  For example, if the inflation picture sours, the “measured pace” language could continue to be used well past th e elimination of the policy accommodat ion phrase.  As Governor Gramlich feared, the balance of risk statements  could outlive us all!  [Laughter] Still, trying to fix all of these three problems at once has some appe al, and I thought that alternative C did just that .  It eliminates the balance of risk  statement and the policy accommodation language; and it substitutes a new forward-lo oking policy statement fo r the “measured pace” phrasing. My main criticis m of alternative C is that it jettisons any mention of the conditionality of our actions on future data, and I believe such conditionality is always worth highlighting and particularly deserving of emphasis now, toward the en d of our tightening cycle. I believe that a good model for future statements would have three sections: a policy decision, a descriptive rationale, and a bit of forward-looking policy guidance.  The policy guidance should            38 of 114be nuanced—tailored to prevaili ng circumstances and explicitly conditional— and it should not include a formulaic balance of risk  statement.  Let me give a concrete example base d on alternative C. If the Committee believes, for example, that further tightening remains necessary once policy is no longer accommodative, it could state, follow ing the rationale sectio n, that “under these conditions the Committee  perceives that further poli cy firming is likely to be  necessary,” or “will be necessary,” or “might be necessary.”  “Nonethele ss, the Committee will res pond to any changes in economic prospects to fulfill  its obligation to mainta in price stability and fost er sustainable growth.” Once the Committee feels that furt her tightening is not necessary, it could state that “under these conditions the Comm ittee perceives that the current stan ce of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate going forward.  Nonetheless,  the Committee will respond to any changes in economic prospects, and so forth, to fulfill its obliga tions.”  In any case, I h ope that this proposal might be useful in jump-starting our discussion of these issues.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker.

MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent  data confirm that economic activity was growing at a solid pace pre-Katrina,  and we appear to have remained on track since then, at least on an ex-hurricane basis.  The direct effects of the storms appear to be limi ted to the disruption of productive capacity along the Gulf Coast.  Outside of the affected re gions, real activity continues to expand, as suggested by the Se ptember industrial production report and the th ird-quarter GDP figures. In our District, there are few si gns that this year’s hurricanes have directly affected real economic activity. In fa ct, we’ve seen a broad pickup in act ivity since August.  Our October manufacturing survey indicates that shipments,  orders, and employment grew at or above the previous month’s pace.  Services firms also reported strengthening revenue growth in both             39 of 114September and October, and reta il sales increased moderately in both months, as broad sales increases outweighed a drop in auto and light truck sales. Concerns about the macroeconomic effects of  these hurricanes obvio usly center on the significant bulge in energy prices.  The continue d growth in nominal consumer spending ex-autos since Katrina is evidence that th e effects of energy pr ice increases have not yet dampened household demand, and there seems to be little indication of a hurrican e-induced downshift in investment demand either.  So the ev idence is consistent with my hypothesi s that the hurricanes are essentially a supply disruption with l ittle independent effect on  demand, and thus, the real interest rate path should be, if anythi ng, higher than it otherwise would be. A second concern regarding the macroeconomic ef fects of the hurricanes is the potential for energy prices to pass through to core inflation.  Here the recent news on core prices has been encouraging.  Core PCE inflation came in at 1.3 percent for the third quar ter and has averaged 1.5 percent since March, right where I think we would li ke it to be.  One would expect most of the pass-through to take a couple of mont hs to materialize, however, and in that regard there are several unsettling signs wort h noting.  Within the Fifth District, fo r example, our survey s show a surge in prices paid for both manufacturing and services ov er the last two months.  Moreover, the average reported rate of increase in prices received in both surveys has acce lerated significantly in Consistent with these quantitati ve signals, a larger number of  our contacts now say they’re able to pass through part or all of their increasing costs to their customers.  In addition, the average rate of price increase our respondents see for six months ahead ha s also surged, an d our index for expected wage increases in  manufacturing has skyrocketed to over 56 for Oc tober.  This diffusion index has a midpoint of zero, and it had been aver aging below 30 recently.  So a reading of 56 is              40 of 114consistent with the antici pation of a fairly broad- based upswing in inflatio n, although obviously it could just be a false alarm. Another unsettling sign is the recent behavior of TIPS inflation comp ensation measures.  These have drifted up a couple of tenths si nce June and are now bo uncing around in the neighborhood of 2.6. So I think we were right to downgrade inflation expectations from “well contained” to merely “contained” in our last statem ent, and I think we should  view a further erosion of inflation expectations as unwelcome. The extent to which energy price increases pass  through to core infl ation is fundamentally determined by the public’s expectations regarding fu ture monetary policy.  My sense is that we have just a brief window to head off such pass-throug h should it threaten.  Th e Greenbook does foresee significant pass-through, with the co re PCE inflation rising to 2.4 pe rcent in the first half of next year and then gradually fa lling back down to under 2 percent.  Inflation expect ations appear to trace out a similar hump-shaped path.  In  the face of this outcome, the Greenbook has us raising the funds rate to 4¼ percent in December an d then stopping there for a year, at least ¼ point short of where I would question the plausibility of this joint outcom e.  First, I do not think we would or should stand by while inflation pros pects erode as noticeably as they do in the Greenbook.  Nor do I think we could count on inflatio n expectations to gently drift back down after surging as the Greenbook expects—at least not wit hout forceful actio n on our part. For today, I’m comfortabl e with the alternative B statement.  But should more definite signs of pass-through emerge in coming  months, we should be prepared  to communicate forcefully and convincingly our intention not to accommodate a de terioration in core infl ation of the magnitude portrayed in the Greenbook.                 41 of 114CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic condit ions in New England have bounced around a little bit over the last year or so.  Right now they  show a few sign s of flattening out.  Surveys of both consumer and business confidence show so me current strength, but opinions about activity six months from now either remain at a low level in the case of consumers or, for businesses, turned negative for the fi rst time in the la st five years. Worries about fuel and benefits costs, interest rate  increases, and the war in Iraq are most often mentioned by contacts  as shaping a less-than-rosy outlook.  And when you talk  to them about big profit margins, they look at you with a puzzled expression, w ondering what business you are talking about because that’s  certainly not the case for their busine ss.  I think there’s some difference of opinion when looking at y our own numbers versus the num bers in the aggregate. Anyway, for the present, most firms do report profits, with those serving the defense industry making notable headway.  Consumers are spending, if not on cars  then on housing, though at least according to one survey they perceive rising pressures on thei r personal finan ces.  And core inflation in the Boston area is surprisingly low rela tive to the nation.  It’s  usually higher.  Thus, there’s a sense in which the region  may be experiencing a period of  calm before a possible storm of negative trends. Employment in the region dropped in Septem ber, and the unemploym ent rate rose.  The employment decline was widespread by state and invo lved, in part, the usua l suspects of trade and manufacturing, but about half reflected governme nt workers in Maine.  September government employment can move around a lot, depending on the hiring of t eachers for kindergarten through 12th grade.  So it’s probably wise to take this drop in jobs with a grain of salt .  Many of our contacts           42 of 114report that skilled labor is hard to find and expensive.  Th ere are continui ng references to caution in hiring and a desire not to add a single new employee until  it’s necessary to do so. Both businesses and consumers are concerned about the impact of high heating oil, natural gas, and gasoline prices.  Local h eating oil companies that have provided lock-in rates for the winter in the past will not do so now, likely feeding into c oncerns.  Despite  many fervent prayers for the opposite, the winter is expected to be a bad one.  And that fo recast was underlined by the early snowfalls in northern New England a couple weeks ago and by the flurries in Massachusetts over the weekend. Certainly this is good in terms of prospects for sk iing revenues, but not so good for general optimism, given concerns about energy. Finally, let me say a word about residential real  estate markets.  The Boston area is often mentioned as having bubble-like ch aracteristics.  This is an obviou s concern, given the problems the region experienced with falling pr ices and related banking  failures in the ear ly ’90s.  However, there’s good reason to assume that  recent rising prices in New Engl and reflect a lack  of supply and an older, wealthier popu lation capable of supporting both a primary and a secondary residence, rather than a fundamentally unstabl e situation.  And some of the froth is fading.  Home prices continue to escalate but are currently increasing at about the same pace as in  the nation as a whole rather than leading it.  Four out of the eight other regions of the country are no w experiencing more rapid escalation. Contacts in the real estate industry report two trends.  First, there was a rather abrupt softening in the high-end suburban markets this summer, with  escalating supply and th e advent of a buyer’s multifamily units, particularly con dominiums, and a marked upturn in condo inventory.  Thus, most contacts think real estate markets appear to be returning to a more  reasonable place gradually, with             43 of 114much of the change at the high end.  This could feed  into some concerns about spending in the future and could certainly make people feel less wealthy.  But given where it  seems to be centered, it doesn’t appear likely to do  a lot of near-term damage. Turning to the national scene, in coming data appear to confir m the underlying strength of the U.S. economy. Separati ng out the impact of several hurri canes is not easy.  Readings on unemployment and business spending ne t of hurricane effects seem consistent with the continuation of solid growth through the remainder of 2005.  The strength of cons umer outlays remains a question, given the now 2-month downturn in co nfidence and the fact th at the outsized motor vehicle purchases that had supported such outlays in  the third quarter are fa lling off their highs.  However, labor market data seem consistent with continued strengt h in hiring.  One would suppose that, at least in the ne ar term, working consumers will be spending co nsumers, especially if confidence improves in the face of  waning energy prices—or at least prices for gasoline.  Finally, I take the continued st rength in housing as a sign that, under it  all, consumers still have the confidence to make rather long -term investments. Our forecast in Boston for the next year and into ’07 di ffers little from th e Greenbook’s.  Assuming energy prices subside,  or at a minimum that we don’ t have any new shocks, growth should pick up in the spri ng, as the impact of the energy tax on  consumers eases and as rebuilding in hurricane-ravaged areas accelerates.  Over the same 6-month or so pe riod through the winter into spring, low inventory levels are likely to be repl enished, feeding factory activity.  Growth outside the United States is, on balance, expected to be positive as well.  Employment growth should return to its pre-Katrina monthly pace, and the remaining slack  in the U.S. econom y should wane.  The post-Katrina “throw money at it” attitude in Washi ngton seems to have m oderated, but a fiscal stimulus of some size appears lik ely.  Our best guess on inflation mirrors th e Greenbook’s as well:         44 of 114The worrisome headline numbers on both the CPI and the PCE mode rate; the feed-through to core inflation ticks up but th en moderates through the year; and th is process pulls in on the upward trajectory of near-term inflation expectations. There are obvious risks here.  En ergy-based headline inflation could feed more strongly into the core, and inflation ex pectations could remain elevated.  We  could see the moderate trends in wage and salary growth, as measured by the ECI, be gin to take off.  Howe ver, I’m hopeful, along the same lines that Presid ent Yellen is, that inflation expectations  will moderate, as  gasoline prices have, and that we won’t see even as big a feed-through to the ECI da ta as the Greenbook projects.  However, if a big rise in wages were to occur, it would set red lights flashing on everybody’s economic dashboard. If we are lucky, our rather benign  forecast for the next year will work out.  If we’re not, we could be looking at both rising inflation and falling growth, as one of the alternative scenarios highlights.  In that regard, we need to pay careful attention to  incoming data on expectations, compensation, and core inflation.  If they’re blinking yellow or green, we may be on track.  If red predominates, the risks have  clearly escalated.   It certainly seems clear that ma naging such risks in the near term involves placing a premium on remaining credible regarding in flation.  Doing so should modera te price growth by tightening financial conditions and should resu lt in better pricing of risk.  It  should also convince consumers that inflation will not continue to exacerbate the growing strain on their po cketbooks.  It should moderate inflation expectations  and limit the feed-through in to wage and salary growth. But we also need to take care not to overdo.  There are downside risks.  With a small amount of additional tightening in the mi x, the Greenbook sees growth at below potential in  late ’06, a widening output gap in ’07, and a tick up in unemployment.  One ke y cause of this is a general             45 of 114slowing in real estate markets an d a decline in relative household we alth.  The related expected rise in personal saving may be just wh at the doctor ordered to start the process of reining in the excesses in the U.S. economy, but  I think we do ne ed to take care about dispen sing excessive amounts of inflation medicine.   In my view, we’re not at a tipping point as yet.  Our process of measured steps toward removing the remaining acco mmodation should continue  for a time, taking us  closer to the middle of the range of equilibrium rates.   But we should also begin to co nsider when we might have moved enough and how we might prepare markets for that.  In that regard, I was inte rested in the proposal that President Yellen had for an evol ution in our statement.  I think it’s going to take some time to absorb what she has reco mmended.  Maybe this me eting is not the meeting to make a change.  I’m probably comfortable with alterna tive B.  A couple of me etings ago, the Chairm an suggested that I take on the task—because I was opening my mouth at the time—of putting some propos als on the table, and I’ve been dragging my heels.  I’m more  than happy to work with  President Yellen on the direction she’s trying to take the statement.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me  first share some th oughts on recent economic developments in our Southeast region.  As you would expect, we ’ve continued to assess the regional and national implications of Hurricane Katrina, and now Hurricanes Rita and Wilma, which have added to our woes.  The recent employment statistics serve as a real-time barome ter of the hit our region has taken.  Across the states involv ed, through September our District has lost approximately 300,000 jobs from the storms.  Ironically, businesses in the affected areas trying to restart their operations are, in many cases, desperate to hire workers.  On a tr ip from the New Orleans Airport into            46 of 114downtown New Orleans, one sees help wanted signs on every corner.  The in ability to get evacuees from the area back into local housing has clearly slow ed the process of business  recovery.  In fact, if one thing related to the storms now stands out, it’ s the lingering uncertainty on several fronts and what now looks to us to  be a longer rebuilding and recovery period. Indications are that it could well be several more months before oil and gas production and processing return to near normal.  The latest reports from our contac ts indicate that almost 7 percent of U.S. daily oil production and 9½  percent of U.S. natural gas pr oduction remain shut in.  The assessment of da mage and the repairs to  pipeline and produc tion facilities in the Gu lf continue to be hampered by equipment and labor shor tages. Louisiana refineries ar e slowly coming back on line, but by current estima tes up to 6 percent of total U.S. refining capacity will remain off line until at least early next year.  And U.S. refineries are reportedly now oper ating at only about 80 percent of capacity. The situation with respect  to natural gas is even less clear  than for refined products, and there remains widespread concern that potential shortages over th e winter could keep natural gas prices elevated for a while. At the time of our last mee ting, I expressed concern about the impact of the storms on shipping and port facilities. It now appears that activity  is slowly returning to the Port of New Orleans, constrained by labor availability and access to land tr ansportation.  By an d large, ships that were inbound to New Orleans were diverted to other ports, so there wasn’t as  much disruption to the nation’s imports as there was to those export s that depended upon th e Mississippi River and Louisiana ports. At the last meeting I al so indicated that while we expected a significant regional hit to output, that would quickly be replaced by spending on cleanup an d rebuilding.  This is  generally happening, but the large-scale reconstruction is now not expected  to get under way until the first quarter of next            47 of 114year when insurance assessments have been completed an d comprehensive plans are put in place.  Commercial contractors note that there was a stro ng backlog of work prio r to the hurricanes; and this, coupled with labor shortages, will constrain the pace of rebuilding at le ast for a while. At the national level, I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment  that despite our heartaches along the Gulf Coast, the national economy seems to have remained relatively strong. And this was reinforced by last Frid ay’s initial reading of third-quarter real GDP. I view the economy as continuing  on a path of about trend.  However, I continue to wonder how the consumer will respond to higher energy  prices.  So far, the impa ct hasn’t been great, but there may be some important substitution effects when the consumer is f aced with substantially higher heating costs during the winter on top of still-elevated gasoline pr ices.  Spending may not and this could cause second-round effects in terms of cutbacks in production and investment.  In addition, we do know that auto sa les dropped early in the fourth quarter, due in part to energy concerns but also due to a re treat from employee pricing. I’ve gotten some recent and interesting anecdotal  information that is consistent with my concern about consumption and cons umer substitution eff ects.  Last week I chatted with a major wholesale supplier of groceries who has seen a significant recent pickup in business.  He noted that core wholesale grocery sales are notoriously steady  and boring, and he attr ibuted the measurable pickup in recent weeks to  the fact that more people were like ly eating in and, hence, were buying more groceries.  Similarly, an A tlanta director who is president of a major building materials and consumer products firm noted that his away-fro m-home product sales—st aples like paper towels and toilet tissue sold to restau rants—were slowing and that retail home product sales were up.  He interpreted that as consistent wi th the stay-at-home sentiment expressed by the grocery wholesaler.                  48 of 114This same director, however, al so commented on how serious the price pressures were due to energy and freight costs.  His company experienced a substantial earnings declin e in the third quarter, as he wasn’t able to pass on all of his cost increases to his cust omers.  Taken together, recent data and these kind s of anecdotes sugg est to me that downside ri sks to consumer spending still remain elevated. This brings me to the inflation risk, which is  my major concern.  As already noted by a number of people, we experience d a significant increase in both head line CPI and PPI inflation last month, which was expected.  This was largely due to energy and, in my view, is likely to be temporary.  At the same time, the core measures remained rela tively stable, but th e anecdotes about growing price pressures and actual or intended pr ice increases seem to be at odds with this continuing, going forward.   I note, too, like others , that the Greenbook has built in more of a pass-through of energy and other price increases into core inflation next year. There are some possible explanat ions that we’ve all given at one time or another for this seeming disconnect, including the fact  that the economy is relatively more energy-efficient and that we are evolving into a more se rvice-oriented economy so that en ergy is a much  less direct component of consumption.  And perhaps most importantly, there’ s the fact that intense competition is limiting the ability to pass inpu t price increases throug h to customers—for inst ance, the difficulty I noted earlier that the consumer products firm was having in pa ssing on energy costs.  A large athletic apparel manufacturer in our District, the Russell Corporatio n, attributed a large share of their third-quarter earnings decline to higher costs for poly-cotton blends that could not be passed on, very specifically because of intense fore ign competition. But these questions about pricing power are not, in my view, reasons to  be complacent about the inflation outlook.  The real fu nds rate is still low, there is substantial moneta ry accommodation                49 of 114in the system, and significant fiscal spending asso ciated with hurricane-related rebuilding has yet to come on stream. My concern is that deviating from our path of gradually re moving policy accommodation at this time could signal that we are less concerned about in flation and, therefore, cause some deterioration in inflation expectations.  It is this threat that I think we  need to guard against.   I view the cost of ratcheting down inflation expectations, should they get out of ha nd, as being great.  So I’d argue that we need to continue on our curren t path, at least for a while longer, including raising our fed funds target rate by 25 basis points today. As several of us have said today and in prev ious recent meetings, deciding what to say following today’s meeting may be more difficult than deciding what to do.  Realizing that our discussion of the statement often gets truncated, I also want to put down a brief marker.  Given my concern about keeping infla tion expectations in check, I would prefer a statement that is somewhere between Bluebook alternatives B an d C.  I’m concerned that “C” is too strong, but I am particularly uncomfortable with the ba lance of risk characterization in option B.  President Yellen has just offered some attractive statement language for us to  consider, and I think it’s terribly important that we make time at this meeting or at some other mee ting in the near fu ture to begin to talk about that seriously.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. SANTOMERO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Third Di strict’s economy continues to expand, with growth moderating towa rd its potential pace.  After accelerating in the second quarter, employment growth in the region decelerated in the third quarter back  toward its first-quarter pace.  But unemployment rates re mained steady for the three-state re gion and remained lower than the national average.              50 of 114Consumer spending for general merchandise ha s held steady.  There is some anecdotal evidence that consumers are limiti ng discretionary spending due to higher energy costs.  And there is some concern among retailers that fourth-qua rter sales may come in below plan because of subdued consumer sentiment and higher winter heating bills. Construction continues to be a strong sector for our regional economy.  Housing construction and sales remain strong in the District, and nonresidential construction ha s been on an improving trend since the beginning of  the year—with the usual month-to-month volatility.  Regional manufacturing activity accelerated in October.  The i ndex of general activity in our manufacturing survey rebou nded sharply from 2.2 in September to 17.3 in October.  The other forward-looking indices in the survey, including t hose for new orders and shipments, also showed a nice bounce, as did the index of future activity.  Perhaps the improvement in expectations should have been expected, since our September survey was taken in the early days af ter the Katrina event.  Indeed, in response to special qu estions, half of our firms reporte d that they had experienced some change in demand or problems related to the Gulf  Coast hurricanes.  The changes in demand, some positive and some negative, were generally slight.  Problems relating to obtaining energy and other materials, as well as transpor tation problems, were characterized as being somewhat more significant.  Despite these problems, our firms did experience an increase in activity last month. Again, the most troubling aspect of  our latest survey is the signif icant increase in  price indices.  The prices paid index rose sharpl y in October for the se cond consecutive month and is at its highest level since 1980.  The prices recei ved index also ju mped last month, sugges ting that some of the higher-priced inputs are being passed on to consumers.  The core PCE and core CPI share a correlation with our prices received index of about 0.6.  While most of this correlation is driven by          51 of 114the high-inflation peri od of the late 1970s and ear ly 1980s, I think these early indications of possible pass-through bear watching. In my view, the national economy seems to be evolving along the lines we had expected at our last meeting.  The economy appear s to have weathered the hurrican e in reasonably good shape.  And, abstracting from those hu rricane effects, the ec onomy has retained a good bit of positive momentum.  Of course, uncertainty remains about th e magnitude of the hurrican e effects, so there’s a wider band of uncertainty around  the economic outlook than there was pre- hurricane.  On the negative side, higher winter heating bills could resu lt in significantly  slower consumer demand.  But on the positive side, next year’s rebuilding activity could result in a bigger boost to activity than expected. The growth risk s seem to be balanced, and these hurr icane effects are most likely to be temporary. The bigger risk, in my view, is on the inflation side.  Core inflation remains contained at this point, and empirical studies suggest energy price pass-through to the core has typically been small.  Where we’ve gotten into trouble du ring the earlier energy price shoc ks is when we’ve let inflation expectations get away from us.  Indeed, the only departure between headline inflation and core CPI inflation as large as the current one occurred durin g past energy price shocks.  In those cases, accommodative monetary polic y resulted in rapid increases in core inflation. We cannot allow inflation expect ations to become unanchored, and I don’t believe we will.  As the energy infrastructure is rebuilt and energy market s stabilize, much of th e run-up in headline inflation should reverse itself, as  many people have sugg ested.  This will help keep inflation and inflation expectations contained.  We’ve already seen a decline in crude oil and gasoline prices.  The latter is particularly welcome, as  it could buoy consumer sentimen t as we head toward the buying season.           52 of 114Nonetheless, in my view, inflation pressures remain elevated .  So the prudent course of action today is to continue to gradually move rate s up nearer to the range of th e equilibrium re al rate.  As we near that range, our language is  going to have to evolve, as a number of us have indicated.  I don’t think today is the day for a major change in language, but I w ould welcome the discussion that many have suggested we need to have.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Hoenig.

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, th ank you.  My views on the na tional outlook remain pretty much unchanged from the last mee ting.  I think growth will be somewh at slower in the second half of this year and then stronger ne xt year due to the reconstruction activity.  The rise in energy prices will have a da mpening effect on growth to some degree.  None theless, the resilie nce that the U.S. economy has so far experienced foll owing the hurricanes suggests that  real GDP will grow at above trend, at least over the near-term forecast period.  Several other factors are consistent with that:  Financial conditions remain suppor tive; fiscal policy is stimulativ e; and as I’ve noted and many have already mentioned here today, there is a momentum  in the economy. Evidence from the Tenth District is consistent  with this outlook.  District manufacturing activity continues to expand at a solid pace, and capital spending pl ans at District factories have rebounded, after dipping slightly following the hu rricanes.  As a further sign of solid business confidence, hiring announ cements for District businesses have  exceeded layoff an nouncements by a wide margin since the last meeting. On the negative side, t hough, higher energy prices have er oded consumer confidence in our region as well as nationally, leading to somewhat slower consumer spending.  For example, retailers contacted in the first half of October reported sa les were generally unchanged from a year ago, a              53 of 114sales. Homes in so me parts of our District have been ta king a little longer to  sell, causing some builders to lower their prices or at least increase the incentiv es around the sales efforts. Turning to inflation, let me talk a little bit about evidence from our District, because we are seeing further inflationary pressures.  Wage pres sures, while still modest , are beginning to show through. Manufacturers are reporting sharply higher costs fo r natural gas and petroleum-based raw materials.  Some of our manufact urers are also reporting increased costs of building materials, such as steel and lumber, as a result of  the reconstruction effort elsewhere.  But adding to  this, District manufacturers are finding it somewhat  easier, as others have noted, to  pass their higher costs on to customers.  For example, in the sp ecial question we asked this mont h, 30 percent of the firms said that their pricing power had increased over the last three months, but only  14 percent said their pricing power had decreased.  Retailers have also been showing somewhat greater determination to raise prices to cover their higher costs, although the retail price increases ha ve been mostly modest so far. With this said, I want to tell Dave that I think today’s report on  the Greenbook and the discussion have been very, very help ful.  It’s beginning to redirect the discussion from one of a clear position of removing accommodation to a discussion of the correct range for the fed funds rate and where it should fall if we are to maintain stable pri ces and sustainable growth. Obviously, I share with others here the view that inflation is  currently the main concern.  Energy is an obvious pressure, there is strong momentum in mu ch of the economy, and there are some signs of changing inflationary expectations.  I think this is something we  have to be alert to.  But since our policy actions today have their final effects months in the future, I think it’s also important that we begin to address inflation and whet her the rise is transitory  because of the energy effect, or whether we are, in f act, seeing some inflationary pres sures that will become embedded                54 of 114going forward.  If it is transitory, then the question is, I think legitimately, wh ere should we stop? What is the right range?  Is it near where we are now or should it go higher? For now, my own views are that we should be moving the funds rate somewhat higher, as others have suggested, and that th is perhaps would be a reasonable place to stop.  What exactly is the appropriate area, I think, shou ld be a continued focus of this  Committee’s discussions in the meetings ahead.  I woul d also share the sentiment that we need to carefully rethink the FOMC statement coming out of these mee tings.  I think it is becoming badl y out of date and, as a result,

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Pianalto.

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  The worst position for a central bank er to be in is depicted in the Greenbook’s stagflation scenario.  I don’t think we’re headed there, but just knowing that it has a nontrivial probab ility is somewhat dist urbing.  And indeed, I’ve started to get questions from business people in  the Fourth District on whethe r I’m concerned about stagflation. With that possibility in mind, I’d like to speak first about the real economy and th en make a few comments about infla tion.  During this inte rmeeting period, I’ve had a number of conversations with directors, obviously, but we’ve also held  several economic forums  and business advisory council meetings. From these conversations, I’ve concluded that the busi ness conditions in the Fourth District are mixed.  First, I’ll comment on the positive news.  Steel  producers report that sales in most product lines are doing very well.  Commercial construction activity in the District picked up recently, albeit from a relatively low leve l.  Trucking and shipping firms continue to report that business is brisk and that they’re having a difficult time finding qualified drivers. Many firms report that they are             55 of 114planning to step up their cap ital spending next year, and inve stments—in foreign operations especially—continue unabated. Now for the not-so-positive news.  The problems in the automobile industry appear to be deepening, as signified by  the Delphi bankruptcy f iling.  Ford, GM, and a host  of their suppliers are concentrated in my Distri ct, and their restructuring activities are almost certainly go ing to be a drag on regional growth for a while.  In fact, there appear to be a lot of mergers, acquisitions, and restructurings taking place in the manufacturing sector, as was poi nted out by Pr esident Moskow. Certainly, the companie s that rely heavily on  natural gas and petrochemical feedstocks are facing severe margin pressures.   One of my directors from a la rge multinational ch emical company reports that the U.S. coatings industry is beco ming globally uncompeti tive due to the price and availability of natural ga s in the United States. Moreover, as others have mentioned, many business leaders are qu ite anxious about the impact of home heating bills  in the coming mo nths on consumer spending.  Some retaile rs are being especially cautious about their inventories, and companies further down th e supply chain tell me that they can quickly pull back capital spending projects if the need arises. Although the comments that I’ve been hearing ab out the real economy vary a lot by industry, I hear a much more consistent comm entary when it comes to the pricing environm ent.  Everyone I’ve spoken with is worried about the effects of higher energy prices and pricing psychology more generally.  It’s a fact that ener gy and other input costs have been rising.  Some of these costs are now being passed through successf ully, and I’m concerned that the climate has become more receptive to pass-through than  at any time in recent memory. One of my directors reported th at she has been trying unsuccessf ully to raise prices to a particular customer for the past several years.  Two w eeks ago that customer called her to say that           56 of 114he knew she was going to have to raise prices in this enviro nment and he was just hoping to get a heads-up on how much those pri ce increases would be and when they would come.  What that customer had previously regarded as unacceptab le was now acknowledged as inevitable.  An executive of a software co mpany that specializes in solutions to steel companie s told me that he is increasing his prices because hi s customers are finally making pl enty of money, so they’re now willing to accept his price increases.  To paraphrase  him and others: “Now th at the train is leaving the station, you’d better get on  with as much luggage as you can carry.”  [Laughter] Shortages of some raw materials are also likely  to add price pressures in coming months.  Several people reported that their suppliers are inv oking force majeure clause s in contracts.  Their suppliers are facing shortages of some raw materi als, preventing them from  meeting their contract obligations.  These people tell me that they’ve not  encountered such circum stances in 30 years of doing business, and they are concer ned about where prices are headed. I’ve not been as alarmed about inflationary pressures as my business contacts because core measures have been very favorable.  And I expect the headline numbers to improve next year.  But I can’t refrain from noting something about the polic y environment that’s im plied by th e Greenbook baseline projection.  An awkward feature of that projection is the trajectory of the headline and core inflation measures in 2006.  Af ter telling the public th at they should ignore headline numbers and pay attention instead to core inflation statistics, this Committee would be holding the fed funds rate steady during a year in which labor costs and core  price measures are expected to accelerate from their current pace.  This might indeed be the correct  policy, but it might appear to the public that we are tolerating a rise in core inflation.  Such  a situation could pose some additional communication challenges for us next year.  So, like others, I k now it’s time for us to start focusing on how we           57 of 114communicate these issu es.  But for today, I believe the approp riate action for us is  to continue to remove our policy accommodation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  Changes in District economic conditio ns have been small recently and seemingly largely offset each other.  So the economy overall continues on a positive path. Housing activity, especially the pace of sales,  has been slowing recen tly, although to some extent that is seasonal.  But I thin k it’s fair to say that overall some of the vigor  in housing is in the process of diminishing.  In contrast, commercial  real estate development has been picking up modestly and in a number of locations throughout the District, and developers seem more optimistic than they have for some time.  Manufacturing activity is continuing to advance.  The mining and energy industries are operating at high levels of capacity, as you would expect.  And employment is increasing, except at Northwest Airlines. I don’t think the underlying funda mentals of inflation have cha nged recently, but there are a few more reports in the District  of the ability to pass through cost increases —more reports than I had been hearing formerly.  Also , at a meeting of our Advisory Council on Small Business and Labor, there were more reports of products on al location than I had expected  to hear.  While there are ready substitutes for some of these products, for others, like concrete, that’s not quite the case.  And that will be, without question, constraining activ ity relative to what otherwise would have occurred. As far as the national economy is  concerned, I don’t have any ma terial disagreement with the Greenbook assessment of th e outlook although, if left to my own devices,  I might write  down a little more real growth in the next se veral quarters.  My se nse is that the econom y has a good deal of          58 of 114positive momentum to it, as others have observe d, and spending associated with recovery from Hurricane Katrina will add to  that.  I am also  encouraged on balance by the modest repo rts on core measures of inflation for the last  couple of quarters.  So, overal l, both the current state of the economy and its prospects lo ok favorable to me.  Core inflation ma y tick up a bit, as depicted in the Greenbook, but I would expect that  to be temporary.  And as far as the risks of stagflation are concerned, while I certainly woul dn’t dismiss that as a possibility—and I would acknowledge that the episode in the mid- and late-1970s initially, as I recall, snuck up on policymakers—it’s hard for me to develop a stagflation scen ario without serious monetary po licy errors.  And that’s in our power to avoid. Against that background, I woul d favor another ¼ percentage po int increase in the funds rate at this meeting.  I would also endorse the comments of President Yellen about the need to review and make some significant changes to the statem ent accompanying our decisi on.  And I think there that if we continue on the path  we’re on, we’ll be looking at a nominal federal funds rate of 4½ percent before long and a real rate  north of 2 percent.  At that point, are we still going  to be willing to talk about removi ng policy accommoda tion?  Will we be w illing to do it  at 4¼?  Today we’ll be at 4 percent, so I don’t think the time is far off when we’re going to have to conf ront these issues.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.  Let me say at the outset—to tr y to put some organizing structure into my anec dotal reports—that the reports on activity are almost  uniformly on the strong side.  And I think the reports on inflation are almost uniformly on the upside rather than the downside.  There is somewhat of an asymmetr y to the reports I hear.               59 of 114Let me talk about Wal-Mart firs t.  Before the hurricanes, let’ s say in early August, Wal-Mart was anticipating growth in same-store sales of abou t 5 percent year-over-year.  So they would have expected October to come in about 5 percent ab ove October of last ye ar.  Once they saw the hurricanes and had other information, including th e big spike in energy prices—of course, they believe that energy prices have a major impact on the income available to  the people who shop at Wal-Mart—they were expecting October to come in at  about 1 percent.  In fact, October same-store sales rose by about 4 percent, excluding gasoline.  So sales were much st ronger than they would have anticipated, given the informat ion that they had.  Moreover, they saw a pi ckup in demand for higher price point items.  In various discretionary categories, such as televisions, for example, more of the higher-priced go ods were being sold. I have a contact with a large West Coast software company, and that company is disappointed in the large enterprise segment of  its business but is seeing surprising strength in the consumer sector, including a shift in the consumer sector toward more expensive e quipment.  The example cited was that in the back-to-school market for the high school and college segments, there were more purchases of laptops, which are mo re expensive than desktop computers. My contacts in the package-delivery industry ar e anticipating a very st rong holiday season; indeed, they are expectin g demand in the peak week prior to  Christmas to outrun capacity.  The expectation that they will not have enough capacity in place is due in part  to the rapid growth in Internet sales and th e home deliveries associated wi th that.  Also, they pointed to a particularly large unexplained increase in business in the Chicago area recently, both inbound and outbound.  They have no idea why.  I said I woul d consult with my colleague on the FOMC to see if he has any insight.  So maybe during the coff ee break he can tell me what’s goin g on in Chicago.   I don’t think the World Series was enough to cr eate this outcome.  [Laughter]             60 of 114MR. MOSKOW. Don’t underes timate it.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Another example that I thought was quite interesting was that UPS is actually shifting its over-the-road shipment s away from the piggyb ack rail system to long-distance trucks in order to gain shorter transit time.  My contact said that  the railroads are simp ly unwilling to put the investment into their track and equipment and op erating systems to matc h the delivery times.  Obviously, it’s much less fuel-e fficient to ship by truck, but the pressure on de livery times was leading UPS to switch its operations in that direction. On the price front, my Wal-Mart contact said that general merc handise prices are still falling a little bit. Food prices  have been up abou t 1½ percent over the last y ear.  However, Wal-Mart noted that its suppliers—I think this would be primar ily domestic suppliers—have indicated that they expect to take some price increas es after January 1, although not en ough to completely cover their cost increases.  Wal-Mart is not seeing price increases on goods that  are sourced abroad, particularly from China of course.  Wal-Mart has continued to absorb increases in transportation costs and utility costs. That’s the story for retailers generally.  It ’s obvious that they’re  not going to absorb those costs forever, but they have  been doing so temporarily.  My Wal-Mart contact also noted that their construction costs for new stores  and other facilities are rising in a range of 10 to 15 percent.   And in a recent luncheon in St. Louis with local real estate people, house builders, and others in the business, many said that they  also see substantial upward pressu re on construction costs.  It’s not just the cost of la nd—or ground, as th e homebuilders put it—but ma terials and labor costs are under substantial upward pressure. One other thing that I thought was interesting came from my contact at UPS, where they’ve just completed—I think the negotia tions are completed—negotiations with their pilots.  Apparently the pilots had no increases at all in 2003 and 2004, but UP S is going to pay retroactive increases in a              61 of 114lump sum.  And I suspect that these lump sum payments will escape incl usion in the ECI measurement, given the way the ECI is put together .  I see Dave Stockton shaking his head.  The other thing that was really quite surprising is th at they are paying signing bonuses for new airplane captains of $45,000 to $6 0,000.  You would think,  with all the pilots being released from the passenger airlines, that they wouldn’t have any trouble hiring pilots.  But apparently the strength of the union is such that it ha s been able to work that deal as part of the settle ment.  UPS is anticipating that their pilots, now making $190 per hour, will be up to $223 per hour in  2006.  They will be the highest paid pilots in the industry. The one other thing I would say is  that I share the Greenbook for ecast, but I do believe that the inflation risks are asymmetric.  It ’s much easier for me to imag ine a ½ point forecast error with inflation coming in on th e high side, rather than the low side, of the point forecast.  I think that’s where I’ll stop now.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  All right.  Shall we break for coffee?  Let’s come back in a reasonable period of time. [Coffee break] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  We view the ba lance of developments since the last meeting as strengthening the case fo r further firming of monetary po licy.  The underlying pace of demand growth seems reasonably strong—a bit stronger than we thought at our last meeting.  The inflation outlook to us looks largel y the same as it did in September,  with the expected path of core inflation higher than we would like and some risk of further acceleration. On the assumption th at we increase the fed fund s rate on the higher traj ectory now priced into        62 of 114potential in ’06—somewhere between 3 and 3.5 percent—and for the rate of increase in the core PCE to stay in the vicinity of 2 pe rcent.  Of course, this has to be  considered an implausibly benign view of the world [laughter] and the expansion still faces a familiar array of ri sks.  But we don’t see evidence yet of a substa ntial slowdown in demand nor of a troubling acceleration in underlying inflation. The balance of risks in this forecast has change d a bit.  I’m a little le ss concerned that the cumulative rise in energy prices will itself bring about a more substantial and extended slowdown in growth, although that obviously ha s to remain a concern and possi bly the principal risk to the growth outlook. We believe that  the modest expected tightening of financia l conditions will have less of a dampening effect on demand growth than the Greenbook assumes.  We don’t see strong evidence yet of a significant d eceleration in housing price apprec iation or expectations of that outcome in household spending behavior, although both would be  desirable.  The evidence of strong stability in the gr owth of household consumption is, in a sense, borrowing against a future cushion, and that perhaps raises the probability of a more  adverse path to futu re consumption.  But it’s not here yet. As in September, the relative pr obabilities of alternative inflati on outcomes still seem slightly skewed to the upside, thus probably justifying mo re cumulative firming in  monetary conditions.  Core PCE has remained moderate, compensation growth modest, pr oductivity growth strong, and long-term inflation expecta tions reassuringly low.  But the size of the rise in headline in flation and the deterioration in nea r-term expect ations creates the possibility of some further drift up in underlying inflation if, as we expect, the labor ma rket firms further and unit labor costs eventually start to rise more rapidly.  We’re seeing some drift upward in core  inflation outside of the United States.               63 of 114On balance, to us this suggests we need to ma ke sure that the market  remains confident we’ll do enough to bring inflation and inflation expectations dow n over the next two years.  To put it differently, we should make sure that we take  out enough insurance to avoid a more adverse inflation outcome, and in this sens e we should be pleased that the market has ra ised its estimate of the terminal fed funds ra te to around 4½ percent.  Our st atement today, I believe, should be designed to be neutral to those expectations, rath er than to raise or lower the expected path. I do think it would be helpful if the minutes  reflected some discussion today about the approaching need—the approaching need, not the need today—for some  changes in the structure of the statement. We’ve been very fortunate to date in how well we have managed this  transition in monetary policy, with the market expecting a sustained period of tightening but its expectation of the terminal fed funds rate varying with change s in the outlook.   Our decision to put a soft, qualified, conditional ceiling on the fed funds rate pa th at 25 basis points a meeting has not cost us to date any erosion in long-t erm credibility, though it probably ha s encouraged the market’s investors to take more duration ri sk.  The remarkable st ability in quarterly GDP growth and in core inflation we’ve seen has tended to reinforce expectations about the outlook for monetary policy, adding an unusual degree of certainty about the likely path of the fed funds rate.   This has to change.  As we become less certain about the path ahead, that increase in uncertainty needs to get built into market expectations.  The questio n is when and how  we alter our statement to reflect this.  So far,  the dominant strategy be fore us has been to keep moving 25 basis points, to signal that we will cont inue to do so, and to defer any ma jor changes to the structure of the statement until we are conf ident we have made our last move.  Now,  this may turn out to be the optimal choice, but the language feels increasingly stale.  An d it may be better, in fact, to change the language before we are forced to, when we still be lieve we have some firm ing ahead of us.  This               64 of 114might make the trans ition ahead more gentle.  It would give us more than one shot at recalibrating the signal, and it might help bring the market’s uncertainty about what’s ahead more in line with our own. There are two areas where changes in the statement seem indicate d.  The first is in how we characterize the rationale for our action.  There we  have some room to be come more explicit about our view of the outlook relative to our objectives without going all the way to a fully articulated, quantitative forecast. Th e second, of course , is in the end of the st atement.  If the world in of us, we could, for example, re place the last three se ntences of the statement with two which state our views more simply.  They would state first th at the outlook for growth  and inflation suggests that further monetary policy firmin g is likely to be necessary, and,  second, that the Committee will respond to changes in economic pros pects as needed to maintain price stability so as to achieve sustainable growth. This would get us out of some of the risks of repeating “measu red” going forward.  It would help address some of the problems  in using the word “ accommodation” to signal tightening.  And it would eliminate the awkwardness in the superfluous balance of risk sentence we now have.  This would allow an easy evolution to  a more neutral signal when th at becomes appropriate—with a simple statement that policy is no w roughly appropriate but that we will act as necessary to achieve our objectives going forward. Of course, the world may look different in Dece mber, and we have to assess then what makes the most sense.  I don’t know that  we can say with conf idence today that evolution in December is ideal or necessary, but I think we need to prepar e ourselves and the markets for some evolution.  Thank you.              65 of 114CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  Unlike President Geithner, I view  the incoming information over the intermeeting pe riod as having mixed implicatio ns for what might be required from us to keep inflatio n in check.  On the one hand, demand and output, as he noted, appear to be continuing to grow at a pace that over time is likely to gradually put added pressure on resources.  Apparently, the tightening of monetary policy, the ri se in energy prices, and the appreciation of the dollar in the first half of the year were not enough to slow growth to trend in the third quarter.  And the September employm ent report and October da ta on initial claims sugge st that the underlying pace of job creation has b een maintained going into the fourth quarter.  Moreover, demand over the next few quarters, as many of yo u pointed out, should be boosted by the ramping up of rebuilding efforts. Still, conditions do seem to be in place for a mo deration in growth over the intermediate term.  Financial conditions have tightened.  Interest rate s have moved higher; in response the exchange rate has firmed and stock prices ha ve dropped a little.  A ll of the increase sinc e the last meeting was in real interest rates, and most of the rise didn’t se em to be in response to data, but rather to our own speeches, making it unam biguously restraining.  In addition, volatilities ha ve backed up a little and risk spreads have widene d just a little since the middle of the summer, sugge sting that investors are a bit less confident about the future, even if they ’re still too confident. Data and anecdotes on housing markets hint at some moderation, and that began even before the recent rise in rates, perhaps as a consequence of the earlier increases in interest rates as well as the elevated level of house prices relative to incomes.  Home equity loans at banks actually fell last month, suggesting that equity extracti on is no longer so attractive.  But as best we can tell, without a new repeat-sales index, the rate of increase in the prices of existing single-family homes has not               66 of 114slowed, while price increa ses for condos have moderated very little and re main quite high.  All in all, we seem to have reached an inflection point in the housing market, fortunately.  And house price increases, working through the wealth channel and as  an inducement to construction, should be less of a stimulus to demand in th e future, though how much and how fast is a very open question. Higher energy prices could take something of f of consumption, even after gasoline prices And the negative results  of consumer sent iment surveys—which persisted into October, even as gas prices declined—could be  suggesting a more mark ed response than we’ve seen over the past few years of increases. In the staff forecasts these for ces slow the economy to a rate of growth slightly below its potential, even with a slight easing of financial conditions as policy firms less than the market has built in.   It’s as good a guess as any and better than any forecast I might make.  Given the range of uncertainty, however, the important point for us at th is meeting is that growth  is likely to slow to closer to the rate of gr owth of potential, but it’s probably going  to take at least a couple more policy firmings. The news on prices and costs ha s been more favorable for the in flation outlook.  Core inflation has been damped, despite substantia l increases in energy prices before the hurricanes.   Because the increases in the prices of petrol eum and petroleum products have been large and sustained, they are more likely to show through to core prices than at any time since 1980.  But I’m encouraged by the lack of much response so  far this year.  And energy prices themselves have eased off much more than expected when  we last met. Pass-through effects of past increases in energy prices in  the staff forecast are magnified and persist for a time because of the as sociated increase in inflation expe ctations.  In th is regard, the         67 of 114results of the Michigan Survey are cautionary , but long-run forward measures of inflation compensation in the market have risen only modestly, and they do remain well below their levels of last year and the early part of th is year.  I suspect that household inflation expectations will ease back if gasoline prices retreat, as they are expected to. Business labor costs ar e probably not putting mu ch upward pressure on prices.  The trend in ECI compensation continues to be  favorable, including wages a nd salaries increasing at a 2½ percent rate for several quarters now .  The lack of upward pressure is especially no teworthy in the face of huge increase s in consumer energy costs, and it seem s inconsistent with tightness in labor productivity growth in the third qu arter was strong, holding down the ri se in unit labor costs.  In the Greenbook, compensation an d core prices accelerate  noticeably over coming quarters.  In my view, incoming price and compensation da ta raise the odds that the pickup  could be a bit smaller, with inflation settling at a sligh tly lower level if output follows the Greenbook path. On attitudes, we’ve had competin g anecdotes at this  meeting.  Most of you—I think the majority of you—seem to suggest that businesses are sensing some increase d pricing power.  That would, if it’s true, support the staff forecast; but it hasn’t shown through in actual prices paid by consumers as of yet.  Because the economy seems to have a good deal of forward momentum at a time when resour ce utilization is high, and beca use higher energy prices do threaten to feed through to core prices and inflation exp ectations, we need to continue firming until we have some better indications that conditions are in pl ace to keep inflation restrained. Underlying trends in output and employment will be ob scured by the effects of the hurricanes, including the onset of re building efforts, an d this circumstance probably amplifies the already present danger of overshooting with our policy.  I’m not sure myself how  useful estimates of r*, the              68 of 114neutral federal funds rate, will be in reducing the risk of overshoot ing.  They do provide a rough guide that we’re in the neighborho od, but I don’t think they’re a very  precise measurement.  In that regard, I myself am not uncomfor table retaining the “a ccommodative” language until we decide we don’t need to tighten anymore.   I’ve defined accommodative for my own purposes as too low [laughter]—too low to acco mplish my objectives. I think we can mitigate  the risk of overshooting in po licy by keeping our eyes on the underlying drivers of resource utilization and de mand—such as hou sing prices and household reaction to energy prices, as well as cost pressures and inflation ex pectations.  And I do think the “measured pace” of tightenin g has been helpful in this regard as well, in contrast to 1994 and 1995 when tightening picked up at the end and I think the risk of overshooting increased.  I’m comfortable with tightening again at  this meeting and signaling that we do not think we are finished removing accommodation.  But just what we should signal about our expectations for the future will require a fresh look at each meeting, and I support the general sentiment that we need to look at our language very, very carefully  going forward.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON. Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  In preparation fo r today’s meeting, I surveyed the CEOs of three large regional banks in the Southeast,  the head of th e Bankers’ Bank in Texas, and a banker in Biloxi, Mississippi, hoping primarily to ge t an idea of the rate of recove ry, although to a certain extent to get a reading on the amount of devastation from the st orm.  The way to  look at it, I think, is to do it in bands going out from the point of the storm where the greatest damage occurred.   The banker in Biloxi reminded me—maybe inform ed me—that although mo st of the publicity was about New Orleans, the damage to the Mississippi  Gulf Coast may have been  at least as bad.  I see President Guynn nodding in the affirmative to th at.  From the beach to 600 yards in, everything              69 of 114is gone from the Alabama coast to the Louisiana bo rder.  They are experien cing at the moment 24 percent unemployment and labor shortages, simultaneous ly, due to the fact that people can’t stay in the area when they have lo st their houses in addition to their jobs.  In his ju dgment, 25 percent of his customers have left the area.  So  some restaurants there are on re duced hours because they do not have the labor to keep them open.  It is this banker’s  expectation that it will be five years before the city of Biloxi recovers and that it will recover only because of a change the legislature has granted, allowing the gaming indus try to move their operations from o ffshore barges to on land.  There’s going to be a significant transition  in the mix as a result of that.  It is the gaming industry, and more broadly the service indust ry, on which the recovery  will be based.   If you go from that immediate band out one more, to the areas not quite as heavily impacted by the storm, you get a completely different picture.  In the estimation of one bank  with a significant Alabama presence and a significant Southeast presen ce, it was about three weeks between the time the storm hit until the banking activ ity—consumer and comm ercial loans—was pret ty much back to normal.  The remarkable fact, whic h they hadn’t expected because it was completely different from other hurricane experiences, is that the number of  checking accounts—two different banks gave this information—has doubled.  This activity has doubled. Compare that to the Biloxi area  where, over the years, hurri canes have generally been good for banking, because what  the banks do during th e recovery process is re cycle or, if you will, intermediate, insuranc e checks.  That is now happening more broadly throug hout the region, but it also suggests that a very significant realignment or redistribution of population is taking place throughout that area. Similar to the experience  that President Fisher noted, housin g units as far away  as Atlanta are filling up, as they are certainly in Houston and in othe r areas.  Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has doubled                 70 of 114in size; and it appears, based on the apartment rentals and home purchase s, that that is at least semi­permanent.  More broadly, skilled workers throug hout the Southeast are flocking into the storm-impacted areas, the attraction be ing the difference in wage rate s they can rece ive.  A side implication of that is that construction projects in  other parts of the Southeast have been delayed or in some cases postpo ned, both because of the un availability of labor  and also the in crease in prices of building supplies. Pulling it all together, the info rmation I’ve received fairly well corroborates the Greenbook in terms of the impact of the storm— namely, that outside of the most heavily impacted area, economic activity proceeded largely unabated.  And it suggests that we are clearly seeing evidence of price pressures, both in wages and in building materials. That being the case, it do es seem that a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate at  today’s meeting would be appropriate, describing the rationale for doing it in the language of altern ative B.  But I strongly support President Yellen’s suggestion that we look at how we comm unicate what we do.  Si x or eight months ago,  when I thought about approaching the point where we were close to a positio n we would de fine as equ ilibrium, I was comfortable that we’d have a clear sense at that time as to where we were goin g and what I could be looking for. But I don’t.  And I don’t know if that’s consistent with just where we are in the cycle, so the decisions are tougher, or if it’s because we are getting some mixed signals at this point when we are close to a transition. I have heard this morning a very strong indication of the need to guard against inflation and to identify inflationary pres sures.  I’ve also heard a very good ex planation for the fact that long-term inflationary expectations in partic ular, as Governor Kohn suggested, are well contained.  But I think we are at the confluence of a num ber of events, one of which is that we are clearly reaching the point where our policy will cease to  be accommodative.  Second, we  are clearly reaching the point            71 of 114where the wording of the statemen t has outlived its usefulness.  And third, we are approaching a transition in leadership.  And I think all of us are aware that  while there perhaps have been weaknesses in our communication,  and maybe even in our analys is, there has been enormous confidence in our leadership. In my experience, the only time that this body  has significantly confused the market is when we have tried to make a change both in our po sition and our communication simultaneously.  If we add in a transition in leadership, I would hope that if there is an y miscommunication it would attach to the communication, not to the tran sition.  So in my view, December  will not be too early to think about the confluence of all of th ose events.  But for today, I certainly support the 25 basis point increase and the defin ition of it in alterna tive B.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  What I’d like to do today is to talk a little bit more about some recent trends in co nsumer borrowing information, which a few people have already mentioned, and then just make  some general comments on th e economy and on inflation. As a couple of you have alread y noted, the data on consumer borrowing ha ve shown a lot of noise, as I would call it, in the last couple months.  Overall, we’re seeing a sl owing in the rapid rate of growth.  It’s still grow ing in general, but the pace of growth is  slowing.  So it raises the question of what is really happening here.  Are consumers saying that they  are nearing the point at which they really can’t absorb any more debt?  Or are changes in underwriting un der way that are slowing the pace of growth? As you know, the Senior Loan Officer Survey, covered in th e supplement to the Greenbook, reported only modest change s in demand for credit; it was modestly lower.  And to the extent that this could reflect consumer demand , we know that motor vehicles sales have slowed in the last          72 of 114couple of months, as the big incentives came off.  Also, we’re beginning to  see a moderation in the pace of increase in median housing prices.  So th at could be consistent wi th a slowing in demand. On the other hand, if we look at the chart in the Gr eenbook on bankruptcy  filings, there was a huge spike in the week prior to Oc tober 17, just before the new bankruptcy law went into effect.  And that could have front-loaded anywhere from three to four qua rters of bankruptcy filings, as everybody tried to get in before the law changed.  We saw a tremen dous increase at that point.  It doesn’t reflect what the banks are showing in the quality of their credit or in the securitized transactions that are ou t there in the market where delinquency  rates have basically been fairly stable. So this was a blip up ahead of what our normal le ading indicators are showing. On home equity lines, I find the numbers really  remarkable.  Home equity lines grew 31 percent in 2003, 44 percent in 2004 , slowed to 17 percent growth in the first half of this year, and now, as Governor Kohn just mentioned, have shown declines in September and Oc tober.  So the question is: What is happening w ith these home equity lines?  As  you know, the banking agencies collectively put out common guidance in May re garding home equity line s.  There was really nothing new in this guidance.  It just pulled toge ther what was out there to remind everybody what safe and sound lending practices are.  We know that th e vast majority of banks follow these sound procedures in almost all of their le nding.  So I felt comf orted that in the Senior  Loan Officer Survey only a few banks said they had ch anged their underwriting standard s because of the new guidance.  That to me says that we did rea lly focus on the outliers, which was our  intention.  So  I don’t believe that this reining in of home equity lines is due to  underwriting changes.  We  know that home equity lines have been used not only to extract equity fo r spending but also increasingly for downpayments on purchases of homes—more so  than in the past.  So  again, this could reflect something more that is going on.                 73 of 114As you know, the banking agencies later this quarter are goi ng to issue some guidance on mortgages and on loans for commercial real estate.  Again, our intention is not to signal alarm that overall credit quality and underwriting  are poor, but to call attention to some lendi ng practices at the limit that are raising some concerns.  So at the margin it could have some impact on the pace of lending, but we think overall thin gs are in pretty good shape. The other point I want to make is about credit  card lending.  More th an a year ago now, both the OCC [Office of the Comptrolle r of the Currency] and the Fed st arted to raise questions about underwriting and credit advances for borrowers who go over their lines of credit and about minimum payments expected on cr edit card balances.  A growing number of customers were not being required to cover late payment fees or fees for going over their credit  line and actually were into negative amortization when  their outstanding balances exceeded their lines of credit. We’ve given the banks quite  a bit of time to figur e out how to get into compliance with these guidelines.  Some started do ing so toward the end of last year and some will be do ing it later this year; so they are moving at thei r own pace.  The change in practices will slow  credit growth for some clients—the ones who chroni cally are over their lines and who have paid on ly the minimum monthly fee.  Again, we don’t exp ect this to be widespre ad, but it could be a fact or in some of these bankruptcy filings. People who have  been at the fringe of being overextended are realizing that they’re going to have to get their borr owings down. Now let me shift my focus to the overall economy.   I find that the pace  of the expansion has been quite resilient, given everything that we’ve be en through in the past year.  Recently, despite significant difficulties, whether it was hurricanes or  the spike in o il prices, growth continued at a sound pace in the mid-3 percent range.  And the staff forecast shows more  of that next year.               74 of 114Inflation has slowed in the last couple of months, but I’ve focu sed a bit on the nature of the developments there.  As you know, some of the slowdown has been  in prices of services.  And with some of the trends we’re seeing in  core elements of  inflation, getting a number over 2 percent, as the forecast has, begins to give me some concern.  So I lo ok at that and at the forecast for a continued rise in labor compensation costs. A potential slowdown in  productivity also suggests that we need to be much more attentive to what ’s going on in terms of cost pressures on the labor front that could affect workers’ expectations of compensation increases.  So I think it’s even more important for us to watch inflation in the next few months. I support raising the funds rate  today.  I also support the dialogue, as President Yellen outlined, on the elements of our communication so th at we have an orderly transition.  We ought to look carefully at every word in ou r statement.  While it will be pa rsed when we make changes, at least all of us will have had some time to think about th e changes.  And I would hope that we have that dialogue at our next meeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor Ferguson.  

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like others, I am  somewhat, though not fully, reassured by the incoming data.  The economy clearly  appears to be on an expansionary track, not having been seriousl y damaged by th e seriously damaging hurricanes .  Additionally,  readings of core inflation have been surprisi ngly benign, given everything we  know from our models and the anecdotal data we’ve heard from others on the cumula tive effect of the rise in energy prices.  More importantly, during the intermeeting period, inflati on expectations for both the next five years and for the 5- to 10-year horizons are little changed.  At least they have not changed much since the last meeting and could reasonably be described, as they were at the time, as being contained.              75 of 114As the earlier dialogue between Vincent and the Chairman indicated, I did ask the staff to give me some information on how inflat ion expectations and energy pric es interact.  Let me summarize just three points from that data.  First, of all the categories of en ergy prices—spot crude, gasoline, far futures, natural gas, and hea ting oil—it seems that sp ot crude is the one th at drives inflation expectations most firmly.  Second, as Vincent indicated, across the 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year horizons for inflation expectations , the 2-year horizon is really the one that is most heavily influenced by spot crude oil pric es.  And third, as I think Vincen t said, even there the impact on inflation expectations of spot crud e in the 2-year horizon is relatively muted: A 1 percent increase in spot crude oil prices, at least in these models, tend s to go to a 0.7 basis po int increase in inflation expectations.  So while we’re aware of the importance of energy prices, it turns out that in terms of driving inflation expectations, there are many other things that are equally important. Having said all of that, let me now turn to the broader issues of import at this meeting, which are what to do and also what to say.  Some one quoted Yogi Berra.  I’m going to quote that equally famous poet, Archilochus, whom some of you may recall from th e 7th century B.C.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I knew  him well.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. He famously said, “The fox know s many little things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.”  The reason that’s important here is that while the various readings we’ve had on the incoming data are ex tremely importan t, in some ways they are in the category of “many little things.” And the one big thing—th e big thing that Dave noted in his opening remarks—is that the staff now has a forecast for the next 18 to 24 months  of an economy that, with just one or two more tightening moves, is likely to enter a phase of growth below trend, wi th inflation pressures gradually subsiding. I think th is is really the first time in this period that the outlo ok shows, afte r the long and           76 of 114variable lags, the impact of the cumulative tightening that  we’ve undertaken.  An d the forecast does indeed show that the economy is likely to slowly respond to our tightening regime. I find this actually quite  credible because I believe, as does the staff, that th e funds rate is probably within the range of its equilibrium real le vel and will certainly be within that range with one or two or more tightenings.  I think it’s fairly important to put that on the table. While I fully respect Don’s view that one can’t put too much we ight on these point estimates, I think it is important for a Committee of our sort  to have some sense of whethe r or not we’re in  the range of equilibrium. Having said that, I do think a number of forces are pulling and pushing agai nst the economy and leading us to this level.  Here I would pick up on a point that President Lacker made—and I certainly agree with him—that the impact of these hurricanes is mo re likely to have been on the supply side than on the demand side.  However,  I would say that that’s a partial equilibrium analysis.  And ceteris is clearly no t paribus in this case, because there are a number of forces that are also driving the demand side inde pendently of the hurrican es.  Let me just highlight two or three of them.  One I continue  to be worried about is th e mystery of what it is th at’s driving businesses. Dave raised in his opening remarks the point I’ve made a few times—that the investment/GDP ratio still seems relatively low, cer tainly compared to its le vel in the last decade. There is some survey evidence that CEOs and CFOs still have some unce rtainty.  Anecdotal disc ussions that I and some others have had suggest that some of this uncertainty  has to do with whether or not to invest in the United States or overseas.  And th e second part of the uncertainty is  still, I think, a lingering concern that these elevated energy prices will eventually play  through to lower demand. While others may disagree, I think the large ne gative net equity issu ance and the willingness of businesses to repurchase shares or to engage in  cash-financed mergers, against the backdrop of             77 of 114ample liquidity, is primarily a sign  that businesses are somewhat skeptical about th eir ability to reward shareholders with a reason able future return on internal investment.  And, therefore, they during this earnings season reinforces this view th at there’s some downward pressure that shows up in a slightly lower equilibrium rate than we wo uld have had otherwise. Second, I would pick up on a point that both Don Kohn and Sue Bies made having to do with developments in the housing sector , and why for households in par ticular there is a sudden fall-off in the demand for HELOCs [home equity lines of cred it].  Again, I think that  creates a little bit of downward pressure on the neutral rate. We may also see during the next  couple of years an increase in  the saving rate , both for the reasons that the staff talked abou t and also due to cont inuing uncertainty about pensions, which has surely been very much in the ne wspapers.  I think that, plus the ongoing discussions about Social Security reform, will perhaps dr ive households to save more.   And finally, to pick up on Ka ren’s point—a point that we haven’t talked about much today—I think net exports during the forecast horizon are likely, if anything, to continue to be a drag, if I can use that word, though  I understand your mathematical point.   

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE.  Please don’t.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. They will be an arithmetic subtraction from measured GDP in the U.S. economy. I think all of the conditio ns that have driven that in th e past, including foreign exchange rates, relative interest rates, and most importantly  the productivity story an d an absence of domestic absorption overseas, are likely to result in the ex ternal sector being an ar ithmetic subtraction from GDP more so than  an addition.                   78 of 114In my view, all of those things l ead to a credible story that says we are, or soon will be, in the range of the neutral rate.  But wh at does all that mean?  I think it means that we should clearly be vigilant about inflation because th ere are some upside pressures, bu t I agree with Cathy and others that we don’t have to be vigilantes about inflation.  To put it another way, I think the scenario in the Greenbook that has us  going to an interest rate  of 5 percent, dr iving the economy to  a growth rate that’s far below potentia l, opening up an output gap, and havi ng unemployment of 5.5 percent, is not something that we need to embr ace.  In fact, it’s so mething that we need to be cautious about. So that’s my view on what to do.  The implic ation, obviously, is th at I’m quite comfortable with a 25 basis point move today,  and I won’t preclude future disc ussion by suggesting what we ought to do going forward.  But I don’t find the Greenbook  implicit assumption terribly unattractive. The second question then, obviously, is what to say.  I applaud Janet for opening that topic.  In my view it’s important for it to be on the table.  I come out at a differen t place from where Janet comes out and also from where I think Don comes out.  I’m not co mfortable keeping this language until we think we’re done, because I’m not sure we’ll ever really know that with enough certainty.  I think the language do es need to evolve.  I agree with Tim’s view that it seems a little stale at this stage.  I would very much be in the camp of favoring some forward-looking language of one sort of another.  The sort that I prefer is the kind of la nguage that deals with the outlook in terms of our dual mandate, with respect to both growth and inflation.  I know that in the period I’ve been here there were times when growth and inflation were not pointing in the same direction or when the risks to our growth and inflation objectives differed substantially.  So I think we need to separate them. I recognize that the market only wants to know what’s going to ha ppen with regard to interest rates.  From years of discussion around this table, I th ink most of us, myself included, are perhaps a                                                                               79 of 114little uncomfortable going that far with our forward-looking language, beca use we know that there are many factors that ca n change the outlook betw een one meeting and anothe r.  So I’d be very cautious about that. I do encourage us to have this discussion in  an orderly fashion be tween now and December, and maybe again between December an d January.  But having said all of that, Mr. Ch airman, I think what to do and what to say today are fairly clear.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Than k you.  Mr. Reinhart. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART.2  Thank you, Mr. Chai rman.  I’ll be referring to the materials that Carol Low is distributing. Over the intermeeting period, market partic ipants marked up their expectations of your coming actions, as seen in the drift upw ard of Eurodollar futu res rates in the top panel of the first exhibit.  The rate for c ontracts ending this year, the black line, and next year, the red line, rose 40 and 50 basis points, respectively.  Three factors apparently came into play.  First, the econo mic effects of the spate of hurricanes this fall seem less momentous now, at least to  market participants , than they did on about the economy that lowered rates in ad vance of the September meeting was rolled back.  Second, data releases, on net, were  read as evidence that the economy had considerable momentum in ad vance of the landfall of Hu rricane Katrina.  And third, many of you expressed concerns in public about inflation risks, and those statements were taken as a warning of more tight ening than previously anticipated. The net result was to shift up the path ex pected for the federal funds rate, plotted as the solid black line in the middle left panel, by ⅜ to ½ percentage point relative to that prevailing before the Se ptember meeting, but by only ⅛  to ¼ percentage point relative to the August meeting.   The funds rate is now anti cipated to peak at about 4½ percent in futures markets, which is a touch below long-ru n expectations of the funds rate suggested by the Blue Chip survey.  As shown in the middle right panel, the surveyed economists see the te rminal funds rate at around 4¾ percent.  That same survey, however, suggests that economists pitch a pretty big tent, in that about 50 percent of their responses span a range from 4¼ to 5¼ percent. This ratcheting higher of policy expectatio ns was associated wi th a tightening of financial conditions more genera lly, seen in the bottom panels as the rise in longer­2 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).                          80 of 114term Treasury yields, de cline in stock prices, and apprec iation of the fo reign exchange value of the dollar. If you are worried that this financial market reac tion was overdone, thereby imparting too much financial restraint, you might favor ho lding the intended funds rate at 3¾ percent today—the subject  of the left-hand panels of exhibit 2.  As noted in the first bullet at the top and in th e middle panel, the staff forecast of th e growth of real GDP for 2006 has been mark ed down over the course of  the year.  You may see reasons why this might happen again—say, because the economic dislocation from the hurricanes could be larger than expected or  because household spending could sag as real estate values stop escalating, or even decline, and as consumer confidence, plotted in the bottom left panel, sinks further.  If so, the shock in  financial mark ets in reaction to alternative A would certainl y realign market expectations  lower.  Indeed, even if you viewed inaction today as likely to be me rely a pause in the process of firming, it might be difficult to convey that to the public, making it likely that the rotation downward in rate expectati ons could be considerable. More probably, you’ll find the arguments  for tightening ¼ point —in the right hand side of the exhibit—to  be more compelling.  In partic ular, as the top bullet point and the middle panel relate, you might view the upward drift in the staff’s inflation forecast for 2006 over the course of the year as signaling that the risks to the price outlook are on the upside.  A number of you have noted at previous meetings that inflation was running on the high side of  your comfort zone, suggesting that the prospect of any further rise would be especi ally unwelcome.  In th at regard, you might consider the pickup in th e Michigan Survey responses  of near- and longer-term inflation expectations, plotted at the lower right, as evidence of such an unfolding dynamic. A ¼ point firming might be seen as suffic ient at this time to keep inflation contained, as long as it wa s expected to be followed by at least a fe w more moves going forward.  The difference between altern atives B and C in th e Bluebook hinges on how many more tightening moves you see in your future—which could be conveyed by the language of the statement.  With the aid of exhibit 3, I’d like to cover some of the same grou nd as President Yellen, but more colorfully, if I say so myself. [Laughter] This exhibit takes as a starting point the statement issued in September.  Among the pertinent questions are: 1. Is productivity growth still robust (the red text)? 2. If the nominal funds ra te moves up to 4 percen t, will po licy still be accommodative (the green text)?  3. If policy remains accommodative, are yo u likely to remove that accommodation at a measured pace (the blue text)? 4. Is there an appropriate path of moneta ry policy that will balance the risks to your dual objectives in the face of a supply shoc k?  (By now, I’ve us ed up much of my color palette—but I think it’s the purple text.)                       81 of 114I would remind you that, even if you do  not want to address some of these questions this afternoon, the passage of time could ultimate ly force you to  do so.  An earlier, rather than later, dialogue about th ese issues would provid e the opportunity to use the minutes to forewarn the world of changes in lang uage that has been unchanged for so long that the public  might be forgiven for thinking it was carved in stone. Exhibit 4 provides some perspective on th ese questions, starting with the table at the upper left listing the four-quarter grow th of output per hour over the past few years. The 4 percent growth rate of productivity in the third quarter pulled the four-quarter change to 3 percent.  While the FOMC statement refers to underlying, not actual, productivity growth, this performance may well make you comfortable retaining the “robust” characterization.  In that  regard, as can be seen  in the chart at the upper right, the private-sect or economists in the Blue Chip panel continue to see output growing at better than a 3 percent pace in the long run, an assessment that has been essentially unchanged over the period  the Committee has asse rted that underlying productivity growth  has been robust. As for assessing the degree of policy acco mmodation, the middle panel shows that bringing the nominal funds rate to 4 percen t would place the real  funds rate at the midpoint of the range of the staff’s estimates  of its equilibrium level.  There are three reasons, listed in the bottom left panel, why you might think that describing policy as accommodative is nonetheless appropriate, beyond Governor  Kohn’s gutting the word of any meaning.  [Laughter] First, you might believe that the staff is  underestimating the vigor of aggregate demand, perhaps because we’ve penciled in  too big a drag on consumption from higher energy prices and an as-yet-unobserved slowing in home-price appreciation.  If so, your personal estimate of the equilibrium r eal rate of interest would be to the north of that plotted in the chart.   Second, you might believe that the real rate should be calculated based on a forward-looking proxy for inflation expectations, not the backward-looking four-quarter act ual core inflation rate used in the chart.  If you also believe that an inflation scar e has pulled expected inflatio n above its recent pace, then the real rate lies to the south of that plo tted here.  Third, the gap between estimates of the equilibrium real rate an d its actual level may not be an appropriate measure of policy accommodation at all.  Mechanically, the staff calculates the equilibrium real rate by determining, within a given model, the level of the real rate that would close the output gap in about three years.  You migh t view the path of the output gap in the transition to its ulti mate closure as unlikely to unwind current pressures on inflation or three years’ time to close the output gap, you might not like the infl ation rate likely to prevail then.  The chart in the lowe r right panel showing the recent jump in energy prices is a reminder that you might label the current set of forces im pinging on the economy as a supply shock.  As the textbooks tell us, a supply shock confronts monetary                   82 of 114policymakers with unpleasant alternatives, as it tends to weaken aggregate demand and put upward pressure on infl ation.  In such circumstances, there might not be an appropriate path of policy that balances the risks to your dual objectives.  That is, you might have to accept—and relate to the p ublic in your statemen t—unbalanced risks. Exhibit 5 presents four alternatives for th e language in the relevant part of the Committee’s statement.  As in  the top panel, you can limp along at this meeting with the current wording, reassured by the fact that this woul d likely preserve something close to the current path of expected future tightening, b ecause few market participants anticipate any change. As in the second panel, you can get out of the business of characterizing the degree of policy accommodation by describing the ch ange, not the level, of the funds rate.  Thus, you could say that “. . . policy firming can continue at a pace that is likely to be measured,” which implicitly admits the possi bility that you may ha ve to impose policy restraint, on net, to check inflation.  This could estab lish the precedent of providing guidance by writing a fresh ch aracterization of the odds of your likely future action at each meeting, appropriately conditioned on  the economic outlook .  I know that I discourage easily, but I’d like to point out th at this was exactly what you were doing with the addition of the “measured pace” la nguage in Ma y 2004.  But if the policy outlook does not change materially from me eting to meeting, fre sh language can get hardened pretty quickly. As in the third panel, you can replace the current risk assessment with a formula based on an unchanged stance of policy, thus providing a coarse si gnal of your likely future action. My argument for tilting at this wi ndmill one more time  is that such a formula both provides some transparency about your intentions an d should simplify the process of the Committee coming to closure on the language of the statement at each meeting.  In my view, pr ior efforts to find a satis factory formula to provide guidance about your future po licy intentions ran aground be cause most proposals were too ambitious by inco rporating assessments of levels  and changes of the Committee’s dual objectives.  A simpler fo rmula—perhaps even couched in terms of interest rates rather than the Committe e’s goals—is more likely to last.  If it is not specific enough on some occasions, you’ve got the rationale part of the statement and the minutes to provide a more nuanced view. The fourth panel would be appropriate if you wanted to scrap the risk assessment entirely. However, reflecting on the discussi on of the Committee an d its succession of subcommittees on this subject over the y ears, I think those of you who prefer the simplicity of this alternativ e may be tilting at your ow n windmill.  By my count, enough members seem to believe that there is some  role for words in narrowing of the statement for some time to come. It has been a feature of my briefings for what seems to be a long time to remind the Committee that a discussi on of your communications policy is warranted.  I now                 83 of 114know the wisdom of the maxi m from the “Monkey’s Paw,” “Be careful what you ask for, you might get it.”  Becau se you have spent some time discussi ng the issue, the minutes will have to address the topic. It is also pretty cl ear that this conversat ion will continue in December.  To inform that discussion I propose circulating a survey fairly shortly to probe your views on key principles governing the statem ent of the sort Governor Ferg uson discussed.  My goal is to get back to the Comm ittee before the Dece mber meeting with a summary of the results to make it easier to find the middl e ground among the various views that have been expressed. For your convenience, the last exhib it updates Table 1 fr om the Bluebook.  Relative to what you saw there, we’ve take n comments from some members that I think simplify the discussion of  the outlook in rows 2 and 3. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Qu estions for Vincent? 

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Vincent, I have a question that concerns al ternative C in Table 1.  Currently, the only part of the FOMC statement that th e Committee votes on is the balance of risk section, and that now includes the forward-looking “measured pace” la nguage.  My sense is that, to the extent we continue to have forward-looking  language in the statem ent, it’s something the Committee should vote o n.  But in looking at alternative C, what you did there was to move the forward-looking language into the descriptive ra tionale part of the st atement, which in my understanding is not subject to a vo te.  To me there’s a go vernance issue there th at I find troubling, and I wondered if you would co mment on it. Was your expectat ion in alterna tive C that the forward-looking language would no t be voted on?  Or do you envi sion the Committee voting on the entire statement?  So, my question has to do  with governance.  

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. I think it’s a governance issue for the Committee to  decide.  I was presuming that you would continue to vote on at least a portion of the statement, the part that contains the forward-looking language.  But it is an  open issue why you vote only on a part of the statement and not the entire document.  

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Is there a reason  why the vote now do es not cover the rationale sentences?          84 of 114MR. REINHART. What the Committee voted on has changed over time. Initially, starting Committee did. Some where about a year and a ha lf later that characteriz ation was dropped, and it became less clear whether it was the Committ ee’s statement or the Chairman’s statement.  By 1997 or 1998, market participants generally viewed it as the Committee’s statemen t.  Most of the people sitting around this table, I think, viewed it as the Committ ee’s statement. When we last rethough t what the Committee voted  on, it seemed import ant to bring into the statement the forward-looking guid ance, the risk assessm ent portion, and that’s  why we did that.  So, it has evolved.  I a ssume that it will evolve again if yo u change the basic structure of the statement. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Vincent, I had a que stion on a different part of th is.  You raised  the issue of whether you should use th e inflation projection in your calculation of the eq uilibrium federal funds rate instead of the backward-looking inflation numbers that you use.   I was wonderin g if you could elaborate on that a bit. I certai nly would think that the forecast wo uld be a better measure to put in here than the backward-l ooking figures.  What  is the argument or the logic for putting the backward-looking inflation numbers in there? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. The main one,  which has been reflected so mewhat in the conversation already, is that it’s hard to know  what inflation expectations are.  We don’t have a consistent proxy over the entire period. And it’s not obvious that if you took the entire sa mple and estimated your model using measures of inflation expectations that you necessarily would have a different gap right now because you would not only chan ge the actual expected real funds  rate, but you’d also change your estimate of the equilibrium real funds rate.          85 of 114MR. MOSKOW. Maybe I misstat ed my question.  I’m not talking about an inflation expectations forecast but the inflation forecast  you have.  Why not pu t that in the model? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. Among other thin gs, the staff inflation forecas t is judgmental and need not be accepted by the Committee.  I think computationally you’re talking about something, if you wanted to go to the F RB/US model, that would be difficult to do and— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If you put in an infla tion forecast, you’ve just targeted inflation to a point, not a range. That’s what will happen.  We’ll be locked in to explaining why we didn’t move on either side of the fore cast.  I think it’ s very tricky. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. Let me also say, President Moskow, th at the passage of ti me is helping in terms of providing ot her measures of the equilib rium real funds rate.  We now ha ve indexed debt quotes. We use them  to back out an estimate of the equilibrium real funds rate.  We don’t have a long enough time series to know its properties as, sa y, a predictor of aggregat e demand or inflation.  Over time, I would think that woul d become a more standard feature of our analysis, although this analysis is done in Dave Stockt on’s area, and I wouldn’t  want to commit his resources.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. You probably did.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think we’re missing an opportunity as fiscal agent for the federal government to have an audience for this meeting and coll ect revenues, which could probably balance the budget!  [Lau ghter]  President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Setting aside the governance issues that Janet raised, it seems to me that the key operative phrase and the change in alternative C is taking  out “accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured” and repl acing it with “likely maki ng further policy firming necessary.” I’m of the sc hool that we likely have a little bit further to go, partially driven by our own analysis of the inflation tr end—meaning PCE inflation data—tha t we do in Dallas.  But I’m          86 of 114curious as to what the staff ventures might be the market reaction to this particular wording change.  Would changing this language to  “making further policy firming ne cessary” sound as if we have a more severe situation on our hands that we  are worried about?  Wh at’s your judgment? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. In talk ing about market reacti on to potential statem ent wording, you’re getting as far from economic science as what we do here , and that’s pretty far.  It is hard to say, and would send a signal that you envisi on not stopping at what you thin k is the neutral rate but going above that, and so market participants would rais e their sights for how mu ch you would tighten.  But that’s only a guess, and that’s  the guess we put in the Bluebook. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I think that’s right.  I believe it would be viewed as very hawkish because you’ve taken out the accommodative language and you’re talk ing about firming.  So I think Vincent is right that it would be taken as a very hawkish statement. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. I guess I would like to make a couple points about th at.  When you think about the language, the characteriz ation of “accommodation” and the “measured pace” are linked.  So if you were, for instance, to take out “accommodation” while leaving in something about “measured pace,” that would signal that you’re going pa st the firming now anticipated.  On the other hand, if you left in “acc ommodation” but took ou t “measured pace,” ma rket participants would probably view that as an indication that yo u want to pick up the pace of tightening—that is, start doing 50 basis points. The other thing I would like to me ntion is that this proposal real ly is, in a sens e, “back to the future.” The Committee at one point did signal its in tentions about th e possible future direction of its next action in the form of the directive.  An d the experience back in 1998, when th e directive became part of the Committee’s st atement, was that market par ticipants didn’t deal with the         87 of 114conditional nature of that directive very well.  If you were leaning in one di rection, they tended to just slam into that corner.  So th e purpose of the old balance of risk  language was to step back from there by talking about the Committee’s goals.  So, those are all among the things that the Committee would have to consider in framing new statement language. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, since Vincent has raised the question of process, and I get the sense that we’re probably not prepared today to de al substantively with changing the statement, I’m wondering out loud if we  shouldn’t try to go even  further than Vincent ha s suggested between now and the next meeting.  Perhaps we should try to get ourselves in a positio n at least a co uple of weeks before the next meeting where we have some vi able optional language work ed out that we could make operative at the next meeting if we choose to. It has been pretty clear that we’re not going to  have a very productive discussion today on the statement—or next time either, unless we do some  work on it in advance.   Given the amount of thinking that has been done on this and the suggestions Janet ha s made and Tim has made, I think we ought to be able in a couple or  three weeks to get something on th e table that we could all look at if we truly want to have an option that we could exercise, if we choose, at  the December meeting. So I just want to push on the process side a little bit and ask if we could do that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  I think that’s precisely  the direction in wh ich Vincent is going at this point. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. I really  didn’t want to promise too mu ch in my prepared remarks. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. I would push a little bit. MR. REINHART. The sequ ence I envision is fi rst surveying you on ge neral principles.  Are you comfortable with putting in forward-looking language?  If th ere’s forward-looking language,        88 of 114would you prefer it to be  about interest rates or the risks to your objectives ?  There are differences of opinion on a number of  those basic questions.  Then once those survey results are collated—to see if there really is a middle gr ound or if there are a couple of distinct alternatives that lend themselves to these questions —I’d send a document around. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. But we need to have that more than a couple  of days before  the meeting if we’re really going to have somethin g that’s workable.  I guess it sounds like what you have in mind is what I’m hoping we can do.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions?  To quote some body from last night, why don’t I proceed?  [Laughter] Something very unusual is occurring both in the econo my and, as a consequence, in monetary policy deliberations.  Esse ntially, this surprising ly long—and I must say in retrospect rather successful—interval of incrementa l measured changes over a protr acted period of time, has turned out a lot better than I think we co uld conceivably have imagined.  Bu t it’s clearly coming to an end.  And I think the reason it’s coming to an end is that our grasp on wh at’s going on in the world is a little more tenuous than it was when we started.  You may recall that we had a general view of the way we thought the world wa s going to work in the spring of 2004 when we  started to indicate that we were going to tighten.  The ma rkets all began to respond.  The duration measures, the convexity measures, and all the various fo rward-looking measures were ad justing the whole structure of interest rates in the context of how we and the rest of the world thought the world was working.  Then suddenly the whole thing crumbled.  It crumbled becaus e there was essentially an X factor out there which we had not anticipated—a disinflationary force.  And we worried about that.  It resurfaced this year, and I think we finally co ncluded that it reflected essentially the significant increase in the active wo rkforce in the market economy.  That  increase was a result of over 100              89 of 114million people from the former Soviet Un ion coming from a ce ntrally planned, isolated economy and being added into the wo rld market economy.   Even larger, but a little later was the addition of  a workforce of 750 million in China, as that country began moving in the direction of market forces.  And more lately, In dia—although India is a bit laggard in this respect.   The consequence, of course, was to double the number of work ers in the labor force who are participating in world markets.  They are not necessarily wholly involved in tradable goods, but there has been a definite shift in the structure in the world labor fo rce.  These are educated, but not highly productive workers;  and obviously, they are producin g a much smaller fraction of world output in these emerging nations than is coming from the developed world.  But what we are observing is this phenomenon where unit labor co sts are undergoing for the world as a whole a significant but one-time change.  If we had the data, which we would have only very  crudely, we could ma ke a judgment as to what bringing all of these people in to the workforce does to world unit labor cost s.  Indeed, we have all sorts of examples of  what’s happening at the margin, not the least of which is in the United States. In Germany the impact of workers from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland is very pronounced.  It’s very pronounced in the United St ates and in a lot of co untries as a result of China’s workforce. What we are clearly seeing are disinflationary forces that are reflected in inflation premiums in the longer tranches of the interest rate market.  So, the tenth-ye ar tranche of the 10-year note has been really quite suppressed and only very recently has moved up. We know without actual data that  the shift, which politically occu rred in a very short period of time, cannot occur that rapidly econ omically.  There has been a grad ual absorption of all of these people into the labor force.  An d we know that it is, indeed, a one-time event.  When you’re          90 of 114experiencing gradualism from  a one-time event, the rate of ch ange at which th e transition is occurring has a very significant impact.  I would argue—looking at world inflationary patterns and the high correlations between core inflation worldw ide and the remarkable decline in inflation in the emerging world—that this is a global process.  Even in earlier period s when we had low inflation in the developed world, we had huge problems in the developed world.   We do not even have that anymore. We have, as we were discussing very early in th e meeting, this converge nce of interest rates, so that what we are looking at is quite eviden tly a global phenomenon.  And when we try to reconcile, as we are trying to do , the anecdotal evidence of thes e inflation pressu res that we’re seeing with what’s coming out of our models, there is a dissonance.  In other words, the models are not consistent with an anecdotal example of the ki nd President Fisher was ta lking about in  terms of the surge in prices in  Texas.  A lot of you have  noted similar examples.  It  goes beyond the issue of a mere pass-through of energy cost s.  Energy costs are being passed through, we know, and because profit margins generally are not being squeezed by it, we’re essentially seeing a full pass-through.  But because the productivity  in the use of energy is clearly im proving, the pass-thro ugh is in fact partial. There’s more to this story, th ough, than we’re observing beca use energy is a much less significant factor than it used to be.  Indeed, we’v e just had a decline in th e last two months of 57 cents a gallon at the pump for regular gaso line.  Now, that is clearly go ing to have effects, though we’re not quite sure what they w ill be.  But it strike s me that our real policy problems involve how to make a judgment as to what ph ase we’re in of this disinflationary  set of pressures.  When does it eventually come to an en d—or more exactly, when do  we get enough of the adjustment so that the adjustments thereafter slow down?   What that means is that the di sinflationary effe ct on just the           91 of 114normal rise in structural unit labor costs worldwide is easing.  In other word s, if there’s a lot of pressure, that pressure will keep the inflation rate down.  But the deflationary  pressure eases as we complete the process, and we be gin to get—and would expect to get—a gradual rise in core inflation.  And that is what we’re ge tting.  That’s not to say that we’re getting a rise in core inflation.  What we have to do, I think, is  come to grips with a very larg e element of uncer tainty regarding how this process is emerging and how it’s going to come out.  I do think that the indications of the rise in core inflation, as modest as it is, may be—and I underline the word  “may”— a sign that the first difference of that adjustment  process is changing.  Yet we’r e not getting it in the inflation compensation.  To be sure, as I said, the 10-year tranche has move d up 20 to 25 basis points.  It’s not a big deal; indeed, a good part of  that could be r eal and probably is. So we’re really delving in to areas where our past experience is not all that  helpful.  If in the spring of 2004 the big surge in ex pectations in terms of where the 10-year note was going to end up and where the mortgage rate was going to end up had actually materialized, we’d be in a different world today.  And that world woul d be based a lot on the way our old models worked and the way certain relationships have worked in history.  Bu t there is something new he re with which we have to come to grips.  And strangely enough, the most beneficial way to address this particular subject in our communication, in my judgment, is through the statement.  In the statement, we are, indeed, recognizing the elements of uncerta inty with which we ar e confronted.  The surety we had and went forward on starting in th e spring of 2004—in terms of how we  were viewing deve lopments and the appropriate policy to follow—has proceeded literally almost uncha nged.  That’s really quite a remarkable stretch. But it’s over .  Or I should say it’s about on th e edge of being over because we can no longer be as sure as we we re about the interm ediate-term outlook.            92 of 114I feel a little queasy abou t using the word “accomm odative” for a 4 percen t federal funds rate largely because, as you may recall, we didn’t get to “accommodative ” until we went from 2 percent to 1¾ percent in the ear lier period.  So I find th at Don has the obvious solution to all of this.  “Accommodative” is the state we wa nted to leave for whatever reas on and, therefore, raised the rate. [Laughter] In any event, yes, I do thi nk that we need to move today.  I woul dn’t worry about the statement being stale.  It has be en stale for a very l ong time.  [Laughter]  And it’s not going to change that much.  I think at th e December meeting we’v e got to make some fundamental choices, and it would certainly be he lpful if we could come together and essentially complete  the structure of what we are going to do—if not in  actuality at least the conceptual  underpinnings of it—so that we will be on a new path with new wording.  And depending on how Vi ncent decides he wants to read your responses to his questio nnaire, perhaps we will have  a new statement.  [Lau ghter]  So that’s the direction I would suggest we take.   Now, the actual wording of the proposed statement, I think, is slightly different from what we have here, isn’t it? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. No. The one in my briefing material is—

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  My apol ogies.  So everyone has actua lly seen this.  If it is acceptable, this is the statement we will be going with.  I would, therefor e, put it as a suggestion that we move 25 basis points an d use the alternative B statem ent as is.  Governor Kohn.         93 of 114MR. KOHN. I agree with your recommendations—moving 25 basis points, sticking with this language, and giving full consideration to new la nguage between now and th e next meeting.  I’m actually not as worried as some ot hers about the statement being stal e.  It has been  accomplishing our objectives, I think, in an am azingly successful way.  Markets have correctly interpreted what we’re talking about and what we’re doing.  We haven’t had the slip-u ps that we had when we were changing language a lot.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We want to be reas onably clear in which direction we may change it rather than leav e the question open.  Just to say we’re going to ch ange but we’re not going to tell you how, I thin k will create substantial unnecessary uncertainty. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Well, should we take some of  your thoughts in term s of how the minutes are written?  My understanding of  what you said—and what I think I heard around the table,              94 of 114although not explicitly—was that the statement woul d have a sense of greater uncertainty about it.  It would be moving in the direction of not prom ising as much going forward.  Now, maybe I’m reading too much into what you said. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  That’s what I did say.  That’s  what I believe. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I can’t speak for the rest of the Committee in that  respect, but we’ll all be vetting the mi nutes so we can try to do our best in conveyin g our thoughts.  My only concern is not to introduce a ne w uncertainty in the process since we’ve done except ionally well for so long.  Being innovative has less value than I think we’ve realized. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  May I just add to that comment?   I think we need to be careful not to telegraph in the minutes any change  until we have a little more  confidence about how we want the statement to evolve.  So I think the minutes can reflect the fact that we’re discussing, as the world hopes we’re discussing, what ev olution might be sens ible.  We’re not— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The term is “ongoing discussion.”  Th at will clarify it.  That’s basically saying: Don’t take this as some dramatic change. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Then it’s not a surprise; if something diff erent comes out, it would be the result of an ongoing discussion. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes.  President Santomero. MR. SANTOMERO.  I support your recommendatio ns.  Just to continue on this topic, I think we all have to be careful, number one, to read what’s in the minutes and, number two, to think about what we’re going to say when we’re asked about the minutes a nd what it is the minutes are communicating.  We know there’s going to be a ra sh of questions about what  it means.  And I think                 95 of 114we just have to be prepared for what we as indi viduals are going to say to the press when they ask about what is that ongoing conversation. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  But, Mr . Chairman, may I say something? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I don’ t think we normally take it upon ourselves to try to interpret the minutes for the wo rld.  We let the minu tes speak for themselves, and we convey whatever personal views we have abou t what we think going forward, but— 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  All I’m pointing out is that the press is going to say, “You talked about changing.  What do you mean by th at?”  I think we all just have to be prepared to recognize that that’s an inevitable part of mentioning in the mi nutes ongoing discussions about change.  Perhaps it’s obvious to all, but it will be a new area of inquiry by the pres s, and we have to recognize that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We might want to get involved in that as we proceed with the minutes and see where, in fact, everybody is.  Perhaps we can gi ve, implicitly at least, some guidance as to what we all ough t to be doing when the minutes  come out.  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  I support your recommendations, Mr. Chairman, and I supp ort the statement. I just want to register a thought or two about language.  As we approach December, I recognize that the change in language that everyone is anticipating is a change that would be associated with stopping or at some point modera ting the pace at which we increas e the funds rate.  I, like Don Kohn, have always interpreted “accommodation” to mean the rate is less than what we think it’s going to be after the next meeting.   I can’t think of another coherent way to interpret that.  I think that is always what it has meant. In that regard, there are lots of  words that people use that invol ve implicit coun terfactuals.  The word “neutral” is one, for ex ample; the word “equilib rium” is another one. I understand very                  96 of 114well the mechanics of what the Bluebook does, but that to me doesn’t correspond to a path our economy could conceivably ge t to from where we are now.  So it has always troubled me for us to make reference to these fairly complicated and el aborate counterfactual simulations in describing interest rates. And I’d be relu ctant to go in the dir ection of the formulaic option that Vincent put before us yet again—with compli ments for his persistence—that makes reference to something that’s clearly off the equilibrium path. Let me mention another thought about language.  I recognize that some around this table don’t share as heightened a sense of concern about an uptick in  core inflation as I do.  My fear is that that has some positive probability.  And if at some point we  feel about a rise in core, if it should move up, the way we felt about a fall in core in mid-2003, I think we  would find it desirable to communicate our dissatisfaction wi th that and our intention to pr event it.  Obviously, our sequence of communications in mid-2003 ha d some fits and starts, but it wa s ultimately the communication of our intentions that stabiliz ed expectations.  That established sort of an effective floor to the level of inflation that market part icipants thought we were willing to tolerate.  An d I worry about  changing the statement in a way that everyo ne associates with a pause when there’s still a likelihood out there that we may have to engage in a communication exercise of another sort .  I’ll leave it at that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Well, I accept your  suggestion, Mr. Chairman.  I was just thinking about the introduction you provided, which is something I’ve  been consumed with because I’m supposed to give a lecture at Harvard on Thursd ay night on the globalization of  monetary policy.  I’m worried about the phenomenon that you desc ribed—it’s one of the reasons I f eel quite hawkish even relative to President Lacker—and the direction in which it is proceeding.  Let me cite a small data point.  The retailers will tell yo u that they got 10 percent relief last y ear from China but that they’re only             97 of 114getting 5 percent relief now .  Now, where that num ber comes from, I’m not quite su re.  But the point is that the disinflationary mitigating factor is being reduced, and yet we have no sense of the measure of capacity or of the utilization of capa city outside our own border s, particularly in the parts of the world you spoke of.  And I want to make sure, however we word things and whatever we communicate in the minutes, that  we don’t close the door to st ill be very vigilant, though not vigilantes, on the inflation front.  But I accept and support your recommendation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. Mr. Chairman, I agree with your recommendation  on the rates and I support your plan to review the la nguage, as we’ve all talked  about here or, as you put it, to continue our ongoing discussion of the language going forward. Just a comment on the po int—I forget who said th is but I think it was Tim—that the statement speaks for itself and the minutes sp eak for themselves.  I agree comple tely with that. And I think it is important, as we gi ve talks and answer questions, that we make it clear that our comments represent our own personal views.  They are not interpretations of the minutes.  They are to be read as “In my view, X or Y….”  I think that is a very important distinction to make going forward. Let me add just one final point.  I, too, am concerned about inflation, as we all are around this table.  And I must say that I th ink the costs of inflat ion coming in above th e Greenbook forecast now outweigh the costs of infla tion coming in below the Greenbook forecast going forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern. MR. STERN.  I support all part s of the recommenda tion—the change in the funds rate, the existing language, and the possibility that we will  alter the familiar language  at the next meeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson.          98 of 114MR. OLSON. I support the reco mmendation, Mr. Chairman.  Wi th respect to the language, what I think I’m supporti ng is the process by whic h we will be looking at what changes would be appropriate.  But I certainly agree that the next meetin g is the appropriate time to look at it and that in order to do that we need some intermediate communication about the options. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, there are words and phrases that I’ m not as comfortable with as I’d like to be, particularly the part dealing with infla tion risk.  The word “pot ential” has crept into the sentence in terms of inflation pressures; I se e those pressures as clea rly there and not just potential.  But I certainly can support your reco mmendation and I look forward to a discussion between meetings of how to fundamentally rest ructure the statement we’re using.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Yellen. MS. YELLEN.  Mr. Chairman, I su pport your recommendation fo r the policy move and also the statement today. A nd I look forward to  more detailed discussions ab out revising the statement going forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. MS. BIES.  Mr. Chairman, I support the 25 basis point increase and the language in alternative B, and I lo ok forward to seeing how Vi ncent will help get a consensus within this group.  One thing I’ve learned is that when ever we try to tinker with this, we end up with a wide variety of viewpoints around the table.  So  I wish him good patience with a ll of us as he tries to get our comments in. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  He can find agreement where none exists!  [Laughter]  Governor Ferguson.                       99 of 114MR. FERGUSON.  Mr. Chairman, I support your  recommendation of 25  basis points.  I support the language in alternativ e B.  On the issue of what we should say about the minutes, I would caution all of us to be very careful because the real answer is we do n’t know.  To say much more than “ongoing discussion” perhaps is signaling more than  anyone wants to or should. On the question of whether or not we should wait until we’re fu lly done tightening before we change the language, I think that  will create an incredible gong reverberation th at says, “Boy, they’ve changed the language .  They must think they’re  really done.”   In my view, the reality is that if we change the language  before we think we’re really done, th en the language can evolve in a way that may be more helpful. Having broken my sword on this issue over se veral years with the help of Don and then Vincent, I, too, look  forward [laughter] to seeing  the wisdom of Vincent.  And I admire the way he will bite the hand that feeds him.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Mr. Chairman, I su pport your recommendation on th e rate and the language for today.  I’d like to make just a couple of other points.  There has been a lot of discussion in the newspapers and among peopl e I talk to about the influence of the remarks in our speeches regarding our concern about inflation risk.  That clearly, I think,  has made a difference to market sentiment. And with respect to the neutral rate, I hope that we don’t star t making statements that we regard the neutral rate as being a narrow range or a number.  These calculati ons come from a model. One way of looking at  this is that if the neutral rate has averaged about X over some historical period, we might anticipate that that would be the average going forward.  Ho wever, the rate that is consistent with equilibrium at any moment of time ha s varied a lot.  If we look at 2002 or 2003, for example, the rate was lo w and yet the economy was barely movi ng forward.  If we look at 1983,           100 of 114that was a period of vigorous reco very from the 1981-82 recession, and the real federal funds rate was about 6 percent.  So the rate that at any moment of time is c onsistent with equilibrium can vary widely, and I hope we do n’t give the impression that the neutral rate is  some narrow little target toward which we are likely to go.  We talk about it as an average of  historical experience.  I think we could really be misleading the market as to where we’re likely to end up if we leave the impression that it’s in the neighborhood of 4½ or 4¾ percent or any othe r such number that we might mention. Secondly, I’d like to point out that the Greenbook forecast for th e core PCE inflation rate next year, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, is 2.3 percen t.  And there is a view abroad in the marketplace that some members of the Committee have an explicit target range in mind  for that measure of 1 to 2 percent. Others will sa y that by revealed preference the Committee has ma de clear its preference for an inflation target of 1 to 2 percent.  And if we, in  fact, consistently start getting year-to-year inflation rates that are noticeably above 2, we are going to produce a market reaction that we need to be aware of—one that may well be ahead of us—a nd understand where that  may take us.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I s upport your recommendation to  raise the fed funds rate 25 basis points and to use the language of alternative B.  And I want to clarify just for the record, given what Mike Kelley said last night, that in not rushing immediately to compliment you on the brilliance of your proposal I’m not  implying any less confidence [laughter] but actually more confidence. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let th e record show that I had an enigmatic expression.  [Laughter]                           101 of 114Ms. Danker, would you read the appropriate language? 

[SECTION]

MS. DANKER. I’m readin g the directive wording from pa ge 24 of the Bl uebook:  “The Federal Open Market Committee se eks monetary and financial cond itions that will  foster price stability and promote sust ainable growth in output .  To further its lo ng-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future  seeks conditions in reserve mark ets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate  to an average of around 4 percent.” And the assessment of risk, un changed from the September st atement, is:  “The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sust ainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes th at policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be meas ured.  Nonetheles s, the Committee w ill respond to changes in economic pros pects as needed to fulfill its obli gation to maintain price stability.” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Call the roll, please.

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  I have a ques tion.  I think you read the assessment of risk without the word “remaining” in it.  Maybe I misunderstood what you read. 

[SECTION]

MS. DANKER. I read it from this ta ble as unchanged from September. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Which one  are we voting on—with remain ing or without remaining?     102 of 114SEVERAL. Without remaining. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  I just wanted  to make sure.  I got confused  about what we were looking at in that line.  That’s  fine.  My vote stands. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Let’s have a recess, and the Board of Governors will convene  in my office. [Recess] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  The Board passed una nimously the requests of all 12 Reserve  Banks for an increase in the discount rate to 5 percent.   Our next meeting is Tuesday, December  13, 2005.  Shall we go to lunch?
