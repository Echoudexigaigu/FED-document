CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning, everyone.  Mr. Kos, will yo u start us off, please? MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be referring to the handout that is in front of you. With the year-end approachi ng, I thought I’d look back  at 2005 a bit.  One of the more surprising market developments has been the steady—if low-key— appreciation of the U.S.  dollar.  That strength is all the more surprising after the dollar’s depreciation in 2004 when it appeared that  the current account imbalance had hit a threshold that was impacting exchange markets.  But, as shown on the top of page 1 of your handout, the trade-weighted  dollar has appreciated by 8 percent since the start of 2005. The dollar’s strength was broad-based ag ainst all major currencies.  As shown in the middle left panel, the dollar rallied from below 105 yen to 120 yen.  That last 10 yen—from 110 to 120—came in a nearly straig ht line and was coincident with Prime Minister Koizumi’s victory in the Se ptember elections and the ongoing improved sentiment about the Japanese economy.  Risk  appetite among Japa nese investors seems to have risen and capital outflows have accele rated, as investors look to pick up yield in fixed income markets not only in the United Stat es but also in markets such as the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand. As shown in the middle right panel, the do llar has also risen against the euro.  At the start of 2005 the euro was trading at about $1.35.  Today it is below $1.20. Sentiment toward the euro has been poor, given lackluster growth and the widening interest rate differentials w ith the dollar—but I’ll comment more on that later.  Among the few currencies that the dollar depreciated against were  the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real. Both countries have s ubstantially higher nominal a nd real interest rates, and both central banks in recent months have been easing policy. At this point, you might be asking yourself : Whatever happened to the issue of the current account deficit?  Weren’t the imbalances  supposed to lead to a weaker dollar?   Certainly, that explanation appeared to work  last year when the dollar was falling.  The bottom panel of the first page graphs the trade-weighted dollar—the red line—and the current account balance for the United States  as a percent of GDP since 1980—the blue bars. Ideally, this should show that when  the deficit is high, a weak dollar follows.  While there have been a couple of periods when growing current account imbalances were followed by a subsequent bout of dollar weakness (for example, in the period after 1985), there are examples of just the opposite as well.  The dollar strengthened in the early 1980s and also the late 1990s in th e face of high and rising current account deficits. When looked at quantitatively, th e correlation between the current account and the next year’s excha nge rate is weak.    1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).                 4 of 100What, then, explains the dollar’s stre ngth?  The most compelling explanation— and this is tentative, I should say—appears to center  around the economy’s strength relative to other major economies.  That diffe rence in performance is , in turn, reflected in interest rate differentials, as shown on pa ge 2.  This page graphs the sovereign G-7 yield curve in green, the U.S. Treasury curv e in blue, and the G-7 curve excluding the United States in red. The composite yield curves are based on GDP weights for each country. At the beginning of 2004, U.S. short- term rates were lower than those of other major countries and the U.S. curve was steep er.  By the beginning of 2005, and with the tightening cycle here already well along, the entire U.S. yield curve had shifted above the others, as shown in the middle panel.  Th at interest rate differential continued to widen during 2005, with the prospect for furthe r widening if futures markets in the G-7 are to be believed. Of course, all that tells us nothing about the future course of exchange rates.  Perhaps growth and interest rate differentials will continue to drive exchange markets.  Or perhaps the current account will fi nally hit some threshold where a sharp depreciation is trigge red.  Unfortunately, reviewing past relationships does not help answer that key question. Turning to page 3 for a closer look at recent monetary policy expectations in the G-3, the top panel graphs the 3-month cash rate for the dollar a nd euro—in the solid blue and red lines, respectively—and 3-, 6-, and 9-month forward rates in the dashed lines. This graph depicts the widening of differentials betw een dollar and euro interest rates during the year. But it also shows the re cent uptrend in rates in the euro area, as the ECB finally tightened by 25 basis points earlier this month—although that uptrend was contained by the ECB’s deliberate attempts to signal that this was not the first of a string of moves along the lines  of the U.S. cycle.  Short-term rates from fo rward-rate agreements for Japan, shown in the middle panel, suggest some backing off from earlie r expectations about how quickly the Bank of Japan [BOJ] would enter a new tightening cycle, with 9-month forward rates falling about 10 basis points over the intermeeting period.  Although the BOJ has signaled an intention to exit its quantit ative easing policy in the s econd quarter of 2006, there has been substantial push-back from politicians.   Furthermore, the BOJ itself has said explicitly that even after the exit from quantitative targeting, short-term rates would stay at or close to zero  for some time afterward. Despite actual or expected further tightening of monetary policies in many countries, risk appetite remains robust.  As shown at the bottom of page 3, stock the laggard. However, when converted into dollars, the returns on foreign markets are reduced, given the strength of the dollar;  and after that adjustment, the S&P’s performance looks a lot more like stock market performance elsewhere in the industrialized world. Emerging-market equity markets have been booming in local                5 of 100currency terms.  And for specific mark ets such as Brazil and Mexico—whose currencies have appreciated— returns expressed in dollars have been  turbocharged.    Turning to page 4 and continuing on the th eme of healthy risk appetites, the top panel graphs the high yield and EMBI+ [E merging Market Bond Index Plus] spreads for the year to date. High yield spread s have stabilized at around 380 basis points— higher than levels observed last spring but still low by historical standards.  In contrast, since the last FOMC meeting, emerging-ma rket debt spreads—the green line—have continued to tighten to all-time lows.    Investment grade spreads—in the middle left panel—show a similar pattern.  Excluding the troubled auto and airline industr ies, corporate financial health remains strong. Earnings and cash levels are both hi gh, and leverage is relatively low.  That said, a bit of re-lev eraging is in the pi peline, judging by the increasing flows in LBO deals and announced stock buybacks. The big credit story in November, of c ourse, was the worsened outlook for GM.  CDS [credit default swap] spreads for GM, shown in the middle right panel, are now trading about 1200 basis points over Libor, compared to just over 300 basis points for the high yield CDX index.  Near-term prospect s for GM have deteri orated significantly, so much so that the credit yield curve for GM  has inverted.  In other words, it is more expensive to buy credit protecti on against a GM default in the next 12 months, than it is to buy credit protection against a GM default over the next 5 years.  In addition, sellers of CDS protection on GM have started to  demand up-front payment from buyers of protection. They are “front loading” their coupon payments  of the swap because of fears that GM will default before they have received any payments from protection buyers. The worries about GM were likel y reinforced by yesterday’s announcement from Standard and Poor’s that it had downgraded GM to single B. Recent declines in volatility in both equ ity and debt markets reinforce this low risk concept and are consistent with the str ong risk appetite in markets.  While the VIX has shown some periodic spikes this year, the movements this year are very small compared to historical changes.  Fixed inco me volatility is also low, as shown in the bottom right panel.    Turning to page 5, let me say a few words about the System Open Market Account [SOMA]. The top panel graphs the growth of SOMA in dollar terms for each year since 1995. So far, SOMA has expa nded by a bit more than $25 billion in 2005— somewhat less than the growth in recent year s.  The main driver of SOMA’s growth is growth of currency in circul ation.  As shown in the middle panel, currency growth— again, measured in dollars—has been trailing off in recent years and is likely to have its weakest year of growth since the late 1990s .  We don’t know the cause of that falling growth rate, although greater use of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment may at least pa rtly explain this development.         6 of 100Looking at shorter periods, the bottom left panel graphs for 2005 the year-on­year growth rate for currency. Currency growth has decelerate d from a 5.5 percent growth rate at the beginning of the year to about 3.5 percent.  The noisy panel on the bottom right shows the growth of currency in  the year-end period for each of the past four years as well as this y ear through last week, with pr ojections for the remainder of this year in the burgundy dots. During the 2001 year-end—the blue line at the top— currency grew about 4 percent from November to the peak in late December before the reflows began. The following year the year-end seasonal bulge was less pronounced, and that pattern has continued in each year si nce.  Again, it’s not clear what is driving this process, but greater use of alternative forms of paymen t sounds reasonable.  In any case, the smaller hump in seasonal demand will, if it persists, make the management of reserves more straightforward in the future. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign operations by the Desk.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  With respect to your  yield c urves on page 2, implicit there are  three observations fr om which you could presumab ly get what you’re trying  to get at, namely, some  form of weighted interest  rate differential for the three obser vations.  These do move the exchange rate. What happens if you take this back in time?  Is there any explanatory power in this  relationship? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I didn’t look at it that  closely.  I suspect that if one looks at the relationship over a long enough peri od, probably not a whole lot.  That’s a suspicion. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRM

[SECTION]

AN GREENSPAN.  I thought we found approximately zero. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. This is a longstanding paradox in internationa l economics.  When you run uncovered interest parity and embod y the forward rate as the expected  future spot rate, you actually  get the coefficient with the wrong si gn in those regressions if the time  series is long enough.  And you never get it to confirm interest rate differentials related to exchange rates only in the positive direction and with the magnitude that you exp ected.  There are all sorts of reason s for that.  My s hort one is that you’re running two endogenous variab les on each other and, therefor e, the regression doesn’t make any sense, and so the resu lts don’t make any sense.            7 of 100CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, this  is a very interesting chart,  and I like the colors.  But what does it tell us?  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Well, there are ti mes when interest rate differentials seem to be the right story, and this is one of them. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I do su spect that the price of po rk bellies on occasion—  [Laughter]   

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. In defense of this  chart, let’s just say that th ere are also theo retical reasons why at times there is  this relationship. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Then there’s a ques tion of whether the th eory has any fact behind it. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  We need to believe in somethin g!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Anyway , let me move on to my  second question.  You mentioned with regard to the perfor mance of equity markets that on the bottom of page 3, if you took the S&P exchange-rate-adjusted, it would look more  like the rest.  But y ou already do that when you’re showing everything in U.S. dollar terms. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. That was my point.  I’m sorry, I was not clear.  My  point was that  the S&P looks as if it underperformed the others , but when you look at it in co mmon terms against the dollar, the S&P doesn’t quite look like the laggard that it does in loca l currency terms. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Ok ay.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. You commented on currency growth slowing down as a consequence of domestic issues, but  is it still true th at about half of our cu rrency is held abroad?  Probably a lot of it circulates in places like Russia that  have been unstable.  So, one explanation could be that there’s a               8 of 100growing stability in some of these areas th at have been heavy users of dol lars and that some of this currency may be flowing back .  That’s just a guess. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Yes, that’s a good poin t, and we’ve had that discussion  here in the past.  In fact, the estimates are that two-thirds of the cu rrency is overseas. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Two-thirds?  Okay. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. We have good data on shipments. The shipments data say that the currency is coming back.  What we don’t know is how much is go ing out by other means, whether legal or illegal, through things like remittances, for example.  If one looks at the othe r indicator that is used, which is the number of $100 bills issued , and makes some assumptions abou t how many of th ose go overseas, then that reflow from overseas is tamed.  It’s damped a bit. So I think there’s some tr uth to what you say, but it’s hard to quantify.  And in any case, the interesting thing about this bottom ri ght chart, at least, is  that it’s probably driv en mostly by domestic factors because there is evidence of the domestic ho liday fluctuation. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. In terms of the seasonal? MR. KOS. In terms of  the seasonal, yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN. I might add,  President Poole, that we do ma ke estimates of the growth rate of the domestic component as well as the growth rate of the foreign component.  According to our estimates, the deceleration over the past several years has occurred in both components.  But we estimate that grow th for the domestic co mponent would be about flat or slightly negative for this year for the first time in ma ny years—maybe ever—whe reas the foreign compon ent, according to our estimates, has slowed from  growth rates of around 9 percent earlier around the turn of the decade to a little less than 6 percent recently.  Of course, these estimates have to be taken with a big grain of salt for the reason Dino indicated.             9 of 100CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Further questions?  If  not, Vice Chair, would you kindly make the appropriate motion? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  So moved. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without objection, the transactions of  the Desk are approved.  Mr. Stockton. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the spirit of the season, I am tempted to report that I bri ng you great tidings of comfort and joy.  However, this is, after all, the Federal Reserve, so it is pr obably more appropriate to simply note that tidings have improved modestly over the in termeeting period.  Wh ile not quite in the miracle category, we have raised our projec tion for the growth of real GDP over the next two years and lowered our projection of price inflation. As you know, we revised up our estimate of the growth in real GDP in the third quarter by more than a percentage point and left fourth-quarter growth unchanged.  As a consequence, real output is now projected to expand at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent in the second half of this year—about ½ percentage point faster than we were forecasting in October. The surprising streng th in recent months has been widespread.  But clearly, one of the standout areas of strength has been consumer spending.  To be sure, sales of light motor vehicles were a bi t softer than we had expected, but that was more than offset by considerably stro nger consumer outlays in other areas. This morning= s retail sales report for November provided further evidence of the underlying strength in consumption.  Alt hough spending in the re tail control category, which excludes sales at auto dealers a nd building supply stores, dropped 0.6 percent last month, that decline was more than account ed for by lower gasoline prices.  In real terms, we estimate that spending was up more than 1 percent for the month.  That figure is somewhat stronger than we had expe cted and would likely cause us to revise up the growth of consumption nearly ½ percenta ge point at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. Business spending also has been  strong of late.  We are now projecting that growth in real spending on equipment and software w ill average 6½ percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year, an upward revisi on of nearly 3 percentage points from the transportation and tech sectors, where the incoming data on orders and shipments of capital goods suggest that the earlier lull in spending has e nded.  After being about flat in the first half, we are projec ting real outlays in this cate gory to rise 5 percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year .  As you know, we had been puzzled by that earlier weakness and had been anticipating a r ecovery of spending in  this category.  In the event, that recovery has occurred a b it earlier and with more  force than we had reckoned six weeks ago.          10 of 100In light of the 1 percentage point upward revision that we  made to real GDP growth in third quarter, it may appear a bit surprising that we only carried the higher level, and not a higher growth rate, into the fourth quarter.  But part of our upward surprise in the third quarter was in non-auto inventory investment.  With stocks appearing reasonably well aligned with sales in most sectors, we didn =t see the need to make any further upward adjustment to this aspect of the for ecast.  Moreover, some of the third-quarter strength in GDP reflected defense spending that seemed likely to have been pulled forward from the fourth quarter. Both of  these judgments appear to have been supported, and then some, by incoming data in the past two days.  Yesterday =s Monthly Treasury Statement and this morning’s readi ng on retail inventories suggest that both defense spending and inventory i nvestment are likely to be even weaker in the fourth quarter than we had written down. Balancing these softer readings against the stronger retail sales data would leave our forecast for real GDP growth in the fourth quarter unchanged at about 3½ percent. In contemplating the forecast for 2006 and 2007, we had to make some assessment of the sources of the strength in activity in the second half of this year.  As we had anticipated would be the case back in September, we are now in the position of having to interpret whether the errors in our forecas t of aggregate activity reflect misestimates on our part of either the hurri cane effects or of the underl ying behavior of the economy. We do believe that some of the surpri sing strength of activity is probably attributable to smaller negative effects from hurricanes than we had previously penciled in. To be sure, production in the energy sector is coming b ack a bit more slowly than we had expected, especially production from the off-shore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. But outside of energy, production appears to be recovering more quickly.  Output of chemicals, paper, rubber and pl astics, and some areas of food processing improved noticeably in October and November .  And we look to be getting a bigger plus from the production of construction suppl ies.  On the spending side, the hits to consumption of housing services, food, and gasoline—areas that we had thought would be affected by hurricane-related disruptions—a ppear to have been smaller over the past few months than we had incorporated in our  previous couple of forecasts.  Of course, most of this remains educated guesswork and needs to be taken with a grain of salt.  But all in all, we are inclined to attribut e a few tenths of the surprising strength in second-half growth to sm aller hurricane effects. We have interpreted the remainder of th e surprise as suggesting that underlying aggregate demand has been stronger at prevailing interest rates than  we had previously projected and that, all else equal, some of this strength will carry forward into next year. Spending receives a further boost in the projection from the upward revisions that we made to stock market and housing wea lth, which totaled about $1 trillion over the forecast period. All in all, it =s a stronger demand picture th an we were envisioning at the time of the last meeting.          11 of 100However, the information that we have received over the past six weeks has not been confined solely to aggregate demand.  Developments on the supply-side of the economy also appear to have been more favor able than we had expected.  The surge in output growth last quarter was accomplished wi th almost no increase in hours worked.  Consequently, output per hour in the nonfarm business sect or rose at a 4½ percent annual rate in the third quarter and is now  estimated to have been up more than 3 percent over the past four quarters. As op timistic as we have been, the data have continued to outflank us on th e upside in recent quarters. In response to this continued good news, we revised up our estimates of structural labor productivity. In addition to an upward adjustment to  the level this year, we boosted the growth of structur al labor productivity about ¼ percentage point to a bit above 3 percent in both 2006 and 2007. Capita l deepening is making a slightly larger contribution to this estimate, but most of the upward revision has occurred in multifactor productivity.  Despite being nearly  a decade into this favorable productivity wave, there are few signs that the efforts or abilities of businesses to implement greater technical and organizational efficiencies are flagging. On balance, the revisions that we made to aggregate demand were a touch larger than those we made to aggregate supply, and we estimate the output gap to be slightly narrower, on average, over the next two years than in the previous forecast.  In response to these developments, we raised our path fo r the funds rate anothe r 25 basis points, to 4½ percent by early next year. Despite these modest adjustments, the basic contour of our forecast remains unchanged. After increasing 3¾ percent this year, the rise in real GDP slows to 3½ percent in 2006 and 3 per cent in 2007.  That patter n reflects several powerful crosscurrents. We expect activity to be boosted early next year by rebuilding efforts in the Gulf Coast region. Moreover, with en ergy prices projected to level out after increasing sharply over the past two years,  the drag on aggregate demand from the earlier run-up in prices shoul d begin to ebb.  But these posit ives are more than offset by fading fiscal stimulus, the lagged effects of  tighter monetary policy, and a gradually diminishing impetus to consumer spending from equity and housing wealth. In sorting through the details of our forecast, it should be pretty obvious that a flattening out of activity in the housing sector is one of the principal sources of slower aggregate growth. After contributing about ½ percentage point to growth in real GDP per annum over the past four years, we ar e projecting residential investment to be a roughly neutral factor over the next two years.  But that is still all forecast. To date, the hard data on housing have remained solid.  Housing starts have remained at elevated levels, new home sales hit a record high in October, and house prices as measured by the OFHEO purchase index continued to increase at a double-digit pace through the third quarter. That said, reports of cooling in the housing markets seem to me to be more frequent and more widespread than was the case si x months ago.  As we noted in yesterday =s         12 of 100Board briefing, a variety of indicators of housing activity have turned down in recent months. Household attitudes toward ho me buying have dropped sharply; builder ratings of new home sales have deteriorated ; the index of mortga ge applications for home purchase has fallen off; and the inve ntory of unsold homes has moved up.  Taken in isolation, none of these measures has an es pecially reliable statis tical relationship to housing activity. But taken together, they c ould be indicating that we are at the front edge of some cooling in these markets. I offer one more piece of evidence that I thi nk almost surely suggests that the end is near in this sector. While  channel surfing the other ni ght, to the annoyance of my otherwise very patient wife, I came across a new television series on the Discovery Channel entitled “Flip That House.”  [Laughter] As far as I could tell, the gist of the show was that with some spackling, a few strategically placed azaleas, and access to a bank, you too could tap into the great real esta te wealth machine.  It was enough to put even the most ardent believer in market e fficiency into existen tial crisis.  [Laughter] Only time will tell if these indicators are giving us a head fake or are the start of our long-awaited slowdown in this sector. Fo r now, we are sticking with our call that housing activity will level off next year. Moreover, we continue to anticipate that a more visible deceleration in house prices will be in evidence by the middle of next year, and the associated slower growth of house hold net worth contributes to the projected up-tilt in the personal saving rate .  In our view, both of th ese developments are critical for damping growth by enough to prev ent the economy fr om overheating. To date, the news on inflation does not sugge st that we have ov ershot the mark on potential, though our ability to make that asse rtion with any confid ence in real time is admittedly very tenuous.  To begin, measures of core consumer prices came in a bit below our expectations. We also had a fast er unwinding of the ear lier hurricane-related increase in retail energy pr ices.  Survey measures of inflation expectations have retraced virtually all of this autumn =s run-up, and TIPS [Treasur y inflation-protected securities] -based m easures of inflation co mpensation have retreated as well.  On the cost side, lower hourly compensation and faster growth in structur al productivity imply less pressure from labor costs, and the mar kup of prices over unit labor costs has risen further, pointing to a somewhat larg er cushion between costs and prices. These developments led us to reduce our pr ojection of core consumer price inflation for 2006 by ¼ percentage point to about 2 pe rcent and to trim our forecast for 2007 a tenth to 1¾ percent.  The contour remains much the same.  We still are expecting a slight pickup in core inflation as we enter next year, refl ecting the direct and indirect effects of higher energy prices this year.  In that regard, the core PPI for intermediate materials increased 1¼ percent in both Septem ber and October, with  the price increases concentrated among goods that are heavily dependent on petroleum and natural gas.  And higher prices for these inpu ts as well as higher prices for transportation services seem likely to place some mild upward pre ssure on core inflation in the months immediately ahead.  Still, I think this for ecast is best characterized as one in which inflation pressures are in th e process of topping out rather than continuing to build.            13 of 100Obviously, there are some very important risks on both sides of our forecasts for real activity and inflation, a nd we tried to highlight some of the more prominent ones in the Greenbook.  I recognize that our baseline forecast, in which the economy =s growth slows to about trend, output settles out at a level very close to pot ential, and inflation pressures ease a bit, all with  just a little more tightening of policy, seems too good to be true. No doubt, events will conspire to force adjustments, both major and minor, on the staff projection. Perhaps I =ve just written the “flexibil ity and resilience” speech for the Chairman so often over the past few years that I= m suffering from something akin to the Stockholm syndrome—the tendency of hostage s over time to sympathize with the views of their keepers. [Laughter]  But as  I look back over the pa st year and observe how well the economy performed in the face of  some pretty substantial shocks, I don= t think our optimistic outlook is unwarranted. Karen will continue our presentation. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. This is the time of year when folks young and old look forward to receiving a pleasant surprise or two—and not necessarily something that can fit inside a single stocking. We in the International Division have found ourselves pleasantly surprised by the strength of global economic activity during the third quarter, which is now evident in the data, and the indications th at some of that stre ngth is continuing.  Accordingly, we have revised up our estimat e of foreign real GDP growth for 2005 to near 3½ percent, about the pace we were pr ojecting early last year.  The baseline forecast this time calls for economic activity ab road to continue expanding at about that pace through the end of 2007.   The greater-than-expected buoyancy of the global economy was widespread and does not appear to be explained by one or two special developments that have limited implications for future growth.  Among the industrial countries, the strong performers such as Canada had another good quarter, w ith Canadian Q3 real GDP growth at 3.6 percent. But more sluggish regions, for ex ample the euro area, also did moderately well, at 2.6 percent real grow th.  Labor markets have either continued to improve or remained solid.  And German and Canadian orders data portend continued solid expansion. Among the Asian emerging-market economies, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, the ASEAN countries, and India all performed well in the third quarter.  In Latin America, a sharp rebound in Mexican  GDP growth raised the average for the region despite a very w eak quarter in Brazil. Some elements of recent foreign activity do raise questions about whether strength is transitory or will prove more persistent.  In the United Kingdom and some smaller economies such as New Zealand, further increases in housing prices appear to be contributing to sustained or accelerating consum ption.  However, an end to the inflation of housing prices could tri gger a sharp slowing of cons umption.  Euro-area growth remains dependent on export demand and lack s support from domestic consumption.  And the rebound in Mexico was primarily in the agricultural sector  and did not include a significant bounceback in manufacturing.  Th ese factors suggest a transitory element             14 of 100in the recent data.  In contrast, in the ma jor regions of the global economy, inventories do not appear excessive and in need of re duction.  Private fixed investment has shown vitality in Japan, the euro area, the United Kingdom, Canada, China, and Mexico.  These elements suggest the expansion will prove durable. In most foreign economies, financial conditions remain very favorable for growth.  Equity prices, in particular, have risen s ubstantially over the year , providing support for both private investment and consumption.  Since the end of last  year, equity prices have recorded double-digit increases in the fore ign G-7 countries, with the more than 30 percent gain in Japan being particular ly noteworthy.  Among the emerging Asian countries, stock prices in Korea have surged  over the year.  In Latin America, Mexican and Brazilian stock prices have risen very  sharply.  Except for Canada, the major foreign industrial countries have all experienced expansionary depreciations of their currencies on balance over the year.  For these countries, long-term interest rates remain low, ranging from about 1½ percen t in Japan to 4¼ percent in the United Kingdom. We interpret the positive surprise in the pace of third-quarter activity as indicating somewhat greater fundamental economic mome ntum abroad than we recognized in the previous Greenbook. That momentum, in co mbination with the generally supportive foreign financial conditions, should sustain foreign real GDP growth, and we have accordingly raised our forecast for 2006 sli ghtly.  We expect that this continued moderate real output growth will be accompanied by little change, on average, in inflation abroad as the flat path projected fo r global crude oil prices over the forecast interval should result in some  shifts down in headline inflat ion.  Of course, risks of an acceleration in consumer prices  abroad, owing to second-round effects from previous oil price rises, remain.  Both the Bank of  Canada and the ECB raised policy rates during the intermeeting period to counter any up ward drift in inflation pressures or in inflation expectations. We e xpect further policy tightening in Canada in the next few quarters, more limited additional action by the ECB, and an end of the Bank of Japan =s policy of quantitative ea sing some time in 2006.   By itself, somewhat stronger activity abro ad should work to narrow our external deficits in 2006 and 2007.  But we have also slightly raised the forecast path for the dollar in this forecast from that in the October Greenbook, and the level of U.S. real GDP has been revised up as well. Together, these last two factors outweigh the effects of stronger activity abroad and, as a result, we expect a greater U.S. current account deficit during the next two years, with th e upward revision reaching about $50 billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2007. About $30 billion of the increased deficit is expected to be accounted for by a wider tr ade deficit, with the remaining $20 billion arising from a downward revision to net inve stment income.  Our outlook incorporates a deterioration of more than  $100 billion in U.S. net investment income from the second quarter of this year to the fina l quarter of 2007, with negative net income expected for the current quarter. With the current account deficit soon to reach $900 billion and projected to cross the $1 tril lion mark in 2007 and with net investment income significantly negative, market attent ion to the burden of the U.S. external                 15 of 100deficits could increase. This feature of th e December forecast is not such a pleasant surprise. Given today =s prices for energy, perh aps we would be better off with a lum p of coal. David and I would be happy to answer any questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. This is Comedy Central!  [Laughter]  I have the impression, and I don’ t know whether the hard data actually confirm it, that the emerging countries, adjus ting for policy, politics, history, what ever, seem to be doing a good deal better than one ordinarily projects.  The EMBI spread has continued to  come down through all sorts of developments.  We have the spectacle of the Mexicans  a couple of years ago or so being able to sell for the first time a long-term peso-denominated debt  instrument.  Brazil just sold one denominated in its domestic currency, and Co lombia did as well.  The Argentinean debacle never resulted in the really awful consequences that were supposed to occur th ere, and industrial pro duction is up sharply in Argentina despite all of their othe r problems.  Venezuela should be shutting its doors by now, granted what they’re doing there, but it’s not doing all that badly.  Is so mething fundamental happening that explains all of this? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Well, two or thre e things come to mind.  No one of them alone would seem to explain it, but in conj unction they may be a partia l answer to your question.  One is that following the Asian financial crisis, and no doubt in part in response to what has been  happening in the United States, particularly since say, ’9 5 or ’96, most of these countries have been running current account surpluses and acquiring inte rnational reserves.  The As ian countries have been doing it to the extreme.  They’ve been piling up re serves and protecting them selves from being depend ent upon th e whims of foreign investors ever since that cris is.  And they’re still doing it, although I noted an ar ticle in today’s Wall Street Journal  quoting some Chinese offici als as saying that maybe th ey now had enough.  So I took that to be an  interesting sign.          16 of 100The Latin American coun tries—for many of the same reasons, but w ithout quite the same capacity—have nonetheless put themselves in a position of an external plus in stead of a minus.  Now, the Latin Americans, in particular , and some of the Asians have ou tstanding debts, so they have payments schedules they  have to meet.  It’s not as if they are not in some  sense still embroiled in the consequences of their histories an d so forth.  But thei r position vis-à-vis gl obal capital flows has turned around enorm ously, and they have never gon e back to policies that reflect an attitude of “the crisis is over, full steam ahead.”  They have re tained this preference for keeping themselves net lenders in a flow sense in the inte rnational capital flow.  There are many reasons to view that as a problem as much as a good thing, but it explai ns, I think, why Argentina didn’t have much contagion effect and why these countries s eem to us to be doing better. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Is there considerably mo re exchange rate flexibility now? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Well, most of their exchange rates are floating, yes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Yes, that’s what I’m saying. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Yes. So very fe w are trying to peg to  an overvalued exchange rate.  Even a country like Malaysia gave up on  its pegged exchange rate.  So the floating rates have certainly improved the situation.  But,  you know, the peso and the real are strengthening vis-à-vis the dollar.  So it’s not mercantilist. It’s not that thes e countries have  somehow allowed thei r exchange rates to become and remain underval ued and that they are be nefiting from that.  But again, I think the flow changes the risk character of these countries and thei r ability to interact with international investors. I think a second fundamen tal is that Asia, largel y because of China but also because of India to some degree—because of the Asian Tigers, as  we used to call th em—has become a second independent source of vibrant global economic activity .  It was derailed a bi t in the late ’90s, but actually only a pretty short period elapsed before they were back on their feet.  And their capacity to           17 of 100succeed economically is very great.  They are a high-saving, hi ghly productive, strong work ethic part of the world.  And unless something happens to forest all that, they’re going to be an economic region that’s growing. And, third, they’re beco ming more market-based.  The ort hodoxy, so to speak—the increased reliance on markets, the additional flexibility, an d the more stable macro prices—is paying dividends in these regions as well.  You still get a countr y like Venezuela that, but for its oil reserv es, would be totally in some tank somewhere.  And its politics ar e leading it in crazy di rections, but it’s the exception at this point;  the others are more as  I’ve just described. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Well, th at’s actually a fairly encompassing explanation.  It implies that the lessons fr om 1998, when they were trying to fund in dollars  and lend in the domestic currency—trying to unwind the rules of accounting, which got them all into very serious trouble— have been learned, essentially. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. There are still shor tcomings, no doubt.  It’s sti ll the case that Asian market capitalism is not Anglo-Sa xon market capitalism.  An d China could still find that the enormous task it has set itself of changing that eco nomy at a very rapid pace could run into troubles .  These are not guarantees, but I thin k it’s in some sense a descri ption of where we’ve been.  And even all the shocks that we’ve all talked about so much—9/11, Enron, stoc k market collapses, et cetera—which were every bit as much global as they were U.S.-only, have been absorbed remarkably well, not only here but abroad. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  David, could you give us a risk assessment  on your consumer spending forecast?  In 2006 and 20 07, you have consumer spending growth of 3½ pe rcent, while the housing         18 of 100with that forecast?  You made reference to it in the formal comments, but I wonder if you are quite comfortable with the forecast or  a little uncertain about it. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Well, I’m certainly uncertain ab out it.  [Laughter] There’s no doubt about that. But I actually see some risks on both sides of that forecast.  On the upside, we are banking on a rather steep increase in the savi ng rate over the next two year s.  If our large-scale quarterly econometric model wants to extend the surprisingly  low saving rate that we’ve seen over the past couple of years forward into the future, that sugges ts the possibility of a grea ter step-up in consumer spending.  So there is some upside risk. On the downside, some of  the step-up that we have in consumption over the ne xt two years is related to our forecast of an accelerat ion in compensation pe r hour, which, thus far, has remained very low. And if we don’t ge t that step-up in compensation growth , we’re not going to have the labor income immediately to support this pickup in cons umer spending going forw ard.  And I think that constitutes an import ant downside risk. So I feel comfortable th at we have the risks reasonably well  balanced, but there are some big question marks, I think, on the co nsumption forecast going forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I want to go back to the conversati on with Karen.  It seems to me that it would be helpful in the Greenbook to ha ve much more analysis of the cap ital account than we do.  In the Greenbook Part 1, there’s a brief mention—you repeated it now—of the growing current account deficit.  And I think we all unders tand that things that can’t go on  forever won’t.  But on the other hand, we might be able to have an idea as to so me growing tensions there if we understood more about what’s going on with direct  investment and, say, how much of the capital flow is simply passively financed by governments  that are pegging their exchange  rates, like China and others.                19 of 100There is definitely not much analytical material on the in ternational capital account.  So I would have a suggestion for more information there because the capital flows so  dominate the shorter-run effects.  A particular question in that context is:  How much of the strength of the dollar this year might we attribute to the special tax break for this year? Certainly, corporations have been moving capital back into the Un ited States.  I don’t know quantit atively how impo rtant that is. I also have a suggestion for Da vid.  Looking ahead, the major share of GDP growth is going to be from the supply side of the economy.  We’re at close to full employment .  And if you look at the Greenbook, the analysis there is very heavily weight ed toward an understandin g of demand factors. By my calculation there is, at least in one place, a half page on produc tivity in the labor market.  But I think as we look ahead, we need  a deeper understanding of the de terminants of such things as structural productivity growth and labor force partic ipation.  So I would make  a plea for beefing up that section of the Greenbook Part 1. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. Just as a quick answer, we have put assumpti ons into the Gr eenbook about the size of those capital flows, as a financing of our  deficit.  They don’t in fluence the current account because the earnings on U.S.  investments abroad are booked as oc curring on a flow basis—when they happen—whether they are repatriated or not.  So the repatriation in light of this special tax break that will ultimately expire would be a financing flow, not a change to the curre nt account.  And probably the numbers are big enough to be meaningful but not huge, not dominant. What we don’t know—probably ca n’t know—is the extent to wh ich the flows back to this country are already in dollars in some sense.  Are they earned in do llars or are they transferred into dollars over some long peri od of time?  If they are so rt of sitting there waiting to come back  in dollars, they wouldn’t have any particular ro le in explaining, say, the run-up  in the dollar over the last six months or so.  Without very disaggregated data, we can’ t really tell that.  An d the turnover in the           20 of 100exchange market is so huge that  numbers on the order of magnit ude that this tax break involved would never show up as a sudden outlier in a particular month, or something of that  sort.  We’ve put something in there as an a ssumption, and it’s probably a piece of the story.  It’s  providing a little bit of extra ease in financing the current account deficit right now and is, therefore, a bit of support for the dollar.  But I wouldn’t th ink it is a dominant factor. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. My plea, obviously , is not so much about that specific event, but about the analysis of the capital account in  general, because I think it rea lly does make a difference how much of the capital flow is direct inve stment.  And what’s go ing on there I think is very important for understanding— 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I certainly don’t dispute that it is us eful to know things like the amount of private versus official financing, an d the nature of some of the flows, and so forth.  Bu t let me caution you that, in the end, the actual data recorded for cap ital flows will conform to  the current account balances. There are certain market  equilibria that imply certain id entities.  So the fact that the numbers are what they are isn’t so important.  What matters are the terms on wh ich those flows occur.  So things like exchange rates, inte rest rates, and equity prices will tell you the characteristics of the returns to assets that had to be realized in orde r to get the flows to be what the flows had to be. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  We will certainly take on board your recomm endation to expand more of our analysis of the aggregate supply  side.  I would just say that this  is an area where, in the past several years, we have made very significant ch anges in the underlying st ructure of the way we’ve produced the forecast.  We presen t a great deal more detail in te rms of the composition of the aggregate supply side of our forecast than we were doing five or six years ago.  So I think we’ve taken steps in that direction.            21 of 100I would also caution, just a bit, against page co unting for judging the amount of analysis of the supply side.  To get to output, we’v e got to go through all the various pieces of the spending side to get there.  I hope in my remarks this morning I made it cl ear that we were interpreting much of the news that we’ve recei ved about spending to  have supply-side implicatio ns and that the information should not be taken just as  a feature of aggregate de mand.  But we certainly sh are your desire to have a better and more thorough understand ing of what is happening on th e supply side of  the economy, because it has proven over the last decade to be a very important source of  macroeconomic variation. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Very quickly, on th e Chairman’s question to Karen.  Clearly, there is virtue to massive competition.  My most delicious  irony is the fact that similarly dated Vietnamese debt now trades on a price basis richer, and on a yield ba sis lower, than that of  Ford Motor Company. [Laughter]  It wasn’t too long ago that we were k illing each other.  But we do have, increasingly, an independent central bank in Mexico.  We have bett er reporting techniques in  Brazil.   And I would submit that while it may not be An glo-Saxon capitalism, part of this is just a matter of realizing the value of capital and the desire to attract capital.  Mo reover, the improving at-home conditions make many of these countries increasing ly attractive as an alternative.   And the competition is good. My question is to David, and maybe Brian or  others.  I wonder if  you could—not now but with some kind of briefing or a paper at some po int—give us a sense abou t the issue you mentioned of the lags in the effects of monetary policy tightening.  I’m curious about the dynamics in a tightening scenario such as the FOMC has been purs uing here.  How do you calculate the impact and the likely lag time interv als in the progressive process that we’v e been going throug h as opposed to a one-time shock?  I assume that your  models include a dynamic.  I’d li ke to understand it better, and            22 of 100maybe some of my other colleagues w ould as well.  So it’s not a question to be answered now, but if you’d be kind enough to do that, I’d be  grateful.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Well, at the risk of going back into a discussion that I think President Santomero began and President Poole pi cked up on, I was struck by the sl ow pace of hiring that is in your projection.  You have job gains going from 85,000 a mo nth in the second half  of next year to 50,000 per month in 20 07.  Having come through the last thr ee or four years, numbers like that in monthly employment data wo uld be cause for concern,  and yet we still have gr owth not that far below potential.  We have structural productivity growing, a narrowing of the output gap, and unemployment staying about stable—the difference be ing this rise in compensation per hour creating enough income to support the dema nd side of it.  You probably have talked enough about this but I found that slowness in the pace of hiring a little disturbing after what we’v e been through.  And I wondered what your thoughts were about it.  Maybe I’m just asking the same question  that Tony was asking in terms of the risks to consumer spending. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Well, I’l l just add a couple of  further comments th at relate to your concerns. One is that, gi ven our forecast of labor force participation—which is pretty mild, as you know—we think you sh ould be lowering your sights as to what the underlying trend employment growth would be on the establishm ent survey.  We’re now putting that at roughly 90,000 a month, so that— 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. To keep pace with the growth in the labor force. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. To keep pace with our slight downward trend in labor force participation.  So if we’re right about that—and as you know, there is considerable  uncertainty about that piece of the forecast—then you’re going to have to start thi nking of 90,000 as a pret ty good number.  Now,            23 of 100we’re actually able to ma nage above 90,000 over the course of the next several months and into next year, in part because we do think labor force particip ation is still be low its trend.  And as we move back toward trend, we can get growth in overal l payroll employmen t at a little above trend.  So we don’t really see the eventual slowing of employment gains as signa ling a significant weakening in the labor market. But we do have growth a bit below tren d further out when GDP  growth drops a little below potential.  So that’s al so an element of  the forecast. Now, you’re right in some sense.   If that were to occur in th e context of gains in compensation per hour that are roughly equal to what we’ve had, rather than the step-up that we’re projecting, we’re going to have a shift in income distribution towa rd capital income and aw ay from labor income. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Right. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  And we think th at shift would have a small negative effect for aggregate demand.  The negative effect is not as big as you might imagine because, obviously, to the extent that the income distribution is going toward capital, the stock market would be strong, so the wealth effects on consumption woul d be a little larger or capital spending  would probably be stronger.  Still, if we’re wrong about this piece of the forecast, I think it goes in the direction that things could be a bit weaker in terms of overall spending  by 2007 than we’re forecasting. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. Yes. I wo ndered about that as a downside risk.  The numbers jumped out at me, even recognizing your take on la bor force participat ion.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker. MR. LACKER.  I share President Poole’s longing for more unde rstanding of the productivity forecast. My understanding  is that what you call “s tructural” is essentially a moving average.  I’m interested for this forecast, since there is such a big markup in that , to know the exte nt to which the                 24 of 100average that had some recen t upside data come into it.  And the description about how you’ve altered your forecast included a reference to  a technical factor that I think we nt over my head .  Can you help us with that? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I’d be happy to, if you’re re ally willing to liste n to it!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. If it’s too much, we could do it offline.  An d more broadly, I’m interested in understanding the framework you have for forecasting this.  It ’s not clear how that works.  If there is a memo or paper that you could refe r me to that laid ou t all the machinery, I’ d really appreciate it. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. We’d be happy to do that as well.  In principl e, the upward revision in our forecast for structural productivity growth this time  was due to two factors.  One was that productivity was a lot stronger than we thought.  But it wasn’t just that productivity was stronger; so it’s not just this moving-average error term.  It’s also the fact th at we’re at a point in the business cycle, with labor would be running a little  below trend.  So our prev ious estimate of the trend of  2¾ percent, with actual productivity growing 3 percent, implied that produc tivity was being driven even further above trend.  And in our underlying model, in wh ich there is a cyclical and a trend component to productivity, that didn’t really seem sensible to us at this point, given that we think labor markets are close to balance. We arrived at that view not just from looking at the employment rate  but at plenty of other indicators of labor market activity, which sugg ested to us that the underlying structural trend in productivity probably has been faster than we thought.  So we narrowed that  tension by rais ing structural productivity rather than continuing to forecast that actua l productivity was going to slow back toward our trend.  I think that’s the principal s ource of that element in the forecast. Now, as far as the technical factors go—I’ll be very brief he re—our analysis of structural productivity uses nonfarm busine ss output and hours as measured  from the establis hment survey.               25 of 100Potential GDP is a measure of output measured using GDP—not output in the nonfarm business sector—and hours from the house hold survey—not the establishment survey.  So there are two technical factors that tend  to account for the wedge: the output growth in the nonfarm business sector versus GDP, and the growth in ho usehold hours versus establishm ent hours.  And both of those factors have been significantly negative over the cour se of the last several ye ars.  That is, output, as measured by GDP, has been slower than nonfarm business output.  And growth in hours, as measured by the household survey, has been considerably stronger than in the establishment survey. So you need both of those factors,  in essence, to reconcile struct ural productivity and potential output.  That is why you might be puzzled as you look at the for ecast wondering: Gee, they’ve got 3 percent structural productivity but only 3¼ percent growth in potential GDP.  But, in fact, that’s the way we do that element of the analysis.  We’re more  or less forced into that particular position. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER.  Okay.  If I could ju st follow up for a se cond: In the la te ’90s, your forecast of productivity growth seemed to display a cyclica lity—almost a responsivene ss to recent productivity growth—that in hindsight took it up above where productivity growth  came in and th en down below it. Are you worried about the sensitivity of your forecast to recent data? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Well, the answer to that question is yes.  [Laughter]  But ac tually I’m not terribly worried that we’re doing that in this ki nd of filtering, which uses  the structural model and some statistical filters.  We ar e downweighting the most recent observations because they haven’t been through annual revisions.  An d there are plenty of reasons for thinking that the information content in that third-quarter GDP number is not as large as the information content of productivity measured in 2003.  So we try to accoun t for that as well. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Okay. I didn’ t realize that.  Thanks.               26 of 100CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Any further questions?  If not, before we do the roundtable, let me reiterate something that I thin k has been communicated—namely, that  Brian is going to discuss in some detail some of the back and forth that has been occurring here in recent days on the language of the statement. So please abst ain from commenting on the statement in the firs t round until Brian has made his comments.  Given that, have I discoura ged anybody?  [Laughter]  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  We’re a resilie nt group, Mr. Chairman.  [Laughter] We don’t get discouraged easily. Developments in the Seventh Di strict have been mixed.  The data released since our last meeting indicate that ma nufacturing expanded at  a moderate pace, whil e housing slowed and employment continued to be weaker than the national  economy.  That said, our contacts seem to be more upbeat.  We continue to h ear reports of labor markets beco ming tighter, leading to potential wage pressure.  One of the nationa l temporary help firms in our Di strict mentioned that they are increasingly unwilling  to guarantee their clients an hourly wage rate for the en tire year.  Another indicated that entry-level wages ar e going up 3 to 4 per cent but that at the mi d- to upper-skill level wages are rising 5 to 7 percent. So I want to discuss tw o notable restructuring st ories that point to the flexibility of the U.S. economy, albeit with government presence, notably on  the pension front.  One is United, which is at the end game, and the other involv es GM and Delphi, which is ju st beginning.  United’s CEO is optimistic about their prospects, as they expect to exit fr om bankruptcy in February.  Their business has continued to improve, and forward bookings s uggest that strength should persist in the coming months.  United is gaining market share, while the industry overall is reducing capacity.  Having unloaded their pension liabilities on the PBGC and restructured their labo r contracts and other contracts, they expect to be ab le to compete with th e low-cost carriers, such as Southwest.           27 of 100Incidentally, the CEO of United ad mitted to me that Ned Gramlich was right.  He said that Ned’s position on federal loans forced Un ited to do it the right way and to get the needed co ncessions from workers, suppliers, and creditors, and assistance from the PBGC. Turning to the auto industry, as I mentioned last time, Delp hi’s bankruptcy could result in some meaningful restructuring of labor contracts.  Bu t there is a significant risk  of a strike that could seriously disrupt the auto industry, particularly General Motors.  The negot iations are at a delicate point with three key players—Delphi, the UAW, and GM.  Approximately 15 to 20 percent of GM’s parts come from Delphi, and GM has provided some  guarantees to the De lphi workers for their pensions and health care benefits.  Clearly, the UAW is in a difficult position.  A strike could well cause Delphi to close its U.S. operations and reemer ge as an international firm with a far smaller union workforce.  A prolonged strike  at Delphi could also hobble GM.  In a wors t-case scenario, this could force GM into bankruptcy, which would hurt the UAW workers at both GM and at Delphi.  As a result, all three parties have a strong incentive to avoid a strike. There have been some positive signs.  Delphi has postponed the de adline for an  agreement from December 16th to at least January 20th, and GM has given so me concessions to Delphi on prices.  In my conversations with Rick Wagoner,  the CEO of GM, he felt  that while a lot of antagonistic public statements have been made, the most likely outcome was th at sanity would prevail and a strike would be aver ted.  But to avoid a stri ke, all three parties must throw something into the pot.  And he could not rule out so me wildcat strikes at individual Delphi plants.  Of course, a settlement here does not so lve GM’s longer-ter m problem, which is loss of market share.  And, as Dino mentioned, S&P downgraded GM’s corpor ate debt—not GMAC, but their corporate debt— again yesterday by two notches.            28 of 100In terms of the near-term outlook for auto sales, the consensus of  28 forecasters at our recent annual economic outlook symposium was for a small decline in sales in 2006 fro m this year’s expected pace of 16.9 m illion units.  GM and Dai mlerChrysler’s forecasts we re in line with this expectation, but Ford’s intern al forecast is c onsiderably lower, at 16½ million units. Turning to the national outlook, ec onomic activity continues to grow at a solid pace.  Like the Greenbook, we see growth at  or slightly above trend over the next  two years, and this  is also roughly in line with the co nsensus from our outlook symposium. The prospects for inflation present greater risk s.  There are two plau sible scenarios going forward.  In the first one, the in creased energy costs in 2005 lead to a transitory increase in core inflation in ’06, but in ’07 core inflation comes back down.  This is the Greenbook baseline scenario.  In the second scenario, the increase in core inflation is mo re persistent, in part because there is less slack in the economy in 2006.  Furthermore, monetary policy has been accommod ative for a long time and there has been an accumu lation of liquidity which ultimately  could show through to higher nominal spending.  For these reason s, both inflationary pressures an d inflationary ex pectations could remain elevated for longer than envisioned in the first scenario. Our statistical forecasts,  based on the Stock-Watson methodol ogy, are more in  line with the second, less optimistic scenario.  Both scenarios are plausible, but the costs of the second one are higher. So from a risk management perspective, we need to put adequate weight on the second scenario. This may requir e more tightening next year than assu med in the Greenbook .  But at this point, we just don’t know.  Conseq uently, we should make sure that  the statement does not give a premature signal that we’re near the end of the ti ghtening cycle.  But, as you requested, Mr. Chairman, I’ll hold off further comments on the statem ent until the second round. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.   Thank you.  President Hoenig.         29 of 100MR. HOENIG.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I’d describe the outlook for the U. S. economy as solid, as the Greenbook has described it.  Obviously, several factors contribute to this, including the forward momentum that’s in th e economy, the lagged effects of past monetary accommodation (which we’ve talked about in the past), very supportive financial conditions, and stim ulative fiscal policy. I would say that the evidence from  the Tenth District is consiste nt with this broader outlook as well, but we also are seeing some slowing in certain areas.  Energy ac tivity in our area continues to expand at a very substantial pace .  There is still a shortage of workers to support some of the expansion that’s being sought.  Manufacturers remain  upbeat about future activity and plan increases in capital spending over the next six months.  In addition, consumer sp ending, after dropping following the hurricanes, has rebou nded solidly in our region.  Howeve r, there is the point that David mentioned about housing activity, wh ich does appear to be leveling  off in our region.  And while manufacturing activity continues to expand, it is at a somewhat slow er pace.  I would make note of the fact that we also are being a ffected by some of the GM issues, since GM is closing its plant in Oklahoma City and that will idle about 2,400 workers. Turning to the inflation outlook, I expect core CPI inflation to be in the area of 2.3 percent next year, as higher energy  prices pass through to hi gher overall core inflation and as the effects of our past accommodative policy show through.  However, I expect that th e increases may be temporary, as productivity growth remains strong  and as energy prices recede from  where they have been, if that continues. Nevertheless, I still would ex pect the inflation num ber to be in the 2 percent or slightly higher range.            30 of 100But that said, I think there continues to be a good case for further tightening at today’s meeting.  Beyond that, I wo uld say it is less certain, as Michael said, and I think in our statement the matter should be couched in the near term.  And I’ll stop there as  well.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn.

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  First, let me shar e a few thoughts on what we’re seeing in our Southeast region.  Ov erall, growth in our District cont inues at an acceptable pace, with most of the data and most of th e anecdotal reports from directors and other contacts being positive across almost all sectors. Recovery from the hurricanes is proceeding about  as we expected, althou gh it’s hard to track all related economic activity, as many residents are still living in—a nd many businesse s still operating from—the new cities to which they fled.  Businesses in the affected areas that are open are now reporting brisk sales of autos and clothing, as belongings destroyed by the storm are replaced. Economic activity for majo r rebuilding and replacement of housi ng-related durables has not really started in any significant way.  And if there is any new realization about  the timing of th at, it is that the rebuilding process—and consequently the ec onomic impact—will be considerably more protracted than I first thought.  It will probably be a process of five years or  more.  Almost half of electricity and telephone custom ers in the area still have no t had those serv ices restored. Since we last met, there have also been more and more fre quent reports of a definite chill in the residential construction activity and speculation in the frenzied coas tal real estate markets.  While that is yet to show through in any convinci ng way in regional and national  statistics, those reports of a measurable shift in attit ude and activity are comi ng from lenders, develo pers, and real estate salespeople.        31 of 100Perhaps most relevant to th e near-term policy consideratio ns, we’re still ge tting numerous reports of price pressure s and determination to tr y to relieve those pressures by passing through the added costs.  At our meetings last week, two di rectors from large national companies described what they characterized as new windows of opportunity to get price incr eases—windows they have already jumped through and gotten significant price increases that are stic king.  They reported that even their tough customers, like the Wal-Marts of the world, had accepted those in creases.  It was also reported that while regular gasoline prices have come down, prices of diesel fuel had declined relatively less.  And while some rollback of fuel surcharges may be occurring, that is not yet evident. Finally, on a regional level, early holiday sales are reported to be satisfactory.  And our director who is chief financial offi cer of UPS reported that deliveries  are running above plan at this point. Yet there is a realization th at tracking total holiday  sales may be more difficult than ever, as consumers shift their bu ying patterns from tr aditional, more easily  measurable stores to a larger use of the Internet for purchases. I also find the new information since our last meeting on the national fr ont encouraging.  The latest numbers on third-quarter GDP were a bit better than I expect ed and describe wh at I, too, would characterize as a solid expansion.  We seem to  have good balance acro ss sectors.  While it’s reasonable to expect some marginal change in the mix of activity as we move into next year, I expect more of the same in 2006. While the significant fallback in  oil prices from their recent highs, the continuing strong competitive pressures, and the robust productivity  gains have all worked to  constrain inflationary pressures, it’s my  judgment that we could still  see a rise in inflation as businesses continue to try to recoup their higher input costs.  And leaning against th ose potential pressures should be our priority, at least for now.            32 of 100Against that backdrop, I would ar gue that by some measures our current policy setting, at least going into this meetin g, is still accommodat ive.  And whether we choose to desc ribe it as such in our statement, I favor staying on our po licy path at least a b it longer.  I think I look forward to our later discussion of what the statement should say.   [Laughter]   Than k you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, Texas and the Elev enth District are even more surprisingly strong than the surprisingly strong rest of the United States.  We see gr owth in retail sales and manufacturing employment, strength  in housing starts, an d high occupancy rates.  Houston is 100 percent occupied in terms of apartments, as part  of the resultant fallou t from President Guynn’s District.  In every single dimension, the Eleventh District economy is solid. There is price seepage from natural gas and ot her products.  The most alarming wi ll be utility bills, which are expected to  jump by 40 percent next  year.  But what is take n from Peter often goes into Paul’s pocket or, as we say, what is taken from Pedro goes into Pablo’s pockets in Texas.  And the best example I can give you is  from the CEO of American Airlin es, who told me yesterday that their fuel bill ov er the last two years has incr eased $3 billion.  As he put it, “The bloo d is being sucked out of me, and it’s going to our frie nds down the street.”  In this instance, that is literally the case because Exxon is a couple of blocks away down th e street.  In terms of our local economy, this is healthy for us because we’re  energy neutral.  In the activity surr ounding energy, the ri g count is up 23 percent this year.  Energy company profits are soaring, as I referred to  earlier.  Oil royalty streams and mineral rights holdings are expected to rise dramat ically, so we have a wash as far as energy prices are concerned.  The bottom line is that Texas is a ve ry happy place, the Eleventh District is a very happy place, and our economy is strong.  And it  shows you the dynamic nature of our country.               33 of 100Nationally, both the Gr eenbook and anecdotal evidence indica te that the economy is equally solid. We see it in the re tail sales data, as David reported today.  But one of the aspect s of those retail sales numbers, according to our interlocutors at the big box distributors, is that less than half the goods sold in what they call th e “November frenzy” were deeply disco unted goods.  In other words, the sales were solid. I spoke to sixteen CEOs and CF Os in preparing for today.  I basically heard only one new concern, Mr. Chairman, which go es back to the point that Karen was making earlier about globalization.  Also, I want to point out that  one of the big homebuild ers—Hovnanian—confirmed what you said, Davi d.  As he put it: Investors—meaning speculators— are exiting the business and it is returning to normal.  But the common concern coming from the reta ilers, the rails, th e shippers, the shipbuilders, and so on, wa s the following:  Everyone  I’ve talked to continues to try to figure out ways to exploit globalization.  Each of them, from th e IT [information technol ogy] guys to the big box retailers to the specialty chemical firms to the service firms, wants to have offshore supply.  One of the CEOs said, “We have a long way to go in explo iting China.”  We’ve heard that forever.  And one of my favorites was the comment, “China, India, a nd Indonesia can make Italian ceramics better than Italians can now or could 20 0 years ago.”  [Laughter] The problem that I’m beginning to hear seepin g into the conversation, Mr. Chairman, has to do with U.S. infr astructure.  If you read the New York Times  article two days ago about Shanghai’s new deep water port, you have to realize that those facilities are being built  to ship goods out of China, not so much to ship  goods into China.  And consider this, as report ed by one of the shippers I spoke with: 50 percent of all the ships on order for construction are container ships.  Capacity-expanding container business is increasing at 15  percent or more per an num to carry cargo from Shanghai and other parts of th e world to the United States.        34 of 100Now, this is good news on the disinflationary front.  As the CEO of Northern Navigation, one of the larger shippers to ld me, “Transportation by ship will essentiall y be free when these numbers are realized in the marketplace.”  The bad news is stateside.  We don’t have the cap acity to absorb it.  Long Beach and the Northwest harbor s are constrained.  Wo rk rules, according to our interlocutors, are very slow to adju st.  But there are ways  to beat the bottlene cks, and I just want  to mention two.  UPS reports that they ha ve gone from 6 to 18—a nd now for next year 21—f lights from China.  Wal-burden from Long Beach.   But it is evident that the enemy is us  as far as exploiting globalization, and I think that’s a long-term pr oblem that we might want to  take note of over time. Presently, I argue that the economy is solid.  We have very good gr owth.  I’m s till a little worried about inflation, but I’m co nvinced that we’re nipping it in the bud by the action of the FOMC and that we might want to pause so oner rather than later.  But, ag ain, we might discuss that in the discussion of the statement.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Yellen. 

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Incoming data since our last meeting have been quite encouraging.  Economic grow th over the next few quarters sh ould be boosted by rebuilding and the full return of energy producti on in the Gulf.  As rebuilding wi nds down and the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening take hol d, it seems plausible that growth will slow toward potential, keeping unemployment arou nd the current level of 5 percent,  the scenario envisioned in the Greenbook. The economy’s remarkable resilie nce in the face of devastatin g hurricanes and three years of rising energy prices suggest that  the expansion has gain ed footing and no longer needs support from monetary policy accommodati on.  Instead, a key issue facing us  over the next few meetings is            35 of 100whether policy might actually  need to move to a rest rictive stance in order to  forestall inflationary pressures. I will therefore focus my attentio n on the factors affecting the in flation outlook.  To do that, we need to look first at the here  and now and remind ourselves that recent readings on core prices have consistently come in at or below expectations.  There are no sign s of acceleration.  In fact, core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price infl ation has slowed over th e past year; the most recent reading of 1.8 percen t over the past twelve months is down 0.3 from the preceding year.  And the downward inflation trend has continued through this year, with co re PCE inflation running at only 1.6 percent over the past six mont hs, which is about the middle of my preferred range.  Of course, even though recent core inflation da ta look pretty darn good, there ma y be forces at work that could undermine price stability.  In my remaining remarks, I’d like to comment on some  factors that could push inflation higher and consider their likely effects in the current situation. The first risk to price stability is that, contra ry to the Greenbook fo recast, growth may not actually subside toward potential.  So labor an d product markets could tighten further, pushing unemployment below NAIRU, which current estimates place around 5 percent.  This possibility is illustrated in the stronger aggregate demand  scenario in the Gr eenbook.  That si mulation shows that monetary policy would, of course, need to tighten.  But the inflation consequenc es would be modest, given a reactive Taylor rule monetary policy response.  So to deal with this risk, it seems to me that policy need not be preemptive. A sustained slowdown in produc tivity growth would pose a more challenging dilemma for policy and the inflatio n outlook.  Fortunately, howe ver, productivity growth over the past year has not slowed.  Quite the contrary, it has be en surprisingly robust.  Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector grew more than 3 percent over the past y ear, beating out previous estimates of structural         36 of 100productivity growth of around 2¾ pe rcent.  As I discussed at our meeting a year ago, I think there are compelling reasons why productivity growth may well  remain elevated for so me time, havi ng to do with the gradual diffusion of new technologies an d workplace practices th roughout the economy.  Therefore, I concur with the staff’ s conclusion that the accumulated ev idence indicates that structural productivity growth is around 3 percent and with the corresponding up ward revision in  the outlook for actual productivity.  Given the sluggish adjustment of wages to cha nges in productivity , the stronger path of productivity reduces the rate of growth of unit labor costs, putting downward pressure on inflation.  So productivity  trends suggest a tempering of inflatio nary pressures, not an intensification. Energy prices also pose a potential threat to in flation.  But as I argued a few meetings back, the empirical evidence does not support significant pass- through of energy prices into core inflation.  I won’t repeat those arguments today but simply note,  once again, that core PCE inflation has actually moderated, despite a nearly 30 per cent increase in energy  prices over the past year, on top of a 15 percent rise in the previous year.  Moreover, ener gy prices on the whole have come down sharply of late, and, therefore, the risk of significant pass-t hrough to core inflation has moderated as well.   In addition, it appears that the Fed’s credibility  has held up well this year, despite the supply shocks associated with higher energy prices and hu rricanes.  Survey measures  of longer-run inflation expectations are about where they stood before the storms.  Longer-r un inflation expectations based on Treasury securities have  come down about ¼ perc entage point since the last FOMC meeting and are now below levels of a year ago. Finally, it’s possibl e that wage growth could accelerate, putting up ward pressure on the growth of unit labor costs and inflat ion.  And, indeed, the Greenbook forecast projects exactly such an acceleration, reflecting lagged pass-through of earlier increases in both energy prices and productivity into wages. In particular, the Greenbook forecasts that hourly co mpensation, as me asured by the           37 of 100employment cost index,  will increase 4.2 percent in 2006, following a 3 per cent gain this year.  It projects an even larger—1.7 percentage point—ac celeration in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector. To gauge the likelihood of  such an acceleration in compen sation, my staff examined the pass-through of energy prices and produc tivity into wages.  They used forecasting models in which wage inflation is determined by lagged  wage inflation, price inflatio n, productivity growth, and the unemployment rate.  Now, it  turns out that when  the sample period used in  the analysis includes the 1970s, our empirical work finds clear evidence of pa ss-through from energy prices into compensation.  But when the samp le begins in the 1980s, pass-through effect s from energy prices  to compensation are dramatically weaker or insignificant.  This result is consistent with the finding I reported previously.  There is no real evid ence that energy prices pass throug h to core consumer  inflation since the early 1980s.  With respect to  the pass-through of productivity gr owth into compensation, our staff finds evidence of only very gradual pass-through regard less of the sample period.  Going forward, our models predict significantly less increase in comp ensation growth than th e Greenbook over the 2006­2007 forecast horizon.  We conclude from this empirical work that an increase  in inflation due to a sharp acceleration in compensation growth is, at most, an upside risk to inflation and not the most probable outcome. I opened my remarks by noting that a key issue facing us over the next fe w meetings is whether policy needs to move to a restrictive stance in  order to forestall infla tionary pressures.  While we must obviously remain vigilant  and respond to developments that threaten price stability, the evidence that we have at this time, in my opinion , points to relatively low an d stable inflation going forward.  Moreover, history teaches us that it is  not easy to foresee the po int at which past policy            38 of 100tightening takes hold and th e economy reaches a turning point.  Therefore, it’s important that we keep the lags of monetary policy actions in mind in our deliberations and not go too far.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you very  much, Mr. Chairman.  I th ink a fair reading of New England’s economy is that it continues to be a bit w eaker than the nation’s as a whole.  To be sure, this sense is skewed by  conditions in Mass achusetts, which al one accounts for ab out half of the region’s employment.  Nonfarm em ployment declined again in Octo ber after a somewhat bigger drop in September, softening the region’s year-over-year jo b growth rate to about half of the nation’s as a whole. But Massachusetts accounted for more th an the recent net losses, with job gains in all of the other states acting to offset drops in the Bay Stat e.  Other indicators of st ate health show similar patterns.  In particular, the Philadelphia Fed’s coincident index shows growth in Massachusetts flattening while growth in the ot her five states is accelerating. A question one could as k, and one that I’ve b een asking myself, is whether employment data and indices derived largely from measures of job growth correctly provide the best sense of the overall climate of a regional economy—and in the case of Massachusetts, a state economy—that is driven increasingly by high value-added industries  whose employment patterns reflect cycles of innovation more than  traditional business cycles.  Contacts in  the high-tech, biot ech, and software worlds all indicate that business is solid and that money to expand is freely av ailable.  Depending on the product, growth is either occurring or in the works, but of ten the related hiri ng is planned for lower-cost states outside New England or other count ries.  These businesses want their headquarters to remain in New England.  They want to strengthen their links to the research being done in the major universities, and they  regard the highly sk illed labor that they need in their research activities as       39 of 100hard to find and increasingly expens ive.  But when they expand more  broadly, they are choosing to expand elsewhere. Thus, there are areas of strength an d weakness in some of the regi onal data.  The states of the region seem to be doing pretty well fiscally, and that reflects th e profitability of ma ny of these high-tech types of businesses. But bu sinesses that thrive on growing job counts, like commercial office what the states have projected in their budgets.  Somewhat surprisingly, consumer confidence has ticked up a bit desp ite the flat job picture, and residential real estate market s still seem strong, though the high end has lost a bit of st eam.  Travel and tourism has its  tos and fros.  The fall wasn’t particularly good for leaf peeping, but the winter  looks not bad because there has been some early snowfall for skiing. The region is going to bear the brunt of high en ergy costs this winter, given its dependence on heating oil and expensive natural gas for electricity generation.  That prob ably is the reason why overall business confidence has softened a bit.  In my exp ectation, the region may well continue to lag the nation in job gr owth, but should prove resilient th rough the winter months.  I think the mix of its industries is not only providing resilience to the re gion but also an ongoing impetus to the productivity growth we see for the nation as a whole. Incoming data since the last Co mmittee meeting were on the high  side of our expectations and provided welcome assurance that at  least for the time being the energy shock, hurricane destruction, and slight softening in housing markets did little to impede the underlying  forward momentum of the national economy.  And the recent robust data on productivity growth provide even more assurance that this pace of underlying momentum is occurring at a time when there may be  more rather than less capacity.  Indeed, if one assumes less of a downward trend in labor  force participation than the           40 of 100Greenbook projection, which is certainly in the realm of the possib le, available capacity could be even greater. Our forecast is perhaps not quite  as optimistic as the Greenbook’ s, but it does see the same two rather distinct economic phases over the forecast horizon .  In the near term, after a bit of a dip in the fourth quarter, which may not be  much of a dip at this point, growth accelerates as hurricane rebuilding proceeds, federal spending increases, ener gy price growth rates flat ten, and inventories are rebuilt. Then by mid-2006, the ec onomy slows, as tighter monetary po licy puts a crimp in real estate the near term, inflation pressures ar e expected to be more significant,  with some pass-through of high energy costs to core infl ation.  Over the medium term, these pressures ease. It’s certainly possible for surpri ses on either side of  this baseline.  That is, we could see inflation around longer than we no w expect or, on the oppo site side, we could see demand falter, with consumer retrenchment in the face of slower hiring.  I continue to believe that managing the risks of rising prices reduces the potential cost of mistakes , and that suggests some further tightening.  But how long that will be necessary, in my view anyway, is uncertain.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On ba lance, economic activity is growing at a solid pace in the Fi fth District, though auto sa les are faltering an d housing markets are cooling.  On the upside, employment cond itions have been streng thening, with signs th at the job numbers are increasing even at District fact ories.  Outside of autos and big- ticket items though , retail sales strengthened substantially this mo nth.  Retailers indicate  that holiday sales ar e solid, and they’ve become more optimistic about pros pects for the first half  of ’06.  Auto sale s are weak, though, and SUVs remain unpopular even after the season’s fi rst snowfall.  Services fi rms are also upbeat, with            41 of 100revenues and employment growing over  the last two months.  Home sa les remain at hi gh levels but we are receiving widespread report s that activity is decelerating, pa rticularly in northern Virginia where markets have been qu ite robust in recent years.   A number of independe nt reports describe “a return to normalcy” in residential real estate mark ets, with houses actually  being on th e market and not getting multiple bids on the first day.  Ma nufacturing continues to hold its own.  Although shipments and new orders were softer in early Dece mber, the hiring index was up for our Di strict, and firms have become notably more optimi stic about their early ’06 prospects. District price pressures seem to  have eased somewhat in Dece mber.  Although retail prices were reported to have advanced at the same st rong pace as in November, outside the retail sector services’ prices have decelerated from October to  December.  Manufacturing price gains peaked in slowed sharply this month. Turning to the national economy, we’ve received a string of favo rable data since our October meeting, suggesting both that the economy had consid erable momentum prior to  this fall’s storms and that the effects of the storms on economic activity outside the affected region and the energy sector have not been as large as feared.  I’m particular ly encouraged by the continued strength in business investment spending in the present quarter, as  evidenced by capital goods orders and the ISM numbers. I’m also encouraged by  anecdotal reports of a cooling in District and national housing investment.  That said, I’m tempted to paraphras e Solow, though, and say that the slowdown in housing appears to be visible everywhere but in the housing activity data.  [Laughter] Consumer spending has held up qu ite well.  My sense is that the most important source of this stability and strength is  households’ beliefs ab out their real income  growth in the near  future.  For this         42 of 100reason, given the Greenbook foreca st for income growth in the n ear term, I would not expect a flattening of housing prices to se riously dampen consumer spending.  Rather, I expect, consistent with the Greenbook, consumer sp ending growth to come in on the strong side going forward, with the saving rate rising only slowly. The inflation picture has also improved notabl y since our last  meeting, in my mind.  The survey measures and TIPS  compensation spreads have come down off the po st-Katrina highs they reached earlier this fall. While the inflation picture is so mewhat better, it does leave some room for concern, in my view.  This Greenbook foreca sts a 2.2 percent core infl ation rate for the first ha lf of ’06, less than the last Greenbook, but it stil l makes me somewhat uncomfortable. With oil prices appearing to have found a stable range in the neighborhood of $60 a barrel and with natural gas prices remaining high and volatile, I think it will be several months before the risk of pass-through can be completely put to bed. As for the econometr ic evidence about pass-t hrough, I’d note that expectations regarding our policy response represent a latent va riable that of necessity is omitted in most econometric exercises.  I take less comfort from the econometric evidence than you do , President Yellen.  Our preemption In the meantime, I think we need to ensure that the public understands our resolve with regard to inflation.  And the r eal funds rate in the neighborhood of 2 percent is very lik ely too low for an economy that’s in a sustained expa nsion with relatively full resource utilizati on.  So I think it’s appropriate to follow through today with a 25  basis point increase in the funds rate.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero.         43 of 100MR. SANTOMERO. Than k you, Mr. Chairman.  There ha s been little cha nge in Third District economic conditions since ou r last meeting.  The regional ec onomy continues to  expand at its potential pace, which is somewhat lo wer than in other parts of the country.  Payroll employment is increasing steadily in our three states, and the tri-state unemploym ent rate fell to 4.3 percent in Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace.  The index of general activity in our manufacturing survey eased slig htly to 11.5 in November from 17.3 in October.  Although there has be en some month-to-month vo latility in the index this ye ar, it has generally been near the average that was reco rded in the 1990s expansion. Retailers report a slight ly better sales figure for October an d November compared to the same period a year ago.  In general, sales of luxury goods and consumer electronic s continue to expand more strongly than other lines of merchandise, and discount stores had better results than mid-priced department and specialty stores.  While construction con tinues to be a strong sector in our region, we are beginning to see early signs of moderation in the housing market.  These signs do not point to a sharp drop, only a slight softening of demand.  As elsewhere, permits have declined and real estate agents reported slower sales in October and November.  So me agents also noted that the number of existing homes on the There was also a slight easing in price appreciation in each  of the three states in  the third quarter, and this moderation appears to be co ntinuing in the fourth quarter. We continue to see signs of higher prices fo r industrial goods in ou r region.  There was a sharp increase in the price indices in  our manufacturing survey in Octobe r.  This eased only slightly in             44 of 100elevated.  The future pric e indices are high relative to most readings during  the expansion, and the results of a special survey  question indicate that cost increases are widely anticipated for all inputs next year.  These expectations are widespread across firms—and more widespread than during the summer period when we asked the same question .  Indeed, while our business contacts expect continued moderate expansion in business activity, rising prices beyo nd those in energy have become more of a concern for firms in our District. Turning to the national economy, I note that the Greenbook forecast has been revised to show more underlying strength in  the third and fourth quarte rs compared to la st time.  It’s more consistent with my own view on the national economy.  Incoming data over th e intermeeting period suggest that the economy retained a g ood deal of upward momentum.  The third-quarter preliminary GDP figures showed broad-based strength in consumption and fixe d investment growth, with  strong productivity gains. Despite the dislocation fr om Hurricane Katrina, we have stur dy underlying jo b growth and a low unemployment rate .  Consumer confidence has partially recovered from post-hurricane lows, and consumer spending outside autos continues to adva nce at a moderate pace.  Business spending has also strengthened since the summer, and manufac turing productivity an d business investment continue to advance.  In my mind, the risks to growth are slightly on the upside, as I read the data as supporting continued underlying strength. The official inflation numbers and readings on inflation expectations  have been somewhat reassuring over the intermeeting period.  To da te, we’ve seen little pass- through, as a number of people have noted, of higher energy prices into co re inflation, and we’ve al so seen some decline in energy prices.  In additi on, both near-term and long -term inflation expectations  have declined a bit. This news is clearly favorable to the inflation outlo ok.  However, it seems somewhat at odds with what we’re hearing from our business  contacts.  They indicate that th ey’re facing higher input prices              45 of 100and have recently found it somewhat easier to raise their own prices in the current environment of quite strong demand.  This view has also be en supported by our ow n and other manufacturing surveys. So I remain  concerned about inflationary  pressures, and I believe that an uptick in inflation is, indeed, a risk.   Therefore, a prudent course of action today, in my opinion, is to continue to gradually move rates up. Whether such  a move is closing in on the equilibrium real rate from belo w or whether such a move will put the real  funds rate above the equili brium value or place it in the rang e of uncertainty around the long-run value is an inte resting question.  So is how we will explain what we are going to do. But I’ll defer my views on thes e issues until the second part of our discussion.  Su ffice it to say I look forward to th at.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  What a difference si x weeks can make.  At our last meeting, the Greenbook offered two alternative scen arios—stagflation and a consumer sentiment slump—which at least from the Four th District’s perspective seemed  plausible and worrisome.  In early November, we ha d to consider the possibilit y that output growth might weaken even as inflation accelerated. Fortunately, the output and productivity data that we’ve received since that meeting have been on the upside, and the inflation news has be en generally encouraging.  Although th ere are still various scenarios to worry about today, stagflation an d a consumer sentiment slump no long appear to be among them.  My own information-gathering pr ocess during this intermeeting period leaves me very comfortable with the Greenb ook baseline, which now expects more favorable paths for output, productivity, and inflation than it called for at our last meeting. I have a few observations about each of these.  Fi rst, output.  The na tional pace of economic activity appears to be on the upswin g, even though in my  own District the economy appears to remain            46 of 100on a slower improvement trend.  Bankers report that the commercial loan pipelines ar e filling up, and competition among lenders is very strong.  As I said, my District has been  trailing the nation.  The automobile industry has a large weight in my Dist rict, and recent developments there, though not unexpected, are pretty dreary, as President Moskow repo rted.  The Big Three automobile companies and their suppliers are under intense pressure to downsize and reduce costs, especially labor costs. Many plant closings and layoffs have already been  announced, and th e dark clouds hanging over the industry are already havi ng adverse effects on many communities.  But most business leaders I speak with outside of the automobile industry are optimistic  about their national mark ets as they look into next year. Next I’ll comment on  productivity.  The CEOs that I talked to are s till working very  hard to generate profits by increa sing productivity.  I’m amazed by how frequently and uniformly CEOs talk about efficiency efforts under wa y in their companies.  A natura l consequence of the productivity culture, of course, is that business people are watchi ng their head counts very closely, even as their sales are expanding. Hospital ex ecutives are especially bullish about their ability to generate significant productivity gains, and they’ve been ra mping up their capital sp ending on equipment and facilities.  One of my di rectors works for a large commercial constr uction company an d reports that this is a nationwide trend. Finally, inflation.  Retailers te ll me that they’ve tr ained their customers to shop for bargains only too well.  Consumers are relen tless in their hunt for bargains, and Internet shopping is growing rapidly in popularity and making that  hunt for bargains easier.  Retaile rs in the Distri ct tell me that they expect consumers to hang back and wait until the bitter end for steeper discounts, and those discounts are going to inevitably rise  as Christmas looms close.  Conseq uently, retailers expect to turn over their inventories, but they anticipate having to  give up some of the nor mal profit margins that          47 of 100they seek at this time of the year .  Discounting is extremely intense.   Sales volume, then, should turn out well, but profits may be disappointing. Some manufacturers say that they  are finally getting a little tracti on with price increases above and beyond the energy surcharges.  But most manufacturers that I ta lked to report th at competition remains very intense and they emphasize that  they have little pricing pow er.  Although  businesses have had to absorb price increase s for many of their commodity inputs, several business executives note that raw materials prices have stopped increasing for the most part  and, in many instances, have started to decline. So as I look at the na tional economy, I’m ve ry comfortable with th e Greenbook baseline.  I expect productivity growth to hold up rather well next  year, along the lines of that faster productivity growth alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  Alt hough I indicated in my report at our last meeting that we could see stronger pass- through of energy prices, I was not hearing that from my business contacts in their reports this time ar ound.  In fact, many of them said that the energy and commodity price shocks that we’ve experienced in the past two years could move thro ugh our economy without elevating core inflation rates. The disappearance of the stagflation and co nsumer sentiment slump scenarios and the emergence of other risks serve as a reminder to me that the future, even the near-term future, is uncertain. The 70 percent confid ence range surrounding the Greenbook baseline projection is wide enough to include all of the alterna tive simulations.  I believe, as a couple of others have already said, that with another move today our policy accommodation will have been substantially removed, making the timing and extent of additional firming more uncertain fo r me.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Ok ay.  President Poole.             48 of 100MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ve been debatin g whether we should characterize the expansion as vigorous or solid.  I decided that it’s vigo rously solid.  [Laughter] On the consumption front, to give you an idea how strong demand is, my Wal-Mart contact says that 30 percent of the TVs th ey sell are now digital, up from 5 percent last holiday season.  They have greater sales also of other higher-end—mediu m and premium—price points .  And he says that inventory, if anything, is on the short side of de sired levels, particularly for the higher-end items. A pervasive theme in my discussions with busines s people is that construction costs are rising rather rapidly.  Wal-Mart says 10 to 15 percent, and that seems to be generally true across the economy, according to my c ontacts.  The transportation industry, I think, is stretched at this point. For quite some time there have been prob lems with rail transportation of coal.  Our contacts with a power company in the St. L ouis area said that they’ve been able to build stocks of coal at power plants but the level is  still well below the nor mal, desired level. A contact with a major trucking company said that they have no  plans to increase capacity in their truck business, which is about 30 percent of the to tal.  They plan a 5 percent increase in capacity in the intermodal area—that’s th e piggyback business—and 10 percent capacity ex pansion in the dedicated truck business, which involves truc ks for particular companies like Wal-Mart. My UPS contact said that they  have been stretched quite ti ghtly this holiday season; he mentioned that DHL has been having severe operati onal problems at its Wilm ington, Ohio hub.  UPS could not find extra lift, as they call it, on an ad hoc basis and ha d to have work-arounds to have enough capacity to meet th e demand.  UPS is planning  to expand its China-to-U.S. capacity next year by 26 percent, which reinforces wh at Richard said a few minutes ago. There is a risk of disruption because of strike s.  UPS—and FedEx is right behind—is coming to the end of the negotiati on with their pilots, which has not been going well.  The pilots in those         49 of 100companies are now the best paid in  the industry because the passenger airlines have reduced pilots’ pay. The pilots’ union is apparent ly adamant in wan ting a larger piece  of the profits of the company, so I think we shoul d not by any means rule out the possibility of a strike at  UPS early next year.  My contact there said that the level of frustration within the company about the various job actions by pilots is very high. Pilo ts have been calling in an d saying, for example, that  they’re fatigued and can’t fly, and they have caused a lot of disruption by tactics of that sort.  I think those are the only comments I want to  offer.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  Let me try to restart this  discussion by saying, first, that I largely agree with the Greenb ook assessment of the economy and,  in particular, with the overall positive economic outl ook it presents.  This is consistent w ith the incoming data  on the national economy that we’ve received recently  and with the preponde rance of recent repor ts on the District economy as well.  Notably, the Dist rict is benefiting fr om an overall good ye ar in agriculture, sustained improvement in the manufac turing sector, and what I would call positive subs titution effects stemming from hurricane-related disruptions elsewh ere, which have led, for example, to more shipping out of the Port of Dulu th-Superior than otherwise would have occurred, more volume for local trucking firms, and so forth. One minor difference I might have  with the Greenbook outlook pe rtains to the labor market and the unemployment rate. It seems to me that the forecast for economic grow th in 2006 overall is not terribly different from what we’ve had in ’04 and ’05.  And cumulative ly, the unemployment rate        50 of 100dropped nearly a full percentage poi nt from the end of 2003  to the end of 2005.  Using that as a rough guide or rule of thumb, I would th ink we’d get at least some modest  further decline in the rate of unemployment next year.  I would ha sten to add—and I think this is potentially a more important and wouldn’t affect my inflation forecas t.  In fact, looking at the totality  of the information available, I don’t think that the risks to the core inflation outlook are skewed  one way or the other, and I’m inclined to agree with Da ve Stockton’s assessment that inflationary  pressures are close to topping out.  I say this because incoming data on core inflation have been re latively favorable, bond markets suggest to me that inflation exp ectations remain well anchored, and a lot of polic y accommodation has been removed.   Indeed, summing up these factors as  well as the results from most versions of the Taylor rule presented in the Bluebook, calculations with Fishe r-type interest rate equa tions, and the Greenbook forecast itself, it seems to  me that after this meetin g we will at least be very close to the point where we will have rais ed the federal funds rate suff iciently for no w.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Our forecast fo r the national outlook has not changed substantially since the last meeting, and relative to th e discussions so far, I gu ess we’re slightly at the stronger end. The recent data have been encouraging both here  and internationally.  The underlying pace of demand growth seems pre tty good to us—goo d enough to rais e the probability of the expansion continuing at a pace at or sligh tly above trend.  The in flation news has also been reassuring, though underlying inflation is still running somewhat above what we’d like to see over time.          51 of 100We believe these conditions justify some furt her tightening of mone tary policy, perhaps another 50 to 75 basis points. We  are, therefore, comfortable with the expectations now built into the objectives are roughly balanced.  So, relative to Septem ber and October, we see somewhat less downside risk to growth, perhaps ev en some upside risk, an d somewhat less upside risk to inflation.  As this implies, our view is  very close to  the Greenbook. Let me mention a few other poin ts.  The apparent strength in  productivity should make us more comfortable about th e sustainability of the expansion and a bit less c oncerned about the near- term inflation risks because, of course, if the pr oductivity growth stays stronger longer, we can be more confident that consumer sp ending will stay reasonably strong  even if a more substantial slowdown in housing materi alizes.  Scenarios in which more-moderate house price appreciation or some decline in housing prices le ads to a sizable increase in the pe rsonal saving rate are probably less plausible or less troubling in an environment where consumers are more confident in the outlook for the economy or more confident in  their future income growth. The productivity news, combined with contin ued moderation in the co re inflation numbers and the moderation in measures of inflation expectations, make the inflation ou tlook somewhat more favorable.  But against these factors there are others that ju stify some continued attention.  Of course, overall inflation is still hi gh, even though we expect it to moderate.  Vari ous measures of underlying inflation are still abov e what we would be comfor table with over time.  Ther e probably is still some energy cost pressure in the pipeline.  And the TIPS-derived measures of in flation expectations over the medium term, if you adjust fo r the carry effect, have not really  moved down that  much.  With compensation growth accelerating, we  would expect eventually to see some upward pressure on labor costs, though of course less than  would be the case with lower pr oductivity numbers.  Moreover,            52 of 100surveys and anecdotal reports of pricing behavior, as we read them, suggest that  businesses are able to pass on some share of their increa sed costs.  So for thes e reasons, even with th e additional tightening priced into the markets, we probab ly face some modest upside risk to our inflation forecast and to our objective, and we should continue to lean against this risk in what we do and what we say. We don’t see evidence yet to su pport a concern that the path of the nominal fed funds rate now priced into the markets risks go ing too far.  Housing may be slow ing a bit, but no t really much.  Other spending indicators look st rong—probably stronger than we thought—and the strength is broader than it has been across th e components of GDP.  Expected real rates don’t suggest a high degree of concern, in our view.  It ’s just some concern, but not acut e concern about the downside risk to future growth.  If you try to take out expected in flation from forward rates, it looks as if real rates move up over the 2- to 5-year horizon.  Equity prices, credit spreads, an d the implied volatility of most asset prices don’t seem to suggest a lot of concern about signi ficant deterioration ahead in the pace of the expansion. Although we don’t think the narrowing of the term  spread itself or the lo w overall level of the yield curve offers clear guidance about monetary policy—clear guida nce in terms of arguing for a softer or firmer stance than th e other fundamentals migh t suggest—we’re somewhat more inclined to take the view that this change in the structure of term premia suggests we w ill have to do more than otherwise would have been the case.  So all of this suggests to us that we should continue to tighten further and signal that we thin k we have still more to do. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The news over  the intermeeting period has suggested some shift in the nature of the inflatio n risks faced by the econom y.  Low and stable core consumer price inflation together with declining retail en ergy prices and some continued edging lower          53 of 100of inflation expectations seem to imply a reduced th reat from near-term feed-t hrough of energy prices to expectations or to core inflation. At the same time, however, information on output and demand indicate that the economy remains on a growth track which is expandi ng a little more quick ly than potential su pply.  And this is a trajectory that would increase pr essure on resources at a time when those resour ces are already being fairly well employed. Th e reasons for the great er-than-expected momentum in output are unclear.  Some of the strength ma y represent a more muted response to hurricane disruptions or energy prices than anticipated, but much would seem to be  related to underlying strength in aggregate demand.  The upward surprises in de mand in the third quarter were global, not just in the United States. Increases in industrial commodity prices a nd sizable gains in equity prices around the world evidence widespread econom ic strength and expectations  that it wi ll persist. Added demand an d rising equity prices ha ve provoked little, if any,  offsetting tightening in financial conditions in credit mark ets.  Long-term interest rates globally were little changed on balance over the intermee ting period, and risk  spreads out the yield curve and across risk categories continue to be low, refl ecting the basically optimistic outlook of investors. Perhaps the resilience of the global economy to oil price increases and persistent ex pansion in global GDP, including in such la ggards as Japan, are slowly in creasing the confidence of non-financial businesses as well.  In the United States, the gr owth of business investment has come into line with past relationships with  the cost of capital and change s in output, though the level of investment still remains a bit lo wer than might be expected. As a consequence of this strength, one question is whether the current co nstellation of interest rates and asset prices, including expectations of th e funds rate topping out in the 4½ to 4¾ percent range here, is tight enough to pr oduce the moderation in growth need ed to keep the economy in the         54 of 100neighborhood of its potential and to keep inflation stable.  In the staff fore cast and in the markets, such a rise in the funds rate is seen as sufficie nt to contain inflation, and that strikes me as a reasonable estimate, pendin g further information.   Although long-term rates haven’t changed much for several quarters, sh ort- and in termediate- term rates have increased quite a lot and will cont inue to move higher as we firm policy.  These higher rates should exert increasi ng restraint on spending, especia lly for households that have been relying on borrowing at low short- term rates to short-circuit liquidi ty and income constraints when buying durables or houses. The slowing in cons umer credit growth and mo rtgage loan applications  in recent months may, indeed, indicate that higher short- and intermed iate-term rates are beginning to bite.  Moreover, perhaps as a consequence of the rise  in borrowing costs, we do see so me signs of a co oling in housing and buyers have deteriorat ed noticeably in re cent months, and the shift in attitudes may be particularly important when a significant portion of the activity in this market has been linked to investment demand.  Based on these indicators and others , a slowing of house pr ice appreciation and a moderation in construction activity next year seem to be a reasonable expectation.  Such a slowing is a critical element behind th e moderation in growth next year in th e staff forecast, an d I suspect in the Still, we need to see mo re concrete evidence that  this channel is  working as an ticipated, both in prices and in activity, before we can be confiden t that demand is likely to moderate.  Nonetheless, the incoming information also reinforces the notion th at we can afford to retain the gradual path of policy tightening as we look for signs that modera tion is coming.  With the upward revision to estimated structural productivity growth, the economy is not expanding very much above its long-run       55 of 100growth of potential.  In  addition, the better productivity and th e downward revision  to compensation data show the increase in business costs being held in check better than had been evident.  And the higher rate of growth of structural productivity should help to hold down that increase  in costs going forward.  Moreover, the markups of pr ice over unit labor costs have ri sen appreciably in the last two quarters for both nonfarm business as  a whole and, within that category, for nonfinancial corporations.  And those markups are close to the record highs of the mi d-1990s, suggesting that businesses have some room and incentive to abso rb some of the increases in labor costs that might be coming. As a consequence of these deve lopments, I think we can be a little less conc erned about the immediate threat of higher  inflation, though we still  need to focus on forest alling the potential for supply-demand imbalances to develop over th e medium run.  Than k you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  The concept of the known unknown came to the national consciousness about a year or two ago, and I sense that it’s very much in th is room today.  The baseline forecast calls for a very nice, soft landing to potent ial growth with cont ained inflation if we just tighten our policy on e or two more turns.  I’m certainly pr epared to accept that forecast for the purpose of today’s meeting, but the uncertainties or the known-unknown factors around it are to me quite obvious.  To me the risks ar e clearly to the upside with respect  to growth, but surprisingly may be more balanced with respect to inflation. It is easier to see an upside growth risk than  a downside one, in large part because the incoming data have been  surprisingly robust, making a slowing just a quarter or two away seem a little bit of a stretch.  Mu ch of the waning wealth ef fect on which the baseline  is built is due to a slowing in the housing market.  It is true that some of the in dicators suggest some  moderation there, including a slight edging off of mortgage applications and a sourin g of home-buying attitudes.  But             56 of 100when lined up against the actual strength shown in home sales th emselves, both existing and new— and also prices, which have contin ued to appreciate at a double-digi t pace through the third quarter— it is hard to say that the housin g market is anything but robust. A second element of the wealth effect that th e Greenbook assumes is that the equity price appreciation will be no more than needed to keep the cu rrent level of the equity risk premium about stable.  But again, it is easy to see some upside potential here.  The equity risk premium is now above average.  The recent run-up in eq uity prices, coupled with sustai ned high levels of productivity growth, an attractive profits outloo k, and healthy co rporate balance sheets all make it perhaps a little more likely that equity prices will  rise rather than fall, and indeed, rise more th an expected.  If this were to occur, the earnings-price ratio would declin e and the equity risk prem ium would return to the normal range, and in doing so wo uld provide more equity wealth  impetus to the economy than perhaps the baseline assumes. Finally, global growth is a surpri se to the upside.  As Dino i ndicated, equity prices have shown remarkable strength globa lly.  Monetary policy itself has in many cases been somewhat stimulative and generally financial conditions have been  supportive of growth.  All of this suggests a bias toward faster global growth due to  accommodative financial markets broadly. On inflation, I judge that the risks to the baselin e forecast are perhaps a little better balanced.  While the upside growth risk would certainly pressure  resources with inflationary consequences, that is not the entire story.  For one thing, inflation has come in a little softer rece ntly than we had expected. Secondly, energy  prices seem to have flattened, and market participants expect them to moderate even further, providing a rapid diminution of the upward mo mentum to headline inflation.  Thirdly, import prices se em likely to remain contained; and for both energy prices and import prices,        57 of 100pass-through has been relatively lo w.  Finally and importantly, long er-term inflation expectations are moderate. I would also add in this regard something th at has not been much discussed here: Labor compensation itself ha s been on the weaker si de, even as reso urce utilization has tightened.  And finally, the productivity growth st ory, I think, ha s shown continued robustness.  In this regard I’d point out that we talk a great deal  about the upward adjustment to the structural productivity growth in the staff forecast, but all they’ve real ly done is just to maintain what has happened  from 2001 to 2004.  So maybe we’ve put too much we ight on the temporary downward movement as opposed to just recognizing that things haven’t changed very much. So given this view of the ri sks around the forecast, why do  I propose that we accept the baseline for purposes of today’s decision and commun ication?  First, I am mindful that policy works with long and variable lags.  While the risks for us  are not totally balanced, the greater weight of the evidence, I think, is still  for a good outc ome, given that we have moved rates up quite considerably.  And with inflation expectations still well contained,  I think there’s no re ason to adjust market perceptions of what we’re likely to  do going forward.  If those two facts did not adhere, my judgment might be different. Secondly, one would have to say that while the hou sing sector story is yet to come, there are, as we’ve heard around this table, a large number of anecdotes a ll pushing primarily  in the same direction—supporting, I would think, the baseline. Third, I take some comf ort in the fact that the baseline forecast is shared roughly by most outside forecasters.  The Greenbook does not seem to be out of the tr end.  The Blue Chip consensus is that after more than two y ears of above-trend growth, act ivity in 2006 is likely to moderate to its trend rate and perhaps a bit below by the end of the ye ar.  Importantly, the fe d funds assumptions that            58 of 100underlie the Blue Chip ar e not distinguishable dram atically from the Green book forecast.  President Moskow has already talked about wh at happened in Chicag o at their outlook symp osium.  Again, the consensus seems quite consistent with our forecast from  the staff.  And the NABE members we met with in this room not to o long ago also expect gr owth to be in the range of 3.25 to 3.5 in 2006. Finally, I am willing to take the baseline as the basi s for policy today beca use I recognize that our language will convey the proper sense of cau tion to reflect the risks and leave us with the flexibility to respond to other changes.  I will delay any further comment on that , as you have suggested, until th e second part of our discussion.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON. Thank y ou, Mr. Chairman.  At each of our la st eleven or twelve meetings there has been a presumption in the analysis for several more m oves of tightening.  An d while I agree that a ¼ point increase in the funds rate is appropriate for today, I no longer find in our analysis a presumption of multiple move s to raise it further. From Q4 to Q4, the rise in core  PCE prices is estimated to be 1.8 percent in ’05, up to 2.1 percent in ’06, and back to 1.8 perc ent in ’07.  Now, th e alternative scenarios for core PCE include a single option heavily driven by a pres umed greater impact of rising ener gy prices on co re inflation.  And as I indicated to  President Yellen, I’m interested in going  back and rereading that analysis.  The Greenbook forecast is for the fed funds target to rise to 4½ perc ent and be maintained at that level.  I just looked at the chart in  exhibit 1 that was handed out at the break and compared it to the chart that was in the Bluebook, and the market seems to be even more sure that we will overshoot and then retreat with respect to  the fed funds rate. I share President Stern’s analysis  with respect to the equilibrium real  rate and the extent to which our fed funds level relates to the range of va lues under the commonly used Taylor rules.  I            59 of 100think there’s a legiti mate concern about the eff ect a premature pause would have on inflationary expectations, and I take that very seriously.  But, again,  I do not see yet in ou r analysis where that needs to drive our concern.  Therefore, unlike in previous meetings, where th ere was a presumption of multiple increases, I think that perh aps after today we woul d need to look for a justification for such increases. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to echo Dave Stockton’s analogy of tidings of great joy in this forecast.  I think the upward  revision in growth and the downward revision in inflation are developments that we all welcom e at this point in th e economic expansion. As I tried to assess some of the information to see where I woul d want to come out on policy, I tended to take an approach sim ilar to the one President Yellen took, in saying: Where do we stand at this point in our effort to remove accommodation, and where are we going as we move forward?  In the alternative scenarios la id out in this Greenbook, there is really only one where long-term inflation expectations lose their anchor and which therefore gi ves me much con cern.  As I looked at where we are on inflation, I was struck that there is some good news  and some bad news and that there are currently risks on both sides.  La st year we saw inflation coming up  from extraordin arily low levels— moving up from 1 percent to ov er 2 percent.  It rebounded qui ckly, and I was one who was quite concerned by how quickly inflation had moved up.  In the last six months, though, it has been 1.6 percent, which sounds like a fairly  good area for it to be  in.  But the fact that  it rebounded so fast clearly indicates that we always have to be very alert to developments on that front, because prices can move rapidly. The energy pass-through, I think, is  a risk for higher inflation.  I’d love to see the analysis that San Francisco has done on that issue because, depending on  what level of costs are passed through, I                  60 of 100think we could see real concerns about disruptions and risk s to the economy going forward—as a consequence, for example, of believing that energy pr ices are going to stay in a high range for several years or seeing the possibility  of outright shor tages in areas lik e natural gas.  We’ve also seen that other central banks in the world are now expecting stronger growth and higher inflation in their economi es.  The ECB [European Central Bank], as was mentioned earlier, finally raised its policy rate, and ev en the Bank of Japan is coming out of a zero rate world.  So some of the cushion we’ve had worldwide may be modera ting, and that could pro duce more risks on the upside on inflation. On the other hand, when I look at what has been happening with jobs growth and labor compensation, I continue to be st ruck by how moderate the growth in compensation has been.  The productivity story is clearly one reason for this.  The numbers continue to am aze me at this point in the cycle.   It’s easy to achi eve productivity gains in a company early on when you have excess capacity. But this many years into an expansion, it really takes a ton of attention and effort. Another thing that often comes up in my conversations with business executives is this:  They are sitting at very hi gh levels of profit and cash  flow generation; and when  you ask them  about their main challenges, they still say thei r primary challenge is to  maintain profit growth.  If you start to dig into that, you find that it’ s beyond just managing wa ge costs and looking at ca pital.  The lessons they learned in the ’90s in terms of re ally changing the way business processes are run are continuing to play a role in all of the decisi ons they’re making on issues like inventory management—not tying up capital either in inventory stored  or in warehouse capacity.  As I looked at last month’s numbers, inventor y-sales ratios hit record lows.  So clearly, businesses are continuing to learn more and more about how to keep inventory levels very, very low—even though they’re trying to customize the delivery of products.  And they are doing that          61 of 100through better informatio n systems and better order management systems. They also  are focusing a great deal on quality control, particularly in services and re tail businesses, and in business services where that is a key differen tiator with the competition.   But better quality also has major cost benefits because it reduces errors and the need to redo work  and it focuses on  the timeliness of  delivery.  And these are the kinds of valu es beyond prices that cu stomers are rating as incr easingly important.  So firms get both greater efficiency and value added for their customer  base more than  in the past. And finally, outsourcing—and I’m talking not internatio nally but simply ou tside of the core enterprise—is a business practice that  evolved in the ’90s and has proven  to be very important.  In the old days when you ran a big corporation that was vertically integrated, th ere were cost centers throughout the organization and it was very hard fo r CFOs to get a handle on controlling costs.  Now that the culture has become “if it isn’t a core function , you ought to try to outs ource it,” the process of renegotiating with the contractors annually or semi-a nnually or every three years and of going out for other bids puts continual pressure on attainin g productivity improvements and a favorable cost payback. But when the function was embedded in th e bigger orga nization, the social politics sometimes got in the way an d made it difficult to  wring out the cost s.  The fact is that firms now try not to do everything, and to outso urce functions unrelated to their core business.  That this has become an ingrained practice in many companies is another theme I’ m hearing.  So, in short, I’m finding that changes in business pr actices are the focus of a lot of companies.  And they believe that despite higher costs, they are going to be able to  improve the value with m odest price in creases going forward. Pulling all of that together, I tend to think that we are very close to the end of the increases in interest rates that we need  to implement.  There are risks on both sides, but it strikes me, based on the Greenbook forecast, that we’re getti ng to full potential in a very orderly way.  And as was mentioned                                                             62 of 100a minute ago, according to  the Bluebook, the real fed funds rate  that we would have with a 25 basis point increase today is at the midpoi nt of the range of the staff’s esti mates of equilibrium.  Also, it’s above the funds rate derived from th e policy rules for all of  the alternatives.  So we are close to where I think we need to be, given the forecast.

MR. MADIGAN.2  Mr. Chairman, earlier you referre d to the comedic talents of my two colleagues to the right. For my part, in drafting the Bluebook over the past week, I fear that I may have been engaged in trage dy.  [Laughter]  That is , there certainly was drama depicting a protagonist—yours truly—en gaging in a significant struggle ending in ruin or utter disappointment.  For the remainder of my remarks, I’ll be referring to the material that was handed out at the break. Over the intermeeting period, indications of considerable momentum in economic activity led market participants to build in a little more near-ter m monetary tightening, as shown in the upper left-hand panel of exhib it 1.  Market participants now appear to believe that the funds rate will peak at a bout 4¾ percent in mid-2006 but be rolled back slightly thereafter.  The consensus Blue  Chip forecast released on December 1, not shown, also indicates a median anticipation that about three more quarter-point moves are in store, but those forecasters don’t  have the Committee easing until early 2007.   For the near term, as shown in the upper ri ght-hand panel, fed funds futures indicate that investors are all but certain that you w ill firm another 25 basis points today.  They see about an 80 percent chance of another such step in Ja nuary and put better-than-even odds on one more move in March. And seemingly everyone recognizes that your statement is in play today.  The financial press and market lette rs in recent days have devoted most of their monetary policy analysis not to your rate adjustment but to your choice of words.  As shown in the middle left-hand panel, the Desk’s surv ey indicated that most primary dealers expect that today you will modify or drop th e references to “accommodative” monetary policy and that half look for the “measured pace” language to be changed or deleted.  But there is little indication th at market participants anticipate a structural change to your risk assessment. A case for firming policy today is outlined in the middle right-hand panel.  According to staff estimates, the economy appears to have little remaining slack, with 2 The materials used by Mr. Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).         63 of 100the unemployment rate in the vicinity of th e NAIRU and real GDP just a fraction of a percent below the level of its potential. Moreover, the economy appears to have considerable momentum that , without further firming, could carry aggregate demand beyond the level of potential output. Such mome ntum might be seen as consistent with a real federal funds rate that is still relatively low.  As shown in the lower panel, the real funds rate is within, but  near the lower end of, the ra nge of staff estimates of its equilibrium.  With some of the indirect e ffects of higher crude and natural gas prices still in prospect and likely providing some impetus to the inflationary process, you might be particularly concerned about th e implications of resource pressures for inflation. On the whole, though, incoming data over the intermeeting period have seemed broadly consistent with your earlier expectations that the economy and inflation would evolve in such a way as to warrant  further measured firming.  And financial quarter-point move today is a sure thing. A more difficult question—one that could bear  particularly on your statement this afternoon—is how much more tightening is likely to prove necessary.  Even recognizing the substantial firming of policy to da te as well as the lags in the effects of policy—an issue flagged by a number of you this morning—you may still believe that considerable further policy tightening lies ah ead.  If so, you might be attracted to the language of the Bluebook’s alte rnative C, shown in the right -hand column of exhibit 2.  In the rationale section, row 2, this announ cement would point to vigorous growth in the real economy and would retain the references to policy accommodation and robust underlying productivity growth.  The recent strength in aggregate demand might suggest a relatively high level for the equilibr ium funds rate and thus imply that policy remains accommodative.  And, certainly, the remarkable fi gures for the third quarter could support a judgment that  underlying productivity growth remains robust.  In row 3, alternative C would point to “relatively high levels of reso urce utilization” as another reason for policy firming.  In rows 4 and 5, th is alternative would re tain both the form and substance of the Committee’s assessment of risks from recent policy statements, including the judgment that policy accomm odation could probably continue to be removed at a measured pace.  Markets would be quite surprised by such an announcement, and rates would likely back up considerably. If, however, you believe that the end of this  tightening cycle is not far off—or if you simply believe that the time has come to jettison the reference to accommodative policy and some other stale language—then you may prefer the word ing of alternative B. This statement would differ significantly from recent announcements.  As shown in row 2, the Committee would indicate that th e expansion appears solid despite the effects of the hurricanes and high energy pr ices, while deleting the references to accommodative policy and underlying productivi ty growth.  In row 3, the statement would again acknowledge that co re inflation has been low of  late and that longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. It would express concern, however, that “possible increases in resource utilization as well as elev ated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures.”        64 of 100The assessment of risks would be modified notably.  Rather than making the arguably tautological asserti on that the risks appear ba lanced assuming “appropriate monetary policy,” it would indicate that th e “Committee judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed  to keep the risks to  the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.”  I emphasize “measured” because views on the Committee regarding the inclusion of this word clearly vary. As a staff memorandum indicat ed last week, the Ch airman requests that in your comments in the upcoming round you expr ess your preferences on this score.  In your consideration of this matter, you might see “measured” as representing a needless restraint on your possi ble actions.  But, as shown in row 5, the Committee would in effect also indicate that—as has al ways been the case—the risk assessment is not a commitment but a conditional expectati on and that, should incoming data diverge from expectations, the Committee would comm ensurately recalibrate its actual and anticipated actions. Moreover, you might see little prospect that policy will actually need to move in 50 basis point steps but be  concerned that, if the Committee were to drop the word now, especially in the contex t of the other proposed changes to the statement, market participants could concl ude that you saw the potential need for such large moves.   One factor that could influence th e Committee’s decision about the new assessment-of-risks language is whether you anticipate any problem adjusting that language as circumstances evol ve in coming months.  This appears unlikely to be a major problem.  If, contrary to current expe ctations, more aggressive policy tightening comes to appear appropriate, the Committee could change the reference in row 4 to something like “considerable further tightening.”  Or, s hould the end point seem to move out in time a little, the Committee could simply repeat the proposed assessment.  And, finally, if and when it appears that  policy has reached a resting point, the Committee could firm a final 25 basis points and change row 4 to something like the following: “Under these circumstances, the Committee judges that th e current stance of policy roughly balances the risks to the atta inment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability.” And at that point the “measured” terminology could be honorably discharged from service. Given the large number of changes in the announcement proposed for alternative B, it is difficult to be confident in anticipati ng the market reaction th at it would engender.  Indeed, investors also seem to be rather uncertain about the market effect of this afternoon’s announcement, but markets ar e striving for completeness by offering insurance on the direct effect of your imminent policy action.  Specifically, an option is being traded on the change in the 10-year  Treasury yield in a two-hour window around your announcement today.  The pricing of that option suggests a one-third probability that the 10-year yield will move one way or another by more than 4.3 basis points.  [Laughter] For our part, the staff’s gue ss is that the announcement proposed for alternative B would lik ely boost interest rates, but not by much. Finally, let me say a word about procedure.   As you will recall, the survey of the FOMC that the staff conducted last mont h regarding statement language included,                  65 of 100among other things, questions on the scope of the Committee’s policy vote—that is, whether the Committee should vote on just th e directive and the ri sk assessment, or whether the vote should be expanded to cover all forward-looking elements or the entire statement.  In preparation for a possible change, Chairman Greenspan has asked the staff to provide to the Committee early next year a memorandum that will discuss the pros and cons of alternative approaches to this issue.    Thank you. That concludes my prepared remarks.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It’s inte resting to listen to the di scussion around this table today because the underlying facts are really somewhat different from  what we had perceived at our last meeting. There is evidence th at the economy is moving  at a pace and in a direction that I don’t think we would have anticipated six weeks or two months ago, es pecially in the context of the hurricanes.  The underlying real rate of growth is rea lly powerful.   We can see it in the United Stat es but just as importantly, if not  more so, we are beginning to see it abroad.  Japan is finally getting its act together, as best I can judge.  For a lo ng period of time Japan had very poor financial results within its banking system; and while they had a nonperforming loan statistic, it certainly wasn’t anything like the type that we would calculate.  Th erefore it looked as though the economy wa s a fragile one, with a banki ng system that was largely reliant on real estate collateral whose prices con tinuously plummeted.  Mo reover, the state of fina ncial intermediation in Japan was highly dubious because ba nking is the only vehicle they have for interm ediation; there really isn’t an alternate means of  moving savings into investment.  However, the Japanese banking system has finally gotten to a po int where it look s like a regular, old-fashioned banking system.  Intermediation is now going  on.  A lot of the piece s are beginning to come t ogether.  And the reason this is important is that for a very long time we’ve been disregarding Japan as  an international force,          66 of 100even though it’s the second largest econom y in the world.  That’s because it just never moved.  As a consequence, the Japanese economy wasn’t an impor tant factor in the globa l outlook but it now seems to be moving in a favorable direction.  And we’re even getting s tirrings in Europe, where Germany, though still in  very serious trouble, is clearly showing some signs of improv ement.  Obviously, thei r unit labor costs have stabilized, and the impact of thei r very serious structural problems seems not to be getting worse. When one looks around the world, most economies are improvin g.  In the Unit ed States, some of the old-fashioned data, as I wa s mentioning to David yesterday,  are showing some very strong signs. One example is th at moribund industry whic h used to be the cutting edge fifty years ago, the steel industry.  Durable g oods, no matter how you cut it, are still largely made of steel, and those into the future. There is buoyancy there and al so in the nonferrous metals markets—markets we never used to worry about, but they still do matter.  The reason it is tough to get similar information out of, say, the high-tech industries is that while they are growing very rapidly, the dispersion  from one company to the other is dramatic.  In other words, if you get an  industry growth rate of  15 percent, say, you migh t find that one company grows 30 percent for two years and then its growth goes down to 2 percent and vice versa for some other firm.  So, with the technolog y changing so rapidly, you can’t get the anecdotal readings from a lot of those companie s the way you do on the old-fashioned industries wh ere nothing changes all that much and you have a reasonably go od base for making judgments. It’s hard to imagine an American economy that  is as balanced as th is one is.  But most importantly, through all of  this, we are literally s eeing some resistan ce to the upsid e pressures on inflation.  I find the most credib le evidence on this in the forwar d tranches of the 10-year Treasury          67 of 100note.  Every time pressures begin to move up the imp licit rate on the 1- year maturity being issued nine years out, when the rate gets  to somewhat over 5 percent it runs into resistance.   What I think is happening relates to the discussi on that I put on the table last meeting about the significant move of educat ed workforces into market economies from centrally planned economies—specifically the old Sovi et Union, and now far more impo rtantly China, an d to a limited extent India, which still has characteristics of central planning  as well.  At the meeting six weeks ago, we had no data at all about the ra te of change at which that transition is  occurring but it’s clearly a level adjustment.  And the rate at which it is happe ning is a determin ant of changes in  unit labor costs and, therefore, price changes or inflation. Some additional work has been do ne by Karen’s group, especially on China, in trying to get a judgment about the movement of wo rkers from the centrally planned sector of the economy to the competitive free market sector.  That work indicates in rough proxies—g ranted, these are extremely crude data—that the rate of change has been rising for a number of years and that there does not yet seem to be any evidence that it has peaked.  Now, ordinarily that would not be a great insight because the data are so poor. But if you’re looking for explanations of why we’re running into upside resistance on prices—every time we  get strong demand and increased short-term rates, long-term rates don’t want to move—this glob alization of the workforce seems to be a factor.   If you look at the charts on lo nger-term rates today, they go up,  they run into trouble, they come down. There’s a ce iling out there apparently, which suggests th at at least for the time being inflation expectations are clearly contained.  But judging from the real-time price da ta, they’re also soft.  And they are soft  around the world, not ju st in the United States.  We’re now getting price pressures in some places.  In a couple of countries th at are unbelievably expansionary and have irresponsible policies, we’re seeing inflation rates getting up to 6 or 7 percent.  The reason I raised the          68 of 100issue before is that twenty years ago those rates would have been 20  percent.  We’re not getting any of that.  So this is not a U.S. issue.  It ha s to be a global one. This suggests to me that we ha ve a very unusual situation where conventional analysis tells us very concretely the following: We’re running out of spare capac ity; things are tightening up; and wage rates are under pressure, though  not so much in the sk illed area in the Unit ed States as in the lesser skilled area where we’r e beginning to see wage ra tes rise.  Indeed, that is  evident in the series we run using the wage and salary data in the NIPA [nationa l income and product accounts] accounts—which of course are tied to virtually full coverage for the unemploym ent insurance system—and the employment and implicit hours data that come out of the es tablishment labor market survey. That survey reports data on average h ourly earnings for producti on or non-supervisory workers.  Using those data and th e totals from th e NIPAs, one can infer the average hourly wage for supervisory workers or skilled work ers—that is, the 20 percent of the workforce not included in the average hourly earnings data.  In the last several months, after having run we ll above 10 percent, the supervisory hourly wage rate has come down quite significantly, so  that the ratio of wages for supervisory or skilled work to that for lesser sk illed work is beginni ng to stabilize.  And that suggests that we’re beginning to ge t a little more pressure on lesser skilled wages an d somewhat less pressure on skilled wages.  These data are very interesting in the sense th at they’re based essentially on aggregated data, and they are something we never really  looked at previously.  But I think they tell us a great deal about what’s going on in the labor markets, and these da ta involve developments that we don’t ordinarily look at. This leads us to a very interesting question as to where policy should go from here.  Let’s say we knew for certain that inflationary expectations were held down and that core inflation was reasonably well suppressed .  The issue would still ar ise as to whether, with  this global phenomenon,                   69 of 100we are constructing a situa tion in which interest rate s are so low that we are encouraging, or indeed causing, underlying speculative activity that will create really serious imbalances in the overall system. So we’re dealing with a little more than the question of where inflation is going because, as I have mentioned previously, something that has become very eviden t in recent years is that overall asset prices worldwide, both equity and debt, are rising a good deal faster than product prices.  And they are picking up becaus e of—indeed, the rise in asset prices is being engendered by—the fact that interest rates are getting ever lowe r.  Interest rates in emerging-market economies ar e as low as one can remember.  An d aside from the surprisingl y high equity premium in th e United States, we have very significant upward momentum in asset values.  This is where the very im portant question of whether monetary policy should ta rget asset prices comes in.  Th e current situation is a very interesting case because I would say that we ought to be tightening at this particular point but not targeting the asset price increases.  But it is clearly  the potential for speculative activity—and its effect on asset prices—which is generating an assessment that we need to move, as far as evaluating the outlook for the overall economy. So where I come out on a ll of this is that unle ss we move a little to ti ghten up a bit further, I think we’re taking a risk of the sy stem beginning to run faster than we would like.  I conclude, as a consequence, that we need to move today.  I think we have to indica te, as the statemen t for alternative B suggests, that we’ll move again in January.  I would hope that after the statement comes out today the March futures for the federal fund s rate do not come down.  I woul d prefer that futures rates move up a bit, even if it’s our expecta tion—and it’s a plausible expectatio n—that the January increase will be the end of our tightening.  I can conceive of that occurring, but I think we have more here to be concerned about than just the bala nce of risks in the United States  and the issue of whether we are          70 of 100getting product price inflation or not, and I think the od ds are that we are not.  But we are running into the question of whether we  are opening up a very significant po tential for a major increase in asset expansion. Remember that  when we talk about li quidity, we’re talking about an increase in overall purchasing power; and common stocks as well as bonds are, in a sense, currency.  And if prices of bonds and stocks go up, that will result in a very high degree of li quidity in the system, which may or We have a global market and a global environm ent here, which I don’t think we yet fully understand. In fact, I know we do n’t fully understand.  Nevertheless, I think we need to tighten to be sure that we’re safe from these sp eculative incursions.  I believe th e risks of not doing so are far greater than tightening a li ttle bit more than pr obably in retrospect we wo uld have had to do.  So I think we ought to move forward.  My own personal view is that  we should not drop the word  “measured” from the statement because that would imply that we’r e really beginning to see developments out there that are moving very rapidly, and I think it’s too soon to conc lude that.  My arguments, I think, are largely precautionary in the sense that there is somethin g significant happening around the world that we cannot as yet fully explain, but it is one of the possible scen arios that has a high el ement of risk in it.  And I think we have to address ourselves to that just from  a risk management point of view. So I conclude that we ou ght to move the funds rate target up  25 basis points, which I think is the general consensus around here, and I believe the statement that we ha ve in “B” fulfills our objectives with regard to communicating that.  I w ould be cautious about indicating at any time that we are about to end the increases in the funds rate, even  though we may well be doing that, because that will bring mortgage rates do wn through the usual ef fect on the 10-year no te.  I think whatever froth there is in the housing mark et is becoming contained at this  stage, and it’s getting contained            71 of 100largely because mortgage rates have moved up and are beginning to have an  impact.  Remember, it’s not only the 30-year fixed rate but adjustable rates as well.  And short-term rates have moved up quite significantly and are impacting the market. If we can contain the presumptive housing bubble,  then we have a really remarkable run out there. But the real danger, in my judgment—where I thin k the risks lie—is in mo ving rates down too soon. When I say moving down, I mean that when we stop tightening, the long-term rates are going to come down.  And in my view we have to be careful about how that  happens and what  the impact is on the economy.  Indeed, our actions are going to have an impact on the world at large because they will affect what everybody does.  When I sit in the G-7 meetings, it’s very eviden t that what the Federal Reserve does with respect to policy has a qu ite significant impact on the ECB and the Bank of England. The reason I know that is they tell me that.  So, what we do  is going to be quite important.  So, my proposal is a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate target and the statement language of alternative B.  Who would like  to open up the discussion? 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I su pport your recommendation, an d I guess I can go with the language.  The one thing that your comments raised in my mind relates to row 3, the rationale part of the statement, where it talks about po ssible increases in resource utiliz ation.  I wonder if we shouldn’t have a statement that talks about the carry-on effe cts of past accommodativ e policy because that’s what you’re really talkin g about when you get into asset value issues.  I’m not saying we have to do that, but that came to my mind as  I listened to your comments.  Ot her than that, I’m fine with your proposal. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let me  just respond.  We have a problem if we move too quickly in changes that we make.  This  statement is a very significant change.              72 of 100MR. HOENIG.  Right.  I don ’t disagree with you.  That’s the only thing that occurred to me, but I’m fine with your proposal.  I think we need to keep going. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. I support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman, and I sup port alternative B. We’ve been engaged in a very cons tructive dialogue over the last week or two—or several weeks— about how to remove some of the el ements of our statement that have  been mainstays for some time.  I think it’s important for the rationale paragraph to end with a reference to inflation pressures remaining a concern.  I th ink the risk statem ent the way it’s formulated in  row 4 accomplishes its task in the most sensible and straightforw ard way, by clearly just stating ou tright what we th ink is going to be required to maintain balanced risks. With regard to the word “mea sured,” when it was originally deployed it clearly meant less than or equal to 25 basis points.  I’m not quite sure it retain s that strong an association to that.  I think it’s unlikely in the current situatio n that dropping “measured” woul d be interpreted as opening the door for a 50 basis point mo ve, but I don’t have a strong opinion one way or another.  So I’m happy either way regarding the word “measured.” Looking ahead, I think that the challenge for us is going to be how to communicate a reaction function, meaning how the pattern of  incoming economic data is goin g to map into our choice of a policy rate.  In particular, the cha llenge for us is going to be how to communi cate about that reaction function when we get to a point where we want to rest for a meeting or two.  Th at discussion is obviously for another day, but I th ink it will be importan t to avoid language at that time that encourages the public to place too high a probability on the rate re maining unchanged for an extended period. I say that because if the public thought we were locked in for a long  time, it might undesirably                73 of 100dampen the yield curve’s sensitivity  to incoming data.  That would be unfortunate.  So, those are my comments on the statement.  Agai n, I support your  recommendations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I support your recommendation, too.  You know, in th e e-mail discussions that have gone on with re gard to the various iterations of this statement, I think a lot of interesting ideas have come out.  And they al l revolve around where we are on  the spectrum in terms of the question: Are we close to the end of this current ti ghtening cycle?  Has the campaign really changed? And it’s a campaign with  a lot more forward momentum than so me of us might have agreed with. For quite a while I have been of the view that inflation tr ends, though they popped up with energy, seemed moderate ov erall on the core rate.  I’ve felt that  low underlying interest rates were encouraging risk-taking in markets that would be inappropriate at so me point.  And that’s been one reason why I’ve thou ght that the track we’ve been on now for thirteen meetings or so was the right track. I continue to believe  that.  And I was picking up some flavor of that in your discussion of your thinking; I have some sense of agre ement with what you said, to the ex tent that I foll owed all of it. So I’m in the camp that’s perfec tly comfortable with the alterna tive B formulation.  I’m not in the camp that thinks we might ne ed a new campaign here.  I would th ink that some further tightening is consistent with risk minimization, given over all market psychology right  now and given what we see in our forecast. As I thought about the various formulations of alternative B that we’ve been presented with, I thought there were a lot of different issues at stake, not just the word “m easured.”  One was whether we should remove the reference to  “accommodative.”  I ca me out on balance that  we should remove “accommodative,” given that I think we’re currently in a range wh ere we’re unsure that we will need a whole lot more tightening  and, therefore, we’re probably less accommodative than we were two or              74 of 100three meetings ago.  Removing “ac commodative” could be taken in th e other direction,  though.  By taking out “accommodative” markets could say, “Aha!  They are on a campaign upwards.” Regardless of where they think the current sense of policy is, they could believe that we might want to be even more aggressive.  But I think th e rest of the statement moderates that possibility sufficiently that taking out “accommodative” is  consistent with my thinking. Then there were some other alternatives that came up in the discussions back and forth.  We had been using productivity growth on the demand side as  a demand accelerator .  You can think of the way we see productivity growth currently as an expansion of supply and, therefore, a cushion against inflation.  And a couple of people did sugge st that.  To me that had some appeal.  I’m not going to suggest modifying the stat ement online or in the meeting here, but if we continue to see an expansion of productivity moving fo rward and it is a cushion against inflation, this is something we might want to think about as a factor to add to our assessment of  the current situation. Should we use the word “some” to modify “m easured policy firming” ?  A lot of people thought we should, and it en ded up getting into  alternative B.  I think th at’s the right way to go.  Should we retain “measured”?  I c ould live with “measure d” being there; I coul d live with  taking it out. With the use of “som e,” I think it’s a little easier  to keep it in because  to me it has less of a feeling that “measured” me ans more than a couple add itional policy ti ghtenings. And finally, the statement uses  “likely” in the reference to  further tightening moves—that “some further measured po licy firming is like ly to be needed.”  That may be a little more positive about the number of further moves than I’m comfortable with.  I can go with it.  I co uld also go with something like “some further measured policy fir ming may be needed,” whic h I think was President Fisher’s formulation.            75 of 100So all in all, I’m in agreement.  I think we could go either way on five or six of these different words.  Taken together, the proposed language says wh at I’d like to say.  Th at is, it says we’re at a point where there’s enough uncertainty about whethe r we’re accommodative or not that we can take “accommodative” out. And we’re sending a message th at we may tighten a co uple more times, but we’re certainly going to look at the data and weigh both of our und erlying goals.  So that’s a long-winded way of saying I ag ree with you.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chai rman.  I guess I’m going to be an outlier here.  Let me start by first saying that I agree w ith the 25 basis point increase.  As for the language, I think everyone in the room agrees that we don’t kn ow at this time what the path of policy is goi ng to be next year.  The data and the forecasts are going to determine that.  We’v e said this many, many  times.  So to me the objective of the statement is to give us maxi mum flexibility at th is point and not lo ck us into one course of action or another.  It should not give the impression that we’re necessarily very near the end of the tightening cycle. I agree with your comments in that I think the risks are skew ed toward the need for more tightening, and I think we have to be  very careful at this point for th e reasons that you mentioned.  To me alternative B in the Bluebook  goes much of the way toward accomplishing this.  I think it was artfully put together.   Now, to my ear—and I emphasize “to my”— the phrase “some furt her measured policy firming” might be interpre ted as implying that the sequence of rate hikes is nearly over.  There’s a possibility that it’s nearly over, but I don’t think there’s any assu rance that it wi ll be.  So my preference is to just say “further policy firming” w ithout either “some”  or “measured.”  But of the two words, if we take out one, I would take out “measured” at this point.  “Measured” is now interpreted             76 of 100in a way that I think is different from what we originally intended.  Now its primary meaning is only a 25 basis point increase at the next  meeting, and a ccording to Vincent’s memo, the market seems to think there’s a very high  probability of two more increases.  So in my ju dgment, since we’re now making major changes in the statement, this is a good opportun ity to remove the term “measured.”  I think it has outlived  its usefulness. As of today, we  will have increas ed the fed funds targ et thirteen times in  a row by 25 basis points.  So our statement signals further policy tigh tening, certainly, at the Ja nuary meeting.  And it’s difficult for me to unders tand, after we’ve moved the funds rate up thirteen times in a row by 25 basis points how market participants would expect us to increase it in January by more than 25 basis points, even without the term “measured” in there.  So in my judgment, this is the ideal time to take it out. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  If I could,  I’d like to respond to that  just to give you the other side of the argument.  Th e fact that we are making a significant change in the statement is the reason why they might conclude that we’r e also changing the 25  to 50, and I think th at we want to keep ourselves flexible in that  regard.  In my ju dgment, the risk of that inte rpretation getting into the why we can’t remove “measured” in January, for example.  In other words, there’s no rush to phase out the statement. By March this statemen t will be long since gone, having had— how would you put it?—a respectable interment or whatever.  [Laughte r]  But I think we’re underestimating the size of the change we’re making he re; we’re so used to mark ets not responding at all.  I think there’s a little more tentativeness out there.  Pe ople are not quite certain, which mean s that there is a greater chance of a strong market response.  Or perhaps more accurately, there is the chance that the market will respond in one way first and then 15 minutes later will go wholly in the other directio n.  We’ve seen that type of reaction in  the past.  We haven’ t seen that recently.          77 of 100I’m a little uncomfortable about th at phenomenon in this  context.  As you say, our knowledge at this point is a little sketchy in terms of what the market reaction will be.  But I can go  either way on the word “measured” myself.  I just  think it’s better to keep it in now and then take it out later. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. Well, I’ve thought about both si des of this a great deal, and I understand that argument. I just th ink we’re at the point where it’s better to  get all the changes behind us, so I’d do it now. That’s a judgment call. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If you can guarantee that th e market will—[Laughter]

MR. MOSKOW. If I could guarantee th at, I wouldn’t be here!  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with the recommendation to raise the federal funds rate target by ¼ percentage point, and I can accept the language in alternative B as it is drafted here. If I were the policy czar on this , I would make an ar gument to take out “measured” on the grounds that we want to at least alert market participants  to the prospect that  we’re getting close to ending the more or less automatic ¼ percentage point increases,  because we’re gettin g close to having removed all of the policy accommoda tion that we need to remove.  President Moskow made the other side of the argument for removing  “measured,” and I took  your comments as im plicitly working in the same direction.  So I think “measured” ought to come  out, if not at this meet ing, soon; it seems to me that it certainly has about outlived its usefulness. I would also, if I had my druthe rs, replace “likely” with just “m ay” or “may well.”  But as I said, I can accept this language as  drafted, because I don’t have an y special insights as to whether            78 of 100happens to react, the relatively prom pt release of the minutes will he lp because the market will get a more complete picture of our thinking within a relative ly short period of time. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I liste ned very carefully to what yo u said.  In 19 97, I sold my money management business because I figured I could no long er beat the house.  For 23 years I was a think it’s a very risky business for the FOMC to discuss how mone tary policy might impact asset prices. Yet you’re right in  terms of the power, the liquidity, and what that’s doing to affect real economic behavior, so I look forward to that discussion. In thinking about this statement, I want to vote for the ¼ point increas e announced in the first sentence.  I think the one-sentence statement in row 2 in a lternative B says all th at needs to be said— the economy is solid, period.  That’s good news.  In row 3, I would prefer to say why core inflation has stayed relatively low, because we talked about it at this table.  It has remained low for two reasons—because of competitive pr essures and still robust  growth in productiv ity, and I think we ought to insert that.  Thos e are the facts, and we just  talked about them  at length.  And I suggested that kind of language when  I sent in my note. In the wording of the assessment  of risks, I th ink there is an interesting trade here.  We’re taking out “accommodation,” which is a signal.  One could make the argumen t to remove the word “measured.”  I respect the arguments that were just made.  To mitigate the operative word “likely” I think we could achieve the objective by just sayi ng “further measured policy firming may be needed” rather than “is likely to be needed.”   That leaves us plenty of options , and I can honestly say that I feel it may be needed; I cannot honestly sa y it will likely be need ed.  But then, ag ain, I will no t have a vote next time.  Thank you.        79 of 100CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support the 25 basis point increase.  In my view, leaving “measured” in is wise because it provides continuity with  past statements.  Also, I think taking it out would be read as a hint to th e market that we would seriously c onsider a 50 basis point increase.  And I don’t think that’s necessary or desirable. I am inclined to believe that we should replace  “is likely to” with “m ay,” and my argument goes this way.  This is a chess game, and we have a bunch of moves ahead of us  here.  In terms of the likely policy adjustment in Januar y, I’m not willing to bet my h ouse—or even the equity in my house—but I am willing to make a $100 even-money bet that we’ll want to raise the funds rate another 25 basis points in January.  But as we go out furt her and look at March, I’d probably not make a $100 bet but a $30 bet.  And for May maybe onl y a $10 bet.  And the ques tion is: When is the best time to replace “is likely” with “may”?  If we do  it now, we can pretty much recycle the same statement, if we want to  do so, whereas if we we re to substitute “m ay” for “is likely” in January or to pass and not raise the funds rate next time.”  That may not be the signal we  want to send.  On the other hand, if we leave in the words “is likely,” at some point  we’re going to be faced with the problem of wanting to pass on a ra te increase but having said in the previous statement that an increase “is likely.”  So  that would be my argument for subs tituting “may” for “i s likely” at this meeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The only  thing I would say in response to that is that if we change “is likely” to “may” at this  meeting, we’re going to get a bo nd market rally, which we’re not going to find helpful in containing the speculation in the housing market .  So I think it’s more an issue not of what our intentions are but how the market  is likely—I shouldn’t use the word “likely”           80 of 100[laughter]—to react.  What we’re trying to do essentia lly is to get a soft land ing coming in from the top. Markets tend to ov er-respond, as we’ve seen too often.  Saying “may” implie s that we may not move in January, and th at will bring the structure of the yiel d curve down quite me asurably.  And I think that will open up house price speculation, which will create probl ems for us.  In my view, it is perfectly credible that we may choose to make January our last increase.  And if we do, as Brian said, we have the sentence in row 5 there.  That’s its purpose. Look, if this economy slows down significantly, the market s will adjust before our next meeting, and whatever we say will be almost irrelevant.  That’s what we’re dealing with.  It’s essentially playing the sh ort-term game and trying  to guess what the 10-year note is going to do relative to what we’re doing.  I ha ppen to think it’s a risk y activity, even though it’s perfectly credible that January could be our la st boost in th e funds rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I don’t disagree wi th that, and that’s why I said I would be willing to make a substantial bet that we wi ll want to increase the fu nds rate in January.  And I think it would be unfortunate to send a signal otherwise.  But I am worried about the sequence of these statements and the advantages of making minimal changes in order to avoid mislead ing the market.  What I’m saying is that there is a tension between those two objectives. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Well, I think we’re a ll in agreement that we want to get out from under this language as soon as feasible an d with as little di sruption as feasible.  And we’re guessing in a lot of areas. We ju st have no way of anticipating certain things.  We’re all going in the same direction.  The question is how fa st we get there.  Governor Ferguson. 

[SECTION]

MR. FERGUSON. Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  First, I accept your recommenda tion for a 25 basis point move.  On your analysis of asset prices, I think it is notabl e that over the last ten years—or more than ten years—we’ve had a great moderation in both GDP and al so inflation, but at the same              81 of 100time, as you point out, asset volatility hasn’t come  down.  Actually, the pric e level with respect to equities has gone up.  This  supports your thought th at going forward we’re like ly to be talking about asset prices more, w ithout targeting them. To the point of today’s discussion, I rather like a lternative B, after the back  and forth, as it sits on the page.  I think it is no longer fair to say that policy is accommoda tive.  I believe we are close to or well into the neutral range.  In  my view, most of the data that we’ve seen tend to support that notion.  If we take the reference to accommodative policy out, I think we do need to consider what is appropriate for section 4, the forward-looking lan guage.  And, in particular, the phraseology “some further measured policy firm ing is likely to be needed ” strikes me as ge tting just the righ t balance, as I think you were saying as well.  The word “measured” I think has come to mean 25 basis points, and I believe it’s important to hold on to th at notion if we take  out “accommodative.” Secondly, on the issue of how much  more we have to do , I tend to think it  may be one or two more moves, similar to the expectation built into the Greenbook and the mark et, which strikes me as appropriate in supporting the concep t of “some further.”  So, even though it’s a mouthful, I like the “some further measur ed policy firming.” On the “may” versus “is likely,”  I think it’s important to hold on to “is likely” because that’s actually our best judgment—that furthe r tightening is likely.  If we get into January and we are much less certain, then we can dial  it back to “may.”  But I think “is likely” is a mo re accurate signal and I would support that wording. And finally, though people don’t focus on it too much, we have the escape valve that you just talked about, the last sentence.  We’ve gone through lots of iterations of this statement back and forth.  One of our colleagues feels as though  he’s been in a great tragedy or  a comedy of erro rs.  [Laughter]            82 of 100But I think we’ve ended up in a reasonably good pl ace, and I’d like to stic k with the language of alternative B as writte n, as you proposed. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, let me say that I supp ort the 25 basis point increase today.  And I give my sy mpathy to Brian, who has heard our  many different viewpoints in the last week.  I think he has done  a good job of trying to get all our ideas out here in a reasonable balance. My initial feeling was that I really didn’t want to keep the word “measured” in the statement; I wanted to drop it as part of this cha nge.  But for the reasons ev erybody has suggested, I can accept the wording in a lternative B as it is now. Mr. Chairman, you talked about some of the risks to the long -term side of the market.  I think that is a serious concern because so  much of the pricing these days se ems not to involve looking at the longer-term risks, and it’s so critical to what is cu rrently driving investment and risk-taking.  And for that reason, I guess I’d like to leav e the words as they are now.  But the big change  that I would like to see is a move away from  forward-looking language as we ge t to the point where there is more uncertainty about future polic y.  It was easy for the la st thirteen meetings to say, “We’re on a trend; the funds rate is way too lo w and we have to get it back up.”  So it was easy for us to signal ahead.  But as we signaled ahead, th e market looked at what we were saying we we re going to do as opposed to what the data were saying we would do.  We, in effect, have take n the risk away from the market, especially at the long en d, because market participants think we ’re going to signal ahead of time and they will have time  to get out of their long positions. In my view, we should go back to structuring section 4 to say basica lly where we think the risk is. Then I’d take th e second part of that sentence and put it do wn in section 5, because it’s still a tautology to me. It still says we want to  attain the right balance.  We ll, there’s no way any of us                  83 of 100around this table is going to say that we’re not going to follow the mission of the Fed.  So if we’re going to put in a tautology, I’d put it in part 5.  An d in part 4 I’d just indicate our assessment of the risks—that we think the risk s are balanced or that the risk to grow th or for inflation is greater.  That would give the markets the message that they need to go back to looking at th e data to fi gure out what we’re going to do, rather than our laying out for them what our next policy moves are going to be.  As we get to the cusp, that risk pers pective is really important.  We sa w when we turned from the bottom and rates were heading back up agai n that it disrupted the markets.  But we need the markets to be ready to absorb that kind of risk because, as we sit around this table, we  do not know exactly how we’re going to engineer getting out of this pattern of moving 25 basis points at each meeting.  And I think the way to do it is to focus on where we see the risks and to stop giving any kind of signal on what our likely moves are going forward.  I would like to see that happen  at the next meeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Olson. 

[SECTION]

MR. OLSON. Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  First of all, I support the ¼ point increase.  We have passed over fairly quickly, except for a co uple of instances, the impact of removing the “accommodative” language, wh ich I think is very significant.  And I am reminded,  based on past experience, that when we make multi ple changes in our statement, ther e is a greater lik elihood that the On the decision of whether to include or exclude the word “measured” from the language, initially I was ambivale nt.  But after hearing the di scussion, I wanted to make sure that if  we removed it, we also had lang uage that took off the tabl e the possibility of a 50 basis point move.  So I was intrigued by Brian’s suggestion of—I  don’t know what to call it—a ge ntle jettisoning of  the term, and I think on balance I am in favor of keeping it.  So I am su pporting both the ¼ point move and alternative B as written.           84 of 100CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Santomero. 

[SECTION]

MR. SANTOMERO.  Mr. Chairman, I support the proposal  to raise the fed funds rate 25 basis points.  As to the language itself, I supported the first cha nge we had to alternative B.  Since that time, we’ve played around, if you will, with some  of the wording, and I worry a little ab out wordsmanship by 19 people over time.  I’m not sure  how stable that is.  So, rather than being one of the 19, I’m very happy with the language as it stands. On the issue of “measured,” I ca me into this Committ ee meeting somewhat reluctant to retain that word in the statement. I was taken by your explan ation of the likely market reaction and, on further thought, I suppor t retaining that word as  well.  So I’m quite ha ppy with where we are. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  I support your pr oposition to tight en policy by 25 basis points today.  And I agree w ith you that we’ll probably have to  move in January, with a good deal of uncertainty about where we ’ll go after that.  If I could de sign the market reaction to our announcement—which I know from  long experience I can’t—I would leave rates about unchanged when we’re finished, with some probability of  tightening past Ja nuary, but not 100 pe rcent.  Like you, I think we’re at a point wh ere the momentum in dema nd and the level of resource utilization are such that if we’re going to make a mist ake, we ought to err a bit on the side of going too far rather than stopping too soon. Exactly what the role of asset prices is in that is a much more difficult issue.  I certainly see asset prices playing through to the macroeconomic situation, as you said—in particular, housing prices and the way they have stimulated not on ly residential construction but consumption more generally.  And as I said in my remarks, I think we need to see some sign that that market is cooling off. So, in that regard, I agree that asset prices are critical to the outlook.  Whet her I would worry            85 of 100about imbalances an d put a little more emphasis on them, aside fro m the macro outlook, I think is a much more difficult question. In terms of the language, despite my expansiv e reading of the word “accommodative” at the last meeting, I support it s deletion from the announ cement and the wording of alternative B.  I don’t think we have to go to a restrict ive policy in this firming cycle,  which I would define as a policy designed to cause the economy to run below potential in order to reduce inflation.  I think I’ve just been reinforced in that judgment by  the recent data on costs and prices .  But we don’t need to get into linguistic hair-splitting to make our point abou t what we intend to  do.  I support taki ng attention off of a precise definition of “n eutral,” which rema ins a shifting and elusive quarry .  And that was inherent in the use of the word “accommodative.” In terms of the wording of the statement itself, I like alternative B as it  is currently worded.  I agree with you that moving from “is likely” to “may” would signal th at we are about to stop, or that we think the odds are at best 50/50 that we’ll move again, and we would have a heck of a rally in financial markets.  And as I said, I’d prefer to leave markets unch anged at the end of this.  So I would go with “is likely” at this point, given my expectations, and save moving to “may” for the January meeting, if we think the odds are 50/50 for March. As for the word “measured, ” I would prefer to keep  it in the statement.  To me, it means that we think we’ll be moving in 25 ba sis point increments, an d I do believe that’s our intention.  I’d be concerned that omitting it would be interpreted as an indication that the Co mmittee would be looking at the possibility of moving in 50 basis point increments, and I don’t think that’s what we intend to do.  In the phrase “measured pace,” I thought it was the word “pace” that tended to  carry the concept of a series of moves, rather than the word “measured,”  which, to me, meant 25 .  So I’m in favor of dropping “pace” an d keeping “measured.”  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.         86 of 100CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.  I support your recomme ndation of a 25 basis point increase in our fed funds rate target.  I can also accept the language in alternative B.  Like others, though, I came to the mee ting preferring to remove the word  “measured.”  But I didn’t see removing the term “measured” in the way Brian did—that it meant markets might think we would go up at a faster pace of 50 ba sis points.  I thought  that its removal wo uld give us more flexibility to stop at a certain point.  It’s interesting, in listening to  this conversation today, th at we all have different interpretations of what it would mean.  So I am just  going to go with your guidance.  Nevertheless, given what I know today, I’ m leaning to the view that we’re going to have to stop at some point soon versus having concern that we’re going to have to do more.  But again, give n what I’ve heard today and given your recommendation , I support the language as written in alternative B. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President Yellen. 

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I suppo rt a 25 basis point increase today and I also support the language in alternative B.  It s eems to me that the framew ork in “B” maintains  its existing form and also offers forward-looking guidance.  I thin k we’ve had a very constructive process, much to my surprise, in the way 19 people have taken turn s at drafting a statement that has evolved really quite nicely.  The statement has the potential to evolve further next month and in likely” to “may,” or possi bly excluding “measured.” For today, I guess I’m comfortabl e keeping “measured. ”  I think there are arguments on both sides of it.  I think it is importa nt to signal that we have no intention of doing something more aggressive than a 25 basis point move.  On the downside, as Pr esident Pianalto said, when you combine “measured” with “is likely” and simulta neously remove “accomm odation,” markets may             87 of 100conclude that we have in mind  at least two more steps, maybe more.  And potentially removing “accommodative” may signal that we intend to go beyond ne utral into a restrictive stance. But it’s really hard to interpret how the markets are going to react to th is.  And frankly, I think this statement comes as cl ose as we can get to doing  what I would like to see today, which is to essentially validate the expectations that are curren tly in the markets and in  the Greenbook.  Those expectations are that we are highly likely or almost certain  to move another 25 ba sis points next time and that what we will do in March and beyond is an open question .  I think this is not a statement that is likely to bring long- term rates down, although  we will see shortly.  On the issue of asset prices, I would simply second the comments that Governor Kohn made about them.  It’s a to pic for greater discussion in the future. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, I too support the recommendation for a 25 basis point increase.  I’m sure that the process we went through on revisi ng the language in the statement was frustrating to the staff but I actually found it bo th interesting and constructive.  When we’re making changes as significant as we are today, I think there should be some wa y for all of us to c ontribute to the ideas and to see each other’s ideas. So again, as frustrating as I’m sure it was, I found it  constructive. There’s a lot to like abou t alternative B, and I support it as well.  I’ll limit my  comments just to the words in play. Actually, my comments on the draft statemen t language last week indicated a support for leaving “policy accommo dation” in.  My thin king was—and I still be lieve this—that we really haven’t moved through whatever the neutral point is to pure tightening.  I have a little bit of concern that markets will interpret it that way and assume that we’ve gotten be hind and, therefore, are ratcheting things up.  But I like  Brian’s comment that there comes a time to honorably discharge            88 of 100words and phrases from serv ice.  And since it’s so ha rd to measure, and even  more difficu lt to talk about, I think it is time to get that out of the statement. I actually think there’s no cost to leaving in “measured” in row 4.  Although I think the probability is very small of  its removal being misinterpr eted as an opportunity fo r us to move faster, to me it’s much better to leav e it in.  I have a strong preference for leaving the next line as it is, with “is likely” instead of “may.”  I think that’s where we are, and I’d much prefer that the wording stay that way.  I assume we’re going to ha ve other substantial changes to th e statement in coming months.  I just hope we can find a way either before the meeting or during the meeting to have a chance to share our views and see each other’s ideas, as messy as it is .  I think we come out in  a better place when we do that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  Vice Chair. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation to move 25 basis points and I support the langua ge in alternative B.  I think it’s a nice, balanced formulation, and I do believe it’s the best way to leav e expectations roughly neutral. I think we view the probability as  very high that  we’re going to need to  move in January and that March is maybe an ev en bet.  That seems abou t right.  This probably introduces a little bit more uncertainty into the signal about monetary policy than has been the case before, but I think that’s desirable.  It’s a fairly flexible formulation and allows us  to adapt reasonably easily going forward.  I agree that “may” would carry too mu ch risk of taking out a good d eal of the tightening that is now built into the mark et, and, therefore, I don’t th ink it would be desirable. The problem with “measured,” of course, is that in our discussi on there is so much dispersion on how we interpret the imp lication of “measured” toda y that it’s a little hard to  justify retaining it.  Nevertheless, I’m comfortable retaining it because  it has two virtues that are not necessarily           89 of 100inconsistent.  One is that it does keep a bit of a cap on expectations about how much and how fast we need to move, and I think that’s pr obably desirable now.  The second implication it carri es is the sense that we may be facing two more m oves rather than just on e.  Again, I think that ’s desirable now, too; so, on balance, it makes sense to me to keep it. Also, I just want to echo what many of you have sa id in that I agree that this was a pretty good process.  Committees sometimes have a bad name.  We were a group of seventeen people this time and I thought the process wa s quite good.  I think the language got better throug h the evolution of this statement, and that makes me  more hopeful.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.  We are going to be voting only on the directive and the assessment of risks; therefore, we needed a second view of the Committee on the statement itself.  It turns out that the critical word there that has been in dispute, and which Bria n was unable to resolve, was the word “measured.”  And it had the advantage of not changing the rest of the statement either way—whether it was in or it was out.  In the event, a significant majority seems to be in favor of leaving “measured” in. He nce, we will vote on the directive and the assessment of risks, and if that gets an affirmative vote, we will presume that the language for the statemen t shown under alternative B is acceptable as well.  So , why don’t you read  “B” and the asse ssment of risks. 

[SECTION]

MS. DANKER. I’ll be reading th e directive wording from the Bluebook and the assessment of risks from alternative B in exhibit 2 from Brian’s presentati on.  “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary  and financial conditions  that will foster pr ice stability and promote sustainable growth in ou tput.  To furthe r its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent  with increasing the fe deral funds rate to an average of around 4¼ percent.”  And the wording for the assessment of risks:  “The Committee judges that some further measured  policy firming is likely to be ne eded to keep the risks to the                                        90 of 100attainment of both sustai nable economic growth  and price stability roughly in balance.  In any event, the Committee will resp ond to changes in economic  prospects as needed to foster these objectives.”
