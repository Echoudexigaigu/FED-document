CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I’d like to we lcome President Plosser to the table.

MR. PLOSSER. Thank you very much.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Charlie, welcome aboard.  Let’s start with the Desk operations. Mr. Kos. MR. KOS.1 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At your  last meeting I focused on the higher level of volatility that  was concentrated in specific and fairly narrow asset classes, particularly emerging market curre ncies and equities.  In the intermeeting period, volatility declined in those asset classes while stay ing low in a broader set of asset markets such as fixed income and the major currency pairs.  Meanwhile, the take a pass in raising rates at this meeting, even as many other central banks were tightening policy further. On the first page of the handout, the top panel graphs the historical volatility of the MSCI equity indexes for the United States, Europe, Japan, and emerging markets.  These volatilities rose after your May m eeting and peaked around the time of your 20 percent. On balance, the value of emerging market equities and currencies rebounded somewhat after the selloff in May and June.  The middle left panel graphs the VIX index. Although a tad higher than the very low levels observed earlier this year, the VIX is well off its highs and be low its long-term historical average.  Similarly, the middle right panel graphs an index of volatility in Treasury yields.  This index has been very tame for severa l quarters despite the widely reported uncertainty about the future direction of  monetary policy.  Rounding out this benign picture is the currency market, as reflect ed in the bottom panels, where volatility briefly ticked up in the spring but since th en has quickly fallen to earlier levels. Even though volatilities on ba lance trended lower since the last meeting, trading volumes—as measured by the primary electron ic brokering services in fixed-income and currency markets—declined more than can be explained by the summer doldrums.  Some market participants suggest  that speculators reduced risk in May and early June and are now sitting on their hands. In that scenario, risk appetite is still ebbing even if that is not showing up in  wider spreads or higher volatilities. If investors and speculators are being more cautious, one reason for the caution might be related to the tightening of m onetary conditions globally.  The table on 1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). 3 of 158         rates so far in 2006. Last Thursday the Bank of England surprised the market by increasing rates 25 basis poi nts, while the European Central Bank ratified expectations by also tightening 25 basis poi nts.  Of particular note among central banks that have recently raised interest rates is the Bank of Japan, which on July 14 moved the target overnight cal l rate from 0 to 25 basis points, as shown in the bottom panel. The move had been well telegra phed.  Nevertheless, the aggregate current account balance at the BOJ is still higher than required reserves of 5 trillion to 6 trillion yen. The main reason seems to be that Japan Post continues to hold high and variable balances, thus bumping up the aggregate.    While the backdrop globally is toward ti ghter monetary conditions, investors in the United States have been looking forward to a plateauing of s hort-term interest rates or even a decline over the medium te rm as housing and other indicators have weakened. The prospect of a pause in th e tightening cycle reportedly helped support equity prices, shown in the top panel on pa ge 3, which inched higher as this meeting approached. Corporate profits on the S&P 500 for Q2 have risen 19 percent, higher than analysts’ forecasts. In fact, profits have risen by double digits seventeen quarters in a row. With the prospect  of a pause and strong prof its, one might wonder why the price action in equities has been on the sloppy side.  The most common answer is that the outlook that companies are providing is  cautious, perhaps suggesting that the economy is softening more quickly than previously forecast.  Continuing on that theme, the middle panel graphs the two-year and ten-year Treasury yields and the target fed funds rate. Two-year and ten- year Treasury yields are down about 30 basis points, to about 4.9 percent, and roughly 35 basis points below the funds rate.  Such an inversion is common during an easing cycle but very rare during a tightening cycle. As shown in the bottom panel, br eakeven rates have barely budged since the last FOMC meeting.  The entire decline in nominal yields represents a fall in real rates. Taken at face value, this suggests  that investors may see lower real returns ahead, perhaps reflecting a bearish view of the economy.  However, that bearishness on the economy is not spilling over to an e xpectation that inflation will necessarily fall back. The top panel on page 4 graphs the Libor fixing rate for three- month deposits (the thick red line) and three-, six-, and nine-m onth forward rate agreements.  In recent days the nine-month forward traded through the cash rate, sugge sting—if one takes this literally—that the markets are beginni ng to contemplate an easing of policy in early 2007. This pattern is similar but not identical to what we observed in 2000, as shown in the middle panel.  After the Co mmittee raised the funds rate in May 2000— in what turned out to be th e last move in the cycle—forward rates began to decline even though the Committee continued with an asymmetric bias to tighten.  By Eurodollar futures calendar spreads.  The bottom left panel graphs the difference between the December 2007 and the December 2006 Eurodollar contracts.  Late last year that spread turned negative, implying that market participants expected interest rates to be lower at the end of 2007 th an at the end of 2006.  After reversing somewhat, the spread turned sharply downward in recent months.  The bottom right 4 of 158          panel graphs the spread between th e December 2001 and the December 2000 contracts from late 1999 through September 2000.  The spread turned negative only with anecdotal reports of a sharp drop  in orders around September, which was roughly three months after the last tightening.    Shifting gears, I want to mention briefl y the transition on July  20 to the new PSR (payment system risk) policy.  The first major P&I (principal a nd interest) date under the new rules was July 25. Fannie M ae had to fund $40 billion in MBS P&I payments (net of payments to itself), and the transition went very smoothly.  One of the tools that GSEs developed to help fund their accounts on a timely basis on large P&I dates are term and overnight early re turns of fed funds sales.  Under these contracts, fed funds must be  returned to them earlier than the end-of-day deadline associated with standard fed funds sales,  usually between 9:30 a.m. and 11 a.m.  Rates on overnight ear ly-return fed funds have trad ed roughly 1 to 3 basis points below standard fed funds. Based on incomplete sampling, about 15 percent of the volume of brokered fed funds reported to the Desk and used to calculate the daily effective rate has been early returns.  The Desk is collecti ng and monitoring early-return fed funds data from the major brokers  to assess how this market develops and how early-return fed funds may affe ct the overall fed funds market. There were no foreign operations in the period, and I will need a vote to approve domestic operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. The tr ansition to the new PSR policy is good news. Are there any questions for Mr. Kos?  If not, we need a motion to approve operations.  So moved, without objection. We  turn now to the economic situation.  Mr. Wilcox.

MR. WILCOX.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Jack Brickhouse, the voice of the Chicago Cubs for more than thirty years, was more widely known for his knowledge of baseball than for his command of proba bility.  When a Cub w ould step into the batter’s box after an especially long string of hitless trips to the plate, Brickhouse would invariably declare, “He’s due.” Ev en we kids knew in our minds that Jack didn’t have it quite right on the probability  front, but in our hearts it was enough to keep us going. Some of you may remember that an employment report was released on the Friday after the June meeting, and that  time, we pretty much nailed it.  So I have to admit to having had a “Brick house moment” last Friday and wondering whether we were “due” this time for a real trainwreck.  But for a second time in a row, fate smiled, as it so rarely seems to do on macro forecasters.  So at the end of today’s meeting, I’ll be happy to pass the baton back to Dave Stockton but with a certain sense of guilt:  He’s really due. [Laughter] In fact, as we reported to the Board ye sterday, Friday’s labor market report came in very much as expected.  Private n onfarm payrolls increased an estimated 113,000 in July, virtually the same as the 100,000 we had been expecting, and the gains in 5 of 158        each of the previous two months were revised up by a modest 20,000.  The unemployment rate rounded up to 4.8 per cent, but unless we receive additional evidence of a more-rapid slackening of conditions in the labor market, we’re inclined to stick with our Greenbook trajectory for th e unemployment rate as well.  Overall, we made no material adjustments to our macro forecast in light of this news on the labor market.  Indeed, I would argue th at there was less news in the August Greenbook than met the eye.  The quick summ ary of the August projection is that the pressures on resource utilizati on look roughly the same to us as they did at the time of the June Greenbook, whereas the outlook for in flation looks just a shade worse.   Turning first to the issue of resource u tilization, the clearest  indication of our thinking in this regard is that the une mployment rate in the August Greenbook never deviates more than 0.1 percentage point from our forecast in the June Greenbook.  To put a very fine line on the matter, we nudged the path down ever so slightly over most of the forecast period, and that  call still looks about right to us, even in the wake of Friday’s report. Given an unrevised estimate of the NAIRU, the slightly lower level of the unemployment rate implies that the pressures on resource utilization are just a little greater in this  Greenbook than they were in the last one. At the same time, we have become a b it more pessimistic about the outlook for the growth of aggregate demand relative to potential over the next six quarters.  This slightly greater pessimism derives from seve ral considerations.  Most notably, starts and especially permits for the construction of single-family homes came in below our expectations in June, and we responded by taking our projection for residential construction down over the entire projecti on period.  In the June Greenbook, our projection ran above the simula ted trajectory from our pref erred model for starts, in recognition of the persistent  upside errors that model had been making.  Now, for what it’s worth, our judgmental forecast ha ppens to be in line with the simulation from that model that jumps off from the last  quarter of data.  Parenthetically, I might note that the simulations from that model did not revise greatly over the past six weeks. We still see the contraction in residential construction as moderate by historical standards but likely to be a little steeper than we  anticipated in June.  This time, we forecast that single-family starts  will bottom out at an annual rate of 1.43 million units, bringing the overall decline fr om last summer’s peak to 18 percent, still well shy of the declines that were registered in the ea rly 1980s and early 1990s but starting to be in the same ballpar k.  We also took on board the growth implications of the further run-up in oil pr ices since the June meeting, the somewhat lower level of household wealth implied by the downward-revised trajectory for house prices, and the likelihood that greater  inventory investment in the second quarter robbed a smidgen of growth from the future. All that said, the adjustments to our fo recast of resource utilization are pretty averaged 0.5 percentage point  over the second half of th is year and 0.4 percentage point next year. But here, of course, the changes were driven by the adjustments we made to the supply side of our projecti on.  In its annual revi sion of the national 6 of 158         income and product accounts, the BEA trimme d the average pace of growth of real GDP from 2003 through 2005 about  0.3 percentage point.  Because our fundamental views of the pressures on resource utiliza tion and the rate of in flation were unchanged by the NIPA revision, the simplest thing fo r us to do would have been to take potential GDP down by a like-sized amount, thereby keeping the GDP gap the same as before. As we often do, however, we ma de a further adjustment to potential in order to bring the output gap into line with the unemployment rate gap at the end of last year thereby eliminating a tension between those two “gap” variables that had become more distracting than informative.  As for the forecast, in line with our usual practice, we overlaid the othe r factors that I discussed earlier with a 0.3 percentage point adjustment for the reduction in the growth of potential, on the theory that households and businesses anchor their spending plans around their longer-term prospects for income.   A central issue that we wrestled with in this forecast round was whether the slowdown in growth that we anticipate will materialize to the degree that we expect.  The dimensions of that slowdown are si gnificant.  Looking ahead six quarters and behind by the same amount helps smooth through some of the quarter-to-quarter wiggles. We estimate that, over the past six quarters, real GDP growth exceeded potential growth, on average, about ¾ percen tage point at an annual rate; we expect real GDP growth over the ne xt six quarters to fall short  of potential by roughly the same amount.  One key factor driving this sw ing in our forecast is the combination of a waning boost to consumption from house hold net worth and the higher level of interest rates.  The result is reflected in our forecast for the personal saving rate.  Again using the same six-quarter window, fore  and aft, over the pa st six quarters, the saving rate declined more th an 2 percentage points; we expect that between now and the end of 2007 the smaller gains in wealth and higher interest rates will bring the saving rate back up to 2 percen t.  Another key factor, especi ally in the near term, is the slowdown in residential investment. After chipping only about ¼ percentage point from the growth of real GDP during the first half of this year, residential investment is expected to slice about ¾ per centage point from the growth of real GDP over the second half of this year. Next year , the drag from this sector should have diminished but not halted altogether.  Fina lly, we think that th e sum of public and private spending related to last year’s hurri canes will top out sometime this year and will begin to drift down, accentuating the dow ndraft from the other factors weighing on demand.  We have assumed that, within the aggregate of to tal hurricane spending, government spending and the replacement of destroyed equipment have been relatively front-loaded, whereas construction ac tivity, we presume, is still ramping up. Turning to inflation, the news is relatively  slight but not of the welcome variety.  As you know from the Greenbook, we mark ed up our projection for core PCE inflation over the second half of this y ear about ¼ percentage  point and nudged the forecast for next year up a tenth.  The la rgest single factor accounting for these upward revisions was the further deteriorat ion during the intermeeting period in the outlook for energy prices; the pass-through of these prices adds about a tenth to our projection of core inflation during the second half of this year and about half a tenth 7 of 158           next year. Owners’ eq uivalent rent surprised us once again to the upside in the most recent CPI release, and we extended forward some of that unfavorable news.  Other sources of upward revision, each small but toge ther big enough to generate just a little upward nudge to our projection, included sligh tly higher near-term core import prices and slightly weaker stru ctural productivity growth. As before, we continue to see core in flation stepping down next year compared with this year, almost entirely because of  the flattening out we have projected for energy and other commodity prices: We ha ve the increases in those prices adding about 0.4 percentage point to our forecast of  core PCE inflation this year, and we have them adding just 0.1 percentage point  next year.  Provided that this year’s shocks do not get built into inflation expectations going forward, this removal of upward impetus should be enough to give core inflation a downward tilt.  In closing, I might briefly mention that “speed effects” do not play an important role in shaping our outlook for inflation. The slowdown in  growth operates first by bringing output down from above potential to right in line with potential by sometime during the first half of next year and then by moving out put below potential ove r the remainder of 2007. For 2007 as a whole, output is so close to potential as to be roughly a neutral factor for inflation. If growth were to proceed at a subpar pace into 2008, the resulting gap in resource utilization coul d begin to place some downward pressure on inflation. Karen will now continue our presentation. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. From the perspective of the global economy, one of the important revisions in this forecast from last  time is the projected path for crude oil prices. We have incorporated into the baseline forecast a path for both West Texas intermediate (WTI) prices and the U.S. oil im port price that is more than $5 per barrel higher in the fourth quarter of this year and nearly $7 higher by the fourth quarter of next year than was the case in the June Gr eenbook.  It is still tr ue, however, that the projected path, based as usual on market fu tures prices at the time the forecast was made final, is quite flat.   The sizable jump in oil prices this time re flects the volatility that we have seen in finalized. Spot prices for WTI moved from  below $70 per barrel at that time to a recent peak of $77 in mid-July and again yesterday, following BP’s announcement that pipeline repair in Alas ka will shut in about 400,000 ba rrels per day of crude oil.  Price fluctuations during the intermeeting period reflected market concerns about the potential effect on supply of ongoing events in the Middle East, some disruptions to production in Nigeria, and a s light reduction in output by Sa udi Arabia, as well as an awareness that hurricane season has arrived. No doubt the underlying strength of the global economy is contributing by maintaini ng overall demand as well.  As of close of business yesterday, the futures path for WT I oil prices during the remainder of this year and next year was about $2 per ba rrel above the Greenbook baseline path.  Clearly, further moves in oil pri ces are a risk to the forecast. 8 of 158        Another important element in the foreign outlook is the continued elevated level of nonfuel commodity prices, especially the i ndustrial metals.  Me tals prices are down from their highs in May, but they are also  up from their near-term lows in June.  During the intermeeting period, sp ot prices for copper and zi nc rose through mid-July and then partially reversed th eir recent increases but sinc e have moved up again.  On balance, metals prices are modestly hi gher since the time of the June Greenbook, but prices of other primary commodities are some what lower.  As a result, our projected path for nonfuel commodity prices in this forecas t is very similar to that of last time.  The elevated level of these prices means that they will continue to have lagged effects on U.S. import and export price inflation for a time.  The flatness of the path going forward means that we anticipate that the im plications for import price inflation will abate noticeably in 2007, contributing to a shar p drop in the rate of inflation for core imports.  Further fluctuation in the prices for these global commodities is also a risk to our baseline forecast. These developments in global commodity  prices, both fuel and nonfuel, along with other data released over the intermee ting period, led us to revise up some our forecast for inflation abroad through mid-2007.  We expect that the upward pressures on inflation in the industrial countries will be  felt in the near term, particularly this quarter, whereas those in the emerging market economies will be evident later this year and into next. The revisions are sm all, in part because foreign industrial countries have to date been very successful  at containing the inflation consequences of higher crude oil prices and several have  tightened monetary policy and in part because emerging market economies have continued to suppress domestic energy prices, delaying their effects in the proce ss.  Some monetary policy tightening has also been implemented by a number of Asian central banks. We continue to read the evidence for foreign real GDP growth as indicating a solid pace of expansion, with  the possible exception of Ca nada, where output growth slowed in the second quarter. We have fi ne-tuned our outlook for expansion abroad a bit—strengthening last quarter and this quart er and lessening the pace just a little next year; but the overall path for foreign real  GDP is about the same as in June.   Indicators from most of our important trading partners—for example, from Japan, the euro area, and China—suggest consider able momentum in foreign economic expansion at the present time.   Global financial markets confirm a gene rally favorable climate for continued strong growth, and many of the signs of increased risk concerns and heightened volatility from earlier in the year have fa ded.  Over the intermeeting period, stock prices in many of our trading partners have  risen.  Equity pric e indexes in emerging generally have not returned to  the levels reached in early May.  Other than in the United Kingdom and Japan, yields on ten- year sovereign bonds have moved down 10 or more basis points in the major fore ign industrial countries since your June meeting, and spreads on dollar-denominated  emerging market sovereign debt have partially retraced previous increases and are not far above the lows observed in early 9 of 158             May, with the exception of spreads for Turkis h debt.  On balance, the dollar is down just a little over the period. The bottom line is that the staff’s picture of the global economy implies an essentially neutral effect of  the external sector on U.S.  GDP growth over the forecast period, although one must remember that there are risks on both sides to that picture.  The arithmetic contribution of real net exports  to GDP growth for the rest of this year and next year is essentially zero—with a small positive contribution over the second half of this year, unusual for us, followe d by a small negative contribution in 2007 as a whole. Exports of both goods and services  are expected to grow strongly, supported by steady expansion of real GDP growth ab road.  The step-down in U.S. real GDP growth should restrain import growth somewhat over the next six quarters. The nominal trade deficit on goods and services is projected to widen about $75 billion from the estimated figure for th e second quarter to th at for the fourth quarter of 2007. The change in the non-oil nominal trade balance accounts for only one-third of that $75 billion. This change in the overall trade balance is sufficiently small that the projected ratio of the trade de ficit to GDP is steady at about 6 percent.  Nevertheless, the current account deficit is projected to exceed $1 trillion at the end of 2007, and the ratio of the cu rrent account deficit to GDP  rises from 6.5 percent to 7 percent next year. A growing net deficit in investment income flows largely explains the further deterioration in the curr ent account balance.  That change, in turn, is accounted for by a substantial widening of the deficit on portfolio income that more than offsets a gain in the balance of di rect investment income.  The financing requirements of our external deficit remain large and will continue to grow as long as the level of the trade balance remains far from zero.  David and I will be happy to answer any questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you very mu ch.  Are there questions for David or Karen?  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I’d like to put a question to  you, but I want to do it in the form of an observation that I’d like you to co mment on.  It has to do with the inflation situation.  Obviously, we are not in a situation anything remotely like that of the 1970s, but I do believe that we have very generalized inflation across sectors and across regions of the world.  Let me support that statement in the following way.  In the overall nu mbers, the core PCE is at or above 2 percent— or was in ’04 and ’05 and is projected for ’06 a nd ’07.  So this number is for a four-year period— it’s not a little flash in the pan.  The inflation projections abroad have been shaded up. I think 10 of 158          you commented explicitly to that effect.  Import and export prices are being revised up a bit.  The revisions are not huge, but they are all in the sa me direction.  Dollar depreciation would tend to promote higher prices.  I’ve looked at the disaggregated CPI for the twelve months ending in June of this year versus the twelve months ending in June 2005—s o it’s a year-over-year comparison.  When we look at the components—I won’t go through all of them—we know what’s happening to owners’ equivalent rent. We know what is happening to the energy part of it.  Household furnishings and operations are up; apparel is up. The major th ings going down are actually new vehicles and used vehicles, which are tending to hold the CPI down.  Public transportation is up; medical care commodities are up; and there is a very small decline in medical care services.  Other goods and services, communications, and recr eation are all up.  Education is up just a bit. The upward revision is very generalized across almost all sectors of the CPI.  Then, on the cost side, we’re going to have this big upward revision in unit la bor costs.  By the way, were the unit labor costs released this morning? 

[SECTION]

DAVID WILCOX.  They should have been released by 8:30, I think. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Maybe we’ll see what happene d there during the break.  My argument is that we have very generalized  inflation pressure across regions of the world and across commodity and service sectors. The pressure  is not isolated.  Could you comment on that observation? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Broadly, I don’t disagree that  the acceleration in consumer prices is broadly based. It is sensitive to sample period.  Michael Kiley’s briefing yesterday to the Board touched on some of the same issues and presente d an exhibit that displayed the median CPI as constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Clev eland and the trimmed mean constructed by the 11 of 158          Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Both of thos e measures, which are al ternative attempts to capture the central tendency of inflation rates,  have also moved up notably, most of all from 2003. I guess I would remind you that we were a littl e puzzled as to why inflation was as low as it was in 2003. It fell below our model simulations.  We have never been able to come up with a fully satisfactory explanation for why it got as lo w as it did.  So if you use 2003 as your base for comparison with the present, the trend looks very worrisome.  If you smooth through that—I don’t know that “anomaly” is the right word—une xplained dip in 2003, you are left with a trend that by any of these measures has moved up.  The particular comparison that we chose to highlight yesterday in the briefing to the Board emphasized the acceleration in housing services, but other components have played  a role as well.  We also think that the energy-price pass-through into core has played a broadly diffuse role in giving some upward impetus to core inflation. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. If I could just comment on the worldwide aspect of your point, I’d say that the one piece that’s missing is that globally we have not seen th is inflation pressure translate into an acceleration in wages and labor compen sation—not so much here in the United States and not in rest of the world. Even in places where central banks are tightening monetary policy in recognition of the inflation that they are experiencing in their consumer prices, one is not hearing stories about an acceleration of wages.   So there’s truth in everything you’ve said, and I wouldn’t disagree that it’s worrisome, but we’ve seen huge changes in the structure of global economic activity.  Those changes may have effected significant changes in relative prices, particularly  of energy on the one hand and of other kinds of primary commodities on the other.  We keep saying that those price changes are going to end, right? Every FOMC I come here, a nd I tell you that those pr ices are flattening out 12 of 158         starting this morning. [Laughter] Then I come  back six weeks later, and I say it again—and that’s not lost on me. However, there is a question in my mind as to  trend versus relative price effects here, and I think there are surely some of both types of effects.  It may be wrong to attribute the pressure entirely to a relative price shock that’s going to  go away immediately, but it’s certainly also wrong to call it all inflation trend with no relative price component. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Now that I’ve had a chance to take a breath—another factor that obviously is critical is the be havior of inflation expectati ons.  As you know, the Survey of Professional Forecasters long-term measure has been flat, immovable, at 2½ percent.  The University of Michigan survey—which we show  in the Greenbook table back to 2004—was at 2.8 percent, on the median measure, in the second  half of 2004, and it is at 2.9 percent in June and July of this year. So long-term inflation expectations have really been remarkably well contained. Shorter-term inflati on expectations have fluctuated more with changes in overall consumer prices, and they are up a couple of tent hs from the end of 2004.  But there hasn’t been a lot of upward drift in measur es of inflation expectations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  President Poole asked a significant part of my  question, or he presented a significant part of my questi on.  [Laughter]  But let me ask you about the markup part of this.  You know, we have always thought that there was a cushion for compensation to go higher, for input costs to go higher, and for profit margin s to shrink, and therefor e we wouldn’t get any pass-through into price increases.  Those markups have remained incredibly high—I mean, profit 13 of 158            factor going forward when we’re looking at our fo recasts, given what we’ve seen in unit labor costs, which you mentioned, and other changes in the forecast. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  So, they revised down. The implication of the NIPA revision is that, according to the latest estimates, those markups are a little lower than they were before.  They are still noticeably above their hi storical averages.  In the judgmental forecast, we have never placed an enormous amount of weight on those markup measures, and perhaps the chain of events during this intermeeting period illustra tes why.  Our FRB/US model does put a lot of weight on those markups, and it revised up its inflation projection 0.6 percentage point, something like that.  Now it’s within spitt ing distance of the judgmental forecast. First of all, we have had a hard time gett ing those markups to enter reliably or robustly into an econometric equation.  Second, we’ve been leery of the kind of re visions that took place in this year’s NIPA revision. We’ve certainly re garded them with some nervousness and refer to them as presenting a downside risk to inflation, if those profit margins should compress.  But I’m not entirely sure how to respond to your quest ion as to whether we should put less weight on them since we haven’t put an enormous amount of weight on them in our judgmental projection to date. They are a secondary determinant of our inflation outlook in th e judgmental projection.  As I say, to the extent that you were prepared to put some weight on them before and to see them as high before, you would still see them as high now, though less so. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  And the unit la bor cost trend hasn’t caused you to change your outlook for the future either? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Again, the statis tical analysis is very frustrating.  It’s hard to get that variable to enter reliably, particularly with re al-time data that are susceptible to the kind of revisions that we have seen.  We do put a nod in  our inflation forecast to the acceleration in 14 of 158         structural productivity, which is re lated to unit labor costs, but un it labor costs themselves have likewise not played a prominent ro le in our judgmental forecast. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Yellen. 

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN. Thank you. I have a question for David and Karen, and it picks up on President Poole’s. My question has to do with what, if anything, we can learn about the role of energy-price increases as a factor raising core inflation here from th e experience of other countries. Since we’re not the only country  experiencing increases in energy and other commodity prices, my question is whether or not  there is some econometric or other evidence that pertains to the degree of energy-price pa ss-through into core inflation in other developed economies.  I’m thinking particularly of ec onomies in which inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored—for example, the Unite d Kingdom, Canada, and the euro area.  What do we know about energy-price pass-through into core inflation?  Is there evidence of that? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  I suspect that there is, but I c onfess that I’m not really able to give you the details this morning.  We have not attempted to do a major project of that sort.  There are two things that have to be immediately taken into  account if you’re thinking about some kind of cross-country, or at least non-U.S ., look at this.  First are the ta x features.  Many of the other industrial countries have specific taxes, much higher specific taxes, on fuel products of one sort or another, particularly on gasoline but also on other things.  Those economies will experience a much smaller percentage change in the wholesale and retail pri ces for any given change in the crude oil price than we will.  The shock is alwa ys damped by that on the upside but also on the downside, of course. So that’s a factor that  we point to often, and that is why ocular regression kinds of pass-through would make you thi nk that pass-through is less abroad. 15 of 158           Second is the exchange rate effect. If the dollar is trending down a bit, for a short time anyway, it needs to be taken care of in the dynamics of  the equation rather than in the structure of the equation because we believe that the dolla r oil price adjusts to global demand and supply.  But for short episodes in particular, if one thought the dollar was experiencing a spike or a this or a that, then obviously the changes in  the exchange value of the dollar look to other countries as a piece of how much oil prices have gone up for them.  In general, many countries—say, Japan and, for that matter, even Europe—have a sense that overall the effect is less because their energy intensity is less. They are constantly lecturing us that we c onsume too much energy.  Whether, ceteris paribus, the actual parameter in terms of the price shock really differs I can’t tell you, but the specific taxes and the consequent reduc tion in energy intensity that they have helped to produce, and other factors th at have made them less energy -intensive, do make the problem seem to be smaller in most of the other industrial countries.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. David, in your opening comments you said that the staff got the last two employment numbers right.  But they were below the market expectations of what the employment numbers would be.  In the Greenbook baseline proj ections, the employment growth numbers going forward are even lower.  They ar e 80,000 per month for the re st of this year and 40,000 per month in 2007. Those seem like very low numbers; I think that, if those numbers are realized, they’re going to continue  to surprise markets and to a ppear pretty weak.   So I was wondering how sensitive to those specific employment numbers the outlook is.  I know that the Greenbook has a lower NAIRU alternative simulation;  is that supposed to be providing us with some information about the uncertainty in that fo recast?  Given that lowe r NAIRU alternative in 16 of 158         the Greenbook, I am also curious about what ki nds of employment numbers we are looking at that would achieve those outcomes. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  The predominant factor in generating those strikingly low employment gains is our projection for tre nd labor force participation over the projection period.  With the aging of the workforce, we think that the tr end is now turning decidedly downward, not for cyclical reasons, not because the labor market pr esents atypically unappe aling job opportunities, but because an increasing share of the population is shifting into age groups that have historically exhibited lower labor force partic ipation rates.  My recollection is that the difference between a flat participation rate and a declining participation rate—and I’ ll look it up here if I can find it fast enough for you—is on the order of about 40,000 j obs per month.  We have a neutral private payroll gain for the remainder of this year in the neighborhood of about 90,000 jobs.  If the participation rate were to remain flat, 20,000 to 25,000 jobs would be added to our trend estimate.  We think that the decline in labor force participation is taking about 0.3 percentage point off the growth of hours over the projection period.  Now, if th at were to flatten out, if we simply have the trend wrong, then that would play through the macro forecast—I’m going to do something dangerous here and think out loud—a lot like the adjustment to potential GDP that we just made following the NIPA revision.  In essen ce, a flat participation rate would mean that trend hours growth is that much faster and th at trend aggregate demand 0.3 percentage point faster could be sustaine d without generating additi onal inflation pressures. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN. I have a follow-on question to Sandy’s.  I know how the benchmark GDP revisions work into your forecast. But if yo u look just at the headline numbers, we seem to 17 of 158             have the worst of all circumstances for a central  bank:  a good deal slower growth for a number of reasons—the benchmark being one of them —even though all the output gaps and everything else remain relatively the same, slower head line growth in both GDP  and consumption, and higher inflation. This is not an easy set of circumstances by any means.  One thing I am concerned about, like Sandy, is th e speed with which you have consumers reacting in their consumption to potential GDP changes.  You have n’t changed the saving rate that much from your earlier forecast, but you do get the 0.3 percenta ge point out of GDP growth.  I was just wondering about your thoughts on th at—the reaction seemed fast.  Second, outside of a recession, have we ever seen this kind of decline in  real estate investment in a period of growth? We were trying to find it, but it’s hard to sort through cause and effect here.  The decline seemed very large in terms of the negative real estate  investment.  Finally, Ka ren mentioned that we haven’t seen wage inflation or wage growth outstrip productivity here or in major countries anywhere else in the world. I’m wondering, given all the focus on the fact that median family incomes are not growing on a real basis, whether there is at least some chance that we’re going to start seeing an increasing return, particul arly for skilled people, which everybody tells you they can’t find. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Let me take those concerns in  turn.  First, with regard to the speed of adjustment of consumption to potential GDP—perhaps it is ironic, but our assumption is that we are the most ignorant ones in this little moralit y play; that households and businesses have been aware of the slower growth of potential GDP; and that, as  far as households and businesses are concerned, what goes on in the basement of the BEA is utterly without conseque nce.  You can see that as well, for example, in our leaving the stock market proj ection unrevised.  Implic it in the way we have reacted to the news from the BEA is that households an d businesses knew of the slower trajectory.  18 of 158                      Investors knew of the slower traj ectory for potential GDP.  It was we who were off in previously assuming an erroneously steep upw ard trend for potential GDP.  It does change the error pattern: The pattern of errors over history is changed a bit, and at the margin, that sends us into the projection period with slightly different dynamics; but those are very small effects.  (Sandy is alerting me that an important pi ece of news that we  received was the weakness of disposable income growth in the second quarter.) 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  But you still have it growing pretty fast  over the forecast period— 4 percent or so. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Yes; indeed, fa ster than spending, and that’s  how we generate the upward motion of the personal saving rate. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  The way that chan ges is sort of speedy, too; bu t that was in your previous forecast. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Now, let’s se e.  I can’t read my own notes.  The second question is? 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Just a real estate investment question. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Oh, have we seen anything like  this outside of a re cession?  I don’t know the answer to that.  I would ment ion, however, how stro ng residential investment was through the recession and how well sustained it  was and how we all remarked on  the strength with which that sector persisted through that period  of very low interest rates.  Ev ery business cycle is different from every other one, but this one certa inly has its unique f eature, which is the uncharacteristic strength of residential investment thro ugh the recession period, and we have that coming off now. Third, you asked about growth  in real compensation or r eal wages.  We have some acceleration in our projection.  We  expect it to occur.  We expe ct it to be cons istent with a moderating profile of price inflation.   We do see labor’s share of in come as lower no w than it will 19 of 158                   be in some equilibrium point in the future, so we expe ct that aspect of national income to shift in its composition.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Just a quick qu estion for Karen.  Ka ren, looking at the global economy as a whole, would you say that capacity utilization has increased since we last met, since the end of the last quarter, or since the beginning of the year and, if so, to a significant degree? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. I would say in a kind of notional sense that most especially China, for example, has not slowed to the de gree that we and everybody else had been expecting.  There was a significant positive surprise in the Q2 numbers fo r China.  At the time we saw what we called the “volatility” of May-J une, when it looked as th ough some commodity pric es were coming off and the stories that they had been held up by speculato rs and so forth seemed true, and it looked as though those prices might actually adjust downward and stay down.  Well, that perception was very short lived:  The fundamental demand for some of these products seems to have reasserted itself, and many of those prices are back up where they once were.  So based on those kinds of indirect signals, I would say that the strength of the global economy is at least what it was three months ago and perhaps a tiny bit stronger. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Is that net of our weakness or our declining? This is just guess work, but I am curious. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. If the full traj ectory going through the rest of  this year that is in the Greenbook takes place, then the United  States is going to take the world back ju st a bit, and it will bring Canada with it probably.  At least that is what our forecast says will happ en.  We see China 20 of 158            stepping harder on the mechanisms that it uses to try to slow its ec onomy.  In some sense, I would say that the Greenbook pict ure we’re painting is  that global capacity utili zation is perhaps at a peak right about now and that we anticipate the slowing in the United States and the efforts in China certainly to outweigh the continued strength, say, in Europe or Japan, which is probably going to happen.  Still in all, that may be the mean of our forecast, but there’s a distribution around that, and it’s certainly possible that there are upside risk s as well as downside risks in those capacity pressures. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any other questions? 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  May I just briefly mention the st aff view?  Our research on structural labor force participation is laid out in a Brookings paper that is just abou t due for release by folks who are our labor specialists.  That paper sets out in  considerable detail our work in this area. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. We  are ready for our economic outlook go-round. For President Plosser’s benefit, I will say that we have two go-rounds.  The first is on the economic outlook, and the second is on policy issues.  One hand means you want to be recognized, and Michelle will put your name on the lis t.  If you want to interject a question or a comment, we have two-handed interventions. Who would like to go first? President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in the Seventh District moderated in the second quarter in line with our expectat ions after a very strong first quarter. Most of my directors and business contacts believe that  added caution is taking hold in the economy.  Some think that growth will be noticeably slower in the second half of the year, and some believe that slowing will continue in to 2007.  However, my contacts are unable to point to explicit examples, apart from housi ng, showing that such a marked deceleration 21 of 158           currently is in train. Indeed, ma ny of the reports that we get are quite upbeat.  For instance, one of our national temporary help contacts said hi s indicators were pointi ng to a bounceback from a weak second quarter, and he wa s seeing strong conversions from temporary to permanent status. One reason that some people were more pess imistic was that they believe the current expansion is a bit, as they say, long in the toot h, and so the economy must be due for a period of weakness. Of course, the economic literature finds  that the probability of an expansion’s ending does not depend on the expansion’s current length.  However, these comments could reflect imbalances in the economy that increase exposure to adverse shocks.  But except for housing, any references to such imbalances are vague at best.  Although it is not certain, the mixture of reports may simply be indicative of the normal process of the economy’s moderating to growth averaging near or a bit below potential.  On the inflation front, we continue to hear reports of cost pass-through and other price increases similar to those we’v e received in recent months. Turning to the national outlook, although grow th moderated in the second quarter, GDP growth for the first half was a solid 4 percent.  The unemployment rate remains below 5 percent, and the core PCE inflation rate has now been at or  above 2 percent for more than two years.  It has to be said, in looking simply at the top-line data that form the basis of most Taylor rules, that real activity is pretty good and inflation is too high.  In this context, three related questions guided my thinking on the outlook.  First, are th ere important imbalances within particular sectors that should concern us?  Second, is the list of exogenous downside shocks accumulating to a point that the risks to gr owth outweigh those from deterior ating inflation?  Third, are the current financial conditi ons restrictive or not? Regarding sectoral imbalances, for some time we have assumed a marked slowdown in residential investment, but other sectors do not seem to be outside normal ranges of variation 22 of 158        associated with an economy that is growing clos e to potential.  Business fixed investment last quarter was weaker than we had thought, but the weakness appeared to largely reflect transitory developments in volatile categories—comm unication equipment and transportation.  Importantly, we don’t hear any stories of pulling back due to earlier overinvestment.  On the household side, the steady growth in the consump tion of nondurables and serv ices indicates that households do not seem to be overly concerned about their longer-term prospects for income growth. So for now, I do not see any sectoral  imbalances that would pile on the housing adjustment and cause a more fundamental downshift in economic growth over the forecast period. What about shocks?  Well, the list of dow nside shocks is troublesome.  Energy prices continue to surprise us on the upside. Geopolitic al risks have increased, particularly considering developments in the Middle East.  We now have some sense from businesses that animal spirits may be making them more cautious.  Currently, howeve r, I think that this is more rhetoric than action. Still I think that  all these factors dese rve careful monitoring. Third, what about financial conditions?  When  I was preparing for this meeting, I talked to no one who thought that conditions are restrictive.  The modal response continues to be that financing is readily available a nd is fueling a lot of dealmaki ng.  Ten-year Treasury rates are under 5 percent. Risk spreads are low. If we want to assess the constraining effects of past increases in the federal funds rate, we need to take into account the level of interest rates.  In all likelihood, the real funds rate has only recently reached neutral.  Furthermore, we need to consider the accommodation that we had put in place in 2003 and 2004.  The core PCE inflation data we now have for that period are about ½ pe rcentage point higher than  what we saw in the real-time initially announced inflat ion rates that guided our policy decisions back then.  So the 23 of 158        unwelcome disinflation of 2003 was not  as severe as we had feared  at the time, and accordingly, our policy was more accommodative than we th ought at the time, which may have had inflationary consequences. The incoming data ma ke the current inflation situation seem much more troublesome.  First, as we all know, the latest  reading on core PCE inflation is 2.4 percent.  That’s pretty high. Second, the revised NIPA data indicate that core PCE inflation has been at or above 2 percent since April 2004, as  President Poole mentioned.  The combination of these two facts makes me more concerned th at inflation expectations may s oon begin to drift up.  Finally, I don’t see the forces in play that would make the policy assumption in the Greenbook restrictive enough to put core inflation on a downward traj ectory over the next 18 months.  If the pass-through was small on the way up, it seems likely to be small on the way down, and output gaps that might be emerging will not alter inflation’s traj ectories very much or very quickly with flat estimates of Phillips curves. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Yellen. 

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  So far the economy has stuck pretty close to the script of the soft landing sketched out in the June Green book.  Real GDP growth slowed have decelerated; this situa tion suggests that our policy ac tions have taken hold in this interest-sensitive sector.  The recent sharp rise in  oil prices should also put a damper on growth of real income and consumer spending.  Most fo recasters now expect below-trend growth in the current quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment has shifted down to a more-sustainable pace, and the unemployment rate has risen to 4.8 percent,  just a bit below standard estimates of the NAIRU. Core inflation, although uncomfortably high, came in 0.2 percentage point below the 24 of 158       the price of oil, inflation expectations held fi rm.  In light of these developments, a reasonable forecast is for growth to continue to run sligh tly below its potential rate, the unemployment rate to edge up, and core infla tion to recede gradually.   At our last meeting, I laid out some of my  concerns about downside risks to the outlook for growth and upside risks to inflation. Quite honestly, I cannot say that  the recent data have done much to assuage my angst on either account.  The recent falloff in housing activity and the residential investment falling at  an annual rate of 14 percent in  the second half of this year, nearly twice as fast as projected in June. These surprises intensify the risk of a sharper slowdown as the lagged effects of our past policy actions come fully into effect.  For example, the housing slowdown could become an unwelcome housing slump as envisioned in one of the Greenbook alternative scenarios. A large homebuild er in our District su mmarized the views of many of our contacts when he recently comment ed that “the housing market has not yet popped, but a hissing sound is now clearly audible.” [Laughter] He point ed to rapidly rising cancellations as a particularly ominous sign.  I will be watching the inco ming data closely for signs as to whether the housing slowdown remains orderly as hope d or takes a steeper downward slide, posing a greater risk to the economy. My concerns about inflation have also been  somewhat heightened by the recent data or, more precisely, revisions to past data. Core measures of inflation continue to be well above my comfort zone. Of course, after the experience of last year, when  core inflation was revised up by a considerable amount, I approached this year’s  annual NIPA revision with some considerable trepidation. I was relieved to see that the core PCE price inflati on data came out of the revision relatively unscathed, revised up just  0.1 percentage point for 2005; but other aspects of the report 25 of 158       were somewhat less reassuring fo r the inflation outlook.  First, the rate of labor productivity growth over the past three years has been a bi t slower than we thought, primarily because of downward revisions to the rate of capital accu mulation, so that the Greenbook now projects structural productivity growth of 2.7 percent, about ¼ percentage point slower than we thought back in June. This revision suggests somewhat  less downward pressure on inflation emanating from cost reductions and, therefore, greater upside risks to inflation.   But that wasn’t the only surprise tucked  away in the annual revision.  The upward revision to compensation growth over the past f our quarters implies that growth in unit labor costs over the past year has been  more rapid than we had believe d.  I had thought that there was a good chance that compensation per hour and uni t labor costs would increase relatively moderately going forward, helping to  contain inflationary pressures.  The data revision was thus a bit of a wake-up call for me, and I have revised upward my views on the outlook for compensation and unit labor costs.  My reading of  the report is that the revised data provide a clearer and less sanguine picture of the trend in this measure of compensation.  However, the employment cost index was in lin e with expectations in June a nd continues to show moderate growth. Moreover, even with revisions to productivity and compensation, the markup in the nonfarm business sector remains very high by histor ical standards, sugges ting that firms do have room to absorb costs. Overall, I view the inflation outlook as hi ghly uncertain, with a pronounced upside risk.  As I mentioned at the last meeting, we just don’t have a good handle on why core inflation has risen of late or how persistent this rise will be.  While it is comforting to attribute the increase to energy and commodity-price pass-through, empirical evidence suggests that  pass-through effects 26 of 158        have been quite modest since the mid-1980s.  If so, the door is open for other explanations that Something that makes me even more uncertain about the inflation outlo ok is that standard backward-looking Phillips curve models of inflat ion appear to be breaking down.  It has been widely noted that the estimated effect of resour ce utilization on inflation in such models has become much smaller over time.  But equally stri king is the finding that the sum of coefficients on lagged inflation when freely estim ated appears to have fallen as  well, suggesting that inflation has become far less persistent.  In fact, our staff finds that, in looki ng over the past ten years, it is better to assume that core inflation will return to its sample average over the next four quarters than that it will remain in its recent range or follow a standard Phillips curve model.  Interestingly, this decline in th e persistence of core inflation has occurred at roughly the same time that long-run inflation expectations, as meas ured by the Survey of Professional Forecasters, appear to have become well anchored, and this  may not be a coincidence.  Economic models with forward-looking inflation expe ctations tell us that, if the cen tral bank has credibility and holds to a fixed long-run inflation target, then inflation will be le ss persistent than is implied by the standard backward-looking Phillips curve mo del.  Indeed, the puzzle for macroeconomists has been why we see so much inflation persistence.  Perhaps we no longer do. If that is true, inflation may decline faster  than the Greenbook expects. Admittedly, the past ten years form a relatively small sample from which to draw definitive conclusions.  But the inflation proce ss may have changed in a fundamental way, and we should be open to that possibility. I would like to stress that this evidence and the analysis concern the simple correlations of  the inflation data that are used for forecasting.  The evidence does not relate to structural relationships, and therefore it does not necessa rily inform us about 27 of 158          how our policy decisions affect the economy or a bout the best course for policy.  In summary, although my modal forecast is relatively benign, I remain very concerned about risks to both growth and inflation.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, at our last FOMC meeting in my now over one-year-long attempt to stay away from any analogies referring  to innings or baseball [laughter], I used the analogy of Phil Mickelson at the U.S. Open to s uggest an opposite strategy.  What I suggested was that we use the minutes we are about to re lease and especially your testimony, if you recall, to center the ball on the fairway so that we coul d approach the green from the point of this meeting.  It appears now that we have done th at, you have done that, a nd the minutes have done that, and we are basically at a point where we are confident of either a hawkish pause or one more tightening of the screw in term s of raising the federal funds rate. The Greenbook and the Bluebook do a good job of  presenting us with an analytical framework for this meeting.  I want to compliment  them, with an “i,” but I also thought it might be helpful to complement them, with an “e,” with  some of the data and inputs from our business contacts and the work of our own research sta ff on the issues we have been talking about.  Let me start with housing.  I re gularly talk to CEOs of two of  the five big builders.  They like using analogies. In the words of the second larg est builder in the country, “The pig is still in the python.” That is, he expects the decline from peak to trough in home sales to exceed that forecast in the Greenbook.  I think we had 17½ pe rcent; he is talking about a correction of 25 percent. To adhere to the convention of reporting on my Distri ct, which we are supposed to do, I’m happy to say that only Texas, where our economy is on the verge of employing ten million workers, is holding up in the books of these two homebuilders.  Even the Carolinas are 28 of 158       starting to fold over, and the weakest area is California.  Th e Big Five builders and other homebuilders are reacting as you mi ght expect.  They are cutting staff.  They are renegotiating their prices and getting concessions from their subcontractors.  Th ey are walking away from their planned land deals, and they are renegotiating existing contracts.  This is what a macroeconomist would expect in reaction.  In answer to Cat hy’s and David’s questions, one CEO, who has been in the business since 1973, reports  that this correction is the roughest and most sudden he has seen, with one exception. That exception is that  the industry is signifi cantly consolidated, with most of the big builders either supporting very strong balance sheets or having ready accessibility to capital from a flush banking system and eager private equity groups.  So the reports I received from the Big Five are that, while they are wringing th eir hands, they’re also licking their chops; they are plotting acquisitions of  smaller, weaker builders when they reach the depths of despair. This situation may signa l the prospect of a s horter turnaround time for a correction, or it may not, but I just throw it out for your  contemplation. Clearly, however, the housing downturn and the cumulative effect of energy and electricity price increases are having an effect.  One of my contacts is th e CEO of a large “casual dining” restaurant chain, which employs 110,000 out of the 4.8 million people employed in that segment of the restaurant business.  He reports  that his utility costs this year have risen 30 percent and his materials costs have rise n 15 percent.  Although customers are moving downscale in terms of the dining chain, guest counts  for that segment of the market, which again employs 4.8 million people, are down 5 percent in the last week, and he sees that trend continuing. The CEO of a national middle price point reta iler reported that furniture sales in July were down 21 percent. A low-e nd price point retailer—the low-e nd price point being Wal-Mart 29 of 158       to 7-Eleven—reports slowing traffic. In the wo rds of the head of Wal-Mart USA, John Menzer, “What we saw last month is getting worse.”  So-called morning madness sales, which are common in September, have been moved up to July and August. The railroads report a significant slowdown over the past four weeks in the shipment of forest products. So we do have a slowdown, although it is important to point out that the rails, according to the companies themselves, expect to  increase traffic 3 percent during the second half because of industrial demand.  UPS reports  through its CFO that it is shipping 13.2 million packages a day, which is down from about 13.5 in the first half but up from 12.7 in ’05.  Incidentally, their report last quarter proved to be  remarkably accurate in terms of their expected growth for the second quarter, if it, in turn, is revised upward toward 3 percent.  So I want to stick with what I reported at the June FO MC meeting—that our “roadster” economy has downshifted in growth. I also reported a sense that  inflation pressure gauge needles were moving forward, and my soundings this time indicate that  they continue to do so.  I t hought that the briefing the staff gave to the Board and circulated to us was ve ry helpful, and I appreciate very much the discussion we had earlier on inflation in answer to President Poole’s question.  It is important to point out that the monthly trimmed mean PCE in flation rate in June was 3.1 percent.  On a twelve-month basis, it picked up to 2.7 percent.   But very importantly—if, as President Poole suggested, you break down the PCE components, whether you trim it or y ou use it “fully garbed” [laughter]—83 percent of the components are increas ing in price.  That is  up from 73 percent in 30 of 158           We know that inflationary pr essures are building abroad.  Karen, our work in Dallas is very much in its infancy; but to the extent th at it helps, our measurement of industrial capacity utilization in all th e large member states of the European Union is up.  Recent revisions to the United Kingdom’s national accounts indicate that the Brits ar e operating closer to capacity; and if you look at the Tankan survey, for the first tim e in more than a decade, Japan is reporting capacity constraints. Like everybody else, we have no reliable data on China and India, but we know that their economies are steaming along.  As  they grow, they cut into existing global capacity available to U.S. businesses.  Let me give you an example.  Our shipping CEOs report that a portion of the in ternational fleet of large bulk carri ers, although they estimate that this portion is only about 2 percent, has now been rerouted and is being used for intracoastal, intra-Chinese trade.  So at a time of the y ear when usually the rates cave for these Panamax ships, which are the largest bulk carriers, the daily rate has sti ffened another $1,000.  It is up to $23,000 from the $22,000 that I reported at our last meeting, even t hough this is usually the soft time of the year.  Just for a reference point, last  year at this time it was one-half that price. At home our bankers report, in the words of  the CEO of the largest bank in Texas, “more talk about price increases and pa ss-throughs.”  We are seeing the re turn in our District of the term “air ball financing,” which is financi ng based on prospects not on hard reality.  One example that caught my interest, which is yet unre ported in the public press, is that, according to the CEO of a large corp oration with a $30 billion market capitalization, they have been approached by a single buyout group to take them private.  So th ere is a lot of liqui dity left in the system. The CEO of Wal-Mart USA reports that they are building in a price increase of 1 percent this year. It is the first incr ease in a long, long time.  Typically they built in minus 1 percent to 31 of 158         minus 2 percent.  The increase was confirmed by the CEO of one of Wal-Ma rt’s largest suppliers of nongrocery goods, who quoted Lee Scott as telling him last week, “We are reaching the limits of productivity enhancement and may have to take it out in price increases.”  Kimberly-Clark’s CEO reports that he started the year  planning for an inflat ion factor in their co st of goods sold of $150 million.  It has been ratcheted up in two intervals and is now at $350 million.  He reports that they are covering increases in the cost of goods sold through price increases.  This is in sharp contrast to what he has been te lling me before every previous meeting. Food processors report the same.  It might  be noteworthy that corn prices—even though we don’t include them in the core PCE—are, because of ethanol production, up significantly.  That’s very unusual at this time of the year.  Fr ito-Lay’s CEO reports an overall inflation shift— in his own words, “the ability to pass thr ough price increases and make them stick.”  Finally, Mr. Chairman, at a recent meeting you asked about my reports from Hewitt, the consulting company, regarding the prospects for h ealth care costs.  Acco rding to one of my sources, several of the largest in surers are focusing on a settleme nt range of roughly 7 percent to 8½ percent growth for next year. It  is a little more than they ha d expected; it is roughly what it was last year. I might point  out that those companies cover a large number of people. To supplement this input, I touched base w ith three people I cons ider to be the best long-term practitioners in the fund-management bus iness.  Each one has been in the business for more than thirty years.  Besides reporting continued high appetites for risk and continued elevated liquidity in the marketplace, these gnarly old-timers repor t a shift in the attitude of businesses that they cover in investing. To quote one, “Before, the operators we deal with were worried about getting their heads handed to them  if they tried to pa ss through price increases; now they’re trying to see what they can get aw ay with.”  In summary, the CEO of Cadbury 32 of 158          Schweppes—to kill the serpentine analogy—says that “we’re just not through the snake yet on inflation.”  Mr. Chairman, this is a long and faithful repor t.  For all the inherent risks, I pay close attention to what I hear from my CEO contacts.  According to them , in addition to the data that we are seeing, the economy is slowing from its torrid pace of growth and downshifting to a more normal range.  Global capacity and utilization are not slowing apace from what we can see, or if they are slowing, overall global capac ity utilization is staying at an even level.  It is also clear that the business community has its finger poised on the trigger of price increases.  It may well be that the lagged effect of our  de-accommodation has yet to temper the price equation.  It may be that energy prices and other co st-push factors are at a point of tapering off.  It may be that moderation in the domestic economy’s growth ra te will remove demand-pull potential, and it producers here, although it could have a counter-effect  in terms of the exchange rate effect on the costs of imports.  But I do want to ask us to re member that inflation is—a s stated in a paper that was circulated previously—an inertial process.  (The paper may have been from you, Bill.)  We must be very careful in word and in deed that we do not encourage impulse s that will spur that inertia and that will prove harder and more costly to rein in further down the road.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  Incoming data on the national economy have been slightly lower on the growth  side and slightly higher on the side of continuing price escalation than at least we expect ed, and we have seen re flections of both these trends in the New England economy.  Overall, ho wever, my sense is that growth for the region and the nation remains relatively solid but  that price pressures are a concern. 33 of 158        The region’s economy appears to continue to grow at a pace that will be sufficient to keep local unemployment levels in the fours.  The region has a slower pace of job growth than the nation, but total personal income is growing at  about the same pace.  This suggests that per capita income growth is relatively solid, which is reflected in rising retail  sales and state income tax collection. Indeed, local bus inesses continually comment on their inability to find skilled labor so that at least some of the region’s slow job growth may be  attributable to supply rather than demand conditions. New England’s residential housing correcti on is becoming more evident and, by some measures, may be more significant than that for the nation as a whole.  Home sales were 4 percent to 5 percent of f their 2005 highs in the first quarter.  That is similar to the nation, but the Case-Shiller-Weiss repeat-sales index sees, at least for Q1, the nation’s home-price escalation at about 10 percent year over year but Boston ar ea prices up much less than that.  More-recent data from other surveys suggest that regional pr ices may be falling.  Inventories of homes for sale continue to grow, and the value of regional residential construction c ontracts fell more than 20 percent, compared with about 4½ percent for the nation.  Th is number likely reflects the relatively small amount of residential cons truction in the region, but the downturn is eye-catching anyway. Despite this, consumer  confidence rebounded a bit from earlier this summer, and business contacts repo rt relatively good performance. Now, one thread in my recent conversations  with businesses is not dissimilar to what President Fisher just talked about. I found it a bit troubling that ma nufacturing and related business services appear to believe that they ha ve greater pricing power than before.  They are talking less about increasing competition and less about efforts to increase productivity.  They seem to be less worried about margin squeezes and more confident that rising input costs, 34 of 158            particularly those related to energy, can be passed on.  Some ev en report that strong demand has enabled them to raise prices or to avoid discounting even without major new input cost pressures.  In general, there was a disquieting tone  of greater tolera nce for inflation. On the national scene, re cent data on second-quarter growth, employment, and housing of us have been forecasting a gradual slowdown to  potential or slightly below over ’06 and ’07 as the economy makes a transition from consumer-l ed to business-led growth and the saving rate climbs to a positive number. But has the evolving slowdown turned out to be a bigger soft patch than expected, or are we simply suffering through the ups and downs of the transition process?  I am not sure of the answer to that question.  I found the relatively low GDP and consumption figures for late ’06 and ’07 in the Greenbook for ecast a bit disquieting, ev en after recognizing the effect of the benchmark re visions on potential GDP. Our forecast in Boston had been in sync with the Greenbook’s and on the low side of the range of forecasts around this table, but now we  see growth of 0.6 to 0.7 percentage point above the Greenbook in ’07. We’re not projecting as large a hit to re sidential investment over the period, and we see solid disposable income offsetting high energy costs and lower housing wealth to a greater degree than does the Greenb ook.  Moreover, although slow job growth is a concern, at full employment or beyond how much  of this is a supply rather than a demand phenomenon, particularly when you take into  account lower labor force participation? Are firms hesitant to hire because they are f earful of the future or because they can’t find the skills they need?  They cer tainly are not constrained by a la ck of resources.  Thus, I am inclined to the view that, although things seem slower than  we expected and the Greenbook forecast seems softer, not much has really change d since our last meeting.  Consumer spending 35 of 158         has been relatively well maintained despite a weakness in Q2.  Spending for equipment and software appears to be in good shape.  And net exports, given growth abroad, will be positive at least for a time.  Residential i nvestment is waning, but how fast is hard to say, and there well could be an offset to that from nonresiden tial investment.  Financial markets remain accommodative, and given the rise in  inflation, real rates are down. What is a bit different is the fact that inflation is growing at  a faster pace in the short run and is growing across most aspects of the core m easure.  Certainly it is faster and broader based than I would like, and we continue to see le veling-off or falling price numbers only in the forecast. I recognize that will continue to be  the case for some time even in the best of circumstances, but I am concerned that we may not face the best of circumstances.  Geopolitical events of all sorts and global demand continue to put pressure on inpu t prices.  Productivity growth is likely slower, and economic activ ity may not wane enough to reduce resource pressures. As time goes by and outsized inflation growth continues, one can imagine a sense of inflation complacency growing.  In that regard, as I noted earlier, I found the regional anecdotes about making price increases stick of some concern. I should note here that my own board of dire ctors in a telephone m eeting just yesterday indicated concern about the ongoing strength of the economy and voted to maintain  the current primary credit rate.  I myself worry about overdoi ng the tightening process, but as I told them, I don’t think we’re at risk of that at present.  Given the pace of inflation and given financial conditions more accommodative than before our last in crease.  In sum, I continue to be a bit less worried about variations in the cycle and more  worried about the medium-term prospects for inflation. 36 of 158

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Guynn.

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In ou r last meeting I reported that, while our Southeast economy still seemed reasonably solid, we were beginning to pick up anecdotal signs that activity might be slowing.  Well, that sluggishness is now gradually showing up in the data as well. The slowing is perhaps most noticeabl e in our labor markets.  Although we are still hearing that businesses in some sectors are havi ng problems finding workers, especially in areas such as construction, accounting, and housekeeping, payroll employment figures for June in our states were disappointing. They showed seasonally adjusted contraction with absolute declines reported in Georgia, Tennessee, an d Mississippi and less-than-expect ed job growth in Florida.  Employers seem to be trying their best to hold th e line on staffing, given the sense that they have of a slowing in the pace of grow th and an uncertain outlook.   Manufacturing activity in our region is mixed.  Consumer spending remains softer than earlier in the year, and the tour ism outlook is reported to be gu ardedly optimistic.  The bright spot in some ways is the Gulf Coast outside New Orleans, where the demand for most construction materials and labor and for replacem ent household and personal goods is strong; but that pocket of elevated spending is not enough to  offset the sluggishness elsewhere.  The big semiannual apparel and gift mart show in Atlant a, where buyers just came to place their major orders for expected year-end holiday sa les, was reported to have been slow. The regional bankers are reporti ng slowing in loan demand, part icularly in the consumer housing sectors. However, the experience in C&I lending is more mixed.  At the same time, credit quality, in the words of two bankers w ith whom we talked, was “unsustainably” or “embarrassingly” good.  Banks are also pulling back  on their lending into the softening housing 37 of 158          District. Home sales have slowed, and there now have been sharp corrections in some markets, especially coastal Florida. Perhaps the most-talked-about new worry in  our region, and something I mentioned for the first time at our last meeting, is the growi ng problem of obtaining a ffordable wind, flood, and related insurance in our coas tal areas, resulting from the huge  losses incurred by insurance companies from hurricanes in recent years.  Some  carriers have quit offering coverage at any price, and costs of policies that are available have increased at extraordinary rates.  That problem is affecting residential construc tion and sales and causing some businesses to pull up stakes and move elsewhere. Together, the various developm ents that I have just ticked off have taken considerable momentum out of the strong economic growth and outlook we were seeing in our region earlier in the year. Our sense of what’s happening at the nati onal level is much the same.  It now seems reasonably clear that we have settled into a pattern of slow er and probably subpar growth.  We saw evidence of that in the second-quarter GDP  data and in the markedly slower employment gains in recent months.  The se veral models that our Atlanta st aff now employs to forecast real growth are suggesting somewhat slower growth in the 2½ percent to 3 percent range as being most likely over the second half of this year and through 2007.  Getting a good handle on the inflation outlook is  a bit harder.  Our most recent Atlanta modeling work produces a somewhat encouraging inflation path over the next 18 months, which suggests that core inflation shoul d stop its upward drift and gradually begin to move back toward 2 percent. That optimistic outlook is consistent  with the most likely path laid out in the Greenbook and with the central tendency of th e forecasts we all submitted for the recent congressional testimony.  At the same time, ev en those optimistic forecasts do not seem to 38 of 158          indicate that core inflation is likely to move co mfortably to within the ranges many of us have indicated we would like eventually to see. Of course, these encouraging longer-term or medium-term, as some have been calling it, outlooks are very much at odds with the disc ouraging headline numbers and the increasingly higher core inflation readings in recent months.  There seems to be good reason to expect that some of the coming near-term inflation data could well be disappointing before we begin to see the expected improvement, and these current data he lp to shape inflation e xpectations.  In one of our recent briefings, an economist humbly observed that, despite all the work that has been done and continues to be done in the profession, our models for forecasting inflation are still less than stellar as judged by past experience. So we go into the policy discussion with some encouraging inflation forecasts but having to acknowledge wide error bands and considerable uncertainty around those forecasts. I look forward, I think, to an interesting but probably difficult policy discussion. [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My outlook hasn’t changed very much since last spring, when I was c ontemplating the not-so-welcome cycle of slowdown in economic activity and some persistence in both headline an d core inflation due to the lingering effects of large energy-price increases.  In fact, the Greenbook projections for real GDP now reflect something close to the pessimistic end of wh ere I thought things could be heading.  The difference is that I have been thinking more of a cyclical slowdown and not so much of a slowdown in demand and supply, as reflected in the Greenbook baseline.  The possibility that slack might not be widening as economic growth  moves down puts the re cent inflation numbers in a particularly bad light. 39 of 158           I have been especially concerned about how  broadly based the inflationary pressures appear to be. When you take energy components out of the CPI and you look at the median that Richard was referring to earlier, about 67 percent of the expend iture-weighted items in the CPI increased at an annual rate of 3 percent or more in June, which is about the same share that we have seen since March. As Richard mentione d, the PCE statistics yield basically the same results. In Procter & Gamble’s most recent earni ngs report, the company attributed its good earnings performance partly to the ability to pa ss on higher costs through to product prices, and I am hearing similar remarks about pricing power from our directors and District business contacts. Although my business contacts have been reporting some ability to pass on price increases now at the retail level, where in the past they were saying that it was very difficult to go beyond intermediate goods, they’re not so sure th at they will get more than one-time catch-up adjustments.  Most of my business contacts have  not expressed concerns about an elevation in the long-term inflation trend. Nevertheless, I think there are clearly reasons to be worried about the risk of inflationary pressures intensifying over the balance of the projection period.  I al so think that there is a risk that we’re not going to see as much slack as is embedded in the Greenbook baseline.  As in many other parts of the country, activity in the housing sector is slowing in  the Midwest, particularly in the Fourth District, and the housing situation in th e Fourth District could never be characterized as bubbly or frothy. Some of the veteran Realtors in my District with whom I have been talking are saying that this housing market is the worst that they can recall.  Comments like these, although they are selected, do suggest some more uncertain prospects for the housing sector.  My directors and business contacts ha ve also been sounding a bit more  cautious about the outlook for 40 of 158         their sales, but at the same time their capital spending plans appear  to be intact.  They remain vocal about the ability to get pr oductivity gains, and they remain  disciplined about their hiring plans. So as I contemplate the weaker sp ending track that’s forecast in the Greenbook, I’m inclined to attribute more of it to the demand side of the economy than to the supply side.  That is, I am expecting the Greenbook’s call for modera tion in economic growth to result in  a little more slack than appears in the Greenbook’s baseline.   In a qualitative sense, my outlook carries lower inflationary pressure than the Greenbook baseline and thus is similar in spirit to the “lower NAIRU” alternative scenario.  Separating the cyclical and structural performa nce of the economy, of course, is  a real challenge, and it is natural, I think, to feel unsure about the real-time estimates and projection of slack.  If the slower growth of potential output in the Greenbook baselin e is accurate, it raises the possibility that the equilibrium real interest rate ma y be lower than it was in the la st half of the 1990s.  In summary, Mr. Chairman, I still think there are risks to both of  our objectives.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker. MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Fifth District’s economy remains generally strong, though overall growth appears to ha ve moderated in recent weeks.  Retail sales have been lackluster, especially for big-ticket  items.  Manufacturing shipments and new orders picked up in July, however, and our early readin gs for August are even stronger in suggesting additional momentum going forward.  District labor markets remain tight, with workers in some skill categories hard to find in  urban areas and temporary wo rkers in demand.  The housing Current and expected price trend measures remain  very elevated, according to our surveys, as they have been for most of the year.   41 of 158         Turning to the national economy, I focused at  our last two meetings on my concerns about the deteriorating outlook for inflation, and the news over the intermeeting period has heightened those concerns. But today I think it is important that  we also assess carefully the outlook for output and employment.  I’m pretty sure that I can safely do so without danger of being viewed as an outpu t nutter.  [Laughter] GDP growth has been choppy in recent quarters;  but over the past ye ar and a half, output has been growing at about 3½ percent. You get the same 3½ percent growth rate if you average over the past three and a half y ears.  We have substantially re duced the overhang of underutilized resources over that period. Employment has gr own about 1½ percent a y ear, and the labor force has grown at just a littl e over 1 percent.  I think the eviden ce is now fairly persuasive that resources are approximately fully utilized in the sense that significant amounts of idle labor or capital do not seem to be awaiti ng the return of better times. What sorts of growth rates for output or em ployment are sustainable over the next two years?  The labor force appears likely to grow at about 1 percent—that is, about 110,000 jobs per month. Labor productivity has b een trending around 2½ percent over the past couple of years, but I would be a bit more conservative going fo rward and expect about 2¼ percent per year, closer to the long-run average.  As a result, it  seems reasonable to put the center point of an estimate of a sustainable real growth rate at about 3¼ percent, with perhaps some extra above that if you’re more optimistic  about productivity growth. Is this trend our best near-term forecast?  Several factors co uld contribute to weaker real growth. Residential investment will contract in the coming quarte rs as the housing market cools, and lower average housing-price appreciation w ill reduce household wealth gains and damp consumption growth.  The upward sweep in energy prices has taken a bite ou t of real disposable 42 of 158          income as well, but I would expect real hous ehold spending to track real household income going forward because both the housing-price adju stment and the energy-price run-up, so far at least, look more like one-time re ductions in household wealth and income and not like sources of ongoing erosion extending out more than a year. So I think it is reasonable to expect consumption to grow at close to 3 percent, dow n a bit from the averag e of 3½ percent over the past several years. Other factors seem likely to bolster growth.  Business fixed investment spending has been expanding quite strongly in this reco very.  It is up at an annual ra te of close to 7 percent since the beginning of 2003, despite the sluggishness of structur es until this year.  In the second quarter, BFI was up 6.8 percent year-over-year, and the most recent high-frequency indicators remain on track. BFI spending as a share of GDP is still quite low by historical standards; and as the Greenbook points out, the fundamentals—busine ss balance sheets and output growth—look quite solid. So it seems reasonable to expect busin ess investment to continue to expand at a rate close to 7 percent. Putting everything together, I expect growth over the next year and a half to be just under 3 percent, or just more than ¼ percentage point below potential.  The Greenbook forecast is weaker—GDP growth at about 2¼ percent for th e next six quarters—mainly because the Board staff sees lower business investment spending and a pronounced reversal in the household saving rate. I think that a healthy respect for the un certainty involved sugg ests that reasonable confidence intervals around each of these forecasts—the Greenbook’s and my own and the others I’ve heard today, for that matter—would in clude all the other poin t estimates and, more important, would include the possibility that gr owth proceeds at potential over the forecast 43 of 158       period and beyond. So though it is reasonable to expect  growth at or less than potential in the near term, my sense is that it’s hard to be too certain that it will be much below for long. As I said at the outset, the inflation pi cture has only worsened.  The surge in core inflation that began in March has continued into June.  Th e monthly pattern—3.7 percent in and less like a temporary bulge and more and more like a sustained increase .  It is worth noting that the current acceleration in core inflation is broadly based,  as the Greenbook emphasizes and President Poole ably articulated, and not attribut able to any narrow set of  special factors.   The annual revisions to the national inco me and product accounts once again raised inflation for past years, although not that much this time, as Pr esident Yellen noted.  It now appears that year-over-year core PCE inflation has exceeded 2 percent every month since April 2004. Perhaps the most striking change in th e annual revisions, however, was in wages and salaries. The puzzle of compensation growth bulging in 2005 and slowing in 2006 is now gone, and it is now clear that compensation is on a broad upswing.  The Board staff estimates that nonfarm business compensation per hour accelerated from a trend around 4 percent to something over 5½ percent. In fact, 5.4 percent was today’s release.  Unit labor costs have deteriorated accordingly and now show an annual rate of in crease of 4.2 percent in the second quarter, according to today’s release, and they are up 3.2 percent year over year.  Before the NIPA revisions, the behavior of unit labor  costs suggested that the current  increase in inflation was not being incorporated into nominal wage compensation, but the labor cost data now show exactly the opposite—that the acceleration of inflation in  recent months has induced a broad acceleration in nominal wages.  44 of 158        I find it hard to be confident that a surge in unit labor costs is likely to be absorbed by falling markups.  Measured markups have been trending up for some time, and I think they still do after the revision. Our economic understanding of  the determination of markups, especially at the macroeconomic level, is still quite limited.  In many models, the markup is entirely a real phenomenon and thus would be invariant with resp ect to purely nominal accelerations in costs.  The main exceptions are the sticky-price models, but these don’t provide much comfort because in them a high markup is a forecast of accelera ting nominal marginal cost—that is to say, an upswing in inflation. So I don’t take much  comfort from the high level of markups. Combining the growth and inflation outlooks , it is worth thinking carefully about the extent to which we can expect slowing growth  to bring inflation down.  There have been a number of skeptical comments about that hypothesis around the table today.  The relationship between output gaps and inflation is quite tenuous, as the staff rightly emphasizes whenever the subject comes up. Empirically, the ability to discover this relationshi p relies heavily on recessions and, thus, is much less reliable as an indicator of the effects on inflation of a small widening of the gap. Indeed, at our last mee ting and again today, David Wilcox characterized the effect of the expected path of the output gap on inflation over  the forecast period as tiny.   The combination of uncertainty about the relatio nship between output gaps and inflation and the uncertainty about the degree to which growth is likely to fall short of potential should, I think, leave us deeply skeptical about whether we can rely on expected moderation in growth to bring inflation down.  It is unfortunate that so ma ny commentators placed so mu ch weight on that in response to our last statement. Let me add a comment or two about President Yellen’s most excellent statement.  I think the insights she articulated about backward-looking inflation models breaking down and the 45 of 158       different inflation dynamics in forward-looki ng models is very important for our policy deliberations. Her staff apparently has documen ted that inflation now looks more as though it’s fluctuating around a sample average—I’ll say, a trend—and less as though it’s driven by output gap measures.  She concludes that we may see inflation fall faster than the Greenbook forecasts do. I want to register a couple of observati ons.  The first is that, with forward-looking expectations, inflation behavior is  far more sensitive to changes in the public’s beliefs about our behavior than in models in which inflation ex pectations formation is backward looking.  I’d register just the possibi lity that the long-run expected inflation that the public believes applies has been drifting around and may, in fact, account for some of the swings of measured inflation around sample averages. Finally, ce rtainly taking the point of view  that inflation expectations are formed in a forward-looking manner makes more  likely the possibility  that inflation will come down faster than the Greenbook states.  Bu t with inflation looking forward, it becomes our responsibility to bring th at about.  So that happy outcome c ould require our action and our strong communication, but I would welcome inspecting, if I could, the work  of President Yellen’s staff, and I welcome her contribution.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Plosser. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  It’s a pleasure to be here today at my first meeting.  Many people ar ound the table I’ve known for many, many years.  Others I don’t know so well, but I’m looking forwar d to getting to know you better.  I realize that as the new kid on the block, so to speak, I have a lot to learn.  I’ve been  on the job one week today, and that realization has been driven home to  me in the past week quite amply by the fact that I’ve struggled to prepare for this meeting.  I have to confe ss that it did occur to me at a 46 of 158          couple of points that maybe my start date shou ld have been moved to August 15.  [Laughter] sure yet. Nonetheless, I really  am honored to be here and to be a part of this group, and I’m looking forward to working with all of you. Economic activity in the Third District cont inues to expand at a moderate pace, albeit somewhat more slowly than earlier in the year.  Of  course, this was in line with expectations in previous reports by Bill Stone to  you.  Regional manufacturing ac tivity expanded in July.  Our business outlook survey’s index of general activit y fell to 6 in July, down from 13 in June, and the indexes of new orders and shipments also so ftened.  But the levels of these indicators continue to point to expansi on in terms of manufacturing in  the region and manufacturers’ expectations of future activity. Conditions in our construction sector are similar to what other people have been reporting. Nonresidential construction continues to strengthen in  our District.  Bankers are reporting increased strength in co mmercial real estate lending.  Office vacancy rates have been edging down, and rents have been moving up. Our business contacts exp ect those trends to continue. In contrast, as in much of the nati on, residential construction and home sales are down.  Residential mortgage lending has slowed considerably, although ho me equity lending has been quite strong. Realtors report that  the inventory of homes for sale is at the highest level they’ve seen in a number of years; they also report that prices are higher than they were last year, but the rate of appreciation tends to be softening. T hus far the slowing in the region’s residential housing sector seems to have been an orderly one. Retailers report a firming of sales in genera l merchandise in June and July, with sales at stores specializing in high-end merchandise be ing stronger than those at the lower end.  47 of 158         Manufacturers’ incentives have help ed boost auto sales in July in the region, but dealers tell us that inventories remain above their desired levels. Payroll employment in our three states has been expanding at a somewhat slower pace than in the nation as a whole, but  that’s not atypical of the re gion.  The unemployment rate has edged down. In June, it was 4.7 percent. In most  of the District’s labor  markets, unemployment is lower now than it was a year a go.  Our business contacts continue  to report difficulty in filling positions.  There has been some relief this summer with the influx of college students, but that cushion is about to end. It has be en particularly hard in the Dist rict for firms to fill professional and managerial positions.  Firms have received  a good number of applications, but many of the applicants are unqualified. Conse quently, salaries for these positions have risen more than others. Our manufacturers report that recent wa ge increases in the region are higher than they were last year. This is consistent with th e employment cost index, which shows stronger compensation growth in the Northeast than in othe r parts of the nation.  On  balance, the regional conditions and outlook continue to be positive.  The rate of expa nsion in the second half of the year is likely to be somewhat slower than in the first half; but, again, that was expected.   I’m more concerned about signs of continued and growing price pressures in the District.  Consumer prices appear to be ri sing at a faster pace in the Philad elphia region than in the nation as a whole. One factor contributing to the fast er pace has been the increase in housing costs in metropolitan Philadelphia, but that may prove to be temporary as housing prices stabilize.  Nonetheless, broad-based cost pressures persist in most sectors of the region.  The indexes of both prices paid and prices received in our ma nufacturing survey have increased in July, and both are at very high levels. Business contacts say that price pr essures continue to be one of their major concerns. 48 of 158        I would characterize the nationa l economy in a somewhat sim ilar way.  That is, right now I tend to be more concerned about inflation than I am about growt h.  I don’t view the second-quarter slowdown as necessarily a precurs or to a significant weakening of the economy going forward. The below-trend growth in th e second quarter was wi dely anticipated, and averaging over the first two quarters, as seve ral people have done, output  still grew at over 4 percent in the first two quarter s.  The slowdown in residentia l investment was expected, and much of the slowdown in consumer spending was due  to auto sales, which are volatile and which had grown very strongly in the first quar ter and considerably  less in the second. One surprise, however, did occur in the s econd-quarter numbers.  We expected business investment in equipment and software to slow la st quarter from its very  robust pace in the first quarter, but we didn’t expect an ou tright decline.  About half that  swing, it turns out, reflects the timing of business purchases, particularly of transportation and autos,  so the weakness in investment may be more about timing than it is  about trend.  Indeed, as  has been pointed out, corporate profits remain high, and capacity utiliz ation rates remain high, and these data continue to point to the underlying stre ngth in business investment. The July employment numbers released on Frid ay did little to cha nge my view of the economy.  Employment continues to grow at a re asonable pace, although somewhat slower than earlier in the year. In July, em ployment in the privat e sector expanded at it s fastest pace since Employment based on the household survey fell.  The unemployment rate increased 0.2 percent, but household employment has been volatile.  The decline of 34,000 jobs in July followed a gain of 387,000 jobs in the household survey in June .  If we abstract from the month-to-month 49 of 158         volatility in these numbers, the unemployment rate remains low for the first half of the year at about 4.7 percent. At this point, I believe the economic indicator s are consistent with sustained real growth near trend, as many people have suggested.  The benchmark GDP revisions suggest that trend might be a tad lower than we thought, but nonethele ss I think the risks to growth seem at least roughly balanced. The inflation picture, however, has not improved.  Despite a slowing economy, price increases have been accelerating. The increases have been broadly based, as has been pointed out by Bill Poole and others.  They are no longe r confined to energy a nd other commodities.  Indeed, in June the CPI rose less than did the CP I excluding energy.  Core inflation is above the range I consider to be consistent with price st ability, and to my mind, inflation risks remain tilted to the upside. The Greenbook’s baseline forecast has core inflation decelerating over the next year, but the staff has been marking up its fo recasted path of inflation over time as the acceleration in inflation ha s persisted.  Even with the projected deceleration, the baseline forecast has core PCE inflation remaining above 2 percent through 2007.   Given this persistence in inflation, unacceptably high inflation seems likely to be around for a while. A year ago I wouldn’t have said that .  In fact, I was in th e camp that thought it was mostly a relative price phenomenon, but that pos ition has become less compelling to me over the past year. The benchmark revisions to the GDP report show that both compensation per hour and unit labor costs have been trending up, not down as earlier data suggested.  Energy-price increases have not abated, suggesting that we ar e likely to see continued pass-through to core inflation, perhaps for some time.  Although th e Committee has brought the fed funds rate up appreciably from historically low levels, real interest rates to my mind are not high.  I don’t view 50 of 158      monetary policy as particularly restrictive at this point.  Thus, I have to put some weight on the Greenbook’s alternative scenario of persistently high infl ation, and that leads to particularly poor outcomes.  Even if I accept the baseline forecast as my point forecast, th e fact that inflation remains at a level above the range consistent w ith price stability for a considerable period is troubling. I am comforted by the fact that medium- a nd longer-term inflation expectations have remained relatively stable despite the acceleratio n in inflation.  That’s a testament to the credibility of the Fed in the marketplace—that it will keep inflation low. But how reasonable is it to think that inflation expectations will remain unchanged?  By allowing inflation to remain at a high level for a time—we are, after all, as several people have pointed out, in the third year of core inflation running above 2 percent—do we risk sending the message that we are willing to tolerate higher inflation?  If so, will expectati ons adjust accordingly?  As the model simulations of optimal policy paths and outcomes in chart 7 of  the Bluebook indicate, it’s very costly to get inflation back down once it has been above our object ive, particularly if e xpectations are allowed to increase. I believe that monetary policy has an important role to play in ensuring that the recent high inflation readings do not raise l onger-term inflation expectations.  Thank you.

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As has been observed, growth moderated in the second quarter largely as anticipated. The economy is perhaps returning to a sustainable pace of growth—one, I would add, that may be above the Greenbook forecast for next year.  As I thought about the Greenbook, much of it seemed pl ausible to me; but our  VAR models provide somewhat more rapid growth next year.  When I step back and think about various components of aggregate demand, it seems to me that we migh t get a bit more out of business investment in 51 of 158         equipment and software and net exports, a nd I think the supply side of the economy is sufficiently flexible to accommodate that. With regard to inflation and its prospects, li ttle has changed from the last meeting in my opinion, and I doubt much will change in the near te rm, or at least not much will change for the better in the near term.  This suggests to me th at we should be prepared to see core inflation running on a year-over-year basis near or above 2½ percent for several more months, perhaps several more quarters.  I haven’ t heard anything from the busine ss people with whom I’ve been in contact that suggests that a moderation of inflation is at hand or that aggregate demand, demand for goods and services, is slowing in an unanticipated way, except for what is turning out to be a pretty mediocre tourism season in our District. One distinctly positive development—and I thin k Charlie just referred to this—has been the stability of inflation expect ations in the face of incoming in formation on inflation that might have led to some upward revisi on in those expectations.  The fact that expectations have remained well anchored so far is so mething that looks positive to me. Overall, as I try to assess the risks, it seem s to me that the near-term inflation risks are tilted to the upside even though I continue to expect core infl ation to ease back down in the longer term.  As for the risks associated with growth, I think here uncertainty has increased.  However, against the background of the latest Greenbook forecast, I think maybe the risks to growth are also tilted to the upside. Only I w ouldn’t use the term “risks”—I would consider that to be a positive development if in fact it occurred. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, thank you.  Obvi ously we are dealing with a difficult set of circumstances.  We have information that th e growth of the economy is slowing and inflation 52 of 158      is rising, not something we particularly like to see.  We have seen slowing consumption nationally, and certainly our Distri ct has seen some of it.  The one exception is in some areas where we have an energy boom going on, which is not  necessarily advantageous to other parts of the country. We also have slow ing residential investment in our District.  Inventories are building up rapidly, both in the eastern side of th e District and in the Denver western side, and we have some pretty sharp increases in bankrup tcy levels in the Denver area.  The shocks of energy costs have affected consumption, and I thi nk that effect will carry through.  We have been more optimistic about manufacturing.  Even though our surveys have shown some slowdown recently, the six-months-ahead forecasts are still fairly optimistic. There is no denying that the inflation level is up, and I think that incr ease reflects past policy accommodation that is  still in play.  I also  think that some of the supply shocks are having their effects, and the shocks themselves are continuing forward.  That situation is being aggravated a bit for our District, and perhaps will be even more for the nation, by the drought that we are experiencing, which is reducing so me of the crop output in the area.  The outlook, therefore, is not particularly encouraging.  I think consumption will show some further slowing going forward, especially as we see further shocks in the economy  related to energy.  Some of the wealth effects related to the housing industry will also affect consumption going forward.  The outlook in terms of business fixed investment  is unclear.  BFI has been pretty good. The outlook seems fairly good right now, but it is slowing to some degree.  Policy is moderately, not significantly, restrictive, but  it seems to be working its  way through fairly slowly. While these factors are in place, we worry about  whether the real rate will decline, which I think Mike Moskow mentioned.  I also worry that  the decline will affect inflation expectations and cause them to shift—that is an upside risk to  the economy in terms of the inflation that I do 53 of 158      worry about. Still, I suggest that we are m oving as expected.  We have some short-term inflationary pressures that are goi ng to continue, that are “baked in  the cake,” as they say.  And I do worry that—as we move forward and if the economy slows, as I suspect it will—our big challenge will be not to ease too soon. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want  to offer just a few anecdotes, starting with Wal-Mart.  At the beginning of the year, Wal-Mart’s plan for same-store sales was for growth of 3 percent to 5 percent, but growth has run persistent ly below that since Easter.  July came in at 2.6 percent.  They had expected a range of 1 to 3 percen t.  However, I think we have to be a little careful in interp reting July data in general because it was unusually hot over much of the country, and Wal-Mart says that they particularly sold a lot of what  they call “hot weather goods,” like air conditioners and fans. My cont act says that higher-priced items with higher the lower-income shoppers at Wal-Mart.  Food inflation is actually coming down a bit:  It is now below 1 percent. My contact ob served that suppliers seem to  have paused in taking price increases, but he’s not sure whether that’s just pa rt of a cycle during the y ear.  He also noted that the rate of price deflation is also less than it  was for a number of items—particularly apparel and standard electronics items—that have been deflating for quite a number of years.  Those prices are still declining but not as rapidly as before. I had two readings from the transportation i ndustry suggesting that July was surprisingly weak. UPS Express volume in July came in 3 percent to 4 percent below plan, and a large trucking company said that the Ju ly truck volume was flat year  over year and the weakness was pretty much spread over all parts of the country, although more pronounced in the upper 54 of 158      Midwest. It seems to be broadly based in terms of product category.  He sa id that in the trucking industry, or at least in his firm, they are increasingly nervous about recession. UPS noted that there is poten tial for disruption.  Their pi lots’ union is currently in a ratification vote, which is suppos ed to be complete by Septembe r 1.  There’s a great deal of opposition within the union and some genuine possibi lity that the contract will be voted down, with associated job actions and disruption of various  sorts.   My FedEx contact said he really had nothing new, and he didn’t even want to talk about that.  [Laughter] Let me make a comment about the national economy.  I want to talk about it in terms of the risks we face and to use a Ph illips curve diagram as a device.  We’ll center the axes on the Greenbook forecast. One of the quadrants here has higher growth and lower inflation than forecast. I think we’re not very likely to be in that quadrant—it’s not impossible, but I don’t think it’s probable. So let’s talk about the other three quadrants.  One of them has good growth and higher inflation. We could e nd up in that quadrant, and that  would just mean that we’re going to have the problem of dealing with the inflation over the longer haul even though our immediate future might not have a growth complication.  Quite frankly, I think we’re most likely going to be dealing with one of the other two quadrants.  One of  them has lower growth with we’re actually most likely going to end up in the very unfortunate quadrant where we have sustained inflation pressures r unning at the Greenbook fo recast rate or above and growth running at that rate or lower. That situation is going to be very uncomfortable for us, but we’re going to have to be ready to deal with it. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman Geithner.  55 of 158   

[SECTION]

   VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  Growth has moderated, but the economy still seems, to us at least, likely to grow at a reasonably good pace over the forecast period, somewhere in the vi cinity of 3 percent.  We expect core inflation to moderate gradually from current levels, dec lining to around 2 percent in ’07.  This forecast assumes that monetary policy follows a path fairly close to what’s in th e market and in the Greenbook. The key difference between our view of the outlook and that of the Greenbook forecast is in the strength of demand growth relative to potential next year.  We have reduced a bit our estimate of potential and also of actual growth, but we still expect the economy to expand at a rate close to potential. This is a very favorable  forecast, and we have to recognize, of course, that the economy is going through a set of extr emely complicated transi tions, including a large, adverse, sustained relativ e price shock of uncertain duration a nd a substantial adjustment in asset prices that is now concentrated in housing. Our capacity to anticipate the evolution of these forces and to assess their effect on growth and in flation is, of course, very limited.  The forces that now appear to be working on the economy s till present the unpleasant combination of upside risk to inflation and downside risk to growth; but for the moment we believe that the former, the possibility that our forecast is too optimis tic on inflation, remains the predominant risk. I have a few points on the growth outlook.  The economy has clearly slowed, and the composition of growth within the United States and here relative to the rest of the world has changed. These changes were inevitable, and if  they continue to occur smoothly, they seem desirable and necessary.  As a share of aggreg ate demand within the United States, residential investment had to contract and consumption had to slow.  And U.S. domestic demand had to slow relative to domestic demand growth in the rest of the world.  The key issue we face is 56 of 158        judging whether we have significan tly more weakness ahead of us than we are now expecting.  In our view, most signs at present point to fundamentally healthy economic conditions. The survey-based measures of confidence are holding up okay.  R eal household income growth seems likely to be good going forward.  Bu sinesses have the resources and the motivation to sustain fairly strong rates of investment gr owth.  Structural producti vity growth, even post-revision, still seems strong.  Inventory levels remain relatively thin, and the tentativeness that characterized much of the expa nsion in terms of investment and hiring should be a source of some comfort.  Global demand is still quite strong, of course, and together these forces will offset part, but not all, of the weakness coming from the adjustment in housing and consumption growth. The principal risk to this outlook for gr owth lies in the possibil ity that households will slow consumption more sharply because of risi ng energy costs, higher interest rates, greater pessimism about future income gains, or the effect of the housing adjustment on perceived wealth. Financial markets are showing a little more concern about futu re growth, but not a lot.  This concern is most evident in the greater inve rsion in the yield curve that has emerged at the one-year to two-year horizon. I think you can see in the market some moderation of exuberance in credit markets, but just a littl e.  Overall, the markets seem to reflect a reasonably favorable view of future growth prospects. On the inflation side, as I said, we expect co re inflation to moderate, not quickly and not dramatically but by enough and soon enough to bri ng core PCE inflation down to just below 2 percent over the next 18 months.  The issue we  face is not so much about the acceleration in core inflation that occurred in late 2003 and 2004.  After that acceleration, core inflation was sort of trendless, in the vicinity of 2 percent for much of the two-year period, until the past six 57 of 158       months, when we saw this uptick. The real problem we face is assessing the extent to which the very recent acceleration in co re inflation reflects transitory factor s, such as the indirect effects of energy prices, and the extent to which it may re flect pressures from higher resource utilization and other things less benign and less transitory. Energy pass-through, of course, seems part of it, but probably not all of it. Shelter doesn’t account for all of it either.  This judgment is critical for us, and we need to be careful that we’re not assuming away the more unc omfortable explanation, such as a broader inflationary impulse or a rise  in pricing power that could reflect increasing acceptance of higher inflation. How confident can we be that the pressures that  have induced this ri se in core inflation will moderate sufficiently to bring down the rate of  increase in core PCE prices to the vicinity of 2 percent or below?  Reasonably confident, I th ink.  With the economy gr owing at or slightly below trend, with growth of unit labor costs peaking and decelerating a bit as the Greenbook forecast anticipates, with inflation expectations moderating at short horizons and pretty stable at longer-run horizons, with energy prices flattening out, and with the dollar falling only a little, this forecast seems reasonable.  But note the number of assumptions and conditions this forecast depends on. Also, the expected path for infla tion implies only a very gradual moderation and a period of sustained inflation above what is presumed to be cons istent with this central bank’s long-term preferences.  The risks of this forecast, as I said, still seem to lie on the upside.  It may be some time before we can be confident that  the forces are in place to produce the necessary moderation. More generally, however, we face the very di fficult consequential challenge of trying to figure out the longer-term consequences of ha ving been in an exceptionally long period of exceptionally low real interest ra tes—both real short rates and fo rward rates—that were induced 58 of 158     by monetary authorities here a nd around the world.   Real shor t rates now look as though they were perhaps lower relative to the estimates of equilibrium even than we thought.  Perhaps more remarkable was the low level of forward real rates during much of our tightening phase.  These financial conditions may have produced more inflation momentum than we thought, and this Those expectations are substantially be low the peak in ’04 at the long horizon. However, the rise in asset prices and reside ntial investment and the leverage caused by this long period of very expansionary monetary policy may lead to a process of adjustment in asset prices that could be more sustained a nd more damaging in terms of confidence and of demand than we expect.  This risk is greater if we end up allowing more inflation than our forecast anticipates, for the required monetary  policy response could induce an even sharper adjustment in risk premiums and asset prices.  This possibility argues for a lot of humility in judging the appropriateness of the present st ance of monetary polic y and what will be appropriate over time, and it argues mostly for having as much flexibility as we can going forward, emphasizing that the inflation risks rema in the predominant concern of the Committee.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As many of you have remarked, the inflation news over the intermeeting period was not favorable.  Core consumer prices continued to run at an elevated level, and the CPI actually came in on the high side of expecta tions.  The shortfall in the PCE that President Yellen re ferenced was, I think, more of those mysterious nonmarket components.  Petroleum prices rose further,  implying additional f eed-through going forward.  Prices of other commodities, as Karen remarked, were on average unchanged to somewhat 59 of 158     higher, suggesting not only continuing cost pressures on producers but sustained strength in global demand.  Early estimates of unit labor costs for the second half of last year and the first half of this year show a fa ster increase than had been estimated and anticipated.  The compensation data for the early part of this year, in particular, are subject to very large revisions.  Even the now-faster growth doesn’t necessarily  indicate that the economy has been operating beyond its sustainable potential, given the like lihood of some catch-up w ith past productivity gains, the still quite elevated pr ofit margins, and the moderate in crease in the ECI.  But at the very least, the unit labor cost story doesn’t provi de as much comfort about future inflation as it did previously. Largely as a consequence, the staff revised up its infla tion forecast for 2006 and 2007, and that response seems reasonable to me. At the same time, some developments over th e intermeeting period he lp me feel a touch more comfortable, or perhaps a touch less unc omfortable, with the downward trajectory for inflation after the bulge.  One of them that a nu mber of you have mentioned from surveys is that the long-term inflation expectati ons in the market remained stab le or even edged down a little despite higher energy prices and, importantly, de spite downward revisions to the expected path of monetary policy.  If I were forecasting today, I would forecast a slightly higher inflation rate, but I would also forecast a slig htly higher unemployment rate than  I did before.  To be sure, output gaps, as you’ve mentioned, don’t play a large role in dete rmining inflation, but certainly the growth of demand relative to potential has so me effect on the competitive conditions that businesses are facing and on their ability to pass through costs. From the information that we received ove r the intermeeting period, growth slightly below the growth rate of the ec onomy’s potential seems more likely than it seemed a month or so ago, and this would inhibit the pass-through of higher energy and labor costs.  Weakness in the 60 of 158     housing sector has deepened, and we have not yet seen the full implications of the rise in long-term and short-term interest rates over the firs t half of the year.  This weakness seems to be having an effect on housing prices as well as on activity.  The effects of a lower expected trajectory for housing wealth and th e increase in interest rates th is year haven’t begun to show through to consumption, judging from the minus  1½ percent saving rate .  The energy-price increases of recent weeks will take something more out of consumption. Recent data are consistent with a below-trend track for the growth of economic activity:  Private domestic final purchases increased at a rate  of only 2 percent in the second quarter.  The consumption and investment data for late months in the quarter don’t suggest an acceleration going into the third quarter. The growth of empl oyment has been running slightly below what would be a steady-state pace if participation were  to remain stable, and participation has edged higher. The greater increase than had been an ticipated in inventorie s in the second quarter suggests little impetus or even a small drag from  inventory accumulation in the third and fourth quarters. The growth of federal government spending seems to be dropping back a bit as Katrina-related expenditures top out. Moreover,  the recent higher rates of core inflation, though they are puzzling to a considerable  extent, must reflect some influences that are unlikely to be repeated indefinitely into the future. One of thos e is the rise in oil and energy prices.  The recent rise clearly has been associated with escalating tension in the Mideast an d other producing areas, as well as the recent cutback in supply from Alaska.  At some point, the risks of supply disruptions, while remaining very high, should le vel out.  As a consequence, so, too, should energy prices, which will reduce core inflation as the feed-through fades. Another factor boosting inflati on in recent months was rela ted to rising rents and, in particular, to an even greater increase in owners ’ equivalent rent.  The staff has assumed that 61 of 158      owners’ equivalent rent will rise in line with other rents and that  both will continue to increase fairly rapidly but less rapidly th an they did.  That seems reasona ble to me, given the increased availability of houses and apartments on the market that would, at some point, seem to limit the rise in rents as well as house prices. So my conclusion is that the staff forecast of  a gradual moderation of core inflation after the second quarter is a reasonable expectation, although I am very worried about upside risks to inflation. The inflation rate l ooks as though it will end up a tad highe r than either the staff or I thought likely at the time of our June meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Bies. MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think our decision today is going to be a close call because of the recent information we’ve gotte n both on inflation and on the growth of the economy.  We know that, as President Poole an d others have mentioned, wage and price inflation has been accelerating and is fairly broadly based.  The recent NIPA revisions also concern me because of the faster growth in core PCE prices that those data show.  The business surveys, in fact, show that companies feel they have more pricing power than they have had in the past. We know that we are going to have some continuing feed-through of the higher prices of oil. After talking to some folks in the oi l industry, I am concerned about the recent Alaska situation. It clearly shows that maintenance of equipment and the efficiency of the operations of some of these companies may be under stress with  the high volumes of capacity at which they have been running. We pray that it doesn’t extend much further in additional surprises. What also concerns me about the NIPA revisions are the change s in the productivity numbers.  The fact that with the NIPA revisions we are seeing lower productivity and faster-rising labor costs has implications  for our forward expectations on inflation.  We also see that 62 of 158      business investment in equipment and software  was much lower.  That downward revision worries me because it implies that less capital deep ening has occurred, and that would have been a strong base to support productivity going forwar d.  Now we apparently cannot rely on it as a base as much as we could before the revisions. In terms of the housing markets, the rapid es calation of home sale cancellations clearly has been very surprising. Agai n, the gross sales figures don’t show this, but the information we’ve got on the cancellations indicates a much  more pronounced slowdown than we might have expected. In looking through other housing cycles and in talking to  bankers and lenders, one of the good things I find is that the industry learned in the 1980s.  Be cause those in the industry are more sophisticated in the way they manage their land costs and their invent ory, I think the length of the cycle is unlikely to be as  long.  In the 1980s, bankers made  plenty of funds available for companies to continue to develop land and to put in infrastructure.  When the housing bubble burst, all of a sudden we had uns old housing units.  They had to be sold before builders could start building on the developments that had already been laid out, and it took us several years to work through that. This time we  don’t have the unfinished inve ntory of developments that we had in the ’80s.  So I think that the cycle is likel y to be much shorter than  it was then and that it will put some firmness in that market.  At the same time, this is the sector, aside from energy and commodities, that had a very rapid rise in prices , and it’s good that we’re seeing some correction in those prices right now. The other good trend that I take comfort in is the one that Dino mentioned earlier—that we’re seeing central banks around the world raising rates.  When we started raising our rates a couple of years ago, there weren’ t too many moving at the same ti me we did.  We know that today monetary policy has global effects:  Ex cessive accommodation in so me countries clearly 63 of 158               can affect investments in other c ountries.  So I think we now have support in what we’re doing to remove accommodation.  We’re seeing that support  more broadly across the world; and in the aggregate, then, it will help to moderate infl ation in the period going forward.  Finally, I’m reminded that we do have long lags in monetary po licy, and we still have to  see the full impact of what we have already put in train. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. David Wilcox has a couple of comm ents on the productivity data from this morning. MR. WILCOX.  Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  Just very briefly, these data came in, in most respects, pretty close to our expectation.  I would note that the productivity  figures for the second quarter are built on the output data  that were incorporat ed in last week’s ad vance GDP number.  We expect nonfarm business productivi ty in the second quarte r to be revised up.  Based on information available today, it would be revised up 0.8 percentage point, to 1.9 percent.  Probably because of some fluctuations in hours, the productivity number in Q1 is 0.3 pe rcentage point stronger than we had expected.  In Q2, it’s 0.3 percentage point weaker.  On bala nce, the profile th ere looks much as we had expected.  Compen sation per hour is 0.5 percentage point stronger in Q1 than we had projected and right on our Greenbook projection in Q2.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Th ank you.  Let’s turn now  to Governor Warsh. 

[SECTION]

MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Treasur y markets have convinced themselves in recent days and weeks of the prospect s of lower growth, lower rates, and some degree of comfort with inflation, and they  seem to have lurched to that on a somewhat accelerated basis in 64 of 158               the past several weeks. But with  some degree of humilit y, I’ll say I’m not qui te as convinced as they are. I suspect that they ma y lose some of their co nviction if some of th e data that we’ve all talked about this mo rning around this table come to pass.  So we need to be keen in looking at inflation expectations, at the shap e of the curve, and at the prices of some of these Treasury securities to evaluate  the market reaction to what we do.   I have just a couple of other general comments .  We’ll have readings on inflation soon, but I’m not persuaded that we will have a good view of how persistent inflation w ill likely be.  I suspect it will continue to trend to  the upside and will beg t hose markets for a further review of the state of inflation expectations.  Si milarly, I am not sure we ’re going to have definiti ve views on growth.  I had a lot of discussions w ith a whole host of folks in the consumer and business sectors.  They are hearing, much as we are, top-down estimates fo r lower growth in the se cond half, but their own bottom-up analysis doesn’t seem to be bearing that out even here in the se cond quarter.  The only thing I’d note at the outset from  the BEA revisions is that, thou gh growth has come down somewhat over the historical period, quarter-over-quarter variance  seems to be at least as  pronounced as it was in the original dataset; so the data are lik ely to be rather volatile, I would suspect, as we look through the forecast period. With that in mind, I thought I’d take a couple of minutes looking at growth in the consumer and business sectors and then spen d a few moments on inflation.  With respect to the consumer sector, I am probably more  convinced at this meeting than even before that great tumult is going on below the surface.  In discussions with some of the big credit card processors, I asked them to tell me what they’re seeing.  They’re seeing huge changes in categories of purchases and even in the types of purchases if we exclude energy and gas products.  In su m, however, consumer spending looked quite strong to most of them through June and, importantly, through the firs t month of the 65 of 158            third quarter. Although they had talked to their boards about lowe r volume in the second half, they have yet to see it in much of  their data across a range of lower-income American s as well as Americans with higher net worth.  They’re not seeing  much softness at all.  The other piece coming out of those discussions is that they had expected to see a ramp -up in delinquencies—again, with much vaunted news of a slowing housing sector, higher energy pric es, and a slower second half— and they have not. The news about delinquencies continues to be very encouraging going into the third quarter. It also raises the question of whether or not we’re go ing to see an infl ection point. With all the discussions about th e slower second half, we would have expected that personal consumption would have shown some more-meaningful effect than th e data suggest.  So I’m not persuaded that several meetings from now we’re going to have th is “aha” moment and that we’re going to see this inflection point.  On the grow th front, I still have the view  that growth continues to be above the Greenbook projectio n.  But I am more concerned,  of course, about inflation. I have just a couple of other points of interest on the cons umer front.  The July index of consumer sentiment does not sugg est much of a slowdown in c onsumer confidence, and when I looked at the surveys since our la st meeting, I came to a couple of conclusions.  When the surveys ask questions such as “How are you doing?” and “What is  your personal financial condition?” the numbers tend to go in a rather positive direction.  “I’m doing pretty well, not great” is the answer, if you cut through the data.  When the surveys ask other questions such as “How is your neighbor doing? or “What is the state of the economy or th e state of business cond itions?” the answer we’re getting is, “Well, my neighbor is having all sorts of tro ubles.”  If we’re  trying to judge  the economy by what folks know best of all, I guess I don’t see much  of a reason to expe ct that some of the worst-case scenarios will come to pass. 66 of 158              Federal tax receipts, which I mention at most of our meetin gs, for July sh owed year-over­year growth of about 13 percent.   The gains in wages and salaries  implied by these increased tax collections finally make so me more sense in light of the recasting of the official data from last week’s revisions, with real wages and salaries having risen 3.4 percent over the past year, which is about a six-year high. Turning now to the business sect or, I put myself as probably as  confident as most around the table on the state of this sector, though I have heard some talk of a diminution in “animal spirits.”  But if you look at the data, you see that, as discussed this morning, th e ratio of profits to GDP is at a record high.  Momentum continues to be quite strong, with credit spread s low, acceleration in business sales, and low ratios of inventories to sales; all these factors seem to speak to some underlying strength. The manufacturing sector, despite some noisy data on jobs and employment, appears to be in an incredibly strong  position.  The ISM manuf acturing index, PMI, an d industrial production, which advanced at an annual ra te of about 6.6 percent during th e second quarter,  are all very positive indicators about the manufacturing sector.  We  also continue both to hear anecdotes and to see data about real pricing power in that sector, whic h is good news on the growth front and probably gives us a co uple of questions on the inflation front. Finally, Dino referred at the out set to some of the bottom-up an alyst estimates for profits in the second quarter an d the second half, and I said a couple of  meetings ago that we should really take note of these to see whether they flatten out.  They appear to be possibly flattening out a touch, but you have to do quite a bit of work to get there.  Second-quarter profits will end up above 15 percent once the S&P companies all report.  Some  lower earnings guidance is being given over the forecast period; but throughout that period, earnings would still be up 11 percent or so compared 67 of 158                 with similar quarters last year—all  of which is quite encouraging an d comes as surprisingly positive news to boards of directors of  these companies, who had heard about the slowdown but aren’t seeing it so dramatically. One area about which I spok e earlier was the capita l expenditure number in the second quarter.  President Plosser probably summarized the point well in explaining that we should probably look through that num ber because of some volatile tr ansportation-related orders.  Moreover, when I look at the second half of this  year and at 2007, othe r data on unfilled orders appear very positive.  Pent-up demand for cap-ex should be higher, given that the past three years had growth rates of 6.4 pe rcent rather than the 8.3 percent that we had earlier anticipated.  The only other thing I would note about cap-ex  is that there seems to be great er dispersion by industry and by sector. Technology and telecom do seem to be more disciplined in  this cap-ex wave than maybe many of us, including myself, woul d have anticipated.  I suspect th at, with continue d talk about the slowdown in the second half, spen ding on tech and tel ecom will be bumpy and may drag some of the aggregate cap-ex number s down substantially.  As  I look at the business  sector, I find myself asking the key question of whether this industrial ec onomy, as robust as I think it is, will boost labor demand and personal income.  I suspect the answer to that question is “yes”; but again, it’s hard to be too definitive at this point. On the inflation front, I shar e the views expressed by most fo lks around the table of some degree of calmness and pl easure about the stability of inflatio n expectations.  But when I think about what has happened to the bond market, particul arly in the past couple of weeks, and the rather robust moves that the bond market made at the end of last week, I could be easily persuaded that those inflation expectations will mo ve against us as data come in between this meeting and the next.  68 of 158                   I would probably describe many of these inflation expectations as relatively calm; but if I had to guess, I’d say that they’re probably a bit more wobbly than  we would like. Further on the bad news fr ont, and I think President Fisher and President Poole made reference to this, no matte r how we slice some of th e core PCE data and some  of the CPI data, even if we look at things like non-energy services, the trend is not our friend on a three-month or six-month average.  Most of us would not expect it to be our fr iend over the next six months.  Again, the question is how  persistent the trend is, and I have ge nuine concerns on th at front.  As the inflation data are likely to deteriorate, we obviou sly have to look at a br oad range of GDP outcomes for the balance of 2006.  In pa rticular, I took note of the Green book’s simulation of persistent inflation to a 3 percent core, which I would cons ider a genuine risk, an d although the Greenbook simulation suggests that the fed fu nds rate would need to  go only to 5.9 percen t, I’m probably more concerned that we might have mo re work to do if that seri es of events came to pass. Finally, let me quickly note the labor compensation front.  I believe that many of the gains shown on that front have been quite surprising on the upside.  They have been good news for most workers over the past coup le of years, and they help explain that conundrum, which we’ve heard as each of us have sat be fore this table and been asked on Capitol Hill:   How is it that productivity is so remarkably high and compensation so remarkably low?  Have the gains to trade and to capital and labor changed?  I think these data suggest that they haven’t.  If, in fact, we do see continued acceleration in compensation gains— even, as the Greenboo k suggests, to 5½ pe rcent—I suspect the inflationary than many of us around the tabl e believe.  I think that’s another concern. On balance, I’d summarize my  own position as being consid erably more concerned about the inflation picture than about the growth pictur e.  As Vice Chairman Geithner said, there are 69 of 158                 confidence intervals around all of these that are hard for us to bang the ta ble in support of.  The work that we have from this meeting to the next will become par ticularly important.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  Governor Kroszner. 

[SECTION]

MR. KROSZNER. Thank you very  much.  As the comm ents indicate, this  is probably the most challenging time that we have had before us in  my long history here at the FOMC.  [Laughter] The mix of continuing inflation pressures and decelerating growth are providing more concerns on both fronts than I have heard aroun d the table and than I myself have had since I’ve been here. First let’s think about some of  the growth prospects.  I broa dly share the Vice Chairman’s view that the fundamentals are in place for reason able growth going forwar d.  Certainly there are some risks.  But whether we are looking at survey-based measures, at orders and shipments, or at a variety of different things, we don’ t really see signs of very signifi cant deceleration or contraction. We see more a moderation that would be either in  line with the Greenbook or a b it lower than the Greenbook.   Certainly a key risk to growth that a lot of pe ople have discussed is residential investment.  If you look at where we are in residential investme nt, we’re back only to mid-2003; 2004  and 2005 were incredibly strong years.  So being in 2003 is not that bad.  If  you look at the graph, residential investment falls off rather precipitously to get us back to 2003 with great rapidity.  The question I have is whether it w ill flatten out or whether it  will go down further.  Th e Greenbook fo recasts have gradually been moving down and now reflect more downward pressure  going forward.  I think that we’re not seeing the full effects on house prices reflected in th e numbers because in the housing changes.  So it may take a while for the price data to actually reflect the lower effe ctive prices that 70 of 158            people are seeing. Obviously ho use prices will have a potentially important effect on the wealth effect and on consumptio n down the line, which I think the Greenbook does  a good job of putting into place. Another challenge is elevat ed prices for energy and co mmodities.  Energy prices, particularly, may be taki ng a little bite out of pe ople’s disposable income.  On the other hand, we have been seeing continued stro ng business fixed investment.  A small concern I ha ve is, if we continue to hear about slowing consumption and re ports from Wal-Mart and others that retailing is really slowing, why are these busi nesses producing?  Are they i nvesting to produce goods that people will want to buy, or will we see in nine months or  a year that maybe some misallocation of resources has occurred and that things aren’t as strong as we had thought?  Ther e’s no particular sign of such misallocation of investment.  It just  seems that there is a bit of tension between the discussions of continued strength of capital expe nditures and the statements  of business contacts that they are going to continue to  invest even though th ey see a slowing coming down the lin e.  This is a variation of what Governor Warsh was saying—it’s almost as th ough they are sa ying that some other sector will have that  slowing, not their sector. In some sense, we should take very cold comfort from the fact th at the economy may be slowing.  We had quite a discussion  about how there’s not much of an  inflation–output tradeoff, but at least in this period there are real questions of  whether you do get much benefit in terms of lower inflation from slower growth.  Th ere may be some benefit, but it se ems to be attenuated compared with the past.  Obviously some of the recent numbers on inflatio n continue to be  worrisome, but fortunately both the survey me asures and the market-based measures seem to be reasonably contained looking forward.  Survey measures, whether of the man in the street or of the professional forecaster, seem to be quite flat.  The TIPS  rates for both the near-term forwards and the 71 of 158                longer-term forwards have not m oved up much.  Some of  the near-term forwards have moved up a bit, but that doesn’t seem surprising given the rise in energy prices that we have seen both from the Middle East and from issues in Alaska. The real key is looking forward as to what is likely to occur.  Are the things we’re seeing now transitory factors or persistent factors? That’s a very, very diff icult call.  Reasonable arguments have been made that a number of these factors, particularly with respect to shelter services, are perhaps a bit more short-lived.  Shel ter services are about 19 percent of core PCE and about 30 percent of core CPI, an d obviously they have been lead ing the band up.  As many people have said, we have been seeing pr ice increases in a lot of areas, but I don’t put  quite as much stock in that because many of the categor ies in both the PC E and the CPI are arbitrary.   The issue is really what the relative size and the relative importance ar e.  Shelter services and owners’ equivalent rent, which composes a vast majority of  shelter services, are an important  piece.  I think that there’s a reasonable chance that this factor is likely to be trans itory, although it may la st for several months and possibly quarters.  But that is  the key question—whether these forc es are likely to be transitory or likely to be more persistent.  Coming back to inflation exp ectations, that’s really where I see the markets both registering their view of persistence and te lling us something abou t whether they believe that we will keep inflation well contained.  At leas t so far, those expectations are suggesting that we will.  It’s extremely import ant that we maintain those ex pectations.  It’s ve ry costly to try to  regain credibility if credibility is lost. I think th e markets are willi ng to say, “Well, there may be some transitory inflation, and we’re willi ng to wait and see whether to mark up our longe r-term expectations.”  Certainly once longer-term expecta tions are marked up, the situa tion becomes high ly problematic because it’s very difficult to rein  in the changes in expectations, particularly in behavior.  So 72 of 158              basically I think we need to keep a very, very watchful eye on  where expectations are going.  I’m heartened that they haven’t moved too far despite, as many  people have said, high core PCE prices for a number of years and elevated  levels in the most recent numbe rs.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  Let me briefly summ arize what I’ve heard and add a few comments. I th ink one thing we can conclude is that  this is not getting any easier.  [Laughter] Starting w ith the data, which are no t cooperating, the NIPA  revisions show that potential growth may be less than we thought and, therefore, we may have to have more of a slowdown, if we belie ve in the Phillips curv e, to begin to contain inflatio n.  The small bit of comfort I take is that the slowdown in potential and produc tivity appears to be comi ng from capital rather than from multifactor pr oductivity; so at least that technological componen t still seems to be with us. The question is whet her we are, in fact, slowing to potentia l or to slightly be low potential.  I agree with most of what I heard around the table, which is that there is evidence of slowing but, except for the residential construction sector, it is no t yet at all definitive that we are falling below potential growth rates.  For example, the staff esti mated that GDP growth in  the second quarter was 3 percent. The staff also estimated that the slower rate of job cr eation we saw in the second quarter is still fairly close to what  is needed to ke ep the unemployment rate constant.   We are certainly seeing areas of strength in the economy, as a number of people noted.  That includes the industrial sector—whi ch will grow 0.7 or 0.8 percen t, something like that, overall in a net decline in construction jobs in  the United States.  So there ce rtainly are some strong elements of the economy. 73 of 158            I’d like to talk about the very important housing sector, in terms not of the expected level but of the variance of our forecast, which I think we must think about given our risk-management approach.  At least three dimensions of the housing sector provide significant uncertainty as we look forward.  The first is the extent to which sales, starts, and permits will decline.  Th e correction in the housing market so far app ears to be fairly substan tial.  In 2005, we had 1.72 milli on starts.  For level of construction.  As Governor Kroszner pointed out, the curve doesn’t look as though it’s flattening out; it looks as though  it’s heading directly south.  We have heard anecdotally that cancellations are up very sharply.  Inventories are ri sing significantly, and I note that, just since the last meeting, the GDP cont ribution estimated by the st aff for housing construction went from minus 0.3 percent to minus 0.6 per cent.  So there is, I think, a lo t of uncertainty about where that sector is going to level out. Second, associated with that consideration is a lot of uncer tainty about housing prices.  Again, as Governor Kroszner noted, we don’t really have much  information on what the “true price” of housing is at this point because of the wa y this market works:  Pe ople leave things on the don’t really see the transaction prices in any kind of quality-adjusted or reliable way for some time after the decline begins.  The prices are signifi cant, of course, both be cause they affect the profitability of future construction and because they are, at this point, an important component of household wealth; we know th at these factors are like ly to affect spending. Finally, a third element of uncertainty as we look into the forecast is what I would call parameter risk, which is that the staff assumes th at the effect of housing wealth on consumption spending is, through the standard wealth effect, about four cents on the dollar.  I happen  to think that 74 of 158             is a good estimate.  I think the econometric calculations are persuasi ve.  Nevertheless, there is the possibility that the e ffect is somewhat greater, perhaps operat ing through liquidit y effects.  There about spending in order to avoid eliminating th eir buffer of reserves.  Thus there is the possibility that housing will have a stronger eff ect on consumption than we now expect. I don’t know what the expected growth rate is.  If I had to take a guess, I would say that we’re going to be close to or slig htly below potential go ing forward, but I simp ly want to point out that our forecast may have a hi gher variance now than it does under normal circumstances. Let me say just a few words ab out inflation.  I heard a lot of concern about inflation around the table.  I certainly share that concern, and I don’t ex pect any near-term impr ovement, if for no other reason than that these things tend to be highly inertial.  I also agree with the general observation that the pickup is fairly broad based, as I discussed in the meeting last time.  One indicator of that is the share of goods that have  price increases or price increases above a certain level. I tried a somewhat different exercise, and I didn’t do it in any way as an apologist for inflation—I want to be very clear .  But I think it’s usef ul to look at inflation from a different approach, which is to ask what share of the inflation acceleration is attributable to different components.  So I asked for a look  at the past three months vers us the past twelve months to examine the acceleration between those two periods.  In a sort of growth -accounting exercise, how can we distribute that accelerati on among different components? I have just a few observations from that exer cise.  First, the shelte r component really does play a big role.  For example, in this particular calculation, which is somewhat sensitive to sample period, of the 71 basis point in crease in the core CPI between twelve months and three months, 75 of 158             48 basis points were associated w ith the shelter increase.  So that  component is significant, and our views on where it will go and how that relates to th e developments in  the housing mark et need to be thought about.  A second observatio n is that we are seeing energy  pass-through, a good example being air fares, which have jumped significantly and which by themse lves contribute 19 basis points to the acceleration.  So energy pa ss-through is real.  A somewhat  more subtle po int, which was made in the Greenbook a nd which I think is intere sting, is that there’s a little different  behavior between inflation in goods and infla tion in non-energy, nonshelter services.  Inflation in services has been generally flat.  In goods, however, we have seen a bit of acceleration , from a negative number in ’05 to a slightly positiv e number in ’06.  Examples would be the rise in prices  in apparel and, more recently, in used ca rs.  In just examining clues, I thin k that acceleration might say something about international compe tition, the effects of the declining dollar, and the possibility that import competition has weakened to some extent and is allowi ng prices of tradable goo ds to rise a bit more quickly. One theme that is consistent regarding the energy pass-through an d the perhaps slightly greater inflation in tradable goods is that an important component of the infla tion is product market tightness as opposed to labor market  tightness.  That suggests that, as  we go forward,  we should pay a lot of attention to final dema nd and consumption and see how they are affecting the product that, if the product markets slow and the slowing reduces pricing power , as we call it, those effects will ultimately have effects on the markup that will offset some of the wage effects.  So those are just a few observations about the economy.  To summarize, I agree with the sentiment around the table that there is a lot of unce rtainty going forward, particularly in the housing sector, but that the inflation ri sks at this point are still dominant and that our policy action and 76 of 158                                                             statement should reflect the greater concern with inflation.   On the subject of policy, let me now turn to Brian, who will present the policy options. 

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN.2 As shown in the top panel of exhibit 1, the pr obability of a 25 basis point firming at this meeting implied by federal funds futures quotes trended down over the intermeeting period.  Policy expectations were boosted briefly by higher-than-expected inflation readings, but those increases were more than offset by Federal Reserve policy communications and several economic data releases—most recently, the July employment report—that cam e in weaker than market participants had anticipated. The pattern of declining expectations of firming at the upcoming meeting stands in sharp contrast to the previous experience in this tightening cycle, in which market expectations of firming generally rose over intermeeting periods, converging to a level close to 100 percent by a day before the FOMC meeting.  But the current situation is similar to the prev ious episodes in that markets arrived at a high degree of certainty about  the outcome several days in advance of the meeting. Still, as shown in the middle left panel,  primary dealers responding to the Desk’s survey have, since last November, evid enced both increased disagreement among themselves (the light blue bars) and greater  uncertainty individua lly (the dark blue bars) about policy actions to be taken at the next meeting two weeks ahead of that meeting.  Presumably these developments reflect a realizatio n that, with policy accommodation essentially removed, policy actions have become less pre-programmed and more depe ndent on the evolving outlook. Regarding your statement today, as indicat ed in the right-hand panel, dealers anticipate language that expresses more conviction that economic growth has moderated, acknowledges the recent elevated inflation readings, expresses concern about inflation risks, and indicates that fu ture policy actions will be dependent on the data. Although dealers exp ect your statement to cite inflation risks, implying a likelihood of further policy firming, slightly less than half see a ny further tightening in this cycle, and all of those anticipate at most ¼ point either today or in September.  As shown by the black line in the bottom left -hand panel, the peaking of rates implied by fed funds futures at just 5.31 percent s uggests that investors see only 1-in-4 odds that you will take another firming step in this cycle.  Indeed, looking further ahead, the black line in the middle panel illustrate s that market participants continue to anticipate policy easing to commence befo re long, and their projected downward trajectory for the federal funds rate steepen ed somewhat over the intermeeting period.  Investors seems to remain surprisingly assure d in these views:  As shown in the right-hand panel, measures of market uncertain ty about policy six and twelve months ahead, the black and the blue lines, respect ively, have crept highe r of late but are quite low by historical standards. Reflecting our own sense of uncertainty about the Committee’s future actions, in the August Bluebook we presented four, rather than the usua l three, alternatives for 2 The materials used by Mr. Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). 77 of 158           Committee consideration, spanning a fairly  wide range of policy approaches:  alternatives A and B, which would keep  the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting but are distinguished by different risk assessments; and alternatives C and D, which would involve a 25 basis point firming today but are similarly differentiated by their risk assessments. A case for holding the federal funds rate unchanged today is summarized in the top left-hand panel of exhi bit 2.  Based on an assumpti on of an unchanged federal funds rate, the staff forecast is for econo mic growth to run slightly below the expansion of the economy’s potential over the next six quarters.  As shown in the top right-hand panel, real GDP growth is proj ected to average about 2¼ percent over the second half of 2006 and 2007, and the unemploym ent rate is forecast to creep up to 5¼ percent. The negative output gap that de velops by the end of next year is small and exerts only very modest restraint on inflation; but the leveling-out of energy prices that was assumed in the staff for ecast has a more noticeable effect, and core PCE inflation in the Greenbook edges down slowly over the forecast period.  Should the Committee find this outlook likely and, in the circumstances, acceptable, it might be inclined to maintain its cu rrent stance at this meeting. The model-based estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate portrayed in the middle left panel present another perspe ctive that might be seen as arguing for holding steady at this meeting. Over the past two years, seventeen consecutive policy actions have brought the real federal funds ra te from a quite low le vel to the middle of the range of estimates of the equilibrium (shown in red).  This configuration might provide some comfort that leaving the st ance of policy unchanged for six weeks is unlikely to turn out to be a serious mistake—that is, unless the Committee is particularly concerned that inflation exp ectations could become unmoored by further bad news on inflation in circumstances in  which policy evidently had gone on hold.   Moreover, some monetary policy rules re ported in the Bluebook suggest holding policy steady at this meeting.  For example, the first-difference rule using an inflation target of 2 percent, which is portrayed to the right, points to only ¼ point of additional policy firming through the end of next year, based on the staff baseline forecast. However, even if the Committee thought that leaving the stance of policy unchanged was appropriate for this mee ting, it might—as noted immediately below the panel—continue to see seve ral sources of upside risks to  inflation:  most notably, high levels of resource utilization, which mi ght be a larger concern now that labor cost pressures look to be great er than previously perceive d; elevated energy and other commodity prices; and the potential for further increases in thos e factors—the latter possibility highlighted by yesterday’s news from Alaska.  In these circumstances, the Committee might see the language of altern ative B, communicati ng a judgment that “some inflation risks remain” and referencing a potential need to address those risks, as appropriate in conjunction with  an unchanged stance of policy.   At the same time, the Committee might perceive emerging downside risks to the economic outlook, as noted in the first bullet in the bottom left-hand panel.  Output 78 of 158         and employment have decelerated substant ially in recent months, and certainly a sharper-than-expected further deceleration cannot be ruled out.  In particular, housing the Bluebook’s outcome-based rule re spond to emerging slack by lowering the federal funds rate to 4¾ percent by the end of next year.  Even without particular concerns about such risks, an outlook  along the lines of the Greenbook baseline forecast might be consistent with alternat ive A if policymakers judge such inflation performance to be satisfactory in light of the below-trend projection for output growth, as in the optimal control policy path with an inflation target of 2 percent.  Moreover, the Committee’s past behavior as captured in the estimated forecast-based rule would, as shown in the bottom right-hand panel, suggest  a slight easing of policy, given the staff outlook. In these circ umstances, the Committee might find it reasonable to leave the stance of policy unc hanged at this meeting and not have any predilection for the likely di rection of policy going forward, as in alternative A. However, as discussed in the top pane l of exhibit 3, even  if the Committee thought that downside risks to growth were  becoming more palpable, it might still wish to firm policy another notch at this  meeting.  If the Committee saw significant potential for inflation to exceed expectati ons, it might believe that another 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate  is necessary to balance the risks.  Alternatively, the Committee might feel, give n the already relatively high level of inflation, that a significant upside surprise  to inflation could be quite damaging and would exceed the cost of a dow nside surprise to growth.  If so, the Committee might be willing to tighten policy a bit further to provide more insurance against persistent high inflation. The Committee might also belie ve that a rate increase today could be a useful signal of its anti-i nflationary resolve while, as under alternative C, suggesting that it was not necessarily expecting to firm policy further. All that said, members may have reserv ations in current circumstances about suggesting that the risks ar e balanced, even after the 25 basis point firming of alternative C. Such reservations may mo tivate the Committee to consider alternative D, discussed in the remainder of your exhibi t.  Under this alternative, the Committee would both raise the federal funds rate 25 basi s points at this meeting and imply that further increases may well be in store.  As  noted in the middle panel, members might be inclined to adopt alternative D for se veral reasons.  First, the Committee might agree that the staff forecast presents th e most likely outcome for the economy and inflation should the federal funds rate be held at its current level over coming quarters, but it may prefer a steeper decline in  inflation than in that forecast and be willing to tolerate a slower pace of econo mic growth to achieve it.  Indeed, as reproduced in the bottom left-hand panel, th e optimal control simulations presented in chart 7 of the Bluebook suggest  that considerable policy firming lies ahead if the Committee wanted to pursue a 1½ percent inflation objective—especially should it seek to attain that rate within a few years.  The Committee also might believe that appreciable further policy firming could be  in prospect because it does not expect 79 of 158                 growth to slow as much as the staff expects or because it is c oncerned that inflation pressures could turn out to be more durable than forecast by the staff, a risk that is illustrated by the “persistent inflation” scen ario.  As shown by the black line in the bottom right-hand panel, if those increm ental inflation pressures were fully anticipated, optimal policy would call fo r boosting the federal funds rate about 75 basis points above baseline over the next year.  In the optima l control case with gradual learning (the dashed red line) or with the empirically estimated rule that reacts only to outcomes (the dashed blue line) the policy respons e is more drawn out but is eventually of similar dimensions.  Should the Committee see a significant risk of persistent inflation pressures along these lines, it may wish to continue to point to upside risks in its announcement if it firms 25 basis points at this meeting, as in alternative D. Your final exhibit is the ve rsion of table 1 that was di stributed on Friday.  Thank you. That concludes my prepared remarks.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  Any questions for Br ian?  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I have one question about the term “resource utilization. ”  It was in our statement last time, and we took it out of many of the alternatives .  I think David mentioned that resource utilization was a bit tighter since our la st meeting.  I was wond ering whether there was a particular reason for taking it out of many of the options that we have to consider here.

MR. MADIGAN.  It is in alternative C, as Pr esident Minehan mentions .  I think it’s simply a question of whether or not the Committee prefers to  speak in those terms, whether it would like to mention that factor at this meeting.  I don’t thin k the staff has a strong vi ew on whether or not it should be included.

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any other questions?  Go vernor Kohn. 80 of 158           

[SECTION]

  MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr . Chairman.  I found th is a challenging meeti ng for arriving at a policy conclusion.  I certainly agree with many of  you that inflation has been running higher than we want for longer than we have wanted, and I actively debated whether we should continue on our tightening path. But in the en d, I think there are a number of advantages to keeping policy unchanged but being very careful to talk about the upsi de risk to inflation that  we see.  One of those advantages is that the staff may actually be right .  [Laughter]  Keeping policy at this rate may be consistent with a moderati on of inflation over coming quarters.  Even if inflation doesn’t moderate quite as fast as some of us mi ght want it to, at least it’s on th e right, downward, track.  In my previous remarks I cited a few things that lead me to  think that that’s a nontri vial possibility.  One is that we have had some evidence th at growth is slowing to at least the growth rate of potential and transitory, as Governor Kroszner said, and will less en over time.  So I thin k that keeping the policy rate where it is could well be consistent with making  progress toward our obje ctives of stable prices and maximum employment over time. Because there’s a strong expectation in the market, not 100 percent but around 80 percent, that we won’t do anything, I th ink that, if we keep policy unch anged but continue to express considerable concern about inflatio n risk, there will be very little market reaction in terms of the expected interest rates further ou t on the curve.  That would impl y to me that fi nancial conditions won’t be loosened by our keep ing policy unchanged.  Talking about inflation risks will also preserve our flexibility for the futu re.  We’ll let the market know what we’re most worried about, and keeping policy uncha nged while talking about inflation risks will give us some of that flexibility, which would be very, very important given th e uncertainties.  Ther e are downside risks to growth as well as th e risk that inflation wi ll remain higher.  Expre ssing the concerns about 81 of 158            inflation but keeping policy unchan ged gets us off what Chairman Bernanke called “the escalator” of 25 basis points a meeting.  The situation is su ch that it would be a go od idea to get off that escalator and have that flexibility without signalin g that we think we’re done but ju st that we’re stopping for today. In terms of the language of the statement, I’ m not sure that alterna tive B fully expresses the concerns that I heard around the table about inflation risk.  Presid ent Moskow raised  one of those issues—that the alternative B langua ge has nothing about hi gh levels of resour ce utilization.  I think high resource utilization is a risk.  One suggestion would be to take the language in alternative C under section 3 and put it in alternative B as pe rhaps a better expression of what the Committee’s concerns are, even while keep ing policy unchanged.  That woul d speak to President Moskow’s point. Another word that was dropped from the announcement was “produ ctivity” as damping inflation.  I think that’s a close call as well.  Productivity growth remains very strong.  The staff has with history.  At the same time , with compensation increasing, la bor costs are not really holding down inflation and aren’t expected to hold it down in  the future.  So I coul d go either way in terms of including a reference to produc tivity.  To me, deletin g it would indicate that the unit labor cost path that we had for holding down inflation, which we cite d last time, isn’t there anymore.  But it is a fact that productivity continues to be strong.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Than k you.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you very much.  In my memory, this is  about the toughest decision I’ve ever been a part of at  this table.  Over the past twelve, thir teen, or so years that I’ve been here, we haven’t faced th e combination of potential fo r slower growth and rising inflation that is certainly 82 of 158            not optimal for a central bank, and I re ally do find this choi ce to be very difficu lt along the lines that Don mentioned earlier.  Not only do we  have to figure out what to do, we have to figure out what to say about it, and that’s another co mplicating factor that has just grown over the years.  We began raising interest rates more than two years and 425 basis points ago, but at some point we have to stop or at least pause.  What makes this particularly  difficult is that price gr owth is on an uptick and moderation occurs only in projec tions and not yet in the data. I think you, Ben, anticipated in one of your earlier testimonie s—perhaps in the first one you gave—that we might have to pause in the midst of adverse incoming price da ta.  The thought wasn’t well received at th e time, as I recall; and now that we’re faced with that decision, I find myself uncomfortable.  The logic is clear.  Inflation data are backward l ooking, and if we  continue to increase rates until incoming information suggests  that moderation ha s occurred, we will undoubtedly overdo the tight ening process.  But knowi ng that doesn’t make choosing when to stop or even to pause easier when you see, as I do, many ri sks that both growth and inflation pressures In that regard, I think Don and I are proba bly just micromeasurements away from each other, but I’m sort of on the other side of the line.  At the margin I favor increasing the federal funds rate 25 basis points.  I be lieve inflation risks are on the upside and that we’re at risk that the current higher rates of inflation will become embedded in business practices and, therefore, get reflected in the market expectations and the expectations that we measure.  I don’t th ink we’re way behind the curve, but I do think we need to en sure that policy stays less rather than more acco mmodative.  As I noted earlier, if one looks at real  interest rates, among other thin gs, financial conditions are more rather than less accommodative th an earlier in the summer, and I personally don’t think that’s consistent with the inflation risks that we face. 83 of 158                 Now, Don pointed out that the market is not an ticipating this.  For some reason or another, the market saw the minutes of  our last meeting as very soft.  I di dn’t read them that  way.  As I recall our discussion at the last meetin g, we wanted to give ourselves some flexibility.  We would be happy if the market saw a 50-50 chance.  Probably re flecting on growth in Q2  that was slower than they expected and on so me of the employment da ta, they’ve obviously tilte d it the other way.  I recognize that surprising the market with an increase would be a su rprise, [laughter]  but I’m not at all sure that’s a bad thing, particularly if we are as concerned about inflat ion around the table as I have heard many of us say. I recognize that I may be in the minority here.  So I would strongly ad vocate that, if we do talk about pausing, we not suggest to the markets that we think the risks in the economy are balanced. We have to signal clearly that our concerns are on the upside with regard to inflation.  If I were a voting member, I’d vote to raise the fed funds rate  25 basis points and to use some form of alternative C, possibly by adjusting the last line to indicate an ongoing co ncern about inflation but probably not going all the way in th e direction of alternative D.  I re cognize that’s no t likely to be the consensus here. So then I wo uld strongly favor alternative B in terms of language, with the change that Don just mentioned—taking section 3 and movi ng it into alternativ e B—to perhaps give a stronger cast to th e overall assessment.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Than k you.  President Yellen. 

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B.  It is  a tough decision.  I personally consider this the wiser course of action,  although I think there’s no question that a case can be made for raising rates today.  Alternative B has several advantages.  First, a pause at this meeting will give us a chance to review incoming  data over the next six weeks, which isn’t that 84 of 158           long. We need a chance  to better ascertain wher e the economy is headed and whether the elevated levels of inflation we ha ve seen are persisting. I think there is significant downside risk to  growth, as I mentioned, with housing being a particularly acute exampl e.  I think our po licies are taking a bite out of economic momentum, and I agree with the analysis that our Chairman gave of at least the downside risk from that source. I am also disturbed by the trajecto ry of core inflation over the first half of the year.  We’ll see two CPI reports and other data by the ne xt meeting, and I think maybe they will help us sort out just how sustained the rise in inflat ion is truly likely to be. As I said, there’s no doubt in my mind that you can make a good case for rais ing rates today, and frankly I probably would have ended up favoring  that myself, despite th e associated risk to growth, if I thought ther e were an imminent dang er of our losing our infl ation-fighting credibility with the markets and the general pu blic.  But that’s not the case at all in my  view.  The markets don’t expect us to raise rates toda y.  Yet inflation expectations are contained.  President Lacker has emphasized, and I agree with  this, that we cannot ta ke our credibility for gran ted.  Economic models that allow for imperfect cr edibility show that, when a central ba nk lacks full cred ibility, it should respond somewhat more aggressively to inflation than would be optimal if it were completely credible, which is President Lacker’s  point.  I agree with that.  But such  models don’t imply that the central bank should act as  if price stability were the sole objective.  In the current context, that suggests to me that our cr edibility is likely to be  preserved as long  as we continue  to respond to economic conditions in a mann er that is basically consistent with  the pattern that the Committee has established over the past decade, which is similar t o, say, a modified version of the Taylor rule.  I think that’s what we’ve been doing and essentially should continue to do. 85 of 158                   An advantage of alternative B, and I think this  is important, is that it does suggest concern with inflation risks.  I completely agree that we should express that concern.   I expect and I hope that inflation is going to edge dow n, but I don’t have a great deal of  confidence in that forecast.  I would not want to see a statement suggesting that inflation risks are balanced at the present time; I think it would be misleading.  Our statement should, in effect, cont ain an asymmetric bias toward tightening, and that’s true whether we actually rais e rates or we don’t raise rates.  So I would oppose alternatives A and C, and I have no  objection to substituting the language from alternative C for that in B as Governor Kohn suggested. I find it hard to predict what  the market reaction is  going to be, but the language could end up raising the market’s expectations  concerning future rates.  I wo uld consider that appropriate in light of the fact that standard policy rules and optimal policies reported in th e Bluebook do suggest that some further increases in the fed funds rate are likely to be called for in coming months.  Our communications should be consistent with that analysis and not indicate that we think we’re probably done. So what’s the advantage of alte rnative B?  We can get off the escalator of 25 basis points per meeting, take a pause, and evalua te incoming data with out saying that we think we’re done with the tightening phase.  I do worry that  a market psychology has developed that suggests that the minute we stop raising rates we’re absolute ly finished.  In contrast to th e Greenbook’s traj ectory, which is that we’re going to stay here fo r a while and not quickl y reverse, markets now apparently anticipate a rather rapid policy reversal. Th e Greenbook assumption is a more sensible position—it would be a more sensible set of market exp ectations than the idea that we will have a quick reversal.  It would not be unwelcome to me at all to see the market trajector y for the future bounce up.

[SECTION]

 MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  With each speaker,  this discussion gets more and more interesting.  I think it’s fair to sa y that anybody who has been involved in the policymaking process for very long has made a spe ech or talked publicly about how you come to the meeting with your ow n views and you’re always willing to listen to you r colleagues and change your mind.  I come probably  as close to that phenomenon today as I have in my ten years at the table. As I listened to the discussion  that we had earlier, I guess I was a bit surprised at how great the concern about inflation is.  I sh are it certainly to a great extent.  I think that on e could, in fact, make a very strong case for a further tightening move today.  It seems to me, however, that a tightening move today would have to come with  an expression of continuing concern about inflation.  That, I think, would imply probably a dditional tightening moves.  If combined with the notion that we’re not satisfied that the path we’re on  will get inflation down we ll within th e range, a tightening move today implies an even greater likelih ood of further tightening.  I think that kind of path raises the probability that we’re going to do too much and stay too long at this.  Not to “me too” your comments, but perhaps because I come from the Southeast, where housing is such an important factor—though I’m not sure I understand completely the slowdown in housing and how important that may turn out  to be—it is certainly a factor in my mi nd.  I’m w illing to gi ve more weight to the optimis tic forecast on infla tion than it sounds as though some are.  I appreciate the pricing power discussion that we’ve heard around the table, but we have been hearing that for years, and I would hope that the same thin gs that kept that from playin g out would contin ue keeping it from playing out. Again, one could, in fact, make a very honorable case for a further tightening move today, but that’s not where I came in, and that’s not wher e I end up after the discussion.  I think in some 87 of 158               ways that’s a harder conclusion to  come to, but I s till favor somethin g like alternative B.  It would be very good for us to demonstrate the willingness to  pause and try to understa nd the things that are going on a little better than we do .  I am willing to trus t, perhaps more than some are, that the forecast inflation is going to work its way down.  I am less obsessed th an some with tr ying to push it all the way down to 1½ percent in  the very short term.  I don’t think that the world would expect and insist that we do that. We have enough credibility that we should use a bit of it now to give ourselves time to see where we are.  If our forecast that  things are going to be  okay turns out to be wrong, we can change our position rather quickly and regain whatever lo ss of credibility somebody thinks we may have incurred.  Again, all things cons idered, I favor no cha nge in policy today and language similar to what’s in alternative B.  I do not intend to dissent today if the consensus is on the side of tightening, but I have a reasonably strong pref erence for using this opportunity to  take a break in the path we’ve been on and to try to understand a bit better where we are.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Plosser. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER.  Gee, wh at can I say?  [Laughter] It’s a very difficult cal l, and indeed, I consider myself really fortunate th at I happen to be in on this di scussion in my first time.  Maybe there are some advantages and disadvantages to th at.  Maybe I don’t carry some of the baggage of what I’ve said in past meetings because I haven’t said anything in past meetings. I certainly understand and respect the view e xpressed by those who think we should pause.  I think that most people ar ound this table recognize that reasonab le people at this stage doing sound economic analysis could come down one  way or the other on this.  But at this point, my inclination is to favor a 25 basis poin t increase.  Economic gr owth has slowed from th e rapid pace that we’ve all been talking ab out.  This was expected .  I see little reason to think,  at least based on what I’ve 88 of 158               heard around the table today, that growth will be considerably below trend in the second half of this year or into ’07. I don’t think that holding rates steady at this time will add much to real  growth in the near term, nor do I think it’s really buying us much  insurance against possible future weakness.  By the same token, I don’t think raising rates 25 basis points is going to have a significant effect on the real economy in the near term either, but it can help reinforc e the public’s percepti on of our commitment to price stability. I believe that the Committee has done an  outstanding job in maintaining credibility thus far, as evidenced by the fact that we’v e all noted that longer-term inflationary expectations seem to be well anch ored.  But longer-term expectati ons remain contained because the not to presume that expectations  will remain stable independen t of our actions today or in subsequent meetings. If the Committee chooses not to raise rates, does it risk se nding the message that we are willing to tolerate inflation above an acceptable leve l for a significant period of  time?  If we take the Greenbook’s forecast as our point forecast, as has be en repeatedly said, it will basically say that we’re prepared to tolerate PCE core  inflation in excess of 2 percent for four years or  perhaps more.  Sending that message may generate  increased uncertainty about our commitment to low inflation; and if inflation expectations b ecome unhinged as a re sult, that would lead to some very bad outcomes given the costs impo sed on the economy as we strive to regain our  credibility.  I recognize that a rate increase may come as a surprise to the markets, but I’m less sure that, over a slightly longer period, it won’t indeed be good news fo r the markets and for the economy as a whole. Thus, as I see it, the argument for favoring another move today is based on a comparison of the potential costs and be nefits.  Pausing is not free.  In my view, paus ing today woul d do little for 89 of 158                    growth in the near term, nor does it help us on our  credibility side.  I believe  the potential costs of tightening a bit more in terms of bad outcomes for growth and employmen t are outweighed by the potential costs of not doing so, gi ven where inflation is and wher e we think it’s going.  If the economy’s growth prospects dete riorate significantly in the comi ng weeks and months, we clearly have the opportunity to pause or even redu ce rates if we think do ing so is necessary. In contrast, I ask myself, “How  difficult will it be , if we pause today, to resume rate increases if we need to do so?”  This question leads to thinking abou t the language of the statement.  If we choose to pause today, it’s important that we send  a clear and very st rong signal with our statement language that we are comm itted to price st ability.  Pointing out that  inflation pressures are likely to moderate over ti me is important if we believe that to be the case because we need to explain why, despite inflation above our comfort zone, we aren’t acting.  Pointing out that some inflation risks remain would help convey the idea that we may need  to act in the future to bring inflation down if our forecasts  turn out to be wrong. So I’d like to close by sugg esting that each of us needs to ask ourselve s the following questions: What informatio n are we likely to see in  the next six weeks that  would cause us, if we pause today, to initia te another rate increase in September?  What might cause us to cut rates in were in the past six weeks, and inflation continues unabated, will we find our selves in the position of inertia that would lead  us to continue pausing and then would possibly put us further behind the curve? Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. As I outlined earlier, my sense is that, after having largely eliminated resource underutilization, the ec onomy is now fluctuating around pot ential.  It’s attractive in 90 of 158         circumstances like this to look back to sim ilar periods for an independent gauge on the appropriate level of real intere st rates.  From 1995 through 2000, another period of sustained real growth around potential, the real federal funds ra te relative to lagged co re PCE inflation ranged between 3¼ percent and 5 percent.   Right now, the real federal funds rate measured the same way is 2.9 percent. This is handily illustrated, by the way, by the black line in the Bluebook’s chart 8. You can do this calcu lation yourself using any number of alternative methods of estimating inflation expectations, and you always get the same result.  The real federal funds rate was never this low between 1995 and 2000. As an aside, a deeper scientific analysis of the appropriate level of the real interest rate would take into account the insight , dating back at least to Irving Fisher, that it ought to reflect the relative balance of pressures on current ve rsus future resources—intertemporal rates of substitution, in other words. Clearly, any gauge of that  is going to relate real rates to current demand relative to the potential for the economy to supply it.  So in any statistical relationship estimated over historical data , one is going to uncover a relationship between real rates and output. A monetary policy maker surely can’t ignore output, and I woul dn’t advocate doing that. One important difference between now and the late 1990s is that inflation was better behaved then. Inflation fell from just over 2 pe rcent in 1995 to just be low 2 percent in 1996, and it stayed in the middle of the 1 to 2 percent range for the rest of that decade.  Now, as many have noted, inflation is going in the oppos ite direction.  Briefly, it has b een above 2 percent since early ’04 and has stepped up signifi cantly since the beginning of the year.  The Greenbook is projecting that it will remain a bove 2¼ percent for a year and a half.  It now appears as if an acceleration of wage inflati on has begun.  Although one might characterize—as many around the 91 of 158        table have—inflation expectations  as “well contained,” I think it’s worth questioning whether the level at which expectation measures are contained is that reassuring. I’ll note that the TIPS inflation compensation figures taken from last Friday afternoon show that, adjusted for the carry  effect, the ten-year spread is  2.65, the five-year spread five years ahead is 2.7, and the one-year forward rate ending in ten year s is 2.89.  Adjusting that to get back to core PCE, the first thing you do is take  overall to core; the exp ected value of that is surely around zero going forward. Then, there’s this CPI-to-PCE measur ement error.  If you chart that, you see it has fluctuated  a lot.  Sure, the historical av erage is 0.3 percentage point, but it has been negative for several qua rters, and just now it has gotten back to 0.2 or 0.3 or so.  So let’s take 0.4, the Bluebook’s adjustment.  If yo u expected long-run infl ation expectations to accord with the opinion of some around this table—that they would like to see inflation within a comfort zone between 1 and 2 percent—you’d expect core infl ation of 1.5 percent, and you’d expect these inflation expectation measures to be 1.9 percent.  If you look at the survey evidence, they are at 2.5, 2.9, and 3.2 percent.   So it’s not clear that infl ation compensation and inflation expectation measures are contained in a way that ’s consistent with a long-run inflation objective around 1.5 percent. In short, if you sum up all th e inflation evidence, take the whole picture together, to my mind it looks a lot as though infla tion has become entrenched above 2 percent.  In my view, the longer we let it go on, as a previous Chairman a nd this Chairman have said, the more difficult it will be to correct it. The worse inflation outlook now indicates that, if anything, the real short rate should be higher than otherwise warranted by r eal growth considerations.  On t op of that, there is the Fisher relationship to take into account, as President Moskow pointed out .  Since the June meeting, the 92 of 158         Greenbook’s one-year-ahead inflatio n forecast has risen 45 basis points, so a 5¼ percent fed funds rate now corresponds to a 45 basis point  lower real rate than it did in June. As I said earlier, I think a fair scientific appraisal of  the evidence should make us deeply skeptical of the notion that moderating growth is going to bri ng core inflation down without further action on our part to bette r anchor inflation e xpectations.  Yet a po pular perception now is that this hypothesis is the centerpiece of our in flation strategy.  I believe we need to take action today to correct th at misapprehension. I do not believe we live in a world in wh ich it is common knowle dge that we follow a fixed policy reaction function that includes among its arguments or determinants a single number capturing a well-known long-run inflation objective for us—for example, the Taylor rule that has a single number, π*, that captures where inflation return s and to which any impulse response function you run is going to return  in five or ten years.  I be lieve, rather, that our recent experience clearly demonstrates th at there have been substantial swings in the public’s beliefs about future inflation and moneta ry policy—in other words, about what kind of policymakers we are. Moreover, I believe that the public is confused about how monetary policy and inflation should respond to energy-price shocks. I think this  confusion arose in the wake of Katrina, and I think it has been exacerbated by our failure to ex plain that fact well enou gh to the public, even though we have all tried. More energy shocks are likely in the years ahead, and we need to condition markets to expect us to protect core inflation in response rather than attempt to protect the unemployment rate as we did in the 1970s. I think the first-order policy problem for us  today is to influence the evolution of the public’s beliefs in a way that helps bring infl ation down more rapidly than the public and the Greenbook are currently forecasting, rather than rely ing on subsiding special factors.  In theory, 93 of 158          a forceful enough communication about our intentions to act in the future could be an effective substitute for action today, but I am skeptical abou t this hypothesis as well .  We have been quite careful to say that, if we pause,  we could resume rates shortly th ereafter.  But every time we say that, the market reaction seems to  be, “Did you say ‘pause’?”  This  has the market focused on the possibility of our pausing and less focused on the possibility of our resu ming afterward, and that is clearly reflected in what the yield curve has do ne since the last meeting, as illustrated in the Bluebook. In sum, I acknowledge the case for below-potenti al growth over the next few quarters, as low as the staff believes. If I expected signi ficantly lower growth than I do, I would obviously favor a lower real interest rate path than I otherwise would.  But I think that the risk that the housing contraction will have broader multiplie r effects on personal consumption and other sectors is still relatively small, and I do not th ink we should be satisfie d with the path that inflation is likely to take if  we stay on the policy path that the market anticipates.  Communication is important, as we ’ll discuss later toda y, but there are times when actions speak louder than words. Therefore I favor a 25 basis point increase in the fe deral funds rate and a statement something like alternative D, a nd I favor them enough to vote accordingly. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Th ank you.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you. Well, like others, I have asked myself whether this is the appropriate time to pause.  I think there are respectable and reasonable arguments on both sides of that question, and so let me briefly make a couple of them. In favor of the pause now is the observati on, which I would reiterate, that I do believe inflation expectations are well anchored and have  remained well anchored despite developments that we might have expected to have con cerned people in the marketplace, namely higher 94 of 158        inflation numbers in reality and an apparent growing conviction among many market participants that a pause in our policy tighten ing actions is likely to be fo rthcoming.  The second argument concerns the well-known lags betw een our policy actions and their effects.  I wish I knew more about those lags, to be precise, th an I do, but it still seems to me it ’s a good bet that we have not seen the full effects of the actions we have alr eady taken.  The third argu ment is that market participants are expecting a pause at  this point, or at least many are. On the other hand, inflation has been more rapi d so far this year than I had expected, and it is probably not a good bet that it will decelerate anytime soon.  This persistence of inflation could have deleterious consequences for in flation expectations unless we communicate particularly effectively going fo rward, if we do pause.  With hi ndsight, looking at the course of policy over the past three or four years, I think that it’s at least possi ble that policy was too accommodative for too long; thus, we have more work to do to counteract those effects. When I weigh those arguments and think about some of the other arguments I have heard around the table, I come down in favor of a pause at this meeting and in favor of something like alternative B. It’s very impor tant that we avoid giving the impression that we may be done, and I think alternative B largely does that.  I am reluctant to wade into the morass of editing on the run; but if we wanted to strength en that alternative, I think we could actually do it with one word in section 3, third line, by just saying “owing only in part to the pass-through.” The thought I have is that the “only” signals that we’re not simply suggesting this is all transitory  and all due to special factors. But that’s just a suggestion.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Th ank you.  President Poole. 95 of 158          

[SECTION]

 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As others are, I am very torn about this our situation. Part of it is the language that we used in the past. If you look at the first exhibit that we we re given, you see that the fed funds rate responded to the second-quarter GDP report and the employment report.  We have told the utilization matters to us.  It s eems to me that the lesson from that is, first, we should come through with what we told the market we were going to do and, second, we should get some of those things out of the statement because we need to put a lot more emphasis on the inflation risk that we face going forward. I am particularly unhappy, quite frankly, with leaving the reference to housing in there. Housing is likely to contin ue to have some weak numbers, and it seems to me that we don’t want the market to believe that policy is really being driv en by one sector of the economy.  I offered some language for section 2.  I think that is a statement about the past—“has moderated from its quite strong pace.”  If you ju st look at the second-qua rter GDP report, there was moderation pretty much across the board.  Th at was the language I suggested.  I think we ought not to be referri ng to housing explicitly. We should try to move toward a bare bones st atement and not create expectations in the of the things that is peculiar abou t having that in the statement at th is point is that the staff is not forecasting any significant gap in  resource utilizati on that would put downward pressure on inflation. So how can we be referring to resour ce utilization as our primary reason for thinking 96 of 158           that inflation is going to moderate?  It seems to  me that there is some internal inconsistency there. The problem that I have with alternative B, as it is now worded, is this:  If we believe that we will want to increase the target funds rate at our next meeting—which I think is the interpretation of that last section—then we s hould do it today.  We shouldn’t signal it for the future. Given that expectations seem to be well contained, I thi nk that we have a chance to use our language to get out from under some of the e xpectations we have crea ted and that we should come through on the expectations we  have already created.  You s ee that clearly in the way the data dependent, and I think we’d better come through and be data dependent.   I want to say one other thing about housing. I think that housing may be telling us that it is really a good measure of c onsumer confidence.  Housing obviously involves people looking forward and deciding what commitments they’re willing to make.  I would interpret housing as being a combination measure of people’s attitudes toward the future, the security of their income flows, and the commitments they’re willing to make—to include obviously not only the households themselves but also the lenders that are responsible for maki ng mortgage decisions.  So I would downplay housing as a dire ct component of GDP.  Thank you.

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairm an?  May I ask Mr. Poole a clarifying question? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Certainly. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. So, Bill, you would want to do what to expectations?  How would you want expectations to evolve in response to yo ur preferred version of the language associated with a pause today?  Do  you want them to be flat going forward? 97 of 158        

[SECTION]

 MR. POOLE. Well, in terms of what  we know today, I think we ought to be noncommittal.  If we continue to get informati on that leads to extending the inflation risk or to that, and we ought to leave ourselves open to be responding to that .  We shouldn’t write ourselves into a box by focusing on resource utili zation because those numbers are in many ways the most visible ones to lots of people.  Suppose we get another low number on the August employment report, and we have pointed to resource utilization as  one of the things that we’re counting on?  Are we then writi ng ourselves into a box in terms of  the expectations we create by emphasizing resource utilization?  So that’s why I’m arguing for a very, very general and rather vague statement. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Li ke others, I think the policy action at this meeting is a very close call, but in the end I support a pause, even in  light of the continuing unfavorable inflation situation. I think that there is a real possibi lity that slack could be greater during this projection period than  the staff’s baseline projections expect because of weaker demand, stronger potential, or some combination of  the two.  I am encouraged that inflation expectations remain anchored.  In light of all of the uncertainties attach ed to the current outlook, I would just like to take a pause and see how things play out.  Now, as many have said, there is a chance that the data are going to reveal that this is not a good stopping point.  If the data do reveal that more rate hikes are in order becau se inflation may reaccele rate, because inflation expectations begin to increase, or because econo mic activity appears to be more robust than our current projections, then I think we will need to consider the possibility of a more aggressive move. Unfortunately, I think it’s  unrealistic to expect that some of these issues are going to be 98 of 158           resolved in one or two future meetings.  But we have market-based measures of inflation expectations that are available to us on a contin uous basis, and for that reason, it seems important to me to be especially focused on infl ation expectations in the coming months. I favor alternative B. I support Governor Kohn’s suggestion that we move language from alternative C, section 3, to emphasize our concern about the inflati on risks.  I also want to add that, like President Guynn, I am not  going to dissent if the consensus is for a move of 25 basis points. I came into the meeting leaning toward a pause.  I have to say, after listening to many of my colleagues’ statements today, that inclination is less pronounced.  It’s just a very close call today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I don ’t think I’ll surprise  you.  I agree with Governor Kohn that a pause is appropriate. In te rms of some of the comments, I do suggest that we need to recognize that we often say that monetary policy operates with a lag.  In fact, moves that we have made have not yet worked th eir way through, and we ought to see how they develop. A pause is appropriate to do that—it’s not shutting off further m oves but letting us look at the facts that are in play. With that, I am bothered that the markets are already projecting that, sometime in the future, we will reverse and begin to lower rates,  which I think is not something I would like to see. Also, because I recognize that there are genu ine and serious inflation risks, we need to be— and to express that we are—very sensitive in watching inflation expectations.  Part of our judgment will be not just on real economic data but on these expectations and on what inflation does, since that is our business.  If I could say something in this language, it would be to the 99 of 158           effect that I think we are restri ctive, maybe moderately restrictiv e, and that we’re going to stay that way until we see systematic declines in inflation.  I think that would do a lot for us. Having said that, in terms of the lang uage, I would then be comfortable with alternative B, with the modifications that Governor Kohn has suggested, as we try to clarify our intentions, if that’s what we want to  do with this statement, moving forward. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, I think it was in  March that I referred to Pascal’s famous wager about the existence of God. Pascal’s view  was basically that if you look far out in the future from a risk-management standpoint, the answ er was in the affirmative.  [Laughter] I happen to accept the existence of  inflation, and I admire Presid ent Lacker, President Minehan, and others who have made very strong arguments.  I take note of one thing that is very different  at this meeting from what I have heard in my year-plus at this table.  This is the first tim e that many people have sa id—and I certainly have heard this from the people I have talked to in th e field—that they are moving on prices instead of being tamped down in terms of th eir desire.  In other words, th ey have pricing power, and it is being realized. This is the first time we’ve heard that in the discussion, and it worries me. It’s very, very important that we signal our anti-inflationary resolve.  I generally always agree with President Poole.  I happen to be a minimalist as far as the statement is concerned.  But if we pause here, it is very important that we use the kind of language that Governor Kohn suggested and that we make it very clear that this may not be the end of the process.  Even more important, Mr. Chairman, is that we agree at this table that we’ll be fearless in moving if we have to. 100 of 158         As to the market, I think President Mineha n made a very good comment.  Having been a So I would accept a pause, Mr. Chairman, unde r the conditions I just mentioned.  I like Governor Kohn’s suggestion on language altho ugh, like a broken record, I would put the word “global” in front of “resource utilization” because  I think that reflects real ity.  Having said what I just said, I would also say that, if the group decides to raise th e rate 25 basis points, I won’t dissent because I don’t have a vote. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Excelle nt reason.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The incoming data have heightened my concerns about inflation. I th ink it’s true, as a number of people have mentioned around the table, that inflation expectati ons have not moved up.  The markets seem pretty confident that we’re going to be successful in fighting inflation.  But as Kevin Warsh said, the markets can be pretty fickle. We’re going to get some further bad news on inflation in the coming months, and I hope the markets will maintain their confidence in the Federal Reserve.  Bu t their confidence in us could change as the news continues to be bad in the coming months.  Also, I think we have to ask whether our failure for two years now to keep inflation inside what ma ny of us have said is our comfort zone—1 to 2 percent—is going to weigh eventually on the assessment of the in us may begin to waver if we don’t express our readiness to tighten if inflation doesn’t head down soon. It’s not clear to me that we’ve put restrictive-enough financial conditions in place to put inflation on much of a downward path.  A ccording to the Bluebook, the fed funds rate is close to neutral. In the Bluebook’s longer-run simulation, the optimum policy requires further 101 of 158           rate increases to put us on the path to 1½ percen t.  We won’t get there ju st staying where we are now. I realize it’s a very close call, and everyone has mentioned that; but on balance, I would prefer to raise rates 25 basis point s at this meeting.  I won’t repeat all the comments that Cathy, Charlie, and Jeff made.  I think they were very persuasive.  It woul d surprise the markets, but we shouldn’t be doing what the market s expect us to do.  We shoul d be doing, as someone said, what’s right for the economy and for the American people.  It doesn’t app ear that an increase will be the consensus coming out of this meeting.  I’d just add that, if we do pause, it’s not going to be easy for us to start again.  I don’t think we should kid ours elves about that.  We’re going to be accused of whipsawing by the markets, and we’ll take a lot of criticism.  So we’re going to have to take a very tough stand if  we decide to raise rates again.  It’s not going to be easy, and we should just be prepared to do that. Looking ah ead, I’d say that if we determine that factors are not reducing growth too much and if inflation does not appear to be moderating, then we’re going to need to increase rates further to coax infl ation back toward price stability.  We have to make it clear in our public statements  that we’re prepared to do that. If we do go with the pause, then I certain ly agree with Don Kohn’s recommendation that we should use the language from section 3 of alternative C and move it to section 2 of alternative B.  To omit the reference to high leve ls of resource utilizatio n, when we’ve had it in our past statements, would be a serious error. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Bies. MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We ll, I’m like everybody else around the table— I have found the decision about which way to go to be a very tough call.  I’m coming down on the side of a pause right now, pa rtly because I’m more pessimistic  than the staff forecast on the 102 of 158          second-order effects of the slowdown in housing.   We’re hearing from some bankers that subprime borrowers especially are having more diffi culties and that delinquencies in that sector are going up. Although I don’t see a prolonged problem, as housing slows, the effects are going to bleed into other sectors, and whether into home furnishings or other things, I think there will be wider implications.  I also think the optimis m about the housing sector  is so important to people because it’s a big chunk of their net worth.   So I’m just not as positive about the outlook here. Another concern I have is what is really  happening with the disruption of oil supply around the world. I think that situ ation is potentially more disruptive.  We don’t put political things in our forecasts. A good friend in the o il industry is very concerned, aside from the political risk, about the operating risk in the industry right now, as  I mentioned awhile ago.  So I think there is enough uncertainty ou t there that I’m on the edge, a nd it’s that uncertainty that leads me to say, “Let’s take time out and pause.” I like Governor Kohn’s suggestion for the change in alternative B.  It’s important that we signal resource utilization.  It’s al so important to signal that this  is a pause and not a permanent stop because, when you look at the futures curve, it’s as though the market figures that once we stop we’re going to stop forever. It’s also important that we signal that we are pausing to see what the lagged effects will be. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh. MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  From a capital markets pers pective, as I think about this decision, what matters more than the pricing of this issuance —that is, the decision on 25 basis points—is really what the after-market effects are.  How is this security going to trade over the next weeks and months?  When I think a bout the decision in that  context, it puts the 103 of 158          burden on the communications, whic h are only in small part in the message of our statement today. At the end of the day, I am willing to agre e to a pause.  But, ag ain, I think that puts the burden on laying the predicate that we are in fact poised and prepared to act as necessary.  That begins with our statement, but it  doesn’t end there.  Given the da ta that are likely to come in between this meeti ng and the next (a couple of CPIs, a c ouple of PPIs, maybe a revised PCE) and what’s likely to happen to some of the forward-looking market indicators (TIPS spreads, some of the commodity prices), I think it is very importa nt that the markets understand, before the trading in the security gets very significant, the depth of  our thinking on the subject and of the discussion around this meeting.  The minutes can be part of  that communication.  Such communication is important so that they don’t percei ve us when we meet next to be  reacting to one or two pieces of data, the way they seem to have overreacted to on e or two pieces of data last week, but really recognize the depth of our thinking on this subject. To be consistent with that view, I thin k Governor Kohn’s suggestion of indicating a pause as powerfully as we can is critical. The markets, in the first da ys, are going to take our pause to be a stop, as reflected currently in the Eurodollar futures contracts and the fed fund futures contracts. But we need to disabuse them of that view as quickl y, as frequently, and as consistently as we can so that the pause does not  become read as a stop.  We will then have set out the conditions for the ways in which we might r eact if different data aris e.  Again, I think that the decision today is not an easy one .  It’s important that the mark ets recognize that it is unlikely that our work here is done. With all that said, I’m prepared to support Governor Kohn’s suggestion. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kroszner. 104 of 158       

[SECTION]

 MR. KROSZNER. As I said before, obviously this is an extremely difficult decision, and I agree with many people around the table who have said that very respectable arguments could be made on both sides.  So I would say that, on ne t, there are some advantages to keeping policy unchanged but communicating very, very st rongly our wariness about inflation. I think there is value in pausing to see wh at is going to happen with growth.  Around the table, we certainly expressed di fferent views about what is happe ning to growth.  We know that we’re likely to continue gett ing somewhat unfavorable numbers on inflation, but I think the unwelcome and not particularly favorable on infla tion, but we haven’t seen inflation expectations become unanchored.  Also, we’ve been seeing that  the markets have apparently been assuming that we are not going to move now and that we’re not going to move in the future, if you look to the fed funds futures markets; but that assumption hasn’t manifested itself in any increase in the short-term or longer-term  inflation prospects. That’s very heartening to me.  If that were n’t the case, I would not feel comfortable in moving toward supporting a pause because, as many of us have discussed, the expectational context and credibility are very important.  Cred ibility is an easy thing to lose and a difficult thing to recapture, but I don’t think having a pause now would lead  us to lose credibility.  I think also that it’s important that we see a pause as not being just until the next meeting but as possibly going over multiple meetings because a lot of inform ation, particularly with respect to inflation, will come out over time.  I expressed my view that we may be seeing some transitory effects on inflation that are due primarily to shelter services.  Within two or three meetings we’ll have a better feeling for whether or not those effects are likely to be tr ansitory, and I think keeping our powder dry is very valuable. 105 of 158         We’ve been emphasizing not just that we ar e data dependent but that we are forecast dependent. What do the data say about what is likely to happen in  the future?  Saying that we are forecast dependent helps to underscore that, even though the current data or the recent backward-looking data are not favor able, we are looking to the futu re to what the evolution of inflation and growth is likely to be—exactly what  the last line of alte rnative B emphasizes.  I think, one, it’s what we should be doing and, two, it’s important for people to see that.  So I would favor going with alternative B or having the language in alte rnative C.  I’m not sure the alternative C language adds all that  much more, given the fairly strong statement that we have in the assessment of risks, because I think that is likely to l ead to a somewhat changed expected feds funds futures curve—to leave some probability that we may move and th at this is not a stop.  Certainly, if our pausing is inte rpreted as a stop, we need to pu rsue a communication strategy to convey that it is not a stop and that a pause doe s not mean just one meeting but possibly multiple meetings as we are gathering more information, part icularly about the trans itory versus persistent effects of inflation, and are keeping a very careful eye on the effect of both short-term and long-run inflation expectations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman Geithner. VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We could obviously justify moving today, but we don’t need to m ove today.  We don’t need to move today principally because we have an economy that has already slowed to what we think is trend and because we have inflation expectations at the long horizon staying relatively stable despite adverse inflation news and a fair amount of uncerta inty about the path of inflation going forward.  That has happened, as many of you have said, in  the context of substantial downward revisions 106 of 158         of the expected terminal fed funds rate.  That’s a bit of an experiment in credibility.  We don’t want to take too much reassuranc e from that, but it’s positive.  I think we have to signal that inflation re mains the predominant risk and that we may have more tightening to do.  We have to make it cl ear that, if expectations  deteriorate or if our forecast for inflation changes materially, we are pr epared to tighten further.  Many of the prisms we look through to judge the appr opriate path of policy going forward suggest we may have more to do. They don’t tell us with any certainty th at we have a lot more to do; they suggest that we may have more to do.  If you choose the 1.5 percent target for core PCE and take out the inertial preference in the optimal policy rules, the case for going significantly above 5.25 on the funds rate is pretty strong. We need to look for the combination of acti on and message in the statement that gives us the most flexibility going forward.  It’s hard to know with confidence what that combination is.  My own view is that, if we don’t move today but we have a strong statement about the asymmetry around the risks, we pres erve the possibility of tighteni ng further.  If we move today and the world unfolds as we expect, I think in so me ways it’s harder at the margin to tighten further. But none of us knows that with tota l confidence because we don’t know how the market is going to interpret the statement. Credibility is a very complicated thing.  If we look as though we’re moving out of fear that we’ve lost it, you could say that might be more dama ging to perceptions about our credibility. You can think about the dominant  option on the table as a pause coming from a position of strength and confiden ce and a move in these circumstances coming from a position of greater tentativeness and weakne ss.  I don’t think that would be  desirable—it is something we should try to avoid. 107 of 158         Looking at market expectations today, I see th ree things that make me uneasy.  One is the high degree of confidence that we ’re pretty close to being done.  The second is the inversion— the speed with which they have us removing a bunc h of policy tightening ah ead.  The third is the degree of certainty or confidence in  the path for interest rates.  I don’t know why they have that degree of confidence and certainty ; [laughter] I don’t think we have it.  It’s hard to know, however, how to get us out of that mix.  I thi nk that, as several of you have suggested, it would be nice if we made the market a little less conf ident that we’re going to be taking out the last move or two of tightening pretty quick ly.  How to do that is difficult. Alternative B, as modified by Don Kohn, co mes the closest to doing so.  I would also favor a second suggestion, which is putting back in the reference to ongoing productivity gains, for the following reason. We revised down our estim ate of structural pro ductivity growth a bit, and that’s a material change in our view about productivity.  But the basic forecast, as we best judge it, is still a pretty good one for producti vity growth.  We don’t want to look as though we’ve lost conviction about that  basic positive outlook for productivity growth.  Its omission would be very conspicuous, and I don’t think we’v e learned enough to justify the risk of creating the signal that we’ve lost confidence that we’re going to ha ve productivity growing in the vicinity of 2, 2½, 2¼ percent.  For those reasons, I’d favor  putting that back in.   Just to summarize, I’m reasonably comforta ble not moving today, but  I think we should send a strong signal that the risk s are still predominantly to the upside on inflation.  I also think that alternative B, as modified by Don, does the best job of communicating that message. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you very muc h.  First of all, I’d like to thank everyone for a really helpful and thoughtful discussi on.  It was very useful.  Let me just make a few comments. 108 of 158          First, we do need to be careful to think about what the optimal policy looks like.  It doesn’t take the form that we keep raising rates until we’re happy with the inflation rate.  Instead, what we need to look for is the rate that, if maintained, will ultimately give us a good trajectory in the economy.  I would submit that  we don’t really know where that is yet. President Lacker made some very interesting arguments about the real rate of interest in the late ’90s. Those are good arguments, but I would reply to him, first, that we’ve seen very low real rates in the past decade, a global savings glut and all of that, and, second, we have at the moment an IS shock of very significant and unknown size—the housing market, which is that’s, in fact, a more likely outcome.  But we really can’t be sure at this point where we ultimately want to stop, and we need to be a bit ca utious and try to learn about exactly where that level is going to be. For those reasons, I’m not  comfortable with alternatives A or C because they basically say that we’re done, either at  5.25 or 5.50, and so the choices then are between alternative B and alternative D.   I’m concerned with alternative D because,  besides raising the rate to 5.50, it signals further increases. After seventeen consecutive  moves, we would be tightening into a housing Signaling a strong concern about inflation but being more cautious  in groping for the optimal level of the interest rate is probably a wiser course.  I remi nd you that the Fed has not been terribly successful with soft landings. We have a chance to get one.  All else being equal, I think it would be good if we could achieve that. So I’d recommend alternative B.  I’ll come back to the language in  just a moment.  I characterize this as a hawkish paus e.  I think it has several advantages:  The first is to gather 109 of 158      information.  With respect to some of the points President Poole ra ised, I think the key information we want to look at is, first, activ ity; we want to look at  employment, housing, and consumption, in particular, which will give us some indications about growth going forward.  But we also want to look at infl ation data and inflation expectati ons data.  Inflation expectations, specifically, are mentioned in the statement, and an untethering of inflation expectations would be, on its own, grounds for us to respond.  The risk of our falling behind the curve by pausing is relatively small.  Again, I think that we’re not  more than a couple of moves away from the optimal level.  Therefore, if we miss a meeti ng or two and then move again in November or Moreover, we have a degree of freedom on the other end, so to speak.  If the markets expect us to begin to cut, we can always maintain the rate at the level fo r a longer period than expected to get some further restriction.  So on the substanc e I think there are grounds , after seventeen moves and with the housing market in an indeterminate situation, to pause and to get more information. I’d like to say a word about the tactics as well.  President Mineha n was correct that my introduction of the idea of a pause was not particul arly well received.  But we have now, at least reading the commentary, explained the difference between a pause a nd a stop.  It’s useful for us to get the flexibility that will a llow us not necessarily to move at every meeting but to move as the data require. A demonstration of that flex ibility has some value in terms of creating some more optionality for us in the future. Also, we  have been talking about data dependence.  By creating this flexibility, we’ll be able to increas e the relationship between what we do and what the data say, and I think that’s already worki ng.  For example, I would note the wide dispersion of views among the dealers about where we’re ev entually going to stop.  That dispersion of views comes from differences about where they th ink the economy and inflation are going.  It is 110 of 158             very encouraging to me that they are now not  looking to us for forward guidance but rather looking at the state of the economy and trying to judge where the Fe d will have to go to achieve its objectives. So recognizing the concerns that have been raised and taking them very seriously, I think that our best option, of perhaps not very many great options , is a hawkish pause, which I associate with alternative B. With respect to the language, I think it is an improvement to take at least the first sentence of section 3 in altern ative C, which includes high resour ce utilization, and use it in place of the first sentence of section 3 in alternative B.  I have two que stions for the group.  One, do we want to reintroduce or go back to our old language  of including productivity gains?  If so, that would require the second sentence of alternative A, section 3.  If not, we just use the whole section 3 of alternative C. That’s question on e.  Two, President Poole has expressed concern about the housing reference. We could simply say “reflecting the lagged effects” and leave out the housing part. I would take suggestions on that. I would note that we have used this housing phrase in the past few mee tings, and so it would be a change.  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. The unit labor cost figures s uggest leaving productivity gains out of this.  That’s just my opinion. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay. Ot her comments?  President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. If we were to keep produc tivity gains in, I would suggest striking the word “ongoing.” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any others? 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. May I say something on the mention of housing? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Certainly. 111 of 158          

[SECTION]

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. I think Bill’s  reservations about it are right.  Of course, they would have applied the last time we used it, too. I guess I would argue for keeping housing in on the grounds that it’s happening. It  is the principal area in which we see some weakness going on in the economy, and not to make reference to that reality seems a little awkward. It would be like having a statement that didn’t men tion what’s happening in either energy prices or housing, and that would be hard to justify.  So I would keep it, on the simple grounds that it is happening and it’s an accurate description of reality.  I don’t think it’s a problem. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Poole. MR. POOLE. Section 2 can reasonably be interpreted as referri ng to second-quarter GDP. That’s the news that we have, and there has been a slowing in a wide range of sectors.  So I think that that’s a sensible  interpretation.  There are continuing concerns about housing going forward. I understand that. But it seems to me that  section 2 is really a statement about what has already happened in the economy— that’s the essential element of  it—and housing is just not the biggest thing that has happened. I would also agree with Jeff that we should keep productivity out because people logically say, “Well, unit labor costs are what are really important here,” and we don’t have a great story to  tell on unit labor costs. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kroszner. MR. KROSZNER. I think it would be odd to take out the referen ce to housing, given that we have mentioned it a number of times in the past.  The rationale clearly says that it’s “partly reflecting” and then gives a number of factors.  It is not saying that  those factors are the only ones. Also, I don’t interpret this language as being simply about what happened in the past; “has moderated” is also talking about where we ar e—that growth is not as strong as it was.  I see 112 of 158             that language as having a forwar d-looking aspect to it.  I thin k it would be very odd to take housing out, partly because it’s factually accurate, even if you take the historical view, and partly because, given our discussions around the table, we  are concerned about “gradual cooling.”  It is appropriate to leave the reference in. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  I agree with Randy on this. It would be very st range to take housing out now because it was in last time and because it  is so important to the future of the economy.  The productivity question is a close call. On ba lance, I’d leave it out b ecause it does raise the whole question about unit labor costs.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any other views?  President Plosser. MR. PLOSSER. I’m new to these language nuances about housing.  It occurs to me, however, that one question you ought to ask is whether by including housing or continuing to include housing the Committee is putting itself in a position where it can’t raise rates until housing comes back.  Are we unfai rly locking ourselves in, or at  least are the markets going to interpret it that way?  That’s ju st another question to think about in deciding how to include it.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I think that President Plosser has a good point there and President Poole did as well. Section 2 is aimed at explai ning what has happened with growth in the past.  Everything moderated. To me, the most surprising thing was how slow business fixed investment was.  It was not so surprising that housing was slow because we expected housing to be slow, so I think you could easily take housing out  of there.  You have the lagged effects of increases in interest rates, whic h affect housing as well as a whole range of other things.  I also think that Charlie has a good point.  We don’t want to hang our action on one piece of data 113 of 158              versus another piece of data going forward. I’m agnostic about productivity, to tell you the truth.  I think the unit labor cost numbers are not good news—we have some problems there—and to hang it out as a saving factor again and agai n may not be what we want to do. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All righ t.  I think we need to come to resolution.  Oh, sorry. Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES. I would prefer to leave housi ng in because housing resources aren’t readily substitutable for other parts of the economy.  If we leave resource utiliza tion in, we’re sort of acknowledging that, although housing is soft, there ar e still resource pressures in other parts of the economy.  I think the picture is better balanced that way. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Thank you.  Let me just say that I think this language is purely descriptive. I don’t think it’s conditioning our action on anything having to do with housing. I don’t think the market will tie our move to hous ing.  Let’s just take a straw vote. How many would like to keep the statemen t as it is with housing included?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleve n.  Okay. I think that’s a majority.  So we’ll leave section 2 as it is.  Is there any sentiment for going back  to alternative A, section 3, second sentence, which includes ongoing productivity gain s?  Are any of you in favor of that? [Laughter] All right. The statement, then, will  be exactly alternative B, except that the third section of alternative C will be substituted for the third section of alternative B.  Would you please call the roll? 

[SECTION]

MS. SMITH. Yes. The directive would be , “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability  and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives , the Committee in the immediate future seeks 114 of 158             conditions in reserve markets consistent with main taining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5¼ percent.” Then the risk assessment is, “Nonetheless, th e Committee judges that some inflation risks remain.  The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evoluti on of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information.” Chairman Bernanke          Yes Vice Chairman Geithner       Yes Governor Bies Yes President Guynn Yes Governor Kohn Yes Governor Kroszner Yes President Lacker No President Pianalto Yes Governor Warsh Yes President Yellen Yes

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Best of luck. Our afternoon session is on communications. I’d like to turn it ov er to Governor Kohn.         

[SECTION]

 MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We are in a hurry, and I don’t have anything really in the way of introduction. I just want to say that we sent a list of questions, but we didn’t expect answers to every question. We hope that the questions helped to  spark thinking about some of the broad issues rela ted to communications—what we’re  trying to do and the broad strategy of how we should go about it. I remind you that, as the memo says, this is an initial discussion. Time is limited, so we ’d prefer not to get into the details of va rious proposals but to think about broad issues  of strategy and goals. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. We’re just  going to have a go-round.  Please raise your hand, and Brian will take your name.   

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. If no one wants to start, [laughter ] I can start.  I actually have just a couple of things to say. We need to keep in mind that communication is not an end in and of itself.  It’s a means to an end.  Where we rank on some profe ssor’s table of transparency isn’t really what it’s about. It’s about meeti ng our legislative objectives fo r stable prices and maximum employment.  As we think about our communication, we ought to  concentrate on that—what our goals and objectives are and where inflation and activity are going relative  to those objectives, given the shocks and dynamics of the economy, and the broad policy outlines for strategy to foster those objectives. If we do that well, we ’ll help achieve those obj ectives, both by building public understanding of, confidence in, and support for a politically independent central bank and by giving private agents, in financial markets and in labor and product markets, information that should help them act in ways that will promote achieving our goals.   I think we’ve done a good job of this. Certainly, this institution for the past twenty-five years has been pretty darn successful at achieving our congressional mandates, and our communication has contributed to that. At leas t around the edges it certain ly has helped, in both 116 of 158         the political and the economic dimensions.  So I don’t think we have a communication strategy that’s seriously broken, that need s radical surgery.  But I do think it has grown in an ad hoc way, This is a good time to step back and see how th ings are fitting together—whether we can tailor some things to some audiences and other things to other audiences that we want to attract and whether anything is missing from the strategy. The discussion this morning reinforced my vi ew that we do need to  talk about goals and about whether we should be numer ically defining price stabilit y.  There’s a presumption around the table that we have already done this to a certain extent, but we haven’t as a committee.  We’re in a kind of untenable position right now in which the outside world doesn’t know how we look at our objectives and how we would act. So we need to have that discussion, and I’m glad that we’ve scheduled it for the first part of the discussi on in October.   How the economy is doing relative to our goals, objectives, and strategy does require forward-looking language. We tried to indicate in  this memo that the forward-looking language has pitfalls that we need to keep in mind as we go forward.  What we know is limited.  That certainly was a theme this morning about our uncertainty, and conveying that uncertainty is really, really hard. How we indicate the risks,  which are almost as important as the central tendency forecast, is something we’re going to need to work on. There are issues about the market’s putti ng too much weight on what we say.  I was surprised, Mr. Chairman, by the reaction to your testimony and how much emphasis they seemed to put on our projections, indicating where they  thought things would be going forward.  In retrospect, I wonder whether there are ways of indicating our degrees of  uncertainty around those 117 of 158          projections, and I think we need to honor and encourage the divers ity and exchange of views in the Committee. All those issues are hard with respect to the outlook for inflation and economic activity, and they are even harder with respect to the outlook for interest rates and our policy path in particular. The issues of cond itionality, overweighting, and flexib ility become even more acute when we start talking about our own policy path. There are times, and the summer of 2003 wa s one of those, in which the market’s interpretation of where our policy path might be  has the potential for impeding our ability to meet our objectives.  In 2003 and the subsequent year or two years,  I think we were right to put some emphasis on that because, if we hadn’t, it would have been harder to meet our goals.  But for the most part, I think the markets should be ab le to infer what we’re going to do from how we talk about our goals and our assessment of th e economic developments, and we don’t need to discuss the immediate outlook for po licy.  It would be nice to think about ways of getting away from this business of signaling what we’re goi ng to do exactly at the next meeting, partly because we don’t know but also because it does some times build in expectations that affect our 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan. MS. MINEHAN. Oh, dear. So you didn’t want  answers to all of th ese questions?  This homework assignment was significant.  [Laughter] I agree with a lot of what Governor Kohn has said. In my view, anyway, the principa l goal behind central ba nks’ communicating what they’re doing and why is that they need to be  accountable for their act ions in a democratic society. I see that as the primary goal of all forms of central bank communication—that is, the preservation of the legitimacy of  the central bank.  We’re not elec ted officials.  We’re appointed 118 of 158         officials. We’re doing someth ing that’s critical as far as  the economy’s performance is concerned, and we need to be accountable for it. A secondary goal is to facil itate the transmission of monetary policy by better shaping the But in that regard, in terms of the market’s faci litating the direction of policy, what we do really ought to be more important—and I think Don wa s saying this—than what we say about what we’ve done. Communication can hel p, but it can also hinder shor t-term market perceptions.  Over the longer run, what we actually do will create or destroy our credibility. We also need—and I think this is consiste nt with what Don was saying—to think about constraints. I would be very concerned if we ended up trying to  convey the future course of policy with certainty except in ve ry unusual circumstances, like those that began in mid-2003.  In that regard, I took a measure of confidence in so me of the Chairman’s discussion in the policy round with regard to being encouraged that major market participants weren’t unanimous in what they thought we were going to do, that there was a range of thought out th ere.  I think we can learn from that.  If we force everyone to have  a certain view about what we’re doing and then they just feed back to us what we’ve told them, we’re losing a lot in terms of understanding what’s going on in the market. About some of the other questions here, I’ll just try to hit the highlights.  On quantity— we ought to think not about how  much we communicate or how many instruments we have or how different they are but about their effectivene ss.  It seems to me that we ought to try to convey the uncertainties in the policy process in the most flexible and expansive of our communication instruments—our minutes, the se miannual reports, the Chairman’s testimony, and the speeches that we give. The least flexib le and least expansive fo rms of communication, in 119 of 158          particular the statement, ought to be used to convey less-subtle information.  Thus, as I’ve often said in the past—and I think President Pool e’s recommendations have  been in the same direction—we ought to focus more in our meeting statements on what we did and why and leave the longer, more-nuanced discussion to  the minutes or the semiannual reports. If I had had a vote at this meeting, I wouldn’t have dissented  on the pause, and I was in favor of alternative B with the enhanced section to make it more  hawkish.  But when you step back and you think about a hawkish pause, you wonder whether you’re asking your statement to do a lot of work for you, particularly if you think you’re going to have to fill in exactly what you meant by that statement in subsequent communica tions over the following weeks.  So I think some of that is a little tough. On content—I don’t want to get into inflation targeting.  Yes, we have to talk about it, and we’ll get into that later in the year, I suppose.  On forward-looking information—that goes back to uncertainty. I would not like to get into  the process, like some central banks, of giving a future policy path. There are ways of fac ilitating the market’s understanding of what our forecasts are and where we see the risks. Maybe  we can do a better or more complete job with our semiannual information, but I wouldn’t like to get into communica ting a policy path.  Finally, on the subject of individuals ve rsus a committee—I don’t think the Committee should constrain individuals.  That’s what the committee process is about—that we ought to feel free to express our opinions here as well as outsid e the Committee.  However, I also think that, at times, circumstances are such that a number of us are speaking around the same time, which creates the impression of committing the Committee.  I would want all of us to think hard and long about how we shape our public statements.  Even though we all are very careful about not committing the Committee by saying that these ar e our views and not the Committee’s views, 120 of 158             there are lots of ways of saying things within our various statemen ts that can act more or less to bind our hands going forward, and I’d like us all to be sensitive to that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Don, I appreciate the outline that you gave in terms of raising the questions.  I’ll be straightforward. As far as goals—what we are doing and why is the important part of commu nication.  That’s our obligation. That is part of transparency, and it serves us well.  Regarding our view of the future—I think we should outline that in terms of the balance of risks. What we’re doing now is just about right, frankly.  We need to get away from the idea of trying to signal or giving a po licy path.  I think that  gets us into some difficulties. In addition, it binds Committee memb ers who may not agree into the future, and that’s a disadvantage to the Committee in the long run. Having said that, I still think what we’re doi ng right now is pretty darn good.  Having the statement to say here’s what we did and why a nd the minutes to show the nuances of the views gives further information to the markets and serv es us well.  Speeches may sometimes raise the media’s attention, but I think they have served us well; I don’t think that we’ve gotten ourselves into too many problems with them.  Once we get through the discussion in October in terms of the price goals and that sort of  thing, how we communicate may change.  So we may need to have another discussion of this.  But for the moment, with those comments, I’m pretty satisfied with where we are. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow. MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’l l comment on just three areas, in the spirit of being general here.  First, on the goals—I thought th e goals that yo u put into the document you distributed were very good.  They we re very well stated and had an appropriate 121 of 158         balance. I didn’t think that they constrain open disc ussion at the meetings.  The communication of uncertainty and conditionality is difficult, but part of our goal should be to do it better.   Second, on the quantity of information and the forward-looking content—that whole series of questions that you as ked—I’d divide my comments into two parts.  One, if we do go with some type of quantitative guideline, we will need to release more information.  We’d need something like an inflation report, maybe quarter ly, such as other central banks have, just to explain and elaborate on the gui deline and how the economy was doi ng versus that quantitative guideline. I don’t think we could just stay with the twice-a-year  report that we give now in detail. Third, we should talk about longer-term forecas ts than we do now.  That’s an important part of this. In fact, if this Committee decides not to go with quantitative guidelines, we could accomplish many of the objectives by just having longer-term forecasts for the economy.  If we did these longer-term forecasts, we’d have to address many of the issues that are discussed in the sections here—the policy assumption question, for example.  We now do that based on appropriate policy, but we could do that in different ways.  But th e longer forecasts would allow us to convey policy goals, to discuss expected paths to achieving those goals, and to take into account the range of opinions rega rding the paths and goals without necessarily having us agree to a quantitative guideline. At  this point, I’m agnostic on the question of whether we should have a quantitative guidelin e.  I should say that I really haven’ t decided yet and that the topic is for further discussion.  In any case, longer-term fo recasts would be one option to consider if we did not go with a quantitative guideline. Of course, if we did go with a quantitative guideline, we could also have longer-term forecasts.  But I think the longer-term forecasts would help us improve our formulation of monetary policy, eith er with or without a quantitative guideline. 122 of 158           I want to mention just one other point about the policy conditioning.  I hope someone could do research on the Bank of  England approach.  Don, I know you’ve been there. They present a forecast conditioned on the market expectat ions for policy interest rates.  They also do an alternative based on an unchanged rate path.  They’ve given us an example of one case in which the forecast based on the market showed that inflation would be outside the guideline when they published it, and the market immediatel y reversed its view as to what the Bank of England was able to do on policy without the Ba nk’s saying anything.  Just the publication of that forecast itself accomplished a lot of their obj ective.  Of course, we’d have to be explicit about the technical details underlying the market exp ectations of the forecast,  but that’s sort of a technical part of this. We’re off to a good start, and I particularly like the goals that you set forth. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Th ank you.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me make just a few comments.  I, too, like the goals. To me, the overarching objective of  our communication policy should be to enhance the effectiveness of monetary polic y.  The goals that have been id entified in this latest paper— which I take to mean making sure that, insofa r as possible, we build public support for our policies and we work toward anchoring expectat ions—both work in that direction.  It’s very important that the public broadly define d understands what we’re doing and why.  One implication of that thought is that we don’ t want to make the statements too terse.  Now, I agree that they are supplemented by th e minutes, testimony, speeches, and so on and so forth, but many people are wedded to the 2:15 p.m.  announcement and the interpretations of that announcement, both immediately in the afternoon on CNBC and so forth and the next morning in the newspapers. If we make the statement too terse, we’re going to leave people sitting around 123 of 158          saying, “Well, we know what they did, but we don’ t have much of an understanding of why, how they view the world, where they think the risks lie,” et cetera.  So I would be careful about working really hard to shorten the statement. One place we’ve had a lot of success, in my opinion, is in articulating our price stability goal, why that’s the appropriate goal, and how it relates to the dual mandate.  We’ve had more success than I would have predic ted, quite honestly, when we star ted to articulate that more forcefully a good number of years ago.  There mi ght be something to be learned from that approach because I think we have been pretty cons istent about that message and even some of its nuances. We are going to get to the question about a numerical objective for inflation.  When we do, we’re going to have to think long and hard—I suspect this doesn ’t come as any surprise to anybody—about how that is going to play out in po licysetting, in decisionmaking.  We may need to provide some sort of backgr ound paper to the public at large if  we adopt it—in other words, here is what we’re doing, here’s what we think th e implications are, here’s how it’s going to play out in a policy role, as best we can see it. That ’s just something to thi nk about for the future.  I think I’ll stop there. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Yellen. MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think this Committee has made huge strides over the past decade toward greater transparen cy and more-effective communication, an example being that—it was in 1994, I guess—we actually star ted issuing post-meeting statements.  I think we’ve seen significant dividends from those innova tions.  They have advanced the goals of both policy effectiveness and accountability. Our communi cation strategy at this point, in my view, is 124 of 158        not fundamentally broken, and so I hope that what  we can accomplish in the coming months is to produce some improvements in current practic e without going for wholesale changes.  I thought today I would just touch on a couple of points that I’ve been thinking about relating to communications, without getting into specifics.  Frankl y, I think the goals are fairly noncontroversial. I regard them as pretty much motherhood and apple pie issues.  What’s challenging is figuring out exactly how to use communications better bot h internally in the Committee and externally to serve our policy goals.  A couple of cautionary notes: First, I want to endorse the point that Don made that we should not put in our list of goals that our objective is to maximize transparency for the sake of greater transparency. The rese arch in this area provides very ambiguous advice about how much transparency is optimal.  Second, we need to be careful that our communications don’t actually impede the process of making appropriate policy decisions or our ability to do so.  In contrast to some of you, I have generally favored the incl usion of forward-looking language in post-meeting statements, at least when the Committee has a reasonably clear id ea of where policy is going, as it has until quite recently.  But including such gui dance does have the potential for building false expectations that can constrain our actions. I hope that we will continue to provide forward-looking guidance to the public be cause I think it does enhance the effectiveness of our policy actions.  But I think we will need to be very clear that those kinds of policy pronouncements are not unconditional commitments to future actions, and we need to continue to emphasize data dependence. I want also to emphasize a point that Cathy made, which is that communication is a two-way street by which we communicate with markets and the public but we also receive feedback from markets and the public concer ning economic conditions and expectations 125 of 158      concerning the future. We benefit from that f eedback perhaps as much as or more than the public benefits from the utterances that we make .  That is a kind of independent reality check on our forecast and analysis.  Therefore, we have to  be careful to ensure that these outside voices aren’t drowned out by people who parrot back what we say.  There are times when I have very much worried that our communications have turn ed the markets into a mirror in which we see little more than our own reflection. Now I’d like to spend just a couple of minutes on what to me is the most critical challenge that we face as we go forward with our communication strategy. It relates to the apparent dichotomy between speaking with one voi ce and speaking as nineteen individuals.  The question is how to provide the public with the cl earest and most coherent description of our collective goals, strategies, and policies while continuing to promote an environment in which diverse opinions among the ninet een FOMC participants are not only tolerated but encouraged.  In the past we have managed this balanc ing act in different ways depending on the circumstances, and we’re going to need that kind  of flexibility as we go forward.  On the one hand, there are settings in which the Committee pr ovides a reasonably unified view to the public; that occurs in our post-meeting st atements and also in the Chairman’s testimony to the Congress.  On the other hand, we have a number of outlets for the expression of me mbers’ diverse views— the FOMC meeting minutes, participants’ speeches,  and the ranges of FOMC forecasts that are published in the Monetary Policy Re port.  I think that type of a pproach, of having some unified statements and many opportunities for expression of  diverse opinions, is us eful.  First, it gives the public a reasonably accurate se nse of both the areas of consensus in the FOMC and the range of opinion. Second, taking an “agree to disagr ee” approach lessens the likelihood that the FOMC will become trapped in a kind of group-think mentality, in which we end up conforming 126 of 158            for conformity’s sake.  Of course, with the fr eedom to disagree, we do have a responsibility, when we make statements, to be careful that t hose statements are not interpreted as representing the views of the Committee as a whole.  Finally, an approach that tries to limit the range of issues on which a committee as big as ours attempts to speak with a united voice will end up enhancing the sense of collegiality  and cooperation in the Committee. The post-meeting statement provides a concre te example of the tricky balancing act that we confront. We all know it’s often easier to agree on a decision concerning the federal funds rate than it is to agree in ev ery detail about why we came to that decision, let alone about what we expect going forward. It’s impractical for the statement to convey the full range of our opinions and to attempt to give very detailed explanations of the Committee’s thinking—again,  it tends to ignite disagreements about which specifics to include or to exclude and about even the precise phrasing of each and every line. So in thinking about that, I find myself wondering if a better approach might be to re cognize the intrinsic limits of the statement and to focus on communicating only necessary elements that clearl y lie within the consen sus view, leaving fuller discussion to the minutes and other things. The same issue about unity versus diversity is  going to arise when we come to discussing our longer-term inflation objective.  I do gr eatly favor increasing clarity concerning the Committee’s long-term inflation objective, but fra nkly I’m uncertain which approach is going to be the most attractive to accomplish that.  There is a range of possibilities. One possibility is that the Committee could provide that type of inform ation through the publicat ion of the range and central tendency of participants’ longer-term inflation projections, which presumably reflect ultimately their inflation objective.  Another possi bility is that the Committee could try to agree on the specific numerical objective to communi cate to the public, assuming that a sufficient 127 of 158          consensus does exist in the Committee.  Certainl y, the benefit of the latte r approach would be a clearer signal to the public, which would be benefici al.  But the tradeoff here  is that we have to be careful not to straitjacket part icipants into a particular view that they don’t fully endorse.  So as we go forward, I think we’re going to have to a pproach these issues case  by case.  In general, as I think about the quest ion of unity versus diversity in ou r communications, I am moving to the conclusion that it’s probably bett er to err on the side of preservi ng the advantages of the diversity of views at the cost of somewhat  less of the clarity and coherenc e that would come if we could provide a unified voice to the public. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker. MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The first set of questions from the subcommittee had to do with goals and principles.  The first principle I’d bring to this is that money is intrinsically worthless and has value only  because people expect it to have value in the future. So, to be a little provo cative, I’ll say that m onetary policy is about people’s expectations, and everything else is just commentary.  Theref ore, I fully support the first goal—helping people form expectations regarding our future policy actions is a reasonable goal for communication policy. The second goal seems clear, too—ensur ing accountability to the people who have granted us this monopoly on policy actions. It’s important to be clear about what’s meant by communication regarding future policy actions. It may mean saying some thing about the future path of  interest rates—and we’ve done that several times—but it doesn’t have to.  An  alternative approach is to articulate what objectives will determine our interest rate choice s in the future, and in principle, someone who understands our objectives and the constraints we’re  under will be able to figure out what we’ll choose in any given circumstance.  I think this offers really g ood prospects for overcoming some 128 of 158          of the problems that the Committee has enc ountered with the fo rward-looking guidance language, when we essentially tell the public what interest rate settings we think will likely be required to achieve our objectives. It seems as though communicating that  would be enhanced by telling them what our objectives are.  In a sense, that would aid efficiency. The subcommittee asked what constraints affect our communications.  The obvious one that comes to mind is time consistency—essentiall y, the idea that our claims about our future actions are credible.  People have to think that our future selves, be they us or our successors, will actually want to follow through on the actions that we’ve implied by our communications— we are selecting what our future selves are going to select.  The question of whether our communications will constrain our future selves immediately arises.  Now, one can make some stark assumptions about this ques tion.  In the literature, you typically see just two polar cases analyzed: One is “yes, totally”—the perfect co mmitment case; the other is  “no, not at all”—the complete discretion case.  But for the purposes of  our discussion, I think it  makes sense to adopt the intermediate view that our future selves are likely to view it as costly to be perceived as taking actions that contradict wh at we had previously communicated.  So I’m happy to assume that our statements are not cheap  talk, to use game theory lan guage.  At the same time, I don’t think the credibility of our communications is perfect or costless.  At all junctures we need to think through whether we will want to follow through on what we’re implying by our communications. That idea is related to a separate issue th at often arises in di scussions of inflation targeting and communications, and that is whether communication will reduce our future flexibility.  At this point, let me just say that  to stabilize the value of  money we have already sacrificed a great deal of flexib ility.  I’d claim that we’ve given up the flexibility to inflate or 129 of 158         deflate at 10 percent in any given year, in the near future.  We’ve given up a lot of things to convince people that money should have about the value it has now.  So it really isn’t a question of giving up flexibility; it’s a que stion of what flexibility we wa nt to give up.  Here I’d make another point as well. If communi cation is going to have any value at all, it’s going to persuade some people to change their minds about what ac tions we would take in the future.  Well, if that’s true, then in some sense it has to invol ve our giving up some of the flexibility that the public has perceived us to have. So while there are flexibilities we would like to preserve, there are flexibilities we’d like to give up.  I don’t think flexibility per se is a trump card in this situation. The subcommittee asked about what informa tion should be communicated.  I’ll just focus on one thing that I talked about earlier today, and that’s  our long-run inflati on objective.  Let me be precise about what I mean here.  Averagi ng across all possible futures, taking into account how we are expected to reac t in each possible future, what is the inflation rate n periods from now?  It may not be perfectly certain, but what is  the average across all of  those futures, taking into account how we’re going to react?  Let me define that average as long-run expected inflation, at least the long-run e xpected inflation associated with  the public’s beliefs about our reactions that are built in to that thought experiment I just de scribed.  In most of the standard models (except for those in which some learning about the policymaker is occurring)—models with Taylor rules or some other fixe d reaction function plopped in—if you take n out long enough, like five years or so, long-ru n expected inflation is a single number that never varies.  As I mentioned earlier this year, I don’t think that’s the world we live in now.  Personally, I think that we ought to try to agree on a value for where we want inflati on to be on average and communicate it to the public. I don’t see the benef it in terms of short-run flexibility of letting 130 of 158           expected inflation n years ahead have a big, wide, and disperse probability distribution around it or having the mean of that distri bution fluctuate a lot.  I can see the value of being flexible about how fast—a couple of years or a couple of quarter s—we return inflation to target or about how far from target we let it drift; bu t I just don’t see the value of allo wing fluctuation in our inflation objective years out. Whenever I encounter one of those software  programs for calculating your retirement income and they ask for a lot of assumptions —such as your age, your salary, your age at retirement, and how fast your wages will go up, a nd all—and they get to a box where they ask what the inflation rate is going to be, I think to myself, I don’t know what to put in there.  [Laughter] And I think—that’s ex actly right.  I know what I’d like to put in there,  but at this point that’s just wishful thinking on my part, and I’m hesitant to do that.  I’m certainly not going to do that for my brother-in-law when he asks.  [Laughter] I think it’s a real tragedy th at we don’t have anything to te ll the country for circumstances like that. It’s the one thing that  we ought to be able to pin do wn in the long run; it’s the one thing we know we can deliver. We can’t deliver  a predicted average real  growth rate; we know we can’t deliver a predicted average unemployment rate; but we all agree we have a fair amount of latitude about the long-run infl ation forecast.  Anyway, that’s what I have to say about this subject.

MR. GUYNN. Mr. Chairman, since I’m not going to be here in October, I probably should sit quietly; but I can’t resi st.  I think almost everything ha s been said.  I want just to comment quickly on a couple of things. I’m not su re we really talked about a very fundamental 131 of 158        question—that is, who it is we are trying to comm unicate with.  That deserves a bit of discussion, it seems to me. Building on the whole notion of trying to quant ify our objectives, I th ink we’ve seen what a box we can get ourselves in. In the absence of something, we all start offering our own quantitative whatever. At the current time, we ’re in a position in which many of us have specified what we think our comfort zone is. We haven’t explained how  we’re going to measure it; we haven’t reconciled the differences across people; we haven’t explained what we’re going to do when we’re not there; so we’ve gotten ourselves in this kind of halfway house.  Whether we’d like to talk about inflation targeting and all the things that go with it or not, we’re going to have to stop and deal with it. We haven’t really talked very much about the role of the forecasts—and I hope policymaking has always been based on forecasts —but we have been much more explicit about that role in recent times.  That opens up the whole question of whose forecast and how we talk about forecasts at all the different stages. Finally—and I can’t resist commenting—I think the greatest short-term tension regards the issue of what to do with the four-paragraph post-meeting statement and what to do with the minutes.  I’ve more and more come to the view of Bill Poole that less is more.  We simply can’t get very much of the different ways of thinking into that four-paragraph statement.  I think that’s an impossible task.  We all think about it very differently.  We’ve heard it today. The statement is simplistic.  I would hope when you get around to talking about the issue that it would be clear that the minutes offer a much better way of  trying to help people understand not only the uncertainty but the range of view s that go with the policymaking a nd not let that little simplistic statement after a meeting become the most impo rtant communication.  End of story. Thank you. 132 of 158

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Th ank you.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Let me concentrate on the forw ard-looking information on the federal funds path or something associated with it.  One of the problems I have with Janet’s po sition is that, every time we put that information in, we  need to have an exit strategy of  how we’re going to  get it out.  As soon as you stop putting it in, you get yourself tangled up.  In fact, I th ink that’s where we are today and one of the reasons  that we have the langua ge in the statement that we do today.  I would put it in only under very special circumstances with a clear understanding of the strategy of how to get it out. The argument of this whole bi as/tilt language goes back  to Volcker, I belie ve; it was used as a device to try to produce more agreement with in the Committee.  Then it was continued under Greenspan.  It wasn’t announced to  the public.  So the idea was th at you would get some people to go along with what the Ch airman wanted by saying  that we’ll have a tilt toward X or Y, up or down; it was meant to produce a la rger vote for the cons ensus.  Once we st arted to announce it publicly, it started to affect the markets.  I was part of that decisi on.  I was in favor of it at the time, and I have since had very strong second thoughts  about it—in part because of the experience of trying to get out from  under it once we st arted down that road. We need to put more thought into explaining in our statement the deci sion that was reached, which we don’t do very mu ch of really.  We don’t put much text ar ound the reason for the decision, compared with the risks or  the foreshadowing of what we might do in the future.  So that’s where I would put my effort in drafting the statement. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree that  the goals listed in the subcommittee’s memo are the right  goals.  However, in thinking about the next few questions 133 of 158                  concerning the quantity and the c ontent of the information and the nature of any forward-looking information that we provide, I find it difficul t to make judgments with out knowing where we’re going to emerge from our discussion about what policy approach we take, especially the discussion about whether we’re going to adopt a numerical inflatio n objective.  As others have said, I think that our communication practices need to reinforce our policy strategy.  In fact, we should consider our communication practices to be a part of our policy strategy. So, for example, if we move down the path of adopting a nu merical objective for inflation, then the appropriate comm unication strategy may simply be to provide the explicit inflation objective with little guida nce about specific polic y moves beyond referenc e to our performance against that objective.  In that case, I think there would be less need for information in the statement that follows our meeting.  However,  it might require more information in our semiannual report to the Congress. Then regarding the forward-lo oking language, again I think it depends on whether or not we adopt a numerical objective for inflation.  A suc cessful communication stra tegy should first and foremost give the public confidence  that we’re going to produce low inflation ov er the long run.  I don’t think that a good communi cation policy strategy, as others have already said, necessarily means that we have to make sure the public can anticipate our  next policy move.  If we have a numerical objective helping us to anchor long-term inflation expectations, then that forward-looking guidance might be reserved for those times when the Committee has a great deal of certainty in the course of its near-term policy move s or when it perceives that the cost of being misunderstood is just exceptionally great. Regarding the last set of questions from the subcommitt ee involving the individual communications or th e Committee communicatio ns, I believe that wh atever communication 134 of 158               strategy we adopt, it is  important to preserve our ability to give  and express inde pendent views, especially about forecasts, policy strategies, actions, and so forth.  It’s clear that each of us formulates our own independent opi nions about policy actions, and we form those opinions from a sense of how we think ec onomic conditions will evol ve.  I’d like to  preserve the ability that we enjoy today of sharing our  independent thinking and the climat e that I sense we have today of a Committee that’s very skilled at building consensus around  different perspectiv es but yet sees the benefit of respectful di ssent.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Than k you.  President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Well, Mr . Chairman, we do have  responsibility for a fi at currency, and my straightforward and undiplomatic  way of describing what we do for a living is that we are performing a great confidence game .  I think that’s important to be ar in mind.  As President Yellen said, this is apple pie and motherhood.  The answ er is “yes” to the first questions, but there are questions about which agents we  are talking about and, when we talk about generating well-informed expectations, how we do so. I mentioned earlier, to Governor Kohn’s emba rrassment, “full frontal exposure,” and I think that’s not an unimportant point.  To maintain the confidence game th at we have to maintain and—if you’ll permit me to say this having experienced the other side—to maintain the last bastion of integrity in Washington—and I feel  very strongly about that—we have  to be very careful that we preserve a bit of modesty and myst ery to accomplish our goals.  The really tough  part is how far we go, and that’s what we’re going to have to talk about going dow n the path.  For example, I’m somewhat uncomfortable, even though I have great respect for President Moskow , about making long-term forecasts.  The further out you forecast, the more probable error is.  I am wary of 135 of 158                      exposing our vulnerabilities, and I th ink we should be mindful of that  as we go through time.  That’s just one thought. Another thought is about the statement.  I ma y have forgotten my logic here, but I think we should be as straight as Occam’ s razor—that is, we should take as few variables as possible to explain what we deci de to do.  I do think th e minutes are very important for illumi nation.  I don’t want to manipulate the minutes, but I think we can use them quite effectivel y.  In my statement earlier in the meeting,  when we were discussing our view of the economy, I said that I think we did that very effectively the last time around. Then a third point—I’m a strong believer in pa rtnerships.  I mentioned this at a dinner with the Presidents last night. I’m also a very strong believer in a strong managing-partner model, having worked all my life in th e private sector in partnerships.  But I do think it’s very, very important to have a diversity of vi ews, and so I second what has been said at the table on that front as well.  Those are my th ree comments, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Than k you.  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support the broad goals th at are laid out here.  In thinking about communication, I see that one challenge we will have relates to some of the dialogue we had today.  We set some long-term goals.  How do we  link those to wh at we do in individual meeting actions and decisions?  We al ready talked about how in flation has been above our 2 percent top goal for two years, and it is likely to be so for two ye ars more.  How would we explain that when we were trying to go forward?  Th is is the sort of proble m that corporations have every year, when they se t goals for shareholder returns, but then the earnings ju mp around like crazy quarter to quarter. Well, we’re going to have the same kind of issue. It raises the question of whether we want to talk about how we’re going to get from one place to another.  In other words, a 136 of 158              company can say that they took th ese big chargeoffs , but that will reduce the co st base, or that they are making an acquisition.  We need to have some real dialogue about what a set goal is going to mean for our short-run communic ations after each meet ing and for the policy path.  It’s the difference between setting the goal and implementi ng and executing it effec tively.  If we can’t communicate how we intend  to implement effectivel y, then we ough t to have second thoughts about the goals that we’re settin g.  Since I’ve been here we really haven’t talked a lo t about how to tie those two together. On the forward-looking inform ation—it might have been appropriate back when we started this 25 basis point step-up each meeting.  I’m glad  we’re now taking the po sition that we’re trying to push the risk back to the market.  The market has to make its own forecast of what’s likely to happen.  We need to be clear as to what the key drivers are and pick  the few vital elements that we really all can agree on.  We need to communicat e that well but make the market judge where those variables are likely to go in the outlook.  I don’t th ink we do a service to ourselves or to the market if they feel they can s it back and let us make th e call.  The moral hazard an d other issues there are simply too great. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Than k you.  Governor Warsh. 

[SECTION]

MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just a few brie f comments.  Firs t, with respect to the concision of our statemen t and the minutes, I guess in a perfect world the minutes would come out much sooner after our stat ement, but I recognize all the work  that needs to get done to get consensus and understanding on those. I have a modest suggestion, which we can take back up in October.  The minutes could end up being released somewhat sooner but also be more corporate in nature .  It strikes me that a lot of the communication that we do thro ugh the minutes is usef ul for history and for an understanding of 137 of 158             many of the nuances that we’ve ta lked about but is probably not th at useful for some of the other communication purposes discussed here.  It would cer tainly be useful if the crucial arguments in the discussion we had today were av ailable in the minutes before three weeks have elapsed.  That would take some of the bu rden off figuring out what  goes into the statement.   Without burdening the staff by getting the same product do ne sooner, we could think rather about what should be part of a corporate-style set of minu tes.  We’ve taught the market that a full set of  the minutes would come out, but my own suggestion is that the full set could be somewhat de layed.  That’s just a sort of provocative suggestion with out as much discussion and thought as  we’d want, but I think it partly addresses the statement issue.  Second, on striking the right balance betw een individuals and th e Committee, I’m more convinced than ever, now th at I have gone through four FOMC me etings, that the diverse views that people express on monetary policy outside this meeting are important and are critically independent. What I’m going to say is not an attempt to break that divergence of views or dissuade people from sharing them.  I think it’s actually more problemat ic when FOMC participan ts say simi lar things between meetings.  For example, Mr. Chairman, let’s say that you said X and th at 18 of us went out and repeated X more or less identically after the m eeting.  The market unders tanding of that is no longer X or 2X but perhaps 10X or  12X, and I think that does prove problematic.  A burden should be on each of us, when we take  our messages to different places be tween meetings, to be thinking about the consequences, in particular, when we’re sa ying similar things.  None of that means to say that if you believe Y instead of X you should not  be able to go sc ream that from th e hills; but if you believe a nuance of X, you really have to consider how the mark ets are going to understand the repetition that they’ve heard. 138 of 158                   Third, just a brief point a bout market disciplin e—I think President Yellen and President Minehan made reference to this.  We’ve been fairly cognizant over the past several meetings about getting the markets to do their own work and not to rely on us .  That market discipline is very important.  Governor Kohn said at  the outset that the pu rpose of this discussion is not to have transparency for transparen cy’s sake but to try to get to the right monetary policy objectives.  It strikes me as though we could well test the limits of transparency by sharing too much  information and getting the markets in a pos ition where they stop doing mu ch of the home work we’ve only started getting them to do at this point.  The right place to come to that  judgment is somewhere around where that transparency en ds up making them more lemmings than we’d ideally like.  I must admit that I’m not exac tly sure how to pull that off, but it stri kes me that’s the way to structure or to think about that disc ussion.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The goals are pretty  clearly stated, and I have no real problems with them.  I agree that communi cation and transparency ar e really a key part of maintaining and enhancing our own credibility.  I al so understand, as I liste n to people around the table and other conversations, that some of these issu es have no easy or clear answers to them, and I should note in advance that my own views are e volving as I think about and understand the nuances of the issues.  I agree with Pres ident Yellen.  I’d like to applaud the Committee because in the past ten years there have really been great strides in both transparency and communication. Part of the challenge, it seems to me, is how  we meet these goals.  I think it’s true that putting some limits on what informatio n is released is probably necessary over certain periods of time.  For example, I wouldn’t advocate opening the FOMC meetin gs to the public; I think that would not be terribly useful.  On the other hand, Governor Warsh was just  talking about perhaps 139 of 158              releasing minutes earlier or faster or some vers ion of them, maybe with incomplete detail, but including the tone and nature of the discussion.  I think it could be  fairly useful and informative, particularly if it noted disagreements or discussi ons in terms of where th e tension happened to be within the meeting. I spent se veral months at the Bank of En gland a couple of years ago and watched the give and take among committee member s at the MPC and also wa tched them go out in public and discuss their different views and why they disagreed with  each other.  That was very instructive to me because they did it without appare ntly adding to volatility in the marketplace.  The The information releas ed might differ depending on the ty pe of monetary regime we think we’re in—whether in a regime of inflation targeting or one of full discretion.  However, regardless of the regime, the need for po licymakers to clearly communicat e what their goals are, their understanding of the economy’s cu rrent economic conditions and expect ed future conditions, and then the reasons for their decisions is an important part of communication. As to the quantity of information, quantity and quality to me are intert wined, so I’m  going to talk about both of them together.  Again, I applaud the expedited rele ase of the minutes.  Instituting that was a tremendous step forwar d, and I think it’s a very good idea.  However, I would favor the Committee’s releasing some additional pieces of information.  I obviously favor stating an explicit definition of price stabilit y because doing so would help clarify our goals.  The current practice of citing the range and central tendenc y of members’ forecasts  is fine, but I woul d favor our releasing more information, perhaps in a quarterly forecast or  in something li ke an inflation report, to help convey to the marketplace and the public what our ra nge of views is and where the Committee stands on the state of the economy. 140 of 158                 It might help the public’s assessment of our views if we based our forecasts on some underlying policy assumptions rather  than on what one might call appropriate policy, which might differ from member to member obviously and would likely not be  well understood by the public anyway. One sugges tion that has already be en mentioned is conditioni ng the forecasts on the projections about potential GDP woul d be important as well because that information, again, will help the markets and ma rket participants understand wher e the Committee is  coming from. In regard to forward-looking information, I think there are a number  of things that the FOMC could and should communicat e, but its current expectation ab out the future path of the fed funds rate is not one of them.  I don’t think that’s a very good prac tice in general.  However, I do think that what we need to do is talk more about what our goals are, what our forecasts of those goals are, and even more in a qualitative sense the process by which we think we’re going to get there.  That is to say, talking about how monetary policy will resp ond to various events—I hesitate to use the phrase “decision rule”—wouldn’t necessarily say anything ab out the future pa th of the fed funds rate, but it would be  very informative.   It’s critical, as has already been mentioned,  that the FOMC member s agree on what the goals are.  The members don’t need  to agree on the mode l of the economy or the channel by which they think monetary policy actual ly operates.  Indeed, given the state of economic science, the differences in models and channels can aid in poli cy formation.  Similarly, since dissents at this meeting are public, dissenters should feel free to expl ain the reasons for their dissent.  We shouldn’t discourage presidents and other members from e xpressing their views about the state of the economy and the process.   Committee members should be free to  indicate how their views on the 141 of 158                    economy are evolving.  In fact, I think that doi ng so supports our goal of  helping the public form sound expectations of what po licy is actually going to be. 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman Geithner. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you. I want to start by saying that I think we’re confronted with a se t of issues that really aren’t principa lly about communicatio n and transparency.  I think they’re fundamentally ab out how we conduct monetary policy and the monetary policy regime we’re going to operate under. I want to say a little about what I see as the hierarchy of challe nges or decisions we have to make in that context.  We have to have a discussion about what ob jectives, particularly in terms of inflation, will guide this  Committee’s decisions goi ng forward, and I think it’s hard to do that without a discussion in quantitative terms.  We also need to get in the position of thinking and talking through more directly and candidly at these meetings  how we make decisi ons about the most appropriate path for in flation and output, esp ecially at times when we’re way off our basic objectives.  We don’t really do th at now.  We’ve been living with a lot of ambiguity about whether we’re operating with, in effect, an objective of getti ng core PCE down to some particular level at a certain time or not, and I don’t th ink we can be comfortable living with that degree of ambiguity much longer.  In so me ways, that set of issues is the first we have to confront.  We may not get consensus or resolution, but we have  to talk through those issues.   We also have to decide what we want to disclose in terms of our objectives, our forecast, the policy consistent with that forecast, and uncertainty. We face a lot of choi ces in terms of what we do and how we do it regarding quantitative versus qua litative and explicit  versus implicit approaches to communications.  Several of you said  that in our statements  we should simply say what we decided and why, but I d on’t think it’s quite that simple.  The “why” has a lot to do with 142 of 158                 the forecast, and to say nothing about the forecas t in the statement woul d be communicating little about the reasons for our policy decisions.  But the “w hat” is also not simple:  It is certainly not principally about whether or not we  move the fed funds rate.  The “w hat” we’re deciding has to do a lot with whether we take a view about or try to change or validate the ma rket expectations going forward over some period.  So I don’t think we can get through the choices about communication and transparency by just agreeing  that we want to limit ourselve s to the more-min imalist objectives of communicating what we  did and why.  It feels to me a little mo re complicated than that. The third point is a general po int.  If we are going to chan ge the regime, we can’t do it piecemeal.  We can’t decide that we want to an nounce a quantitative defini tion of long-term price stability without confront ing the kind of disclosure regime that we have to ad opt in support of that.  Also, we can’t think sensibly about the evolution of our disclosure regime  around the forecast, for example, without coming to  some greater understa nding about whether we disclo se a quantitative objective for inflation.  So I think they need to be viewed as a package.  For a sim ilar reason, I think we can’t approach this set of changes by saying let’s move on the things  that are easy or less contentious or have more of a co nsensus without having a better se nse of where we really want to go. That doesn’t mean that we sh ould change all at once or, if we decide to change things, we do them all together. We can still decide to have a graduated approach to introducing the changes in the regime, but before we make an incremental move, we  need to have a better sense about where we want ultimately to go.  If we don’t have consensus about  where we want to go, then it’s harder to It’s very healthy to have a candid discussion about what we think is wrong with our current regime.  I used to work with somebody who said to me, “Don’t bring me problems without solutions.”  Therefore, discomfort wi th a set of attributes of our regime relative to the experience of 143 of 158             other countries is really no t enough to justify change.  We have to  be able to look  at the proposals for change and be very comfortable that they’re going to respond to the pr oblem without leaving us with a set of other collateral risks or disadvanta ges.  It’s also good to  have a direct and open discussion about what we do not  want to try to achieve thro ugh communications.  I’m very uncomfortable with what I think it would be fair to say is a substantial faction in the academic profession now, which says that  the optimal communication policy of central banks should be to seek very close alignment between  the market’s expectations about  future policy and the central bank’s and to achieve that alignment in real ti me and not have long pe riods of wide divergence between what the market thinks and what we thin k is appropriate.  That position strikes me as highly unrealistic and complicated and ma ybe difficult to achieve, but we should talk through that issue. I think it’s also unrealistic  to say that we should avoid clarity about our views on the future course of the economy and policy.   That pure fog alternative s eems unsatisfying and uncomfortable to me. I have nothing to add to the disc ussion about diversity.  There ar e great benefits to diversity.  I do think we should try to a void having, because of  scheduling, many memb ers of the Committee talking in the same period.  It is difficult to achiev e but worth thinking about. Finally I just want to compliment the subcomm ittee.  The way you have laid out the issues is very nicely done.  I also want to  compliment the Chairman for appr oaching this subject very openly, having us try to think through all the difficul t choices involved togeth er, and allowing some analysis, debate, and a little competition for ideas help inform choices ab out how we go forward.  I think that approach is admira ble, and I commend you for it.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  Governor Kroszner. 144 of 158              

[SECTION]

 MR. KROSZNER. I’ll be very brief.  I think a number of the points that Vice Chairman Geithner made are excellent, in particular his emphasizing that we have to think about this as a package but not as necessarily mean ing that we must implement ever ything at once.  We may want to see how the pieces are working before we do that, but we do have to have the ultimate goals in mind.  We need to  have the whole thing together before  we can start moving forward because it could be quite dangerous to change some aspects of communication policy but then realize that, if we want to do something else different down the lin e, we’ll have to change them again.  So I think that approach is exactly the right one. Also because what we’re doing relates to any changes, we have  to think about the dynamics.  We see this now in the persistenc e of certain words in our statemen ts.  We use the word once, but then do we use it again or  do we not use it again?  Individual words take on an incredible amount of importance.  Now, one way to solv e that problem is perhaps to put out more and more words so that each one is diluted. [Laughter]  An awful lot of private-sector resources were devoted to the three-letter word “yet” th at came out of one of the statemen ts, when I believe that not a single member of the FOMC even noticed it.  I think that is problematic.  I’m not quite sure of the best way to solve that pr oblem, but I th ink we have to  be very sens itive to that. On the issue of the one versus the whole, the markets have a very strong perception of coordination among us.  Th e notion that the Governors are independent and that the Federal Reserve Bank Presidents are independent is considered lau ghable.  When people ask me  about that, they say, “Well, doesn’t he tell you what to do?”  I say, “N o, no one tells anyone wh at to do.”  Maybe you’d like to, [laughter] bu t that’s not how it operates.   Part of that notion is just a perception, and so having people speak at the same time may not be mu ch of a problem.  But the perception is that it’s a coordinated effort rather than a series of indi viduals who are expressing their views, and I think 145 of 158                   communicating the extent of our independence or the extent of our coordi nation is something that would actually go a long way towa rd things.  I was one of those aca demics that Don referred to as putting up those tables and trying to figure out whether we were independent or not, sort of rating us. But that is not what we’re supposed to be doing, and I hope my comments wi ll not be taken in that context. One final remark is that we have to be modest about what we’r e trying to do.  Part of this discussion is the way of conveying our uncertainty .  I would close my clas s on money and banking, and I’ll close my remarks here , by presenting a fantastic New Yorker  cartoon. It relates to the former Chairman and show s someone praying, just before going to bed, about the former Chairman, that he knows what he knows, he knows what he doesn’t know , and he knows the difference. It’s important for us to be able to try to convey to the markets that we know what we know, we know what we don’t know, and we  do know the difference.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let me add just a couple of very general comments.  I hope that in our discussions about co mmunication we’ll be aiming to ma ke policy work better.  I think that involves trying to make the markets and the public form expectations that are at least broadly consistent with our goals and our strategy and trying to anchor  long-term inflatio n expectations to the extent possible. Even  if you are skeptical abou t our ability to do this, yo u may still agree that we want to avoid miscommunicat ion and unnecessary volatility to the extent possible. I agree also that in general we don’t want to pr ovide the future funds rate path.  I see a lot of problems with that.  One of the reasons not to do it is that, if the market is  forced to infer the funds rate path from economic informa tion, that inference provides inform ation to us.  Ot herwise, they’re 146 of 158               simply repeating what we tell them.  In an ideal world, how would we get the market to infer our expected path?  Well, we would provide them w ith a conditional forecast wi th error bands and all kinds of conditioning assumption s, and we would tell them abou t our objective function, which would include not only the long-term objectives but also the relative weights on inflation and output and the shape of the risk aversi on coefficients and the like. Now, of course, we can’t do that.  Besides the technical diff iculties, as has already been pointed out, we have nineteen very  distinct points of view around th e table.  But I do think there are ways to communicate this kind of information to the public.  As an  example, in my  monetary policy testimony I very consciously—whether it was succe ssful or not I leave it to you to judge—talked about our Committee projections, whic h gave the public not only some  insight into what our general views were but also information about our pref erences because it showed  a relatively gradual going to try to bring inflation down  extremely quickly and extremely far.  In that respect, it was very useful, and I generally agree with President Mo skow and others that more-detailed and more-frequent projections might be a very useful way for us to go in the future. Finally, since we don’t have th e budget to hire a semiotician,  I do want to express some frustration with the coded language  that we rely on so heavily—I have been ex posed to some of the pitfalls that it can create.  I th ink that we are reaching the limits of what codes can provide, and I’d like to encourage us to think about ways to use quantitative information,  like forecasts,  to provide more information and thereby reduce the weight that’s placed on an y single words in statements and the like.  So those are just a few comments. I want to thank everybody for an excellent di scussion and for a lot of patience.  I appreciate it very much.  Our next meeting is on Wednesday, September 20, and we are adjourned. 147 of 158
