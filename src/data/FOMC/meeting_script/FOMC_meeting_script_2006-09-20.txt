 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Good morning, everybody. ALL. Good morning. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We have two milest ones to note today.  First, we’d like to welcome new Governor Rick Mishkin.  Welcome, Rick.  Rick attended FOMC meetings from ’94 to ’97 when he was on the New York Fed staff, but this is the first time he has gotten to sit at the big table. [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. MISHKIN. I wanted to sit right back there, but they wouldn’t let me.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  New York’s view is that they work for Rick.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. On a sadder note, to day is President Guynn’s last meeting.  He has been Bank president and FOMC member fo r ten years and has served the Atlanta Fed for a mere forty-two years.  We congratulate you.  We will have a lunch in your honor after the 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Thanks. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you for outsta nding service for an extended period of time.  Let’s begin, then, with Mr. Kos. MR. KOS.1  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Among market participants, September has a reputation for being difficult on portfo lios, for sudden bursts of volatility that lead to risk aversion and wider spreads, a nd for sometimes spectacular blowups in the speculative community. The ERM crisis in  1992, Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, and the aftermath of the terrorist att acks in 2001 are three of  the more notable examples. Until Monday, this year looked different.  Spreads were and they continue to be narrow. Volatility has generally been low, with the notable exception of energy.  Yields are benign, and equity prices, if anyt hing, have been rising in recent weeks.    1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). 3 of 132      The massive loss disclosed on Monday by a large hedge fund has had remarkably, almost suspiciously, little spil lover effects thus far.  But with political crises suddenly popping up in Hungary and Thailand, it may suggest that risks in some of these smaller, less-liquid market sectors such as emerging markets and commodities have risen. Overnight the Thai baht was slight ly weaker, Thai banks and markets were closed, and currencies and equity markets of neighboring countries  were, on balance, only marginally weaker.  Meanwhile in th e G3, markets have generally been calm, though recent moves suggest a more sober outlook for growth than had been priced in earlier this summer.    On page 1 of your handout, the top panel graphs the three-month Eurodollar deposit rate in black and the same rate th ree, six, and nine months forward in red since the beginning of the y ear.  In recent weeks, forward rates traded through the cash rate as assorted reports—especia lly housing and inflation data—convinced rate steady for sometime longer and (2) the prob ability of an ease early next year was far more likely than a resumption of the ti ghtening cycle.  That  view was seemingly shared by investors in the Treasury market.  As shown in the middle panel, two-year and ten-year yields have been gently dec lining since the June m eeting.  The ten-year yield currently trades about 50 basis points  below the target funds rate—the widest negative spread since March 2001. Meanwhile, various measures of the yield curve have now been mildly inverted for se veral weeks—perhaps also reflecting the ten-year breakeven rate and the five-year rate five years forward.  Both declined modestly since the last meeting, helped by in flation readings that did not repeat this spring’s elevated numbers and also by the m oderation of commodity prices in general and energy prices in particular. The view that growth may be less robust was reflected  in overseas markets as well. On page 2, the top panel graphs the calendar spread for interest rate futures between the December 2007 and the Decembe r 2006 contracts for the G5 economies since January 1. In recent weeks that spread  has, on balance, been declining slightly as markets have taken out tightenings that had been priced in for coming quarters.  Even in Europe, where the ECB has been  talking tough, market participants are reassessing what effect a U.S. slowdown w ould have on the ECB’s trajectory.  The middle panel graphs ten-year sovereign yi elds for the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and, as a proxy for the euro area, France.  Those yields rose during the first six months of the year and have retreated more recently.  While there is a story for each economy, the most recent sets of  data have been slightly less favorable, and forecasts for the next few quarters have been trimmed back.  Meanwhile, as shown by the middle right panel, U.S. a nd Canadian breakevens have declined slightly. In contrast, brea keven rates in the United Kingdom and France have risen somewhat.  Indeed, the ECB has repeated ly voiced concerns about rising headline inflation and the persis tence of that trend. 4 of 132         Japan is a somewhat special case.  Through midyear, forecasts for Japanese growth had been rising. Deflation was e bbing, loan growth was rising, and the BoJ opportunistically exited its quantitative easing policy in March and then exited the zero interest rate policy in mid-July.  However, as shown in the bottom left panel, yields could not get past 2 percent and then began to decline as data such as machinery orders disappointed  investors and led them to  question how fast the BoJ would raise interest rates. Then on Augus t 24, Japan released revisions to the CPI, which showed that inflation had been lower than previously reported.  Markets quickly pushed back the timing of future  call rate increases despite the BoJ’s assertions that the revisions  did not change its basic outlook.  Japan does have a nascent inflation-linked Japanese governm ent bond market.  The bottom right panel graphs the breakeven, which has fallen from about 1 percent to about 60 basis points.  As shown in the top panel of page 3, the entire JGB curve has shifted down since the last FOMC meeting.  One factor that has continued to work in favor of Japan’s export sector has been the exchange rate.  The ye n’s nominal value has been falling against most currencies in recent weeks and hit it s lowest level against the euro since the single currency’s launch. The middle pane l takes a much longer perspective on the yen; it graphs the real effective exchange rate since the beginning of the floating rate era. The real effective rate has been falling steadily since 2000 and is at its lowest level in more than 20 years despite the chronic trade and current account surpluses that Japan has generated in the interim. The bottom two panels on page 3 reflect th e recent volatility in commodity prices, with metal prices on the bottom left and energy prices on the bottom right.  Metal prices continue to fluctuat e but show some signs of having topped out for the time being. Energy prices, however, have made a round trip from where they were at the beginning of the year.  The retracing of prices has fed discussions about whether the so-called speculative premium in energy prices has now been taken out.  Certainly there are signs that speculators have been  exiting some of these positions.  Those signs are most visible for natural gas, whic h is something of an outlier in the bottom right. Last week’s sharp dec line in prices may have been related to the liquidation of positions by the large hedge fund that was closing out positions.  If the speculative money is being chased out, for natural ga s but also for other products, then perhaps energy prices now better reflect underlying fundamentals. Finally, I want to come back briefly to a topic I mentioned at the last meeting related to the nas cent development of an early-return fed funds market.  As background, fed funds contracts do not generall y dictate the timing of the return leg.  So, not surprisingly, most fed funds are retu rned to the lender late in the day.  The GSEs have been interested in developing an early-return facility to meet the principal and interest payment timetable given the ne w PSR (payment system risk) rules.  The data are sparse, and our conclusions are tentative, but I wanted  to give you a brief update. On page 4, the blue bar in the t op panel graphs daily volumes of regular overnight fed funds contracts. The smaller green bar represents overnight early-return volumes.  The black line shows the percentage of overall volumes represented by early returns. The time series starts on August 8, which is when data first became 5 of 132                  available to us. This series does not include term trades wi th early-return provisions.  In general, early returns make up about 10 percent of overall volumes.  The middle panel graphs the effective rate  for those trades with earl y-return provisions in red.  The blue line is the 9:00 a.m. rate.  Early- return trades are transacted in midmorning and thus show a strong correlation with the 9:00 a.m. rate, generally trading about 2 basis points below regular funds .  Finally, as shown in the bottom panel, early-return trades have far less volatility. The reason for the lower volatility is primarily that these trades are executed in midmorning ra ther than during the late afternoon rush, when the funds rate often can move with large swings.  Getting back to the GSEs, they in fact have not been active users of overnight early-return fed funds.  They have, however, used term fed funds of up to a month maturity with early-return provisions timed to mature on the date of thei r large P&I dates.  For term rates, unlike for overnight trades, there is no rate concession. Mr. Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations for the period.  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Are ther e any questions for Dino?  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. Does the early-return rate enter into the calculation of the effective rate for the day? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Yes, it does. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. It does, and therefore it affects the futures market trading. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Yes, it does affect it. Now, the e ffect that it has is fairly small—I think it’s less than 1 basis point overall. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. But should that volume rise, it could become quantitatively significant. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. That’s correct—i t could.  Again, despite forecasts by some traders and brokers in the market, so far that has not happene d.  In part, it’s because the GSEs have been using term fed funds more than ov ernight funds for cost reasons. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker. MR. LACKER. About early returns, obviously  what we care about as a Committee is the 24-hour rate. Therefore, in calcu lating and targeting that effectiv e rate, if that spread became 6 of 132            substantial, we’d want to adjust for that, I would take it.  The spread between the early return and the regular 24-hour return is so small that th e implied intraday rate in some sense that you calculate is not even close to our  daylight overdraft charges—right? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I haven’t made that precise comp arison, but in general I would say that where you started out was perhaps the most interesting part, which is that the Committee cares about the 24-hour rate. Now, that’s something that I’m  not aware has actually ever been articulated before. What has been articulate d to the Desk has been the overnig ht rate, whether that period is 24 hours, 16 hours, or some other time.  We have  thought about the question of whether the early return should be excluded, and so far we have be en analyzing it by tracking the data and trying to understand what effect it has. But if the Commit tee feels that it should be  the 24-hour rate rather than something else, then that considerat ion will have to be  taken up separately. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. From the economic standpoint, clearly we care about the 24-hour rate.  But if the intraday rate rose, and so for a give n 24-hour rate the effective overnight rate was lower, that would really distort the relationship between the e ffective rate and the longer-term real intertemporal rate of substitution. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Just to be clear, right now there is n’t an intraday rate.  This is an overnight rate, and the way that it works out, it really is roughly a 24-hour rate because most of this trading takes place in early morning to midmorning. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Even with the early returns? MR. KOS. Yes, most of the trading occurs between 8:00 and 9:30 in the morning.  It’s an early morning market for trading, and it’s an ea rly morning market for returns.  So it actually does end up being roughly a 24-hour ma rket.  It’s just that the tr ading takes place at a different part of the day. 7 of 132                   MR. LACKER. I see. But do you think of the difference as a risk premium? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. No, I don’t think it’s a risk premium.   It just reflects the 1 or 2 basis point differential for the bank. It just changes their pro cedures, so it adds to their costs in terms of returning funds earlier and not having additi onal funds to use for making other payments.  Therefore, the bank may hit against its cap earlier in the day.  So there is an economic cost, but it doesn’t seem to be a huge one. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. When you say “the bank,”  which side are you talking about? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. The bank that ’s returning the funds. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Okay. So they’re giving up so mething.  I have a second question I want to ask about inflation compensa tion.  The chart you have in the front shows that inflation compensation has fallen at the front end.  Yet in the Bluebook box on page 4, there’s a calculation done from the near-term maturi ng TIPS security showing that, from at all. Do you have a more-detailed sense about at what part of the cu rve inflation compensation has come down? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. At the short end, it’s goi ng to be affected by energy, right?   

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Right. That shows up in the Bluebook as from now to  

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Yes. Energy prices will tend to have a bigger effect dur ing the first two or three years of a TIPS curve. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. President Lacker, the thing to point out in the st aff forecast for CPI inflation is that they are forecasting dec lines in the CPI in September and October. That’s 8 of 132              reflected in the shift in the bars at the left in that box in the Bl uebook.  So it really is at the very front end. 

[SECTION]

MS. MOSSER. The numbers in Dino’s char t are breakevens, so there were no carry adjustments.  Therefore they’re not the same as the calculation s in the Bluebook, which include a lot of adjustments and are implied inflation num bers.  These are purely the differences between the nominals and the reals.  One reason that we always include the five-year five-year-forward breakeven rate is that it is the forward that is  easiest to calculate—but where energy prices and carry have the smallest effect.  So if you want to  get the clearest readi ng from pure market data, it would be the five-year five-year-forward rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. I understand and appreciate that.  Thanks.  My impression, however, is that you have something near term going on becau se of what is expected to happen to the headline CPI over the next couple of months.  Then something a couple of years out, not next year but a year or two after that, is pulling down the compensati on.  Is that a fair characterization of the market data? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. I would not be so bold as to go that far. MR. LACKER. Let me see if I can get Vince to be that bold.  [Laughter] MR. REINHART. Yes. There is someth ing happening at the n ear end.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. That’s not very bold, Vince. MR. KOS. I was willing to  go that far.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. Also, look at the relative movement.  The first five years it’s moving in a much wider range.  The five-year five-year-forward rate has come down  a bit but really not a lot. 9 of 132                 

[SECTION]

 MR. LACKER. But the near-term five-year looks as though it changed because of the next couple of months and then after ’08 and not much in ’07.  You’re okay with that interpretation? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. I’m okay with that interpretation. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Okay. Thank you. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vince, you gave me a number for two-year breakevens of 2.14 percent carry adjusted. 	 How does  that relate to these numbers? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. That was the forward rate. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The two-year  breakeven rate, carry adjusted? 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. Right. The numbers in the box are the twelve months ending in of the differential between the two yield curves.  So there are two th ings going on:  the shifting in time and the carry adjustment. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Well, the carry adjustment doesn’t affect the October ’06 calendar-year spread, nor would it affect the two-year forward rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. REINHART. If it was a forward rate, yes. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Are there other questions?  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES. Can you go back to the GSEs’ us e of the early return ?  You said they’re using the term fed funds but not the overnight.  So who is usi ng the overnight early returns? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. That’s a great question. It’s no t clear.  It seems to be a wide range of institutions. I don’t know that we’v e seen a distinct pattern yet.  Again, the sizes are pretty small as a percentage of the overall market.  I’m not quite sure why it’s being used or whether the banks are using it. There must be some cash-management aspect for which some banks are 10 of 132           using it; and perhaps some customers, for whatev er reason, are interested in getting funds back early. But I think this is one th ing that we need to understand better and one thing that we’ll be looking at in the coming months.  It’s a good question.  I wish I had a good answer for you. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES. Well, I’m just glad you’re gathering the data.   MR. LACKER. May I just follow up?  Compared with the early return, the regular fed funds loan is a 24-hour loan plus an option to extend it for a few hours.  It’s an option—you could use it or not, right?  So from  that point of view, if what we  wanted to get a bead on was the risk-free 24-hour rate, then it looks as though the early return might be the one we’d want to target rather than the other—assuming th at the market is li quid enough to do that. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. Well, the early return has to be returned early in the morning.  Also, we know anecdotally, and the data seem to support it, that  most of that tradi ng takes place roughly 24 hours before delivery. Now that’s a characterizati on of a very small segment of the market.  To have a true 24-hour market, you w ould have to presume that 10:00 a.m. trades are returned by 10:00 a.m. the next day and 11:00 a.m. trades by  11:00 a.m. the next day.  That’s a level of exactness that I’m not sure  can be replicated—or m onitored, for that matter. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Do you have a question?  All right. We need an action to ratify the open market opera tions.  Do I hear a motion? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Approved, without  objection.  Thank you. Let us turn now to the economic situation.  	 Dave? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I cannot recall the precise baseball analogy employed by David Wilcox at  the last FOMC meeting, but I have a vague recollection he speculated that I was e ither due for a forecasting hit or due to be hit by the forecast.  [Laughter] In any event, since the Greenbook was completed last Wednesday, we have made several trips to  the plate with consequential economic 11 of 132           statistics on the mound.  And how is the team doing?  I guess I =d say, better than the Washington Nationals, not as well  as the New York Mets.   Last Thursday, we received retail sale s figures for August.  As you know, we focus on the retail control component of spending, which strips out sales at auto dealers and building material and supply stor es.  The August increase in this category was 0.2 percent, a bit stronger than we had expected.  But both June and July were revised down, and on net these data were a t ouch weaker than those incorporated in the September Greenbook.  Retail inventorie s for July also were a bit below our expectation. Housing starts for August were  released yesterday.  In line with our forecast, single-family starts dropped nearly  6 percent, to 1.36 million units, and the permits data point to some further declines in the months ahead.  But multifamily starts declined somewhat more that we had expected.  If we had to redo the forecast today, we would probably lower the increase in  real GDP in the second half of this year to 1½ percent at an annual rate. Last Friday =s report that both headline and co re consumer prices increased 0.2 percent in August was right in line with  our forecast.  The major components of yesterday =s PPI actually came in below our expect ations, most especially the core finished goods index, which declined 0.4 pe rcent in August.  The only sour note was an increase in the PPI for medical services.  The PPI for medical services is used by the BEA in constructing the core PCE price index, and it caused our estimate of core PCE prices for August to revise up from a high 0.2 percent to a low 0.3 percent.  All in all, however, the incoming data ove r the past week left our forecast pretty much unscathed. I am relieved about th at, because, if I do say so myself, it =s a beautifully constructed forecast. [Laughter]  After all, with no further tightening of monetary policy, the economy eases into an extended period of slightly below-trend growth led by a retrenchment in the housing sector.  That slower  growth of activity opens a small output gap by the middle of next year but does not trigger a more precipitous cyclical contraction.  Then, as the downturn in housing wanes and the associated multiplier and accelerator effects la rgely play out, the growth of real GDP picks back up toward potential in 2008. M eanwhile, the output gap that develops over the next year or so, in combination w ith inflation expectations that remain well anchored and a near flattening out of oil and other commodity prices, is projected to impart a mild tilt down in core inflation—to 2¼ percent in 2007 and 2 percent in 2008. So, what should you make of this forecast?  Is it a construction as elegant and durable as say the Eiffel Tower in Paris, or is it more like the Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas—it looks pretty good a few blocks away but isn =t that impressive upon closer inspection?  [Laughter] In that rega rd, you could not be faulted for wondering whether this forecast represents our av eraging of two possibly more plausible outcomes that we simply didn= t have the courage to choose between. 12 of 132       One view could be that this forecast is far too pessimistic.  After all, our projection for growth in the second half of this year a nd in 2007 is now well below the consensus.  Most of the available measures of aggregate activity remain solid.  Real GDP is estimated to have increase d 3½ percent over the year ending in the second quarter, about in line with its pace ove r the past several years.  More recently, despite some notable month-to-month sw ings, manufacturing industrial production is up at a 5 percent annual rate over the three months ending in August.  An even more timely economic indicator, the level of in itial claims for unemployment insurance, has moved sideways through the middle of this month and does not yet suggest any inflection point in activity. Moreover, oil prices are down, the stock market is up, and financial conditions in the corporate sector  remain favorable.  These developments could cast doubt on our projecte d slowdown in real GDP.   The other view might be that our forecast is too optimistic.  Cyclical contractions are often precipitated by large imbalances in the economy that cause a great deal of pain and extensive damage when they ge t rectified.  Certainly, housing is looking increasingly like a sector that could play that role.  Starts and sales have dropped sharply in recent months, inventories of  unsold homes are still soaring despite cutbacks in production, and prices are rapidl y decelerating.  This jolt is occurring while households are still dealing with the substantial hit to th eir purchasing power from the higher energy prices that they have encountered over the past several years.  Yet all of this results, in our forecast, in  only a very modest and gradual rise in the unemployment rate over the forecast period.   I must admit that there were times over the past several weeks when I felt as though I =d seen this forecast before—specifically, in the summer of 1990 and in the autumn of 2000.  At those times, the staff saw that forces of restraint were in place, and we projected a noticeable shortfall of growth from potential.  But we failed to anticipate much in advance the impendi ng cyclical downturn in the economy—and I doubt that we will when such an event occu rs again in the future.  I can assure you that we spent a great deal of time examin ing both of these possible critiques of our forecast, but in the end, we still view something like our projection as more likely than either of these two alternatives.   So let me lay out the logic of the fo recast and along the way address some of these concerns.  As I noted earlier, we are now projecting the growth  of real output in the second half of the year to be arou nd 1½ percent at an annual rate, about ½ percentage point less than in the A ugust Greenbook.  The lower scheduled vehicle assemblies announced by the automakers were part of the downward adjustment.  But the major source of the projected weakness in aggregate demand lies in residential construction, which is now expected to lop off nearly 1½ percentage points of growth in real GDP in the second half. If it doesn =t really feel to you like an economy that is growing as slowly as 1½ percent, there may be a good reason.  Our assessment is that, except for the housing sector, the economy is growing at a pace of roughly 3 percent.  So far the 13 of 132        collateral damage from the downturn in hous ing has been limited, and for the most part, we expect it to remain that way, at  least for a time.  A pickup in nonresidential construction activity has offs et some of the weakness in  residential construction.  Moreover, the recent declines in energy pric es seem likely to cushion some of the near-term effects of the housing contracti on by restoring some lost purchasing power to households and by helping to support c onsumer spending.  With overall business sales holding up reasonably well so far, th e cost of capital stil l low by historical standards, and financial conditions solid, outlays for equipment should move forward at a fairly rapid clip for the remainder of the year.   But it seems implausible to us that the downturn in housing will not have multiplier-accelerator consequences that hold down growth going forward.  Along those lines, we expect empl oyment growth to slow more noticeably by the end of the year. Slower job gains and a further d eceleration in housing wealth should damp consumer spending as we move into next ye ar.  The result is a steady, though gradual, rise in the personal saving rate over the next  two years of about 2 percentage points.  With the usual lags, slower growth of sales and output cause a mild deceleration in equipment spending.  At the same time, fi scal policy is becoming progressively less stimulative over the forecast period.  These forces are attenuated, but not offset, by the boost to spending generated by a higher es timated level of labor income and by a lower trajectory of consumer energy prices in this forecast.  All told, we see these influences as likely to hold the growth of  real GDP below potential over the next two years. Still, we are not anticipating the weakening in activity to cumulate into outright recession. In our forecast, the fact that th e implications of the housing downturn for the broader economy are relatively limite d rests importantly on two suppositions, both of which are open to question. The firs t is that the slump in housing produces a sharp slowdown in house prices but not a larg e nationwide decline in  those prices.  In the past, housing prices have been relatively sticky on the downside, with homeowners resisting price cuts and keepi ng their homes on the market longer.  Our forecast envisions something similar occurring in this episode.  The second assumption is that housing wealth affects consumer spending like other forms of wealth and that there are no other channels  of influence of house prices and housing finance on consumption.  For example, we have not incorporated any significant negative effects on consumer sentiment that might accompany a rapid deceleration of house prices. We have also made no special  allowance for the d ecline in mortgage equity withdrawal to restrain consumpti on because we find the empirical evidence of such a connection to be fragile. Previ ous Greenbook simulations have demonstrated that turning on any of these channels w ould amplify the effects of a weak housing the reasons that the economy bends but doesn =t break in response to our projected housing slump. As you know from reading the Greenbook, not all of the action was on the demand side of our forecast.  In fact, we revised down aggregate supply by virtually 14 of 132     the same amount that we revised down aggregate demand, leaving the output gap nearly unchanged from the August Greenbook.  I would not be surprised if some of you were suffering a little reverse “sticker sh ock” from the low rates of GDP growth that we are now projecting, much of which can be traced to the downward adjustments that we made to potential output in each of the last two projections.  The growth of potential is estimated to be about 2¾ percent this year and next and 2½ percent in 2008. Although we still co uld be characterized as productivity “optimists” with our projection of gains in  structural productiv ity of 2¾ percent per year—a figure that is above many of the outside forecasts that we monitor—we are increasingly looking like potential output “p essimists” because of our expectation of only meager gains in available labor input.  As you know, we are projecting a steepening downtrend in labor force participation and a slowing in the working-age population as the front edge of baby-boom re tirements arrives late  in the projection period. Our views are significantly below the consensus here.  However, as we have noted in the past, if potential GDP ultimatel y proves stronger than we are forecasting, actual GDP will likely be stronger as well.  So to a first approximation, the GDP gap and the assumed accompanying path of the funds rate would be largely unaffected by errors in our forecast of potential labor input.    Much like the real side of the projecti on, our inflation forecast had some large moving pieces that, on net, left us pretty much in the same place as our August projection. On the favorable side of the le dger, oil prices are projected to average around $10 per barrel below our previous forecast.  Taken in isolation, this development would have led us to revise down our projection of core PCE prices about 0.1 percentage point next year. But there was news on the unfavorable side of the ledger as well. On the basis of un employment insurance tax records, the BEA revised up the growth in hourly labor comp ensation to an annual rate of 13¾ percent in the first quarter of the year. Once agai n, we are confronted with a huge difference between the signal provided by nonfarm busin ess compensation and the employment cost index (ECI) measure of compensati on, which increased at a rate of just 2½ percent in that quarter. Such wild discrepancies have led some inflation forecasters to employ reduced-form price equa tions that circumvent measures of labor compensation altogether.  We are sympathetic  to that approach, and those types of models are in our stable of forecasting e quations.  But we think it unwise to ignore entirely the issue of labor costs, given th at they constitute two-thirds of business costs. So what do we make of this  first-quarter jump in hourly labor compensation?  As you know, one of the principal differences be tween the two major measures is that stock option exercises are included in  the nonfarm business measure of hourly compensation but not in the ECI.  Our colleagues at the New York Fed have been monitoring data on option exercises by compan y insiders, and those data suggest that an outsized jump in exercises in the fi rst quarter probably he lps to explain an appreciable fraction of the jump in hourly compensation.  But that doesn =t seem to be the full story, as wages and salaries we re revised up in categories, such as construction, where options probably do not figure prominently in employee compensation.  In our forecast, we have a ssumed that stock option exercises and other 15 of 132             nonrecurring nonwage payments provided a tem porary boost to the level of income in the first quarter, about half of which will be reversed by the third quarter.   What about the consequences of these hi gher measured labor costs for prices? Models that take the data simply at face va lue want to revise up the forecast of core consumer price inflation forecast between  ¼ and ½ percentage point in 2007.  However, these data should not be taken enti rely at face value, at least as a measure of incremental business costs.  As we have  argued in the past, option exercises are not likely to represent a marginal cost of pr oduction and, at the very  least, are probably misleading with regard to the timing of a ny such cost increase.  Thus we have discounted the price implications of the fi rst-quarter surge in compensation per hour, adding just a tenth to our inflation forecast for this factor.  This exactly offsets the negative effects of the lower energy prices  and leaves our projection of core PCE inflation unchanged at 2¼ percent in 2007. After that, a further waning of energy a nd other commodity cost pressures, the emergence of a small output gap, and the assumption that long-term inflation expectations continue to be reasonably well behaved cause inflation to drop to 2 percent in 2008. In that regard, the better core inflation figures of the past two months, the fall in oil pr ices, and the drop in various readings on inflation expectations over the intermeeting period pr ovide us with some encouragement that inflation pressures will gradually fade over the projection period.  But we would hasten to note that none of these developments cinch the case that we have turned the corner on inflation.  Karen will continue our presentation. 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. In the international ec onomy, the striking development over the intermeeting period has been the rapid and s ubstantial drop in crude oil prices and in prices for some nonfuel commodities.  The spot price of WTI crude reached a recent high of about $77 per barrel on August 7, following news of problems with the BP pipelines at Prudhoe Bay. Since then, it ha s declined to less than $62 in trading yesterday, decreasing about $15 per barrel.  The far future s price is down somewhat less, nearly $10 per barrel, leaving a barrel of WTI crude for delivery in 2012 priced about the same as a barrel of crude in the current spot market.  As has been our practice for many year s, we have assumed for the Greenbook baseline forecast that oil prices over tim e will match those contained in the futures price curve that held when we finalized th e forecast last week.  The timing of our forecast this Greenbook and last and the sm oothing from quarterly averaging results in our forecast path for the oil import price shifting a bit le ss than did the spot price of crude. The downward revision in the oil import price amounts to nearly $12 per barrel in the near term and narrows to some what more than $8 per barrel by the end of 2007. Some other commodity markets were rema rkably volatile over the intermeeting period as well. The spot prices for gold d eclined more than $60 per fine ounce since the time of the August FOMC meeting.  Ma ny of the industrial metals also moved 16 of 132        down sharply in the past week or two, but  in some cases these declines merely retraced run-ups earlier in the intermeeti ng period and resulted in only small net changes. Regarding the implications of the lower oil prices for our forecast, it is helpful to remember that our assumed price for WTI crude  in the fourth quarter is near, but still more than $1 per barrel above, the average pr ice that prevailed in the first quarter of this year, when we regarded oil prices as ve ry elevated.  In add ition, the forecast path for WTI now rises into 2007 and then is about flat at close to $70 per barrel through the end of 2008. It also is relevant for cons tructing the forecast to ask why oil prices have come down as they have.  The new de velopments that triggered the reaction in aspects of geopolitical tensions, such as  the conflict in Lebanon and the ongoing dispute with Iran over its nuclear program, seem to have eased.  The Atlantic Ocean hurricane season has pleasantly surprised, with  fewer storms than previously expected and none so far threatening the Gulf of Mexic o.  One factor that likely influenced the price reaction to the appare nt lessening of risks to supply is the high level of inventories of crude oil at the present tim e.  Current demand and supply plus market expectations of future demand and supply combine to determine spot and future prices plus desired inventor ies.  With inventories already high, news that future supply is less uncertain sharply lowered the price required to clear the spot market and the premium that buyers are willing to pay to ensure future access to oil.  Nevertheless, the positive slope to the fu tures curve over the forecast period suggests that, on balance, market partic ipants are not expecting futu re supply to be as abundant relative to demand as is the case currently.     With respect to the implications for our forecast of foreign growth and inflation, we needed to consider the direct effect s of lower energy prices and also to ask whether actual or prospective slowing of global economic activity and, hence, demand for oil and other primary commodities have contributed to the downward shift in these prices. On balance, our ou tlook for real GDP grow th abroad generally remains quite strong.  However, we do exp ect a decrease in th e average rate of growth of foreign real GDP from about 4 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter to 3¼ percent in the second half of  this year and over the remainder of the forecast period. In both the industrial countries  and the emerging-market economies, the pace of real growth was particularly vigor ous during the first half of this year and contributed to continued st rong demand for oil and other commodities.  Monetary policy has been tightened in response to concerns of inflation and overheating in many countries, measures to tighten fiscal policy have been passed in some cases, and officials in China have imposed additiona l administrative measures to restrain growth. Prospective moderation of the rate of foreign growth was a feature of our forecast in August. Data from Canada and Japan already provide evidence of a lessening in the rate of growth in those c ountries.  However, available data on activity in the euro area, China, and Me xico continue to be buoyant.   17 of 132           In putting the pieces of the forecast together , we have concluded that the lower oil prices are consistent with overall foreign growth rema ining moderately strong and will help to ensure that it remains so.  At  the same time, the projected pace of global economic activity is consistent with oil prices remaining quite elevated and rising somewhat into next year.  We judged that the implications for foreign growth of the downward revision to the outlook for U.S. real output grow th were partly offset by some boost to foreign growth that we otherwise would have inco rporated in response to the reduced energy costs, although these factors differ acr oss countries.  As a result and given data received since the August fo recast, the path for foreign real GDP growth was little revised on balance fr om that in the previous Greenbook.   We have revised down our forecast for head line consumer price inflation abroad a few tenths for the second half of this year and next as a consequence of the lower path for energy prices. We project that in the industrial countries other than Japan inflation will move down somewhat over th e forecast period.  In contrast, Japanese inflation is expected to edge up but to remain below 1 percent.  Some emerging-market economies in Asia still have controls on or s ubsidies of domestic fuel prices, which delays any pass-through of higher energy prices into domestic inflation. Accordingly, we project that increas es in global oil prices  earlier this year will push inflation in emerging Asia temporar ily above 3 percent dur ing the first half of next year. We look for in flation in Latin America to re main contained near present rates. We see the risks to this forecast in many respects as balanced.  We have been surprised on the upside by the strength in fo reign real activity duri ng the first half of the year, and strong domestic demand in some regions could push off into the future some of the slowing that we are projecti ng.  Alternatively, fore ign activity may be more sensitive to the U.S. slowdown than we  currently envisage.  We feel especially uncertain with respect to the outlook for o il prices, given market reaction to recent events; the sharp change in prices caught us and the futures market by surprise.   Although we are once again assuming that oil prices will follow the path implied by futures prices, we recognize that a much la rger move up or down is quite possible.  David and I will be happy to answer any questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Are there questions?  President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. First, I want to congratulate David on the excellent memo on inflation dynamics, and I hope that we can circulate it more  broadly to the academic community so we can enrich that debate. It was a superb paper.   Karen, you know how much I appreciate your comments on the inflation dynamics that you’re s eeing in other countries.  I have a question on that front—really two questions. 18 of 132       First, in listening to the people that we ta lk to in the energy business, whether it’s Lee Raymond or all the operators of the various co mpanies from Exxon down to the smaller ones, I still hear the issue of how much of this price re versal—just as there was an issue of how much of the price increase—derives from speculative activity, nonphysical demand.  To summarize what I heard over the past week or so, my contacts assert that the specu lators have shifted to the short side of the boat—so that we have seen this ti lt.  I’m wondering how much  influence you ascribe to speculative activity as opposed to physical de mand and supply activity.  I know we’ve had this discussion before, but has speculation accelerated the downturn, or is there something else at play? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON. To be honest, I don’t know of any real data that the staff can bring to bear on this question. We have some data on the trading contracts and who is trading, and to some degree these data may shed light on a measur e of how much of the trading is fundamental and how much of the trading is, for want of a better word, speculative.  But that’s just nonfundamental traders, non-end users.  I don’t know that such knowledge would tell you how much of the price change is due to which sort of  activity.  My remarks this morning attempted to highlight the fact that the e ndogenous part of this behavior is the price st ructure and the inventory behavior that emerge.  I think that there was an in teraction in those things, although as yet we don’t have real formalized models of inventory behavior that  I want to claim any systematic truth about.  But I thi nk that the volume of trading and the volatili ty it might induce in prices does feed back to dema nd for actual physical product through the behavior of inventories.  So although it’s also true that th e speculative traders are adding to the upside and the downside, they are eliciting a response from the oil produ cers on the one hand and, to some degree, from the oil consumers on the other to change their in ventory behavior.  That also feeds back on how 19 of 132          the price dynamics work.  Right now, I think basica lly they are providing liquidity to this market, but they may well be amplifying the swings—but I can’t put a number on it; I really can’t. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Maybe Dino can add something? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOS. There’s probably some short-term effect.  I think there may be something to what you suggest, but my own assertion is that it would probably have a short-term effect on prices. Whether that’s a matter of days or weeks or maybe longer, it’s hard to put a time dimension on it.  I was trying to make the point in my remarks, especially about natural gas, that most people just assume that la st week’s price movements in natural gas—I believe a very sharp drop occurred on Thursday—were related to the clos eout of some of these positions from the one hedge fund, and the presumption is that other hedge funds that made  money in energy earlier this year were also getting out of some of these tr ades.  So that would support what you were saying.  Now, whether that element has an effect on prices  for a week or two weeks is very hard to know, but it probably does have some effect.  I think Ka ren is probably right in the sense that over the long term there are inventory effects, and at so me point, those speculative effects get washed out. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Well, again, it’s just somethi ng I’m interested in.  It’s not unimportant, but I have a more important question.  Karen, I noticed last week that the International Monetary Fund forecasts global economic growth, non-U.S. gr owth, of around 5 percent.  Our number is 3¼ percent. What is the difference between us ?  If we’re underestimating, what would be the policy implications? 

[SECTION]

MS. JOHNSON.  Part of the difference is the weighting that they use.  First, our number is total foreign, whereas their number is world.  However, the U.S. numbers are probably below average. If anything, we should go the other wa y, although in the past it has worked my way.  [Laughter] Second, we use weights based on U.S. export behavior.  We’re trying to construct a 20 of 132     variable that we’re going to then  put into an equation or use in thinking about the volume of U.S. exports. They’re describing global economic activ ity.  So they tend to use GDP-type weights, and we use U.S. export weights. That puts a lot of weight on Canada in our number, and Canada is on the lower side on growth, rela tive to the average.  In their case, especially if they use PPP (purchasing power parity) weight s—and I believe that they do in most of the numbers you see— that puts a lot of weight on China and China’s gr owth and more weight on China’s growth than we put. That raises their average. Thus, some  of the differences are due to differences in weights. Nonetheless, there is a real country-by-country difference in that we are on the low side of their numbers—for example, for the euro area  and certainly for the United States, although the United States isn’t in our total foreign number.  But were we going to put it in and mentally calculate some kind of average, the United States  would be a part of that story, and Europe would be another part. I guess ma ybe we’re just reading the curre nt data a little differently.  We’re not as persuaded that Europe is really going on a sustai ned growth episode.  We have Japan doing fairly well, but we have numbers in the ones and not a ny higher.  So I think we are a little bit less optimistic, if that’s  the word, about the pace at which foreign growth will continue.  We see the monetary policy actions that people have taken, we see the slowdown in the United States, and we’ve got a slower picture for the rest of the world.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Th ank you.  President Poole. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. I have an observation and a question.  Your outlook for employment is growth at just 25,000 per month.  If that’s what we ’re going to see, we’re going to have a major communication challenge to explain it because it is going to look and feel like a recession to 21 of 132        almost everybody who sees those numbers.  Ho wever, you don’t have a recession; you have continuing slow growth. So that’s just my observation. I have a question about the alternative simula tions and the market-based funds rate.  If I understand what you do, you have your baseline for ecast, and then you just impose a lower funds track, and that yields higher gr owth.  Another way of looking at the market-based funds rate is essentially to invert the Taylor rule and say how weak economic activity would have to be for the Taylor rule to lead us to cut rates.  In that case, particularly if you take a version of the Taylor rule that has a lot of interest smoothing in it, it takes a lot of downside surprises, some combination of activity and prices, to get us to reduce rates to match the market.  I just want to throw out that observation and ask wh ether you have any response to it. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Viewed from the appropr iate perspective, 25,000 per month is not too bad—viewed perhaps from the perspective of  the Administration of  Millard Fillmore.  [Laughter] So I will readily acknowledge that, if we’re right about our labor  input forecast, there will be some communication difficulties, and there will be maybe even more political consequences in some sense than underlying eco nomic consequences.  A number of you noted, and I think the Chairman noted in the tes timony or a speech, that marking down of our expectations for what would be  good underlying employment growth.  I’ve also been surprised in the past few months.  If you had told most economists or market comm entators earlier this year that 100,000 a month was going to be a good employment figure, it would have come as a real shock. Yet there has bee n, I think, a marking down of exp ectations for employment growth in that the recent figures, when they come out at 111,000 aren’t view ed as devastating. 

[SECTION]

MR. POOLE. But there’s a big difference between 100,000 and a quarter of that number.  22 of 132       

[SECTION]

 MR. STOCKTON. I completely agree.  As I indicated, this piece of our forecast does make me nervous because we are far out of the c onsensus, especially in our expectation for the ago, when we first moved to this change in our forecast, because at the time a very big question was whether there was going to be a large poo l of underutilized and unutilized workers who would come back into the labor force as the unemployment rate came down.  When the unemployment rate came down, the labor force participation rate—pretty much as we had expected—moved sideways. So I f eel a little more comfortable than  I did earlier about this piece of our forecast. But any time you are this different from everybody else, you need to be reasonably humble. As far as your observation about the market-b ased funds rate simulation, I think you are absolutely right. A different way to interpret it is to try to understand what the markets are telling us about the economy.  I would also point to another alternative simulation that I think goes a bit in the direction that  you’re suggesting—the “less infl ation persistence” simulation, in which inflation comes down more rapidly and, in essence, allows the Fed to lower the fed funds rate more significantly than we’re assuming in the ba seline in a way that’s not that different from the market’s expectation for the funds rate.  No w, that’s one possibility, or it could be some combination.  The market could be looking at some combination of a little less persistence of inflation and maybe a little weaker outlook for activity, alt hough I would wonder about the weaker market interpretation.  L ooking at the full financial conf iguration, I don’t see indications from financial markets that there’s an expectation of a lot of financial stress on our doorstep.  So I’m inclined to the view that they may be more in  that “less inflation persistence” camp than in a “much weaker economy” camp. 23 of 132          

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  Dave, I’m trying to understand your forecast and its evolution.  As I read the Gr eenbook, at least on the demand side, it seemed to be largely a housing story as you cut through everything.  So my question is, If I put myself back in August before I knew that incomes were going to be as hi gh as they were, that energy prices were going to come down, that equity values we re going to go up, an d so forth, and I plug the current view of housing into that, what would it gi ve me?  I assume it would give me  growth for the second half of this year at something cl ose to maybe 1 percent and maybe growth next year of less than 2 percent. I know that there are a lo t of moving parts, but a nyway, that is the question.   If we had known about housing and not plugged in this other stuff, where would we be? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I would say you have it just  about right—somewhere on the order of 1 percent in the second half and something certainly unde r 2 percent in 2007. Obviously, in putting our forecast together we were contending both with  weaker housing and with some of these offsets that we factored in that have pr ovided some cushion to the downside  surprise that we have had in housing through greater labor inco me, more purchasing power from lower energy prices, and a little higher stock market.  In some sens e, those effects get us back to just modestly below trend growth rather than significant ly below trend growth. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. I wanted to ask you about this “less infla tion persistence” alternative scenario, which as you said brings  inflation down to 1.6 percent by 2008.  As I read  the Greenbook and then the alternative simula tion memo, I saw two things—(1)  less persistence and (2) an expected inflation outcome of 1. 6 percent.  It seemed as thou gh that outcome wa s built into the scenario; and I was wondering, give n that we have had core infla tion over 2 percent for more than 24 of 132             two years now, whether that is a reasonable assumption to put in there.  What would the outcome look like if you had built into that scenario an assumption of 2 percent instead of 1.6 percent? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Your 2 percen t scenario is close to what  we are forecasting in the Greenbook—inflation expect ations running more lik e 2 percent than the 1½  percent, with less inflation persistence.  You are right .  We created a scenario in whic h, if you thought about some of the equation estimates that have be en presented, persistence has falle n just about to zero, in which case inflation pretty quickly reverts to what its average has been over  the past decade.  That was the basis for the “less inflation pers istence” scenario.  We obviousl y don’t think that is the most reasonable underlying assumption because we’re not forecasting that outcome; but we do think that it’s not entirely implausible and that  you ought to at least have it on  your radar screen as a possible outcome.  It highlights some of th e tension between the “l ess persistence” view of the world and the one in which we are expec ting greater persistence. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  So you assume th at there is no inflation pers istence and that we just go down to this longer-term average. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Well, by 2008.  Some costs of adjustment slow that process, so you don’t just jump immediat ely to the 1½ percent. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. So it is just ba sed on the assumption, and the key is that assumption of 1½ percent or 2 percent. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. It is more than an assumption: It’s an  assumption that could be defended with some empirical evidence.  Again, in some of these in flation persistence regressions in very short sample periods, there is evidence that th e persistence has fallen very  close to zero.  Taken at face value, that could produce an outcome quite similar to what we are cal ling the “less inflation 25 of 132         persistence” scenario.  As you k now from reading our memo, we do not think that is probably the best starting point for your consideration, but we  do not think it is implausible or unreasonable. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. I would like to compliment you, David Stockton, and your staff for inclusion in this meeting’ s Greenbook, Part 2, on page II-36, of an array of  measures of inflation expectations, apparently in response  to needling from me.  I can assu re you that this will have no moral hazard effect, and you will get neither no more nor no less n eedling in the future than you would have.  So this is not going to encourage more needling.  I think that effort will help going forward, and I look forward to more steps in this direction.   You just mentione d in response to President Moskow that close to 2 percent expected inflation u nderlies the Greenbook’s baseline forecast, and that is usef ul information.  I also want to compliment you on  the documentation about inflation dynamics.  I thin k that will be useful groundwork fo r us on the Committee.  What I hope we do in the next year or so as part of the Kohn subcommittee deliberati ons on communications is to come to some understanding of how the patte rn that guides our conduct—call it a rule or systematic component of moneta ry policy—relates to inflation dynamics and to discuss what inflation dynamics we want to bring about. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Mishkin. 

[SECTION]

MR. MISHKIN.  First, on this issue of persistence, I want to mention that I think we should have some caution about interpre ting the results.  I do not quite kno w what the word “persistence” means because this is really a ve ry reduced form estimate.  A key issue is what mean it is that inflation is reverting to, and that  can very much depend on what  we do in terms of managing expectations.  It is completely reasonable for you to have done the simulation that you call “less 26 of 132                  inflation persistence,” but I might call it something different.  So just I think that’s important to think about. What I would like you to do is to actually go  a little beyond the forecas t.  I’d like to know what your thinking is on 2009, maybe 20 10.  I know you’re going to be a little uncomfortable about doing so because there is clearly a lot of uncertainty.  However, when  I think about wh at the state of the economy is and how we should do monetary policy, we need to look at longer periods.  So I am not going to hold you to it  and say, “Gee, you have to be able to give us a great forecast,” but I would actually like to know at least what your thinking may be on that issue. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I am flattered that you asked, given that I am  still trying to  figure out what happened in the first quarter of this year.  [Laught er]  So let me answer your question first and then provide some of the caveats  or background.  Basically, we do construct something we call a Greenbook extension that goes bey ond the current Greenbook horizon of 2008.  We do that for two reasons. One is that we have to forecast long-term interest rates, and we also have to be thinking a bit about where the ec onomy is going, and we us e that extension to help inform our thinking.  We also use it in some of the analytical  tools that we provide to the Committee, such as the optimal control exercises that we re port from time to time.   There is a logic for the Greenbo ok’s current forecast pe riod:  Most of what  we are doing in macroeconomic forecast ing is trying to get some purchase w ith a few gross correlations in the data and their dynamics, and a forecast period through the end of 20 08 pretty much lets those dynamics play out. Beyond that, the Greenb ook extension is what I call a mode l-informed constr uction.  I had actually hoped a few years ago that we could start presenting this more frequ ently.  My model staff wisely persuaded me not to do it yet.  The reason is that the longer-run extension—for example, of what the equilibrium real rate is going to be in 2009, 2010, or 20 11—in a model as large as FRB/US 27 of 132       often changes for obscure reasons.   For example, it may change wh en we re-estimate the energy production equation.  In that case, all of a sudden we may get a ¼ poin t change in the equilibrium real rate that takes us a week to figure out why it happened, and ultimately the explanation would probably seem unsatisfyi ng to you.  We have be en working on a project over the past year to systematize the rules that we use in constructing that lo nger-term outlook so th at we could present it to you and have more conf idence that when we do that we could both understand it ourselves and explain it to you.  So I think what you are looking for is  something that is high on our agenda. Now, if we had to talk about 2009 and 2010 , we are ending this forecast period with a modest output gap.  That output gap would, all else being equal, be pushing inflat ion down from the 2 percent range with which we end up in this forecast to something below 2 percent.  So you would be on track with that.  But when you construct these lo nger-term ranges, the first thing you will encounter is the need for a dollar forecast.  Over the length of  the Greenbook period, Karen can talk about a dollar forecast that is roug hly a random walk with a little bi t of a nod in the direction of some depreciation.  When we constr uct a ten-year extension of the fore cast, we actually have to take a very precise stand on that.  In these Greenbook extensions, right afte r the end of 2008, we basically have to build in somethin g like a 4 percent real exchange rate depreciation of the dollar.  Then in the extension, even th ough we are running with an unemployment rate of roughly 5¼ percent, we are not getting any further disinflation  out of it because that outp ut gap is just offsetting the inflation consequences of th e anticipated dollar depreciation. So if I were to charac terize the forecast a few steps beyo nd the end of the current Greenbook forecast, it would be one in which you have  a positive output gap, maybe a 5¼ percent unemployment rate, and not really making much progress beyond the 2 percent inflation with which we end the forecast period. 28 of 132

 MR. MISHKIN.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you very much.  Dave, I f ound your discussion of the averaging to be interesting—that is, the forecast is between the devil and the deep blue sea or, in effect, between recession or much slower growth on the one side and mo re inflation with perhaps higher growth on the other side. It reflects what I have been goi ng through mentally and th e discussion we had at some length with our staff in Boston yesterday. Just focusing on the potential- for-recession side, when is it that we have had drops in residential investment such as the ones that yo u are projecting (which ar e quite unusual looking across the whole range of forecasts, particularly for this year) in the absence of a recession?  I think the material from the briefings suggested that the drop is about the same as ’90-’91, which was a recession, and not quite as bad as  ’80-’82, which was a big recession.  When have we seen that outside a recession? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I think the answ er to that is probably never in the post-World War II period. We also have not had a rise in the unem ployment rate of ½ percentage point stretched out over a year, as we have in this forecast, without running into a recession.  

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. That us ually happens faster. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. From our perspective—I haven’ t said this in years,  so I allow myself this one time—there is more uncerta inty at this point.  Both tails of the distribution feel wider to me than they have in the past.  Now,  my having said that, is it impossible to imagine that we could have something that we haven’t seen previously—a decline in housing of  20 to 30 percent and a modest rise in the unemployment rate?  I think you would have to say that over the past six years the economy has shown remarkable res ilience and an ability to absorb so me pretty signi ficant shocks 29 of 132      without triggering a cyclical downtu rn.  So it is not impossible for me  to imagine that  we will again in this period.  Monetary policy is obviously no t currently pushing hard into the cycle—that is, exacerbating the downturn as it wa s in the early 1980s.  With the drop in energy prices and the generally sound financial conditions that we see in  the corporate sector, there are some reasons for thinking there is a reason ably solid base upon which this shock is going to occur.  But having said that, I think th e situation is uncomfortable. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  The behavior of construction th at we are projecting is unusual, but the predicate is also unusual in that we did go th rough a mild recession bu t with substantially no attenuation in the pace of construction.  So it is an  unusual path that we foll owed to get here, and in our baseline forecast, it is an unusua l path that we fo llow going forward. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  It is interestin g that, when you plot out all the other major forecasts and you look at the underlying elements of them an d you look at GDP, inflation, and so forth, the Greenbook is really an outlier on the low side in terms of growth and the fed funds rate.  Maybe you are right. You have  been here before as an ou tlier from the rest of  the mainstream forecasts.  I wish I had a good sense of how all of that worked out. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON.  Sometimes right and sometimes wrong.  [Laughter] I do have a sense of that. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  I figured  you might, you know. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. Part of the difference stems increasingly from our mo re pessimistic take on potential output.  Many of those outside for ecasts have the unemployment rate rising to 5 percent, and we have it rising a bi t more.  Some of that difference is greater cy clical weakness that I would attribute to the depth of the housing downturn that we  are forecasting.  Bu t some of it is just that we see potential outpu t as very weak as well.  That exagge rates or has the po tential to create a 30 of 132          GDP illusion in comparing the fo recasts, where we look much, much weaker even though our output gap isn’t that much larger.  For what it is wo rth, in the past week I have seen more people who do a serious tracking of the economy moving toward our outlook rather than away from it.  So it wouldn’t surprise me if more  outside forecasters weren’t show ing not somethin g as weak as 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. One small thing.  On the other side of the de vil and the deep blue sea, there is such a sharp contraction of residential investment, which lasts ba sically for a year and a half—the forecast does attenuate the rate of decline into ’07, but the contractio n lasts pretty much a year and a half from where we are.  Could it be faster?  Could builders see that it is in their best interest to stop building now so th at prices do not go down on new homes faster than they have gone already and inventories do not build anymore.  Could that contr action be shorter, and could we come out of it faster? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. The answer to th at is “yes,” and I think ther e is some risk.  One feature of our forecast is the fa ct that we are not projecting large decl ines nationwide in house prices.  We are expecting a deceleration but not any outright declines.  One co uld imagine that more of the adjustment could take place more qu ickly by a big drop in house prices  that in some sense clears out that inventory through higher sale s and maybe less produc tion adjustment.  On that side, you would probably get a quicker housing cycl e than the one that we are projecting.  However, it also brings with it some downside risk in that households would realize how much their net worth had fallen, which could have consequences for consumption both directly through the wealth effect and perhaps through sentiment.  Th at correction could be quicker and maybe deeper, but then the rebound could be fast er.  That is a risk  we have certainly contempl ated.  We were a little nervous about being too adventuresome on th e house-price forecastin g.  We are not very good at forecasting 31 of 132               asset values, we never understood ho w prices got as far out of alignm ent as we think they are, and we are not sure exactly what the process of correction is going to look like.  So we have taken a middle stance between two models:  one model th at basically forecasts house prices off pure momentum and another one that takes seriously th e analytical apparatus, which we showed you a year and a half ago at our special briefing on housing, that looks at the error-correction process of house prices to rents.  The latte r model actually does forecast outr ight declines nationwide in house prices by 2008.  We are between a momentum model, which expects house prices to slow less than we are forecasting, and this  error-correction model, wh ich shows bigger declines. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN. I was not really suggesting that there would be  major price h its but only that the contraction that you are showing in the near term in residential construction might be enough, given mortgage rates, demo graphics, and those kinds of thing. 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. In some sense our forecast is below our mo dels.  Our models still say that the fundamentals in terms of cost of capital and income are reasonably supportive of residential investment. We thought we  actually created so me possibility of upside surp rise with our forecast as well and not just downside  in the adjustments that we made to our forecast. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  That is exactly what I was trying to get at.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. If ther e are no more questions, we ’re ready for the economic go-around.  For the benefit of ou r new member, the conve ntion is that you ra ise one hand to be recognized and be put in the queu e; if you have a comment or qu estion, raise two hands for an intervention.  I’ve noticed that there have not been a lot of two-handed interventions, particularly on one-day meetings, when we don’t ha ve much time.  It is perfectly sensible to take account of the time, and that is fine; but if you do have an important intervention, by all means, don’t hesitate.  We start with President Poole. 32 of 132          

[SECTION]

 MR. POOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m going to be quite brief.  My contacts in the transportation industry are giving off some very mix ed signals.  UPS is inves ting heavily in capacity expansion.  They have a problem in expanding cap acity because they tradit ionally do it by buying used passenger aircraft.  There ar e very few of these large aircraft  around.  They are expecting a busy holiday season.   My contact in the trucking industry says that  his firm is now contracting.  They have canceled orders for heavy trucks, the rest of them  for delivery this year, and I found these numbers quite interesting.  He gave me the heavy truck purchases; these are the big, over-the-road, heavy trucks. I will read you the numbe rs from 2003 through 2006: 2,825; 3,377; 2,4 24; and 2,672.  Their planned truck purchases for next year  are 250, and they have  canceled the orders for the rest of this year.  So the contraction is dramatic, and they have actually been reducing capacity. My Wal-Mart contact said that it’s a bit hard to read the most recent data.  They work entirely on a year-over-year basis.  Last year was heavily distorted by the hurricane season, and he said that the latest weekend was a bit disappoint ing.  The paycheck cycle that they look at to understand their customers’ liquidity  situation is very mu ted, apparently with lower gasoline prices taking pressure off the b udgets of many of their cust omers.  He said that, fo r the first time he can remember, they have dropped the construction of  new stores; they’ve actually canceled seven or eight projects because of high construction co st increases, which have been running in the neighborhood of 15 percent year ov er year.  They are having no prob lem in finding la bor, and he is not reporting any particularly great price pressu res.  I had already commented earlier about my concern about what these employment  numbers are going to mean, and so I won’t repeat that point.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Moskow. 33 of 132              

[SECTION]

 MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My contact calls and director reports this round point to moderate growth in overall economic activity.  Both nationally and in our District, housing is weak.  Domestic  auto production is slowin g from last year, but activity in other sectors remains on a so lid footing. Starting on the downside, one of our Detro it directors from Pulte Ho mes characterized the slowdown in housing as broad and d eep, and he said that they face a rocky road for the next year or two. With regard to motor ve hicles, GM noted that their lower production in the fourth quarter largely reflected the retoo ling of five plants for their new truc k platform, reduced low-margin sales to rental fleets, and lowered desired inventory holdi ngs by dealers because of higher interest rates. Both GM and Ford are trying to reduce their reliance on sale s to rental fleets. In contrast, a wide array of capital goods ma nufacturers reported continued strong growth.  The two major temporary he lp firms headquartered in the Dist rict pointed to modest but steady growth in billable hours.  Impor tantly, no contact was worried abou t a protracted slowdown in the economy. Indeed, my directors were  quite optimistic.  Th is is an important change from six weeks ago, when we were hearing co mments that the expansion had become long in the tooth and concerns that we were headed fo r a period of sustained weakness.  This more upbeat assessment was in line with the sentiments I heard at the International Manufacturin g Technology Show, which was held in Chicago earlier this month with over 90,000 attendees  from more than 100 countries.  Now, I did not have a chance to talk to all of them, [laughter] but  the ones I did ta lk to were quite optimistic about increasing demand for U.S.-made high-tech capital equipment.  The most amazing and impressive new technology that I saw was someth ing that looked like a la rge ink-jet printer, but it spit out metal du st to fabricate intricate parts without tradition al tools or dies. This was really quite unusual and impressive. 34 of 132         Turning to inflation, there was little change in most reports regarding pric e pressures.  Labor compensation continued to increase at elevated rates.  Our contacts  from temporary help firms noted a further step-up in wages for hi ghly skilled workers, wher eas our retail contact said he was paying 8 to 10 percent more for entry-level sales personnel.  Of course, the energy picture on the cost side looks better.  Several contacts expressed relief at th e recent declines and hope d that they would lead to reductions in fuel surcharges and related costs. Turning to the national outlook, we agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that growth in the third quarter appears to be so mewhat weaker than we anticipa ted at the time of the August meeting. However, in co ntrast to the Greenbook, we do not think the sluggishness will persist for long. Current financial c onditions do not ap pear to be a restraint on ac tivity.  Labor markets are in good shape, so growth in jobs and wages should continue to suppo rt household spending.  We are getting a welcome boost to real incomes from lower energy pric es; and given the increase in business optimism that I noted earlie r, I am less concerne d that cautious animal  spirits will cause businesses to pull back on spen ding.  Housing remain s the major downside risk, but I get the impression that thus far the weakness in residen tial investment is  not spilling over  to the other sectors of the economy.  Of course, we have talked about this at great length. So our overall assessment  is that by early next  year growth w ill be much closer  to potential than the Greenbook projects .  Accordingly, we  do not think that  any meaningful re source ga ps will emerge to restrain inflation.  In deed, our inflation models based on  data since 1967  look for core PCE inflation to be 2.7 percent in ’07 and 2.6 percent in ’08.  The models that use data only since 1984 come out somewhat lower, at 2.4 in ’07 an d 2.3 in ’08. In thinking about the differenc es between these forecasts, I fo und the background paper that Dave circulated quite useful, as several others have  said.  Our models allow for permanent shocks to 35 of 132           the level of inflation, and as the paper noted, such shocks appear to have been much smaller since 1984. But as also discussed in the paper, we  have no way of knowing whether these permanent shocks will be small in the futu re.  I think the most likely interpretation of the reduction in the volatility of these permanent shoc ks is that policy has done a better job of  anchoring inflation expectations. The public is more convinced than they were in the past th at we will maintain low and stable inflation.  Bu t if our actions fail to c onfirm this belief, we woul d lose credibility, leading to higher inflation expectations and imparting more pers istence to the current inflation shock.  An inflation shock that is pe rmanent rather than  transitory is our responsibility. Our forecasts remind me of  this risk.  True, so fa r this is just a risk.  We have not yet seen any broad-based increases in long-run inflation fo recasts by private-sector economists or in the five-year to ten-year TIPS inflation compensation.  Indeed, TIPS have even  moved down recently.  This news is welcome.  But even if inflation expe ctations have not moved u p, another concern is the level of long-run inflation expectat ions—and I thought Jeff Lacker rais ed a good point last time in reminding us about it.  Long-run inflation expectations of aro und 2½ percent for the CPI translate into a core PCE rate well above the middle of my comfort zone of  1 to 2 percent.  Even the Greenbook expects core PCE inflation to be above 2 percent throug h ’08.  I am concerned that even now the public could be questioning our resolve to bring inflation into what many of us have said is our comfort zone.  I am already hearing this sentim ent from some market analysts.  Even without an increase in expectatio ns, it is not clear to me that inflation will settle back to a level that I view as being consistent with price stab ility without further policy action. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Presid ent Moskow, going back to the automobiles, you mentioned the retooling.  The Gree nbook has reduced production plans for the second half.  Is that what you heard? 36 of 132           

[SECTION]

 MR. MOSKOW. Yes, and Chrysl er announced just yesterday that they, too, are reducing production in the second half.  What intrigued me about GM, which has lo wered production plans, is the changeover for light trucks.  They are producing these trucks in five plants, and that is the largest number of plants that pr oduce one type of vehicle.  As a result, when th ey change these plants, they do it sequentia lly; the changeover slows production in that plant.  Then they ramp up, and it takes some time to ramp up.  Then they go to the next plant and do the same thing.  So they are going through a series of five  plants, and that in itself lowers  their production in the fourth quarter.  The other things I me ntioned would lower it as well. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, the Eleventh Dist rict economy remains strong and continues to grow at a stronger pace than  the rest of the country, with employment growth continuing at roughly twice the nation’s pace.  Incidentally, home sales have not  turned down in our District, so we haven’t been singing yet what we call the “coastal bl ues” as far as the hom ebuilding market is concerned. I think that’s enough said about Texas and the Eleventh District.   I would like to talk about what I have learned this time from  my usual soundings of some two dozen CEOs and CFOs.  I have added a new one , by the way—the largest truck dealer in the country, which does $2.8 b illion in sales of heavy truc ks.  Just as a footnote, what is driving some of what President Poole reported are the changes in emission standards that are being enforced as of To summarize the reports of these interlocutor s, I am going to borrow from Mark Twain’s great quip about the music of Wagner.  According to these business contacts, the outlook for economic growth is better than it  sounds, whereas the dy namic of inflation is worse than it sounds. 37 of 132           Just a few anecd otes here for, if not similitude, verisi militude.  By th e way, all the interlocutors are fully aware of the shape of th e yield curve—these indivi duals are sophisticated— and they are especially aw are of what is happening in the hous ing market.  As on e CEO told me, the only subject that has been more analyzed than the h ousing situation is  the birth of Brad Pitt’s baby.  [Laughter]  According to this view, if we have not discounted what ha s been happening in the housing market, we have been living on Mars, and I think that is an important point to take into account.  If you re member, Dave, I have been more pessimistic than the staff in terms of the depth of the housing downturn.   Well, very quickly, according to the CFO of Frito-Lay, he and his counterpart CFOs in consumer goods companies do not see an appreciable slowing of growth from  the second quarter to the third quarter.  The CFO of UPS reports that, while  business is tougher, third-quarter growth is running at a rate of 3 percent, th e same as the second quarter, and th eir business projections indicate GDP growth “in the high 2 percen t or low 3 percent area ” for the rest of th e year.  The CEO of Burlington Northern Santa Fe repor ts that, despite a 17 percent year-over-year falloff in lumber shipments through last week, busines s overall “has actually firmed si nce the second quarter.”  From my usual report on the Panamax shipping charter rates, it is noteworthy that since ou r last meeting, when the round-trip booki ng rate was $23,000 a day, the rate has soared to $31,000 a day.  By the way, the rates for carrying back finished products like steel fr om China, in the so-called handymax fleet, has risen to $27,300 from $23,000 a day, where it was at our last meeting. All the retailers I talked to—from 7-Eleven to  JCPenney to Costco to Home Depot—report that they feel that they have bot tomed out and that things are pickin g up, with one exception.  That exception is Wal-Mart, and I think so me of that situation relates to the internal dynamics of the way Wal-Mart is positioning itself in  the market.  I think Bill’s report was very accurate on Wal-Mart. 38 of 132           There are some temperin g contra-indicators.  The book-to -bill ratio for Te xas Instruments and other semiconductor firms has fallen to 1 or sl ightly below, and advanced bookings for airlines are somewhat weaker.  Herb Kelle her of Southwest Airlines, who ha s to be the most entertaining interlocutor I talk to, te mpered that by saying when we met last time the advanced booking curve “index” was, say, 100.  It ha s now eased to somewhere around 95—a noticeable but not dramatic drop. The CEO of EDS summari zed the growth side of  the economy mu ch as did the majority of the CEOs I spoke to for this go-round when he said, “We were all ex pecting things to be worse.  They haven’t gotten worse.”   They were all expectin g things to get tougher, and they haven’t gotten tougher, except for one area—the procurement of labor.  There is a shortage of bank tellers and mechanics. By th e way, a wrench bender, as  they call the job in California now—a simple mechanic without the comp letion of a high-school diploma—ge ts $100,000 a y ear.  There is a shortage of truck drivers, of oil field hands, of chemical engineer s, and even of unskilled workers such as retail store cashiers in Ho uston; and for the first time I have heard from the major hoteliers of a shortage of hotel maids.  To illustrate the point, one CEO mentioned that, whereas his company regularly used to get 300 applicati ons for 100 truck driver jobs, they  now get 3.  So the bottom line is that our contacts are feeling mo re optimistic than th e economists’ forecasts.   They are worried about some constraints on domes tic labor.  As one contact sai d, the economy fe els like a full employment economy. I want to spend just a minute on  the inflation picture.  I’m no t going to go th rough anecdotes from the CEOs, though it pains me greatly as the son of an Australian to no te that Anheuser-Busch has told its retailers that it is go ing to raise the price of  beer 3 percent starting in January 2007.  But I do want to explain why our board voted 7 to 1 to raise the discount rate.  As you kn ow, we measure 39 of 132         inflation at the Dallas Fed by the trimmed mean.  Ou r numbers show tri mmed mean inflation running at 3.1 percent in July and a twelve-month rate of 2.7 percent and, not unimportantly, with 57 percent of the component elements  increased at a rate of 3 percent or more.  Now, of course, we cannot update those numbers until the next PCE number comes out, so you might ar gue that they are very stale.  But the recent CP I release was not comforting.  Da ve, you mentioned 0.2 percent.  Taking that at face value, you can say that consumer inflation is  unchanged from July.  But if you really look at those numbers, the rate for July was 0.19 percent, and the rate for August was 0.24 percent.  If you annualiz e those numbers, that is a difference between 2.36 percen t and 2.9 percent. So we need to keep in mind that the August CPI reading is about midw ay between July’s low reading and the elevated readin gs over the previous four months.  At an annual rate of roughly 3 percent, it is better th an earlier this year, but it is still uncom fortable.  I take President Moskow’s point about our credibility,  particularly against th e background of the tr immed mean, Cleveland’s median rate of 3.4 percent, and then our six-month trimmed mean ra te running at about 2.9 percent, I believe.  I mention th is simply to urge the Committee that —not only in our deeds, to take President Moskow’s point, but also in our wo rds—we need to continue engendering confidence about inflation expectations and be very careful in the way we state our selves.  We cannot take it for granted that inflation has been completely  conquered.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. You men tioned a third-quarter estima te of about 3 percent? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  That was the UPS estimate, yes, sir. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I am just curious.  The third quarter will be ov er in ten days.  Given the data that we have already seen, what woul d you estimate is th e range of standard deviation around the current running estimate?  If you are looking at the thir d quarter, which is over 40 of 132          shortly, we have seen at most tw o-thirds of the data we  are going to see.  Wh at is the approximate range of error would you say in term s of estimating the current quarter? 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. It is still vague. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Still pretty larg e.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. STOCKTON. I want to say something on the order of ¾ pe rcentage point.   Just the revisions in the data are not too different from that. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, if I may, again, this is just one source of data.  They happen to be in a business that is, I think, particularly in teresting.  In preparation for the last m eeting, they were talking about a number closer  to 3 percent than th e original estimate before the revision, and they proved to be quite accurate.  But I want to make  sure I was clear.  Th e CFO was saying that their third quarter is running at a 3 percent growth rate—the same as the second quarter in their business—and their estimate for GDP growth in the f ourth quarter is in the high twos or low threes. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Th ank you.  Pres ident Yellen. 

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our  last meeting, the data bearing on the near-term economic outlook suggest both slower econo mic growth and a bit less  core price inflation going forward.  In terms of ec onomic activity, the recent news has been uniformly negative, resulting in a significant downward revision to gr owth in the Greenbook.  Indeed, compared with the outlook of other forecasters, the Greenbook’s pr ojection of real GDP grow th for the second half of this year is quite pessimistic; it would now rank  in the lower 5 percent tail of the distribution of individual Blue Chip forecasters.  I think this pessimism is not completely unfounded, however, largely because of my worries about the housing sect or.  The speed of the fa lloff in housing activity and the deceleration in house prices continue to surprise us.  In the view of our contacts, the data lag reality, and it seems a good bet that things will get worse before th ey get better.   41 of 132        A major homebuilder who is on one of our boards tells us th at home inventory has gone through the roof, so to sp eak.  [Laughter]  He liter ally said that.  With th e share of un sold homes topping 80 percent in some of the new subdivisions around Phoeni x and Las Vegas, he has labeled these the new ghost towns of  the West.  In fact, he described th e situation at a re cent board meeting in Boise.  He had toured some new subdivisions on the outskirts of Boise and disc overed that the houses, most of which are unoccupied, are now being dressed up to  look occupied—with curtains, things in the driveway, and so  forth—so as not to discourage potential buyers.  The general assessment is that this overhang of speculative inventory implies that permits and starts will continue to fall. Invent ory ratios will rise, and th e market probably will not recover until 2008.  So far, builders remain hesitant to cut prices, fearing that doing so will cause a surg e in cancellation rates on sold but unfinished ho mes.  However, builders now rou tinely offer huge incentives, and price cuts appear inevitabl e.  We have been following the Case Schiller house-price index, which is based on house-price data in ten large urban markets,  three of which are in Ca lifornia.  Beginning in prices will be falling at an annual rate of about 6 percent by the end of this year.  Of course, trading in this new futures ma rket is still somewhat thin, but it is a signal that we need to keep a very close eye on the incoming data and watch whether the housing slowdown is turn ing into a slump. Turning to inflation, core me asures of consumer price in flation remain well above my comfort zone, but the latest readings on consumer prices have be en modestly bette r.  Unlike the Greenbook, I think the outlook for inflation has actually improved a bit since our last meeting largely because of the recent drop in commodity and crude oil prices.  The relief on energy prices is, of course, very welcome, but we do  have to be careful not to overestimate the extent to which past energy price pass-through has been  boosting core inflation.  For example, airfares might seem like 42 of 132          an obvious case in which outsized consumer pri ce increases reflect energy  price pass-through.  However, our staff recently calculated the share of jet fuel costs to total ai rline operating expenses and estimated that the jump in thos e costs likely accounted for less than half the ri se in airfares this year.  Instead, airfares may reflect strong demand and constraine d capacity as indicated by very high airline passenger load factors.  S till it seems likely that energy pass-through has played at least some role in the run-up of  core inflation this year, so  any energy price pressure on  core inflatio n is likely to dissipate over time. Now, as David noted, the Greenb ook has completely offset th e favorable effects on core inflation from lower energy prices by boosting the growth rate of labo r costs.  In contrast, I attach a little less weight to the recent data on co mpensation per hour.  My gu ess is that most of the difference between hourly compensation and the ECI does relate to profit-linked items like bonuses and stock options, and that suggests to me th at marginal costs of production are not rising significantly faster.  Even if they are, it remain s true that markups are hi gh.  So with sufficient competitive pressures, firm s have room to absorb cost increases without fu lly passing them into prices. Finally, I want to add my compliments to those of others  to the Board’s staff for a very interesting analysis of inflation dynamics and monetary po licy.  As I mentioned at our last meeting, it may be unduly pessimistic to assume that the rece nt rise in inflation will be highly persistent.  Over the past ten years, estimated reduced-form m odels suggest that core in flation generally returns to its sample average after severa l quarters.  Recently our staff examined persistence at a more disaggregated level and found that  the same general pattern also  holds for each of the major components of the core PCE pric e index, with price inflation fo r durables only slightly more persistent than price inflation for nondurables and se rvices.  In the current situation, this suite of 43 of 132             regressive models indicates that core PCE inflation should fall to just belo w 2 percent by the middle of next year.  I am not quite as optimistic as thes e simple models, but on ba lance my concerns about the inflation outlook have been slight ly alleviated by recent developments. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you very  much, Mr. Chairman.  New England continues to grow modestly, though recent da ta suggest that some cau tion is warranted.  Dist rict employment growth remains slower than  that of the nation.  Most states in the region are back to their January ’01 levels of employment; but the largest st ates, Massachusetts an d Connecticut, are not.  The Philadelphia Fed indexes of overall state activity, which are based largely on employment- and wage-related data, suggest sluggish growth as well, with Maine and Massachusetts at or  near the bottom of the index for the country as a whole.  Even with slow  labor growth, certain cat egories of positions are very hard to fill—in particular, finance, accounting, certain IT specialties, e ngineers, biotech, and skilled labor for manufacturing.  In fact, one large aircraft ma nufacturer was quoted as saying that the labor situation as far as he was concerned was insane.  Cost s for acquiring certain kinds of labor are rising, but in general, we ar e not seeing increases across the board in overall expected labor costs.  But given the kinds of labor that are very  much an important part of the businesses in the First District, such increas es may not be far off. Housing markets are clearly contracting.  We are part of the co astal situation.  Through the second quarter, New Englan d house prices escalated at only half the pace of the United States as a whole, and home foreclosures , while still fairly low, ticked up more significan tly in the region than elsewhere.  Permits have fallen sharply, down 25 percent from last year and 22 percent from the year before, though yesterday’s starts data were  a bit better for the Nort heast than elsewhere.  Slower building is leading suppliers of housing product s to project declining business later this year 44 of 132         as their sales tend to lag a decline in residential real estate markets.  Consumer confidence for the region as a whole dropped off at a faster pace than  elsewhere in the nation in August compared with the year before. So there are all thos e reasons for caution about the growth rate of the New England economy, but not all the data are bad.  Consumer prices, in gene ral, are escalatin g more slowly, even though energy costs are hi gher.  Downtown and suburban offi ce vacancy rate s are down, and rents are rising.  Hardware and software businesses that were contacted or that are represented on our small-business advisory group report fairly st rong revenues and definite concerns about costs.  Business confidence measures an d surveys were positive both for Massachusetts and Connecticut, reflecting profitable trends and stronger sales an d even some strength in manufacturing.  As I mentioned at our last meeting, the growth in personal income in th e region, despite slow job growth, is on a par with that of the natio n.  Reflecting this and strong corporate profits, state income, sales, and corporate tax revenues are up, in some cases by relatively large percentages.  So even though we have some reasons to be concerned about New England, not everything is negative—though that is sort of hard to find in the local media and yo u certainly will not  hear the politicians talking about it either. Turning to the nation, I would agree that most incoming data  since our last meeting have been on the subdued side.  Auto sa les, trade data, and certa inly anything to do with residential real estate markets have been more su bdued than was expected.  Of c ourse, price measures have been subdued as well, at both the headlin e and the core levels.  But like New England, not everything is slow. I would look at employment growth as fairly solid, even though it has slowed from the beginning of the year.  The surpri se in wage and salary  income may reflect la rgely the exercise of stock options, but it could also re flect some pressure on  overall wage costs because hiring certain 45 of 132            kinds of workers is getting difficult.  Oil prices are down, and gasoline price declines act as a kind of bonus to the consumer.  Consumer spending isn’t too bad.  The latest reta il sales data aren’t bad at all; and although confidence bo unces around a bit, it seems to have recovered—at least as much as gasoline prices have recovered.  Industrial pr oduction seems pre tty good, with strong growth in some equipment categories.  Business profits are good.  Orders and shipme nt data suggest that business spending is solid.   I am sort of repeating everythi ng you said, David, and I probab ly should not do that.  But I seem to be at the same  point as people you me ntioned in your presen tation might  be—a little shocked by the slowness of expected GDP over the next couple of quarters.  In fact, when we in Boston look at our baseline forecast, it is a good  deal more optimistic la rgely because we are not seeing as much of a decline in residential investment.  I found th e briefing yesterday to the Board interesting, when you tracked your own forecast of residential inve stment.  At one time we were lower than you were, but you far su rpassed us.  In fact, with your decline 50 percent greater than ours in ’06 and quite a bit larger again in ’07, we get a GDP that is 0.3 percentage point higher in ’06 and almost 1 percentage point higher in ’07.  We also see a lower NAIRU,  and we have a bit higher estimate of potenti al—so it does not affect the gap as mu ch, but it does affect the headline number of GDP.  I understand all the mechanics, but the staff forecast is lowe r than most private forecasts.  I wonder, if growth is  that low for that long, whether it might set off a chain reaction of actually higher saving rates than  you project and lower confidence  that could feed back more strongly than you have anticipat ed.  In that regard , I found the recent es timates of a rising probability of recession interestin g.  I do not think we’r e going to have a rece ssion, but I do wonder about it if, in fact, we do  realize the slow growth of the Greenbook forecast. 46 of 132                However, how much do we real ly know about how long residential inve stment will stay negative without a recession?  Mortgage rates are not  up that much—only 50 ba sis points or so from the beginning of the year.  Income s are rising, and nonhousing wealth is risi ng.  At some point, buyers should recognize that housing has gotten more affordable and resume desired purchases, perhaps without further major price declines.  Cert ainly speculative building is off, and investors have backed out of contracts, bu t how much more of that really will occur?  The Greenbook would suggest another year and a half, but shouldn’t builders be acting quickly now to reduce the amount of overbuilding and to preserve price levels? Underlying demographics  and other fundamentals have not changed either. So it is hard actually for me to see that residentia l investment will be that hard hit that long. I take  Janet’s comments about the builders in her District.  I imagine that, if I had talked directly to builders in the First District, they might have been pr etty gloomy, too—again, given some reflection of the coastal situation.  I did talk to Nick Retsinas at the Joint Center for Housing Studies, which Harv ard runs, and he was not particularly negative.  He felt that a correction is occurring but thought th at it would be short-lived.  Now, he did say that they were going to come out with some revisions  and that he was still working on them, so hi s outlook may get more negative. But I am  going to try to keep tabs on where they see things because they  do stay in touch with all the large builders across the country.  Ag ain, the knock-on effect s of lower residential construction may not be all that great.  You mentione d that nonresidential construction is up, but the Greenbook says that it will slow soon.  A good deal of that is oil related; and as long as people are working, incomes are solid, and financial conditi ons remain pretty acco mmodative, consumption ought to remain solid.   So I wonder whether the Greenb ook baseline is really more of a worst-case scenario for residential construction and GDP, though I reali ze regional effects of th e housing slowdown on 47 of 132          employment and spending could be considerable.  If  growth is faster and if your estimates of the NAIRU and the participation rate are more or less on target, I also wonder about the risks of higher inflation over the forecast period  than is the case in the baseli ne as resource pressures grow.  Moderating energy costs ar e helping here, but they have been volatile in bo th directions, and I at least would like to see a somewhat  longer period below recent highs before declaring victory.  In sum, the rather benign ba seline forecast may be the best; but as you noted, th ere are great ranges of uncertainty.  There are downside risks to be sure , and it is impossible to rule out a recession given the slow growth forecast of the Gr eenbook.  But I really think the ri sks to be concerned about lie in the area of stronger growth, more pressure on resources, and higher and mo re persistent inflation. As many other people have comm ented, I, too, found the material on infl ation persistence of some interest and very well done, though I take the point that it is hard to be confident either about the definition of persistenc e or about whether it  is, in fact, lower or higher.  I woul d argue here that it might be better to assume, as we consider the stance of policy, more rather th an less persistence, in part because we are uncertain  and in part because the cost s of being wrong are somewhat asymmetric.  If inflation is less persistent and we  assume it is not and ta ke a conservative policy stance, inflation should retreat quickly and help s hore up our credibility.  Choosing a weaker stance and being wrong about it could be quite costly.  Given the uncertainties facing us, the nature of the incoming data, and th e fact that we have alread y paused, it might not be time right now to take out more inflation insurance, but I certainly think it is time to be  very vigilant.  Thank you.

MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Fifth District’s economy has grown at a somewhat faster pace in recent weeks, reflecti ng a solid uptick in manufacturing.  Preliminary results from our September survey are showing increases in all manufacturing measures, with a 48 of 132       particularly strong performance of shipments and new orders.  The six-months-ahead outlook measures are also coming in broadly stronger.  Grow th in the District servi ces sector continues at a moderate pace.  Retail sales remain somewhat  sluggish, however, held down by soft big-ticket sales, which we understand were mainly in auto and building materials.  The residential real estate market shows signs of further cooling, esp ecially in Maryland and Northern Virginia.  As has been the case for several months, however, re al estate activity varies widely across the District, with the Carolinas, which were less aff ected by the boom, reporti ng continued strength.  Labor market conditions remain taut, with job growth generally re ported to be solid.  Complaints that skilled workers are hard to find continue to be heard, and survey evidence suggests continued wage pressures.  Recent report s regarding District price pressures generally tilt toward the firm side on balance.  Early re ports for September for the manufacturing sector show a notable acceleration in both current pri ces paid and current prices received and large increases in six-months-ahead e xpectations for both.  Reports on service-sector prices are more mixed.  Our respondents from the retail sector re port moderation in current price trends but see more-rapid six-months-ahead price gains than th ey did last month.  Our other service-sector firms report no change in current price trends but expect some moderation in coming months. Regarding the national economy, since our last meeting we have received largely positive news pertaining to the outlook for consumer sp ending.  There was a sizable upward revision to the current level of labor income, which improves th e outlook for real disposable income growth.  Lower energy prices should pr ovide an additional, though one-ti me, boost to consumer spending.  So on net I find myself, again, a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook on consumption. The housing data certainly have been weak er than anticipated, and I now expect a somewhat steeper decline, as does the Gree nbook.  Forecasting this housing adjustment is 49 of 132     particularly difficult because, as President Mi nehan pointed out, we have only one or two episodes for comparison in the post-Reg Q regime, and as David Wilcox pointed out, they don’t seem to closely resemble our current situation.  I find this Greenbook’s more pessimistic outlook for housing itself plausible, but I’m still fairly skeptical of large indirect spillover effects on employment or consumption.  Fo r overall activity , I expect real GDP growth to be somewhat below trend, especially this quarter, but a bove the Greenbook through the end of next year. My views on the inflation situation have not  changed much since our last meeting.  The lower reading on July’s core PCE was encouragin g, and the easing of ener gy prices is clearly providing some relief on headline inflation.  However, July’s lower numbers were not particularly broad based, and the August CPI repo rt shows a significant rebound in core inflation, as President Fisher noted.   While labor compensa tion numbers have been hard to interpret, they also appear to point in the dire ction of greater price pressures, which I take it to be the staff’s view. The downward movement in TIPS inflation compensation since the last meeting has been quite striking—more than 30 basis points at th e five-year horizon.  I’ve made a lot of comments on TIPS inflation compensation spreads in past m eetings, and it’s not clear that this downward movement signals much of an improvement in the outlook for core inflation in the near term.  I pointed out earlier that the Blue book shows that the fall in near-term inflation compensation has occurred mainly at a three-month or four-m onth horizon.  Compensation for the period running from October/November this year to the same period next year has hardly fallen at all, and this to me suggests no significant change in the rate at  which the public expects core inflation to moderate over the next year or  two.  Moreover, one-year-forward  expected inflation rates five and ten years out have not fallen much, so I do not view the recent fall in TIPS inflation compensation as terribly comforting.  Overall, re garding inflation, I’m quite apprehensive about 50 of 132        waiting for core inflation to decline as slowly as it does in the Greenbook or about letting a new reduced-form model do our work for us.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Plosser.

MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Chairman Berna nke.  Overall, economic activity continues to expand in the Third District.  The consen sus in the regional business community is for moderate growth in the months  ahead, but some sentiment has turned more cautious in the intermeeting period.  We have seen a slowdown in regional manuf acturing activity over the past month.  Our business outlook survey, which remains confiden tial until noon tomorrow, weakened somewhat in September with general activ ity falling just barely into th e negative area, at -0.4, from an 18.5 number in August.  This is the first nega tive reading we’ve seen since April 2003.  The diffusion indexes for shipments, new orders, and unfilled orders also turned slightly negative.  I don’t want to read too much into one survey.  The April 2003 dip was ve ry short-lived, and we saw a similar pattern in our survey in the mid- 1990s, when growth slowed but then picked back up again fairly quickly. Part of the slowdown in manufacturing is  at firms that supply the housing industry, reflecting a slowdown in reside ntial real estate, which has become more pronounced in our District since our last meeting. Building permits and home sales were down in July and August.  Inventories of homes on the markets, like much of  the nation, continue to increase.  House-price appreciation has slowed, but we have not yet s een outright declines.  Despite an increase in cancelled sales of new homes, builders generally indicate that their backlogs will keep them relatively busy through the rest of the year. Howe ver, some real estate contractors have begun to lay off employees in anticipation of slower activity. 51 of 132       A pickup in activity in nonresid ential real estate markets ha s been helping to offset the absorption of office space continues to be positive. However, over the next year, some moderation in nonresidential building construction in our  three states is expe cted.  In response to a special question in our  manufacturing survey this month, a bout one-third of the firms report that they plan to lower their ex penditures on new structur es next year compared with this year.  Only one-tenth of our firms expect to raise sp ending on structures.  When we asked a similar question a year ago, about half the firms expected  to raise their expenditures on structures in 2006, and, in fact, we did see that this year. Fo r other categories of capital spending, however, firms by a large margin anticipate expenditures in ’ 07 to be the same as or higher than those in ’06. At some small banks in our District ther e has been a recent pickup in nonperforming loans, which is concentrated in their co mmercial real estate portfolios. Conditions in other sectors of  our region are little changed si nce our last meeting.  Retail sales of general merchandise edged up, but sales of back-to-school merchandise, especially fall apparel, did not seem to meet manufacturers’ expectations.  Payroll employment continues to expand in our three states at a somewhat slower  pace than in the nation as a whole, which is typical of the region. The unemp loyment rate, which had edged down slightly in June, edged back up in July but remains below 5 percent.   While many employers continue to report difficulties in filling positions, the Philadelphia st aff’s forecast is for employment in our region to grow at a pace of about 1 percent over the next year, slightly lower than this year.  Unemployment rates in the region are expected to increase modestly maybe over the next year. Growth continues at a moderate pace, but  we see little indica tion of receding price pressures in the District. The i ndex of prices received in our manufacturing survey edged up in 52 of 132      September.  There was some minor moderation in  prices paid, but that index remains at an extremely high level.  Employers in a number of industries in the region report that wage and salary levels have been moving up at a somewhat faster pace than they did a year ago. Turning to the national economy, my view is not much different than  it was at our last meeting.  My main concern remains the outlook for inflation and the risk it poses for our credibility. In my view, the Fed’s most importa nt contribution to a hea lthy economy is achieving and maintaining price stability.  As expected, incoming data conti nue to indicate a moderation in growth to potential or somewhat below potentia l.  On the negative side, housing has weakened more sharply than many expected, and auto prod uction seems to be turning down for the rest of the year. On the positive side, as has alrea dy been mentioned by a number of others, business investment and corporate profits remain firm.  Em ployment continues to rise at a moderate pace.  The revised wage and salary data are now more  consistent with the strength in consumer spending that we’ve seen, and continued growth in income and perhaps lower gas prices will help offset the possible negative effect that we  may see from a deceleration in housing prices.  On balance, I am somewhat more optimistic th an the Greenbook about the growth side of the economy.  I, too, see growth somewhat below poten tial over the next four quarters, but that’s driven predominantly by a slowdown in the near term—that is, in 2006.  Then I see a return to potential more or less in 2007, although my estimate of potential is probably slightly higher than the Greenbook’s estimate. Now, given the level of precision of our out put measurements and forecast of potential GDP growth, I’m really not overly c oncerned about the forecast at this point.  The adjustment in the housing sector to more-sustainable levels is  forecast to occur wit hout triggering a recession and without triggering much of an increase in un employment.  I believe we should not attempt to 53 of 132      stand in the way of that happeni ng.  It’s a mistake to think that  the forecasted moderation in growth will bring inflation back  to a level consistent with price stability.  Indeed, the Greenbook’s baseline forecast of core PCE infla tion remains above 2 percent through the end of 2008. Even in the alternative Greenbook simulation of a slump in housing, in which aggregate demand weakens and real GDP growth slows to  just 0.6 percent in 2006 and barely above 1 percent in the first half  of 2007, core inflation hardly changes and remains above 2 percent in 2008. Thus, it seems to me that language from us  in the press that indicates that moderating growth will help to restrain inflation is not really consistent with our forecast.  I think it imputes a degree of precision to an estimated Ph illips curve that we just don’t have. Over the intermeeting period, we have had some hopeful news on the inflation front.  Core CPI inflation has not accelerated further in th e past two months, and o il prices seem to be down. Thus, headline inflation, as I pointed out, is likely to be way down in September, and we will seem quite omniscient.  The measure of expected inflation over the ten-year period in our Survey of Professional Forecasters has not chan ged—it remains at 2½ percent.  The August rise in the Michigan survey of one-year-ahead inflation expectations seems to have been reversed in the preliminary September numbers, largely because of the decline in oil prices.  However, both compensation per hour and unit labor costs have b een trending up, not down as the earlier data suggested, although I will note that the usefulness of the compensation numbers in predicting inflation is quite weak. Alt hough core inflation has stabilized, its level is still above our so-called comfort zone. To my mind, the inflation ou tlook is quite uncertain.  We do not yet know if the positive developments in oil prices will stick or not.  I hope they will, but certainly we’ve seen energy prices retreat only to move back up again, and the hurricane season isn’t over yet.  Thus, we 54 of 132       should not become too sanguine about inflation fr om one or two data points.  Moreover, we do not know if the upward revision to labor compen sation will pass through to core inflation, as built into the Greenbook baseline, or if measures  of medium-term inflation expectations will continue to decrease. What we  do know is that core inflation has been above 2 percent for two and a half years and is expected to be there, according to the for ecast, for another two years.  Put another way, there is little evidence in the for ecast that policy actions to date will bring core inflation back below 2 percent before someti me in 2009.  I think that should concern us. I see two inflation scenarios as being plausibl e, and I struggle with which one I believe to be the correct one.  In the first sc enario, core inflation is elevated  primarily because of transitory factors, like the pass-through of hi gher oil prices, and reflects an adjustment to these changes in relative prices.  As oil prices stabilize, assuming that they do, we’d expect to see core inflation presumably fall and fall faster than indicat ed in the baseline Greenbook forecast.  The Greenbook forecast appears to me to incorporate an assumption of relative price stickiness that is inconsistent with some recent studies on microdata.  Thus, in this scenario, I see inflation falling, perhaps more in line with the Greenbook’s alternativ e scenario of less persistent inflation.  This story is appealing and plausible to me, but it rest s on the transitory nature of the current measures of inflation. Even in this most  desirable of scenarios—seeing infl ation fall back to 2 percent or slightly less in 2007—we have to recognize that we will have esse ntially ratified a higher price level driven by oil price incr eases, and we should ask ourselves whether or not we are comfortable with that. In the other scenario, stimulative monetary policy during the past fi ve years has been a major contributor to the rise in core inflati on.  In this case, we w ouldn’t expect to see a 55 of 132       effects of that accommodation.  The Committee has now moved rates up considerably from historical levels. If potential grow th is now lower, as the staff i ndicates, the equilibrium real rate previously thought. Even so, it has only recently  reached that level.  But given the imprecision with which we estimate potential output or equ ilibrium real rates, I really don’t take much comfort from such measurements.  Thus, to my mi nd, there is a significant risk that policy is not yet firm enough to achieve the desired outcome. Regardless of which of thes e two scenarios you think more likely, I think we must be concerned that our credibility and the consequen ces of allowing inflation to remain above our comfort zone for so long are at question. If s cenario 1 comes to pass and inflation falls faster than suggested by the Greenbook baseline, then we would all breathe easier .  But that scenario seems largely a bet on oil prices and on the pres umption that past acco mmodative policy is not playing any role, and that makes me nervous.  I would much prefer to believe that scenario 1 is the operational one. However, again, I find it hard to believe that a four-y ear to five-year period is transitory, so I have to cons ider the alternative.  If the fi rst scenario is wrong and inflation evolves as in scenario 2, then our credibility is se riously at risk if we fail to take further steps to curtail price increases. We might  be lucky.  But we might risk finding ourselves in a situation in which inflation expectations become unhinged, maki ng it more costly to bring inflation back down. As has been mentioned, in the Greenboo k alternative forecast in which inflation expectations become unanchored, inflation remains near 3 percent with only  a slight decline in 2008, and growth slows below 1¾ percent next y ear and remains well below trend through the forecast period. To me, 3 percent inflation and 1½ percent real growth is not a comfortable place to be and would make restraining inflation in the future even harder for us. 56 of 132      I’d like to conclude my remarks by thanking the Board staff for their research on inflation dynamics and the possible reduction in the level of pers istence in recent years.  I think this is an important area for research, but I encourage the staff to continue its work to try to identify structural models of these dynamics in addition to reduced-form models.  I agree with the staff that the monetary policy implications of the reduced-form findings presented in the memo depend on how one chooses to inte rpret them.  The results presented by the staff and others suggest that, since 1990, inflation has become less persistent and appears to be less related to other macro variables as well.  We do not know whether these changes are due to a more aggressive stance of monetary policy against infl ation and to our credibil ity or to fundamental changes in the domestic or world economy.  If we  suppose that lower infla tion persistence is due to enhanced policy credibility, then it is incumbent upon this Committee to maintain that credibility. That is, we should not  expect inflation pers istence to remain low if the Fed acts in a manner that is inconsistent with its commitment  to price stability or risks its credibility by neglecting to take actions that return the economy to price stab ility in a reasonable period of time.  We shouldn’t ignore the fact that the longer we allow devi ations from price stability to persist, the higher is the risk to our credibility and the higher is the risk that recent high inflation readings will raise longer-term expectations, thereby putting us in a very awkward position a year from now.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, I’d characteri ze the Tenth District’s  economy as quite healthy right now. As you know, the Tenth Dist rict has benefited perh aps disproportionately from the rise in energy prices over the past few y ears, and this is providi ng considerable stimulus to the local and state economies in the District.  We are also seeing strong manufacturing activity 57 of 132      driven by exports of District products.  Although the housing market s across the District can be characterized as soft, we have no reports of seri ous declines in prices anywhere in the region.  Retail sales, excluding autos, also are holding up pretty well for us.  The other soft spot for us is agriculture, and that is tied pr etty much to the drought that  we continue to experience. Regarding the national economy, the economic information received since the last meeting confirms a further slowing of economic activity this quarter.  Moreover, weakness in housing and auto production suggests th at the fourth quarter could be a little bit weaker as well.  At the same time, we have recently experienced the sizable and largely unexpected declines in energy prices that we have talked about here, wh ich, if maintained, could provide some stimulus over the balance of the year to offset some of  that weaker informati on.  Currently, I expect growth to slow to a range of 2 percent to 2½ percent in the second half  of the year and to rebound to above 2½ percent or to 3 percent next year.  Generall y speaking, I am more optimistic than the Greenbook, especially w ith regard to housing and co nsumer spending, and I’m not nearly as pessimistic as th e Greenbook on potential output. As to housing, we are in fact, as all ha ve noted, squeezing out of that sector the speculative excesses that developed with the low interest rates of recent years—and doing so is unavoidable if we want to correct the sector. The adjustment process has obviously been painful for some, and it has not yet run its course.  Howe ver, we perhaps see our selves getting a little closer to the bottom than we might  think right now, and that’s re lated to the fact that credit remains available at reasonabl e rates for most homebuyers, as suggested by the recent information on mortgage applications.  So, yes, it is painful, and yes, we are going through it; but I don’t think it is necessar ily long lasting in terms of the consumer’s position. 58 of 132        For the consumer more generally, the situ ation is obviously mixed.  On the one hand, consumption will likely receive less stimulus goi ng forward from the withdrawal of home equity, and with slower house-price apprec iation, wealth effects will likel y be lower as well.  On the other hand, higher labor compensation and lowe r energy bills should provide support to the consumer in terms of confidence and the ability to spend.  Overal l, I continue to believe that there are somewhat more downside risks than upside risks to the outlook over the next quarters, but I think we are moving in a fairly cons istent way as far as GDP growth goes. Finally, let me provide my perspective on the inflation outlook.  My overall views on inflation have not changed materi ally since the last meeting.  I continue to expect core PCE inflation to moderate from about 2.3 percent this year to 2.1 per cent next year on the course we have right now. The big negative on inflation, of  course, is the higher tr ajectory for labor costs, which has been mentioned.  Although the re cent revisions to compensation are perhaps somewhat unsettling, such concerns are partly  offset by the recent more-favorable monthly inflation numbers and by the significant fall in the prices of oil, gasoline, and natural gas in recent weeks.  Although the recen t inflation data have not caus ed me to alter my inflation outlook, I am in one sense more confident in th e forecast of moderation than I was a month ago or so. On balance, as we look at  all this, I agree that we still have some upside risks to inflation that we have to remain aware of as we look to the policy discussion ahead.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, I made a special effort to talk with my directors and busi ness contacts about two topics—developments in housing markets and inflation.  My District has be en growing at a slower pace than most other parts of the country; consequentl y, housing prices in the District  never appreciated as much as 59 of 132      those in the hot markets in the c ountry.  Nonetheless, a major Rea ltor in our region told me that houses in his market, which includes the norther n half of Ohio and the western half of Pennsylvania, are taking longer to  sell and that the aver age price of houses sold from January to nationally the housing market still has a way to go  before conditions stabilize.  Nevertheless, right now he sees only a limited possibility that th e adjustment process will cause serious harm to the U.S. economy. Apparently people are not leaving much to chance.  I heard a report yesterday morning that sales at religious st ores for statues of St. Joseph have be en soaring.  [Laughter] It seems as though people who are trying to sell their homes are buying statues of St. Joseph because he’s the patron saint of real estate, and they’re burying him next to the “For Sale” sign.  Unfortunately, there is no patron sa int for central bankers.  [Laughter] Some forecasters, like the Greenbook, ar e expecting strength in the commercial construction sector to offset much of the weakness  in residential building.  One of my directors, who represents a large national commercial cons truction firm, has indicated that commercial building in the past few years has been boosted by the growth of health an d education sectors.  His entire book of business increased 10 percent in real terms this year co mpared with last, and he is looking to next year to have the book of business increase 3 to 4 percent.  However, he is expecting it to be flat in 2008, a nd his story squares with what I am hearing from bankers as well—namely, that the flow of commercial loans in the pipeline, although not rapidly falling off, is slowing, and it hasn’t been bu ilding as it was.  The Greenbook baseline captures very well the pattern that I’ve been describing in its projec tion for nonresidential investment over the next few years. 60 of 132        Now, turning to inflation, the two CPI reports that we received during this intermeeting period have not provided me with enough evidence th at inflationary pressures have meaningfully diminished.  The reports, however, have encouraged me to think that the forward momentum has been broken, but I’d like to see the next few CPI numbers be at least as good as those for July and August, if not better, to be convinced that that momentum has been broken.  I’ve heard some hopeful comments regarding inflation in the past fe w weeks from several of my  directors.  Just a few months ago they were indi cating that elevated energy pri ces and material prices had provided them with an opportunity to get more -generalized price increases, and they had wondered whether that was going to  be a one-time catch-up opportuni ty or whether it would be persistent. Now it appears to have been a one-t ime opportunity, which is passing or has passed.   Several of my directors repor ted last week that they have  resorted to unbundling their prices to cope with the rising pr ices of energy and material costs.  On their invoices, they are breaking out the price increases th at are due to the increased cost  of steel, copper, energy, and shipping in order to pass them on.  Apparent ly, their customers are willing to accept price increases that are due to those increased energy and material costs.  But the expectation on the part of both buyers and sellers is that, as energy and material costs dissipa te, the ability to pass on price increases will be remove d.  Several of my directors said  that they are not planning any price increases for the next year and that they suspect their commodity costs will be lower than they were this year as well. As others have mentioned, there has been some  interest in the elevated unit labor costs in the second-quarter produ ctivity and cost reports.  As Da ve noted, the compensation growth underlying unit labor costs was boosted when the BLS took on board the first-quarter unemployment insurance tax records.  There is some suspicion that the dramatic increase in 61 of 132       compensation had a lot to do with stock options  and incentive pay, but th e underlying data are not available yet, so we don’t know for sure. My staff was able to get some summary figures for Ohio. Compensation has been growing steadily in  Ohio over the past se veral years, but the preliminary figures are flat for the first quarter  of 2006.  However, ther e was double-digit growth in three sectors—management of companies, finan ce and insurance, and util ities.  These sectors are often the ones that show substantial growth in the first quarters beca use they pay out stock options and that’s often when those stock options are realized.  So at  least in my District there is no evidence of any broad-based acceleration in co mpensation, and I tend to agree with the staff’s view that it’s too early to incorporate those hi gher unit labor costs into  the inflation outlook. At our last meeting, I expr essed the opinion that whatever  weakness we would see in GDP was more likely to reflect demand factors than supply factors,  and therefore I saw risks to both our objectives. The current Greenbook baselin e projection for GDP is even lower than it was at the time of our last meeting because of revisions, as Dave mentioned, to both supply and demand factors.  I still think that, if the Greenbo ok projection comes true, softer demand is likely to be the more dominant explanation.  Neverthele ss, I would like to see further evidence that inflationary pressures have been checked, if not actually reversed, before I would conclude that the risks to our objectives are evenly  balanced.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. GUYNN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since this is my last meeting, I want to say formally what an honor it has been to serve unde r your leadership, at leas t for a short while, and 62 of 132         under Chairman Greenspan’s leadership before th at.  And to my colleagues around the table and around the room, I want to say what an extraord inary experience it has been to work with you not only on policymaking but also on the other Syst em business for so many years.  There is a lot that I will miss, and your friendship is at the top of the list. I will be mercifully short with my comme nts this morning.  At our last meeting, I indicated that the data from around our District had finally begun to  reflect the anecdotal reports of slowing that we’ve been getting for some mont hs.  The most recent da ta underscore that trend, but with some crosscurrents that suggest that some sectors continue to be reasonably solid. With a total of forty-four directors in the si x offices in our Atlanta District, we have an unusually large complement of regular mont h-to-month contacts who can often signal a significant shift in sentiment about what may lie  ahead.  Sometime ago we began to ask our directors each month to give us not only their views on specific economic issues but also their overall sense of the economic outlook.  Very simp ly, we asked them to indicate whether they think six months out that growth will be stronger,  about the same, or weak er.  Over the past six months we have watched the aggregation of thos e views deteriorate to the point that, in our tabulation last week, the only dir ectors who expected things six m onths out to be better were from New Orleans, where economic conditions can only get better.   Some of the uneasiness about the outlook in our region clear ly reflects the sharp housing adjustment that we’ve seen, particularly in our once-hot coastal markets.  That painful adjustment continues, with folks in the industr y saying that they think the bottom may be as much as a year away. I talked just yesterda y afternoon, before I left to come to Washington, with the CEO of one of the large national hom ebuilders headquartered  in Atlanta.  Mr. Chairman, I think he was in the group that came to see you and others just a few weeks ago.  He 63 of 132        emphasized that the adjustment that’s going on is  broader and more significant than the data suggest. He said that sales cance llation rates, even in cities like Atlanta, now exceed 50 percent, whereas they had been running abou t 30 percent.  He underscored something that we have talked about before, and it has been menti oned again this morning, that the fall in the real selling price is often masked by incentives and give-backs that have become very widespread.  He said the only exception to the adjustment in housing that he  could see was in the major Texas markets.   The stories out of New Orleans continue to be depressing, with business leaders now saying it may be a decade, rather than a few years, before the housing crisis there can be substantially resolved. There are simply not enough habitable housing units to accommodate the workers, especially low-skilled hospitality indu stry workers who are needed by businesses that are trying desperately to reopen and to get back on their feet.  As a consequence, more and more jobs are being moved out to other cities, and many of them are not expected to return.  As I mentioned at the outset, there are also  more-encouraging crossc urrents in our region.  Manufacturing activity stil l looks reasonably solid; transporta tion and tourism do as well.  We had some good employment gains in  all our states last month, af ter some disappointing data the month before. We continue to get reports of s hortages of skilled labor in a number of trades, including the construction industry.  Despite continuing input price pressures, which others have talked about, we’re told that the ability to pass along those costs in final goods and services is still very limited for many businesses. As far as the national economy is concerned, it’s my view that we’re about where we expected to be at this point, with no huge surprises since our last  meeting.  Evidence of slowing is now more apparent, but many crosscurrents also exist at the national level.  Corporate profits are high, investment spending still seems to be reasonably strong, and consumer spending 64 of 132          remains supportive of growth.  While many sectors continue to perform reasonably well, as my regional remarks suggest, considerable uncertain ty does exist about housing, both in terms of how steep the slowdown will be and what the slowdown might mean for consumer spending. Although energy prices have cl early fallen back, inflation, as everyone has said, remains above our preferred range. We’v e had some encouraging monthly inflation data since our last meeting, but the hoped-for moderation in prices that we  expected to see is still mostly a forecast.  Still, I take some encouragement from the fact th at the forecast for lower inflation readings over the period ahead is not only reflected in the Greenbook but also in the modeling work my own staff has done and in the projec tions of outside forecasters.  Additionally, modest inflation expectations seem to be holding.  And markets ar e not expecting us to deviate from our current policy stance, at least for the short run. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I want to say to you and others that I’m counting on all of you to protect the buying power of my hard-earned retirement savi ngs.  [Laughter] I’m going to have lots more time as a retiree to be a Fed watcher and a letter writer, and I prom ise to be in touch if you don’t do a good job. [Laughter] Thank you very much.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you ve ry much, Jack.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me  make just two or three fairly general comments. First of all, I, too, want to compli ment the staff for the paper on inflation dynamics.  I think it was very well done. It is  important, and we need to take  it seriously, and I view it in some sense as a follow-up to some of the work that has been going on at some of the Reserve Banks in recent years. One of the things that I think is important about it is that, at a minimum, it ought to raise a yellow flag about our ability empi rically to go from measur es like output gaps, or the NAIRU, or other measures of capacity to th e determination of inflation.  I don’t want to 65 of 132           exaggerate that point. I know th ere are different ways of interpreting it, and I know the work isn’t definitive. But I do, nevertheless, think that we need to think about it seriously and consider it when we discuss the inflation outlook a nd its relation to economic performance. Second, with regard to the economic outlook, I indicated at the last meeting that I was somewhat more optimistic than the Greenbook, and that gap has opened up even further.  I am more optimistic, although I’m not talking about th e current quarter.  One way of summarizing my position is that I think the positive effects of higher incomes, lower energy prices, higher equity values, and stable-to-declin ing interest rates are greater than you apparently do.  I say that even though I can readily imagine that the decline in housing activity  turns out to be both more protracted and deeper than  you forecast it to be. By the way, as a footnote, if I did the numb ers right, back in 1965 and 1966, we did get a was considered a mini-recession, or a pause, or something—I’ve forgotten what the exact term was. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Growth recession. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Yes, something like growth re cession.  But the bottom line here is that it hasn’t been a good idea to underestimate or unde rrate the performance of the U.S. economy since late 1982. Finally, with regard to infl ation, even if I’m right about the economic outlook and we get more growth, I don’t think that necessarily implies that we’ll have more inflation than is predicted in the Greenbook.  Having sa id that, I still think th at core inflation at its current rate is of concern, as is the outlook that you portray.  Thanks. 66 of 132

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, it’s 11:00.  Why don’t we take fifteen minutes for coffee. Thank you. [Coffee break] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I think we can reconvene.  Vice Chairman Geithner. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER. Thank you. Let me just start with the broad contours of our outlook. Growth has obviously slowed. The second half is likely to be relatively weak, but the only place we see pronounced weakness is  in housing, and we expect a return to moderate growth going forward. Core inflation s eems to be easing a bit, and it may have peaked in the second quarter, if you look just at the three-month annualized numbers.  But inflation remains uncomfortably high, and our forecast as sumes only a very gradual moderation over the next two years. In terms of numbers, we expect  the real economy to gr ow at around its 3 percent potential rate in ’07 and ’08. We  expect core PCE inflation on a Q4/Q4 basis to come in just below 2½ percent in ’06 and to moderate to abou t 2 percent in ’07 and 1. 8 percent in ’08.  Our outlook is largely unchanged from August.  It’s c onditioned on a path for policy that is flat at current levels for two to three quarters. This put s us slightly above the level that is currently priced into the risk-adjuste d Eurodollar futures curve. In terms of uncertainty and risk, we see somewhat greater downside risks to demand growth than we saw in August, but the inflation risks still seem likely to be to the upside.  Weighing the balance among these co mpeting risks, we believe, as we did in August, that inflation risks should remain the predominant co ncern of the Committee, not so much, to borrow the Chairman’s formulation, because the proba bility of a higher inflation outcome is substantially greater than that of a much weak er growth outcome but because the costs of an erosion in inflation performa nce would be more damaging. 67 of 132         On the growth outlook, we’re seeing a some what greater adjustment in residential investment than we anticipated, but this ha s not yet induced or been accompanied by a significant weakness outsid e housing.  Of course, the outlook for the economy as a whole should not be particularly sensitive to  plausible estimates of the direct effects of the remaining adjustment, whatever it is, left in residential i nvestment.  What seems more important, of course, is the potential effect of wh at’s happening in housing on cons umer and business spending.  We just don’t see troubling signs yet of collateral damage, and we are not expecting much.  The fundamentals supporting relatively strong produc tivity growth seem to be intact.  The acceleration of the nominal compen sation growth that appears to  be under way, combined with the moderation of headline inflation that we e xpect as energy prices moderate, should produce fairly strong growth of household income, even  with the moderation in employment growth to trend. Corporate balance sheet profitability rema ins strong.  Domestic demand growth outside the United States is expected to remain quite r obust even though there ha s been some moderation in current measures of activity in some markets.  Of course, the level of interest rates is not particularly high in nominal or r eal terms.  Equity prices and cr edit spreads suggest a reasonable degree of confidence in the prospects for future e xpansion.  Financial market participants report very strong continued demand for credit and for ri sk generally and very ample liquidity.  This strength may reflect other factors that are operating on demand for financial assets, but still survey-based measures of confidence have not de teriorated dramatically.  This, of course, may prove too optimistic on the growth outlook, and the risks seem weighted to the downside. On the inflation front, recent data have not al tered our forecast or, really, our assessment of the risks to that forecast.  Although there are signs of mode ration in underlying inflation, the 68 of 132       core PCE and a range of alternative measures continue to grow at  levels that are uncomfortably high. We expect further moderati on to occur only gradually over th e forecast period.  The latest data have been somewhat reassuring, and infl ation expectations at various horizons have behaved relatively well since our last meeting.  The acceleration in compensation growth and unit labor costs does not justify a higher inflation forecast in our view, provided that expectations remain well anchored, business markups fall, th e ongoing moderation in growth reduces pressure on resource utilization, the futures curve proves a reasonably accurate prediction for the path of energy prices, the dollar declin es only modestly, and so fort h.  These are reasonably good arguments, but we still think the risks are to the upside.  Over the past two years, we have consistently revised up our forecasts for inflati on.  I’m not sure we really yet understand the forces behind the unanticipated acceleration in  underlying inflation.  Medium-term inflation expectations, while not rising at st ated levels, may be higher than is  consistent with an inflation objective in the range the Committee has talked about in the past. Containing these upside risks should be the dominant focus of policy until we see a more-pronounced moderation in current and expected underlying inflation. As my comme nts imply, we don’t have a lot of differences with the Greenbook on the contours of the ou tlook.  The Greenbook shows slower growth relative to lower potential but also more inflation than we do.  It also shows more slack with more inflation and a little less confidence in th e strength of demand growth than we do for the reasons I hope I explained. I see certain questions as key.  On the growth front the question is, Will weakness cumulate?  If we see a more-pronounced actual dec line in housing prices, will that have greater damage on confidence and spending?  But the mo re interesting questions  are really on the inflation forecast, and let me just talk very briefly about two. 69 of 132       First, does the Greenbook forecast produce enough moderation in inflation soon enough to keep inflation expectati ons anchored?  The baseline fo recast has inflation falling to 1.5 percent, at least based on th e last time we saw a long-term forecast, only over a very protracted period—a period that is significantly longer than the one many central bankers would consider an acceptable deviation from an infla tion target.  We have already seen a bit of troubling speculation from people who write about us.  This Committee may have more inflation tolerance or a higher implicit target than its predec essor.  Should we try to achieve a more rapid moderation of inflation? How s hould we evaluate the costs and be nefits of trying to achieve a quicker and more substantial mode ration of inflation, particularly  given the tenuous state of the evidence on inertia and persistence?  Is this gentle and gradual expected moderation in inflation optimal, given the softness of the outlook for dema nd?  These are questions that are worthy of a more explicit discussion by the Committee, par ticularly if we’re going to talk about moving toward a quantitative definition of price stabi lity with more disclosure around the forecast. The second and related question is about inflat ion in our forecast:  With the stance of monetary policy that is now priced into the ma rkets—this is a softer path than the one in and gradually moderating core infl ation?  I think we can be le ss confident than the confidence you might read into current mark et expectations and the uncerta inty that surrounds them.  Of course, the behavior of long-term inflation expect ations in financial markets suggests that this risk is not particularly high at present and that we can take some more time to get a better handle on the evolution of the economy before deciding what is next in term s of monetary policy actions. But I think that we may have more to do, and we should try to avoid fostering too much 70 of 132       confidence in the markets that we’re done.  We need to preserve the flexibility to do more if that proves necessary to keep inflation expectations anchored.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman … Governor Kohn.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Whatever you want to call me is fine.  [Laughter] I’m just glad to be here.  [L aughter]  I don’t think I can follow that up. Given the initial cond itions—the doubling and more of en ergy prices over the past two years, the overexuberant housing ma rket coming to grips with a renor malization of interest rates, a very low personal saving rate, and an uncomfortab le increase in inflation this spring—a period of modestly below-trend growth and gradually ebbing inflation, as in the Greenbook forecast, is about as good an outcome as we can expect, as Dave Stockton noted.  In  that regard, several developments over the intermeeting period have made me a bit more comfortable with the plausibility of such an outlook. The weakness in housing has deepened and is  more definitively leading to growth of output below potential.  In fact, in my view the behavior of the housing market constitutes the main downside risk to sustained moderate econo mic growth.  We’re in the middle of a housing adjustment, which has been hard to forecast, es pecially because it involves the unwinding of an unknown amount of speculative dema nd.  With inventories rising and reports of price cuts getting greater prominence, the market isn’t yet showing signs of clearing and stabilizing.  In the Greenbook forecast, residential investment, though weak, is supported by continued growth of income and relatively low mortgage rates, whil e house prices basically level out in nominal terms.  As the Greenbook notes, however, this forecast leaves some aspects of the existing disequilibrium intact, most notably the high level of prices relative to rents.  Also, the cutback in construction doesn’t completely offset the apparent excess building of the boom period.  As a 71 of 132       consequence, I see the housing forecast in the Greenbook as very far from the worst-case scenario that President Minehan characterized it as .  And, we are just beginning to see the effect of the downshift in house-price inflati on on consumption starting to play out. Outside of housing, however, recent developments should help to sustain continued economic expansion.  Financial conditions re main quite supportive of both business and household spending. Long-term interest rates ha ve fallen appreciably since midyear, and they are low in both real and nominal terms.  Risk spreads are narrow, banks have not pulled back on business credit, and equity prices have risen on balance in recent months.  Lenders and investors appear to remain confident that the economy will continue to expand at a decent pace.   Higher levels of labor income in the first half  of the year, along with a favorable effect on disposable income of a decline in energy prices, will help support consumer spending going forward. Economies elsewhere seem to be e xpanding at a solid clip.  Moreover, they are probably less vulnerable to spillovers from a housing-led slowdown of growth in the United States than they were to weakness in 2001. Th at weakness was centered in a global market for investment goods and was reflected in global declines in equity prices. The less robust economy should present businesses with a more competitive environment in which it will be harder to pass through cost increases.  In addition, the decline in energy prices, along with the leveling out of other commodity prices, will reduce cost pressures on businesses and should feed through in some measure to lower core inflation, especially as slower growth damps pricing power. The drop in ener gy prices has already restrained inflation expectations a bit.  For all these reasons, I’m al so a little more comfortable with the forecast of gradually ebbing co re inflation.   72 of 132        Nonetheless, I still see significant upside risk to such a path for inflation.  In part, this reflects my uncertainty as to the reasons for the ri se in inflation this spring and summer.  Feed-through of energy and other commodity prices must have contributed to so me extent, and we can see evidence of this in the greater price increases  for some of the more energy-intensive sectors, such as for airfares. A portion of the pickup is in the rent-of-shelter ca tegory, likely from a shift to rental housing as expectations of house-price appreciation have been sc aled back.  But price increases have picked up in a number of ot her categories, and alt hough energy costs probably accounted for some of this acceleration, we can’t di smiss the possibility that other forces were at work—for example, more general pressure of demand on potential output. A reduction of those types of pressures is still only a forecast. On the cost side, as many have commented, the compensation and unit labor cost da ta, while flawed in many respects, could be pointing to a risk that higher labor costs will persist, putting pressu re on prices that might only be partially and reluctantly absorbed by profit margins. In sum, Mr. Chairman, I’m a bit more comfortable with something like the path for the economy and inflation in the Greenbook forecast, but uncertainties are quite high.  They might even justify the “higher than usual” descripti on.  The downward path for inflation remains at risk, and as others have  noted, the costs of exceeding that pa th could be disproportionate.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Bies. MS. BIES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want  to start my remarks today by reflecting on some results of the latest Duke University CFO su rvey.  This survey is only about six or seven years old, but the one that was just concluded on September 10 has CFOs’ optimism at the lowest levels in five years, and so it’s continui ng to show an erosion of  their confidence.  I found 73 of 132     the CFOs’ number 1 worry—weak consumer demand—interesting because it wasn’t there before, and that uncertainty is part of what th e CFOs are worrying about.  Their second biggest concern is rising labor costs, which they attribute primarily to the scarcity of labor.  They are anticipating that the scarcity is going to continue to drive labor costs higher.   In terms of their hiring plans, they are planning now to hire fewer people than they hired last quarter.  They are expecting to increase employment over the next twelve months 0.8 percent; last quarter’s survey showed 1.3 percent, so that’s qu ite a slowdown.  However, they’re  going to increase outsourced employment 4.3 percent.  Thus what is show ing up is the uncertainty—wanting to use an adjustable labor force to get th e flexibility because of the uncertainty.  They are also trimming their capital spending plans over the next twelve months to 5. 1 percent, compared with 7.5 percent last quarter. Thus the su rvey indicates that CFOs have growing concern; they are still optimistic overall, but I thi nk that caution is there. Now, in looking at the numbers myself, I’m perhaps not quite as pessimistic.  Again, as several of you have said—and Dave commented in his remarks—except for housing, the economy really does look good.  As you know, I’ve b een worried about the mortgage market and housing for quite a while. In an endeavor to fi nd something good to say, I have noticed that, in the past couple of months, the Mortgage Bankers Association index of new loan applications for purchase mortgages looks as though it ’s starting to level off.  Very  often that could be a leading indicator, so that could be a positive sign. Howe ver, as some of you have remarked, there’s a lot of speculation in the housing markets that ha s to unwind. All the folks who bought housing for investment have to do something as they see housing prices slowing and the financing costs to carry their investments going up.  How that unwindi ng will occur, given the substantial size of 74 of 132       the speculative positions in some markets, is so mething that will need very close monitoring.  I know that our supervisory staff is focusing on that, too. People are focusing on the fact that delinquency rates in mortgages still look good.  However, we’ve seen a very rapid increase in debt service ratios sin ce 2004.  I’m concerned, again, with the amount of adjustable-rate mortga ges out there that will reprice in the months ahead. If, as we think, some of these loans, pa rticularly subprime loans, were made mainly on the collateral value of the house and not on the af fordability of the mortgage, we could see more distress in the borrowers’ markets coming forward.  If that’s the case, it could have spillover effects on consumer spending more broadly. On the positive side, payroll growth has been good in the past three months—128,000.  It has picked up a bit, and it is significantly a bove the Greenbook forecast, and that gives me some optimism.  It’s putting more income in people’ s pockets to spend, and the unemployment rate has been stable. Hourly earnings, however, are rising faster.  While that  acceleration can support consumer spending, it contribute s to my concern about where we’re going in the long run on inflation. As I look at the Greenbook forecasts since May, we’ve been continuing to project more and more inflation going forward.  The private s ector has basically been doing that in their forecasts as well. When I look at those forecasts , I’m concerned that for various reasons we have reduced our estimates of the tre nd rate of growth.  As we bri ng down the trend rate of growth— and I realize that, as several have said, we’re at the lower end of the private-sector growth forecasts—I worry about the disconnect.  Are we seeing a slowdown in pot ential that others aren’t? Or if we’re right that potential growth is lower and the private forecasters are right that real growth is going to be faster, then we could have more infl ation pressures going forward.  For 75 of 132        the first time, we are also looking at prices in 200 8, and they continue to rise at over 2 percent.  They’ve been over 2 percent for two years. I wo rry, from the standpoint of our credibility, about what having such a long period above 2 percent m eans.  So I believe we will see moderation of inflation, but I think it’s importa nt to preserve our flexibility and be able to respond if these worst-case scenarios that I laid out be come more troubling to us going forward.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh.  

[SECTION]

MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to make four points, a couple of which have been stated by my colleagues this morning, and then spend a little time on each of them.  First, like many of you, I am more concer ned about the upside risks to inflation than downside risks to output and employment.  Seco nd, the markets responded qu ite positively to the last FOMC, so they’ve been going in the right di rection.  The stock market has been up, the bond months into being a central banker , I’m worried.  [Laughter] So I join the ranks of Jack and the rest of you who have been here a bit longer than I have.  Third, for the first time since I’ve been here, I’m a little less sanguine about the supply side of the economy in looking at the business base, the cap-ex base, and the manufacturing base.  But I find  myself today probably more comfortable, or at least as comfortable as I’ve be en, with the strength and resilience of consumer demand.  The fourth point I would like to spend a couple of minutes on is th at I think we are at the beginning of a major te st of market liquidity that’s happeni ng in real time in the fixed-income First, on the consumer side, consumer spendi ng appears to be strong and resilient.  As was noted at the outset, there was a strong July PCE reading, on par with the strongest gains of 76 of 132       the year, suggesting to me that consumer demand may actually be accelerating from the second quarter into the third quarter.  The Greenbook estimate of 3 percen t PCE for the third quarter and 2.75 percent PCE for the fourth quarter may actually be understating the strength of the consumer, particularly with falling gas prices. I’m also comforted by income growth and labor market conditions, which I see as likely to be far more important to consumer spendi ng than housing wealth.  Consumer income gains appear to be rising. I’ve made note previously of very strong  tax receipts.  Although they’ve tapered off somewhat, they continue to be r obust.  Tax receipts for the year are up about 12.4 percent. The past couple of months would suggest they are in th e high single digits, and though there is some noise in those data, I do take some comfort from them.  Other recent corroboration of labor inco me, with the revised NIPA data and other measures, suggests that real wage and salary income again ma y be accelerating.  It has been noted this morning that stock options and bonus payments may have had an effect in the first quarter, creat ing a bit of noise in those data. However, they should also remind us of  the wealth effect of equity gains, which may partially offset the negative wealth effect fr om housing, particularly  with 100 million members of the investor class. I think that’s something that needs to be consider ed in our thinking about the strength of the consumer during the forecast pe riod.  Finally, as I think Governor Bies noted, the labor markets remain reasonably tight.  De spite the softness in housing, unemployment insurance claims and unemployment rates remain quite  encouraging. Turning for a moment to business, about which I am perhaps a little less optimistic than I’ve been before, industrial production is still reasonably strong but, perhaps disappointingly, has flattened for August, even though the July numbers appeared to be on an upward trend.  When I looked back over the past 24 monthly readings for 2004 and 2005, both of IP and retail sales, I 77 of 132      found that each declined about six times, so I’m not sure that we’re seeing a new trend here.  My own sense of where IP is in September is that  it’s remarkably strong, but, again, I have some caution that I didn’t have before. One other note—unlike the Greenbook, I sense that exports are likely to make a real, meaningful contri bution to GDP during the forecast period.   In terms of capital expenditure growth rates,  another survey I’d like to mention is the Business Roundtable survey that came out a couple of days ago.  It was more negative on capital expenditures than it has ever been. I would sa y that the group has a mi xed record in calling inflection points, but the survey re sults, nonetheless, suggest that only a little less than 40 percent expect increased cap-ex in the ne xt six months, whereas about half  said that cap-ex would remain constant over that period. Perhap s that’s an effort to protect margins with higher costs that could be only partially passed through. As I’ve noted be fore, earnings growth continues to meet or beat expectations, certainly th rough the second and third quarters , and my own sense is that fourth-quarter earnings will also  be fine, probably still at the double-digit rates of about 10 or 11 percent.  Perhaps that explains some of th e taking the foot off the accelerator in terms of capital expenditures. In terms of housing, to add a bit to the pr evious discussion, my ow n sense is that the residential sector may have, in fact, crowded out some nonresidential loans during the most recent boom and that nonresidential construction wa s marked up sharply in the second quarter, to an annual growth rate of 22 percent.  My sense is also that the market’s ca pital allocation function is working well. C&I loans are growing about 15 percen t or more, perhaps the highest rate in the past 20 or 25 years, and we’ll probabl y see a little more capital allocation to this nonresidential sector. Whereas the Greenbook assu mes a significant deceleration in this group, I 78 of 132     think that there’s reason for some upside surprise.  As a result, I expect stronger GDP for the second half of ’06 than the Greenbook does. Turning to inflation, I think that inflation risks have not materially receded, though we’ve probably seen acceleration stopping.  That is, we’v e seen the top, but the new direction is not clear. One measure that I’ll look to over the next six weeks is what’s going on in the capital markets.  Since we last met, ten-year yields have probably moved down about 15 basis points, and the Greenbook reports that there should be a slowdown in business debt financing.  That statement of the Greenbook is probably reflected in  the data that we’ve seen in July and August in terms of the capital markets.  But the test of liquidity to which I referred will be a big supply/demand test over the course of the next  six or seven weeks.  Perhaps $150 billion in funding is coming to market from the bank loan market, the leveraged loan market, high yield and investment grade.  Admitte dly, in that $150 billion number, which stacks up as a big number even compared with only a couple of years ago, when we would see financings over a year of $175 billion, there are some elephant deals, and they are probably distorting that number a bit.  HCA is coming to market with a $20 billion deal , as well as a couple of other major leveraged buyouts. The liquidity in those capital markets appear s to be incredibly robust at this moment; there are massive pipelines.  You hear word s like “euphoria.”  I woul d say that the capital six-week opportunity, than they ha ve perhaps ever been.  A signifi cant variety of pa rticipants are playing. This is a function of huge soverei gn debt inflows and of  significant liability management by issuers—some of the CFOs to wh om Governor Bies was speaking.  Investors at this moment appear to have very little leverage in  terms of the pricing of these deals or in terms 79 of 132     of some of the covenant protecti ons that were referenced at an earlier meeting.  Previously, I had said that, particularly in the i nvestment-grade market, we were s eeing issuers hesitate to come to to be taken out by a leveraged- buyout player, they wouldn’t want  to have a change-of-control premium.  Now that these markets are as robust as they are, those same brand-name issuers are coming back to the market, and at this point it seems as though they will likely get their pricing done. So, I do not yet have a final determination of  what this pipeline looks like; but if all goes through, it will suggest to me that there has been  rather massive liquidity during this period.  Other measures of liquidity appear to be somewh at more encouraging from my perspective.  The commodities markets have been mentioned.  They ’ve probably had some hot money come out of them, with a lot of retail investors, both dir ectly and through pension funds, coming in too late and maybe exiting for good, as well as some very  encouraging news about the TIPS markets, which were referenced previously. In sum, I would say that the markets seem  to be very impressed by our letting the economy develop, particularly in the next couple of quarters, a nd I’m impressed by the market’s confidence in us. I think that it puts a significa nt responsibility on us and is probably the only way I can reconcile the rather robus t gains in the equity markets a nd in the debt markets over this period. That is, the markets believe that somehow  we’re going to manage to thread the needle and nail the perfect landing. Ther e is, I think, increasingly a one- way bet in the bond markets in that they believe that there is a degree of  accommodation and they have built in a degree of loosening in the forecast period, which we don’t have a proper understanding of.  Only a couple of months ago we were describing, and the Chai rman described, an economy in transition and 80 of 132          the very wide tails around that. We still have th e wide tails, but the markets seem to think that we’re going to nail this landing. I think the minutes from the last meeting faithfully captured our concerns about the appreciable upside risks remaining.  Either the ma rkets didn’t buy that desc ription, or they were convinced that we were going to ac t with an incredibly deft touch to stop that inflation.  All in all, I would say that in the markets there is le ss dispersion of views than  is probably healthy and less dispersion of views over these different scen arios than we found ourselves discussing some time ago.  So with that, I think we’ll have a more robust discussion in  the next round.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

MR. KROSZNER. Thank you very much.  Unfo rtunately, I think we find ourselves in an uncomfortable position like that  of six weeks ago, with a continuing mix of inflationary pressures and decelerating economic growth at th e same time.  I think the fundamentals are in place for a continued moderation of growth but  not a contraction, much as the Greenbook describes. Obviously, housing is  a risk that everyone has talk ed about.  But the key, as many people have also mentioned, is maintaining contained inflation expectations, and that comes down to thinking about whether so me of the factors that we’ve been seeing have been more transitory or more persistent. Let me first talk about growth and go thr ough the C plus I plus G plus net exports.  I would agree with the staff’s characterization that world economic gr owth is not quite as strong as some others have put forward.  I don’t think we ’re going to be seeing an enormous export boom.  Also, as briefly mentioned, I see very little on the govern ment stimulus side.  Tax revenues, as Governor Warsh mentioned, were very high.  Sp ending is being kept re latively tight.  On 81 of 132    investment, we’re seeing some strength in capita l spending.  My concern is, if consumption goes as low as the Greenbook suggests, what the retu rn on this capital spending will be.  Is it going into the right areas?  I was a little concerned when President Poole mentioned that the air freight company is expanding rapidly but the on-the-gro und delivery company is not expanding at all.  So are they going to have to invest in parachutes to get these in?  [Laughter ]  But that is precisely the concern that I have—that ca pital spending may not conform perfectly to what consumption demand is going to be.  We certainly saw this in  the late 1990s and early  2000s.  I’m just a bit worried about that now, especially given the pot ential tension between slowing consumption and robust investment growth. Now, regarding consumption—we’ve talked  about the potential support from lower energy prices and some positive wealth effect from stronger equity markets, but obviously housing is one key here. It’s a ke y partially in overall investment but also in the uncertainty that it causes in consumers’ minds.  Housing is one of the worst areas for data.  It’s very difficult for us to have any concept of what prices are doing because it’s not a market like any other.  We do have the Case-Schiller index, and we do have some  better indexes that people are now betting on, but they’re still very poor indi cators of prices rela tive to the indicators we have in other of uncertainty with respect to where prices are going.  That co ncerns me quite a bit because I think we just don’t have a good handle on it. Perm its and starts have continued to come down from where they were at our last meeting and ar e now at levels of the beginning of 2003 or even starting to slip into 2002. If they flatten out there, the housin g sector is still  historically reasonably good. But there’s no i ndication that we’re necessarily at a turning point and that things are going to flatten out. There is th e wealth effect, the di rect effect on people’s 82 of 132         consumption behavior of lower wealth going forw ard, and also the confidence effect.  We don’t have a perfect analogy with the previous times in which we’v e seen these housing downturns— we have a different context in that the economy is broadly more robust—and so I think it’s less likely that we’re going to see a major housing problem.   But I think it is a real risk, and we have to be sensitive to it. On the inflation outlook, we have to come back to transitory ve rsus more-persistent components, as many people have mentioned in the discussion.  Obviously, people are heartened that energy prices have come down, but I certainly would not put the same bet on the energy that. I think it’s appropriate in the Greenbook to use the market’s expectations.  What measure do we have other than market expectations? If  we did have a better measure, then we’d be running one of those hedge funds. However, there’ s a lot of uncertainty around that measure.  So I certainly don’t want to  bet on better inflation going forward just because we’ve suddenly seen a 15 percent decline in oil prices over the past six weeks.  Th at said, it’s heartening that energy prices are unlikely to lead to greater inflationary pressures go ing forward than those when we paused six weeks ago. The rise in compensation is obviously troublesome—not if you are an employee receiving the higher compen sation, but from our point of view.  However, a lot of tension is in those data because we have the compensation numbers versus the ECI.  There’s a big statistical discrepancy between gross domestic income and gr oss domestic product.  It’s possible that some of the increase in compensation will be revised away, and we’ll see actually higher productivity growth. We just don’t know, and it may be a while before we see it.  Also, as we discussed a lot 83 of 132           last time but not this time, the continuing fairly  wide margins that businesses are experiencing How much is uncertain, but that may be one potential offset. As many people have said, we can’t become complacent.  Inflation expectations have behaved reasonably well since we paused at the last meeting, wh ich is heartening in that the the longer term.  It’s hard to find evidence of increases in inflation expectations, but as many people have said, that does not mean that we don’t have to worry.  We have to worry a lot because the key is keeping those expectations we ll contained.  I think we’re in a situation in which we can do that. Slowing grow th is not going to give us more  of a benefit.  The flatness of the Phillips curve, which people have talked about,  is what the data have  been over the past ten to fifteen years in the United States and most other countries.  So  even if there is a bit more slowdown, we are not necessarily going to get the potential be nefit in significantly lower inflation pressures—maybe a little but not very mu ch.  So we still have to worry about the upside on inflation, and that’s why maintaining our  credibility is of utmost importance.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Mishkin. MR. MISHKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Fi rst, I just should sa y that it’s a great pleasure to return to the Federal Reserve System —I have so many friends here at the table and around the table. It’s also very nice to move to a slightly more comfortable chair.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. KROSZNER. It’s called the hot seat. [Laughter] MR. MISHKIN. Many of you know I have an  upbeat personality—some might actually say loud—but certainly upbeat. The way I look at the forecast  and the situation with the economy is quite positive in the se nse that what we’re seeing, real ly, is a return to normalcy and 84 of 132        a more balanced economy.  The excesses in the housing sector seem to be unwinding in an acceptable way, so I think it is quite reasonable in terms of the Greenbook forecast to think that the spillover here is not going to be a big prob lem because we’re actually moving resources from a sector that had too much going into it, into se ctors that need to have  more resources at the present time.  So in that sense, I’m actually quite positive.  The other thing that I am quite comfortable with in the Greenbook forecast—though, clearly, there’s uncertainty—is that we’re going to see a decelerating core inflation rate.  Furthermore, when we look at inflation expectations, they seem to be very well contai ned and seem also to have responded well to the pause at the last meeting. However, I should say that, although we’ve se en that inflation e xpectations are well anchored, there’s a question about whether they’re anchored at quite  the right level.  They seem to be anchored somewhere around 2½ percent on th e CPI, and that is proba bly with a differential between the CPI and the PCE of  about ½ percentage point, or 50 basis points.  It  still seems to be somewhat on the high side in terms of what many people on the Committee have expressed is their comfort zone.  So I think that is a concer n.  There is a significant probability that things somewhat wrong in terms of the housing sector.  If that happened, we might see much lower output growth.  There is a reasonable probability of recession.  It’s mentioned in the Greenbook.  I think your numbers are quite reas onable.  So in that context, we could actually have lower output, a wider output gap, and some actual decelera tion of inflation.  I agreed very much with the conclusion that you came to because it’s reasona ble to think that the long-run inflation we’re moving to is around 2 percent unless we get one of the scenarios with a lot more softness.  That 85 of 132        the deceleration is not going to go much be low the Greenbook forecast of around 2 percent by 2008 does cause me a bit of concern. I’m not sure that I would describe the risks as unbalanced.  For me, in terms of a forecast, probably I would be comfortable saying they’re bala nced.  However, I thin k inflation is too high in the forecast and, in that context, does require much more vigilance.  Of course, that will be reflected in the discussion later today. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Let me  just summarize quickly what I heard around the table, and then I’d like to make some additional commen ts of my own on the economy.  The sense is that, on the real side, there’s a two-tier econom y.  There’s the housing sector and maybe autos, and th ere’s everything else.  On hous ing, there’s agreement that a significant correction is occurri ng, but the views of the risks vary among participants.  In particular, some feel that this still could be a quite deep correction, and others say that the fundamentals, such as incomes, interest rates, and so on, will ultimately support housing.  With respect to the rest of the real economy, there we re some mixed reports; but on the whole, people characterized it as a full employment economy.  We’re generally more optimistic than the Greenbook both for later this year and for 2007. In  particular, people noted higher incomes and stock prices and lower oil prices, which s hould support consumption growth and business activity. At least for now, I heard only a few participants being particular ly concerned about the possible knock-on effects of housing on consumpti on and investment.  The labor market remains solid, and as we’ve been noting fo r a number of meetings, attract ing more highly skilled workers remains difficult. On inflation, some noted somewhat better intermeeting news, with  the possible exception of the higher compensation data.  But a lot of uncertainty was expresse d about where inflation 86 of 132           will go, reflecting in part our incomplete knowledge  of the determinants of inflation and also some mixed anecdotal evidence.  However, I hear  very clearly a definite unhappiness with the level of core inflation an d with the amount of time that is project ed to return it to a level of less than 2 percent.  The principal concern is that our  credibility will be damaged if inflation remains too high for too long. So I would summarize th e discussion—I hope r easonably accurately—by saying that inflation remains the pr edominant risk but there is still quite a bit of un certainty about the evolution of the economy in the next few quarters. Let me add a few comments to this—first about inflation and th en about the real economy.  I do believe that the intermeeting news on inflation was more good than bad, particularly relative to the fact that inflation is  a lagging indicator and that it would not have been incredibly surprising if we had go tten 0.3 readings the past two mont hs.  I’ll talk first about some of the positive news, and then I’ll addr ess some of the risks going forward.   First, there is evidence that the momentum of inflation has reversed.  When I gave my speech on June 5, which many of you followed up on, I emphasized the three- and six-month rates of inflation as indicating that an acceleration, a rising inflation pattern, was occurring.  It now appears that the three-month rate of inflation peaked in May.  So, for example, in May, the core PCE was 3.06 on a three-month basis; in July, it was 2.24.  Th e market-based core PCE was 3.00 in May, and in July it was 2.11. The core CP I was a high 3.79 in May, and as of the last reading in August, it was 2.95. So in some sens e the direction has turned, and the momentum has been broken, and I think that has been reflected in views in the marketplace.   Now, there hasn’t been much discussion of th e details of this inflation report, and I think it’s actually quite significant.  In  particular, a very important f actor in both the level and the change in inflation is owners’ equivalent rent (OER); we’ve discu ssed this issue before.  OER is 87 of 132     41 percent of core CPI and 19 percent of co re PCE.  Although OER has been decelerating recently, it’s still at a three-month rate of 4.4 perc ent, relative to an annua l rate of 2.66 percent in 2005. So that difference accounts for a great deal of the change between where we are today on a three-month basis versus where we were in  2005.  The good news is that OER and other measures of rent of shelter ha ve been coming down more quickly than many outside economists expected but in line with what our staff more or less expected; indeed, the number was 3 percent for August. So if it just stayed there or came down a bit more, we would see better short-term numbers for inflation going forward. Other positive news on inflation obviously includes energy and commodity prices.  For energy the dominant factors are supply-side factors over which we have no control—hurricanes or the lack thereof and geopolitical  factors.  But it’s also intere sting that metals and some other commodities are off their peaks. That suggests to me that, at least on the margin, some prospect of slowing economic activity and rising interest rates around the world may have taken a bit of the pressure off the commodity prices. We also have had some indication since the last meeting that the economy will be slower than we thought .  Clearly, the news on autos and housing was in a negative direction, and granting the flatness of the Phillips curve, all else being equal, that will take some pressure off utilization and pricing pow er.  Finally, I would argue that expectations are, in fact, really quite well contained. Around th is table, we’re getting used to talking about core inflation. The inflation that people see, of  course, is headline infl ation, and ultimately that should be our target as well. Over the past year or two, head line inflation has gone well above what we would consider reasonable levels, a nd yet TIPS indicators, su rvey indicators, and outside forecasters have not markedly changed thei r long-term inflation fore cast.  So I take the 88 of 132       credibility issue very seriousl y, but I don’t think that there is  much evidence yet that our credibility has been seriously impaired. On the negative side, the main piece of news was the higher compensation in the first and second quarters. There is not yet much evidence that labor costs are aff ecting inflation.  We’ve already discussed the issues with  the measurement of compensati on per hour.  Let me just note that, if you look at the component s of inflation that have moved the most, you get things like rent, airfares, used cars, and things of that so rt.  You don’t see much movement in services, for example, which are more labor intensive.  So I do n’t think that labor cost s have yet infected the inflation rate; indeed, we know there’s a weak co rrelation between these la bor cost measures and inflation. However, and let me be clear about th is, I think that the key risk to our inflation forecast is that markets will be tighter, labor mark ets will be tighter, and wages will grow more quickly, and that will produce more inflation than  we would like.  So I would summarize the inflation situation as having had some modest im provement, some encouragement, but I certainly agree with the general sentiment around the table th at the level of core in flation is certainly too high. On the real side, we paused at the last meeting to observe the lagged effects on real activity of our previous interest rate moves.   The evidence suggests that, indeed, interest-sensitive sectors did worsen over the interm eeting period.  We saw the second significant point, I agree that the economy except for housing is reasonably st rong and that there are factors supporting consumption part icularly, going forward.  So as we look forward, I think there are two issues.  The first is how severe the contraction in housing will be.  To be honest, we don’t really know.  We’re  talking, again, about 89 of 132                                                       an asset price correction, and it’s difficult, in pr inciple, to know how far that will adjust.  The second issue is how much spillover there will be from any housing correction to the rest of the economy.  I don’t have quite as much confidence as  some people around the table that there will be no spillover effect.  Any spillover effect would be a lagged effect, and it remains to be seen how much effect there might be.  But I agree that the economy except for housing and autos is still pretty strong, and we do not yet see any significant spillover from housing. Please look at the figure  that was distributed.2  I want to talk a b it about the risks in both directions as we think about polic y.  Let me just describe the tw o panels to you and then draw a conclusion from them.  The top panel shows th e four-quarter difference in the unemployment rate—that is, the unemployment rate in the fourth  quarter of this year minus the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of last year, going back to about 195 0.  The blue bars show recession periods. The dashed line is at zero, and the solid horizon tal line is at 0.3 percentage point.  What you see is that, without exception, every time since 1950 that the unemployment rate has risen as much as 0.3 percentage point over a year, it has continued to rise, and we’ve seen a recession.  That suggests that having unemployment rise just a few tenths and keeping it there is not quite so easy as our linear models might suggest.  In th e bottom panel, you see four-quarter changes in the growth of real GDP. The dotted line show s zero, and the solid line arbitrarily shows 2 percent real growth. Again, these are four-qua rter differences.  With the minor exception of 1956, again in no case was real GDP growth below 2 percent sustained for four quarters without an NBER recession.  I think a very  interesting case is 1995-96—the famous soft landing that was engineered in the mid-1990s.  You’ll notice the line just touches the 2 percent zone without crossing it. [Laughter] 2 The figure to which Chairman Bernanke refers is appended to this transcript (appendix 2). 90 of 132                                                           So what am I saying here?  I’m only saying th at, if we believe that we need to have output below potential to help arrest inflation pr essures, it is a delicat e operation, and we may have a very narrow channel to navigate as we go  forward.  We should pay very close attention to how the economy is evolving at this particular moment because I think the uncertainty and the potential nonlinearity at this ju ncture are greater than what we normally face.  I’ll stop there, and we can begin our second round. Oh, I’m sorry—Vincent.  [Laughter]

MR. REINHART. I only speak when asked, Mr. Chairman.  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That is a good practice.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Since when?  [Laughter] MR. REINHART.3  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and some participants. [Laughter] Over the intermeeting period, tumbling oil pr ices, better-behaved  inflation, and the minutes of the August meeting, which conveye d a more widespread disinclination to tighten than investors suspected, pulled nominal interest rates lower.  As can be seen by the solid line in the upper left panel of your first exhibit, the rate on three-month Eurodollar futures expiring this December declined a touch, on net, and is now consistent with the federal funds rate remaining at 5¼ percent for the remainder of the year. Investors seem to expect policy easi ng thereafter, in that the contract expiring one year later has a rate about ½ percentage  point lower.  This can be seen most clearly by the black line in the upper right panel, which show s that the path expected for the federal funds rate over the next tw o years has a decidedly negative slope.   As indicated by the shift from the black do tted to the black solid line in the lower left panel, this revision to policy expectations was associ ated with a r oughly parallel step downward in the term st ructure of nominal Treasury yields over the intermeeting period. The yield curve for indexed secu rities moved up closer to its nominal counterpart—the shift from the dotted to  the solid red line—implying that the difference, inflation compensation, declined.   These relative movements can be made more precise by putting them in terms of changes in implied forward rates, as at th e right.  Nominal fo rward rates (the top panel) declined in a relatively uniform fashion, from 8 to 15 basis points.  The rotation up in the real yield curve, however,  was associated with sizable increases in short-term real forward rates and declin es at longer horizons .  The arithmetic difference between the two is plotted in  the bottom right panel:  Inflation compensation fell noticeably at short horiz ons, but the decline tapered off as the maturity lengthened.   3 Materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). 91 of 132        One way to tie these disparate movements in to a neat package is to argue that the substantial decline in oil prices in recent  weeks represents a disinflationary impetus that is anticipated to be only partly offset by you.  That is, nominal rates will move lower but by less than the drop in  inflation so as to keep re al interest rates higher for a time.  In this story, the dec line in oil prices represents an opportunity to disinflate—an opportunity that investors exp ect you to take by being slow to lower nominal interest rates. The same story, however, can take on a da rker hue if it is ar gued that the fall in the prices of oil and other commodities ev idenced a slowing in global activity brought on at least in part by your previous 17 po licy firmings—that is, this opportunity for disinflation could be one  of your own making.   Either explanation—one of omissi on or one of commission—produces a moderation in spending and a drif t down in inflation that would seem to be consistent with holding the funds rate at 5¼ percent for now, a possibility examined in more detail in exhibit 2.  At its August mee ting, the Committee assessed the risks to be such that it could hold policy unchanged gi ven its expectation that growth would moderate and inflation declin e.  The information received since then would seem to strengthen that determination.  As shown in  the top left panel, inflation compensation measured in the Treasury ma rket is about unchanged at the longer horizon (the red line) and distinctly lower in the near term (the black line).  How much of this decline represents a drop in inflation expectations as opposed to a decline in inflation risk premiums is hard to say, but the evidence at the right may be suggestive.  Merrill Lynch conducts a monthly survey of globa l fund managers about their views of macroeconomic risks and portfolio inclina tions.  More than 200 of them typically reply, and last month an increased share of th em were of the view that inflation would be lower, rather than higher, than in recent months.  This view seems to be underpinned by the expectation that economic growth will moderate so that resource slack will open up, perhaps as in the staff fo recast in the middle left panel.  Indeed, when asked about global economic growth, the fund managers su rveyed by Merrill Lynch mostly expected it to slow, as at th e middle right, with mo re of them of that view than earlier in the year.   As can be seen directly below, the slowi ng is not anticipated by investors to be so precipitous as to tip the world economy in to recession.  More than 90 percent of the managers view such an outcome as unlikel y.  Thus, they wouldn’t seem to be putting much weight on the flatness of the yield curv e, plotted at the bottom left, as a leading indication of recession—nor would you if you’re  inclined to keep policy on hold.  In that regard, as the chart makes clear, the yield curve has had some predictive power for recession over the past forty years.  For instance, the inversion of the term structure in 2000 was sending a signal that, in retrospect , might have warranted a response. This indicator may seem less compelling now for two reasons.  First, a flattening yield curve has sent false signa ls as well over the y ears, including of recessions that didn’t occur in the mid- 1990s.  Second, much of the downward tilting of the term structure seems due to a declin e in term premiums, which might be a sign of reduced uncertainty rather than a sign of increased economic vulnerabilities.   92 of 132           Indeed, some Committee members may be far from seeing the economy as vulnerable—perhaps to the point of inclin ing them toward firming policy 25 basis points, as in exhibit 3. In pa rticular, financial market participants do not seem to have heard the message of the August statement that the risks were tilted toward higher policy rates. Rather, as shown in the top left panel by the spread of the December 2007 Eurodollar futures contract below the December 2006 one, about 50 basis points of easing is expected next year. This expectation of ease may be contributing to low credit spreads (the top center panel) and the recent rise in equity prices (the top right panel). This financial impetus might be  seen as a reason th at spending will not moderate sufficiently to make a noticeable dent in inflation.   Even if those expectations are wrung out of financial ma rket prices over time—as in the staff forecast—the resulting path of inflation may not be acceptable to the Committee.  As shown in the middle panel,  core PCE inflation is projected by the staff to remain above 2 percent through the end of 2008, which would mark the fifth consecutive year of such an outcome.  Th e survey expectations of CPI inflation— plotted at the bottom left—similarly remain well above 2 percent.  While survey responses came down over the intermee ting period, you might discern a slight uptrend in the past few years that could be taken as an erosion of the public’s confidence. In such a circumstance, me mbers may believe that more-acceptable progress toward price stability will likel y involve a firmer stance of policy, a judgment that would be strengthened if  you thought the spike in the growth of compensation per hour plotted at the right was not as likely  to roll back as the staff projects. The Bluebook lived up to its title, “Moneta ry Policy Alternatives,” by offering the five different options given in exhibit 4—three formal ones and two variants (which are shaded) that were discussed in the text. If your intent is to solidify current market expectations of easing, switc hing to balanced risks, as  in A, probably has some appeal. The words of alternative B were  designed to leave market rates about unchanged, whereas B+ emphasizes that tighten ing is more likely than easing.  It doesn’t really say anything ne w, but we thought the force of repetition might get the attention of market participants.  The alte rnative labeled C- couples tightening with a removal of the rate bias, signaling th at the Committee may be done, whereas C imposes considerable additional restraint by retaining an assessment of upside risks even after firming.   Your last exhibit repeats table 1 from the Bluebook with a minor change noted in red in the second row.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We are ready for the go-round now. Would anyone like to speak? President Poole. 93 of 132           

[SECTION]

 MR. POOLE. Am I the only taker to be number one?  [Laughter]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to start with tw o observations.  First, the distri bution of the market’s outlook for the federal funds rate six months ahead—and the briefing paper that appeared in my hotel room last night has that shown on exhibit 1—is pretty symmetrical, although  it actually has a bit more probability weight on declines in the rate than increases.  But roughly spea king, it accords with my own view—a one-third chance that we will stay where we are, a on e-third chance that it will be appropriate to ease, and a one-third chance that we w ill want to increase the rate.  I come out with a very symmetrical view myself.  I think of the views around the table—some people are probably there, some people are probably skewed on one side  and some on the other side, but I come out very much in the middle. My second observation continues a point that Tim Geithner made a few minutes ago.  I had several conversations at Jackson Hole with Wall St reet economists and jour nalists, and they said, quite frankly, that they really do not believe that our effective inflation target is 1 to 2 percent.  They believe we have morphed into 1½ to  2½ percent, and no one thought th at we were really going to do anything over time to bring it down to 1 to 2.  I think that is very unfortunate because so many of us have talked about 1 to 2.  Also, it seems to me that in the future it would be easy for people to say, “Well, it is going to be inconvenient.  Let’s just sort  of settle at 2 to 3.”  They have already said that they would be at 1½ to 2½  effectively by the behavi or of the Committee.  Now,  if we get data in the coming months that are unfortuna te on the inflation side and lead us to increase our inflation forecast in the absence of any fu rther policy action, I would certainly  be on the side saying that we ought to act.  We shoul d firm policy so that we do  not allow the forecast infl ation to rise from where it is now. 94 of 132           One reason that I do not want the explicit referenc e to housing to be in the statement is that I would take that pos ition even if housing were co ntinuing to struggle, because I th ink it is extremely important that we not allow inflation to ratchet u p.  If housing is a casualt y of that policy, we had better accept that situation.  I would not like to se e a mixed market signal because I would not want the market to believe that conti nuing weakness in housing would de flect us from acting as necessary to keep inflation from rising further.  I think the explicit reference to housing in the statement conditions the market to think about our policy going fo rward in the wrong way. At the same time, there is a clear possibility  that we could see data in comi ng months that would be weaker than we now antic ipate in the Greenbook forecast. What I know about forecasting error says that you have to think that coming in weaker on the real economy is a real, live possibility. I hope that we do not get unfort unate news on inflation an d a downside on the real economy together, but  I do not rule out  that possibility. I think it is unlikely, if  we receive substantially weak da ta on the real economy, that we would be raising rates into  a recession.  But quite frankly, I would like for us  to condition the market to accept this symmetrical view of the risks that we face going forward and for us not to have language in our stat ement that tilts us to ward tightening.  My  own sense is that an asymmetric tilt toward tightening would not serve us  well should we get downside surprises in the real economy.  Indeed, we should be quite happy to see longer-ter m rates weaken in  the event of w eak data on the real economy. To have the market respond that way helps to serve as a built-in stabilizer for economic activity.  It would tend to support housing and other interest-sensitive sectors, and we should encourage rather than discou rage that response in the market. Let’s see. What else do I wa nt to say here?  I would observ e that the Greenbook forecast of a prolonged period of an inverted  yield curve has no historical precedent.  Usually the yield curve is 95 of 132        inverted in the proces s of going from here to there, and yo u do not just sort of  settle there.  So I think that this situation is likely to be resolved ei ther in the direction of higher long-term rates, as news on the real economy or infl ation comes through in that direc tion or in the direction of lower short-term rates, for re asons I was just outlining ; and I don’t know whic h direction it will be. My view of the current stance of  policy is that it is  moderately restrict ive.  Money growth, whether measured by MZM (Money Zero Maturity) or by M2, has be en modest, and in fact, real balances have been flat to declining for a year or more, which would be a rather traditional sign that our policy is restri ctive.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Moskow. 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  I appreciate your passing out this sheet and talking about it. I think the lesson here is that these things do not al ways go as gradually as forecast, and once things get going in one direction, th ere is more momentum th an is built into our longer-term forecasts. In terms of policy, as you know I would have preferred rais ing rates at our last meeting, and I think the overall contours of the resource gap a nd the inflation forecast ar e pretty much the same as they were last time.  I still think that policy w ill need to be tightened further to br ing inflation back into my comfort zone  within a reasonable period of time.  But given our decision to pause last month, I do not feel that  we should move today.  We told the public that  we paused to assess incoming data, and I think it requires  more than one meeting’ s worth of data to assess that.  In fact, if we did move today, it would be  a signal that we are ju st reacting to little snip pets of information, and we are trying to dissuade people from thinki ng that.  But I am con cerned about how markets viewed our last meeting.  We ta lked last time about a hawkish pa use.  Generally the markets didn’t interpret it that way. They ma y be more optimistic about inflation, but as  we know, the futures 96 of 132                market is expecting us to cut rates.  I share a sense of what President Poole talked about—that many of us have talked about; they think our zone is somewhere higher. So when you look at these op tions from A to Z—A to C [l aughter], there are lots of options—that Vince has distributed, I am in the B+  category.  But I think we should not put that phrase “policy is more likely to firm than ease going forward” in the statement.  However, I think that it is the sense of this Committee, and I thin k it should be reflected in the minutes.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Stern. 

[SECTION]

MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Ch airman.  Well, so far it looks  as though our decision to pause at the last meeting was a sound one, and I emphasize “so far” because we obviously have not received a lot of additional information.  I thin k the reaction in the financial markets has been encouraging in that, as best as I can judge, the ne ws was received that it is a sensible decision, inflation expectations have remained well anchored, and so forth.  My take on the incoming data has not changed my view of the decisi on to pause last time, which I favored, and I think we are well positioned at the moment, especially when we continue to allow fo r the lags presum ably stemming from our previous actions.  So I favor staying where we are today. As far as the language is concerned, I fa vor the language of alterna tive B, as wr itten.  Vince indicated that perhaps financial market participants  did not quite receive the message, but I thought the message was fairly cl ear.  It talks about “any additional firming,” which is qu ite explicit and allows, as far as I can  see, flexibility if we need it to go in the ot her direction with th e last phrase in the risk assessment in section 4.  So I am comfortable w ith the language and thin k that at this stage we should just stay where we are.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher. 97 of 132             

[SECTION]

 MR. FISHER.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I am somewhere between Mr . Moskow and our distinguished president from Minneapolis, but I am biased toward B+.  My board, as I indicated earlier, was in favor of ratcheting up the discount ra te.  One of their concerns  that I did not voice in our discussion previously was ab out how permanent or, rather, how temporary this reduction in energy price is likely to  be, and as you know, we have a heavy weight of significant oil operators on our board.  The only statement one can make with assurance—and Karen referr ed to this during the analysis period—is th at we are likely to have volatility.  We ca nnot take or assume great confidence in terms of continued direction. In alternative B, sec tion 3, the words that I find most objectionable are “reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices.”  It is a little too soon to tell, and the language send s a mixed signal because we spent, under our previous leadership, a tremendous amount of time emphasizing core PCE, which excludes energy.  I take your point, which is absolutely appropriate in my view, that we need to be aware that th e rest of the world looks at the CPI an d does not necessarily think about core PCE ex-food and ex-energy because they  have to eat and they have to drive.  I would be in favor of the B+ column, Mr. Chairman .  I would consider striking the word s “policy is more likely to firm than ease going forward, ” but Vince makes a good point:  There is some value to the force of repetition. What I wo rry about most is expectations creep, a nd I do agree that what I am hearing from outside and what  I heard not just at Jack son Hole but elsewh ere is that we are too willing to accept an inflation target that ra nges up to 3 percent.  I would be adamantly agai nst accepting that kind of inflation.  So I think it is important to reite rate our bias and to do it  with a deft hand.  We should not do it in such a way th at tilts us into the ri sk that you pointed ou t in your charts of triggering recession, but we noneth eless should indicate that we are fi rm.  So I am a B+ man, even at this table of A+ students. 98 of 132           

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank yo u, Mr. Chairman.  I’m in favor of maintaining the current stance of policy.  I think that is the best chance we have at  this juncture for having growth modestly below the growth rate of potential a nd inflation gradually ebbing .  I am not as dissatisfi ed with that path as an energy shock, a gradual decline in inflation is about as good as we can expect to do, and I do not think that is going to im pair our credibility if pe ople see that happening. Now, I admit that that credibilit y may be built around a slightly higher  inflation rate than others want to see.  In that regard, I think we are in desperate ne ed of the conversation we want to have at the next meeting about what our targets should be; how we should enunciate them; and once we are away from any target if we  do enunciate it, how we should ge t back.  But at this point I do not see any risk to our credibility from something th at looks like the path th at I expect to happen with keeping policy unchanged for now. Until housing weakens further and begins to spill over into other sectors, the ri sk to our dual mandate comes primarily on  the inflation side.  So I am very comfortable with the inflation risk language.  I do not think our reference to housing in section 2 undercuts our sense that we are worried about inflation and would act  against it.  I think it helps explain secti on 3, which says why we think inflation would moderate.  So it does not bother me that much. I am somewhat puzzled by the be havior of financial markets w ith respect to the expected policy. I am not puzzled so much by the downward  tilt.  That is roughly consistent with growth below potential and a gradua l retreat of inflation and is not all that different from some of the Taylor rule simulations in the Bluebook, including some of those with a 1½ percent inflation target.  It is also consistent with the Committee’s past actio ns judging from the forecast -based rule.  But it does 99 of 132         not seem to give much weight to  the upside inflation risk that  we sense or to the Committee’s priority of seeking assurance th at inflation is modera ting.  More perplexing—and I think Vice Chairman Geithner brought this u p—is the apparent certainty with which market participants seem to view this expected path; they do not seem to  share our uncertainty or at least my uncertainty about the future course of polic y.  At some point, e xpected volatilities will ri se, and some market participants will suffer lo sses; but for now the implied path of rates or the low expected volatility is not really impeding our ability  to achieve our goals, and I would not attempt to use the announcement to change expectations in markets.  I do not th ink they are so far off that they’re stopping us from getting where we  want to go.  So I would not  favor B+.  I would favor the language of B.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, ba sed on my assessment of th e economic outlook, I think we should maintain the funds  rate at 5¼ percent, which as others  have said is modestly restrictive, and I counsel what I would refer to as rational patience here as we work through this.  I continue to hold the view that the current policy stance, along with the lagged effects of  past tightening, will lead to a moderation of inflat ion going forward—and that does no t deny that upside risks to inflation do, in fact, remain.   Just quickly, I would like to say that I think credibility is extrem ely important for the Federal Reserve and that we risk the issue of credibility mu ch more when we  are at 1 percent than when we are at 5¼ percent, which is wh ere we are now, in terms of upsid e inflationary risk.  We are moderately restrictive, and we do not want to overreact.  With that in mind, although there are also downside risks to growth, I want to  be very clear to the markets and to the public th at any near-term easing in policy is not likely.  Indeed, I believe, first, that we should maintain our current policy 100 of 132            stance until we see evidence of significant systematic  declines in inflation.  We should make that clear. Second, if we get evidence that inflation is not moderating, I would be prepared at that point to support additional tighten ing; but I think we should have that evid ence before we reengage in any policy tightening. On the press statement, I am in favor of B+.  We should be very firm about our inflation position and about our commitment to bringing inflation down.  We  should not overr eact; and with the moderately tight policy that we have now, we can see in flation come down systematically over time.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Guynn. 

[SECTION]

MR. GUYNN. Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I don’t know how we would rationalize or explain a departure today from the pause that we deci ded on at our last meetin g.  Also, I think that what we have learned si nce our last meeting does not substantially alter our  medium-term forecast. Therefore, I strongly favor another hold decision today, along with a stat ement that continues to make it very clear that, if our forecast changes, especially with regard to the expectation of moderating inflation, our policy pos ition would also be reassessed.  I also want to echo the earlie r observation of President Stern on the evidence in the memos that were circulated before the meeting.  Despite the l ack of correlation betwee n resource utilization and inflation and a decline in the influence of ener gy prices on core infla tion, we continue to put considerable weight on these rela tionships in our statem ents.  I think there are issues here that deserve a good discussion  at some point.  Finally, it seems clear that we are really strugg ling to understand infl ation dynamics and see a need for a more empirically ro bust framework to guide our deci sionmaking.  I assu me this area will receive even more research emphasis and will  be a fundamental part of the upcoming debate 101 of 132           you will have on how to target, forecast, and talk abou t inflation and the infl ation outlook.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  I fa vored a pause at the last meeting, and I haven’t really heard or seen anything since then that would cause me to change that view.  Consequently, maintaining the pause seems like th e right thing to do, and I favor the language in alternative B in communicatin g that decision.  I would also like to  add that I share the concern that most have expressed today that the trajectory of inflation may not head do wnward fast enough.  However, I favor the current pol icy stance because I believe that the rates we have already implemented will bring the inflation rate down and because,  as I said earlier, overtightening when the economy appears to be moderating more than we an ticipated even just a c ouple of months ago is a concern to me.  Mr. Chai rman, the chart that you handed out t oday reaffirms that concern.  Even though I am co nvinced that the infl ation rate will fall, I am less convinced about how much and when.  Right now, I am satisfied with breaking the momentum in th e inflation process and will wait to see whether the modera tion in the economy does stabilize.  I can envisi on, as others have said today, a point in the futu re when our policy will ha ve to be more ambitious  to bring the rate of inflation down over time.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Plosser. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At our last meet ing, my inclination was to favor an additional 25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate.  In my view, there has been very little change in the economi c case for some addition al policy firming.  The incoming data have not persuaded me to think that growth would be cons iderably below trend in ’07, although I do think that there will be moderation over the next couple of quarters.  I do  not think that a 25 basis point 102 of 132           change in interest rates one way or the other will have much effect on the housing market at this point, and I do not believe th at we should stand in the way of the adjustment to the housing sector to move to a more sustai nable level of activity. Thus far the Committee has main tained its credibility, and long-run inflation expectations have been stable.  That is very go od.  My concern, howeve r, is that the longer we tolerate inflation above our comfort zone, th e more risk we have that those ex pectations will become unhinged.  Their becoming unhinged, as I noted in my earlier comments, could lead to some very unpleasant outcomes, and we would find regain ing our credibility very difficult.  Becaus e of the weakness in residential investment, a rise in the fed funds rate  could be viewed as potentially costly; but that potential cost increases the value of the actions  as a signal of the Fed’s commitment and its effectiveness in keeping inflation expectations firmly in check. As the discussions around this table in August and today show, reasonable people doing sound economic analysis can have different view s about whether further policy firming will be needed.  I understand and respect both  sides of that argument.  My goal  at this point is to stress, as many people have stressed, that we  shouldn’t lose sight of the importance of our credibility and to state that I am unhappy with the level of core inflation and with the pace at whic h it seems to be convince ourselves at each juncture of the decision making process that at the margin we can risk sacrificing a little credibility to achieve some other loosely defined and perhap s illusive objective, we may find our capital significantly depleted.  On ce that is obvious in th e data, it is too late. The decision to pause in  August was a close call, but the pa use cannot be ignored, I think, in statement gives us the fl exibility to raise rates, I think doing so today would pose a very different 103 of 132          and difficult communication challenge.  I argued last  time that, if the data for August and September continued to evolve as they had in  June and July, it would be hard to change our policy stance if we paused in August. That seems to be exactly where we are.  I might argue that another six weeks of inflation above our comfort zone ha s increased the risk to  our credibility, but I think that initiating a rate increase so soon after pausing, given the da ta we have received, could be misinterpreted and pose its own risk to ou r credibility for sound monetary policymaking. Thus, I come down on the side th at it would be better to remain  on hold for this meeting but to have strong enough  language in today’s statemen t to enable us to  initiate rate incr eases in the near future unless the incoming data are significantly di fferent from what we’ve expected.  The language in alternative B+ comes close to doin g that.  It is important that we co ntinue to say, as in section 4, that inflation risks remain.  I woul d not like to cite factor s restraining aggregate de mand in the list of things that would potentially help moderate inflation.  I do not th ink we can measur e the tradeoffs between growth and inflation precisely enough to  depend on a moderate  deceleration to bring inflation down over the forecast pe riod.  Moreover, and even more important to me, such language fosters a belief among the public an d others that we have a desire an d an ability to engage in fairly precise fine-tuning.   I am opposed to alternative A la nguage.  First, I do not think that we can say with any great confidence that inflation risks a ppear to have diminished.  Sec ond, I do not think that saying “downside risks to growth have become more signific ant” is helpful at this point.  Saying that is likely to lower the expected path of future interest ra tes, as has been pointed out, and to reinforce the idea that interest rates are likely to come down sooner than is built in to our forecast.  To the extent that the assessment-of-risk language is supposed to help with the public ’s understanding of the 104 of 132            monetary policy process over the coming months, I think the language in alternative A would be counterproductive. Finally, I would like to reiterate a point that has been made around the table several times. When we look at the longer-term su rvey data and at what  the markets are saying, they seem to be reading the fact that we do not actua lly have a target zone of 1 to 2 percent.  The target zone is really communicate that fairly directly rather than speaking one way and acting another way.  Of course, as Governor Kohn and several others mentione d, that point brings us right back to the communication issue, whic h I think will be a very important ag enda item in the coming meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. After looking clos ely at the new data since the last meeting, I do not see a compelling reason to materi ally alter my asse ssment of policy.  I still th ink that the fed funds rate should be 5½ percent to bring core inflatio n down rapidly enou gh.  My preference is based on an assumption that we want to brin g core inflation down to 1½.  That is how I think things through when I come into these meetings—I have not been told to do otherwise—and, without a firmer policy path, I think that core inflat ion is likely to decline no more rapidly than the glacial pace of the Greenbook. I acknowledge that there are risk s to real growth in the outlo ok and that raising rates may add to those risks.  But the risks strike me as  tolerably small partly because my baseline forecast stays a little further away than the Greenbook from your point-of-no-return thresholds, which I think are legitimate concerns.  But since you have put that on the table and President Poole has echoed this, let me add to his st atement that tolerating a ri se in inflation to avoid a point of no return and 105 of 132        recession is, I think, a gr ave error, and I think that the experien ce of the ’70s is strong evidence of that. Besides that, I think these risks can be significantly lowered to the extent that tighter policy shifts the public’s expect ations regarding ou r future conduct.  A lot of comments around the table just now have indicated that th e public has substantial uncert ainty about whether 1½, 2, or 2½ percent is where we are really in terested in bringing inflation to. I am not as concerned about a rise in inflation right now.  We have experienced increases in core inflation in response to en ergy price shocks, and I am concerned about the possible effects on core inflation from the next round of fluctuations in the oil market .  The process is repeatable, and just like the inflation dy namics that the Greenbook staff analyzed, the response to energy price shocks is a reduced form, and it embodies what people expect about how we are going to react to those shocks.  I think the major da nger is that we allo w core inflation to pe rsist above 2¼ percent for a substantial time. The longer we allow th at, the more likely it is that the public’s expectations will collapse around a high rate of inflation and the hard er it will be to bring core inflation down to 1½ percent, if that is what we settle on wanting to do.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Minehan. 

[SECTION]

MS. MINEHAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I noted earlier, given the relatively subdued pace of incoming data, given the range of uncertainties that have been talked about, and given that we have alr eady paused, I would contin ue to pause.  I thought the expositio n you gave about the point of no  return was close to my own thinking , without my quantifying it in that effective fashion.  There are down side risks, and I do take serious ly the Greenbook’s forecast of slow growth.  However, if  we do continue our paus e, we need to co ntinue being fairly strong in the way we communicate.  Now, I have gone back and forth about how ex actly to do that .  I am a bit attracted to Michael Moskow’s form ulation of being essentially in the area of B+ but having the 106 of 132           statement look like B—that’s the way I interpret it—but also having the minutes emphasize the concern that I sense around the table about inflation risks going forward. I, too, was a bit disappointed in  the market reaction partly to our statement but mostly to the minutes of last time.  Perhaps the market was over ly influenced by the incomin g data at the time the minutes were released, but it did seem to think that we  thought the risks of rising inflation had moderated considerably.  I don’t think that’s a gene ral view of the Committee.   I take seriously the concerns that many have raised about our continued seeming compla cency about the level of price escalation over a fairly long period—four or five y ears or so—unless our preference is for inflation that centers on 2 or 2½ percent ra ther than on 1½ percent.  Personally, I don’t see anything wrong with 2 or 2½, and I do not know  whether we have any compelling data that suggest that a lower range is obviously preferable. I remember the days in which we  had inflation at  a little above 1 percent, and we were really concer ned about deflation.  So I think a lot of ins and outs and ups and downs here are getting kind of confused. In that regard, I never thought I would be looking forward to yet a nother discussion of inflation targeting.  [L aughter]  I think that the tension between the co mments of many people regarding a comfort zone of 1 to 2 percent and the expected slow m oderation of inflation that is implicitly embedded in our public comments and in our public fore casts over the next couple of years is becoming more evident to market analysts along the lines  of what several people have mentioned.  There probably is a need for more clarity here, and so  I guess I am looking forward to it. [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Th ank you.  I assure you that th e minutes will re flect the tenor of the meeting.  President Yellen. 107 of 132            

[SECTION]

 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It is still too early to know  whether our current policy stance will succ eed in lowering inflation to  an acceptable level over time, but the data since our last meeting reassured me that our decision to step  off the escalator was wise, and I think we should remain on the sidelines today.  Recent  inflation readings have contained no adverse surprises.  Inflation expectations remain contained.  I think the inflation outlook is slightly improved because of the reduction in energy and commodity prices, and growth during the second half of the year now appears quite likely to fall short of tr end.  I view the risks to the attainme nt of our objectives as more balanced than they were in Au gust, and I certainly judg e the downside risks to growth to have increased.  Your  discussion of nonlinearities, Mr . Chairman, was interesting, and it is important to be se nsitive to that possibility .  That said, I think that the upside risk s to inflation still outweigh the downside risks to grow th.  With inflation projected to remain uncomfortably high over a sustained period and with the eco nomy still likely opera ting beyond potential, I favor alternative B and think it’s importan t that we do at least hint at an upw ard bias for fed funds rate changes. With respect to the language, I pr efer alternative B to alternative B+ becaus e the latter points to a greater possibility of a near-term tightening.  I am concerned, ho wever, that mark ets appear to think that the fed funds rate  has peaked and that cuts seem very likely by next spring .  I do not think alternative B would shake th at view in the market.  In contrast , I find myself mo re in agreement with the Greenbook baseline for the fed funds rate, suggesting that we’re likely to want to hold it near its present level for some time to bring infl ation down.  Now, market s obviously may turn out to be right.  But if, as the months go by, developments rais e our confidence in the Greenbook baseline view, then I think it woul d be useful for us to think a bout ways to signal to markets— possibly through some forward-lo oking language—an extended policy path in somewhat clearer terms than any of the options in table 1 curre ntly allow. 108 of 132

MR. KROSZNER. From a prudent risk-manag ement perspec tive, I think we made the appropriate decision to pause at the previous  meeting, and again fr om a risk-management perspective, I think we should continue to pause at  the moment.  Certainly there are downside risks to the outlook that we have talked about.  The lagged effects of the in terest rate increa ses are still not in, and there is a lot of uncertainty with respect to the housing market. With respect to the way the markets reacted  to our statement from last time, I am somewhere between President Stern and the person formerly known as the Vice Chairman of the FOMC, Governor Kohn.  [Laughter]  I think that the markets reacted  broadly reasonabl y in terms of the level of expectations to what we had said, but I find it a bit ha rd to understand their apparent thinking that there is little uncerta inty about where we ar e going or where the ec onomy is going.  So I am somewhere between those two.  Certainly I ha ve had people say, as many people around the table have heard people say, “Where exactly is your comfort zone on inflation?   Is it moving up?”  But if you look at the surveys, yo u do not see that; and if you look  at the TIPS spreads and other places where people ar e putting their money where th eir mouth is, you ’re not really se eing that.  So I am not quite sure how to  weigh those reactions.  Obviously I do not want inflation expectations to become unhinged:  That would be very, very costly, and certainly there is a no nlinearity in trying to put the hinge back when the hinge has come off.  But th e situation we are in is very different from that. Even though I think that we  need to convey to the markets our concerns about inflation risks, I would not favor alternative B+ beca use it takes away some  of our flexibility go ing forward and also suggests more certainty about what we will do next.  Ther e was a lot of uncertai nty around the table, and our concern that the markets are thinking that we are too ce rtain might push us in the other direction. 109 of 132                 However, I would like to put on the table a suggestion for a change.  In alternative B, section 3, we have added the phras e “on balance” in the first senten ce:  “Readings on  core inflation have been elevated on balance.”  The innovati on of the two words “on balance” is perfectly reasonable because, as the Chairman  said, the data on inflation sinc e the last meeting have probably been slightly on the lower side of expectations rather  than on the higher side and many of the three-month measures of inflation peaked earlier.  But I am a bit concerned that , with just the small amount of data that we have seen recently, by sa ying “on balance” we are making the qualification that it is only on balance and that  we are not so co ncerned about the elevated le vels.  I think this also reflects some of the concerns of the people around the table.  So I put out for discussion that we consider deleting “on balance” because, from my prudent ri sk-management perspective, I think we shouldn’t be making a particular co mmitment about that  at the moment. I would object to the B+  language; I think it ta kes away some of our flexibility, which is not a prudent thing to do at this time .  On the point that was raised a bout the difference between the first sentence and the subsequent sentence in the discus sion of energy, I think the energy discussion clearly relates to headline infla tion and that there certainly is so me effect of energy prices on headline inflation. I do not think it is inappr opriate to acknowledge that at that place.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Than k you.  Governor Bies. 

[SECTION]

MS. BIES.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I support no change to day.  I do not believe there has been enough information to change my mi nd from the last meeting.  I support alternative B because I am concerned that B+ is more of a commitment that  we are going to do something, and I am not ready to go that far.   However, I agree with Presid ent Minehan’s comments that the long-term inflation level above 2 percent, especially now that we have 2008 in the forecast, is worrisome because of wher e we are with resource utilization and potential growth and the potential 110 of 132               conflict that I see there.  I also  remember that I was very nervous when inflation was dropping.  It was below 1 percent.  Going between the short-run spikes down an d short-run spikes up gets one nervous. So not only do  we need to think about the range, but also we need to th ink about what we mean by the medium term in whic h to gauge it.  I look  forward to this discussion because it may help me put those thoughts together at the next m eeting.  But for today’s m eeting, I favor alternative B as it is and no change in rates.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  Governor Warsh. 

[SECTION]

MR. WARSH.  Thank you,  Mr. Chairman.  Given our decisi on at the last meeting, I favor maintaining the pause today, and I favor alternative B.  The judgment to paus e, as well as the language around that, does in fact constrain our flexibility, and I think most of us re cognized that going into our last meeting. In reviewing the language, I think that B+ has some superficial appeal, but the appeal really is in understanding that’s what we meant to say or that’s how we meant th e markets to react last time.  That is, I do not think our statement today s hould redo, correct, or try to reinterpret the last one.  We had one shot in August.  We now have a shot in September.  Some of the appeal of B+ is trying to drive those market reac tions that we expected.  Given wh at the market ha s done, it strikes me that changing the language about what we said last time carries a large burden.  The language in the statement represents a relative ly blunt instrument, and our view that it is somehow nuanced or that we can play nuances through it is hard to prove in the market place.  I read alternative B as somewhat less hawkish than our August statem ent, and I would strong ly support Governor Kroszner’s recommendation to strike “on balan ce” because, again, I do  not want to overly encourage the market behavior that we have seen  over the intermeeting period.  So with that I recommend alternative B with the striking of “on balance.” 111 of 132

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Mishkin. 

[SECTION]

MR. MISHKIN.  Well, in contra st to some people here, actuall y I’m quite comfortable with the Greenbook forecast as  to the most lik ely path of inflation.  I am more troubled about what is further out beyond the po licy horizon.  I think that  the most likely path of  inflation is to hit 2½ percent on the CPI and stay there, which is correspondingly around 2 percent on the PCE deflator.  So I do have some discomfort there, but I do not think that purs uing something like B+ or raising rates at this time is the right way to deal  with this problem.  How we manage expectations really is an issue, and we can’t do it with the apparatus we have now.  I am very much looking forward to the discussion of comm unications at the next meeting [laughter] because I think the issue here is our overall stra tegy about monetary polic y.  We have to think about how we put it all together in terms of what we do at a particular meeting and in terms of ho w we manage expectations going forward. So at this particular juncture I am very comf ortable with B.  I thin k that the right way to express the fact that we are uncomfortable with the current rate of inflation and with what will happen more than two years out is  to do it through the minutes.  I am sure the minutes will show that the sentiment of  the Committee is that we ’re not comfortable with ha ving a situation in which, if inflation does not moderate al ong the lines of the Greenbook, we keep rate s the same.  In that context, we would likely have to raise them; or  if the economy weakens somewhat and inflation does not decline th e way we hope it w ill, we might actually have to maintain  rates at the current level longer than the mark et might otherwise expect .  So we can do it that way at this stage, and we’ll just have to see where the Committee comes out in thinking ab out how we manage expectations in the future.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman Geithner. 112 of 132            

[SECTION]

 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I was fairly comf ortable with our decision in August, and I am fairly comfortable with that decision in retr ospect.  Whether we were wise or we have been lucky is something only history will  judge.  I would be more comfor table if there were a slightly positive slope to expectations about the future path  of policy and less certainty  around that path, but I don’t know how to achieve that responsibly with language today.  As Governor Kohn said, despite whatever discomfort one may have with that path  in markets today, we can’t say that path is fundamentally getting in the way of our confidence or the world’s conf idence in our capacity to achieve our objectives.  So I’m comfortable with not moving today and ba sically fine with the language in alternative B. I have just two other observations to make.  It is striking that we have an asymmetry in the growth paragraph and in the inflation paragrap h in that we have s lipped into giving a forward-looking view about the likely path of inflation in a qualitative sense but  have not done so in the growth paragraph for lo ts of reasons.  I think that the asymmetry creates a bit of a problem for us today in trying to explain how we view the outlook and the risks to the outlook.  The absence of any language about the future path of  growth makes me more uncomfor table than I felt about the path today, and so I think we should  come back and think about whether we want to correct that.  Correcting that asymmetry might help a bit in ex plaining to the world an y difference between the staff forecast, which will be clear ly reflected in the minutes, and the implicit fo recast of the Committee. My second point is  just about the minutes.   I think that there is  an issue regarding the minutes in that the staff forecas t gets expressed with a clarity that is not expressed about the Committee forecast. The Co mmittee forecast is necessa rily described more vagu ely:  It’s harder to find what the center of gravity is, and even the tails don’t necessarily come through.  We probably 113 of 132       saw the reaction we did to the minu tes last time because, even wh en the Committee’s  judgment is much different from the staff’s, th at difference is hard to characte rize in the minutes.  That is another topic for future discussion.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you all.  Our pause at the last meeting was a benefit-cost calculation.  The bene fit of pausing was to give ourselv es more time to  assess the state of the economy and the effects of our previous interest rate actions .  The potential cost of pausing was that we would lose some cr edibility, that infla tion might move adversely, and we would get behind the curve in terms of that very important  goal.  The inte rmeeting developmen ts have shown a somewhat weaker economy in real terms than we had expected and, I think I can safely say, no reduction in uncertainty.  Although inflation remains above where we would like  it to be, I think we can’t say that the inflation situation has deteriorat ed during the intermeeting period.  Therefore, it’s reasonable for us to continue to pause to get mo re information and to ev aluate the state of the economy.  We can, of course, main tain our policy stance at this level for a while if we deem it sufficiently restrictive, or we ca n move it as new information comes in .  At this point we will have a very high degree of flex ibility in future actions. I’d like to make a few other comments about so me of the conversation ar ound the table.  I’m bemused by the de facto in flation targeters that we have become here [laughte r] with the 1.5 percent goal.  Let me just make a couple of comments on  that.  First, flexible  inflation targeting does respond to things other than the ta rget itself.  In particular, we sa w a surprising increase in inflation earlier this year, which took us above or further ab ove our implicit target.  The optimal response to that is to return to target, but only slowly and w ith the amount of time to take to get back to the target depending positively on the initial deviation.  Second, the sp eed at which you return to the target ought to depend on the state of the real ec onomy.  The extent to wh ich we’re concerned about 114 of 132        potential recessionary effects shoul d make us be a little more cautious and ma ke us move a little more slowly.  I would add that, although a number of us, including  myself, have mentioned this 1 to 2 percent zone, it has also been noted around this tabl e that it may not, in fact, be the right zone.  If we do determine that we want to announce a target and it is 1.5 percent, we should lay out a plan for getting to that level over a period of time and no t immediately.  But we  might choose as an alternative possibility, for ex ample, 1½ to 2 percent,  in which case we would be somewhat closer to that target in a shorter time. Let me also say a word  about credibility, whic h is a little subtle, and I am probably going to mess it up. I think there ar e two definitions of cred ibility.  The first is the one we are all familiar with, which Paul Volcker gave to the Federal Reserve and for whic h he is one of my personal heroes. That is the kind of credibility that involv es doing what you have to do to get inflation where it needs to be. Let me be completely clear that, if  inflation conditions begi n to deteriorate and our credibility comes under serious threat, I certainly will suppor t doing whatever it is  we have to do to maintain that credibility.  There is another kind of credibility, however, which I think was brought to the Federal Reserve by  Alan Greenspan, which is credibility an d confidence in our ability to analyze and forecast the economy su fficiently well that we can achieve our objectives in a way that does not induce undue harm to th e economy.  I think that  the Greenbook foreca st, if it comes true, would in fact be a quite positive accomplishment for this Comm ittee because it would have us bringing inflation down to a reas onable level in a moderate way and avoiding a recession.  That outcome would actually be very good.  In fact, our task is going to be more difficult than that, as I’ve indicated. Part of our task going forward is not ju st to show that we’re  committed to fighting inflation, which we are, but also  that we are very deftly evalua ting the state of the economy and making good judgme nts about what ne eds to be done. 115 of 132           Let me turn to the statement.  I would like to discuss certain elements of it.  I’d like to propose that we use alternative B, and let me note a few points.  Firs t, I’m sure that everyone noted that in section 2, in the phrase “reflecting a cooling of the housin g market,” we are eliminating the word “gradual” and doing so indicates a somewhat st ronger degree of cooling.   Second, in response to President Poole, I thin k this is not intended to be anything  other than a pure description of the economy and our sense of what is  happening in the economy.  It actually does have a bit of a forward-looking aspect as well, Vice  Chairman Geithner; and it is fact ual in that, if you look at the forecast, the slowdown in construction accounts for almost all the decline from potential.  So I don’t think it’s in any way focu sing our policy decision  on the housing sector. In section 3, the addition of “reduced impetus from energy pric es” is useful, I think.  We have been criticized for,  among other things , being too sanguine about the disinflation and arguing implicitly that a modest  amount of slowing in the economy would be su fficient to achieve disinflation.  We do not actually believe that, and one of the reasons we forecasted a decline in inflation is that we expected to  see a reduced impetus from energy prices going forward.  We now have actually seen the fall in energy prices, and so we don’t even have to ap peal, for example, to the futures market.  We can simply stat e that we have seen this decline in energy prices, and I think that makes our story a little more comp lete and makes it lo ok more understandabl e to the public about why we think that inflation sh ould decline slowly over time. I propose to keep the assessment of risk as it st ands.  It’s very clear that our bias is toward resisting inflation.  I’m not even sure that B+ would actually be a more hawkish phrase because it admits the possibility of easing, whereas th is statement actually suggests that it’s unlikely that our next move will be a nything other than upward.  I am torn abou t the phrase “on balance.”  The intention of the phrase was to note the slightly bett er readings but to emphasize that the overriding 116 of 132                       view is that inflation readings are still elevated.  However, several people have suggested taking it out, and I am willing to do so. Are there others who ha ve a strong view on e way or the other? 

[SECTION]

MR. MOSKOW. I would agree with taking it out.  It’s a go od suggestion because, when you change the language  from the last time, people focus on that, and putting it in will overemphasize the importance of it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I get a se nse of nodding around the ta ble, so let’s strike the words “on balance” from sectio n 3.  “In part” was changed back to “partly” just to be the same as last time.  We consulted with the style editor, an d she assured us that th ere was no substantive difference between those two.  [Laughter]  So my recommendation then is no action today, and alternative B in the statem ent is amended by eliminating the phra se “on balance.”  May I have your reactions?  All right. If there is no further comment, then please call the roll.
