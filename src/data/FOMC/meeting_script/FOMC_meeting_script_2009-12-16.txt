CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We need a motion to close our meeting. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. So moved. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Our m eeting today and tomorrow follows the basic sequence we’ve been having recently, but with an important addition, which is that we have a staff presentation on infl ation dynamics.  We need about two hours for that presentation, I understand, and we’ve thought about it and decided to put it at th e end of the meeting so we would have plenty of time to complete our policy decision.  But I hope that people will pay attention to the time and make sure we have enough time tomorrow to give appropriate attention to the presentation. In that spirit, why don’t we start directly?  Mr. Sack. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK.1  Since the last FOMC meeting, fi nancial conditions have generally become more supportive of economic growth. Yields have declined at short- and intermediate-term maturities, and equity pr ices have posted a solid gain, while the dollar has remained about unchanged on net.  Some of the adjustment in financial ma rkets appears to have been driven by increased confidence among investors that shor t-term interest rates will remain low.  The repetition of the “extended period” la nguage in the November FOMC statement, along with the additional clarity provided by including explicit conditioning factors, seemed to solidify investors’ expecta tions that policy would remain on hold.  Subsequent speeches by FOMC members, in cluding comments that U.S. asset prices do not look obviously out of line with fundame ntals, were seen as providing further support to that view. In response, the exp ected path of monetary policy derived from   futures quotes shifted down as much as 35 basis points over the intermeeting period, as shown in the upper left panel.        5 of 247The Bluebook noted that these futures rate s overstate what investors see as the most likely path for short-term interest rates, because they are influenced by the distribution of risks around th at outcome.  This point can be made by looking at options prices to derive the perceived probabilities of different outcomes for the short-term interest rate, as shown in the di stribution to the right.  According to that exercise, the most likely outcome for the three-month LIBOR rate about ten months from now is that it will remain in the 25 to  50 basis point range.  However, given the proximity of that outcome to the zero bound, the risk is skewed almost completely in the direction of higher rates,  pulling the mean of the dist ribution well above the mode.  As a result, the futures price, which corre sponds to the mean, is about 50 basis points above what is seen as the most likely outcome. With this consideration, there does not appear to be much discrepancy left between market-based measures of policy ex pectations and survey responses, if the latter captures the modal outcome seen by respondents.  Our primary dealer survey indicates that the median respondent expects the first tightening to occur in the fourth quarter of 2010, with a range of views that  spanned from the second quarter of 2010 to early 2012. We also used the survey to query de alers about their interpretation of the “extended period” language used in the FOMC  statement.  By far, the most common response was that the “exte nded period” language would be removed three meetings before an actual rate hike. We are happy to use future versions of the survey to quantify any timing of policy tightening that you want—such as “some time,” “a while,” “before long,” or, maybe to accommodate some Committee members, “immediately.” [Laughter] The lower expected path of  monetary policy contributed to a decline in shorter-term Treasury yields.  This adjustment occurred even though the incoming economic data were generally stronger than anticipate d.  As shown in the middle left panel, the two-year yield fell about 10 basis points, on net, while the 10-year yield posted a small increase.  At one point over the inte rmeeting period, the 2-y ear yield had dipped to 65 basis points—essentially equaling the lowest level on record, as shown in the middle right panel—although it has more r ecently retraced back above 80 basis points. The 10-year yield, at just over 3.5 perc ent, is also low by historical standards, though it is still well above the levels reached at the end of last year.   Yields remain at these low levels despite the fact that inflation concerns seem to be lingering. Some mark et participants continue  to discuss whether the accommodative monetary policy stance and expansionary fiscal policy will eventually lead to upward inflation pressu re.  Consistent with those concerns, the 5-year, 5-year forward break-even inflati on rate remains near the upper end of the range observed in recent years, as shown in the bottom left panel.        6 of 247While we recognize that tec hnical factors can affect br eak-even rates, it seems that perceptions of inflation risk have at least contributed to their recent patterns.  Several observations support that view. First,  flows into mutual funds that invest in inflation-linked products have increased notably over the cour se of 2009, indicating elevated demand for inflation protection among retail investors.  Second, investors in the swaption market are paying an increasi ngly large premium for protection against a rise in longer-term interest rates, which coul d in part reflect con cerns about inflation expectations moving higher.  However, some  of the other patterns associated with inflation jitters, such as risi ng gold prices and a falling dolla r, have reversed course in recent weeks.  We will be watching closely to see if that reversal is a temporary head fake or a more persistent shift in trend.  Looking across global sovereign debt markets,  we find that another factor that has recently come into play is the perceived risk of default.  Given the fiscal challenges facing a wide range of countries, investor s have been reeval uating their views on sovereign default risk. One measure of this  risk, albeit an imperfect one because of the limited size of the market, is the prici ng of CDS on sovereign debt.  As shown to the right, there has been cons iderable upward pressure on th e yields of Greek debt as been expressed about Spain and Ireland, and th e fiscal situations in the U.S. and the U.K. have also been discussed in this context.  However, to date there appears to have been little upward pressure on U.S. yields from this factor. Overall, any upward pressure on Treasury yi elds arising from i nvestors’ concerns about longer-term inflation risks or the fiscal outlook is being dominated by the downward pressure arising from the prospect of low short-term interest rates for an extended period, leaving Treasury yields quite low. Turning to the next exhibit, better economic news and the prospect of accommodative short-term interest rates contributed to a further advance in the prices of some risky assets.  Most  notably, broad equity indexe s posted another sizable gain since the last FOMC meeting, with the S& P 500 index up more than 5 percent on net. One of the issues that I have addressed in recent briefings is  whether risky asset prices have risen too far. To help make  this judgment, we can look to valuation models, such as the Board’s measure of the equity premium.  This premium, shown to the right, still appears wide by historical standards, suggesting that the run-up in equity prices since earlier this year has not pushed them too high relative to fundamentals.  Similarly, an analysis of  corporate bond spreads suggests that their risk premiums are also not unusually narrow. Another approach to address this issue is to look across asset classes in order to see if all risky assets are rising, as such a pattern could imply an indiscriminate increase in risk tolerance on the part of investors.  Correlations in the movements across various asset classes, reported in th e middle left panel, have been unusually high over the past six months, compared w ith their levels a few years ago, with          7 of 247increasing equity prices strongly associat ed with rising emerging market equity prices, rising commodity prices, and declini ng corporate yield spreads.  To be sure, this pattern could result from a variety of factors, such as  the considerable change in the economic outlook and the easing in financi ng strains.  However, some might take this pattern as indicative of a large shift in  risk preferences that, if carried too far, could be associated with speculative excesses. The current intermeeting period provides some relief from this pattern, though.  Even though equity prices charged ahead, they  did not pull all risky asset prices with them.  Indeed, corporate bond spreads, shown to  the right, appear to have leveled out to a considerable degree. Moreover, yi eld spreads on commercial mortgage-backed securities, the bottom left panel, have widened since the summer, and ABS spreads across most other asset classes have also edged higher recently.  Thus, the performance of risky assets has been mi xed.  In addition, even though the events associated with the debt sta ndstill by Dubai World were not a primary driver of these price movements, they provided a reminder to  investors of the need to assess credit risk and differentiate across borrowers. Banks, in particular, continue to be wary of taking additional credit risk onto their balance sheets. They have continued to  tighten the terms on many types of lending, and the volume of bank loans has continued to contract.  These patterns contrast sharply with the narrowing of credit spreads in capital markets since earlier this year and the robust issuance of corporate bonds that has taken place in recent months.  Bank equity prices, shown in the bott om right panel, were mixed over the intermeeting period.  The recent focus of th e market has been on the efforts by Bank of America, Citigroup, and We lls Fargo to repay TARP f unds, as investors weigh the advantages of escaping TARP against the dilutive effects of the capital increases required to do so. The next exhibit addresses the Fed’s larg e-scale asset-purchase programs.  The Desk has been tapering its purchases of MBS and agency debt, as shown in the top two panels. But despite the slower pace, our purchases continue to put pressure on these markets.  The available supply of MBS in the market has been limited, as seasoned bonds seem to be largely locked up in portfolios and new originations have been relatively light. Given these market dynamics, our purchases  have produced a further richening of MBS and agency debt relative to Treasury securities, as can be seen in the yield spreads shown in the middle panels.  Indeed, the concern among ma rket participants that these spreads would widen as the Fed pulled back from its purchase programs has not yet materialized.  Market  participants continue to raise this concern, however, with many expressing a view th at the MBS spread to Treasu ries could quickly rise by 25 to 50 basis points from its current level.   Accordingly, we will continue to watch for such developments as our purchases decline further.      8 of 247Of course, winding down our purchases of  assets is just one dimension of managing our balance sheet.  The evolution of financial market conditions will depend on all  decisions influencing the size a nd composition of the balance sheet going forward. In that regard, the Committee faces a key policy issue, namely, setting the appropriate strategy for eith er redeeming or reinvesti ng maturing SOMA holdings.  Like asset sales, redemptions of SOMA assets allow policymakers to shrink the balance sheet, simultaneously  reducing excess reserves a nd reversing some of the portfolio-balance effects that resulted from the LSAP programs.  This outcome may be seen as desirable, depending on th e evolution of economic and financial conditions. The figure in the bottom left panel shows the profile of remaining maturities for our holdings of Treasury and agency securiti es as well as the pattern of principal payments that we anticipate on our holdings  of MBS.  The MBS profile is based on a prepayment model that incorporates a market -based forecast of interest rates, and it should be noted that there is a considerab le amount of uncertainty surrounding those estimates.  Those MBS payments would come on top of the nearly $50 billion of prepayments that we have already experi enced to date, and which we have not reinvested. The table in the bottom right panel shows the path of th e size of the Fed’s balance sheet under several possible redemption st rategies.  The first row assumes full reinvestment of all SOMA securities, whic h would require the LSAPs to be expanded to replace the MBS prepayments and agency debt maturities already received.  This strategy would leave the size of the portfolio steady at $2.2 trillion through 2011.  The second row assumes that the Desk redeem s all agency securities that mature and all MBS that are prepaid, while following its usual practice of reinvesting Treasury holdings. This strategy allows the balan ce sheet to shrink gra dually, providing about $350 billion of redemptions (rela tive to the full reinvestme nt strategy) by the end of 2011. The third row shows the effects of redeeming all SOMA holdings, including Treasury securities. This strategy reduces  the balance sheet by over $500 billion by the end of 2011. Of course, other strategi es could also be used under which only a portion of the Treasury portfo lio would be reinvested. At this point, the Desk only seeks to verify the Committee’s preference to allow MBS and agency debt to run off the balance sheet without replacement.  As noted, this is the approach that has been taken to date with the prepayment of MBS, and it is the approach that was taken with the agency  debt security that matured on December 10, the first security purchas ed under the LSAP programs to mature.  Going forward, the flow of maturing agency securitie s and prepaid MBS will become more substantial, adding to the importance of deciding upon the redemption strategy. Reaching a decision for handling Treasury se curities is less pressing, as the Desk has a long-standing practice of routinely re investing existing Tr easury holdings and          9 of 247can continue to do so for now. However,  policymakers may want to revisit the redemption strategy for Treasury securities before long, as it gives them more scope to achieve different balance sheet outcomes. Your final exhibit covers the behavior of  short-term interest rates and discusses the market’s views on some of the Fed’s exit tools.  As shown in the upper left panel, the Fed’s balance sheet expanded modestly since the last FOMC meeting, reflecting further increases in our asset holdings accumulated under the LSAP programs.  The balance sheet currently stands at $2.2 trillion, with $1.8 trillion of that corresponding to our holdings of Treasury, agency , and mortgage-backed securities. Partly as a result of the growth of the ba lance sheet, the amount of excess reserves in the banking system has also increased a nd currently stands at about $1.1 trillion, as shown to the right. With that large amount  of liquidity in the system, the federal funds rate has remained persistently below th e interest rate paid on excess reserves, or the IOER rate. It is useful to look at this relationshi p between excess reserves and the federal funds rate as a scatter plot, shown in the middle left panel for the period since last although it is very small in magnitude.  When excess reserve balances were around $600 billion, the spread between the federal f unds rate and the IOER rate tended to be limited.  As reserves have increased to wards and now beyond $1 trillion, the spread has grown to a typical level of 10 to 15 ba sis points.  Of course, a key area of uncertainty that policymakers face is the exte nt to which this relationship will shift as the IOER rate increases. Given the large amounts of reserves and the behavior of short-term interest rates, various policy actions, such as draining reserves, increasing the IOER rate, and selling assets. We asked a number of questi ons in our dealer survey to gauge their own views on these issues. The survey results indicate that about three-quarters of the respondents expected the Fed to use temporary reserve-draining tool s, either reverse repos or term deposits, before any increases in the policy rate. The remainder expected reserve draining and policy rate increases to begin at the sa me time, and no respondents expected the policy rate to be raised before any dr aining operations took place.  Based on the median of all responses, th e initial use of reverse repos and term deposits was expected to take place in the third quarter of 2010, while  the first policy tightening was expected to take place in the fourth  quarter, as noted ea rlier in the briefing. Some additional information on the expected  path of these tools is presented in the lower left panel. As can be seen, reverse repos and term deposits are both expected to ramp up through the second quart er of 2011 and to edge up further into        10 of 2472012. By the middle of 2012, the responde nts expected about $300 billion of outstanding reverse repurchase agreements and $200 billion of term deposits.  About half of the respondents also expected asse t sales to be used, bringing the average expected path of sales above zero. Howe ver, as can be seen, asset sales were expected to be increased mo re slowly.  Lastly, about half of the respondents also expected SFP balances to be raised from  their current level and hence to remove reserves.  Based on the use of all of these tools, respondents on average expected the FOMC to drain several hundred billi on dollars of reserves before  the first policy tightening, leaving the amount of excess reserves at th at time below $1 trillion.  However, as shown by the distribution in th e bottom right panel, there is a fairly wide range of views on that outcome.  Respondents also e xpected the FOMC to continue draining reserves even after an incr ease in the policy rate, but th eir responses suggest that a 2012. Let me close with a brief note about year -end effects, which are not covered in your charts. We continue to monito r year-end pressures and the potential consequences for markets.  As I discussed in my last briefing, we are not seeing any upward pressure on unsecured lending across year-end, the traditi onal year-end effect in markets, presumably as a result of th e substantial amount of liquidity in the risk-free assets spanning year-end, which has put significant downward pressure on short-term Treasury yields.  For example, the implied forward rate from Treasury bills for the week spanning year-end has been consistently negative for several months, and last week’s auction of the four-week bills stopped out at a rate of precisely 0. However, the downward pre ssure on rates does not appear to be intensifying or causing significant market  disruption, and thus does not clearly necessitate a policy response. One development that could alleviate some of the market pressure is issuance of SFP bills ahead of year-end.  If the debt ceiling is increased soon by a sizable amount, the Treasury will likely auction SFP bills in th e last week of the year.  Those auctions would be part of a broader plan to retu rn SFP balances to $200 billion.  However, given the politics surroundi ng the debt limit decision, this outcome is, at best, uncertain at this point. Thank you.  Th at concludes my prepared comments. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Brian, you’re  right that we need to be thinking as a Committee about the sequencing of how we will remove the pol icy accommodation.  My thought on this had been that we needed to wait un til we had a somewhat clearer idea of what the timing of the availability of the tools was going to be.  I’m asking Brian Sack and Brian   11 of 247Madigan, whom I have not warned about this question—do you think that January might be a time when we could at least begin a discussion on this at the Committee level?  Will we have enough information about our tools? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Yes, I think we’ll have enough info rmation.  There will certainly be details about the tools that we’re sti ll working out, but I think we’ll have some information on their scope. For reverse repos, in particular, we essen tially already have the capacity to do the amount of reserve draining that was indi cated in the survey.  So I w ouldn’t argue for putting off that more strategic debate in order to hammer out ever y last detail of the tools.  I think it’s probably time to move forward with that. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. So no late r than January we will put this on the agenda for discussion. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. I think it is important to do th at in January.  But I would just like to emphasize that, in the context of that and thinking about sequencing, I think it would also be very helpful to think about what we believe the steady-state policy tools ar e going to be; that is, how are we going to conduct policy in normal tim es going forward with in terest on reserves?  And, I think it is important to ha ve that discussion, but in the context of thinking about how we use the tools, and the way we use these tools, in teracts with where we ultimately want to end up in how we conduct policy—whether it is a floor sy stem or a corridor system—and what we think is going to happen to the funds market.  I think th ese things are tied toge ther, and I’d like to see that discussion carried on in tandem if we can.    12 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The point is well ta ken.  I guess I would say that, given all of these important decisions, ma ybe we should all try to minimi ze excessive speculation in public about this subject until we as a Committee have come to more clarity on sequencing.  But these are issues we need to address very soon. So thank you for that. On the issue of reinvestment, let me just add this one other option I can think of, which is to reinvest in bills. This gives you maximu m flexibility if you want to drain quickly. Are you looking for some kind of Committee gui dance at this point, or are you going to come back to us? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. I would just like to make sure that everyone is on board with running down the agency and MBS holdings, or at least doing that as an  interim strategy.  In  terms of a strategy for the entire portfolio or a strategy to be used  beyond the near term, I think that, yes, we should come back and have a full discussion and one that  probably to some degree folds in the issue of asset sales, because obviously redemptions acc omplish many of the things that asset sales accomplish. One way to think about the redemption strategy is that it is in some sense a commitment strategy to convince the markets that you are not going to shed your portfolio too quickly.  So one question I think we should consider is:  If there are other ways to make that commitment, then do asset sales give us more flexibility? Obviously what is somewhat odd about redemptions is the flip side of that, which is that this de cision about how quickly to shrink the portfolio is governed by other factors that are uncertain and that could change  and so on.  So I would like to give it full consideration, along with the disc ussion of whether there is any strategy through which we could sell assets  safely in some regard.      13 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, again, use of bills could smooth out the path if you thought the redemptions were too quick, for example. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Absolutely. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. If anyone has concer ns about letting things mature as an interim strategy, you should menti on that in our discussion. Before I open the floor for questions for Bria n, the Vice Chairman had an introduction he would like to make. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I wanted to in troduce Steve Friedman from the Markets Group in New York. Steve runs the forex area.  So he’s partners in crime with Mr. Sheets on swaps and other things. Welcome, Steve. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Welcome.  Okay. Questions or comments for Brian? Governor Tarullo. 

[SECTION]

MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, on panel 29, the orange line for asset sales—that is understood by dealers to be  sales and not just the runoff through maturation of these securities? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. That’s correct, t hough I think one shortcoming of the survey as we designed it is that we didn’t actually ask about redemptions, so I think we will do that in the future.  But this question was phrased to be explicitly a bout sales.  A few dealers volunteered views on redemptions under the category of “other,” but I th ink in the future we’ll be more careful about trying to get their views on their exp ectations about the redemption strategy. 

[SECTION]

MR. TARULLO. All right. I th ink you just answered my next question, which is:  At this juncture you’re not certain as to what the dealer views ar e on what our redemption default position is?  14 of 247MR. SACK. I would strongly gue ss that the consensus expecta tion is that the agency and MBS will be run off and the Treasuries will be re invested, but I’ll have more confidence in that if we measure it in the next survey. 

[SECTION]

MR. TARULLO. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Rosengren. MR. ROSENGREN. Just a question on panel 28. Is the policy rate that they’re talking about there the fed funds rate or  the interest rate on reserves? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. It’s the federal f unds rate.  I think it’s likely th at market participants see those two, the federal funds rate  target and the IOER  rate, moving in tandem.  But again, we didn’t explicitly get that from the survey—the su rvey asks about timing of policy tightening in terms of an increase in the federal funds rate target. 

[SECTION]

MR. ROSENGREN. So no dealer raised the question of whether you would just move the interest rate on reserves but not do anything else, for example? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. They did not. But again, I think we  could incorporate that in future surveys.  I also think that, if we’re very interested in gauging the market’s view s on all of these issues— obviously there may be a few survey issues to clean up—we also might want to consider doing a broader survey. This is a surv ey of the 18 primary dealers.  It’s answered mainly by the economists at those primary dealers.  We’re not c onvinced that they have the same views as the traders or as a broader set of fi nancial firms.  So if there is a lot of interest in gauging these expectations, I think we could make a more extensive effort for the next meeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Governor Kohn.     15 of 247MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wonder ed, Brian, if you coul d talk a little bit about the CMBS market and the TALF, and part icularly new CMBS.  I guess the issuance has been limited under the TALF.  Why is that, and what are the prospects? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. As you know, the November TA LF subscription included the first new-issue CMBS deal, the DDR deal.  That seemed to have some positive effect on the market, even though we ended up taking only a small amount of risk, I think, on the portfolio—the amount of the loan was only $72 million.  The deal was very well received and seemed  to initiate some activity in the market.  Since then we’ve seen  two other new single-bor rower issues come to 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Through TALF? MR. SACK. No, not through TALF , outside of TALF.  And we hear reports of a handful of other issues also being prepared to come to market.  Of cour se, this is still a trickle of issuance compared with where we were several years ago, so I think the market is still extremely impaired, but showing some signs of life. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Are there signs that mo re are going to bring it to TALF? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. I think TALF has been a very impor tant factor in bringi ng this activity back and will continue to be for as long as it’s in place.  But, at the same time, I think there has been a surprise at how strong the demand has been fo r the issues.  So maybe that’s the most encouraging sign—not only did TALF get a deal done , but it brought some activity back to the 

[SECTION]

MR. NELSON. I’d add just a few things. The two deals that were priced had been in the TALF pipeline, so they were thinking of ma king them TALF-eligible, and they decided, having observed the reaction to the first deal, it was possible to go ahead w ithout that.  The other thing is  16 of 247that half of the loans th at were taken out for DDR have actuall y been repaid already, that is, half of the $72 million. Finally, yesterday was the December CMBS subscription, and there were no new-issue CMBS brought to that subscription. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Let me add a few more things.  We have begun to ask market participants about their expectations for the market, to tr y to assess how dependent it is on TALF.  We’ve asked a very small set of market participants, so ta ke all of these responses with a grain of salt.  The general view was that CMBS  spreads would widen once the TALF expired, and, indeed, in secondary market trading we do see some difference between similar deals that are TALF-eligible and not TALF-eligible. So it does a ppear, based on that eviden ce, that the TALF is having an effect on keeping spr eads narrower than otherwise. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Evans. MR. EVANS. Thank you. Brian, actually you began to answer my question on the primary dealers.  I rea lize, after listening to and seeing pres entations like this, I didn’t really know who the survey respondents were.  Is it rea lly bank economists?  I thought this was more financial market participants.  I guess the question is:  If it is bank economists, is it really that different from, say, the Blue Chip  or NABE or something like that? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. It’s very hard to gauge.  We know the survey is filled out by a lot of economists, but they sit on trading desks and talk to traders.  So it’s somewhat mixed, I would say, in terms of what you are actually getting. 

[SECTION]

MR. EVANS. Do you have any idea if it’s consistent from time to time, or do they mix it up? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. My impression is that it’s c onsistent.  At the New York Fed, we also interact with a separate group of advisers , who are from the buy side, and we’ve been    17 of 247experimenting with running a similar survey out to that group where we clearly would be reaching investment managers.  As we move in to 2010, we hope to bring that product on line as a MarketSOURCE piece for exactly this purpose, that is, to broaden our reach in these surveys.  I think the surveys are proving very valuable in being able to address key policy issues, so I think we want to maximize their effectiveness. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Vice Chairman. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. As  one of those people who used to receive those surveys, I know that they usually go to the econ omists who sit on the des k.  If they’re uncertain about how to answer the question, th ey’ll talk to the traders.  So I think there’s probably a little gap between the economists’ view s and the traders’ views, but  generally the traders are consulted. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lockhart. MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, a couple of questions that are triggered by the slides, but you may want to wait until next month to answer them.  Looking at slide 23, if we wanted to shift this maturity sc hedule, could we trade within the portfolio to adjust the way that maturity schedule looks? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Yes, you certainly could. Eve n, say, within a certain asset class, like Treasuries, you have options such as those that came up earlier, like redeeming longer-term securities and reinves ting shorter-term ones, or even rein vesting longer-term ones into shorter-term securities.  There are some limits on doing that at auction, but you c ould always do that in the secondary market as well.  The same is tr ue for MBS.  There’s nothing in theory that prevents us from selling MBS and purchasing Trea suries or trying to reallocate across asset classes. I think there would be obvious ch allenges to doing any of  that in terms of   18 of 247communicating to the markets what you’re doing, a nd we’d have to be very careful in that communication, but it could be done. I’ll also say that there’s a lo t of concern in the markets about sales of MBS.  We’ve bought a lot, and we’ve been the do minant player in the market.  The market is concerned about adjusting to our not being there as  a steady purchaser, and I think the idea of our being there as a net seller of MBS is a concern to some.  So while all of these stra tegies are possible, I think we’d have to be very careful about what we were trying to achieve and make sure the market understood it. 

[SECTION]

MR. LOCKHART. A second question, if I may. According to slide 30, if I understand it correctly, a great majority of re spondents believe that we woul d start tightening the fed funds rate target while we have rela tively high levels of excess reserves.  How are they thinking and how are you thinking about how the fed funds ra te market works in the condition of high reserves? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Again, we didn’t get into that leve l of detail.  I think the presumption would be that they understand that inte rest on excess reserves is a tool  that can raise all short-term interest rates even with a larg e amount of reserves in the syst em.  In this response, they’re implicitly saying that that mechanism will work, or  at least that policymakers think it will work with a relatively high degree of re serves, or at least that policym akers will begin to tighten and see if it works. 

[SECTION]

MR. LOCKHART. So if we rais e the interest rate on excess reserves, the fed funds rate will follow to an extent. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Right. I think that’s the genera l perception, although as I noted in the text, there’s a lot of uncertainty. If you look at panel 27, we know th at with all of these excess 19 of 247reserves, the funds rate has been soft to the IOER rate.  I think a real key policy question is:  Is that spread steady?  If that spread is steady—10 to 15 basis points—then it seems that policymakers have very effective control of shor t-term interest rates ev en with the amount of reserves indicated in the lower right panel.  Th ere’s just no way to measure empirically whether that spread will be steady because we’ve only had this period of high reserves when we’ve been pinned up against the zero bound. So th at is, I think, a key policy question. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher. MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just  a quick question on slide No. 29.  What do you guess that slide would have l ooked like before we began tes ting reverse repos as an exit strategy? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. I think your question raises a general issue about the fact that we’re doing a survey with the firms we have been interacting with the most in terms of setting up the reverse repo program. There was some concern on our end about whether that was biasing the results in this direction.  So, I think th at argues for the wider survey. Having said all of that, when we speak to market participants out side of the primary dealers, there’s just an incred ible amount of focus on reverse re pos, and I am not sure why that is, relative to term deposits.  So I think, broadl y speaking, market participants really do expect reverse repurchase agreements to be a key part of the policy tools.  Of course, in this response both reverse repos and term deposits are being used  very actively.  Revers e repos are a little bit higher, but they’re both very active draining tools.  It may be that asking the dealers puts a little bit more focus on reverse repos, but I’m not sure.  I wouldn’t want to say that this probably does not represent the broader review. I think that, if we could make an  effort to find that out through a broader set of participants, then I wouldn’ t be surprised if it comes out similarly.  20 of 247MR. FISHER. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser. MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First,  just a follow-up on th at last point.  I think the dealers are focusing on reverse repos because  that’s what they hear us talk about most of the time.  We haven’t talked as much publicly  about the term deposits or asset sales.  So I think we sort of get back from them what we say at times, and we have to  be a little bit careful interpreting that, just  as an observation. On redemptions and so forth, I tend to think we are going to have to shrink our balance sheet, and I think your memo very effectively focuses our thinking about the optimal size of our balance sheet and how we want to think about that .  We have walked up to this question over and over again over the last year and a half and really haven’t come to  grips with what the answer is, but this sort of raises that ques tion foursquare, and I thi nk it’s important that we think about that.  I think the direction going forward is that the ba lance sheet is going to get smaller rather than larger, so I’m in favor of letting them all run o ff.  In terms of Treasur ies, I do think at some point, as the Chairman’s comment  suggested, if we get back to  a SOMA portfolio that looks more like it used to look, we’re going to have to  start substituting short- term for long-term.  I don’t know that we need to do that initially, but certainly that w ould be a possibility. Back to the sequencing—again, I think these things interact w ith one another.  We have two other things affecting the overall balance sheet.  One is the r unoff in the liquidity programs.  Another issue, which we haven’t returned to, is the SFP.  What’s  going to happen to it?  Is it going to come back?  How is that going to effect our balance sheet? And how would that interact with all of this?  So I think there’s a whole comp lex set of interactions that we need to be thinking about. That’s why I commented earlier about the need to discuss our views on how we 21 of 247implement policy going forward, sort of a new stea dy state.  How we get to that steady state is combination of these things.  I don’t think we can think about th em in isolation. So, if you have got some observations about  the SFP, I’d love to hear them, too. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. First, let me respond to your point on communications about reverse repos versus other tools, such as asset sales or the term deposit facility.  I think in part that has been a result of the timing.  The reverse repo tool for the Treasury and agency co llateral, at least, has progressed more quickly, and we wanted to go ahead and test it.  So you do have a situation where we’ve had more communications about that.  I think we’ll see—and Jim Clouse will talk about this—more communication on  the term deposit facility goi ng forward, and so some catch­up in that regard. On the SFP, I thought the survey results were interesting.  Roughly speaking, half of the respondents thought it would just  stay at $15 billion, and the ot her half thought it would be ramped back up to $200 billion.  Our thinking was th at, with an adequate increase in the debt limit, which as of yesterday we thought we were probably going to get, SFP would run back up to $200 billion over a relatively quick time frame— four to six weeks—and to a point where we had a nice, evenly spaced maturity distribution that would then just roll over and keep that size.  More recently, it looks like the debt limit may be raised by a much more limited amount, only enough to provide room for several months, in wh ich case it would be very hard to run up the SFP because it would immediately have to be ru n back down.  But I think that, absent that constraint, our inclination is to have Treas ury run the SFP back up, and that obviously would keep it as a policy tool that coul d be used if needed at some point in the future.  There’s no reason $200 billion is the right number, but I thin k that decision would have to be made in    22 of 247conjunction with our assessment of the effectiv eness of the other tools in terms of getting reserves out. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. But I think that’s why this is important.  The SFP got run down on us, which was implicitly an increase in our balance sheet, and in excess rese rves that we did not necessarily elect to have happen. The discussi on earlier on this was th at it was going to come back up again. What I hear is that it may not  go back up, which, in my view, would strengthen the case for letting some of these other things mature and run off, as opposed to reinvesting them, because excess reserves are already higher th an we thought they would be in the initial go-around of asset purchases. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. A lot depends on wher e you think our policy is working.  If it’s working on the asset side a nd the amount of MBS we buy is what really matters, then the amount of excess reserves is just kind of a residual, and it’s not doing much independently. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Fair enough. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. But there are a numbe r of different ways to think about it. President Hoenig. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, this question is more for you.  Your comment at the outset and then President Plosser’ s reaction to it was describing a discussion that would take place in January.  I’m not clear on how you are outlining the policy discussion that might take place in January versus perhaps now, and if you could clarify that for me, that would be helpful. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Sure. I was just responding to the comment myself, but there are two separate questions.  One question is how accommodative policy should be, and that has to do with the outlook for the economy and in flation and so on.  But there are also what you   23 of 247might call the technical questions, and, in pa rticular, given that we want to unwind accommodation, what would be the appropriate sequenc ing in terms of the tools that we use.  Should we, for example, drain reserves first and th en raise the interest ra te on reserves?  If we drain reserves first, which particular tools shou ld we use and in what combination?  President Plosser pointed out that that’s al so linked to the question of what our official target is.  We may simply want to announce that we are raising th e interest rate on excess reserves and make no comment whatsoever about the federal funds rate, because the control of the federal funds rate now. So again, I want to separate the question of when and how quickly we should be removing accommodation from a more technical se t of questions about whether there is a preferred sequencing or combination that is in  some sense independent of the policy decision itself. There may not be.  It coul d be that those two things are so intertwined that we just have to 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. I agree. I would assume that  we could at this meeting hint about our preferences as we look forward to January, becau se of the very developments that are taking place now in the economy, and not just wait until January for their discussion. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to prohibit discussion, but what I was saying is that, to the extent that th ere is a technical questi on, it would be useful to have some staff input and a chan ce to think about it in advance. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Absolutely. I agree with that. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker. MR. LACKER. I’ll pass. Honest. [Laughter]    24 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you. I think this follo ws up on the point about the meeting that we’ll have in January to discuss tools and se quencing.  Brian, on your chart 27, my staff had conducted a similar analysis.  They used th e dates from December 2008 through current period and found that there is a closer correlation between the effective fed funds rate and interest on reserves when excess reserves are under $800 billion.  It is not as clear on your chart as it was on the chart that my staff prepared.  Is this a useful  analysis as we start to  think about the tools and sequencing?  When excess reserves are closer to  $800 billion, will the inte rest on reserves then be a more effective tool? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. That sounds right.  I actually took this chart from some work being done by Jamie McAndrews and other staff at the New York Fed.  And I know there is similar work going on at the Board and probably a number of other pl aces.  That work tried to fit a demand schedule through here, and it’s a nonlinea r demand schedule.  As you suggest, it has more elasticity at lower levels of reserves and then flattens out. That work has a lot of ot her interesting results, including looking at whether GSE ba lances have a special effect re lative to the overall level of reserves.  So I would expect, hopefully, that some of that work will be presented in whatever material is prepared for the next meeting. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Kocherlakota. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thank you, Mr. Chai rman.  Brian, what is the Desk’s position, if any, on the effect of th e term deposit facility and revers e repos on short-term interest rates? Suppose we start running a term deposit faci lity.  What kind of effect do you foresee that having on the level of short-term in terest rates?  Or is it just goi ng to be totally disconnected, or do you think there is going to be some pass-through or what?     25 of 247MR. SACK. I think one thing it clearly does is pull reserv es out of the market—less reserves available for overnight lending means you’ll bri ng short-term interest  rates up.  That’s exactly what’s shown in exhibit 27, that is, the idea that those t ools could be used to get to a lower level of reserve balances and bring these other short-term interest rates up closer to and One question we wrestled with, especially with reverses, is whether there’s an independent effect, a direct effect, on RP rates.  If we drain $300 billion of reserves by dumping a bunch of collateral into  the RP market, do we not only get the effect in exhibit 27, but do we also get further upward pressure on the RP rate from that collateral?  I think we see that as a possibility—that is, you c ould actually get some further upward  pressure on RP rates relative to overnight rates. I think that would tend to be tr ansitory, but certainly if that collateral were dumped quickly that could happen.  But generall y speaking, and over longer periods of time, we think the main effect comes via affecting the amount of liquidity ava ilable in the overnight lending market, in which case draining enough liquid ity tends to pull rate s up towards the IOER rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. So you’re not worried  about these programs basically being an influence on short-term interest rates beyond the IOER rate.  That’s what I would be concerned about. You’re just saying we are moving the fed funds rate closer to the IOER rate.  That’s fine with me.  I’m more worried that they’re going to be a separate influence on short-term interest rates beyond the IOER rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Well, I think at some point, if the size  is large enough, then, yes, you could pull short-term interest rates above the IOER ra te.  I’m making an assumption that the size of these programs will be calibrated to some objectiv e, whether that objective is getting the other    26 of 247rates around the IOER rate or no t.  So the size will be endoge nous to the framework that the FOMC lays out. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Well, the descriptio n of the TDF involved an auction, so sometimes it can be hard to know exactly what price you’ll get out of that, I would guess. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. That’s right. There’s going to be analysis and judgme nt, but, of course, in the old days when we did temporary operations  every day, there was always assessment and judgment about how much operations were needed. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We will be hearing about the TDF in just a moment.  President Bullard. 

[SECTION]

MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I just wanted to make sure I understand exhibits 19 and 20 and the effects of tapering.  We’re tapering now, and we’ve gotten some distance along that path. I guess these charts  right below are meant to say that the effects have been minor, or there haven’t been any eff ects, even though people in the market said, “Oh, you’re going to back up these rate s.”  Is that a fair assessment? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Yes, exactly. MR. BULLARD. Okay. But, nevertheless, they think if we keep going, then you’re going to get a big effect at some point in the future? 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. That’s right. MR. BULLARD. Okay. So they’re sticking to their story.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. They’re stic king to their story. 

[SECTION]

MR. BULLARD. And we’re going to watch it , because we’re going to be tapering for another 90 days or so.      27 of 247MR. SACK. That’s right. Our purchases have declined, but conditions in the market have been very tight. It’s not just that the a ssets didn’t cheapen, but they have actually richened in terms of the spread narrowing further.  So we haven’t seen any signs of what we and the Now, there are a lot of things going on in ma rkets.  There’s not a lot of supply coming into the market.  We are approaching year-end, and so on.  So we’ll wait and see. But so far, there are no signs that there is any in crease in rates from our pulling back. 

[SECTION]

MR. BULLARD. Okay. So I have just one  question on the survey.  You say, “selling assets.” Well, what do you mean “selling assets?”  If you say you’re going to dump $1 trillion worth of MBS onto the market, yes, that’s going to have a big effect.  But if you sell it in some measured way that makes sense, then it seems lik e these are the right pictures to be thinking about—a first pass at how that would happen. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Yes. In my view, a big chunk of  the question about asset sales is:  Can we do them in a way that doesn’t cause a sharp backup  in rates, whether that’s a pre-commitment to a gradual sales pace, or whether it’s building in  some kind of state responsiveness to interest rates, or whether it’s other appr oaches?  The staff is trying to think about these issues—that is, what mechanisms could we use to sell assets sa fely?  It may be that there is no way to do it convincingly, and the only way to shed assets is  to do it through redemptions, and that would be fine. But I think we at least wa nt to think through all of the op tions and assess whether there is some approach where we could basically get the effects—the same kind of gradual winding down in the portfolio you would get under redemptions—but that woul d give us more flexibility along the way. 

[SECTION]

MR. BULLARD. Thank you.    28 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other que stions?  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. I changed my mind.  [Laught er]  The day we announce that we’re going to sell assets, there’s no doubt that prices ar e going to change.  So I don’t think “no price change” should be the standard of safety, right?  We want to minimize the volatility of the path that prices take to where they’re going af ter the shift of our po licy, represented by the announcement of a path of asset sales.  Is that right?  I mean, you’re using the word “safely.”  I’m sort of inquiring about your mean ing of the word “safely” here. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Okay. What I meant, but you can correct me, was not producing a large backup in rates. I guess I was working under the a ssumption that an abrupt and sizable increase in long-term interest rates would be view ed as counterproductiv e at this point. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. But is it obvious that a ny backup in rates on MBS would be counterproductive? There’s some threshold we  might want to achieve—right?—because the data all suggest that we’re pushing them artificially low. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. The data suggest we’ve pushed th em low.  We do think the LSAPs have worked, and it is just an optimal policy decision about how quickly you want to unwind any of those effects. We can put this differently:  A ch allenge with asset sales pe rhaps is that there will be a tendency for the markets to front-load all of the effects.  When we did LSAPs, you saw an immediate and sizable market reaction; then a lot of the program wa s carrying through the commitment to justify that react ion.  I think policymakers need to  be concerned about those same patterns taking place in reverse. So that’s the issue:  Is there a way to unwind the portfolio slowly to limit that immediate reaction? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. One would think th at clarity about what you’re going to do—speed or price or whatever—would help.  29 of 247MR. LACKER. Yes. Absolutely. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Rosengren. MR. ROSENGREN. Just to follow up on that  point, it seems like you have a huge inventory, and the market doesn’t know how you are going to dispose of it.  Asking the street about what the interest rate reaction would be—i f at every meeting we might potentially dump a whole lot of it, I would want a huge risk premium before I bought that asset.  So, as we think about asset sales, and different rules for handling th em, it seems that if there’s a clear rule, it may have a different effect on the ri sk premium than the possibility that every six weeks you may or so I don’t know how you can measure it empirically. But to the extent that the dealer community has any feel for this, it may be worth getting some sense about inte rest rates as well as quantities when you do your survey. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Okay. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. One quick question, Mr. Chai rman.  You may have alluded to this, but are we going to take an action on whethe r or not we want to do the redemptions? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. My understanding wa s that tentatively, for the moment, we were just going to let things run off. But we were  just introducing this as an issue we need to be aware of. 

[SECTION]

MR. SACK. Correct. I think that strategy is consistent with the cu rrent directive, so I don’t believe any action is necessary. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Vice Chairman.      30 of 247VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I ju st want to add that the issue on redemptions, though, is also colored by what you want the portfolio to look like in the longer run.  Let’s say we start with a portfolio that was bills, notes, and bonds, and was roughly in proportion to the market; but it’s not clear that that’s necessarily the portfolio that we want in the ne w world as we transition to a new monetary policy setting.  That decision on redemptions is partly about balance sheet size, and it’s also partly about  where we want to take the portfolio over the medium to longer run. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Great. Okay?  If th ere are no other questions, let me turn to Jim Clouse and Bill Nelson for a brief report on some facilities.  Jim.  

[SECTION]

MR. CLOUSE. Following up on the plans disc ussed at the last meeting, the Desk carried out a series of sm all-scale, real-value reve rse RP operations over the intermeeting period to identify any oper ational difficulties in moving cash and collateral between the Federal Reserve, the clearing banks, and the primary dealers.  Before conducting the operations, the New York Fed released a statement announcing that a series of such operations would be  conducted and emphasizing that they had no implications for the stance of  monetary policy.  Five such operations have been conducted with both Treasury and agency debt  securities serving as  collateral.  The maturities for these operations ranged from overnight to eight days, including some with overlapping terms.  The operations we re quite small—the maximum outstanding over the last two weeks was only about $400 million—and, as anticipated, had little or no market impact.  All of the opera tions were conducted, settled, and matured successfully.  A few minor technical issues surfaced and are being addressed.  In short, the tests confirmed that the System  now has the capacity to conduct triparty reverse RP operations effectively with pr imary dealers using Treasury and agency debt as collateral. The staff continues to work on extendi ng the reverse RP program to include agency MBS as collateral and to incl ude a broader set of counterparties. Regarding the extension of collateral to include agen cy MBS, the staff has been working with the two triparty clearing banks and the agen cy MBS custodian to determine the most efficient, cost-effective means of reversi ng out agency MBS colla teral.  Significant complications must be addressed in this effort, but the team expects to reach agreement on an overall approach in the near future and to give the clearing banks the go-ahead to make the necessary system cha nges within the next month.  We expect that those changes will be implemented by the end of the first quarter of next year and that small-scale, real-value test revers e RP operations with agency MBS can begin shortly thereafter.       31 of 247In terms of expanding the range of c ounterparties for reve rse RP operations beyond the primary dealers, the Desk has iden tified a set of large cash providers and has begun discussions with some of these fi rms on a number of operational issues.  In addition, the staff is working to develop a set of public criteria that will allow a small number of large firms, perhaps two doze n, to present themse lves as potential counterparties. Both of these efforts are proving quite challe nging given the wide range of institutions involved. The staff is  pursuing this agenda aggressively, but our best guess at this point is that the expansi on of the range of count erparties will require several months for completion. Turning to other work on reserve manage ment tools, the staff has developed a proposal for a term deposit facility, the basic elements of which were summarized in a memo distributed last week.  As envisione d in the proposal, term deposits would be a new type of account offered by the Federal Re serve to any institution that is eligible to earn interest on balances at a Reserve Bank.  Balances  placed in term deposits would not be eligible to satisfy reserve or  clearing balance requi rements or to cover daylight or overnight overdrafts. As a resu lt, balances placed in term deposits would drain reserves. The proposal suggests th at term deposits would be fixed-rate obligations and could have maturities ranging between one and six months with no early withdrawal option. As required by stat ute, the rate paid on term deposits could not exceed the general level of short-term interest rates.  Consistent with the Federal Reserve’s general policy of accepting as coll ateral any sound asset that a bank may hold, the proposal suggests that term deposits could be pledged as collateral to secure borrowing at the discount window or daylight credit. The staff proposal notes that term depos its could be offered to the public in several ways but focuses largely on the po ssibility of auctioning term deposits.  Auctions of term deposits would employ a single-price format so that all winning bidders receive the highest rate among all winning bids at the auction.  Auctions would be conducted at regular intervals, pe rhaps every two weeks,  and the settlement dates and maturities of the deposits could be aligned with the beginning of reserve maintenance periods.  The proposal suggests that the Board would select one Reserve Bank to act as the term deposit offering ad ministrator for the System.  The offering administrator would be responsible fo r tasks such as announcing term deposit auctions and posting auction re sults to a public website. The staff proposal would seek public comm ent on three basic questions:  the need for limitations on the amount of term deposits that any individual institution may hold or win at auction; the appr opriate range of maturities for term deposits; and whether there are any alternative structures for term deposits that should be considered.  After review by the Board, the staff proposal woul d be published in the Federal Register with a 30-day public comment period. Based on the comments received, a final proposal would be published early next year .  As noted previously, the automated systems necessary to implement a term deposit program have been developed and tested, but a number of oper ational steps must be completed before the program can         32 of 247be implemented.  The staff will be working aggressively to complete these steps over the next few months.  Bill will now continue the staff presentation. 

[SECTION]

MR. NELSON. Thank you, Jim.  I will briefly update the Committee on the modifications to the terms on the Term Auc tion Facility and primary credit programs that the staff anticipat es it will propose over the next several months. The TAF auction that was conducted yesterday was again substantially undersubscribed. When it settles on Thur sday, TAF credit will equal $76 billion, 45 percent lower than at the time of th e November FOMC meeting.  All currently outstanding TAF loans will come due coincide nt with the January TAF auction.  At that point, only 28-day TAF credit will be provided.  Although only $75 billion will be auctioned in January, it seems likely that  it will again be undersubscribed because of the steep downward trend in TAF credit and because the year-end will have passed. In light of the continued improvement in  interbank f unding markets, as discussed at the November FOMC meeting, the sta ff expects that it will soon recommend the Board announce a schedule of TAF auction am ounts that decline to zero.  The staff will propose a specific schedule after observing the results of the January 11 auction.  If the auction is again subs tantially undersubscribed, th e staff could propose amounts that decline to zero in just a few months, but eviden ce of stronger demand could lead us to recommend an auction schedule that decl ines a bit more slowly, say, to zero by midyear. Turning to primary credit, primary credit declined 14 percent over the intermeeting period to $19 b illion.  Of that amount, $14 billion is outstanding to Depfa, and $4 billion to Dexia, which are both branches of European banks. On November 17, the Board announced that the maximum maturity on primary credit loans would be reduced  to 28 days on January 14, a first step in normalizing the terms on primary credit.  That change will align the maximum term on primary credit loans with the terms of TAF loans.  A next  step in normalization could be a 25 basis point increase in the primary credit rate.  The discount rate adjustment could be discussed by Board members and Reserve Bank Presidents at the January FOMC meeting, with any increase announced a few days later, presumably accompanied by language that made it clear that the move was not a signal about the outlook for the stance of monetary policy.  The staff envi sions that Presidents might initiate discussions with their boards  of directors about a potenti al increase a week or so before the January FOMC meeting. A further step in normalization of primary credit terms could be a reduction in the maximum maturity to overnight, except for the smallest institutions.  The Board and Reserve Banks could evaluate early next year the advisability and potential timing of such a move.   33 of 247Consideration about further increases in  the primary credit–federal funds rate spread could be deferred until perhaps midyear to evaluate such further adjustments in light of accumulated experience with a 50 basis point spread and shorter terms.  That concludes our prepared remarks.  We  would be happy to answer your questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Are there questions  for Jim or Bill?  President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Yes. Could you elaborate on what discussions with our directors you envision in January? 

[SECTION]

MR. NELSON. Discussions about the increase in the discount rate.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We’ ll need a recommendation. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. I see. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It’s been a while. MR. MADIGAN. But our view is that this is obviously a sensitive topic, so it might be better to hold off on th at for several weeks. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Rather than in this meeting? MR. MADIGAN. Right. No, I’m sorry, I’m talk ing about discussions with the boards of directors. 

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. With the board s of directors—I understand. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Bullard. MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a question on the term deposit facility. One of the provisions is “no early wi thdrawal,” but another provision is “you can be pledged as collateral at the window.” Those seem to be in conflict. 

[SECTION]

MR. CLOUSE. Both of them would give some potential for accessing liquidity.  I personally wouldn’t characterize it as  being in conflict.  It was a fine judgment on whether we should allow these to be pledged as collateral at the discount window, but the Federal Reserve has a long-standing policy of taking basically any asset that a bank can hold as collateral.  As   34 of 247long as the pricing for the primary credit program  is correct, as was pointed out at the last meeting, actually, there wouldn’t be strong incentives for an institution to pl edge collateral at the primary credit facility in order to invest it in a te rm deposit.  We would ensure that that sort of arbitrage was ruled out. And, of  course, there’s lots of stig ma around borrowing at the discount window, too, so the option value of that is probably not that high. I view it, anyway, as sort of a technical th ing.  Banks already have over $1 trillion worth of collateral pledged at the di scount window.  They could do a nything they need to at the primary credit window with any other form of colla teral.  So there’s nothi ng really special about the term deposit facility allowing th em to pledge those particular de posits as collateral.  It’s just to be consistent with our existing policy. 

[SECTION]

MR. BULLARD. Well, you might turn that around and say, “Then, why have a ‘no early withdrawal’ provision?” 

[SECTION]

MR. CLOUSE. Well, an early  withdrawal option is, fi rst of all, tremendously complicated to develop in the automated system .  The automated system has been developed, and, to put in that feature, would really greatly complicate things .  In addition, you have to worry a lot about where you set the penalty to guard agains t very frequent usage of that option.  So if you wanted to provide some capability for these in stitutions to access liquidity, it just seemed a lot more natural to keep access to liquidity in a facility where we understand exactly how things work. And, as you know, we don’t anticipate, esp ecially as we move to normalize the program, that institutions will be regularly  using the primary credit facilit y.  But I would say, too, that it will be interesting to review co mments on this from the public  

[SECTION]

MR. BULLARD. Is this the comment period for the Committee?     35 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Go ahead.  We don’t have this unstructured period, so consider this to be your  time to comment.  

[SECTION]

MR. BULLARD. Okay. One of the aspects of the TDF is, “well, now we’re going to drain reserves.” How meaningful is it to say that I’ve got an overnight  deposit at the central bank versus I’ve got a 30-day deposit at the cen tral bank, one of which I’m going to count as reserves and in the monetary base, and the othe r of which I’m not going to  count in that?  It seems to me the macroeconomic difference is very slight. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, you can’t lend the 30-day money in the overnight federal funds market. 

[SECTION]

MR. BULLARD. There’s a question about how li quid it really is, but it seems that it’s very substitutable. I can wait 30 days and take it out. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Mr. Chairman? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Is it useful to consider al ongside that question, President Bullard, the question of how a term deposit compares in liquid ity with an equal term Treasury holding, which is equally collateralizable, and, thus, equally liquid, but we c onsider a nonmonetary asset? 

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN. Indeed, the TDFs would be less liquid, because they can’t be sold. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Right. They’re nontransferab le.  There you go. It’s even less liquid than T-bills. 

[SECTION]

MR. BULLARD. There’s vari able liquidity among various assets, and you should have metrics about the degree of liquidity, and then get your measure of how much liquidity is out there, instead of arbitraril y saying certain assets are liquid and others are not.     36 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. For the reasons that you just described, I think it will be helpful in managing overnight inte rest rates.  Of course, there’ s always the question about the linkages between that and broad fi nancial conditions, but our typical target is the overnight rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. BULLARD. Do we expect th e interest rates in this facility to be anything other than the expected interest rate on reserves over the six months?  Plus a term premium. 

[SECTION]

MR. CLOUSE. The staff proposal envisions la rgely an auction facility to offer these deposits, and you might expect, then, that the au ction rate would stop out somewhat below a comparable term money market instrument, fo r example, maybe a little bit below LIBOR, reflecting the fact that we’re a risk-free counterparty rather  than a risky counterparty. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other que stions?  President Rosengren. 

[SECTION]

MR. ROSENGREN. Just a question on the prim ary credit rate.  We all have directors meetings at different times.  So if it’s purely a technical adjustment , it might be better to have a day that we all called our boards of directors at the same time.  I’m just a little worried that somebody might have a directors meeting in the first week of January, and though I know this is supposed to stay confidential, it might start leaking out.  So it just stri kes me that it would be better if we could just say on a certain day you will call your board and everybody talks about it as being a technical adju stment, if that’s truly what we think it is. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker. MR. LACKER. Yes, I was just going to suggest  that.  I think the re cord is that rate change requests from Reserve Banks have not  leaked—I don’t know of any example of rate requests that have leaked. I do think a little more formal coordination might be useful, in that, going into our January meetings, we’d know that we ’re getting the wink that the Board is likely to approve this technical adjustment.        37 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We’ll coordinate .  And we don’t n eed recommendations from all the Banks, of course, but just one.  We understand the need to co ordinate this in a way that is not going to create problem s.  Thank you. President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. It might also be a good tim e to remind directors.  There was one occasion when it was leaked, and it was a federal cr ime.  So it might be an appropriate time to remind directors, as we do all th e time, that any discussion of th e discount rate is confidential, and if there is a leak, it’s a federal offense. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well put.  President Plosser. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. I’d like to follow up a little bit on the TDF, because I’m still uncomfortable with the potential for arbitrag e between it and primary credit.  Jim, do you envision that the TAF will shut down before TDF becomes active? 

[SECTION]

MR. CLOUSE. That seems likely, given the market’s expectations. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Otherwise, I can imagine a ba nk lending to us at one rate and getting the TAF credit at 25 basis points, which is borro wing backed by posting TDF collateral.  It looks as if you’re going to cap the aucti on rate at the primary credit rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. CLOUSE. Well, we’d want to be sure that it couldn’t go higher than the primary credit rate, for sure. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Because otherwise you are invi ting them to game the system.  But if the term premium is not high enough, then that sort of enters into what maturities you’re going to offer, whether the term premium for six months or  a year would be so la rge that you couldn’t cap the TDF rate at the primary credit rate—that is, the spread wasn’t big enough.  So I’m just really puzzled about how all of this is going to sort itse lf out, and whether or not this is really going to be effective at draining any reserves at all.       38 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. There’s always some primary credit rate spread that’s big enough that you can slip anything you want to underneath it. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Right. But that spread will partly depend on what the range of maturities are that we offer at the TDF.  The longer the maturity, presumably the higher the premium, and whether we’ve got the spread high enough to cover th at would be something that we would have to sort of work on, I would think, in order to make it work. Will that end up raising interest rates?  Pres ident Kocherlakota was talking about this. Do these tools affect interest rates in some sense?  Is this just a backhanded way of raising rates, which we might as well raise anyway?  I’m still a little uncomfortable with how this is actually going to work and whether it’s going to  do what we think it’s going to do. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. This is great monetary economics.  [Laughter] You can have such a great graduate class. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Yes, right. If  I live that long.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other ques tions?  President Kocherlakota. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Yes. I’m going to follow up on some of the things President Plosser was saying. What we could do is raise the interest rate on ex cess reserves; we could offer this term deposit, which strikes me as like offering a certificate of deposit, a CD, to a bank, and they can lock in their funds—that’s offering a high interest rate on a particular kind of illiquid asset; or we could sell off MBS, but we’re  worried about raising th e rates there.  So I guess we’re going to defer all of this until January, and we’ll sort it all out at that point.  But there is this question about which interest rate we’re going to be manipula ting at a given point in time.  I’m not seeing clearly why this is the righ t interest rate to manipulate as opposed to the   39 of 247IOER rate or just selling agency MBS.  That’s th e part I’m not following.  But, again, maybe this will be cleared up in January. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I don’t want to interject, but I th ink there are two ways to look at it. One is just to say the IOER rate, whic h is an overnight rate, is the basic tool, and we just have all of these fine-tuning instruments to make sure we  don’t have too much slippage between the market rate—the fede ral funds rate—and the IOER rate .  That’s one approach, and I think that’s the simplest approach.  The other way, though, is to say, well, we really have tools that can affect things at different  parts of the term structure or di fferent types of instruments, and we can play with that if we want. That gets  more complicated and it makes policymaking more complicated.  So I don’t know how far we want to go in that direction, bu t I think there are at least two ways to look at that. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Just to follow up—if I’m a bank, why would I put my reserves into this account  unless it paid a higher interest rate  than the IOER ra te?  Because it’s less liquid. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It will. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Okay. So, at least as far as I can see, it’s not just fine-tuning that gap between the fed funds rate and the IOER rate.  It’s actually pl aying with the various aspects of the term structure in some fashion.  And maybe that’s the right  way for us to proceed. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Market operations ar e swaps of assets for assets.  We’re swapping reserves for deposits. President Evans. 

[SECTION]

MR. EVANS. Something about President Pl osser’s question made me think about stigma.  Jim, you mentioned this, too.  If you were a bank, and you had these term deposits, and then something happened and you went to the window—which is just a normal type of thing—        40 of 247would you be worried? In the old days, if we were  worried about arbitrage,  then the supervisor would make a phone call.  It seems that we would have to be very clear in mentioning that it would still be okay to access the window under the right conditions, and that you wouldn’t get a call from the supervisor.  Or, if they’re worried about that, then they might just not bid on the term deposits, and it doesn’t amount to anything.  It might be a little tricky. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes. We left that  old regime, of course, when we moved the discount rate above the funds rate. 

[SECTION]

MR. EVANS. Right. That’s why it’s okay. Of  course, they still don’t borrow.  At some point, Jim mentioned that stigma is our friend—I wrote that down—or  at least that it could help us with something. But we think that stigma will make this arbitrage go away.  It’s just something to think about. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any other questions?  [No response.]  I could press on just a bit more.  Our friend Dave Stockton is a victim of H1N1 flu virus.  David Wilcox has stepped into the breach, so let me  turn it over to David. 

[SECTION]

MR. WILCOX.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be delivering remarks this morning that were, for the most part, prep ared by Dave Stockton, who can’t be with us today, as the Chairman mentioned, becau se of illness.  I should note that such circumstances may have little historical precedent.  My colleagues and I have now completed an exhaustive search of the Na tional Archives, checking all the critical original source material, and found no in stance in which Robin had to clean up Gotham City on his own because Batman was indisposed; and no mention of Tonto ever having to face mortal peril by himself because the Lone Ranger was back at the ranch recuperating from the latest flu pande mic.  My colleagues in Public Affairs often emphasize the importance of  expectations management, so in that spirit, I have set myself the bar of hoping that today’s proceedings go better than when Captain Edward Smith asked First Officer Murdoch to take a turn at the helm of the Titanic [Laughter.] Now turning to Dave’s remarks—I am speaking in Dave’s voice: I’d like to do three things this afternoon. First, we have received an unusually large slug of data since the close of the Greenbook, so I will provide a brief update on the near-term forecast. Sec ond, I’d like to summarize our take on where we are in the     41 of 247recovery process at present. And finally, I will point out what we see as the major sources of uncertainty su rrounding the economic outlook. Since we published the forecast last Wedne sday, we have received readings on retail sales, merchandise trade, invent ories, consumer sentiment, industrial production, and producer prices. The retail sales data for Nove mber were right in line with our projection. As you know, we had b een rather skeptical  earlier in the fall when the consumer spending data began to show improvement.  We thought incoming data.  However, some of that tension was reduced by the sizable upward revisions that the BEA made to its estimate s of labor income in the second and third quarters. Those revisions suggest that th e recovery in consumer spending is on a firmer footing.  Last Friday’s read ing on consumer sentiment from the Reuters/Michigan survey showed a furt her modest improvement that also is consistent with the pickup in spending that we have witnessed of late.  All told, we now estimate that real PCE increased at an  annual rate of ab out 2½ percent in the second half, no different from our forecast of  last Wednesday, but about ½ percentage point faster than our October forecast. We also received data on retail inventor ies late last week.  Retail inventories outside the motor vehicle sector ran off at  a slower pace in October than we had expected, adding a couple of tenths to our forecast of growth in real GDP in the current quarter. And the somewhat stronge r-than-expected figures for exports in tenths to current quarter growth.  Nathan w ill have a bit more to say about that in a few moments.  Taken together, the inventory and trade data would lead us to revise up estimated growth in real GDP in the cu rrent quarter to an annual rate of about 4¼ percent. Earlier today, we published our first estimate of industrial production in manufacturing output rose 1.1 percent.  We pride ourselves on cultivating a high degree of collegiality in the Division of Research and St atistics, so it comes as no surprise to find out that we had built a pret ty good forecast of these results into last week’s Greenbook [laughter]. All told, and notwithstanding the downbeat tone to the industrial sector remains on track for a sec ond consecutive quarter of 6+ percent rate of growth, thus beginning the process of digging out from some very steep earlier This brings me to the second issue that I wanted to touch on this afternoon, which is, given all that we have seen in the past six weeks, where do we think we are in the cyclical process?  These coul d well prove to be famous last words, but I believe that the accumulating evidence supports the view that a moderate recovery is under way and, indeed, that the recovery is gaining greater traction.  Not only have we seen an     42 of 247acceleration in aggregate output, but the composition of that acceleration seems favorable for activity going forward. Importa ntly, domestic final sales are firming.  The key elements of that firming include a recovery in housing, the aforementioned turnaround in consumer spending, and a st abilization in spending on capital goods.  Moreover, exports are getting a boost from the improvement in global activity.  And with the overall prospects fo r sales looking brighter, busin esses appear to be lifting production further in order to sl ow the runoff of inventories. Finally, we are now seeing more encour aging—albeit still tent ative—signs that the deterioration in the labor market is abat ing.  Declines in private payrolls averaged 90,000 per month over the past three months.  That compares with job losses that were averaging about 700,000 per month earlie r this year and were still running at about 425,000 per month at midyear.  Other indicators that labor market conditions are beginning to turn include an upswing in  temporary help employment in recent months and a jump in the workweek in November.  And since the November survey week, initial claims for unemployment in surance have contin ued to drift down. While the probability that we have entere d a self-sustaining re covery appears to have increased appreciably, considerable ri sks continue to attend our forecast.  One risk that has been highlighted  by the recent data is that of a sharper acceleration of activity, driven in part by a more rapid attempt by businesses to halt a further runoff of inventories and perhaps even add to stoc ks.  The book value inventory data that we have for October show a small accumulation of stocks in the ma nufacturing and trade sectors after a long period of huge liquida tions, and a sharp rebound in activity caused by a swing in the inventory cycle has been a feature of some previous, more V-shaped recoveries. In our forecast, we have a ssumed that the positive figure for October overstates the underlying upswing, and we have penciled in further moderate declines in inventories for the remainder of the qua rter.  We have done so because we just haven’t seen or heard much that would indi cate that a substantia lly greater snapback in inventory investment is  providing a major lift to production.  The national and regional purchasing managers’ reports point  to ongoing increases in factory output, but moderate ones—not a sudden or sharp pop in  activity.  And my reading is that the reports given in the Beige Book do not seem consistent with an i nventory-led surge of major proportions in production. But if we are misreading the situation a nd the liquidation of inventories is coming to an end more abruptly than we are proj ecting, then the growth of real GDP could easily outstrip our 4¼ percent es timate in the current quarter , and if past patterns were to prevail, we could see several quarters of  outsized increases in real GDP.  In the first instance, a faster turn around in inventory investment would pull forward some of the growth that we have proj ected to be stretched out over the next couple of years.  But greater near-term strength could beget stronger household and business confidence and spending, as well as a faster relaxation of the terms on which credit is being offered to households and nonfinancial  businesses, all of which could amplify the effects on the growth of real GDP, th e path of resource utilization, and price         43 of 247inflation. We will be monitoring these cyclical forces carefully in the period immediately ahead. Despite the generally more favorable tenor  of the incoming data of late, there remain considerable downside risks to  the Greenbook projection as well.  One prominent risk is that final sales peter out next year rather than  accelerating further as we are forecasting. After declining at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the first half, final sales appear to be increasing at about a 2 pe rcent pace in th e second half, and we are projecting a 3 percent advance in  2010.  Much of next year’s acceleration occurs in spending for durable goods, especially business investme nt.  In our view, improving cash flows, an ample stock of li quid assets, increasing confidence in the durability of the recovery, the release of  some pent-up demand, and a further easing of financial strains should pr ovide noticeable impetus to investment spending.  But it is possible that we are too optimistic in our  expectation of furthe r easing of financial conditions, including the terms of lending fr om the banking sector , or we could be attributing too much staying power to the stimulus being provided by fiscal policy. A second risk relates to the labor market .  As I noted earlier, we have been encouraged by the recent data.  But it is important to note that, to date, the smaller employment declines have principally been driven by a reduction in layoffs.  As yet, we have seen few signs of a widespread pi ckup in hiring in readings from the JOLTS data, the NFIB survey of small businesses, or measures of help-wanted or job availability. We expect to see increasi ng signs of hiring in the months ahead as businesses grow more confident of the rec overy.  But anecdotal reports suggest that businesses remain very cautious.  If that cau tion persists longer th an we expect, hiring could remain weak and slack in labor market s could fail to recede to the extent we are projecting. We made only very minor adjustments to our inflation projection this round.  The incoming data on overall PCE prices were  a bit above our projection.  But the surprises were almost completely the resu lt of a somewhat faster pass through of crude oil and natural gas pri ces to the retail level and higher than expected nonmarket prices, which we think have little signal content for underlying inflation.  As a consequence, although we have revised up the projected increase in  total PCE prices in the current quarter by ¾ pe rcentage point to 2¾ percen t, we have revised down the projected increase in the firs t quarter by nearly the same amount to about 1 percent. The increase in energy prices that was reported in this morning’s PPI release surprised us to the upside, but in the pa st, producer prices for energy have been a pretty noisy indicator of developments at  the retail level, so we are withholding judgment pending tomorrow’s CPI release.  Unlike PPI energy prices, the PPI for medical care does feed directly into the PCE price index, and these prices were a little lower than we had expected, shaving perhap s a tenth or two o ff our projection for core PCE inflation in the fourth quarter. Looking beyond the near term, we revised up our forecast for core PCE prices by a tenth in both 2010 and 2011 to reflect some what higher projected import prices and       44 of 247a slightly smaller margin of slack.  Reflecting these revisions as well as some change in the profile of energy pri ces, we lowered projected overa ll PCE inflation by a tenth in 2010 to 1.3 percent and rais ed the projection by two tent hs in 2011 to 1.2 percent.  Nathan will continue our presentation. 

[SECTION]

MR. SHEETS. The foreign economic rec overy has continued to broaden and deepen. We now judge that real GDP abro ad expanded at a 4¼ percent rate in the third quarter. The emerging market ec onomies (EMEs) continued to lead the rebound, with growth strengthening in the thir d quarter to a 9 percent pace.  Notably, the Mexican economy bounced back vigorousl y, as it shook off the restraining effects of the H1N1 virus and as automotive production there resumed.  Third-quarter growth in emerging Asia stepped down from the 15 pe rcent surge in the pr evious quarter but remained near 10 percent, as activity in th e region continued to benefit from policy stimulus and the rebound in global trade.   In the advanced foreign economies, real GDP growth turned slightly positive on average in the third quarter, after five consecutive quarters of contraction.  But the bad news is that final domestic demand remained quite sluggish in many of these economies, including the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Fourth quarter data suggest that growth  in the EMEs is moderating to a more sustainable 5 percent pace, which we believe is  likely to continue through the forecast period. We note that the vigor of the r ecovery in emerging Asia has kicked off rebounds in asset prices in the region and led to concerns that bubbles may be forming.  While the city-states of H ong Kong and Singapore have seen marked increases in real estate pri ces, property prices in other Asian economies are flat or up only moderately, and forward-looking price–earnings ratios for equities are within historical ranges. Of course, we will c ontinue to monitor th is issue closely going forward. For the advanced economies, we forecast that growth will strengthen from just under 1 percent in the third qua rter to over 3 percent by 2011.  We expect that private spending in these economies will eventually pick up, boosted by normalizing financial and credit conditions, improvi ng economic sentiment, and the ongoing recovery in the United States. The possibili ty that private spending in the advanced economies might rebound more slowly than we now envision is an important downside risk to our outlook, both for th ese economies and for export-dependent emerging markets. This month marks the 20th anniversary of the peak of the Japanese equity bubble, and policymakers there continue to struggl e to find a formula that will allow the economy to shake off its sustained malaise. Japan was hit hard by the collapse in global trade during the crisis , but the country is now r ecording a strong rebound in its exports to emerging Asia, and its banks di d not have the same exposure to toxic financial assets that has plagued many ot her advanced-economy banking systems.  Nevertheless, the prospects for Japanese re covery remain quite uncertain.  After an encouraging second quarter rebound, Japanese  GDP growth slowed to a meager       45 of 2471¼ percent pace in the third quarter.  Privat e demand continues to be soft, held back by weaknesses in labor and housing markets.   The recent strengthening of the yen is another source of restraint, and headline co nsumer price deflati on intensified to a record 2½ percent in October. Apart from our concerns about the apparent  intensification of Japanese deflation, we expect that foreign infl ation will remain well behaved through the forecast period, averaging around 2 percent per year. This  projection is shaped by ongoing evidence that inflation expectations abroad are ge nerally well anchored and by our view that economic slack will remain sizable in many c ountries, even at the end of the forecast period. In addition, in line with quotes from  futures markets, our forecast calls for commodity prices to be relatively well contained going forward.  Since your last meeting, the spot price of WTI [West Texas Intermediate] oil has fallen $10 per barrel, to about $70. A portion of this decr ease was unique to WTI, but last week the prices of other grades of oil posted notable declines as well. We continue to watch for si gns as to when the foreign authorities will withdraw policy stimulus.  On the fiscal front , new governments in Germany and Japan announced measures that should give so me small additional support to their recoveries and that signal a continuing commitment to stim ulative policies.  However, the potential constraints on fiscal policy were underscored by the credit rating agencies’ recent moves to downgrade Greek sovereign debt and to place Spain and Portugal on negative watch, in response to c oncerns about the sustainability of their respective fiscal positions. S&P [Standard  & Poor’s] yesterday joined Fitch in downgrading Mexico’s credit rating to BBB,  citing the country’s diminishing oil production, failure to expand its narrow non- oil tax base, and diminished prospects for fiscal reforms during the second half of President Calderón’s term. As for monetary policy, the Bank of Engla nd increased its asset-purchase facility by £25 billion, and the Bank of Japan intr oduced a three-month lending facility.  Although the European Central Bank a nnounced plans to begin winding up its exceptional liquidity support facilities, mark ets seem to have pushed back a bit the expected start of monetary policy tight ening by the ECB and other major central banks. Our forecast calls for the Bank of Ca nada to begin tightening policy in the second half of next year and for the E CB and BOE to follow suit in early 2011.  We anticipate that the BOJ will k eep its policy rate at 10 basis points through the end of the forecast period. The foreign exchange value of the dolla r fell through the month of November but has since rebounded vigorously on stronger-th an-expected U.S. data.  On net, the dollar is little changed since the last FOMC meeting.  The dollar’s moves against the yen were particularly marked, as it traded briefly in late November as low as 85 against the yen, prompting market chatte r that the Japanese  authorities would intervene to forestall furthe r appreciation of their currenc y.  The dollar subsequently rallied, closing above 89 against the yen, down less than 2 percent over the intermeeting period.  The dollar also dec lined against the Korean won and the     46 of 247Mexican peso, but moved up against the eu ro, the Swiss franc, and the Brazilian real. Relative to its peak in early March this year, the nominal broa d dollar index is down 12 percent, but it still remains roughly 7 percent above its 2008 trough.  Our forecast maintains the working assumption that the real broad dollar index will depreciate at roughly a 2 percent pace on average over the next two years. Last week, after the Greenbook went to be d, we received the October trade data.  Exports showed greater-than-expected strength; the gains were broad-based, but particularly large for capita l and consumer goods.  In response, we have marked up our projection for fourth quarter export grow th by nearly 4 percentage points to a robust 16 percent clip. Imports also surprised on the upside, albeit to a lesser extent.  The upshot is that net exports are likely to add ¼ percentage point more to GDP growth in the fourth quarter than we anticipated in the Greenbook, bringing their contribution to ½ percentage point. Going forward, export growth should proceed at about a 9 percent pace through the next two years, stimulated by declines in the do llar and the ongoing rebound in foreign activity.  Import growth is likely to be a bit slower, in the ballpark of 7½ percent, supported by the U.S. recovery but restrained by headwinds from  the dollar.  Because imports grow from a higher base, however, the contribut ion of net exports to U.S. GDP  growth is expected to be roughly neutral over the forecast period.   Thank you.  That concludes our prepared remarks.  We’re happy to take your questions.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Why don’t we recommence and begin our go-round?   President Rosengren.   47 of 247MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We have had some heartening news since the last meeting.  In particular, the em ployment report was stronger than most analysts expected, with the economy losing only 11,000 jobs.  However, it is obvious, but still important, to emphasize that this is still moving in the wr ong direction.  As the recovery progresses, a good employment report will be one that adds jobs substa ntially faster than grow th in the labor force, so we can make significant progress in reduc ing the unemployment rate and reattaining full employment. The Greenbook has the unemployment rate at 9.6 percent at the end of 2010, with an assumption of no change in the federal funds ra te.  Unfortunately, my own forecast is quite similar.  Initial claims for unemployment insura nce remain quite elevated.  We need to see a significant reduction in job loss and a marked incr ease in hiring if we are going to achieve net increases in employment that significantly exceed growth in the labor force.  Other labor market trends highlight why the progress is likely to be slow in bringing the unemployment rate down.  First, the fraction of employed persons working pa rt-time for economic reasons is nearly at an all-time high for the series.  Second, the work week of production and non-supervisory workers remains low relative to non-recessionary periods.  With many workers on a reduced workweek, or involuntarily on part-time work, many busines ses will defer hiring new employees until their existing workforce is more fully utilized.  Thus , even if GDP growth exceeds potential, as I expect it will over the coming quarters, this will likely reduce the unemployment rate only gradually. Headwinds from the banking sector are also likely to continue to blow strongly.  The percent of bank assets in institutions with low supervisory rati ngs continues to grow, and bank failures are artificially being he ld down by resource constraints at the FDIC.  Given the volume    48 of 247of problem loans and problem banks, it is probabl y time to have a Resolution Trust Corporation to deal with failed bank assets. Recovery in comme rcial real estate will be delayed if the public and private sectors hold large inventories of pr oblem commercial real estate loans in the hope that losses will be avoided through forbearance. On the inflation front, there is little evidence of inflationary pre ssures.  A variety of models used by the Boston Fed expect continue d disinflation.  For models that depend on resource slack, the very high unemployment rate relative to any reasonable estimate of full employment suggests further disinflation.  However, recognizing the difficulties in measuring unemployment and output gaps, we have also exam ined models that emphasize the role of real have been falling dramatically and are curr ently at a postwar low.  With double-digit unemployment, I don’t expect a quic k reversal in real unit labor costs.  Furthermore, our model suggests that, even in the pres ence of extremely well-anchored  inflation expectations, the downward pull from resource underutilization ma y well outweigh the stabilizing effect of anchored expectations. Thus, while the high-frequency data have cl early improved from earlier this year, they have not changed enough to significantly alter the outlook of an economy with very weak labor markets and a significant risk of furthe r disinflation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Th e Eighth District business conditions are showing modest improvement, according to many business contacts.  However, business leaders remain very cautious about the outlook for the economy.  This is affecting business behavior with respect to capital expend iture plans for 2010, and it is also  having a big effect on hiring  49 of 247plans. The cautious mood is typically attributed to three factors.  One is weak demand for final products, although that aspect is improving modes tly.  The second is uncertainty over the scope and nature of national policy changes, as often c ited by business contacts.  One contact said in a meeting, “Tell me what the rules are; tell me what the tax rates are—I will proceed with business planning then and only then.” The third factor is a residual pessimism concerning the direction of the economy over the next two years, worries that the economy simply will not recover as it has in the past—the idea is that something f undamental has changed in  the economy and may not be in the process of repair. Energy firms in the Eighth District report w eak conditions in the U.S.  Low energy usage and high levels of inventory accumulation are lead ing to continued cuts in hours in employment in that sector. In Asia, in c ontrast, the energy sector is very robust as we heard earlier in our report on the international conditions. Large transportation firms in the District repo rt increasing volumes for the first time in a long time, as well as increasing revenues.  Th ese firms have been surprised on the upside regarding Christmas activity.  They’ve had to  scramble to meet transportation demands, especially from Asia, in recent weeks. Banking conditions are generally weak in the Ei ghth District, as I’m sure they are across the country. Commercial real estate remains a huge concern.  Bankers generally felt that the FDIC does not have the resources or  a plan to close banks as rapi dly as necessary in the current environment.  Many contacts are worried, in addition, about a looming crisis in state-level financing. I have heard ea rfuls about that problem. On the national outlook, it looks as if we re main on track for a strengthening economy in 2010. I was encouraged by the strength of the November employment report.  Despite the drop  50 of 247in jobs, it was much less than expected.  I think it’s reasonable to expect positive payrolls in the first months of 2010.  Positive GDP growth in the third quarter, and apparently now in the fourth quarter, suggests the recession has ended in term s of rule-of-thumb metrics.  But I want to remind the Committee, because employment is only now turning the corner, the actual recession end date may be closer to the end of 2009, as opposed to mid-2009.  This issue has an arbitrary flavor to it, but it does affect  popular perceptions of the state of the economy, as well as both consumer and business expectations. Financial market stress continue s to abate.  It’s important to remember that some stress does remain.  If we were comparing January 2007, a pre-crisis date, to today, without the intervening period, we would be am azed at how much financial market stress was out there.  We would be saying that financial market stress is well above normal compared to that benchmark.  It’s only because that stress was so high last fall that it seems relatively less painful today.  Still, I’m encouraged by the improvements that we’ve s een, and I expect further improvement in the first half of 2010 in financial markets. I think an important question for the Committee, and for the outlook, is:  Could financial period with events in the Middle East. I th ink it could reemerge, although the levels of government guarantees worldwide that were implemented during 2008 and 2009 suggest that to zero. On the inflation side, I think inflation risks remain confined to the medium-term, anywhere from two to five years from now.  Actions we take today and through 2010 will shape those risks. I would stress agai n that current policy is complete ly unprecedented in the postwar   51 of 247U.S. period. Uncertainty is high, both around this  table and in financial markets, on what the effects of our policies will be. Econometric analysis using data from the last 25 years is unlikely to provide a completely reliable guide to possible outcomes in this situation. On balance sheet issues, as I have said befo re, I still prefer that the Committee take a more active stance on managing th e balance sheet going forward.  I thought the memo from the Desk and Brian Sack’s discussion today on runoff i ssues for the balance sheet made it clear that there is nothing optimal about pursuing any of th e passive strategies.  These are just possible strategies that we could pursue,  but an optimal strategy would so mehow talk about how we were going to react to the incoming information on the economy during the period of zero interest rates, which, according to the Greenbook, will still be most of—or all of—the next two years. The idea of taking a completely passive appro ach to balance sheet issues is very much counter to all that we have learned about optim al monetary policy over the last 25 years.  The asset-purchase program, at least according to the analysis by st aff, is thought to have an important real effect on the economy.  So my  question is:  Why ignore these effects when developing plans to get the balance sheet back to normal size over some time horizon?  If the economy performs better than expected, we may want to normalize the balance sheet sooner than 2016, or later, as would happen under a passive policy.  If the economy performs worse than expected—suppose we are back in recession next fall—it seems clear that we would want to expand purchases further. And let me reiterate the amount of  uncertainty that is inherent in any forecast.  If you just look at the staff estimates of uncertainty, for in stance, 6 percent real GDP growth in 2011 is actually within the Greenbook’s 70 pe rcent confidence interval.  So that’s one possible outcome, and it is not an outlandish outco me.  When you get nine months, a year, 18 months down the  52 of 247line, the economy may look very different from what it looks like today.  And we have to have policies in place to be ready for those types of possible outcomes. Announcing the end of the asset-purchase progra m in the first quarter of 2010 is not as transparent as I would like, because it suggests th at we would not take further actions, when in fact we would in certain states of the world, as long as interest rates remain near zero.  So it would also be helpful to be able to make sma ller adjustments meeting by meeting as information arrives on the state of the economy, as we w ould with our interest rate instrument. Finally, if we can, we would lik e to move the unsavory assets that have caused us some trouble off the balance sheet faster than current pr ojections envision, but in a way that would still support recovery. We could do that in one of two ways.  We could replace them with Treasuries, which was discussed a little bit ea rlier, or we could just sell them  outright, as appropriate, but in a way that would not upset financial market s and cause a backup in rates.  Thank you.

MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Ec onomic activity in the Third District has remained slow, but there has been some impr ovement in a number of sectors, including manufacturing, retail sales, and residential real estate.  The outlook by our firms continues to be for low levels of activity, but most of our c ontacts say they believe that conditions have bottomed out and will improve, but they remain very cautious about the future. Let me start with some very good news, which seems appropriate in this holiday season.  Our manufacturing survey’s genera l activity index in November ro se for the fourth consecutive month, up to 16.7 from 11.5 in October.  Our De cember survey, which will be released, and, therefore, is embargoed until Thursday at 10: 00 a.m., also shows an increase, up to 20.4.  Another positive note was delivered on the employme nt index of our survey, which moved from 53 of 247negative territory, where it ha d been for many, many, many, ma ny, many months, into positive territory for the first time, at 6.3.  Both of those number s seem consistent with a steady improvement in the general activity index, and the growth and positive number for employment were particularly encouraging. Retail sales in the District improved slightly in  November for most of  our stores and most lines of merchandise, including autos, which had dropped off at the end of the “cash-for­clunkers” program.  The retailers we spoke to are cautious about holid ay sales.  They are keeping inventories leaner and moving to lower-quality items and, therefore, lower-priced merchandise, which is going to make it a bit more difficult, I think, to interpret the re tail sales numbers going forward. Employment in the three states continues to decline, but the rate of decline has slowed considerably, consistent with that in the nation.  We don’t have the November employment numbers yet, but, so far, for the last 12 months, the pace of job losses in each of our states has been less than that in the nation. And the tri- state unemployment rate is only 9.2 percent in this gap is maintained when the Nove mber numbers come out next Friday. The commercial real estate market remains w eak—no surprise there.  Our contacts expect construction and leasing to remain at low levels well into next year.  This matters for many banks in our District, because they have exposure to, and are responding to, and not lending to, developers. Indeed, bank lending continues to  contract across all categories—consumers, businesses, and real estate. Bankers report that the declines, though, reflect both supply and demand factors.  They have tightened credit stan dards, although most seem to suggest that they are not continuing  to tighten credit standard s; that is, the bankers we  spoke to seem to be  54 of 247comfortable where they are for now. Lending is down, but it seems to be as much a lack of demand as a lack of credit suppl y, especially to businesses.  Most banks reported continuing deterioration in credit quality across all loan cate gories, but some said th e rise in delinquencies and defaults appeared to be slow ing.  I would note that in the NFIB  survey that came out about a week ago, small businesses ranked the lack of de mand for their goods as a much bigger problem than the lack of credit. As demand rises more  generally in the econom y, the credit quality of these firms is likely to improve, and they will increase demand for loans, and lending will be forthcoming as their credit quality improves.  That wi ll be a natural part of the cyclical response of a recovering economy. At the national level, my reading of the da ta is that the improvement in economic and financial market conditions appears to be ga ining momentum, and the likelihood that recovery will be sustainable has increased.  Indeed, I thi nk conditions in financial markets have improved more quickly than many of us had predicted.  We ’ve been lucky that some of the downside risks we saw a year ago—including the possibility of steeper-than-expected ho use price declines, and no improvement in equity prices—didn’t happen,  while some of the upside risks, including faster-than-expected growth abroad and a more rapi d decline in the dollar, did, in fact, occur.  So sometimes we have to take the good news when it comes, and it may be smarter to be lucky than it’s lucky to be smart sometimes. Employment, retail sales, housing, and manufact uring activity continue to improve.  The been driven by seasonals or even one particular sector.  The pace of job losses has slowed pretty significantly over the past few months, and initia l claims for unemployment insurance, including both the state and federal programs, have m oved down.  Households seem to have made  55 of 247significant progress in getting thei r balance sheets more in order, and consumer spending has picked up more than expected.  Caution, low sentiment, in addition to tight credit, may be holding back some of the spending, but that could easily change if improvements in labor markets continue.  In the Greenbook, consumption is  forecast to grow less than real income, but given the low level of consumption, this would actually seem to be an upside risk in the forecast. Private sector forecasters have been revising up their forecasts based on recent data.  I think it would be prudent for us to recognize that  the recovery may be more robust than we had been expecting and that the equilibr ium real rates of interest may ri se faster than anticipated.  If so, we will need to be ready to begin reduci ng the degree of monetary policy accommodation sooner than later, which means we may want to be gin signaling this in our statement.  As real rates rise, the opportunity cost of  banks holding on to vast excess reserves may lead to a rapid increase in the money multiplier and a conversio n of excess reserves into loans or borrowed money. This may happen very quickly and requ ire a rapid response on our part, and we should anticipate this with the language in our statements, so that we don’t get caught off guard.  Thus, I see a greater upside risk in the medium term—the  two- to five-year term —to inflation than the Greenbook does. Inflation expectations for now remain stable.  I’m encouraged by that.  But, again, oil and commodity prices have begun to rise again. Who knows their effect on expectations going forward?  We must be cauti ous in our interpretati on of those events.  Similarly, the fall in the dollar, while positive fo r growth, may be signaling increased inflation expectations.  All this reinforces  my view that we are likely go ing to have to begin withdrawing some of this extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that we have put into place sooner than anticipated in the Greenbook baseline forecast.    56 of 247And we will need to begin communicating this possibility to the publ ic.  Otherwise, we desire, because our language will have constrained us.  As growth rates rise, we are going to have to allow interest rates to increase and not take those increases as signals of market dysfunction that need policy inte rvention.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Lockhart. 

[SECTION]

MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Th e sentiment of directors and contacts in the Sixth District supports a modest recovery  scenario.  In the most recent cycle of board meetings, surveys, and calls, I heard views that  suggest an improving but  still quite fragile economic reality.  We collected a number of comments that repres ent “color,” and not much that raised doubts about the modestly better conditions.  We heard reports of better retail spending for appliances and building materials.  This was conf irmed by last Friday’s retail sales estimate.  Retail sales improvement, however, seems to be tied to deep price discounts, and we heard retailers are not building inventor ies in anticipation of  a sustained spending pickup.  We heard that retailers are prepared to lose sales for lack of in-store inventory. We also heard reports that temporary hiring has increased, and that, too, was reflected in the most recent employment report for November.  Temp agencies told us that they are seeing growth in higher-level administra tive jobs.  Anecdotal feedback also supported the story that President Bullard pointed out—tha t policy uncertainty about health care, taxes, regulation, and cap and trade is feeding a very cautious approach to business investment and hiring. The Atlanta Bank’s economic growth and recovery  forecast continues to foresee a path to the downside of the Greenbook outlook, particul arly in 2011 and 2012.  Notwithstanding some better-than-expected incoming data, I am holding to the view that there are formidable and very    57 of 247likely persistent suppressing f actors that will inhibit a buildup  of growth momentum.  Our greatest concerns are centered on business investme nt and the impact of commercial real estate value contraction on bank credit to smaller businesses, which ultimately affects job growth. We looked more deeply at the inventory and the commercial real estate-related concerns during the intermeeting period and did not find re ason to adjust our fore cast assumptions.  We found that, while inventories are lean in a few retail categories, signi ficant excess inventory remains in many manufacturing categories. We also  found that there is a strong coincidence of banks with commercial real estate exposure in  excess of three times capital and small business loan share. An implication of the At lanta Bank’s outlook is very slow progress on unemployment and underemployment. As regards price stability, I remain of the view that upside inflation risk is not much of a concern for the near and medium term.  I find it ha rd to pinpoint a source of broad inflationary pressure and see some indications of disinflation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As pointed out by First Officer Murdoch and his shipmate, Nathan Sheets, [laughter] we ha ve seen some rather startling economic data recently—a less negative unemployment report, just to take President Rosengren’s interpretation, and some indications of improved consumer dynamics and a much improved international economic growth scene.  Financial markets, I th ink, are robust.  Key spreads have continued to narrow. We’ve had some major announcements regarding TARP repayments and some significant nonfinancial transac tions involving firms mainly in  my District, for example, Buffett’s acquisition of Burli ngton Northern and Exxon’s deal with TXO announced yesterday.  These developments are encouraging.  They indicate to me the recovery is under way.  58 of 247But I’m still in a “trust but verify” mode, mainly based on the anecdotal evidence that I’m picking up, which is mixed, from my contacts.   I’m beginning to detect a faint demand-pull heartbeat among bulk shippers—air freight operators  like UPS and Federal Express and the rails.  Long-distance telephone usage is up slightly year over year.  That ’s always an interesting sign, in this case driven by call center activity. And yet the retailers report se quential sli ppage month over month and year over year for December thus far, with Wal-Mart and Penney’s especially concerned about the bottom three income quartiles  for Christmas and for the first half of the year. Pricing power, as I think Dennis just referred to, eludes producers in most sectors.  Retailers who look back at their Black Friday acti vity and activity since then report ultra-price­sensitive consumption, although I w ould note that the tw o large express shippers have announced increases in prices coming on January 4.  The announced number is 4 percent—if you look at the way that’s practiced, it will probably be a net rate  of 2 percent.  And there are reports that Wal-One worrisome development that I have h eard about is in re tail supply.  Chinese suppliers to retailers are attemp ting to renegotiate the price concessions for soft goods for 2010.  Most of the merchants report that they have rebuffed them, but they do not believe they can continue to hold off doing so into the second half of 2010 an d 2011, as Chinese manufacturers’ expectations are for a reversal in  sign from a minus 3 to 4 percent for soft goods to plus 3 to 5 percent as we proceed through the second half  of 2010, assuming that consumption holds up.  59 of 247On the balance sheet front, I could det ect no change in this go-round with my interlocutors.  The capital markets are pretty much wide open to the big boys who are still hoarding cash. Most, with the exception of energy companies, such as Exxon, which are focused on longer-term natural gas—a play that they consider defensive—are sitting on large cash reserves. Few are expecting to expand their cap-ex domestically until both the political and economic skies are clear. As to the small guys, they continue to complain about the paucity of bank credit.  As to budgeting head count and other operating overhea d for 2010, the new ubiquitous buzzwords are “ZOG” and “NOG.” The bias is towards ZOG, which is zero overhead growth, or NOG, which is negative overhead growth.  This will not likely change until they see the whites of the eyes of top-line growth in their revenues. It remains el usive.  Those who do see it are pursuing what is known in the parlance of consulting as the HOG a pproach, which is budgeting their overhead to half the overhead growth they would otherwise commit to, becaus e of gnawing uncertainty and a newfound ability to drive higher productivity.  That’s the big business crowd.   The little guys, the small businesses, rema in in a very defensive crouch.  Small businesses’ inventory investment plans are at historically low le vels.  Their capital spending is on hold. Actual outlays and pla nned outlays are at record low levels.  More small firms, according to what I can glean, still plan on reducing employment than plan on adding to their payrolls. And as you have pointed out, Mr. Chai rman, this is vexing, because we all know that, during recoveries, small firms typically account fo r a large share of employment gains.  We’ve done some research on this at the Da llas Fed.  In each of the 1983-1984, 1993, and 2003 expansions, the vast majority of employment ga ins were generated by firms with fewer than 500 employees.  What we don’t know is the degree to which cap-ex expansion of the larger firms  60 of 247drives that growth in employment in smaller firm s.  For example, El Paso Natural Gas has just announced financing for a pipeline. It will a dd 5,000 employees to its own payroll, but in building that pipeline, of course, you feed into the small businesses that provide the supplies to those employees and the construction of that pipelin e.  To the extent that smaller firms are more reliant on bank finance, it’s obvious that their re cuperative powers are being affected by tight bank credit. As to the larger firms that have come to access financial markets ra ther readily and are less constrained by bank financing, they still appear , according to my interlocutors, reluctant to expand overhead and especially agnostic as to  the need yet to e xpand domestic payrolls. I will just add to what several presidents  have already mentioned by using a specific reference. A CEO just came back from touring th e world.  This is a co mpany that supplies ten million small businesses with a vital component on the IT side, and his response after the trip was, “Every country I went to—India, China, The Czech Republic, Brazil, Vietnam—said, ‘What can we do for you?  How can we help you?  We’ll give you low taxes.  We’ll give you a building. We’ll give you land.’  I come back here and it’s, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that, you can’t do this, you can’t do that.’” That attitude, Mr. Chairman, is definitely having a depressive effect. It has nothing to do with m onetary policy, but it is hol ding back the desire to expand payroll and cap-ex and adding to the ZOG and to the NOG. As to the price pressure front , headline CPI rates have been increasing steadily these past few months.  The 12-month headline rate will so on turn positive, maybe with tomorrow’s report.  The Empire State data released today or yesterday indicate some  building price pressure on what comes in the door, despite the weakness that was in  that report.  Both core CPI and core PCE posted annualized one-month rate s above 2 percent in October, and the 12-month rates have   61 of 247ticked up to a little over 1.7 percent.  The directio n of change from negative to positive might ordinarily ruffle a hawk’s feathers, but for now I remain unalarmed.  In part this is because of what accounts for the increase:  excise taxes on tobacco sales and a number of small items that are a bit obscure to me, other than  the prices of new motor vehicl es, such as the price index for consumption expenditures for nonprofit institutions, and two other dodgy financial service components, the price index for financial services  provided by pension f unds and the price index for financial service charges, fees, and commission s.  More encouraging to  me is the fact that both the median CPI and the trimmed mean PCE show continued deceleration.  The fraction of components in the PCE registering price declines remains elevated and sustained.  According to our calculation, over the past 12 months the fraction of falling price components has averaged 40 percent compared with an average 32  percent from 1994 to September of 2008. Having said all of that, my outlook for economic growth has not changed.  I am not as pessimistic as the New York Fed appears to report—a number, by the way, which I note is strikingly close to what Goldma n Sachs is forecasting.  [Laughte r]  Nor is it as robust and optimistic as what the Board staff is projecting.  And given all that I’m seeing now, I stick to my previous forecast. I’m somewhere in between th e two, and having said that, I don’t think it is too early to begin to think of how we will delevera ge our balance sheet and pull back the monetary accommodation we have provided.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker. MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am  not sure I have ever seen President Dudley blush. [Laughter] Our information about the Fifth District economy has been somewhat mixed lately.  Surveys indicate th e service sector is looking up.  The nonretail revenue index has moved back toward positive terr itory—it’s not there yet—having been quite weak for several months. The retail revenue index has edged into  positive territory for the first time since the second quarter of 2007. Readings for employment in these two service sectors and expected demand six months ahead have also strengthen ed noticeably.  The ma nufacturing index has backed off its recent highs, however, and is hovering around the break-even mark.  Anecdotal comments suggest demand has stabilized in many firms after having recovered in the middle of the year, and exports are widely cited as a bright spot in the District.  Our survey measures of price trends remain stable at a low level. Nationally, at the last meeting I think most of us were expe cting national data to show a moderately paced recovery.  The intermeeting data ha ve generally been consistent with that or in some cases a bit better than expected, as many ha ve remarked.  Payroll employment losses have slowed substantially, and, as is typical in recove ries, there were strong upward revisions for prior months. Initial jobless claims have fallen more than 20 percent in the last six months, and the   63 of 247improvement in aggregate hours worked after so  many months of stagna tion was particularly useful. This stabilization in the labor market bolster s the outlook for consumer spending, I think.  Revisions that have added 1¼ pe rcentage points to the level of personal income cumulatively also bode well for consumption, and these developments make the recent growth in retail sales look more sustainable.  The recent firming in net exports and residential investment are also supporting domestic production.  The strong ISM manufacturi ng readings for production and new orders are consistent with recovery in the manufacturing sector.  Beca use the Fifth District manufacturing survey led the ISM on the way up, however, it led the much smaller Empire State survey and Philadelphia surveys as well; its rece nt decline might be a reason for caution about the robustness of manufacturing at  the national level.  Commerci al construction is obviously a drag on economic growth, but those figures have not come in no ticeably worse than expected, because expectations were so low to begin with.  So overall, I’m expecting moderate growth to continue along the lines of what’s in the Greenbook, but without as much disinflation. Having said that, I find it hard to get a bead on just how this  recovery is going to shape up over the next year or so. I sense a degree of caution am ong businesses attributable to concerns about the shif ting regulatory environment and potentia l health care and climate change legislation. Some of my colleagues around the table have remarked on that.  In addition, uncertainty about the future path of federal defi cits, I think, looms over th e outlook as well.  So economic growth might not accelerate much from here. In financial markets, rates on an array of short-term inst ruments have fallen since the example.  Meanwhile reserve balances have risen by more than $200 billion over the same period. This looks a lot like the quantitative easing we were expecti ng, and it may be partly  64 of 247responsible for the decline in other medium-term rates as well.  It’s not obvious that further easing was really needed over this  time frame, as the outlook has generally been improving.  The magnitude of the effect seems to have been rela tively small, however, and inflation expectations seem to have remained stable. The case for expecting further disinflation continues to weaken, in my view.  The Greenbook’s forecast for 2010 core PCE inflation was marked up yet again this time and has doubled since March.  The 2009 core forecast has been revised up since then as well, as core inflation has failed to fall as expected. It looks to me as if the stabili zing effect of inflation expectations has dominated any depressing e ffect coming from gaps between output and statistical trends in output, but I’m sure we will discuss this at greater length in our special topic tomorrow.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Evans. 

[SECTION]

MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On ce again, my outlook and business reports have not changed very much over the intermeeti ng period.  Most of my contacts currently are seeing continued modest improvement in their businesses, but firms continue to be nervous about prospects for the first half of 2010, and they’r e not making major new commitments right now.  That said, some are in the process of making marginal adjustments.  The temp firms said that they have now had three months of decent gains in orders, mostly for low-wage, light-industrial workers. Typically this is the first segment of their business to come back after a recession, and there were scattered reports from other contact s about some modest rehiring, though it is too early to see how meaningful these might be.  Largely, it is the bigge st cutters of employment that are rehiring right now. On balan ce, most reports indicate that businesses have largely completed the employment and capacity reductions associated  with right-sizing thei r operations for what   65 of 247they expect, and when signals poi nt more clearly to a sustaina ble upturn in the economy, they appear ready to make more definite commit ments to ramp up production.  By the way, no one raised the specter of uncertainty  over government legislation current ly being contemplated, but if I asked them later, and I did so metimes, they said yes, but it was not the first thing on their minds. Financial conditions seem to ha ve eased further in a number of  markets.  Risk aversion continues to decline, and there are increasing re ports of previously side lined capital moving in the markets in search of higher returns.  Not surprisingly, the chorus of concerns regarding frothiness in financial exuberan ce seems to be growing, and I think you heard about this in Berlin, according to news reports, Mr. Chairma n.  Although these warnings seem premature, a couple of them were interesting.  For example, my private equity director has noted several times that at least a few recent deals have included some of the troublesome features that we saw during the last boom:  interest rate toggles, light covenant pr ovisions, and funding for dividend recaps. In exuberant times, these lax provision s came bundled together.  In recent deals only single provisions have been included. Still, he sa ys he didn’t expect to se e any of these so soon.  In banking, however, there has been  no change in the ongoing complaints and debates.  Small businesses say credit is overly ti ght, while bankers worry about creditworthiness, managerial ability, and examiners’ reactions to new lending. This divergence between conditions in capital markets and bank credit serves as a reminder that monetary policy is a blunt tool .  Monetary accommodation will flow to where it can obtain the best return, and it is difficult to pr edict when it will reach particular sectors.  Currently the liquidity is going to capital market s, and while it is helping banks shore up their balance sheets, it is not clearly fi nding its way into new bank lending. 66 of 247Turning to the outlook, business and household caution and restrictiv e bank credit will continue to be headwinds, but I expect these to abate more as we move through next year.  Overall, my forecast for real economic activity is about unchanged from last round, and we are looking for GDP growth rates over  the next year and a half si milar to those in the Greenbook.  With regard to prices, resource slack remains larg e, and inflation trends are still well below my guideline of 2 percent. At the same time, infl ation expectations have remained within their recent ranges.  So my forecast for inflation is about the same as last round, with core PCE inflation flattened down a bit in 2010 to 2011 but  then moving up to about 1¾ percent in 2012.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Yellen. MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Sin ce the last meeting I’ve made relatively minor changes to my forecast for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation.  I expect the economy to grow only modestly over the next couple of years, with unemployment remaining inordinately high and inflation running below my preferred rate for a very long time.  Though I’m not satisfied with this outlook, my concerns about the downside ri sks going forward have continued to diminish since we met in Nove mber.  A wide range of indicators shows improvement: interest rates have come down and equity prices have risen; consumer spending has picked up; home sales have risen smartly; and the global recovery  has gained traction. The positive signs we have seen are welcom e, as economic activity has fallen so far below where it ought to be. There is, of course, some range of opinion on the extent of slack in the economy.  Some of my directors characterize it as very large.  Others insist it is so massive that we will end up with a lost  generation of people whose skills  and labor market attachment atrophy from disuse. In this context, the November employment report was clearly good news,    67 of 247and it now seems quite likely that employment gr owth will soon head into positive territory.  The workweek and temporary employment, both harb ingers of future job creation, have risen, although as David noted, the JOLTS data suggest that  hiring rates remain at  an exceptionally low level. It is sobering to realize, however, that we need an exte nded string of strong employment reports for unemployment to fall in line w ith the Greenbook projecti on.  In the Greenbook, nonfarm payroll gains average about 260,000 jobs per month over 2010 and 2011, and this is still enough only to lower the unemployment rate to a still elevated 8¼ per cent by the end of 2011.  As if the attainment of such gains weren’t enoug h of a challenge, we might need even larger job creation to bring the unemployment rate down under a reasonable altern ative to the Greenbook’s assumption about labor force participation.  The pa rticipation rate has fa llen about a percentage point since the recession began, and the Greenbook assumes that participation will fall a bit more. Historically, however, participation has been  strongly cyclical, and if over the next year the participation rate were to rebound by even half a percentage point, then we would need another 1.2 million jobs, 100,000 more per month, just to achieve the same slow decline in the unemployment rate. Last week I showed a forecas t much like the Greenbook’s to my  directors.  Frankly, they were incredulous. Every single one of them thought we were overly optimistic about employment.  My contacts are more likely to be  considering continued layoffs rather than any substantial hiring. Indeed, one of them said, “It’s become fashionable not to be hiring.”  Businesses think that for the foreseeable future they can continue to meet sales demands with productivity improvements.  For the foreseeable  future, their planning horizon appears very short. They remain shell-shocked and traumatized from recent events.  A couple of them  68 of 247emphasize that they’re making plans based on what they see over the next three to six months, since they have little confidence looking beyond  that horizon.  So, even though my contacts consistently see signs that dema nd is starting to recover, uncerta inty remains high.  They remain focused on ensuring their survival and are hesitant  to hire or invest be yond replacing essential equipment. For smaller businesses especially, financing conditions also remain an impediment to expansion. Credit is available, but nonprice terms, including colla teral requirements, are viewed as onerous and unattractive. This is yet anothe r reflection of the pervasive fear that businesses feel about making commitments that could come back to haunt them.  Moreover, even with the thawing we have seen in credit markets, events  during the crisis have made firms keenly aware that they can’t rely on financial ma rket functioning.  So at least some  of my contacts plan to keep more cash on their balance sheet permanently rather than deploying it. Of course, there are limits to the efficiency  improvements that have boosted the aggregate productivity figures so spectacularly, limits to  how much firms can expand production without adding employees or capital.  So when businesses become more confident about the future, they will eventually begin hiring in earnest and ramp up capital expenditures.  The question is how long it will be before this important elem ent of confidence retu rns to our economy. The high degree of slack in labo r markets is also making it harder to achieve what I view as a desirable inflation rate of 2 percent for core PCE prices.  We’ll talk much more about inflation dynamics later in this meeting, but one theme of the papers prepared for that discussion is how slack pushes down marginal cost, and we’ve cer tainly seen that in the data.  According to the employment cost index, compensation gain s this year have been anemic, running 2 percentage points or so below their pre-recessi on rates, and the strength in productivity has   69 of 247caused unit labor costs to fall markedly over the pa st year.  These disinflationary forces working through slack are at least partially offset by inflat ion expectations.  According to most available measures, inflationary expectations are reasonably stable at present. My staff regularly estimates a model that allows them to decompose the break-even inflation rate from TIPS into inflation expect ations and an inflation risk premium.  Their model-implied expectations for inflation have fl uctuated in a relativel y narrow range during the last six months, although they are down noticeably  at all horizons since the beginning of 2009.  Inflation risk premiums, in contra st, have risen since the beginning of the year and are now in the somewhat elevated range.  These estimates are co nsistent with the anecdotes we hear concerning the unusually large dispersion of opinion a bout the longer-term inflation outlook. All told, I agree with the Gr eenbook that the most likely outcome for prices is some further disinflation.  If this forecast proves ac curate, I would expect uncertainty about the inflation outlook to decline and th e inflation risk premium to reced e.  The bottom line is that we are faced with a situation in which inflation is  undesirably low, and, even with large monthly employment gains, the level of resource slack w ill remain high for an extended period.  In my forecast, the zero bound and the limits on unconven tional policy constrain us from pursuing a more desirable and more expansionary policy for some time to come.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig.

MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Give n the structural challenges that our economy is experiencing and has ahead of it, I’m relatively optimistic about the economy.  Rather than discussing the nationa l picture, because our District  mirrors some of the national events, I’ll focus on some of that information.   70 of 247First of all, we’re experiencing some impr ovement in our manufacturing sector.  It’s small but systematic, and we get fairly good report s back on our surveys.  Our retail sales reports are up across the District. This holiday season ha s been better than most people expected.  We are seeing some slowing down in job losses, as others have reporte d, certainly, across the region.  And even in our housing sector we are seeing mode st improvements there as well.  Our ag sector is actually improving very nicely, with improveme nts in the internationa l sales area, with goods sales to China, for example, and so our ag sector is really quite good ri ght now across the region.  Even technology seems positive.  As one of our contacts described it, compared with the tech bubble bust, this has been a very mild event for th em, so they’re much more optimistic as they go forward and think that they will have further strengthening moving from here. It’s interesting in talking with some of th ese individuals—it’s like listening to the FOMC.  They’re optimistic, they’re doing pr etty well, but they’re not quite  sure, so they’re holding back, waiting for more certainty before they invest. And they have a good pocket of money to invest once they gain that confidence to “pull the trigger,” if you will.  That was striking in a number of conversations I had with some of the tech peop le and some of the others who were thinking about investing going forward. I think that’s worth noting. As others have said, commercial real estate is really quite difficu lt for banks that are caught up in the commercial real estate cycle.  Bu t, for our region, I think it’s also important to make some distinctions.  In the urban areas, where some banks have plunged into commercial real estate, they’re in deep troub le, and they’re not going to be able to make loans.  They’re just hanging on. But there’s another gr oup of banks that did not plunge  as deeply, and it’s a fair percentage of our banks. They have kind of the same issue that I talked  about earlier—they have the money, but they want to be  very careful, they don’t want to get caught up in any false  71 of 247recovery, and so they are being very thoughtful before they extend it.  Even though they have funds, their standards are fairly  tight, and they’re also claimi ng they’re not seeing the demand from the small business, so they have both side s going.  But as the economy improves, I think a good number of them will be in a position to lend, even though there will continue to be a drag from the commercial real estate side. So overall I think we are on the right track.  Things are improving in our region, and I think I see that in the models on the national economy.  I have no major disagreements with the Greenbook, as we think about things going forward. I do want to note and make a comment on the issue that Jim Bullard mentioned.  I think that the approach of not reinvesting proceeds in the maturing MB S is a very good approach.  And I would tell you that, the way I l ook at it, even if you were to do that, in 2016 you’d still have half your portfolio left. But it’s like phase 1 of this ex traction process.  We talked earlier about raising the spread, letting thes e roll off, and then, depending on how the economy recovers, we might be more actively engaged in managing that portfolio down, if we’re permitted to do so, by circumstances, and we should be considering th at.  Part of that, hopefully, will be discussed tomorrow, and certainly a big part of that will be discussed in January. And I look forward to both of those conversations. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am pleased to see the signs of improvement in the economic data we received during the intermeeting pe riod, especially in the momentum and as challenged by a lack of business confidence.  My business contacts report that sales are up from earlier this ye ar, but they don’t see the momentum that is needed for a  72 of 247sustained recovery.  Several of my contacts noted that recent growth is unlikely to be sustained, because it was driven by one-time gains.  For ex ample, business has been picking up in several manufacturing industries, because they are replacing inventories at the wholesale level.  They indicated that wholesalers had not been restocking earlier in the year.  Inventory restocking is obviously welcomed, but if it is without a sust ained improvement in final demand, it implies only a temporary strengthening in economic activity. My business contacts also expressed a gene ral lack of confidence in the outlook. They view the current environment as so alien that most of them were uncomfortable providing an outlook for 2010. They tell me that their conven tional methods for assessing their own business prospects are irrelevant in this environment.  On top of the uncertainties about the economic outlook, as others have noted, pr oposals for health care reform, financial reform, and the new environmental regulations, have the potential to affect busines s conditions significantly in the near future. I am concerned that this lack of confidence in the economy’s prospects for even the next few quarters is going to be a sign ificant barrier to a more robust recovery.  Businesses continue to stress cash preservation and cost containment as their top priorities.  They report little incentive or motivation to invest  in capital projects.  To quote one CEO, “We’re not going to invest or prepare for growth wit hout orders in hand.”  This issue of confidence was also raised in a recent discussion at our joint board of directors meeting, among the businesspeople and the bankers, on credit availability  and bank lending standards. For large firms, which have access to the public  debt markets, credit is now available on more attractive terms than earlier this year.  But,  as others have commented, smaller firms, which rely primarily on banks, are complaining about the availability of credit .  Bankers expressed a 73 of 247lack of confidence in the values of their borrowers’ collateral as  one of the main reasons that they have had to raise their lending standards. Many of the businesspeople criticized the hi gher pricing and tighter terms for lending as being based on unreasonable assessments of their bus inesses.  So they are losing confidence in banks as a reliable source for funds in the face of elevated terms and additional covenants.  These reports suggest that credit availa bility continues to be  an impediment to growth, particularly if we are counting on small businesses to contribute to economic growth. My business contacts did have some good news, and that is that more firms are expecting to return to profitability.  With  this improvement, several businesses reported that they would at least partially restore hours, wa ges, and benefits that had been  cut when the outlook was more dire. These actions should aid GDP growth, even  if they have little effect on the unemployment rate for a while. More broa dly, the speed and scale of the cutbacks many businesses implemented earlier this year give firms substan tial room to expand activities before they would have to hire any new employees. Weighing all of these reports and the recen t data, I made only minor changes to my outlook. I continue to see weak er GDP growth in the current quarter and for 2010 than the Greenbook projection. I expect the unemploym ent rate to remain roughly unchanged in PCE inflation remains low throughout 2010 before  it gradually converges towards 2 percent beginning in 2011. My inflation outlook is based on the significant amount  of excess capacity that we currently have and infla tion expectations that remain clos e to 2 percent from one to ten years out, according to my staff’s model for inflation expectations.  74 of 247I continue to see the risks as balanced  around my outlook for economic growth and inflation. The potential for the recent momentum in labor markets to cont inue is roughly offset by the potential for further restraints on credit av ailability.  For inflation, uncertainty remains elevated on either side of my projection.  This uncertainty is linked closely to whether or not inflation expectations remain an chored.  Overall, the economy is certainly in better shape than earlier this year, but it is still not clear to me that the economy ha s truly turned the corner.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairm an.  In the Ninth District, real economic activity has begun to recover, but slowl y.  The basic sense among our directors and our Small Business Council is that the deterioration in conditions has ended.  Figures confirm this sense. Regional unemployment has stabilized, although at elevated levels.  However, our directors also expressed some skepticism about  the degree to which this turnaround can be sustained without ongoing government interventions , such as the first-time homebuyer credit.  Our Small Business Council expressed strong concer ns about policy uncertainty related to taxes, health care, and cap and trade. Nationally, the revised estimate of third qua rter GDP growth was 2.8 percent.  This increase is better than the preceding four quarter s of negative growth.  Nonetheless, output is well below its trend level if we assume that that  trend grows at 3 percen t per year, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007.  The Greenbook predicts that GDP will rise by over 4 percent per year over the next two years.  Based on our Minneapolis model’s forecast, I believe that this prediction is somewhat optimistic.  But even if the Greenbook were right, GDP will be well below this 3 percent trend line through the end of 2011.   75 of 247In terms of labor market conditions, the N ovember employment report was heartening.  National unemployment has started to decline,  and employment seemed to stabilize in agree with the Greenbook that it will remain  elevated through 2011.  The employment-to­population ratio remains at a 25-year low. The inflation front is more promising.  Infla tion remains low.  Inflationary expectations, as measured by Blue Chip forecasts or TIPS spread s, also remain low.  My own expectations are similar.  Nonetheless, I am concerned about a tail risk of a low-probability but high-inflation outcome.  The size of the government debt held in the private sector has increased by more than 30 percent in the past two years.  This rise in th e debt can only be funded by future tax increases, spending cuts, or higher inflation.  Any uncertain ty about the Congress’s will to exercise the required fiscal restraint translat es directly into uncertainty ab out current or future inflation. There is also good news in financial markets.  Thanks in large part to interventions by the Fed, key liquidity measures like TED spreads ha ve returned to normal.  Indeed, the option-adjusted spread between agency MBS and Treasurie s has fallen to near hi storical lows.  This improvement in financial markets has significant consequences for policy.  Liquidity disruptions last fall served to segment financial markets in unprecedented ways.  In that environment, the LSAP played a valuable role by lowering risk pr emiums in the agency debt and MBS markets.  However, the return to normalcy in spreads across financial markets i ndicates the degree of would, at a minimum, be supportive of not reinve sting the proceeds from the LSAP either from the agency securities or from the Treasury debt. 76 of 247Overall, the real side of the economy is r ecovering somewhat.  However, detrended GDP is well below historical norms, and unemployment is well above the historical norms.  And this characterization seems likely to continue we ll into 2011.  Inflation is under control and is expected to remain so, although th e size of the government debt re presents a possible large risk.  Financial markets continue to improve and are much stronger than a year ago.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic outlook has clearly improved since the previous  meeting, and we all seem to agree on that.  On the real activity side, here’s what strikes me as most meaningful:  First is a more solid foundation for consumer spending, as David Wilcox pointed ou t—a higher underlying compensation trend, as well as slower job losses and rising hours worked last month.  Second is consumer spending gains—core retail sales in November were quite solid, for example, and real consumer spending looks likely to grow at a moderate rate this qu arter.  Third, as Nathan pointed out, is trade improvement fueled by export growth, not just export growth on its own, but also supported by pretty strong economic expansion outside the U.S.  And, fourth is  something that hasn’t been mentioned yet—it looks as if some of the TARP monies are going to be used to fund a modest jobs program, so the trajectory of fiscal stimul us may not be as steeply downward as we go through 2010 as we anticipated earlier. But I don’t want to put too much weight on any of this.  First, I think much of this improvement was anticipated.  I think it’s more  that we’re moving al ong the path that we expected, rather than we are moving to a distin ctly better path.  Sec ond, there are significant constraints in terms of credit av ailability, and I don’t see any sign that those have changed very 77 of 247much since the last meeting.  Third, we still have a tremendous amount of political uncertainty about health care reform, financial reform, and tax policy.  In talki ng to our directors, they make it very clear that this is a f actor influencing their hiring beha vior.  Although job losses have slowed, this seems to be almost exclusively due to much slower layoffs than due to a pickup in hiring. So for the New York Fed, Richard, the bottom line is more confidence about the sustainability of the recovery, but still an expe ctation that the economy w ill slow a bit from the current pace in 2010. That said, I think the risks to our forecast  are shifting towards the upside from the downside. We should also recognize that we face a very disappointing path for unemployment going forward. So even if the economy is on a somewh at stronger growth path, that would be very welcome right now, and I would argue we should not  offset that with ch anges in our policy. On the inflation side, I think the outlook has not changed much.  We have TIPS five-year, five-year forward inflation measures—it may in fact be slightly higher than that, but it’s hard to know because the inflation risk premiums are ha rd to extract.  And some other indicators certainly show less anxiety about  the inflation outlook.  For exam ple, the fears about commodity prices and the dollar seem to ha ve calmed down quite a bit since the last meeting.  Interestingly, the mid-month University of Michigan reading ha d an almost bizarre drop in the median one-year and five-year inflation forecast—maybe it was just a fluke, but it was interesting nevertheless. Given the large amount of federal borrowi ng and the imminent wind-up of our large-scale asset-purchase program, I am, frankly, qui te surprised that long-term rates have not climbed more sharply.  And I take that as anothe r sign that investors are either not that worried  78 of 247about the long-term fiscal outlook or particularly worried about the risk of higher inflation.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We ha ve had several encouraging signs about the strength and sustainability of the recovery, not enough to wa rrant a major change in the outlook, but we’re moving in the right direction.  My list is the same as the list that everyone else has read out. So, very briefly, private demand has been stronger, especially in consumption, supported by more income growth.  Business sp ending on capital equipment does seem to be moving a little higher. Growth is beginning to feed through to reduced job loss and higher hours, and financial conditions are improving in markets, with declines in bond rates, increases in stock prices, and securities markets are open to substantial capital-rais ing, albeit at still somewhat elevated risk premiums.  Foreign growth is a bi t stronger on balance, so the pickup is global, it’s not idiosyncratic to the U.S., a nd it should support export growth. I think there are a couple of po ssible reasons for a slightly st ronger outlook.  Some of it is pent-up demand perhaps.  The level of spending on consumer durables and capital equipment has been below replacement levels, al though, in my view, the stock of  consumer durables and capital was probably above long-term sustainable leve ls coming into the re cession, reflecting an unsustainable level of consumption and investment; but wear and technological improvements are making updating and replacement more a ttractive for households and businesses. With the return of risk appetite in financia l markets, financial constraints may be a little less binding than we expected, at least for t hose with access to securi ties markets where low policy interest rates are feeding through the cost of capital.  And markets are opening up to more securitization in selected segments, pa rtly through the in fluence of TALF.    79 of 247Capital reflows to emerging markets, along with  expansionary fiscal  policies abroad, are lifting asset prices and supporting income growth, especially in emerging Asia.  Still, in my view, incoming information has also tended to co nfirm the existence of several constraints on spending that are likely to keep the improvement in the economy gradual and the decline in the unemployment rate quite slow. The contribution of the rebound in housing will  be much more limited than usual in a recovery, and the information we’ve gotten since the last meeti ng confirmed that starts and permits for single-family homes over recent mont hs have been quite flat, and for multifamilies they’ve dropped quite substantia lly.  Prices of homes have m oved down again, at least by one measure, and oncoming foreclosures are likely to limit any gains in prices.  And the vacancy rate is still quite high, indicating that  there are plenty of existing ho mes available to meet demand and constrain new building. As many have remarked, bank credit remains qu ite tight, and growth in the money supply has been modest.  To date, there’s little evidence that the huge quantity of reserves is materially affecting the supply of money and bank credit.  Spreads on business loans from banks widened further over the past three months.  Small busines ses perceive credit availability to be quite limited.  Credit card rates have risen substantially ; that’s partly in anticipation of regulatory pricing constraints, but it does raise the cost of  capital of households and small businesses.  And bank loans have continued to drop very, very rapidly. Many foreign economies may be constrained in the degree to which they will support faster global growth. Japan seems to be fightin g against a strengthening deflationary trend amid enough concerns about the economic outlook there to foster additional stimulus from both the fiscal and monetary authorities.  I thought the staff forecast for Japan was on the optimistic side.    80 of 247The euro area is threatened by sovereign debt cr ises across its southern tier and in Ireland, which at a minimum will necessitate a severe tightening of fiscal policies in many countries.  And it’s not clear how long emerging Asia can carry the world economy without exacerbating imbalances and worries about excessive cr edit creation and asset bubbles. To be sure, the repeated modest upside surp rises to activity over the summer and fall do suggest some upside risk to the forecast.  It c ould be that confidence is  gradually rebuilding, and there’s a positive interaction with the financial ma rkets that could gather steam.  But there are downside risks as well. We are removing a s ubstantial number of governmental props to the financial markets and the economy over the next several quarters.  The mortgage market is a particular concern as we stop our  MBS purchases.  The U.S. Treasury will be constrained in its backstop of the GSEs after yea r-end, and there will be no clarity on the ultimate fate of these agencies for some time, probably a year or more.  And some areas of securitization appear to be less ready to stand on their own than others, suggesting that so me borrowers will face higher costs as TALF is terminated.  Additionally, the substantial support that fiscal policy has provided to spending will be winding down in the second half of next year, and questions about fiscal sustainability will constrain any new s timulus now or if the economy falters. In an environment of high unemployment a nd excess capital capacity, I expect intense competition among workers and businesses to ke ep costs low and the underlying trend of inflation stable at a low rate, that is, a rate  below my objective and/or perhaps even trending lower. And I think the data on price moveme nts that we have gotte n over the intermeeting period broadly support this outlook .  Energy prices have lifted  headline inflation in recent months, but oil prices have fallen considerably in recent weeks.  Import prices have also added some to inflation, but the most recent stabilizatio n of the dollar should lim it the extent of those 81 of 247effects. Core CPI increases have been relativel y flat at a fairly low 1¾ percent on balance over the past six months. Core PCE has picked up a b it, but that reflects non market prices.  Market-based core PCE has continued to go lower to ar ound 1¼ percent.  The trend in unit labor costs remains downward, reflecting both strong productivity increases and damped compensation.  And there are some hints in the survey data that  long-term inflation expectations may be moving down a little, although it’s too early to make anything of thos e surveys, and the market-based measures of long-term expectations remain at the top of recent ranges.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh. MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me spend most of my time on financial yours. At the last couple of FOMC meetings I,  like several of you, argued that the next few quarters were going to be considerab ly stronger than the next few y ears.  I think we finally have some data that bear that out.  First, the rema rkable melting up in credit and financial markets, which we have all been noting for quite some time, seems to be doing remarkable things to help get this economy going over the near term.  Sec ond, is the jobs front, which President Yellen and many of you talked about.  I thi nk the job creation story is both a function of near-term prospects and medium-term prospects, and if  medium-term prospects are as uncertain as many of us have described, then we should not be so surprised that the job engine is—“effectively dead” perhaps overstates—effectively impaired for some time. While it’s difficult not to see some good news in the most recent labor market prints and unemployment prints, let me try.  Firings have  certainly leveled out, but I do think what’s happening on the small business stuff is more th an just politicians approaching even-numbered   82 of 247years—it does appear to be much  more substantial than that.  And the probability, as President Yellen said, that workers who lose jobs will spend more time out of work and the harm that could be doing to a generation of underemployed workers early in their careers strikes me as something that could well be structural and a cause for real concern. I remain concerned about other possible out comes to the real economy in late 2010 and beyond. While the productiv ity surge has been more impressive than I thought it would be, it’s hard to know how much of these improvements are cyclical and how much of them are structural and enduring. Historically, early-stage spurts  in productivity have been followed by rising unemployment, but maybe this time it’s different .  Maybe, amid the range of uncertainties, employment and even hours worked may be slow er to rebound, which could extend the period of strong productivity gains and productivity-driven growth without doing much to make us feel much better about the la bor market situation. On the financial market side, let me make re ference to three themes.  At the last FOMC meeting, I think, we discussed the fact that the fi nancial markets seem to be nearing an important inflection point with some real possible impact s on the broad economy.  So key theme number one: Is Dubai really about Dubai, and Greece re ally about Greece?  I th ink there are dozens of Dubais out there, that is, entities with the imp licit support of their sovereigns, and I think the relevant question is: Are the expected consolidat ed debt-to-GDP ratios consistent or inconsistent with current funding costs?  Ma rkets for now seem to be larg ely comfortable with sovereign credits generally and with sovere ign support of off-balance-sheet li abilities.  Think of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, think of the EU and Greece, and ther e are very few spillovers across markets.  CDS for some of the sovereigns, as Brian mentioned at the outset, seem to be moving a bit, but I think we should be extremely worried about some nonlinea r moves.  So I am skeptical that the current 83 of 247comfort in financial markets will hold.  Bond market prices globally may be masking disturbing trends, and, while the official  statistics on government debt-to-GDP ratios and associated measures of liabilities are growing, if we added these implicit liabilities, the numbers really could be quite staggering. Think about the U.S. circumstance.  If we a dded the liabilities of Fannie and Freddie to the debt-to-GDP ratio here, our sovereign debt -to-GDP would double overnight.  Then if you go out into the medium term, the numbers become even more alarming.  I don’t mean to take us back to the early days of the panic, but what if  markets come to think of these off-balance-sheet liabilities as the SIVs off-balance-sheet entities, bu t this time of the official sector?  The average terms of many sovereigns’ fundi ng, including our Treasury, have shortened throughout much of 2009, and the problems of maturity mismatch are not unique to the private sector or unique to the U.S. government.  So I wonder whether governme nts are properly gaugi ng their true medium-term costs of funding; and if complacency is, in fact, finding its way into financial markets, we cannot discount the prospect of some of these nonlinear outcomes in the financial markets, which would certainly do great harm to the economy. Key theme number two, old money chasing old products.  So what’s th at reference?  It looks to me as though what we are seeing in a sset allocation is fund flows coming out of the money market and money market mutual funds and other assets that are yielding close to nothing, investors that are tired of earning zero as they see markets melting up around them, and they are investing that in assets.  But most of these assets are not new assets.  There’s not a tremendous supply of new issuance coming to mark et—frankly, there’s less new supply than I would have thought. Brian talked about the ne w supply of mortgage-bac ked securities being relatively scant.  I think that is true across a rang e of markets.  In some ways, we are seeing older 84 of 247vintages of assets getting bid up.  If I compare the refrains from the recent boom in asset prices with current conditions, we can all remember a couple of years ago folks showing up and saying, “I have got $3,000 to pay for my mortgage paym ent this month.  How much house can I get?”  The 2009–2010 version of that is an investor sh owing up and saying, “I need LIBOR plus 400.  What am I buying today?” So I w ould prefer, in general, to be  seeing new money evaluating new products rather than old money ch asing old products, but I think that’s a sense of where we are. But all my themes aren’t negative.  So let me leave with a final positive theme in financial markets.  As Brian said  at the outset, we have seen a couple of differing moves both in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and in commodity prices.  We saw this one-way bet on dollar and commodity prices, a weaker dollar, higher gold, higher metals, for much of the intermeeting period, but it has revers ed over the course of the last ten days or so.  I happen to think that reversal is healthy.  I happen to think that a two-way market across these key asset classes is probably a good thing. A stronger dolla r, commodities a bit weaker in the last ten days, and reaction to recent st ronger data in the U.S. on payr olls and consumer spending, and more worries about European prospects tell me th ese markets are acting a little bit more as we had long thought they would.  They seem somewhat  healthier in responding to relative growth rates and expectations of relati ve rate differentials, with the U.S., frankly, standing up relatively favorably against the U.K. and the European Un ion.  Before the last 10 days, many of these commodities were near multidecade highs.  Risks of one-way bets and even bubble conditions in certain assets, as a result, may be mitigated if what we’re seeing is something more than a head fake. I think those trends on the dollar and comm odities are important to  watch.  I think they likely offer an important view on what happens to inflation expectati ons going forward.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  85 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Duke.

MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In gene ral, the bankers are looking for some sign of the top in their credit deterioration, and, with the exception of CRE, everybody seems to feel like it is just around the corner, that they are very cl ose, but nobody can support it yet with any real evidence. They expect that the nonpe rformers will peak in 2010 and charge-offs will peak in late 2010 or early 2011. Every banker I spoke with—probably because th ey were just coming out of or still wrestling with their 2010 profit planning—was focu sed on the need to find loans in order to generate income.  They said th at the loans that th ey’re currently booking are of high quality.  Pricing actually has gone from be ing great to being simply good.  There’s widespread use of interest rate floors, and they’re beginning to se e some competition both in rates and in terms.  Most are reluctant to add any mortgage-backed s ecurities to their invest ment portfolios because they’re afraid of what happens when we stop buyi ng or when we sell.  And a number of them are actually harvesting gains in their existing portfolio, because those gains are a significant part of their capital and they need to lock them up. Tr ansaction volume is shifting heavily from credit cards to debit cards, and total transaction vol ume is up, while the average ticket is down, indicating that consumers are spen ding from money that they have rather than money that they’re borrowing. On the regulatory front, a number of them re ported examiners not willing to follow the new CRE guidance. The reports to me were all about FDIC and OCC examiners, and they’re singularly unwilling to use any appeals process or ombudsman to talk about this with those regulators. None of them mentioned Federal Rese rve examiners, and we c ould assume from that that there were no Federal Reserve examiners who were unwilling to follow the guidance, but I   86 of 247think it would probably be better if we were vigilant with our own troops  as well.  On the new overdraft rules, I talked to one bank that has estimated a 15 to 20 percent hit to earnings per share and has calculated that in the past the cost of  providing checking accounts  has been increasingly covered by overdraft fees, which led to a proliferation of free checki ng.  In order to  reverse this to accommodate the new overdraft rules, the br eakeven for checking accounts is likely to be somewhere around $10 per month per account. I’ve been struck by the sharp decline in cost and the increase in availability of credit in the debt markets while the opposite seems to be happening in credit prov ided through banks.  So I took a look at loan vo lumes and found a very different story for the large versus the small banks. The larger banks typically have mortga ge, credit card, large business, middle-market lending. The top 25 banks have 70 percent of the C&I loans, 73 percent of the mortgages, and 80 percent of the card debt.  They have made extensive use of Fed facilities, Federal Home Loan Bank, and FDIC guaranteed debt, and they ’re much further along in emerging from the financial crisis. They do have access to capital markets and have repaid or are planning to repay their TARP. In contrast, the problems for small banks starte d later and are still bui lding.  They have big construction and CRE portfolios. In fact, 60 percent of the total CRE loans outstanding are in the smaller banks.  They have 30 percen t of the C&I loans, although those loans are predominantly to small businesses.  They fund through deposits, Federal Home Loan Banks, CDARS, and brokered deposits.  They have limit ed access to capital, and many of those who did not get TARP, either because they were not allowe d to or because they elected not to, now wish they had it as they work through this  CRE cycle and are finding problems.  87 of 247Given the sharp reduction in bank lending, I took a look at lo an balances in the third quarter of 2009 compared with year-end 2007.  While banks of all sizes have reduced loans, the big reduction has been in the top 20 banks that are just below the top five. For the top five, loans are down just under 2 percent. Fo r the next 20, loans are down more  than 10 percent, and for all others, loans are down about 2½ percent. So there’ s a real concentration in  those 20.  Inside of commercial real estate, the constr uction land development, where th e portfolios have been hit the hardest, are down 25 percent in banks below the top five, while loans on existing nonresidential real estate are actually  up across the board. Finally, I decided to focus on the two politica lly hot categories, mortgage modifications and small business.  To size the mortgage m odification problem, 5.7 million mortgages are now 60 days past due with 2.3 million in the process of foreclosure, roughly equivalent to a year’s sales of existing homes.  I talked to one large lender servicer who was able to give me some breakdown in the HAMP. He said 20 percent ar e not owner-occupied, 20 percent have less than 31 percent DTI, and 20 percent don’t qualify for other reasons; 10 percen t are underemployed or unemployed.  Of the remaining 30 percent, half don’t accept the offer.  Banks were encouraged to get the numbers up by putting people in tr ial modifications and then gathering the documentation during the trial peri od.  Of those who have made their payments, one-third have submitted all of their documents, one-third have presented partial documents, and one-third have submitted no documents. The banks are still modifying many loans out side of HAMP, but the loans previously modified are re-defaulting, and rising unemployment is working agai nst them.  The clock is still ticking. Banks are now formalizing and streamlining short-sale processes and investing in staffing systems and training, but we’re still likely  to see three to four million foreclosures.     88 of 247However, they will be spaced out over two to thre e years due to all of the foreclosure prevention efforts, the timing of re-defaults, judicial foreclosure processes,  and staffing issues. On the new loan front, Fannie Mae has now raised cutoff FICO scores for even 80 percent mortgages, which would potentially affect as many as 30 million borrowers.  The FHA is studying both FICO and downpayment requiremen ts.  So even in the government-supported space, term tightening continues. Turning to small business lending, in the NFIB  survey, 15 percent said credit was more difficult to obtain, which compares with a 12 percent level in 1990.  But only 5 percent ranked credit as their most important problem—it is well  behind weak sales at 33 percent, taxes at 20 percent, government regulations and red tape at 13 percent, and even the co st and availability of insurance at 8 percent. Our data on small businesses was last done in 2003, but at that point we estimated that only 1 percent of small business borrowing comes from the SBA.  With the SBA, the expanded loan guarantee program is now out of money.  Ch anges were made to increase the guarantee to 90 percent with a maximum loan size of 1½ percent and allow refi nancing of existing credit.  There is a House bill that would extend the program and increase loan sizes.  As you might expect, commercial banks are the primary providers  of credit, supplying tw o-thirds of the total credit, but, of that, approximately 40 percent are borrowed under a commercial mortgage.  The smaller banks usually underwrite them individua lly, but they take some form of collateral, preferably real estate, to compensate for less re liable financial statements, the mixing of personal and business assets, and low capitalization. So I would estimate that at least half of the commercial real estate and more than 90 percent of the C&I loans in the smaller banks are small business loans. Larger banks are underwriting centrally using credit-s coring models and moving   89 of 247to limit local overrides.  They’re reporting losses similar to unsecured consumer credit, and the larger credit card issuers have now  designed business card products to work like a traditional line of credit, but they’re concerned about the prospect of bus iness lines coming under the same restrictions as consumer credit. We hear so much about businesses failing due to  lack of credit.  I tr ied to find data on the rate of business failure. One bank had researched  its own experience and found, to its surprise, that the rate of business failure was not substantially different from earlier cycles.  They have hypothesized that low rates have allowed businesses to hang on longer.  So the small business job formation problem appears likely to be a new business formation, with new businesses usually funded with personal borrowing and funds  from family and friends rather than bank credit. Given widespread balance sheet impairme nt, I suspect new business formation to be quite low. While SBA programs might help on the marg in, I concluded that the best assistance for small businesses comes from low interest rates,  enforcement of CRE guidelines, and improving consumer wealth.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  Governor Tarullo. 

[SECTION]

MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me first say I know how pleased everyone must be that we are getting through th e go-round this afternoon so that we will have plenty of time tomorrow for our special, though regrettably untelevised, version of “Who Wants to Be an Inflation Fighter.” [La ughter]  I have read the transcript. Developments since our previous meeting ha ve obviously been positive, on balance, though not uniformly so.  The late-year improve ment probably reduces somewhat further the likelihood of what I have previously  characterized as a relapse scenar io.  But even if this modest trend continues through December, I don’t think a stronger than expect ed fourth quarter     90 of 247fundamentally changes the outlook for 2010.  In this  regard, there remains the important question whether or, more precisely, how much self-susta ining demand will fill in behind the withdrawal of stimulus over the course of next year.  For th e reasons many of us have  rehearsed at previous meetings, and that some of you have repeated this  afternoon, the answer to this question is quite uncertain. One area that unfortunately l ooks all too certain is unemployment.  Even the most optimistic of private forecasters believe that unemployment will remain at very elevated levels throughout next year. Quite apart from the social and longer-term economic damage that may be effected by prolonged high unemployment, my intuit ion continues to be that a level of 9 or 10 percent places a significant limit on the grow th of personal consumption expenditures unless one expects that compensation levels  will themselves rise steadily. Obviously then the contribution of wealth effects would be important for a sustained acceleration in consumption, as, in fact, we see reflected in the forecasts of those who do anticipate stronger PCE growth. He re again, though, there is consid erable uncertainty.  Indeed, I have noted that even those who sit together on the more optimistic e nd of the spectrum of forecasts for 2010 disagree on whether housing or equi ties will be the key driver of rising wealth. As to housing, at least, while I can tell the st ory of reduced inventor ies, lower prices, and less new home construction moving residential real estate eventually in a positive direction, I can equally conceive of such factors as more fo reclosures associated with unemployment and a possible jump in mortgage rates associated wi th the end of our MBS purchases leading to stagnant or even slightly  declining home prices. To be fair, I should also not e that some on the more pess imistic end of the 2010 spectrum have been a bit undone by the revisions to 2009 data  that revealed a highe r saving rate than had  91 of 247previously been assumed, thereby undermining the argument that saving will inevitably jump a good deal next year with conse quent negative effects on PCE. But this example makes my point as readily as the cloudiness around the more upbeat commentaries. We are still learning exactly how the different charac teristics of a deep, financially induced recession might confound exp ectations developed through experience with each of the recessions in the last 60 years, whethe r mild, moderate, or severe.  We will not have the luxury of waiting to see all these differences  unfold as we make our policy decisions.  We will necessarily be navigating in somewhat uncharted  waters, but to this point, I believe we have yet to see a credibly st rong current flowing by us. My basic outlook is thus essentially uncha nged from November, despite the noteworthy developments since that time.  Near-term pros pects remain moderately positive, with the important major  qualification of employment.  As to  the second half of 2010 and beyond, a forecast of incrementally to moderately above tre nd growth remains the best bet, but I continue to see significant, though reduced, downside ri sks and growing, though still modest, upside risks as well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. I know you’re all expecting a crisp, linear summary of the go-round, but I see that it’s past  5:30 [laughter], so why don’t we adjourn for a reception and dinner, and we’ll see you the first thing in the morning at 9:00 a.m.?  Thank you. [Meeting recessed]                                                        2 The materials used by Mr. Wascher are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). 92 of 247December 16, 2009—Morning Session Meeting attendees greeted Chairman Bernanke with a standing ovation when he entered the meeting room in recognition of his being named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year 2009.

MR. WARSH.  A little extra pressure for your pithy summary of yesterday’s discussion.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We want  to start today with Bill Wascher, who will give us some updates on data. 

[SECTION]

MR. WASCHER.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We received two data releases this morning—housing starts and the CPI—and you should have in front of you a three-page handout that summarizes the data.  The first page su mmarizes the housing star ts data, and you can see from the top line that total starts moved up to an annual rate of 574,000 units in November, with increases in starts of both single-family and multifamily units.  The jump in multifamily starts, which is about halfway down the table, basically re verses a sharp dip in Oc tober, and that was in line with our expectations.  While single-family starts also increased, that increase was smaller than we were expecting. Permits, which are a better underlying measure of starts, increased more than starts in November. But the comb ination of the permits and starts figures in for single-family starts is probably too optimistic.  While I would still think that a gradual improvement in new home sales will lead to a mo re noticeable pickup in the pace of starts next year, these data suggest that the upturn is laggi ng a little bit more than we were projecting.  The implications of these data for GDP are mainly fo r the first quarter, give n the lag between starts and construction; these data, and our reaction to them, would probabl y take off a tenth or two of a percentage point from our forecast for GDP growth in the first quarter. The next page summarizes the data for the CPI.  The total CPI rose 0.4 percent in rose a larger-than-expected 4.1 percent last m onth, while core prices were about unchanged in increase in the core index of about 0.1 percent.  The softness wa s concentrated in prices of services, especially in re nts.  In contrast, core goods prices  rose 0.2 of a percent in November, with noticeable increases in tobacco prices and in motor vehicle prices. It looks as if yesterday’s PPI release and today’s CPI release,  taken together, will imply a lower estimate of core PCE inflation in both the fourth quarter and the fi rst quarter than we had  93 of 247in the Greenbook. In particular, it looks as if we’ll be down from 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter in the Greenbook to 1.2 perc ent for core PCE price inflati on, and in the first quarter down from 1.3 percent to 1.1 percent.  For the total PCE price index, we would re vise our estimate for the fourth quarter from 2.8 percent to 2.6 percen t; for the first quarter, because of the higher energy prices, we would still be at 1.1 percent. Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Any questions for Bill?  [No response.] Okay. I did have overnight to put together my pithy su mmary, so let me just try to summarize what I thought was a good discussion yesterday. Economic indicators since the last meeting were generally a bit more positive than expected. Participants cited the November labor report, reta il sales, trade data, housing, and financial developments as positive.  Global econo mic growth is picking u p, more so in emerging risks to growth may be a bit smaller, most particip ants were not ready to re vise their expectations substantially for 2010 from prev ious projections of moderate  growth and continued high unemployment.  Anecdotes repeatedly cited unce rtainties on the part of  business leaders about both near-term and medium-term prospects, refl ecting questions about the economy itself and a range of government policies, including fis cal, climate, regulatory, and others.  These uncertainties, which are shared by the meeting participants, seem likely to retard new investment and hiring for some time.  Participants also debated whether private final demand will be sustained as government supports are withdrawn.  Housing provides  an example.  Although there have been some significant improvements, these may not continue next year as the Fed stops buying MBS, the GSEs reduce thei r portfolios and tight en terms, the first-time homebuyer tax credit ends, and slow progress in mortgage m odification fails to prevent another wave of foreclosures and distressed sale s.  On the inflation front, pr ice changes seem reasonably well   94 of 247controlled, with some expecting further moderation, es pecially in core infla tion, but others citing possible medium-term risks.   Looking at a bit more detail, recent data on consumer spending were encouraging, as noted. Income and saving this year were stronger  than initially estimated.  Household wealth is increasing, and sentiment has recently improved some.  Evidence on Christmas buying is mixed.  Consumers appear to be aggressive in limiting ticket sizes and pursuing discounts.  Households were likely encouraged by somewhat better  news about the labor market, but high unemployment seems likely to cap growth  in consumer confidence and spending. In the labor market, elements of good news  besides reduced job loss included increased hours, reduced unemployment claims, and more te mporary hires.  However, although job losses have moderated, firms remain quite reluctant to hire, and conditions overall remain very weak.  Extended high unemployment, which seems likely if  growth is not much above trend, could leave lasting scars on the labor force. As also noted, CEOs remain cautious.  Larg e firms have good access to credit, but are holding lots of cash rather than hiring and investing.  Smaller bank-dependent firms find credit much more difficult to obtain, although there was some difference of view as to whether these constraints would prevent small firms from expanding when demand picks up.  Productivity gains have been significant, as firms have cu t costs or looked to m eet demand without adding workers. Certain segments are performing be tter, including some manufacturing businesses, high tech, and agriculture, a nd shippers have seen an uptick in their business. Financial markets continue to improve, although  the risk of relapse cannot be ignored.  Some markets, such as securitiz ation markets, are still not f unctioning well.  Generally, asset values do not seem out of line with fundamentals, although as investors have become less   95 of 247cautious they may have also become less disc riminating.  Market sentiment has been strong enough to overcome setbacks, like the Dubai episode , but this episode may be indicative of the vulnerability of sovereign credit s.  Banks are raising capital a nd in some cases paying back the TARP. Bank credit, however, continues to cont ract, reflecting lack of demand, weak borrower quality, the risky macro environment, and bank concerns about their own capital positions.  Some banks complain about overzealous examiner s.  Banks are looking fo r credit losses to top out in 2010, except in commercial re al estate.  Large and small banks have different portfolio mixes, with small banks particularly vulnerable to the worsening CRE problem, and many are still likely to fail.  Small banks are also more likely to be lenders to small businesses. Inflation seems reasonably controlled.  Core  inflation seems to be moderating, though the underlying trend is not entirely clear, not only because of some energy pass-through but also some special factors, including an  increase in the pri ces of nonmarket components.  The median CPI and trimmed mean PCE inflat ion are flat to down.  Anecdot es suggest that firms have limited ability to raise prices in most cases.  Compensation figures we re revised up, but wage growth in general still appears quite moderate, and unit labor costs are further reduced by strong productivity; that is, in terms of the models, marginal costs do not seem to be rising quickly.  Inflation expectations are broadly stable, though inflati on risk premiums increase the difficulty of extracting these expectations from TIPS. As has been the case, views around the table differed on the size of the output gap and its relevance to infla tion determination.  Energy price increases and declines in the dollar have recently reversed. Medium-term risks, other than the Fed’s balance sheet, include the U.S. fiscal situation and import costs.  We discussed the structur e of the Fed’s policy regime, including exit-sequencing and the development and communication of a policy rule.  That’s my overview of  96 of 247what I heard. Obviously, there’s diversit y among the group.  Are there any comments or questions? [No response.] As always, it’s very difficult to add intellig ent new and insightful ideas after all of you have already spoken, but let me just say a c ouple things.  First, lik e everybody else, I was heartened by the intermeeting data, and I think I ma y have taken just a bit more signal than some of you from it.  In particular, even though the overall economic growth in the second half was not much changed by the revised data, the contou r was changed.  The third quarter was weaker, the fourth quarter looks to be re latively strong, perhaps 4 percent or more, and so there is a sense of somewhat more momentum going into 2010. At the same time, we saw developments, particularly in the consumer sector, which are a bit encouraging towards the view  that, as inventory adjustments follow through and as other temporary factors weaken, final demand will be able to pick up and continue the moderate recovery that we anticipate in 2010. So, like most of you, I haven’t significantly revised my modal forecast, but I do have somewhat more confidence that the momentum will be sustained into Looking specifically at th e consumer, a number of  things were encouraging.  I think the simple fact that there was more demand for housing and autos is actually encouraging, not just in terms of total spending dollars but also because  the willingness of c onsumers to commit to longer-term durable goods is in itself an indication of greater c onfidence in their own income and the future of the economy.  And, more generally, we did see improved attitudes as measured, for example, with the Michigan survey.  Although—l et’s be careful—they’re still very low in historical terms, and though the current conditions index improved considerably, the expected conditions measure didn’t do very much.  So we are seeing some improvement there, but, again, we should be cautious.      97 of 247On consumer fundamentals, we have seen the upgrade of income, which, as some have noted, helps explain how you can consume more and save more at the same time—[laughter]— which has been happening.  And there are some positive developments, for example, in energy prices, which will help real income; in inflation expectations, which help expected real income; and in wealth. On the latter, as we saw in the fl ow of funds data, about a third of the losses have been reversed so far, so there is some continue d improvement on that front.  That’s all positive, and it gives us more sense that the cons umer will not fade as the handoff happens. On the labor market, I think we can find a few positive elements.  We’ve noted a number of things from the labor market report.  I thi nk, more generally, there ar e some indications that the recovery will not be as “jobless” as it was in  the last two recessions, given the depth of the productivity gains we’ve seen are not sustainable a nd that there’s going to ha ve to be some mean reversion. So, if you put together moderate gr owth, likely weaker productivity gains, some strength in a few individual i ndustries—manufacturing and others —the presumption is that we will see some job creation and some positive payroll numbers pretty soon. That being said, I think I would come back to  the theme I echoed in a couple of speeches over the intermeeting period.  I stil l see the labor market and the cr edit market and the interaction between them as being major risk s and drags on the expansion.  In  the labor market, I think it’s really important for us to keep in mind what a deep hole we’re currently in.  To give two numbers that you don’t always ci te, the employment-to-population ratio has fallen from a peak of 62.7 percent to 58.5 in the most recent month—a very substantial decline in the number of people working. The aggregate weekly hours of  production workers has fallen more than 8 percent from the peak. Compare that with a decline of less than 6 percent in the 1981-1982    98 of 247recession—there has been an enormous decline in labor input.  And, as a number of people noted, starting with President Rosengren, that declin e in labor input is not simply bodies; it is on other dimensions as well—hours per week, overtime, and so on.  And as was also noted, as labor input increases, it will happen across a variety of  margins and not just on the unemployed.  In fact, given the duration of unemployment and the number of people who will be losing skills and labor force attachment, there may be some prefer ence, as firms go out and look for workers, to expand on the intensive margin rather than on hi ring people who will not be as attractive from the employer’s perspective.  Just to give you a sense, simple arithmetic says that an increase of 20 minutes in the average workweek is equivalent to one and a half million jobs in terms of labor input. So there is a very substantial substitutability across those dimensions. The second area that I talked about in my  remarks over the intermeeting period, of course, is credit. It was noted around the table by a number of pe ople that credit availability for large firms, including large ba nks, appears to be quite good, surprisingly good to some extent, whereas, for small businesses that are bank-de pendent, obviously conditions are much more difficult. There was an interesting discu ssion around the table about how significant the constraints on small business credit will be.  A nu mber of people noted that the NFIB surveys put small business views about tight credit as being only fourth or fifth on the list of concerns. But, remember, we are now in a period where, in some sense, the binding constraint is demand.  The question is: What will happen when there is scop e for expansion, and will firms be able to get the credit they need to expa nd?  I think it is instructiv e to recall the post-1990–1991 recession period, the period of the famous financial head winds, when banking conditions were much less severe than now. Credit extension was much be tter; NFIB indicators and the terms of credit from the survey of senior loan officers—all of those things were less severe than they are today  99 of 247 in the economy. So my best guess is that we will see some concerns about credit as the expansion begins, and that will be a reason for more moderate economic growth. Contributing to that is that  the situation is not like the post-1990–1991 period, where the problems fairly quickly resolved themselves over the subsequent coupl e of years.  We’re continuing to look, as a number of  people have noted, at still risi ng NPL rates, commercial real estate credit, and other issues th at will put stress on the banking  sector.  And, notably, Governor Duke made some very interesting points abou t the differences in product mixes between large and small banks.  In particular, small banks ar e both more vulnerable to the CRE problem and are a bigger source of credit for sm all businesses and local economies. Again, to summarize the two parts of my remark s there, the first wa s that I thought that the intermeeting data were encouraging, in the se nse that the moderate growth scenario looks more plausible and the risks to it seem less. But I don’t see a great deal at  this point to suggest that economic growth will be much greater than th e moderate pace scenario.  Going back to the jobless recovery theme, I think it is striking that the staff is projecting 200,000 to 300,000 jobs a month starting in the second quart er, with even more in 2011, and even so unemployment rates remain at 9.6 percent at the end of next year, fo r example.  So given those two things, given the depth of the hole we’re in, we’re going to need a lot of jobs to get back to more normal conditions. I think inflation conditions are fairly stable, though obviously not entirely satisfactory in all dimensions.  Over the intermeeting period, we did see oil prices down about $10, although distant futures prices did not change much, so th at doesn’t really change the trajectory very much. I was actually kind of encouraged to s ee the way the dollar has changed its behavior.  We’ve had this funny pattern where, whenever th ere’s a good day in the stock market, the dollar                                                       3 Materials used by Mr. Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). 100 of 247drops because of this safe-haven effect.  Sin ce the November employment report, we’ve gotten a more normal positive correlation—good news about the U.S. economy is good news for the dollar. I think that’s encouraging, because it  means that economic growth will not translate immediately into those kinds of import inflation pressures.  People discussed the difficulties of interpreting the TIPS spreads.  My overall sense is  that there’s not a major shift in the inflation expectations of the financial markets.  Likewise, the surveys of forecasters and households are also fairly benign. So all of those th ings, I think, are moderately encouraging. That being said, I do feel we are, in some sense, walking on eggshells, because there are so many delicate issues of confidence in financial institutions, in our fiscal position, in the Fed’s policies and exit strategy, that there just seems to  be a greater and pervasive sense of instability and risk, given what we have been through in the la st couple of years.  Bu t, again, I think overall the intermeeting period was good, and although we’re st ill a long way from where we want to be, we’re moving at least at some speed in the right direction.  So let me stop there.  Are there further que stions or comments about the economy?  [No response.] In my summary, I took note of our inte rest in discussing in January the elements of our policy framework—how we would think ab out exit and how we would think about communication and perhaps policy rules as well. So we’ll be in touch with you about some of those issues. If there are no further comments , I’ll turn to Brian to  start the second round.

MR. MADIGAN.3  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary  Policy Alternatives.”  This package includes the draft policy statemen ts for alternatives A, B, and C as they appeared in the Bluebook. Your policy decision today takes place against a backdrop of a gradual but fairly steady improvement in financial conditions  and in the economic outlook.  As David noted yesterday, the staff’s forecast for economic growth in the fourth quarter has been revised up noticeably. And the staff s ees the rate of expansion picking up steam      101 of 247over the next couple of years, reaching 4½ percent in 2011.  Moreover, as noted yesterday, some of you see the downside risk s to the forecast as continuing to ebb, extending a trend evident in your most recent quarterly forecasts.  Nonetheless, resource slack seems likely to remain s ubstantial for some time.  In the Greenbook forecast, that slack, together with stable inflation expectations, pushes inflation down to about 1 percent by the end of the forecast period.   With output seen as tracking well below its potential over the next few years and inflation projected to be e dging further below the level th at policymakers prefer over the intermediate term, the Committee might be dissatisfied with the outlook and believe that it could improve economic outcomes by providing additional policy stimulus.  The Committee might also see addi tional stimulus as warranted in order to guard against the lingering risk that sp ending, output, and employment could fall well short of the baseline outlook—for exampl e, because financial market conditions could relapse as a range of government s upport programs are withdrawn over the next few months.  Under alternative A, page  2 of the package, the Committee would provide additional stimulus by boosting its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities from the currently planned amount of $1.25 trillion to $1.5 trillion.  In order to accomplish the increase in purchases without putting undue strain on the MBS market, the Committee would extend the ti me frame for these transactions through the end of the second quarter. Planned pur chases of agency debt securities would stay at $175 billion. The Comm ittee would also leave its target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 0 to ¼ percent.  But it would alter its forward guidance slightly to indicate that it anticipated that economic conditions would warrant this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate—that is, 0 to ¼ percent—for an extended period of time, thus underscoring the “low for long” message.  Market participants appear to see little likelihood of an increase in asset purchases, and thus staff estimates suggest that a $250 billion increase in MBS purchases might lower longer-term rates by 10 to 25 basis points  and, through that channel, reduce the unemployment rate two years ah ead by a tenth or two of a pe rcentage point relative to the rate that would ot herwise prevail.   If the Committee instead believes that, in current circumstances, additional monetary policy stimulus would not be help ful on balance, it might prefer to adopt the policy actions and language  of alternative B, page 3.  For example, even though the outlook for real activity and employme nt may be unsatisfactory, policymakers might also believe they cannot take for gran ted that inflation exp ectations are tightly moored and worry that expanding asset purchases further could push inflation expectations upward. Also, despite significant strides in developing reserve management tools, the Committee sti ll might be unsure about their likely effectiveness.  If so, the Committee might th ink that the risks entailed in a further increase of asset purchases and the associ ated expansion of the balance sheet and reserves could outweigh the potential benefits. Under alternative B, the Committee woul d leave unchanged at this meeting the amounts and timing of its large-scale asset purc hases as well as its target range for the   102 of 247federal funds rate. The first paragraph of the announcement would set the stage for this decision by again noting that economic activity is picking up and by adding that the deterioration in labor markets is abati ng.  In view of the continued advance in equity prices over the intermeeting period and further declines in various private borrowing rates, the paragraph would note th at financial markets have become more supportive of economic growth.  The inflati on paragraph would continue to mention that the Committee expects that inflation wi ll remain subdued for some time.  And the third paragraph would again indicate that the Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of  resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation e xpectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. The most significant change relative to  the November statement would be the inclusion of the last paragraph.  In September and November, your statements noted that “the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and price stability.”  That followed your indications, expressed since last December, that the Federal Rese rve would be using “all available tools.”  With the LSAPs scheduled to wind down ove r the next few months , usage of many of the liquidity facilities dwindling or already at zero, and authorizations for many of the facilities currently extending only through Febr uary 1 and apparently likely to expire at that time, the Committee will soon need to make some adjustment to the “wide range” sentence. Under alternative B, th at sentence would be dropped today, and the Committee and the Board would indicate their anticipation that most of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities will expi re on February 1.  This statement would reference the June announcement that indi cated that “should the recent improvements in market conditions continue, the Board and the FOMC currently anticipate that a number of these facilities may not need  to be extended beyond February 1.”  The paragraph would indicate specifically that  the AMLF, the CPFF, the PDCF, and the TSLF were likely to be closed on February 1.  It would also note that the Federal Reserve would be working with its forei gn central bank counterparties to wind down the temporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1.  It would further indicate that the Federal Reserve expected to s cale back amounts provided under the TAF, and it would indicate that the anticipated expiration dates for the TALF remain unchanged. Importantly, the final sentence would note that the Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if nece ssary to support financial stability and economic growth. encompass relatively few changes from N ovember’s, more or less along the lines of the first three paragraphs of this alternativ e.  The inclusion of the fourth paragraph would probably come as a modest surprise, and, if anything, it might suggest a slightly greater inclination to  initiate policy firming than market participants expect.  However, given that most market participants  appear to expect the facilities to close on February 1, given the retention of th e key “extended period” language, and given the maintenance of the existing LSAP amounts, it seems unlikely that the fourth         103 of 247paragraph would cause the statement to pr ompt any significant market reaction on net. Another option, perhaps, would be to se parate the fourth paragraph from the Committee’s monetary policy statement a nd publish it on a standalone basis sometime in the next few days.  Indeed, ove r the past two years, the Federal Reserve has generally issued announcements related to liquidity facilities separately from FOMC statements.  However, that practi ce was driven importantly by the timing of It was also driven by the need to coordina te statements with foreign central banks, which generally made it impossible to release these announcements along with the FOMC’s policy statement.  In the current situation, we understand that foreign central banks do not feel the need to coordinate with a statement referencing the likely termination of the swap lines on February 1, so there would seem to be little need for delay on that score. Perhaps also arguing for inclusion in today’s statement is the point that, if the paragraph were to be rel eased separately sometime in the next few days, the announcement today would still need to be modified somehow to foreshadow that possibility and so not blindside market participants.  That modification obviously would be noticed and suggest that something was afoot. The Committee could also couple this pa ragraph with alternative C, page 4.  Under this alternative, the Committee woul d begin to reduce the degree of monetary policy stimulus at this meeting.  The Co mmittee might be motivated to take this action now if it did not anticipate that economic slack would be providing much restraint on inflation and was concerned that a large amount of stimulus is in train and risks eventually driving inflation upward, perhaps in part because of an effect on inflation expectations of th e very large and growing Fede ral Reserve balance sheet.  In providing the background for this action, the first paragraph of  the statement for alternative C would generally be similar to th at for alternative B, but it would not cite the list of factors restrain ing household spending or the continued cutback in business fixed investment.  The second paragraph w ould note the Committee’s expectation that inflation will remain at levels consistent with price stability, but it would base that expectation primarily on appropriate monetary policy adjustments rather than the substantial resource slack that is cited as an important fact or under alternative B.  The Committee would retain for now its target range of 0 to ¼ percent for the federal funds rate, but it would indicat e an expectation that economic conditions are likely to warrant “low levels,” rather than “exceptionally low levels,” of the federal funds rate for some time, rather than for an extended period.  Moreover, in view of continued improvements in financial markets and the economic outlook, the Committee would indicate that it decided to cap its purchases  of agency mortgage-backed securities at $1.1 trillion and its purchases of agency debt at $160 billion. Of course, market participants do not a ppear to anticipate a statement along the lines of alternative C. Even without th e final paragraph, the adjustment of the forward guidance and the reduction in asset purchases would come as a considerable surprise to market participants and woul d suggest that the Committee was preparing    104 of 247to begin to firm its policy stance relativel y soon.  As Brian Sack noted yesterday, a Desk survey indicated that most primary dealers believe that the Committee will remove the “extended period” reference at least three meetings before commencing tightening. So quite possibly market particip ants might see a shif t to an expectation that rates would remain low only “for some time” as suggesting that the Committee might begin to raise its target for the f unds rate in the spring, say, at the March meeting.  Interest rates would likely jump markedly in response to this information, prompting an increase in the foreign excha nge value of the dollar and a drop in equity prices. The inclusion of th e fourth paragraph on closing the facilities would amplify the message that the Federal Reserve wa s now moving quickly toward a significant tightening of policy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Are there questions for Brian?  [No response.] Okay. If there are no questions, let’s begin our go-round with President Yellen. 

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I fa vor alternative B, but I would like to emphasize something that I’ve said in the past.  I continue to see a pers uasive case for further policy easing. We are far below maximum sustai nable employment, infla tion is undesirably low, and almost any version of the Taylor Rule, as  well as the Bluebook’s optimal policy simulation, recommends a negative setting for the federal fund s rate at the present time.  We need to remind ourselves of this fact to count eract the very natural instinct to tighten policy as the economy recovers. It’s true that, if we had been free to lower the federal f unds rate into negative territory, it would probably be appropriate to start tightening in the not-too-distant future.  But we were constrained on the way down by the zero bound, and, in the face of that bound, systematic policy calls for us to hold the federal funds ra te near zero for a long time to come. Alternative B includes a paragraph addressing our special liquidity facilities.  I do not consider the proposed language ve ry controversial, with one exception.  I’m concerned about phasing out TALF support for newly issued CM BS.  I think it’s too soon to announce the termination of that support.   Outside of CRE lending, financial conditions have improved 105 of 247considerably, and it’s appropriate to allow the other facilities to expi re as scheduled.  The reaction should be minimal because few observers expect them to continue. In contrast, our decisions re lating to the LSAP programs are important from a policy perspective. The question of whether or not to reinvest SOMA holdings as they mature is an aspect of a broader policy decision concerning these programs.  I do see some advantage to allowing our agency-related holdings to run off.  This is a mechanistic strategy, but it creates a self-liquidating feature for our MBS portfolio—an exit strategy that shrinks our holdings over time in a manner that will be predictable to markets, minimizing the possibility of abrupt movements in yields that could result from further discretionary  asset purchases or sales and ongoing market speculation about our plans. I’m encouraged by the staff assessment that allowing our MBS holdings to run off is likely to raise mortgage rates by only a few basis poi nts.  If so, I think th e benefits of increased predictability and a well-defined exit strategy wi ll likely outweigh the sma ll, albeit undesirable, contractionary effects of permitting our MBS holdings to contract before we would ideally withdraw stimulus. My bigger concern is that  we just don’t know what will happen to MBS spreads and mortgage rates as we wind down our purchases over the next several months.  Many economy is still very weak, and the housing mark ets remain fragile, I think we may need to resume purchases.  I agree with President Bullard that it’s importa nt to preserve the flexibility to tailor LSAP purchases and sales to emerging economic and financial conditions. The final line in paragraph 3 states that our purchases are conditional on evolving conditions, and I consider that line to be more than mere boilerplate.  We will need to take that proviso seriously during the next few 106 of 247meetings as we gain a better idea of how winding down our programs is affecting spreads and yields. In the meantime, it’s wort h strategizing about whether there is any way for us to gear the pace of purchases or sales to evolving conditions  without targeting a specific mortgage rate and without creating undue uncertainty and excess volatility in the markets. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Rosengren. 

[SECTION]

MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support alternative B. The Greenbook assumes no change in in terest rates through 2010.  That is consistent with my own view of appropriate monetary po licy and is consistent with co mmunicating that we expect to maintain very low rates for an extended period of time.  If outcomes are similar to the Greenbook forecast, removing the “extended period” language is a topic best left for the second half of 2010.   Removal of that language is likely to set off a significant change in market interest rates.  It will not be appropriate until private sector growth is  on a sustainable path and labor markets have improved significantly. In terms of exit strategy, selli ng a portion of our holdings of mortgage-backed securities should not be done in 2010 if the economy unfolds as envisioned in the Greenbook forecast.  Uncertainty about the amount and sp eed of sales of our very larg e holdings of mortgage-backed securities would almost surely drive up the risk premium required by private purchasers of mortgage-backed securities. Conversations with  a variety of market participants in Boston indicate that such sales are not anticipated and would be viewed as a signal that we wanted mortgage rates much higher, with the potential  to dramatically slow  a housing sector just beginning to recover. Should the economy unfold as in the Greenbook forecast, with only gradual improvement in unemployment and the inflation rate well below 2 percent, I do not believe that we will need   107 of 247to raise rates either through increasing the intere st rate on reserves or re moving reserves from the system until at least the end of next year.  The risks to real side recovery remain significant, and the costs of the downside risks outweigh the costs associated with any upside risks. I’d like to follow up on the discussion yesterda y on the primary credit ra te.  If we were to keep the “extended period” language and raise th e primary credit rate in January, it may send a confusing signal to the market.  While we would likely want to raise the primary credit rate as we implement the term deposit facility, I would pref er to raise the primary credit rate closer to the time we are implementing the facility and possibly in conjunction with removing the extended period language, which I would hope would not be at the January meeting. I also concur with President Yellen’s co mment on the TALF.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Plosser. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Given the increasing signs that the economy is gaining momentum, I think it’s important for this Committee to consider language that begins to prepare the market for the possibility that we will need to begin reducing the degree of policy accommodation an d our interventions in private markets sooner rather than later. The time to change policy is not now, but I do believe the time is getting closer.  I think the language in alternative C does a better job of this than the langua ge in B, with the change in the forward guidance regarding the path of the funds rate substituting “some time” for “an extended period of time.”  I also no te that paragraph 3 in alterna tive C begins with the phrase “at this meeting.”  I wasn’t quite sure about the in tent of that, but my interpretation is—and I have some sympathy with the view—that this language does emphasize that things may change at some future meeting, and it sort of keeps our options open that changes can come to pass.    108 of 247My own view is that, as economic growth pi cks up and becomes more sustainable, real interest rates will rise.  Appetite for risk will increase, and that will l ead to a rise in the opportunity cost of the vast amount of excess re serves that sits in the system.  The money multiplier will go up, and those excess reserves w ill flow rapidly out into the economy, as the opportunity cost gets higher and higher for banks to hold onto th em.  The combination of more sustained growth and a flow of excess reserves in to the economy would mean that if we want to retain control over those excess reserves, we will have  to raise the policy rate.  So as real growth picks up and becomes more sustainable, our policy rates should rise with that.  Put another way, we may lose control of all those excess reserves. As I’ve discussed at earlier meetings, I favor  the inflation paragraph in alternative C primarily because it emphasizes the dependence of inflation on the stability of longer-term expectations and on policy adjustments that we will take to keep inflation levels consistent with price stability, both on the positive and negative side of our target. I like conveying this idea that it is monetary policy actions rather than stru ctural features of th e economy that influence inflation over the longer term.  Mo reover, I think that the language of paragraph 2 in alternative C will help stabilize and anchor expectations, as  it more strongly signals our commitment to maintain price stability.  I think this can only help us in a period when the dispersion in inflation forecasts has widened and uncertainty has increased.  As I said at our last meeting, the dispersion of the forecasts for long-term inflation, both in  our SPF survey and our Livingston survey, has widened noticeably, and this should concern us. I favor including the last paragraph of alterna tive B, which is repeated in alternative C, regarding the expiration of some of  our facilities on February 1 for three reasons.  First, and most importantly, I believe it is the right policy.  Th e improvement of financ ial conditions over the   109 of 247past year has been swifter than some of us mi ght have expected, and fi nancial conditions appear to be returning to normalcy.  I see no compelling reason at this point to keep the facilities open beyond February. Second, the market expects th at these facilities are going to be wound down early next year, so I don’t th ink the paragraph would cause mu ch of a market reaction, and it should help reduce uncertainty around that expe ctation.  Third, it’s becoming progressively harder to justify the existence of  some of these liquidity programs as financial market conditions improve.  I assume that the Governors are going to  have to take a decision soon about whether exigent and unusual circumstances c ontinue to exist to justify the programs.  In my view, it’s becoming harder and harder to do that.  My only comment is that it’s not  clear why we shouldn’t further reduce the size of TAF auctions at this po int.  They’re still significantly undersubscribed, and we haven’t been able to increase the rate. Th ere will likely be interactions with the term deposit facility, as we mentioned yesterday.  I suggest we reduce these auctions again to see if we can’t get supply more in line with demand. As to our discussion yesterday about increasi ng the penalty rate, the discount rate, I’ll repeat my plea on this.  I’m sympathetic with President Rosengren and repeat my plea that we not treat our exit tools in  isolation.  We need to treat them collectively and have a discussion in monetary policy framework we’ll want  to use after this exit strategy is over.  That is, we need to know not only where we’re going, but also how all of these different tools fit together to get us there, because there are a lot of  interactions.  It’s difficult to determine the appropriate exit strategy and optimal size of our  balance sheet without knowing which alternative monetary policy implementation framework we’re headed towa rds and what our policy rate strategies will be. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.      110 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  President Kocherlakota. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In our November statement, we committed to maintaining a target range of zero to  25 basis points for the fed funds rate as long as the economy continued to exhibit low rates of  resource utilization, s ubdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations. I believe that those conditions are still in place, and so I am happy to maintain the fed funds rate in that target range. Also, for the reasons ably described by Pres ident Plosser, I support committing ourselves to plans for ending the liquidity faci lities as is done in both alternatives B and C.  I do not see the utility of our buying the extra $150 billion of agency MBS and $15 billion of agency debt in alternative B, but I am w illing to support the thrust of the alternative, because our language in the purchases. With that said, I am concerned that alterna tive B is so silent about our plans for the balance sheet beyond March. I would recommend ch anging the last sentence of alternative B to read, “The Committee will continue to evaluate  the size and composition of its holdings of securities in light of the e volving economic outlook and conditions  in financial markets,” so that’s basically changing from “purchases” to “holdings.”  This change would communicate to the public that we may choose to reduce the balance sheet by failing to reinvest or by selling assets. My own view is that we should begi n such a reduction in the second quarter of 2010, at least by failing to reinvest and, more  desirably, through additional sales. Why do I favor reducing the balance sheet?  Well , first, the benefits of our interventions in these markets have fallen greatly.  I am convinced from evidence offered by the New York Fed that the LSAP had big benef its in late 2008 and early 2009, but  during that period financial  111 of 247markets were functioning poorly.  Risk prem ia in particular markets became largely disconnected from one another.  But as pa ges 12 and 13 of the Bluebook emphasize, these conditions have greatly ameliora ted, and investors can more r eadily substitute across various financial assets.  In these circumstances, reducing our positions will have a muted effect on yields. The benefits, therefore,  of our big balance sheet have been greatly reduced, and our big balance sheet is not without cost .  It confronts us with the low probability possibility of high inflation. Banks have $1 trillion of excess reserves.  These reserves represent an inflation risk generated from potential change s in household expectations. The logic here is simple.  If households believ e that the price level is about to rise, they will demand more liquid deposits in order to make their transactions.  One of the five memos for the inflation dynamics session we’r e going to get is by Simon Potte r and other coauthors, and it indicates how increases in government debt can lead to exactly those kinds of changes in household beliefs. Given those changes, banks can readily accommodate  the extra demand for deposits because they’re holding so many excess rese rves.  The extra deposits in the hands of households become extra money chasing the same  amount of goods, which ha s the possibility of generating inflation. In this way excess reserves  are a vehicle for househol ds’ expectations about inflation to become reality. One way this chain of events could take place is for banks to make additional loans.  However, their doing so would mean that th ey would be significantly changing the risk composition of their portfolios.  My own belief is  that deposit creation would be fueled instead by households and firms selling banks relatively i lliquid but relatively riskless securities like corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and Treasurie s.  Households and firms now own about $4 trillion in such securities, which is enough to expand demand deposits by 600 percent.  This       112 of 247expansion, obviously an extreme cas e, would put enormous pressure on the price level.  I’d be the first to say that this inflationary chain is only a possibility, and I agree with market assessments that it currently has a low probability  of occurring.  But one lesson I have taken away from the past five years is that our conduct of policy shoul d take account of exactly these kinds of low-probability  adverse tail events. The staff is currently exploring the use of  reverse repos and term deposits.  These facilities have potentially useful ways to accomm odate transient reductions of excess reserves.  In contrast, asset sales are a more effective co mmitment to a permanent reduction in our balance sheet. This difference means that, at a minimum,  asset sales are a useful complement to term deposits or reverse repos. As I say, I would like to see shrinkage in our balance sheet beginning in the second quarter of 2010, but now I think it’s worthwhile for us to start to foreshadow that possibility by changing the language of alternativ e B as I have recommended to refer to holdings of securities as opposed to simply talki ng about purchases.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Fisher. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Well, Mr. Chairman, on page 156 of the 177 pages of the last transcript, I said, “My one suggestion, which I don’t think will car ry the table, is that we change the term ‘extended period’ to ‘for some time.’”  Mr. Chairman, my one suggestion, which I don’t think will carry the table, is th at if we do change the term “extended period,” we change it to “for some time.”  I’m going to be a broken record on th at, but I know it will not carry the table. Here’s the point.  I’m against expanding the balance sheet.  I take the comments just made by my predecessor commentator  quite seriously.  But I do believe that the language in alternative B is acceptable even without changing “for an extended period.”  113 of 247I would note President Rosengren’s excellent poi nt that we consider the treatment of the spread on primary credit and its juxtaposition against the “extended period” language.  I actually was caught quite flat-footed by th at discussion ye sterday—unprepared for it.  I’d like some time to think about commenting on it.  I’d like to see where it is sequenced into our exit strategy.  I understand the theoretical desire to re-widen that  spread.  I do worry about the signal it’s going to send, by the way, to small and community bankers.  I don’t quite understand the full composition of who accesses primary credit, and I could see some interpreting it as:  “You’re still biased towards the big guys who are more active in the fed funds market and penalizing smaller borrowers who may want to access the prim ary credit window.”  So I’d like more time, and I’m a little bit concerned that we’re rushing that discussion, particularly in the context of these broader things we have been talking about.  So I would ask ve ry much that we not rush this into the first week of January. To sum up:  against expansion of the balan ce sheet, remain concerned about the phrase “extended period,” because I thi nk we’ve boxed ourselves in there—we didn’t get much for it, but it’s there. The third paragraph is very good. We did what  we said we were going to do when it was necessary to do it, and we’re done.  We aim to co mplete these liquidity facilities and, indeed, we signaled that we’re on that road for asset purch ases unless, as Presid ent Yellen points out, it becomes necessary, which I think we cover in the ve ry last sentence, to m odify our plans in order to preserve financial stability and economic growth. I have one other editorial suggestion in the first paragraph whether we use alternative B or C. We talk about the housing sector.  We  talk about household spending.  We talk about business still cutting back on fixed investment.  A nd yet, in your excellent summary of what we  114 of 247said, we have one point that is  not included in there, which is the reluctance of businesses to expand overhead, including payrolls. My editorial suggestion would be  at the end of the sentence that begins with “businesses are sti ll cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in  bringing inventor y stocks into better alignment with sales, but remain reluctant to expand overhea d, including payrolls.”  I would insert that in either B or C. It is nowhere el se referenced in this statement,  and I think it’s a very important point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Say it again, please. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Yes, sir. With  the sentence that reads, “Bus inesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace; th ey continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sale s.”  I would add, “but remain reluctant to expand overhead, including payrolls.” This is what we  heard at the table.  You summarized it eloquently. It is not in the statement, and I think it should be.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. Thank you. Governor Kohn. MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I supp ort alternative B.  On the first two paragraphs, I thought they nicel y captured the sligh tly better outlook that  we heard around the table, but without changing the fundamental contour s of the expansion that most of us expect.  So I thought they were in pretty good shape. On President Fisher’s s uggestion, I think I would amend your suggestion in the following way.  I think this would be okay—it would be interesting to hear what othe r people think.  “Bus inesses are still cutting back on fixed   115 of 247investment, though at a slower pace, and they remain reluctant to a dd to payrolls.”  I think this reference to overhead is  a little confusing. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Well, payrolls are a big part of overhead.  So that would be—but I think we need to include that point.

MR. KOHN. Then “they continue to make progr ess.”  I think we did hear that around the table, and it’s not inconsistent with the notion that the deteriora tion of labor market is abating.  So I think that w ould be all right. On the third paragraph, I agree with an awful lot of what President Yellen said.  I think we’re still in an unsatisfactory place, with the outlook for income, employment, and inflation still suboptimal for the next several years, even with a negative real federal funds rate in place.  If we had a positive nominal federal funds rate, I’d prob ably be arguing for some easing, but we don’t.  I think there’s uncertainty about the benefits of adding to our longer-term purchases and some costs to that as well, so I’m not prepared to argue for that.  So I’ m fine with leaving that as we have it. But I do think it’s important, as Presid ent Kocherlakota said, th at we’re looking at low rates of resource utilization for some time,  subdued inflation trends—we just had some confirmation of that this morning—a nd stable inflation expectations. So I feel very strongly that we need to retain the “extended period” language. With every improvement in the economy and w ith the passage of time, we get closer to the eventual time when we’ll have to tighten pol icy, but I think that’s still some time away.  I worry that the natural real rate could be very lo w for some time.  The stor y we’re telling is one in which we have these headwinds, as you’ve been  saying, Mr. Chairman, in bank credit, and as they go away, things kind of snap back and the policy rate can be normalized by historic standards under those circumstances. 116 of 247My concern is that we came into this episode with not a very high real interest rate, which seemed consistent with the economy producing at right around full employment and not much inflation pressure outside the commodity and petr oleum sector.  We have to replace a bunch of consumption.  So presumably consumption as a proportion of GDP is going to be lower going forward, financial services as a proportion of GDP are going to be lower going forward, and residential construction as a pr oportion of GDP is going to be lower going forward.  This is a much more balanced economy.  But we need to crowd in investment and net exports to replace all that, especially because I don’t think any of us want to crowd in government to replace all of that on a permanent basis.  That’s not a sustaina ble situation.  So I thi nk the issue of when to begin normalization of the real fe deral funds rate and what that ’s going to look like is one in which I see a potential for a lot of softness for a long time to come.  And I think it’s too early, President Kocherlakota, to change the purchases to  holdings.  Let’s consider that as part of the late January meeting when we  discuss the exit strategy. On the last paragraph, I am in favor of incl uding it—the funding markets have returned to normal in most areas, short-term markets and banks are able to access funds without our help, with people issuing commercial paper or accessing f unding without our help.  It’s not an entirely riskless thing to suspend these. We don’t know to  what extent our being there as a backstop is providing the confidence to keep these markets going, and all of this funding has occurred in the context of very reduced demands for funding.  Banks and corporations are shrinking their balance sheets. When that tu rns around, it’s not clear what’s going to happen.  So it’s not riskless, but it’s worth taking the ri sk.  I think we need to do that and wind up these facilities and see what happens.    117 of 247Securitization markets ar e a more difficult picture, I th ink, especially for the new issue CMBS, as President Yellen pointed out. It’s sti ll a troubled market.  There’s very little activity. I did hear some mildly encouraging things from Brian Sack yesterday.  It ’s beginning to come back. Still, I think we could stick with the cu rrent wording, but, as Pres ident Yellen noted, we should take that last sentence seriously. If we get into the spring and the new issue CMBS then. I think it’s a good idea to include this paragraph in the announcement.  This is a collaborative effort between the Board and the FOMC.  I think as long as the “extended period” language is still here, people won’ t take it as an early exit signal but rather appropriately as a signal that we see the financial markets are working better and we don’t need the unusual liquidity backups. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Bullard. 

[SECTION]

MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also support alternative B, but with one change. I would agree with President Plosser that the inflation paragraph from alternative C is the more appropriate one.  The inflation paragr aph in alternative C says the following:  “Longer­term inflation expectations have been stable, and the Committee expects that, with appropriate monetary policy adjustments, inflation will remain at levels consistent with price stability.”  I think that’s a better statement of  what we’re up to here at the FO MC.  It takes ownership of the inflation outcomes, which I think is appropria te for the Committee, and I also think that statement does not preclude any factors that might  influence inflation.  We look at many things.  We look at all the indicators that we can, both in the U.S. and globally, and the factors that might influence inflation.  But it does claim responsibilit y that at the end of the day it’s up to us to maintain low and stable inflation.   118 of 247Future statements may have to reconsider wh at we’re saying about the federal funds rate.  I think this is an issue that we need to think a bout.  Is the federal funds  rate really the primary interest rate instrument going forward?  I thought Brian Sack’s report highlighted issues about federal funds rate control in the environment in the next few y ears, maybe longer.  It seems to me that might have implications for credibility a nd communication for the Co mmittee, and so I think we need to think about that issue.   In particular, is the interest rate on reserves being viewed as the primary policy rate going forward, and is that  sensible, and does that work in our models? The next meeting will be an important one for thinking about how to play the asset purchase program going forward.  We can discuss it in  more detail at that time, but, as I said yesterday, I would prefer that we  think carefully about how to ac tively manage the return of the balance sheet both to normal levels, as one conc ern, and to an appropriate mix of assets as another concern. With the very la rge size, we’re going to have to do that over a period of years, so we need a strategy about how we’re going to  get there so that we don’t have to make adjustments in any sudden fashion. Again, as we all agree, I think interest ra tes may remain near zero according to the Greenbook over the next two years. The Committ ee needs a clear plan for how to react to incoming data during that period.  Otherwise, what ’s going to happen is th at, at the end of the first quarter?  We’re going to be perceived as going on hold and perhaps staying on hold for a long time, but information is going to roll in about the performance of  the economy.  We may want to adjust policy during that period, especially if the news is particularly strong or particularly weak, which can easily happen, accord ing to the estimates of uncertainty around our forecast.  119 of 247Our asset purchase program has been consider ed successful, according to staff analysis.  We could use that program to adjust policy goin g forward, as we remain at the near-zero policy rate. I would see the asset purchase program as a substitute for the policy easing we would have undertaken had we been able to do so.  It seems logical to me th at we would gradually withdraw some of the policy accommodation coming from the asset-purchase program as the economy improves.  That would substitute for tightening that  we would not be willing to do with the rise in rates. Also, we should stand ready to do more with the asset-purchase program should information on the economy come in weaker than  expected.  Again, as many have pointed out, there’s plenty of downside risk as well as upsid e risk.  I think the former Chairman of this Committee said that uncertainty isn’t just a fact of  life, it’s a defining feature of how we have to deal with policy. I agree with President Kocherlakota’s suggest ion on holdings in the third paragraph.  I thought that was a good suggestion. I support that. I also support President Fisher’s suggestion in paragraph 1, perhaps as modified by Gover nor Kohn, but I thought that  was a good point, too.  And I agree with the comments that have been made about the final paragraph.  I support the final paragraph as written. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Hoenig. MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It’s an interesting meeting.  The way I’m trying to think of the c ontext is that economic circumstances obviously have changed.  You and others have described them.  Y ou might think of this meeting as  an inflection point, where we’re beginning to think a little bit differently about how we’re doi ng monetary policy and how we might do it in the future.  There are a couple of as pects to it.  In this meeting, we’re beginning to describe, I guess, more definitely our exit from th e extraordinary facilities that we’ve engaged in.    120 of 247Paragraph 4 walks us through that, and I think th at’s a good thing.  And I also would probably be in agreement as we move to January for the incr ease in the spread.  With that, I do agree with President Plosser that we should also increase the minimum acceptable bid rate on the TAF as we go forward to keep that in line.  So  that is, kind of, phase 1 of this.   Phase 2 is the more difficult, and that ’s the process of removing the highly accommodative policy and perhaps firming policy as we go forward.  That, of course, will depend, as many have said, on a variety of economic circumstances.  But that’s always the case. I’m very sensitive to the fact that unemployment  will be very slow to come down over the next several quarters, but I also would remind the Committee that if we started today, it would be a long time before monetary policy is brought back up to what most would consider a normal policy under normal circumstances as well.  We ’re going to have an accommodative policy for many quarters ahead, even if we were to start removing some of it today, and we shouldn’t lose sight that.  We need to be thinking about re moving this accommodative policy and restoring our balance sheet, as others have said, to pre-crisis levels. We need  to do that in gingerly way, of course, but we also need to begi n to prepare the markets for that. I’m very concerned.  I know how we need to  be walking on eggshells, I really do.  But I’m very concerned about this “extended period” language when we’re near zero, because it also provides a safe harbor for those who are going to engage, and are, in fact, engaged, in speculative activities around that, and we encourage that, and I think there is a price to pay at the other end of this. So as I balance this out, I’m not inclined to wordsmith things, but I do have a slight preference for C for a couple of reasons.  I think it does more forcefully respond to the fact that conditions have improved.  It  does allow us to scale back some of the purchases that, in my opinion, should be scaled back, and it does ch ange the language from “extended period” to  121 of 247“some time.”  I think, yes, there would be some  jitteriness in the market, perhaps, but, at the same time, it would set the stage for giving peop le some confidence that things are improving and that we are, in fact, anticip ating and avoiding some of the mistakes of the past that we are duly being reminded of.  So that’s ho w I view it at this time.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Lockhart. 

[SECTION]

MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B. I think it’s premature to reduce stimulus, and I support re taining the “extended period” language.  My soundings of participants in the financial market s suggest that, whether we like it or not, this “extended period” language has become a fixation, and it gives us little flexibility until we really are genuinely ready to signal that we are going to tighten the policy ra te.  So I don’t see the benefits at this stage of coming off that language. I also support the inclusion of the language in the final paragr aph.  I think this language is a useful reaffirmation of our intent, and I see the inclusion of paragr aph 4 as furthering a communications practice of clar ifying various exit questions re lated to management of the balance sheet. Having said that , if I understood President Yellen ’s suggestion, I am sympathetic to the removal of the TALF se ntence, if that was her suggestion, because I see the commercial real estate problem going forward as possibly requiring continuing use of TALF in support of the CMBS market. Perhaps it does not require comment, but I will say I am comfortable with the Desk’s recommendation of an interim policy pending furt her deliberation starting next month of not reinvesting proceeds of maturing MBS and agen cy securities.  I also agree with the recommendation to wait on the decision regardin g the Treasury’s portfolio.  I’m comfortable with that because, given the small amount of matu rities in the near term, I think these interim 122 of 247arrangements will have little effect on the market’s interpretation of our policy direction. I think it’s worth commenting on that because we’re pla nning next month to discuss the overall exit policy. I see in January and possibly in subsequent meetings that the Comm ittee is going to have to take up a number of questions  that are quite complex regard ing exit implementation—when to begin active shrinking of the balance sheet, what  tools to use, and wh at proportion and what sequence or what combination, and how much tact ical adjustment is required in response to developments in the financial markets and the ec onomy.  These are going to  be very challenging questions, because there are so many policy variab les at play and possibl e economic states that we will be dealing with.  So I would have been proposing something like the Chairman’s suggestion. Let me just say that I welcom e the January session, and I hope we devote a significant period of time to it. Like President Fisher, I was a bit taken by surprise or flatfooted by the recommendation on the primary credit rate, and I too would like to hear more discussion on that, and I think President Rosengren also commented that he ha d doubts regarding the timing of this, and I share those doubts as well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. President Lacker. MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have  some attraction for alternative C.  I don’t think we need to provide further stimulus  over the next couple of months by buying more MBS. If we had committed a couple of months ago to buying the amount listed in alternative C, I don’t think we would decide to increase th at amount to match up with alternative B. I think that President Kocherlakota was very  eloquent about the concerns about our balance sheet, especially our strategy past Ma rch.  I think Mr. Sack’s graphs showing the 123 of 247option-adjusted spread on MBS is stunning. It shows that we have driven MBS spreads well below historic norms.  And I think it’s worth keeping in mind that those historic norms already reflected an implicit subsidy due to the perceive d status of the government sponsored enterprises as benefiting from a government guarantee.  Pres ident Kocherlakota pointed  to the value of our asset purchases last fall and earlier this year in improving market function, and the natural metric for that is spreads. These spreads have not onl y restored market functioning, if you take them as a serious indicator, but we have gone beyond that, and we’re subsidizing the housing market now. I think we should look at our MBS strate gy in terms of the composition of aggregate demand that we want to foster.  Do we want to tilt aggregate demand towards housing and away from other components?  I understa nd the need to stabilize the housing market, and we did that earlier this year. The market was in freefall.  Prices were falling.  That was cutting household net worth. People were cutting back on consump tion.  They did not know where things were going. But the market is broadly stabilized now.  Pr ices have pretty much stabilized at the national level, though there is local price movement.  Grante d, there is a huge foreclosure overhang, but the market is working through those foreclosures, working through those workouts, transferring thos e assets to productive hands.  I do n’t see the need to drive MBS down further, and I don’t think as a long-run matter we want to be skewi ng demand towards housing construction. It’s an easy fix for a weak econom y.  It’s easy to get thos e construction teams out there putting foundations in and putting up frames, but if we haven’t built too much housing now, I am not sure when in our history we ever ha ve.  Having said all of that, I do believe I can bring myself to support a lternative B on the grounds that we al ready have made a commitment to  124 of 247purchase the full allotment at the next two mee tings, and perhaps not enough has changed since that decision two months ago. One thing I like very much about alternat ives B and C is the new final paragraph announcing the winding down of our presence.  I think it will be interpreted as an “all clear” siren, a signal of our view that the financial market crisis is mo re or less over and the conditions are no longer unusual and exigent.  I think that’s a good signal to send.  I think it will contribute to a little more confidence at the margin in the recovery. I believe we should let mortgage-backed securitie s roll off as they mature.  I think that the primary credit rate is worth thinking about  and studying, but again, li ke President Fisher, I was caught unawares by that i ssue and would like to go back and put some numbers down on paper about potential slopes of the yield curve and in the prim ary credit rate and think about what it means for the term deposit facility a nd our overall configurati on.  President Plosser mentioned this as well. The TALF sentence—I’d like to see it remain the way it is.  I still haven’t seen evidence that the CMBS market is remedially fixable.  Quantities are low, but it sure looks like fundamentals are troubled there. “Holdings” I think would be a useful ch ange.  I support President Kocherlakota’s suggestion that we reword our reference to our assets in te rms of “holdings.” I also support Presiden t Bullard’s suggestion to move pa ragraph 2 of alternative C into paragraph 2 of alternative B, a lthough if we don’t do that after today’s discussion of inflation dynamics and output gaps, we might want to think about replacing th e phrase “substantial resource slack,” with “low marginal cost.”  [L aughter]  But we can deba te that later.  That concludes my remarks.   125 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I’m sorry.  I’m a little confused about what President Kocherlakota said. Would you rep eat your suggestion about holdings?

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. I understand that. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. But I hear your concern.  Pr esident Evans.  126 of 247MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support alternative B.  I think the continued monetary policy accommodation is appropriate.  The unemployment rate is at 10 percent, and core inflation is below my guideline of 2 percent. I agree with the economic marker s that are listed in the pa ragraph on inflation—the rates will remain low for an extended period of time due to low rates of res ource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable infl ation expectations, and I do put substantial weight on all three of those. I was fascinated to hear Governor Kohn’s di scussion of real rates and how the natural real rate might be low for some period of time.  That did stand in contrast  to President Plosser’s discussion about how policy really  might need to chase the real  rate up.  As Don discussed, there’s a need to replace consumption expenditure s and other types of investment, and I believe that, inherent in Charlie’s commentary, he did not have that same type of need.  Really, this is just resource slack finding its way into a real rate discussion.  I think it bo des well for us to have a robust discussion of these issues  and recognize that it finds its wa y into a number of different Although the unemployment rate is 10 percent and is expected to improve only slowly— that’s the bad side—I still believe  that a funds rate at about zero  plus our large balance sheet is about as much as we can do and as much as we should do.  I heard President’s Yellen’s very good point about how we need to be  patient—if we’d instead been ab le to adjust policy in a more accommodative fashion, then we’d be able to rebound a little bit more quickly, but because we can’t do that, this is a reminder that we need to be patient in this atti tude. I agree with that. I do think that the first-order effect of our large-scale asset purchases last spring was a nonlinear change in confidence that changed th e tone for the way the economy was going.  I  127 of 247think it’s probably very hard to come up with m eaningful stimulative effects out of that, but at any rate, I do believe that we will need to recalibrate policy in a number of ways in 2010. I support the winding down of our lending facilities, as stated in alternative B.  I support generally redeeming the MBS and agency debt as  they mature as a very light way to head towards getting our balance sheet in  the right direction.  I don’t th ink that that will be a move that’s too accelerated towards re strictive policy.  And I support th e continued preparations that you have described in thinking about our exit strategy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Pianalto. 

[SECTION]

MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Before beginning to shift the current stance on monetary policy, I would like to see th e economy on a more solid footing.  Therefore, I support alternative B. I am clearly in a minority.  In fact, I think I am the only person so far that was going to raise concerns about adding paragraph 4 to th e alternative B language.  I agree with the assessment that conditions in financial markets have been normalizing, and I see great value in informing the public after this m eeting about the termination of our  special liquidity facilities, but I am concerned that adding this paragraph to our statement today might imply that we are beginning to tighten the stance of policy.  So I was going to suggest  that we avoid any confusion at this point and issue a separate  statement.  But releasing two distinct statements doesn’t seem practical, and no one else has suggested it. One suggestion I had was to add a word like “separately” in the beginning of paragraph 4, so  it would read something like, “Separately, in light of the ongoing improvements in the functioning of financial markets,” et cetera. But that said, the only other comment I wanted to make is that, just like many others, I concur with President Rosengren’s comments ar ound making changes to the primary credit rate.   128 of 247It would be helpful to have more discussion about that at our next meeting.  And if we do make a change, then coupling it with th e introduction of the term deposit facility or other exit strategy communications would be preferable.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Warsh. 

[SECTION]

MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Four qui ck points.  First, I support alternative B with the Fisher-Kohn amendment about the relu ctance by businesses to add head count.  While I’m sympathetic to the views President Lacker de scribed on the incremental net benefits of our MBS purchases, which I have discussed for some tim e, we’ve now said that we were going to do it, and there’s nothing that we’ve learned between the last meeting and this meeting that would cause me to say that now is the right time to sa y, “Just kidding.”  So I think we should live up to what we said, because it would be, I think, a c onfusing retrenchment to go back to a smaller purchase level, even though, as a first impression many months ago, I would have been sympathetic to that view. Second, I support ending the existing liquidity facilities, and I guess I’m  of the view that we shouldn’t relegate that to a separate statemen t.  We should make it a virtue.  We put these facilities in place. They did all that we expected them to do and probably more.  They’ve served their purpose. It is time for th em to move on, and I think we shoul dn’t be sheepish about that.  I take that last line as seriously, I think, as President Yellen does.  When we say that we’re “prepared to modify,” I don’ t think that’s boile rplate at all.  I think th at says we’re still very attentive to what’s going on. So, with respect to TALF or any ot her facilities, we need to be more aggressive as the financ ial conditions and economic conditi ons warrant.  I think we’re prepared to do so, but I don’t think we should shy away from that.   129 of 247Third, on the question about the language around the purchases of securities, I’d like to make two points on what President Kocherlako ta said.  First, I just like saying that, “Kocherlakota.”  [Laughter] By next meeting I will be able to say the whole name without—.  So that’s my first highly value-added point on the suggestion.  My sec ond is that I think we should think about how to describe this mix of re demptions and purchases.  I’m not sure this is the right moment, but I think he does spark a pret ty interesting thought.  A nd just one other word for consideration if we take this discussion up in January, rather than  choosing purchases or holdings, I wonder whether “portfolio” is better. “P ortfolio” takes into acc ount that mix of what you might be adding and what you might be subtracting—it has an  allocation point associated with it. So I don’t know the pe rfect words, but I think it’s  an interesting discussion. And finally, I support Brian Sack’s recommenda tion on the runoff of MBS as an interim solution. I think it might be an interim solution that , at least in my eyes, lasts for more than this intermeeting period, but at least for now, I think that’s a prudent idea.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Duke. MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support alternative B.  I am worried that the backup in mortgage rates as the purcha ses wind down could be on the high side of projections, primarily because I’ m concerned about who might emerge as the substitute buyer.  The Treasury programs and the GSEs are approachi ng the point where they need to reduce their portfolio holdings.  My conversations with bankers  indicate that they’re completely unwilling to purchase mortgage-backed securities without kno wing exactly what’s going to happen with our purchases and with potential sales. So consider ing President Kocherlakota’s—I can say it, too— suggestion in that light, I think we should talk a little bit about what we might do on sales and the   130 of 247composition of the portfolio.  But I wonder if changing it without any further clarity on that might not cause even more concern over purchasing MBS. Second, even if we find ourselves in a position where we’d like to pr ovide more stimulus, it’s not clear to me that the last couple hundred bi llion reserves have really  made an awful lot of difference. At the same time, if we resume purchasing the mortgage-back ed securities, it would make it even easier politically to push resolution of the GSEs even further into the future.  And I firmly believe that the emergence of the GSEs fr om conservatorship, just as many of the larger financial institutions are coming out of government assistance, and determin ing what future they might have are going to be prere quisites for the restart of private mortgage markets.  I don’t see how housing markets return to  normal without th e full spectrum of housing finance. Third, the role of TALF in CMBS—it seems to me that, with the newly issued CMBS, the first new deal that came to market was so  conservatively underwri tten and had so much investor protection in order to be  able to qualify for TALF that that was the very reason that it attracted the investor interest th at it did.  And I would hope that that process would actually be able to continue through the next six months, and I’m uncertain that  we could do more past June.  So I’m not as worried about that one ending in June.  And I fervently wish we had been able to do the same thing for residential mortgage-b acked securities.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  Governor Tarullo. 

[SECTION]

MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thi nk the nature of this discussion so far has confirmed what I suspected comi ng into this meeting, which is th at we’re right on the cusp of starting to make hard decisions. We’re not quite there yet, but everybody is positioning themselves.  And in that spirit, I want to position myself.  [Laughter]  While supporting alternative B, I want to draw a distinction be tween the substance of what I think we are doing  131 of 247with the actions indicated in paragraphs 3 and 4 of alternative B and the way in which we’re communicating it. I have no problem with the firs t; I do have some concerns with the second.   With respect to substance, I think what we are saying in paragraph 4 is that we had a series of very special programs that were a ddressing blockages in credit markets that were instituted over the last year or so.  The unusual blockages and th e large dysfunctionality in credit winding down most, and eventually all, of these programs.  Second, I think we’re saying that we’re wrapping up the large-scale asset purchases that we announced in March.  Third, we’re continuing, obviously, the zero interest rate policy.  And, fourth, we haven’t made any decisions on exit as of yet. So I’m fine with all of those. On the language, I think paragraph 1 captu res well the consensus around the table with the Richard-Don amendment, which I think would be very useful.  Let me jump to paragraph 4, because I think paragraph 4 does ha ve the potential to surprise markets.  I don’t think the actions themselves will surprise markets—I think this is what’s anticipated.  But the fact of including it in this statement, as Sandy suggested a few minute s ago, may be a surprise and will begin to, or could begin to, elicit a lot of sp eculation as to whether this is, in fact, the beginning of a staged, already planned exit. As all of  you know, the amount of speculation among market actors as to what the exit plan is, with date s and quantities, is very high right  now.  So the last sentence, as Kevin and others have suggested, ought to be taken seriously by us, and not be considered as boilerplate. I have to say, on the merits I’m  quite comfortable with the winding down as anticipated, with the pos sible exception of CMBS. That brings me to paragraph 3.  When Brian Madigan sent around the language last week, I looked at it and, for the reasons I have already indicated, I was a little uncomfortable, but I felt  132 of 247that it was okay. I thought that the last se ntence of paragraph 3 was on the verge of being anachronistic, but wasn’t quite there, so that it could await the January meeting.  Brian Sack’s informative and admirably forthright briefing yesterday injected some doubt into my mind about that, because of the anticipated runoff issue. Ag ain, it’s not that the an ticipated runoff seemed ill-advised as a substantive matter, but I do have some concern about what’s being communicated by allowing those runoffs to happe n.  Will there now be a firm view in the the future? If there’s a fair chance that that wi ll be the inference drawn, then we would be faced, if conditions deteriorate in the future, with a de cision that would be regarded as a significant change in policy, a switching on and off of the lights as it were, ra ther than turning the dimmer switch a little bit in one direction or another.  For that reason, I was actually somewhat attracted by Narayana’s suggestion 

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. That’s anothe r beautiful name.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. TARULLO. Even though, obviously, our polic y inclinations are probably different, I took Narayana’s suggestion to be a kind of gene ral statement of the Bullard doctrine, which Jim patiently repeats ever y six or seven weeks in this room—[laughter]—about the need for flexibility depending on circumstances.  I think that, while I could live with waiting one more month or six or seven weeks, to change that la st sentence of paragraph 3, I have to confess to some uneasiness as to what we’re projecting to ma rkets in staying with th is sentence, given the way I think that paragraph 4 and the slight changes of wording in paragraph 3 will be understood. One final point—to Jeff’s point on MBS—I have two reactions to that.  One, for reasons many people stated in the go-round yesterday, mort gage rates and residential housing could still  133 of 247be key to the path of recovery next year, and thus may be important to affect or to observe the effects of one way or the other. But, secondl y, in the absence of conve ntional monetary policy easing possibilities, because of the zero bound, we found in March we had two choices.  We had the agency MBS, basically, and then we had Trea suries.  And Treasuries raise a whole different set of concerns about the possi ble interaction with fiscal policy and maybe even foreign exchange policy that I think a lo t of people around the table wanted  to avoid.  So I think it’s not just about the mortgage credit mark ets, even though to some degree it is  about mortgage credit

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Vice Chairman. 

[SECTION]

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Th ank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m very happy to see that we’re going to have the discussion on sequencing in January.  I thi nk it’s going to be very, very important to see if we can reach a consensus vi ew on strategy and tactics.  The market is definitely wondering what those strategy and tactic s are going to be.  Unti l then, I think it would be useful not to debate this too much in the pres s, because I think that just creates confusion.  I notice that in the primary dealer survey, the communications score we got this time came down a bit, and I think some of our discussion about asset sales vers us no asset sales might have contributed to confusion on that front. I’m not going to say where I stand right now on how to do the sequencing, but I do want people to start thinking about two broad issues.  One is the timing of asset sales, and on that, I think there are two major views:  one, starting w ith draining reserves and raising the short-term rate with asset sales held in  abeyance, maybe used, maybe not; and, two, conducting asset sales first, and then moving on to raising short-term in terest rates later.  I think that’s a really important thing that we’re going to have to sort out.  The second broad issue is the sequencing of   134 of 247reserve-draining operations versus the increase in the IOER rate.  The market thinks that we’re going to drain a lot of reserves first and then ra ise the IOER rate, but we may decide to do the reverse. So I think we need to have  a thorough discussion about that issue. In terms of the statement, I favor alternativ e B.  I’m with pretty much everyone else.  We’re withdrawing quite a bit of  accommodation, frankly, as we taper off the asset-purchase programs and phase out most of the liquidity facilities over the next few months.  We don’t really know how important liquidity facilities ar e in terms of their back stop function, so until we actually take them away, we’re not really going to know exactly how much accommodation is being withdrawn. I think the “extended period” language still works.  I thought it was interesting that the primary dealer poll suggested that , if you keep it in, then it’s goi ng to be at least three more meetings before the Fed might tighten.  Obvious ly, it’s actually four, be cause you would take it out potentially at the next meeting, and then there would be three more meetings after that.  So that fits pretty well with the informal poll that I talked about at the last  meeting, where “extended period,” in my view, was at least six months.  So I’m glad to see that the dealers are on the same As far as President Kocherlakota’s suggesti on on holdings, I’m uncomfo rtable with that.  Here’s the reason why: I unders tand what you’re driving at, that there is this question of redemptions.  But “holdings” suggests a two-side dness that “purchases” doe s not.  I think if you put “holdings” in there, you’re inadvertently going to raise the question of wh ether asset sales are now on the table in a much more assumed way than  what we might want to imply there.  So I think that’s the problem with it.  I understand the motivation, but “purchases” is one-sided, “holdings” is not.  135 of 247Finally, on the new issue of CMBS, I know that’s a decision for the Board.  I think that in the relatively near future the Board does need to clarify with the mark et, though, whether that’s going to be extended or not extend ed.  There’s a pretty long runw ay for people to develop that and bring it to market, so I woul d say by late January or early Fe bruary it would be useful to clarify whether that’s going to go away or whethe r that is going to be extended beyond June 30.  Thank you. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you very much.  As usual, it was a very informative and diverse discussion. Let’s talk a bit very broadly. We’re going to come back in January and talk a lot about tactics. Let me just address for a moment this broad question:  Is policy too easy or too tight at this juncture?  You know, there is a fairly s ubstantial view out ther e—Paul Krugman and Joe Gagnon, for example, have expressed it—that by the Taylor Rule we are still several hundred basis points too tight, that we s hould, therefore, be doing a lot more  asset purchases.  President Yellen, I think, was alluding to that .  So I think there is a respect able view which says that we should be looking to ease further ra ther than to be tightening.  Th e reason I personally, at least, am not convinced that that’s the right way to go is that the connection between what actions we can take at this point and effec tive easing in the markets is not at  all clear.  For example, on the one hand, mortgage rates are already extraordinarily low—it’s not clear that we can lower them much more.  And there are certainly risks associat ed with substantial further expansion of asset purchases, including destabilizing inflation expectations, causing co mmodity prices to rise, or causing the dollar to start to fall, all of which c ould lead to a reaction which would be actually a net negative. So while I see mer it in the idea that we should, in some sense, be at an easier    136 of 247stance than we are, I think we are, in fact, getting to the point where the connection between our tools and the state of the financial co nditions is becoming much less clear. That being said, I have listened to Presiden t Bullard now for three or four meetings, and even I can begin to hear that after a while.  [Laughter] I thin k that we should not rule out additional purchases. We might want to consid er a program of modest purchases, which could be varied, and consider doing that in a wa y that’s responsive to broad conditions and, specifically, to something that we ’ll learn a lot more about in th e next few months, namely, what happens to the mortgage rate and the housing mark et after our purch ases end.  So I think that’s something we want to keep in mind as we think about our broad strategy. Should we do less, as an alternative? I think it’s good for confidence and good for predictability for us to begin to normalize policy,  to begin to operate in  a way that people are more familiar with.  We are coming to the point where we can do that, and I view this closing of some of these facilities as being an important st ep.  I don’t think that act ually tightening policy is a good idea, for the reasons I just said. I think th at the economy is still quite weak and that we should not, at this point, either tighten or strongly signal a tig htening at this juncture.   The signaling is very important. For example,  relative to President Lacker’s and others’ suggestion about cutting back slightly on our purchases, the $100 b illion here and there is small change, as far the magnitudes are concerned.  President Plosser is ho lding his forehead.  [Laughter] What’s far more importa nt in this context is the signa ling.  What are we saying?  Are we saying, therefore, that we have decided to be gin a process of tightenin g?  I worry much more about the signals than I do about the actual purchases at this point, and so I think we have to be very, very careful.  137 of 247I do think that what we are doing has been quite  constructive.  Regarding these side risks of the dollar and excess speculati on and so on, while we have to monitor those carefully, at the moment I think those things look, as  best we can tell, to be all ri ght.  And therefore, again, given the state of the economy, I don’t think we shoul d be actively signaling a tightening process at this point. I would note—despit e the commentary of the dealer s about three meetings and so on—that in the previous forward guidance episode we changed the statement about considerable period, and two meetings later we ra ised interest rates.  I mean, it was a meeting of intermediate language, and then the next meeting we raised rate s.  So I don’t think th at we’re constrained to six months by any means. So my general preference is alternative B, with maintaining, importantly, the “extended period” language for the time being, trying to minimize changes that would be viewed as premature signals, either of tighten ing or ease, and that’s  a very important aspect of the language. But, at the same time, I think what we do want to signal is normalizati on as much as possible, that we are exiting from extraordinary facilitie s where we can, and that we hope that it will inspire confidence that we are moving towards more normal policy. Let me talk a little bit about some of the specifics that we re raised in the language.  I think there is a good bit of support for President Fisher’s idea in  paragraph 1 about staffing.  I didn’t focus on it today, but, in fact , in last November’s statement, the sentence “Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investme nt,” also said “and staffing.”  We cut that phrase for this meeting’s statement.  So it does seem appropria te to say that, even though we’re not seeing further declines in employment, we’re not seeing hiring either.  So, how do es it go?  “Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower place, but remain reluctant to expand payrolls.” Is that what we have? 138 of 247MR. KOHN. And, I thin k you could say “and.” 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. “And remain reluctant to expand.”  Is that the right word— was suggested? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Add to payrolls. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. “Still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace, and remain reluctant to expand payroll.”  Right? 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Don, you had the best words, I think. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. What  were your words, Don? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I said “add to payrolls.” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. “Add to payrolls”? MR. KOHN. Yes. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All right,  that’s a little better.   On the inflation sentence, I think there should be a barrier to make cha nges.  I understand that several people have preferences for the language in C.  I think some place where we might head at some point would be to combine those two.  For example, if we wa nt to retain the reference to resource slack—this is just a suggestion for the future, I’m not going to propose this right now—we could say something like “With substantial re source slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures, and with longer-term inflation expectations stable ,”—then the second part of the C—“the Committee expects that with appropriate monetary adjustments inflation will remain at levels consistent,” and so on. So that’s a direction we could consider.  I’d  note that one issue is that making that change today would constitute a change in our inflation forecast, and I don’t think it really has changed from inflation being subdued  to being consistent with price stability.  It seems that that would be a natural step to take when inflation risks and levels a nd forecasts seem closer to the   139 of 2472 percent target. So my recommendation, based on “less change is gene rally better,” would be not to make that change today, but to recognize that going forward that reference to monetary policy actions and price stability woul d be perhaps a constructive direction. Regarding the third paragraph, I appreciate the thrust of President Kocherlakota’s suggestion, and I think we do have to think a bout—again, as President Bullard has suggested— how we might do additiona l purchases, and, if so, how we can  do that in a way that’s more responsive to incoming data.  That being sai d, I share the Vice Chairman’s concern that switching to the word “holdings” at this point is going to be jumping the gun, in the sense of being too strongly suggestive that we can adjust the portfolio either up or down.  And we have not yet, I think, come to any kind of conclusion or agreement about how we’re going to deal with asset sales, that is, what prior ity or what order they would have.  So I’m reluctant, for that reason, to do that. But, again, this, like Gove rnor Warsh’s “portfolio” comment, is a suggestion, a direction, that we’re going to want to go toward as we have  greater clarity among ourselves about how we want to manage our balance sheet. Several people objected to paragraph 4, but  I thought the consensus mostly was to include that—again, as a symbol  of our exit.  The one question I would put before the group would be the sentence on the TALF.  We could simply drop that sentence, if there is interest in doing that. Brian, would that be a lacuna that would be troubling?  We’re not referring to some of our other actions or programs. 

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN. I think that presumably would be interpreted simply as “the Federal Reserve has nothing new to report for the TALF.”    140 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So, for those who are concerned that paragraph 4 is too strong a signal, or who are concer ned specifically about CMBS, that might help in that direction.  President Evans.  

[SECTION]

MR. EVANS. Haven’t we already a nnounced these dates tentatively? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We have announced them. 

[SECTION]

MR. EVANS. I guess the question is the percep tion would be if you sort of ratify some dates but not the others is that a signal that— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I’m just putting it forward for the group’s consideration.  The difference is that the language  here, “anticipated expiration da tes,” is a somewhat different sense from the previous announcement, which was th at it’s being “extended to.”  There is some information there in terms of the likelihood of a continuation of  this program, but, personally, I’m fine either way. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, I thin k Janet’s point was that we not consider the last sentence boilerplate, that  we are serious about it, and that we will adjust if needed.  Wasn’t that your point? 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Actually, she wa s talking about paragraph 3. 

[SECTION]

MS. YELLEN. Actually, I was talking about pa ragraph 3.  The same applies here.  It’s just that the time for putting togeth er these deals is so long that to wait until anything close to 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We take the point th at the Board needs to think about this very soon. And one can argue that this langu age does not preclude, obviously, extensions—it says anticipated expiration date—the last se ntence says “prepared to modify,” and so on. 

[SECTION]

MR. TARULLO. Richard suggests a parenthetical  saying this is not boilerplate, this is—     141 of 247MR. FISHER. No, no, [laughter]. To be accurate, I would amend the last sentence to say, “The Federal Reserve is pr epared—honest to God, really, a nd we mean it”—[laughter]—“to modify these plans.” I would not be in favor  of taking that penulti mate sentence out, Mr. Chairman. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. I think we should not take it out, because I think listing all the programs that we’ve done and omitting this  one would be noticed, and it mi ght be noticed in a significant way—I think that’s what President Evans was saying.  So unless we really intend to do something different, I think it would be a mistake not to include it. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. My sense is that it would be interpre ted that something is—  

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Some thing’s afoot, right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All right. Under President Fisher’s suggestion, we’ll put the last sentence in bold. [L aughter]  We’re nodding—this is wo rrisome here.  [Laughter] Is that acceptable? All right. My proposal, then, is to make th e change about hiring in the first paragraph, and to make no additional changes to alternative B, noting for the future that we will want to consider modification of paragraph 3, the descripti on of our portfolio, and that all of these things appropriately should be part of our discussion of strategy and tact ics, which we have promised and we now have to deliver for January. President Lockhart. MR. LOCKHART. This may be too fine a poi nt, but I have a thought about the use of the phrase “adding to payrolls.” In light of the increas e of temporary worker s, I am wondering if the business community thinks when they add temp s, or they add contract workers, they are     142 of 247adding to payrolls, when what we ’re trying to say is they’re not adding permanent hires, which is the fine distinction. 

[SECTION]

MR. FISHER. That’s why I used the word “ove rhead” originally, but I think it’s too fine a point. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, of course, in  the November report, even including temporary hires it was still a negative number. 

[SECTION]

MR. LOCKHART. Right. But we are getting an ecdotal feedback that there’s a sort of sequence—you add hours, then you add temps, and then ultimately you add permanents.  And we are getting anecdotal feedback that there has b een a pickup in temporaries.  I just raise it to make sure we are communicating what we want. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. I think it says “remain reluctant,” so  isn’t that what we’ve said?  It’s not as if they’re not doing it, but th ey’re being very cautious about it, so I think it’s okay. 

[SECTION]

MR. LOCKHART. Fair enough. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any other comments?  [No response.]  All right. Brian, are you prepared to read the changes? 

[SECTION]

MR. MADIGAN. There’s just one change, Mr. Chairman.  My understanding is that we’re adding to the fourth sentence at the end of  the first clause anothe r clause, so after the words “slower pace” we add, comma, “and remain reluctant to add to payrolls” and then semi­colon. There are no other changes to altern ative B as it appears on page 3.  Also, the Committee’s vote will be covering the directive on page 8 of the handout. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. And we w ill have further discussion dealing with redemptions going forward.  On that issue, for example, in my July Wall Street Journal  editorial about our exit strategy, I explicitly noted what the redempti on expectations were for the next   143 of 247couple of years. I noted that  between $100 and $200 billion a year would roll off, and I included that as part of my description of how we would exit.  So it isn’t an entire surprise in that respect.  If there are no other questions, we ’re prepared to take a roll. 

[SECTION]

MR. LUECKE. As Brian indicated, this vot e will cover the direc tive on page 8 of the handout and the statement on page 3 with  the modifications that Brian read. Chairman Bernanke Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Duke  Yes President Evans  Yes Governor Kohn  Yes President Lacker  Yes President Lockhart  Yes Governor Tarullo  Yes Governor Warsh  Yes President Yellen   Yes 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you very mu ch.  Why don’t we take a 15-minute coffee break and come back for the special presentation? [Coffee break] 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let me call on Je ff Fuhrer who will introduce the special  topic. Jeff. 

[SECTION]

MR. FUHRER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In thinking about how to introduce this topic this morning I was tempted to  extend the Titanic metaphor of yesterday afternoon. Were I to do that, I might note that First Officer Wilcox and Ensign Sheets had left the Committee in the middle of the frigid North Atlantic, clinging to flimsy life boats, while the sharks of high unemp loyment and highly uncertain inflation circled hungrily. Fortunately, the intrepid crew of the R.M.S. Carpathia, headed by officers Michael Dotsey from Philadelphi a, Mark Wynne from Dallas, and Jeff Fuhrer from Boston, were steaming their way to extricate the Committee from its rather precarious circumstances.  However, I chose not to extend that metaphor.  [Laughter] Further, in part, because, unlik e Batman, who seems to have an endless supply of tools in his utility belt to take car e of any circumstances that might arise in Gotham City, we don’t actually have any such tools to extricate you from your predicament.  So, I will move on and leave that belabored metaphor alone.          144 of 247In weighing the options for monetary polic y in the coming years, inflation plays a pivotal role. If inflation st abilizes at its recent level a nd then rises gradually to the Committee’s implicit goal, while unemployment  declines towards a rate consistent with full employment over the same horiz on, many will consider this an acceptable outcome.  If, on the other hand, inflation c ontinues to decline in the presence of elevated unemployment, falling more signi ficantly below the Committee’s goal, then the Committee’s policy decisions could become much more complicated. Which of these outcomes materializes will depend on what determines inflation in the short run. So what does determine infla tion?  In answering this question, I am reminded of one of my favorit e stories, which involves Sigmund Freud and one of his graduate students (and which is probably  entirely apocryphal).  The student was troubled about Freud’s theory that all dreams reflect wish fulfillment.  She had a recurrent dream in which she murder ed her young children, and she found it impossible to believe that this dream reflected her wishes.  When she posed this dilemma to Freud, he thought for a moment and replied, “But don’t you see that your dream simply reflects your wish to disprove my theories?”  [Laughter] Like Freud, economists love to be clev er, and also like Freud, our deep and abiding love of our own theories may make it difficult for us to see their flaws.  In considering the possible traj ectory of inflation, I believe  we should contemplate the alternatives with un-Freud-like humility.  The fact is that we don’t know what will happen to inflation.  In recent years, infla tion has certainly fluctuated, but it has been quite stable by the standards of the 1970s and 1980s.  It appears to have been so far only modestly responsive to the significant declines in  employment, activity, and labor costs. And, while short-run inflation expectations have ge nerally tracked short-run movements in inflation, some measures of long-run expectations have remained remarkably stable.  As a consequence, it is  difficult to know whether inflation in this turbulent period will respond to economic conditions as it did in the turbulent 1970s and 1980s, or instead remain placid in the wake of recent and ongoing upheaval, taking on the imperturbable, s phinx-like demeanor that was characteristic of inflation in the period that we now fondly re member as The Great Moderation.  Our goal today, then, is not to provide evidence that irrefutably explains how inflation has behaved and where it must go, but instead to impose a degree of rigor on the discussion, to raise questions based on our  best theoretical a nd empirical analysis, and, most importantly, to spark a discussion among the principals at  this table that will help us better understand each of our imperfect frameworks for thinking about inflation. And in that regard, I would just note that, at breakfast this morning, such a discussion started to emerge—a rather engaging, interactive discussion about some of the issues that we’ll talk about today.  So I’m hoping that maybe some of that sense will spill over to the discussion this morn ing.  Now let me turn it over to Mike Dotsey, who will make the first presentation.                                                        4 The materials used by Mr. Dotsey are appended to this transcript (appendix 4). 145 of 247MR. DOTSEY.4  Thanks, Jeff.  Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, our presentation summarizes two important concepts: inflation persistence and output gaps. These seemingly disparate concepts are linked through the Phillips curve.  We  argue that interpretations  of inflation persistence a nd output gaps derived from  Phillips curve models are sensitive to assu mptions made in estimating these models and assumptions made about the nature of shocks entering the models.  Unfortunately, there is not always a sound basis for choosing among candidate assumptions.  As a result, basing policy discussions on measures of persistence or output gaps may not  be productive. Our work shows that: (1) observed infl ation persistence may be the result of monetary policy choices and thus cannot be us ed to infer structural features of the economy; (2) statistical measures of output gaps are not  useful in formulating monetary policy; and (3) theo retical measures of output gaps may in principle be helpful for guiding policy, but in practice they are probably not. Let me turn my attention to my first topi c, inflation persistenc e.  To investigate the potential sources of inflati on persistence, we used a simp le sticky price model.  In this model, the New Keynesian Phillips cu rve accounts for deviations of inflation from average, or trend, inflation.  In looki ng at inflation over th e last 50 years, it appears that inflation can be characterized  as a process having a time-varying mean.  Thus, how one models trend inflation has im portant implications for the structure of the model.  If trend inflation is changing over time and is modeled as changing over time, then the New Keynesian Phillips curv e needs to account only for the deviations of inflation from a changing trend, not fo r overall inflation.  Thus, a New Keynesian Phillips curve estimated on deviations from trend inflation will predict less backward-looking indexation or shock persistence.  Ther e will be fewer struct ural rigidities than if the trend is depicted as a constant. To clarify the sources of inflation pers istence, consider the reduced-form New Keynesian Phillips curve on page 3 of the ha ndout.  This equation indicates that there are several potential sources of inflation pe rsistence.  Inflation can be persistent because marginal cost is persistent, because markup shocks are persistent, because prices are indexed to past infl ation, or because the inflation trend is itself persistent.  It seems natural to interpret a time-varying inflation trend as the result of a drifting inflation target.  We estimate our simple model for two sp ecifications of the inflation trend, a specification with a fixed inflation target a nd a specification with an inflation target that follows a random walk.  We find that allowing for a random walk inflation target reduces the overall contribution of inde xation and markup shocks to inflation persistence. Further, the random walk infl ation target specifica tion is statistically preferred to the constant  target specification.         146 of 247That finding implies that the persisten ce of inflation is, to a large degree, determined by policy.  Supporting this point is  the observation that historically across countries inflation persistence depends on the monetary regime.  In particular, inflation persistence is lower in countries  that are on a gold st andard or where the central bank targets inflation. The findi ng that inflation persistence is largely determined by monetary policy and that other sources of persis tence are not very important implies that policy is fully capable  of changing the behavior of inflation without generating large economic costs, especi ally if inflation e xpectations are well anchored. Now let me turn to my second topic, th e usefulness of output gaps for conducting monetary policy. We are going to conclude th at they are not very useful.  Broadly speaking, output gaps refer to the deviati on of output from a level deemed to be desirable. Thus, constructing an output gap requires one to take a stand on the desired level of output, often referred to as  potential output.  There are two primary approaches to defining and measuring poten tial output:  those based on statistical procedures and those based on explicit theore tical models.  Statis tical measures of potential output are constr ucted either as smoothed m easures of actual output or smoothed estimates of output deri ved from a production function. A second approach to constructing potentia l output relies on es timated theoretical models, where the behaviors of output and potential output depend on the structure of the economy and the exogenous shocks buffeting the economy.  Some  features of the economy’s structure and some of the shocks  hitting the economy may give rise to inefficient outcomes.  For example, monopo listic price setting a nd nominal rigidities introduce distortions. In addition, markup s hocks introduce inefficient fluctuations.  This suggests defining potential output as that output that could be obtained in the absence of distortions and in efficient shocks, but including the effects of shocks that are classified as efficient.  In simple versions of these models, a monetary policy that minimizes the difference between actual ou tput and the model-based definition of potential output, that is, the model- based output gap, is welfare improving. Thus, in principle, model-based output gaps  may be useful for policy purposes.  In contrast, the statistical measures of the output gap are less useful for policy purposes, because these measures need not be closely related to model-based gaps.  For example, in figure 1 of the handout we c onsider a productivity increase in an economy with sticky nominal prices.  With  sticky prices, output responds more sluggishly than it would if prices were flex ible.  Because of this , potential output rises by more than actual output, and the theoretical output gap is  negative.  However, if we were to graph a statistical measure of  potential, which is a smoothed version of actual output, it would rise  by less than actual output, producing a positive output gap. Thus the model-based output gap a nd the statistical-bas ed output gap would move in opposite directions and imply diffe rent monetary policy responses.  This example illustrates why we think it unwise to base policy on statistical-based gaps.           147 of 247However, at this stage of model devel opment, we are also uncomfortable with using model-based gaps for policy purposes.  First, in more complicated models, the output gap is no longer a suffici ent statistic for evaluating the welfare implications of monetary policy. Moreover, the models ar e still preliminary.  In addition, shocks play an important quantitative role in thes e models, but the econo mic interpretation of many of these shocks is unclear. While we have come to accept productivity shocks as structural, we have not yet reached that comfort level w ith many of the new “structural” shocks coming out of New Keynesian Phillips curve models. It is also of importance that different models may produce very different measures of the output gap. In figure 2 we plot th e output gaps from three representative models. The blue line represents the out put gap from our small-scale model, the green line is the output gap from a me dium-scale New Keynesian Phillips curve model developed by my colleague Keith Sill, and the two red lines represent alternative output gaps from the Board’s la rger-scale EDO model.  It is abundantly clear that the output gaps from these di fferent models are ve ry different.  We, therefore, are not confident that, given th e current state of know ledge, one can rely on model-based gaps as sufficient in dicators for monetary policy. On a more positive note, we believe that the process of formulating and estimating a particular model can be quite useful for policy purposes.  Estimation can inform a policymaker about the shocks th at the model suggest s are impacting the economy.  If the shocks have been correctly  identified, the mode l can be a useful guide to policy. A general lesson from our  models is that it is not enough to know that output is high or low relative to tre nd to conclude that ou tput is high or low relative to potential; rather one needs to know somethi ng about the shocks hitting the economy and the assumed structure of the ec onomy.  It seems more appropriate that policy discussions should proceed based on explicit discussion of these shocks, rather than the implied gaps. From this we conclude that the use of models in policy discussions is beneficial.  Also, because we have no agreed-upon model, it is useful to consider the implications from a number of models, and it is certainl y not necessary that al l the models be of the New Keynesian variety. It is only th e careful consideration of a full range of imperfect models that enlightens and pl aces discipline on policy discussions. In that regard, the Chicago exercise falls into the class of ex ercises that we find productive. They provide a de tailed exposition of their m odel, the various variables constructed using their model, and the cont ribution of shocks to these constructs.  This is consistent with the way we suggest  policy discussions be conducted.  We are, however, more skeptical of the specifics of  their exercise.  They find that their measure of potential output, which conforms to our defi nition of potential, helps explain another model construct that they  call “fundamental inflation.”  We don’t think this is much of a surprise.  Fundame ntal inflation is th e part of detrended                                                         5 The materials used by Mr. Wynne are appended to this transcript (appendix 5). 148 of 247inflation generated by efficient shocks in their model absent inefficiencies and is thus constructed similarly to the way they c onstruct potential outp ut.  That strategy increases the chance that those two constr ucts will be correlated.  However, this correlation is not necessarily useful for policy purposes.  In particular, fundamental inflation is only weakly correlated with actual inflation, implyi ng that their model, like most models, doesn’t provide a good st ructural explanation of inflation.  Therefore, from an academic perspective, thei r results are very interesting, but from a policy perspective less so, because knowing the Chicago measure of potential output tells us very little about ac tual inflation.  This is a key point of the Philadelphia-Richmond presentation.  And now I’ll turn it over to Mark.

MR. WYNNE.5 Thank you, Mike. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, in recent years, a number of monetary policymakers have addressed the question of whether greater global economic  integration, or globalization, has had a significant impact on inflation in the United St ates.  One dimension of this integration is trade in goods and services, and, as fi gure 1 in your handout shows, imports as a share of GDP have gone from just ove r 4 percent during the 1950s and 1960s, to more than 18 percent at the most recent peak.  While there appears to be broad agreement on the importance of globaliza tion as a real phenomenon—that is, as a phenomenon that affects the location and pattern of real economic activity, along with relative prices and real factor returns—th ere is less agreement on what globalization means for inflation dynamics and monetary po licy in a country as large as the United States. On the one hand, there are those w ho argue that the gap concept that is now relevant for thinking about U.S. inflati on is a worldwide measure rather than a domestic one.  On the other hand, there ar e those who argue that, with a flexible exchange rate regime, the effect of forei gn price developments on U.S. inflation is minimal.  Whether greater openness has implicati ons for inflation ove r the medium  to longer term depends very much on how monetary policy responds to these developments.  Globalization does not alter th e fact that, at longer horizons, inflation is ultimately determined by the actions of  monetary policymakers.  Our remarks this morning will focus on the so-called global slack hypothesis, th e notion that, as a result of globalization, the concept of slack  that is most relevant for thinking about short-run tradeoffs between inflation and real activity is global rather than local.  We argue that the global slack hypothesis has analytical content even under a floating exchange rate regime in the context of at least one widely used framework for thinking about inflation dynamics in open ec onomies and, furthermore, is consistent with what we see in the data. The evidence is fragile, to be sure, but it suggests that the hypothesis cannot be dismissed outright. In an open economy, as can be seen in slide 5 of the handout, the final consumption basket will consist of both  domestically produced and foreign produced goods, and consequently the overall rate of  consumer price in flation will be a weighted average of the rate s of increase of the prices of these goods.  When price       149 of 247changes are infrequent and asynchronous, th e rate of change of the prices of domestically produced goods can  be written as a function of the expected future rate of change of these prices a nd the real marginal costs of producing them.  The rate of change of the prices of foreign produced goods sold in the domestic market can be written analogously. Substitution of these relationships into the domestic consumer price index then gives us a general expression for the open economy Phillips curve.  Domestic CPI inflation is related to expected future do mestic CPI inflation and a weighted average of domestic and foreign real marginal costs.  By invoking additional assumptions about the labor markets and firms’ pricing behavior, it is possible to rewrite the Phillips curve in a more standard form in terms of domestic and foreign output gaps. And here we need to consider two cases: Suppose that firms that engage in intern ational trade set prices in their own currency and adjust them infrequently. U nder what is referred to as producer currency pricing, the law of one price hol ds and exchange rate pass-through is complete.  In this case, there is a re latively straightforward mapping from real terms of an average of the domestic and fore ign output gaps, as can be seen in slide 6 in the handout. The foreign output gap matters not only as a proxy for foreign influence on domestic pricing decisions. In fact, theory suggests that domestic marginal costs (and, therefore, domestic pr oducer prices) will in general depend on the foreign gap as well because: (a) domes tic firms export their products abroad, so higher foreign demand will force them to pay higher domestic wages; and (b) variations in the terms of trade will af fect their domestic market share and consequently their domestic costs.  Likewi se, foreign marginal costs will depend on foreign as well as domestic output gaps. What if, instead, firms that are engaged in  international trade set prices in the currency of the market to which they are exporting, which is arguably the case for most foreign firms selling in the United States?  Under what is referred to as local currency pricing, the law of one price no l onger holds and exchange  rate pass-through is incomplete.  However, we can still derive an expression for do mestic CPI inflation in terms of domestic and foreign output ga ps, but the Phillips curve now includes an additional expression reflecting the impact of deviations from the law of one price on inflation dynamics.  These deviations, in tur n, can be tied to the easily observable real exchange rate (net of terms of trade effects). Under both assumptions about pricing behavior, the composite coefficients on the domestic and foreign output ga ps are identical functions of  the underlying structural parameters of the model.  Most importantl y, as we show in our background paper, the coefficient on the domestic output gap d eclines as imported goods become more important in the consumption bundle, while the coefficient on the foreign output gap      150 of 247increases; that is, as foreign goods become more important in the consumption bundle, the strength of the relationship be tween the foreign output gap and domestic inflation will increase, while the relati onship between the domestic output gap and domestic inflation will become weaker. Turning now to slide 7, even prior to th e recent flurry of wo rk on globalization, a number of Federal Reserve economists had look ed into the potentia l effect of foreign slack on U.S. inflation. These earlier anal yses generally found that the estimated coefficients on measures of foreign slack  were not statistically significant in traditional backward-looking Phillips curve regressions.  In these earlier studies, the “rest of the world” was usua lly assumed to be the “res t of the G–7.”  Borio and Filardo revived the debate in a widely c ited paper, and they found a statistically significant role for the foreign output gap in  explaining U.S. inflation and a declining role for the domestic output  gap.  Subsequent work by re searchers at the Board of Governors, however, cast doubt on the robustness of these findings. The New Keynesian analytical framework that we use provides an account of inflation dynamics around a possibly time-vary ing steady state.  Hence, when looking for patterns in the data, it seems appropria te to focus on the cyclical components of the variables. If we define the world as  consisting of just the G–7 economies, as much of the older empirical literature had done, ordinary least squares estimates of simple open economy Phillips curve regres sions suggest that there is a more significant relationship, in a statistical sens e, between slack in the other economies of the G–7 and the cyclical component of inflation in the U.S. than there is between slack in the U.S. and inflation in the U.S.   But while the G–7 gr oup still accounts for a significant share of world GDP and of U.S. imports, these shares are declining, as shown on slide 9 in your handout. A more co mprehensive empirical evaluation of the hypothesis would look at a larger group of countries.  Slide 10 in the handout reports some of the results we obtain estimati ng simple versions of our Phillips curve specifications.  For three of the four specifications, the estimated coefficient on the foreign output gap is statistically significant at the 5 percent level and exceeds the estimated coefficient on the U.S. output gap in magnitude.  The evidence is far from overwhelming, to be sure, but it suggests that the idea is worth taking seriously and exploring further. There are a number of possible reasons for the fragility of the evidence, mostly having to do with the conceptual and measurement challenge s associated with estimating Phillips curves in terms of do mestic and foreign output gaps.  But we should note that it is possible to completely eliminate fore ign slack variables from the Phillips curve.  That is, the effects of fore ign slack on domestic inflation can be fully captured in principle by movements in a terms-of-trade gap.  Interestingly, when written this way it turns out that the slope  of the Phillips curve with respect to domestic slack is exactly the same in the open economy and closed economy specifications of the model, as can be  seen in slide 11 in the handout.  The equivalence between these two approaches  to capturing the relationship between                                                          6 The materials used by Mr. Fuhrer are appended to this transcript (appendix 6). 151 of 247foreign slack and domestic inflation also m eans that much of th e earlier empirical work on this issue, including our ow n, probably needs to be reconsidered. To sum up, there are sound analytical a nd empirical reasons for believing that globalization—and, in particular, the greater  openness of the U.S. economy to trade— has had important implications for inflation dynamics.  However, there are well-known conceptual and measurement issues asso ciated with the use of output gaps.  A  terms-of-trade gap can, in principle, captu re the effects of the foreign output gap on domestic inflation developments, but it rema ins to be seen how well a global slack perspective can improve our ability to for ecast inflation and understand the tradeoffs that monetary policy faces.  Jeff will now continue with the staff presentation.

MR. FUHRER.6  I’ll be referring to the third of the three exhibits in your packets.  I just wanted to note before starting that the work I’ll discuss reflects contributions from other people in the room today, in cluding Giovanni Olivei, Wilbert van der Klaauw, and Todd Clark, as well as other ec onomists who couldn’t be with us today. In current discussions regarding the likely trajectory of inflation, two issues loom  large:  first, whether “well-anchored” exp ectations will help to restrain inflation’s an undesirably high rate of in flation; and second, whether an d  to what extent output (or, more generally, resource utilization) gaps are useful components of empirical models of inflation, and, if they are, to wh at extent current gaps will counterbalance the effects of expectations on inflation. framework for modeling inflation.  Some version of this model is in use at virtually all Reserve Banks and the Board; in fact, ve ry little exists in the way of strongly competing frameworks.  As the top left panel of the chart shows, the framework suggests that inflation depends on the expectation of inflation in the next period, the current value of a driving va riable such as marginal co st of production or an output gap, and the inherent inertia in infla tion, captured by dependence on the previous period’s inflation rate. Many other factor s can influence inflation directly and indirectly, but these key elements sit at the center of the fram ework and of recent discussion. The extent to which each of these three factors contributes to the evolution of inflation remain s under considerable debate. The top right panel of that chart high lights an implication of this simple framework.  If the framework is true in th e current period, it holds in the next period as well. If you squint at these two panels for just a few minutes, a nd squint in just the right way, you’ll see that the model boiled down implies that inflation fundamentally depends on current and expected output or ma rginal cost, as noted in the bottom left  panel of the chart. Of cour se, expectations of output depend in part on expectations of monetary policy.  Policy in turn depe nds on the inflation goal, which in this framework may vary over time.  As a cons equence, expectations of monetary policy           152 of 247actions and the monetary authority’s infl ation goal are, not surprisingly, among the determinants of inflation. The bottom right panel of that same exhib it displays the implications that this framework holds concerning which expect ations measures sh ould best explain inflation. Taken together, the simplest featur es of the model in the top left panel and its implications in the next two panels sugge st that short-term inflation expectations matter directly—or, equivalently, that the expectations for output  on average over the medium term matter directly.  Less direc tly, but certainly importantly for this audience, long-run inflation e xpectations should matter, to the extent that they serve as proxies for the central ba nk’s long-run inflation goal. What do “anchored expectations” mean in th is framework?  Your next exhibit, the fourth exhibit, suggests that anchored e xpectations should be interpreted as having two components.  First, the public knows the FOMC’s numerical inflation goal, and second, the public believes that goal is not li kely to change—at le ast, not by much.  As indicated in the exhibit, many believe that the Fed’s inflation goal has changed quite significantly in postwar history, pa rticularly in the 1970s and 1980s.  More recent evidence suggests that public perceptions of the Fed’s goal have changed little in recent years. As shown in your next exhibit, exhibit 5, a carefully constructed econometric estimate of the inflation trend—often interprete d as the public’s perception of the FOMC’s inflation goal—suggests that it has indeed varied over time and that the variation is well proxied by the median SPF 10-year CPI inflation forecast, and that this proxy has been remark ably stable over the past 10 to 12 years.  If this proxy accurately refl ects the relevant expectations , then they are currently well-anchored indeed. We now use a model that incorporates  all these features—well-anchored expectations, some effect of output gaps or marginal cost on inflation, and some effect of lagged inflation—to quantify the ex tent to which, in circumstances such as those we face today, well-anchored exp ectations may serve to offset downward pressures on inflation from dramatic declines  in marginal cost. Your next two exhibits consider such an exercise. In the first case, shown in exhibit 6, exp ectations are purely forward-looking.  The economy starts at a 2 percent in flation rate, that’s the black line in the top panel, with case today for real unit labor costs for th e nonfarm business sector, which are about 8 to 10 percent below their long-run average.  Somewhat opt imistically, I assume that the output gap is only modestly negative.  In these circumstances, the inflation rate, which is shown by the solid black line, falls to a bit below 1 percent, and rises after two to three years to the Fed’s assumed inflation goal of 2 percent, which is depicted by the red line. In the second case, which is shown in your next exhibit, exhibit 7, inflation depends in roughly equal measure on lagge d and expected inflation.  The other         153 of 247features of the simulation are identical, but  the results in this case are dramatically different. Inflation falls si gnificantly below zero, and the funds rate, the dashed black line, is pinned at the zero lower bound for several quarters.   I should emphasize that the coefficient on marginal cost in these simulations is quite small by historical standards. The point is th at one needs only a very small dependence on marginal cost to develop such results. Clearly, the implications for inflatio n in this canonical framework depend critically on the way expectations are fo rmed—purely forward-looking or with some measure of backward-looking influence.  So which is a better description of inflation? Your next exhibit, number 8, outlines an empirical approach to answering this question. We estimate a model that allows  expectations to be determined by any combination of the following measures: the rational or model-consistent expectations employed in the preceding simulations, la gged inflation, and short- and long-term survey expectations, here using the Survey  of Professional Forecasters’ measures.  We allow the contributions of these four expectations proxies to vary over time. Your next exhibit, exhib it 9, presents a simple summary of the results.  On average over the past 30 years, the purely  forward-looking expectations have played at most a modest role in expl aining inflation, and that role appears to have declined in importance in recent years.  Lagged infla tion has played a somewhat larger role historically, although its role has similarl y declined in recent years.  Survey expectations have helped to explain infl ation, and their influence appears to have risen in recent years. I w ould note that the survey meas ures are well-approximated by slow-moving averages of recent inflation, which suggests that they too may “anchor” inflation, as they will lend a slow-moving co mponent to it.  While this might serve to slow the decline of inflation in the face of  significant marginal cost pressure, it will also slow inflation during its  ascent to the Fed’s inflati on goal.  The bottom line of this exercise is that the data suggest th at the very favorable outcome in the purely forward-looking exercise of exhibit 6 is not our best forecast. Your next several exhibits consider what would happen if the public’s inflation expectations were to become unanchored. Note  that the models that we used in the simulations just a moment ago require inflat ion ultimately to rise one-for-one with an increase in long-run inflation expectati ons.  Interestingly, estimates of a less structured empirical model, shown in exhi bit 11, yield the same basic result.  A reasonable interpretation of that result is that when long-run expectations move significantly and persistently, they likely reflect a change in the public’s perception of our inflation goal. Such a shift, if sustaine d, would very likely f eed into inflation over time. Your next exhibit, number 12, considers a potential cause of such a shift in long-run expectations. Based on the same empi rical model, the exhibit examines the response of long-run exp ectations to a decline in core inflation.  The figure suggests that, over the past 25 years, persistent deviations of core inflation from the Fed’s inflation goal have engendered significant movements in long-run expectations.  This      154 of 247exhibit highlights the risk that, in the wake of  declines in core inflation over the past year, long-run expectations could also decl ine.  Together with persistently large output gaps and cost pressures, declining long-run expectations could imply sizable expectations moved pe rsistently higher. Another candidate for spurri ng such an expectations dyna mic is the potential link between inflation expectations and the exp ected path of federal deficits.  The New York Fed conducted a set of surveys to elicit perceptions among consumers and financial experts about the association between future changes in government debt and inflation. Survey responses shown in exhibit 13a indicate that a majority of consumers perceive unexpected increases in  government debt to be inflationary, irrespective of whether unexpect edly high debt is due to a shortfall in tax revenues or higher-than-expected government spending. In a follow-up survey, the scenarios described in the exhibit were expanded by adding specific hypothetical causes for the increase in government spending and shortf all in tax revenues.  These additions had no effect on the response patterns. More over, they are robust across education, income, and financial literacy categories of consumers.  In contrast to consumers, financial expe rts view the scenario in which higher­than-expected debt is due to a shortfall in tax revenues—where a recession is the leading cause for such a scenario—as not inflationary, with 6 out of 11 financial experts associating such condi tions with a decline in inflation.  However, 10 out of 11 financial experts perceive the scenario  in which there is higher-than-expected government spending to be inflationary. Having discussed some ways in which expectations could become unanchored, we now attempt to quantify how unanchored  expectations might affect our outlook for inflation. Exhibit 14 displays a simula tion of the model we discussed earlier in exhibit 7, except in this case the public mistakenly believes the central bank’s inflation goal has risen to 3 percent. The upward pressure that this places on inflation, the black line, is noticeable—inflation does not decline as deeply as in the simulation with anchored expectations.  Th e funds rate, the black dashed line, is pinned at the zero lower bound for a shorter time.  But the Fed’s actions and the course of inflation gradually persuade the public , in this model, at least, that the Fed’s goal is not 3 percent, so the economy return s to its desired stat e of full employment with price stability. Even with unanchored  expectations as characterized in this exercise, very low costs and sizable slack at the onset of the simulation still imply a protracted period of low inflation. All of the Phillips curve models, structur al or reduced-form, old-fashioned or new-fashioned, hinge on the influence of an  activity or cost variable.  Without the influence of such a variable, these relati onships are vacuous and inflation can be indeterminate—there is no channel for mone tary policy to control inflation, and, as suggested in exhibit 3, the relevant expectations have  nothing to anchor them.  Exhibits 15 and 16 examine the issue of wh ether activity gaps have been reliable          155 of 247inflation predictors. Much ink has been spi lled over this issue, so we are unlikely to provide a definitive answer there.  Bu t our empirical work corroborates the commonsense findings of Jim Stock and Mark  Watson, and that is that gaps matter when they’re large, but less noticeably when they are small. The figure in exhibit 16 summarizes th e evidence simply, although it takes a second to orient yourself to it.  Using hi storical data from 1961 to 2009, the figure compares the absolute value of unemploym ent gaps on the vertical axis to the difference between forecast errors from a Phillips curve and a naive statistical model of inflation that does not include the activ ity gap.  The reduction in forecast error provided by incorporating an unemployment gap measure is insignificant when the unemployment gap is near zero, toward th e bottom of the chart.  But, as the magnitude of the gap increases, the forecast error made by the gap-augmented model falls relative to the error from the naive m odel, as indicated by the prevalence of blue diamonds to the left of the vertical axis in the upper half of the chart.  This finding is consistent with the small estimated coefficients on output gaps in Phillips curves for the 1990s and early 2000s and explains the findi ng in some prior research that during those relatively calm times, the naive model predicts infl ation about as well as, or better than, a gap-dependent forecasting model. This is less likely to be the case in current circumstances. What does this empirical finding imply for the current inflati on forecast?  Your next exhibit, number 17, shows that a m odel that incorporates this nonlinearity explains the past several y ears’ inflation data quite well. However, the surge in unemployment over the past year implies a sign ificant decline in inflation to near zero over the next year or so. Thus, the next seve ral quarters will provi de an important test of this model. Finally, we would be remiss if we altoge ther ignored money in a discussion of inflation dynamics. Your final exhibit, wh ich is courtesy of the Minneapolis Fed, displays the correlations between money grow th and inflation at progressively longer horizons from left to right. While thes e correlations do not show causality, many would agree that, over long periods of time, high growth in money is likely to be accompanied by high inflation.  Because such correlations are essentially contemporaneous, they also do not imply that  money can be used to predict future inflation. As the exhibit suggests, M ilton Friedman may now rest in peace. That concludes our prepared remarks.   We’d be happy to take questions. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. First, let me thank the staff for an outstanding effort in putting this all together and, indeed, coordinatin g among different Reserve Banks.  We now have an opportunity for questions or comments.  Let me  start with a question for you, Mike.  You talk   156 of 247about statistical models of gaps, but I think th ey look to be mostly constructed from single- variable analysis, looking only at GDP.  Take your example with the productivity shock—if you also looked at, say, productivity  or unemployment and so on, you would get more information, and you might be able to identify the shock in that case.  So wouldn’t a multivariable analysis reduce some of your concern about statistic al models? 

[SECTION]

MR. DOTSEY. I really can’t answer that. I haven’t done that research, and I haven’t looked into that. I don’t know if Andreas, who’s also with me t oday, has anything he could add. 

[SECTION]

MR. HORNSTEIN. The short answer, to be honest,  is yes.  For this particular example, the way it’s structured, you rely on price rigidities.  So with a pr oductivity increase, output is not going to move so much and employment contracts.   A particular example would predict that if you look at more information, you might reassess what you think about the gap.  On the other hand, the way these gaps are us ually constructed, you generate the trend output path—you don’t use that kind of information. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker. MR. LACKER. Mr. Chairman, if you take the model as a maintained assumption, it tells you how to calculate the gap, and you do use all those variables.  So when they talk about model- generated gaps, that’s exactly what they’re talking about .  I think the difficulty arises, as their memo and the Chicago one illustrate, in that diff erent models give you different estimates of the gap, and different estimates of how productivity shocks affect what you regard as— 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I thought the point was if you look at just the path of GDP and you took a quadratic trend or something out of that and looked at residuals, the gaps you would construct that way would not be necessa rily economically meaningful for reasons we understand.     157 of 247MR. LACKER. In a statistical atheoretical model.  Right. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. But if you believed in their m odel, then productivity and unemployment data would help you identify gaps in their model—which is not a bizarre model; it’s similar to a lot of others. Questions or comments? President Kocherlakota. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I was impressed with all of the papers. It was obvious that a lot of work went  into them, and I’m very appreciative of that. I wanted to talk about two messages I took aw ay from the Philadelphia–Richmond paper.  It’s more commentary than questions.  One is th e discussion that President Lacker and Chairman Bernanke were just having about the difference between old thinking and new thinking, or old Keynesian and New Keynesian models, about gaps.  I think this difference is  that just looking at a statistical trend as a way to figure out what potential output is or effi cient output is can be misleading.  Just to cite the current example, out put right now is about 8 percent below trend as measured from December 2007.  The question is: How much of this fall is efficient?  How much of this represents a deviation from potentia l output?  The theme that comes out of the Philadelphia–Richmond paper—and it’s basically a theme of all work on monetary economics for the last 15 years—is that there’s really no way to answer this question without a model. The second message that comes out of this pape r is that measuring an output gap can be hard. I think that, at times, the paper, or the presentation, seems to imply that this is somehow a new problem with New Keynesian modeling when, in fact, it’s pretty much an old problem, which is true in all economics—we can come up with observationally equivalent models that, in this case, will give rise to different measures of  output gaps and then di fferent implications of optimal policy.  I think the Chicago paper points th is out—that this is not something special to 158 of 247the New Keynesian approach to thinking about monetary economics, but rather it’s something that’s present in all macroeconomic models. In fact, I think the New Keynesian approach ac tually helps us with thinking about sorting across models because it brings so much more auxiliary information to bear compared to older approaches; for example, it requires consiste ncy between household-level and firm-level expectations and observed data, and there’s consistency between asset pricing and firm investment decisions.  All of thes e kinds of restrictions are valuab le sources of information that make it easier to use data to distinguish among ex isting models.  The point is that I think the Philadelphia–Richmond paper is right that these newer models don’t fully solve this identification problem—what are output gaps, what ’s the right thing to do at any given moment in time? I think there are two parts to trying to respond to this problem. One is that we use a wide range of models, and this is something you see in  the Bluebook—several models are considered.  We might even think of expanding that range of  models.  And then there’s supplementing that with good judgment, which is what the Chicago mem o, I think, is trying to argue; that is, if we bring enough good judgment to bear, we can actually  sort through some of these issues.  That can be very helpful. The second part, which is something th at’s more common in other parts of macroeconomics, is to use microdata as an auxiliary source of information beyond macrodata.  The EDO model, which is used at the Board, is one step in this directi on because it uses sector- level data, but there are lots of other kinds of micr olevel data that can be very informative.  For example, there’s this issue about whether or not inflation is backwa rd-looking, that is, for example, whether, when firms set prices, they look backwards or not in terms of indexation.    159 of 247Well, we have lots of microdata on price setting. Mark Bills at the University of Rochester and Pete Klenow at Stanford University have basica lly spent the last decade on this issue.  The ECB has commissioned studies in a wide range of countrie s to do this in Europe.  It would be great to supplement some of our thinking about just build ing aggregate-level models with information from microlevel data.  Likewise, a lot of times the questions hinge on these latent or unobservable things in the macro model which we  could actually try to get information about from microlevel data, for example, questions ab out firm financing costs, questions about the what’s in the macro models. So by and large, I like the Philadelphia–Ri chmond paper and presentation, but I think they came across as far too negativ e about the state of play.  I th ink that we’ve made enormous progress in the last ten years in bringing models to  bear that are useful for policy analysis, while at the same time they embed the ingredients of  modern macroeconomics that have been proven useful in other contexts.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No, you’re next. MR. EVANS. All right.  I’m a little reluctant to interven e so early because I have a series of rants that I could go on. [Laughter] And I apologize for that. Regarding your question, Mr. Chairman, I th ink you put your finger on one of the things that bothered me.  But, first off, I thought this  was a terrific set of papers, and, they’re very helpful as we think about these issues.  I think the papers expose a number of Committee  160 of 247members to a different type of discussion, one that economists tend to have, which you may or I thought the Philadelphia–Rich mond critique of statisti cal gap measures and New Keynesian models was just a littl e too mechanical and didn’t repr esent how we actually use these measures in this room.  They had the exam ple of a beneficial productivity shock and a sticky-price model. If everybody followed that, their analysis says that, after a positive productivity shock we’ll get a pos itive statistical output  gap.  We’ll see that  output goes up, but the trend is going to be smoother and so it’s positive,  while, in fact, what is actually taking place is that potential is a lot higher and output only went up by this mu ch.  So it’s a negative type of gap. And if all we’re looking at is the output gap, as Mike properly noted, we’re going to mechanically make a mistake. But the question is: Have we ever gone through this?  We have.  The Greenspan Fed lived through this during the s econd half of the 1990s.  The debate between irrational exuberance and a once-in-a-generation productivity accelerat ion was squarely put on the table in those discussions, and, in the end, th e productivity argument carried  the day, and policy did not erroneously tighten. How did we end up there?   Well, Chairman Greenspan and the Committee dismissed looking only at single measures.  I’m so rry Dave Stockton isn’t here, because that was very uncomfortable as Chairman Greenspan would say, “Phillips curve—no, no, no, we don’t want to look at that. Capacity, no, no, no.”  And nobody could quite figure out exactly which resource slack measure he wanted to look at, but he was looking at resource slack.  He used other information beyond the comparison of actual output w ith a simple trend.  So if we think about the productivity shock example in the Philadelp hia–Richmond memo, in a sticky-price model, because output cannot expand to poten tial, labor input is going to fall.  This comes out of all the  161 of 247model simulations.  Ellen McGrattan has papers where you see that fr om this type of shock.  So labor slack is negative. What about inflation signals?  A positive statis tical gap relative to a linear trend would call for upward price pressure, so we’d be worried about inflation picking up. But in fact, in the model, the true output gap is negative and th ere’s downward pressure  on inflation because such downward cost factors. We were paying atte ntion, and we did not get caught up in just this single output gap measure.  Fundamentally, we scratch our heads when we have different measures that don’t line up.  That’s  a real-time warning, and we tr y to reconcile these conflicting signals. We look at our models and our assump tions more closely.  Just think about how the Greenbook gives us a good view on structural productivity—each Greenbook, which is more often than we really need it because it doesn’t change that much—but st ill, that’s quite good.  And then there’s other anecdotal information.  Chairman Greenspan kept saying—and I know I didn’t understand it when he first said it—that we heard plenty of business reports of higher productivity and earnings analysts’ five-year-ahead  forecast smoothed were telling us something and that turned out to be right. So the bottom line is that we live d through an example that’s like the most troubling example in the paper, and I think we passed it.  So that was pretty good. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I guess it was a pro ductivity episode also in the jobless recovery after 2001 where we saw unemployment high relative to output—somewhat similar. President Lacker. MR. LACKER. Thank you. I just want to sketch out how I see these presentations related to past discussions we’ve had, as President Evans did.  I’ve often sensed some intuitive hurdles to consensus here. At th is end of the table, some participants have argued that you ought 162 of 247to think of the gap differently from the unemploym ent rate relative to 5 percent or so.  That intuition—that the gap has to be really big right now with unemployment at 10 percent comes from this earlier way of thinking about macroecono mics that President Kocherlakota referred to.  We had macroeconomic models that were essentially static (the static part isn’t important for this purpose), but they weren’t growth models, and they were grafted on a deterministic growth model, and the idea was that the deterministic  growth model gave you a benchmark of what output and activity could be and what inflation could be, and then macroeconomics was about deviations from a deterministic growth model. We faced that, and there was this challenge of integrating the two.  We didn’t know how, and we know how now. The way we integrate growth and fluctuations is the stochastic growth model, and that provides an internally consistent, coherent understanding of the determinants of growth and fluctuations. So we don’t need to rely on this ad hoc marrying of two different, disparate models. When I think about gaps, I always want to start from scratch.  I want to say, “All right, let’s take a model and let’s pretend you don’t kn ow what a gap is or you don’t know how a gap is defined. Let’s look at infla tion dynamics.  Does the difference between output and some other counterfactual output appear in th at equation?  And let’s look at optimal policy, and does the difference between output and some other counte rfactual output appear in optimal policy?” When you do that in these stochastic growth models, what you get is the counterfactual with which you should compare out put to figure out what infla tion is going to do and what policy should be. It’s something that responds to shocks.  That’s the basic lesson I get out of this class of models that Mike Dotsey was talking about, unlike the deterministic growth model where the benchmark counterfactual output everyone was thinking about is something that, 163 of 247because it comes from the deterministic growth  model, does not respond to shocks; so you can estimate it easily with an exponential functi on of time into a smooth statistical trend. The thing to remember here is that it’s marg inal cost, and it’s just  this use of production functions to get to an output ga p that gives us the ability to wr ite these modern inflation dynamic models in terms of output gaps—he nce my facetious suggestion to s ubstitute real marginal cost for resource slack in the statement.  Another way to look at this intuiti on is to think about a 6 percent unemployment rate in Ja nuary of 2010.  That seems preposterously unlikely.  It seems that it would be really hard for us to engineer po licy coming out of this m eeting to get that.  But if you’re having trouble understanding an output gap or a potentia l that moves down a lot in a recession, think about why you don’t think we coul d achieve a 6 percent unemployment rate in the first quarter. It would be rea lly costly to employ all of those resources.  It’s that the marginal cost is kind of high now—it’s not as low as you would think by just looking at the gap.  That’s the intuition, I think, for this ot her way of thinking about what counterfactual level of output or activity ought to be your reference in thinking about inflation dynamics. I want to say a word building on what Presid ent Kocherlakota obser ved about the use of models in policy. Dotsey et al. conclude that these models are not quite ready for use in policy, and I’d qualify that. To paraphr ase Churchill, they’re not quite ready for po licy, except that all other models are less ready for policy than these mode ls are.  I think it’s fair to say that this broad class of models is the only game in town now.  What most pe ople have said is that further approximations to reality are all going to be extens ions of, elaborations of , this broad class of models where there is price setting with price stickiness, and that’s where the real nominal interaction comes from.  164 of 247Within a model, you can answer these things re ally tightly.  So you’ve  got to step back and look at a range of plausible models that, as President Kocher lakota points out, fit the data roughly equally well and decide what to do. If you don’t look at models, you’re still using a model, because you’ve got an implicit model in your head.  It’s kind of like axiomatic choice theory, right?  You’re acting as if you have a model in your head if you’re making a choice.  Being explicit about which models you unders tand and you’re relying on seems obviously preferable to an approach where you don’t fo rmalize those things and don’t tie down your insights or your intuition with the kind of internal coherence that President Kocherlakota described. I’ll make a final point.  Except for the case of purely backward-looking inflation expectations, the models depict us as in an e quilibrium in which we are following, have always followed, and will always continue to follow a fixed rule, a fixed mapping from economic circumstances to what we choose.  Maybe there’s some drift in it over time,  but that’s the basic framework, so at all times you’ve got to look at a gap.  But, then, what does it tell you about policy?  What does it tell you about  what it’s going to take to fo llow through on that rule in order to maintain the consistency of inflation e xpectations with what you would like to see maintained?  That’s a key question. Sometimes  the gap doesn’t say as much about that.  Sometimes I sense a large gap being adduced as evidence that we can pause for a long time, and it’s not obvious that that’s the case.  It’s not obvious that our policy rule doesn’t build in a different response. So that’s just my effort to  tie this back to discussions we’ve had around this table. I compliment the authors.  I learned someth ing from all three of them, and I’m grateful for their efforts.     165 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Lacker, th e only thing that puzzles me in what you said is the implication that we don’t use models.  We do use models. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. We do. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. And alternative models.  The staff uses both large macro models that try to deal with aggregation and comp lexity, and they use smaller models.  I think, as you say, there’s only one model in town.  I don’ t think you can write down a Keynesian model that doesn’t have a ro le for gaps in it. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. I didn’t mean to imply that  you or the Board staff don’t use models. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Okay. MR. EVANS. Could I make a comment? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Evans has a two-hander. MR. EVANS. This is a line of commentary th at I don’t always follow, that the gap is somehow a special variable, an endogenous va riable.  In the context of writing down an equilibrium model, you could write—I’m pretty sure  this is true—the equilibrium decision rules, which are a function of the relevant state variab les, which could be transformed so that the output gap captures that  part of it.  That would say th at, given our policy response function parameters, this is how everything responds to th e gap, and we’re following through on it.  So it requires art to know how we should be responding to  those things, but it’s  not prima facie wrong. 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. I’m not sure what you’re saying. MR. EVANS. When we say the output gap looks like this and so I think that policy ought to respond in this fashion b ecause disinflationary forces are going to change things a little bit, there’s nothing in that that is in principle against the model, and we’re the central bank in the middle of that model.  166 of 247MR. LACKER. Yes. 

[SECTION]

MR. EVANS. Okay. Then I didn’t understand your comment about when we talk about output gaps. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Yellen. MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want first to thank the authors and presenters for raising a host of important issues about inflation dynamics.  Uncertainty about the longer-run inflation outlook is quite high right now, and the extent of disagreement among forecasters is quite large.  Even so, as I read the papers I was asking myself if there were some morals here for current policy.  I identified thr ee that emerged from the staff contributions and the broader literature, and I just  wanted to take a minute to hi ghlight what I thought the policy conclusions are. First, the papers and broader literature suggest a very str ong theoretical rationale, and I see significant empirical evidence, for the view that the level of economic activity matters to inflation. The general principle that very lo w levels of economic activity—whether they’re measured by marginal costs as they are in the New Keynesian model, or by output gaps, capacity utilization, or unemployment—cause inflation to fall is a common thread across a broad set of macro models used for monetary policy analysis.  As Jeff Fuhrer  noted, without some connection between real activity and infla tion, these models just have no linkage between monetary policy and inflation. As Jeff noted, models with slack fit the inflation data reasonably well, and over the past year Phillips curve type models do a pretty good job of explaining the decline we’ve seen in core inflation. This is a point that I made and President Evans made as well a couple of meetings ago.  Going forward, with marginal co sts obviously very depressed and considerable    167 of 247slack in evidence by any measure, these mode ls predict continuing downward pressure on inflation. A second clear policy takeaway from the literature and presentations is that, without question, inflation expectations ar e an important determinant of inflation.  And, as with slack, there is considerable uncertainty about how to measure t hose expectations and about what forecast horizon is relevant.  But in the current situation, a wide range of inflation expectations has been holding fairly steady, and I think the presentations suggest  that well-anchored inflation expectations should help to count er the disinflationary pressures arising from very low levels of economic activity over the next couple of years.  This is something that makes me less worried that I otherwise would be about outright deflationary outcomes. The third policy conclusion to my mind is the one I want to emphasize the most.  There is obviously a great deal of uncertainty about the exact nature of the inflation process, and I conclude that that’s something we have to take account of as we formulate monetary policy.  There’s a large literature on optimal monetary policy under uncert ainty, and it lays out several key principles. The first is that there are relatively simple policies, and Taylor-type  rules are a class of them, an excellent example.  These policies are r obust in the sense that they work well across a range of different models and degrees of difficulty  in measuring gaps, and there is a very large literature documenting this.  As we know, the policy choices of this Committee have come reasonably close to the predictions of some variant of the Taylor rule for th e last several decades, and, as the Bluebook indicates, most variants of Ta ylor-type rules currentl y indicate, as I said before, that the funds rate should stay near zero for a long time.  168 of 247A second principle of optimal policy under uncertainty is that policy should be formulated to guard against particularly undesi rable outcomes, and this principle to my mind suggests we should stay at th e zero bound for an extended period because we can easily raise rates, but it’s hard to lower them. A third principle is that po licy responses to different ec onomic indicators should depend on the quality of the signals they are sending abou t the state of the economy.  And in the current situation, the level of  unemployment and the degree of slack in the labor market that we see is so enormously large by every measure that it is sending a strong signal now , and that’s something that we should be responding to. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Governor Kohn. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had a question rather than a comment, and it’s for Mike. I had trouble understa nding the paragraph or two that  you had in your paper about the current situation. I guess you say we shouldn’t be sitting around this table talking about gaps.  So what should we have been talking about this  morning?  And within this model, how do you explain what has happened over the last two year s?  We’ve had an enormous drop in output and a significant decline in inflation. So how woul d you have designed this morning’s discussion if you had had an opportunity? 

[SECTION]

MR. DOTSEY. I don’t know if I can tell you exactly what’s going on in the economy today. That’s a little bit of a ha rd road to walk down.  But with regard to your first point, if I were sitting at this table, I would find the discussion among Char lie and Narayana and Jeff very productive. Charlie could have had his entire discussion without mentioning the word “gap” once. Basically he was talking about what kind of shocks he thinks are hitting the economy, given an underlying model based on, I guess, some of his own work and things like that.  What 169 of 247kind of impact would those shocks have on the economy, and then what should monetary policy’s actual response be?  Th at I find extremely valuable in my own thinking, and that’s the way I think about policy. The gap construct is something that, as Charlie commented, is going to be model- specific. But I find that when people rely on that too much wi thout doing the hard work, which people have done around here in th is discussion, of talking about wh at are the beneficial models that help us understand things and the disagreements we might have over them in terms of identifying what’s going on, then that can some times lead away from a productive discussion.  So I don’t know what you talked about this morning, but if you— 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. So within the confines of th e model, what happened over the last two years?  How did we get where we are, and wh at are the implications of that for policy? 

[SECTION]

MR. DOTSEY. It’s unfortunate for the New Keynesian models that at  this point it seems that what we had was a large financial meltdown.  What we do not have yet, but which is part of the big research agenda that’s just taking off, is a way to integrate the way we think about financial markets and their role in the economy.  So  if I were trying to do things now, I might say I’m going to go look at Bernanke and Gertler and Gilchrist or I’m going to look at Kiyotake and Moore or maybe models like Diamond and Rajan and I might even pull away from the New Keynesian paradigm and try to understand what they’re telling us is going on in the economy, and then try to figure out a response. So I think there’s no getting around it, as Jeff Lacker says—we’ve got to put our models on the table, see where they fit things, and then figure stuff out imperfectly.  And in that discussion, if you want to use gaps and you find them helpful, that’s fine, and they may be a good communication device as  well.  But I don’t think they’re essential.  They’re an artificially construc ted device that you can just sort of think about or not.   170 of 247CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. A two-hande r from President Kocherlakota. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. But the model is tryi ng to account for all variability in the data, so it’s going to say something about the an swer to Governor Kohn’s question about what has happened. What is the model going to say?   Some shock has taken place according to the model. What is the shock that has happened in the last two years,  or what is the constellation of two or three shocks that have happened in the last two years? 

[SECTION]

MR. DOTSEY. I would be no more informative on that than anybody here.  But one could say that one of the things that has happened in financial mark ets is that capital is not being allocated efficiently across the economy; that is, the firms that might be getting the capital in normal times, maybe smaller productive firms, are not getting it, and some larger, non­productive firms, perhaps because they have be tter balance sheets or have been around, are getting it, and that woul d look like a technology shock. But, then again, maybe we’re in a world wher e we have ambiguity aversion in our model, and all of a sudden people have become very, ve ry uncertain about things or demanding large risk premiums, and, as a result, investment isn’ t being done because it’s being priced in a crazy way. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. But in the Philadelphia model that you use? MR. DOTSEY. In the Philadelphia model where this is being soaked up as an inefficient investment shock that tells you that potential is going down a lot as well as output. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Right. MR. DOTSEY. I’m a little bit uncomfortable w ith that as the explanation, but that’s what that particular New Keynesi an model would say.  I’m trying to remember, I think the model    171 of 247at Chicago also has a big role for some of th ese investment-type technology shocks as well and whether they are—  

[SECTION]

MR. EVANS. I would guess it does. 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. How would it explain the decline in inflation, then? If potential has gone down along with output, why has inflation gone fro m whatever it is, 2½ pe rcent to 1½ percent? 

[SECTION]

MR. DOTSEY. Given that unemployment has gone up to 10 percent, and in Jeff’s graphs you thought that we had th is 8 percent drop in marginal cost, or some giant gap, the question would be: Why hasn’t inflation gone from 2.2 percent to minus 2.2 percent, not from  2.2 percent to 1½ percent? 

[SECTION]

MR. LACKER. Well, the answer is always goi ng to be our policy role, right?  Isn’t it? 

[SECTION]

MR. KOHN. We’ve changed targets? MR. LACKER. The answer to why inflation did what it did would be a com bination of the model and our policy role. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Mike was kind en ough to mention Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist earlier. [Laughter] I would point out that Mark and other coau thors have updated that paper to include exactly those kinds of shocks, a nd they get disinflation and all of those things.  And what’s happening is that as there is a s hock to the capital of th e banking system that prevents credit from going through to purchasers,  or small businesses, or consumers, or whatever, the drop in their demand is just a decline in the aggregate demand curve, and you get all the results you would expect from that. A two-hander from President Evans. MR. EVANS. Well, let me just say that I ag ree with many things that Mike just said, and, in fact, in the specificati on that Justiniano and Primiceri  write down, the output gap is not a 172 of 247fundamental.  It’s a constructed variable, and it’s really the marginal cost pricing, as Jeff mentioned, that is going to be fundamental for how firms are setting prices.  So that’s absolutely right. It’s also in the language  that we as economic researchers are comfortable with, and we can lay it out and understand it quite well.  Part of  what we’re getting into  is how we communicate with other people and with the public, and res ource slack tends to be a pretty good proxy in a number of cases, so I think that’s why we keep coming back to it.  These memos are right to point out the cases where we are going to be misled by that, and then the question is:  How do we defend against that?  I think our track record is pretty good.  We always n eed to be reminded of this, and getting the models  better would be great. 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Bullard. MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I really enjoyed this discussion and the papers. I thought they were rea lly good.  I’m going to review thr ee things I said earlier on this issue and see if any of my views have changed, given those priors that I laid down before the discussion. One of the things I said earlier in a memo  was that theoretical conceptions are hotly contested—that’s just the state of  play in the macro world.  I’m actually happy to see a debate between the Philadelphia conception, the DSGE m odel, and the Chicago conception—it lays out explicitly “Here’s what the assump tions are,” and I’m sorry it’s co mplicated, but there are lots of issues there.  And that’s where we are. But there’s also the question of moving between models where you can pin down what the output gap is —a clear theoretical conception versus the traditional concept of an output gap.  There you don’t know what the mapping is back to the people you’re trying to help with your policy, an d I think that’s harder to swallow.  And   173 of 247estimates, given any concept, are subject to difficult measurement issues, and we understand that. The second thing I said was, “Okay, forget  about theory, you don’t care about theory, blah, blah, blah. You just want to find an object that will help you pr edict inflation, and you’re happy to use whatever this object is.”  I think that, controlling for expectations, a gap is only a interpretation of the empirical relationships that you see is precisely that monetary policy did not react sufficiently strongly to offset whatever shock hit the economy to  keep you close to the inflation target. One of the themes I’ve come back to over and again is that if  we’re doing inflation targeting or some kind of quasi-inflation targ eting—if that’s what we’re doing— if you run it really well and your tools are pretty effective, you should be able pretty much to offset all of the shocks and keep inflation really  close to target.  You go back to run your regressions later and see what the relationships are. It’s only going to  look like inflation is rela ted to the target or a constant. So I think that is an issue for the empirical work—for those who want to throw away the theory and just find variables that are going to help you predict inflation.  I think, frankly, that inflation targeting, or quasi-inflation targeting, has worked pr etty well over the last 15 years or so in the United States. The third point I made—a point on which the papers were particularly uninformative—is how gaps are related to bubbles, and that, I think, is uncharted territory.  A lot of our rhetoric says this is a housing bubble, the housing bubble somehow collapsed, and that’s what’s going on in this economy. I don’t see models that have those kinds of bubbles in them.  To me, a bubble has to mean something about an equilibrium that is not the fundamental equilibrium—there’s     174 of 247this fundamental equilibrium in the economy, but somehow actual prices a nd actual expectations are up somewhere far away from that fundament al.  And then, that collapses on you, and you come back to the fundamental.  What does that m ean?  Does that mean that you’re back at your trend and you shouldn’t try to rein flate the bubble, or what?  I thi nk the Chairman has said that bubbles are one of the really tough issues of the decade for monetary policy, and I agree completely with that. The thing I was worried about for policy is that we might be overemphasizing output gaps in our policy discussions when  we say blanket-type things like, “Well, it  looks like gaps are big”, or “It looks like resource util ization is really low compared with some conception of where we think it should be, and, therefor e, there can’t be any inflation in  the near term or the medium term.”  I think that might be an  over-interpretation of what both the theoretical and the empirical literature tell us. I had comments on all of the papers—I’m going to  shorten this up.  I just want to talk about the global slack hypothesis a little bit.  We’ve been ta lking in the profession about globalization for years and years and years. I have to say that the conventional wisdom, the hallway discussion that you get on this, is that you  can treat the U.S. like a closed economy and it is okay. I actually think that that  has not been that bad an appr oach over the past 25 years, but we may be at an inflection point where that is  not the right thing to do going forward. If you’re going to look at empirical evidence that’s collect ed over the past 25 year s, you’re going to get weak relationships with respect to the global ou tput gaps or the global economy.  That may not be the right way to think of things going forward. I have also been concerned with the question of optimal policy in open economy settings, which I think has generally been deemphasized ar ound the table here, for the reason I just gave,    175 of 247for years, but that may not be the thing to do going forward.  In the fledgling literature on optimal policy and open economy models, you have  always got a situation where you’ve got some domestic prices, you’ve got import prices, and then you’re going to construct a price index that includes both. Should you be reacting to those import prices?  That’s the question.  The models tell you “no.” The models say you should have some conception of domestic prices or whatever the sticky prices ar e in your economy and you should re act to those.  The foreign central bank is already reacting to those prices in the foreign economy.  So when you react to the import prices, you are sort of doubly reacting, beca use foreign monetary policy is already trying to control those prices. So the fact that you’re  reacting back and forth then can create problems in the global equilibrium—a bubble, if you like.  I worry about that, and I don’t think that that has been thought about carefully enough, and I th ink it will become more and more important as we go forward, especially with the rise of Asia. Let me talk about the Fuhrer et al. paper for just a second.  He has got backward-looking expectations, a theme to which I am very sympat hetic.  You’re thinking about trying to measure this perfectly forward-looking component durin g the Great Moderation, or during the past 15 years, a period where it may not be that important, because, in some sense, nothing happened during that period. But the questi on would be:  If you get to special times, is that really the way to think about expectations, as purely extrapola ting from the past?  There’s a famous paper in macroeconomics—some of you will know it—called “T he Ends of Four Big Inflations” by Tom Sargent. He describes hyperinf lations after World War I, when prices were going up like crazy.  The government makes a credib le commitment on a day, and the hyperinflation ends at noon on that day—it’s just amazing.  So there’s an example.   It is a hugely stre ssed situation, but rational expectations come in with a vengeance.  Are we  in a highly stressed situation?  Maybe. We  176 of 247avoided Depression 2.0. You might in terpret that as a very special situation relativ e to the past 25 years. That’s what has got me a little worried about a backward-looking approach to expectations. I think the threats of sharp movements in this kind of environment are very real.  We have to be careful about them.  Will they occur?  Maybe not.  But we need to be very careful in this situation. So that’s just a comment on the Fuhrer approach.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Tha nk you.  President Plosser. 

[SECTION]

MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll tr y to keep my commen ts brief.  I want to talk a little about what I took away from some  of this.  I found the pape rs very interesting and fun to read and think about. One of the less ons I take away from this —and it’s one that I’ve taken away for some time, and Jeff referred to it —is that a little humility may be in order, in terms of our ability to truly unde rstand particularly s hort-run dynamics in th e inflation process. One of the things that I think we learned from this discussion is that, depending on the model that you write down, and de pending on the nature of the shoc ks that you allow to hit that model, you can get different outcomes, you can ge t different relationships between variables within that model. That means that we need to be a little cau tious in our interpretation about how we rely in our policy discussions on one set of  variables versus anothe r set of variables in guiding our outlooks for inflation. One of the things that I have tried to convey in  some of my comments over the last several months is that I ha ve been worried that in the way we talk about inflation—particularly the future of inflation and deflation—we ha ve become a little too fixated on measures of output gaps.  One of the things we  learned from this is that, depending on which output gap you write down and what you think of the shocks, other things may matter, so we need to be a little more careful about “diversi fying our portfolio” about what’s going to happen and protect ourselves from being put in a bad spot. 177 of 247So, I think humility is important.  I think the na ture of the shocks is important.  I think the conversation between Governor Kohn and Mike Do tsey about what we think this shock is and what it did is a useful kind of conversation to  have.  The problem comes when the output gap becomes a shorthand for a whole bunch of other stuff, and then it becomes a communication problem, because it may or may not be the right shorthand.  There may be circumstances where you need a different shorthand or a different measure.  And that’s where talking about the nature of the shocks becomes useful in how we think about it. If you focus on traditional measures of the output gap, it seems to me there are circumstances where, with excessive emphasis on trying to close that gap—I’m not talking about the current circumstances, necessarily—you may not  be conducting policy in an optimal way or even increasing welfare. You may actually re duce welfare if you focus on the wrong metric or the wrong target with the gaps. So there may not be an easy, one-to-one correspondence at times between policy that’s welfare improving and policy th at closes gaps, and we  need to be cautious about that. Charlie Evans commented earlier about taking other variables into account, and it is very important that we do that. The last comment I’ll make is that I want to  reinforce Janet Yellen’s point, because she and I agree on this—some people may find that unusual.  Given the uncert ainty that we have about the class of models that we deal with, ther e’s a lot of work on robust rules.  Some of the staff in San Francisco—John Williams and others—ha ve worked hard on this.  I find this work very useful, because they take models where we actually can compute optimal policy, and then ask what happens: What kind of simple rules coul d we use that would get us close to something that looks like the optimal policy?  There’s been a great deal of work on this.  The simple rules they write down typically are of a Taylor rule  variety with an output gap and a deviation of 178 of 247inflation from some target.  One thing that co mes out of those robust rules, though, is that the answer is not that the output gap doesn’t matter.  But in most of those exercises that I’m familiar with, the weight on the output gap in  the Taylor rule tends to be pr etty small.  I think that’s one of the things that is interesting about some of those rules.  The important thing about those robust rules is that the weight on the deviation from inflation target gets very big, and the weight on the output gap is relatively small in many cases. One of the helpful things that we could do is  think about the class of robust rules and about how robust these rules are ag ainst the class of models that are on the table.  That could help focus our discussion and give us, again, this  robustness in our policy thinking that could be very helpful.  So I’m very positive towards that li ne of research in the literature, because, as we can see here today, models are different, and they can give different outcome s.  We need to be cautious about what we know and how precise we  are and not put too much weight on any one factor at any one point in time—“diversify our po rtfolio,” if you will.  Again, my argument for lo these many months is to try to get our language  to look more robust and a little less focused on single metrics. I want to thank all of the Reserve Bank staff.  They did a great job, and I think this has been a very useful discu ssion.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. ROSENGREN. I also want to thank each  of the presenters for giving very good presentations. Over breakfast, as Jeff alluded to, President Plosser and I had, I thought, a very useful discussion about models a nd what was generating our result s.  I asked him, given where the output gap was, and given where at least some  measures of marginal cost might be, how he 179 of 247was getting inflation actually risi ng.  And his answer was, “Well, the driver is really inflation expectations.” I have one question for each of you. It will be quick.  Let me posit my questions to each of you first, and then I will let you all speak.  My first question is for Mike.  You’ve highlighted the difficulty with coming up with the output gap, and I think it’s well unde rstood that there are a lot of ways to calculate the out put gap, and there are estimation i ssues with the output gap.  But when I look at forecasts of infl ation—if I look at the Blue Chip, if I look at professional forecasters, if I look at the dispersion in su rveys—I find that the modeling of inflation expectations by economists isn’t much better than the modeling of output gaps.  Gary Stern gave us the advice that you need a model to beat a model as he was leaving.  So we’re not very good at modeling expectations; it seems like we have much the same problem when modeling the output gap. I’d like you to sp eak to the alternative, whic h is, how do we do a good job of modeling expectations, or what more work needs to be done? For Mark, my question is that, based on my  understanding of at least some of the international literature, importers  tend to price to the U.S. market.  If you could just put your work in the context of that observation, I think that would be useful for me. And for Jeff, in light of Mike’s comments, a nd his paper, I would be  interested in your views of the implications of the way you model infl ation, given the alternativ e that Mike has laid out in his paper. 

[SECTION]

MR. DOTSEY. That’s a really excellent que stion, which I’m going to answer in three parts. In the models that we’re all looking at, expectations  are rational.  To the extent that that’s not a good approximation for how people actually form  expectations, then that’s problematic for the models as well.  People like Jim Bullard have worked on models of learning and other types  180 of 247of things, and a lot of those models probably can be  incorporated to try to flesh out expectational issues, if we become uncomfortable with the assumption of rational expectations at high frequencies. Expectations are a dicey thing for the Comm ittee to base policy on, because often they can be somewhat sticky, as you allude to.  If the Committee were to lose some of its credibility, often those expectations could look good, but you could have lost the game, and expectations are going to get out of hand. I think the late 1970s and then the disinflation of the 1980s was an example of that.  The inflation sort of led the expectations—we had this big run-up in inflation, and expectations followed it. On the way dow n, I think expectations of inflation actually followed the Fed’s moves as it was gaining cred ibility and probably made the disinflationary costs in actuality a lot worse.  So I think you are right to poin t out those types of things, but, again, all I can do is say we’ve got these models on the table, and that’s the best we can do.  And you’re right to question perhaps some of th e assumptions underlyi ng what is going on. 

[SECTION]

MR. WYNNE.  On the question of the pricing to the U.S. market, we actually do consider this case. One of the contributions in our background paper is to push some of the existing literature forward by explicitly inco rporating the so-called local currency pricing assumptions as opposed to the pr oducer currency pricing assumption. If you go back to exhibit 6 in our handout, that’s what gives rise to these complicated additional terms in the Phillips curve expression to capture these deviations from the law of one price. If you don’t have people pr icing in dollars for the U.S. ma rket, you’re just going to have to worry about the domestic and foreign output gaps, or domestic and foreign real marginal costs. This is what makes it very tricky to test  this idea that foreign influences matter, because you can also just write down a Phillips curve wher e all the foreign influences come in through a     181 of 247terms-of-trade-like term.  But it’s a gap—it’s a deviation of the terms of trade from its frictionless level. A lot of very subtle econometric issues co me up then in trying to figure out why the terms-of-trade variable is in the Phillips curve expre ssion.  Is it to capture  deviations from the law of one price, or is it some sort of a summar y statistic for all foreign slack?  I think it makes a big difference to the validity of the hypothesis. This was what motivated our final remark about why we really need to rethink some of the ear lier econometric work, some of the good work that was done here at the Board of Governors, the work  that the researchers at  the BIS have done, and some of the earlier work we did on this questi on.  However, these terms-of-trade variables look like some of the variables people have traditiona lly included in Phillips curve regressions.  We know that oftentimes you’re going to  need to put in energy prices or import prices or food prices in your traditional Phillips curve to get the fit to work.  And th e theoretical framework we have laid out explains why these things may, in fact, matter.  But a lot more work needs to be done before we could actually apply this to some of the policy issues Jeff and Mike have addressed in their presentations. 

[SECTION]

MR. FUHRER. Thanks for your question, Er ic.  I would take on board some of Michael’s and coauthors’ caveats about the use of statistical gaps.  I think my approach would be somewhat similar to what the Chairman wa s saying in response to another question—we wouldn’t take a univariate approach in gauging the state of the economy.  We’d look to see what’s going on with unemployment, and I’d say it’s clearly elevated, an d I don’t see evidence in traditional measures of reallocati on to suggest that anything extr aordinary is going on there.  Therefore, I would take on board that a good por tion, maybe the majority, of the increase in unemployment is really reflective of slack resources.  When I c ouple that with the observations   182 of 247on marginal cost, which are severely depressed, I think I have several measures that all are telling me roughly the same story.  So in that rega rd, at least from the point  of view that the gap or utilization is a dr iving variable, I would expect so me downward pressure on inflation. Now, as we suggested in the discussion around the table, inflati on expectations might counterbalance that, but I would em phasize in that regard, at two le vels, that what I said in my presentation is that the implication of the models is that the inflation expectation really implies a concern for future marginal cost and gaps, not just  inflation expectations per se.  That’s at the pointy-headed rational exp ectations level.  But let’s take a step back and think, along the lines that President Narayana Kocherlakota was sayi ng, about the importance of the microdata—   

[SECTION]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Narayana Rao Kocherlakota.  [Laughter] 

[SECTION]

MR. FUHRER. I’ll get the middle name next  time.  [Laughter] The goal keeps increasing. At the micro level, let’s think about the story that motivates these kinds of models that we use, which at its base is not unr easonable, and that is that there are firms who are trying to set prices. What do they consider in trying to set pr ices?  They think about their cost structure.  That’s where the marginal cost comes from.  I w ould say that today the cost structure really is challenged. Wages are pressured to be quite low, and productivity a ppears to be fairly high.  So from the cost side, that puts dow nward pressure.  The other thing th at they take into account is how much they can mark up over those costs.  That’s a factor of market power and current demand circumstances.  And I would say, there ag ain, the ability to mark up over their cost structure is not terrific. So you don’t need the pointy-headed rational expectations model to tell you that the key determinants that fold into these models would suggest that, in current 183 of 247circumstances, the pressures on inflation, taking in to account expectations and costs and gaps or whatever else, appear to be on the downside.  That’s the way I would answer that question. Now, I did say, as President Plosser emphasized, that we need to have some humility when we approach this. And I th ink that to date we are starting to see perhaps the beginning of a puzzle that says, as Mike Dotsey suggested, that  inflation maybe should have fallen more than these models have suggested.  And I think we’ll be  looking at that carefully, because if it doesn’t fall noticeably over the next year, we have some  ‘splaining to do.  [Laughter] And that will require some additional thought.  So thank you for the question, and that’s what I would say.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The Ricky Ricardo theory of economics.  [Laughter] President Hoenig.  

[SECTION]

MR. HOENIG. Thank you. Just a short observati on.  This is, as others have said, very interesting in terms of inflation dynamics and out put gaps.  And I agree that we need to use models and work them and then a pply our judgment to the situation. But I also want to remind the Committee that we  do need to begin to think differently in some ways.  I can’t help but recall that in 2003 Borio and White gave a paper at the Jackson Hole Symposium on issues around not so much bubbles but very strong expansion and the conditions we create that cause these cycles, if  you will.  It means that you can look at where interest rates are relative to at least an estimated  long-term equilibrium rate and at how fast credit growth is moving in a particular period of time.  If you reread that paper now, you will think they were on to something.  While we need these output gaps, and so forth, the financial system is driving a lot of what’s happening, and we need to  bring that into the equation more directly.  involved with.   184 of 247There’s more to it than the output gap, and I’m a little worried, because of that, about making inflation targeting your goal, because you can have a very stable inflation environment for a while and have a very volatil e financial environment with the ex cesses that go on there.  So I recommend that you all rer ead that paper.  Thank you.
