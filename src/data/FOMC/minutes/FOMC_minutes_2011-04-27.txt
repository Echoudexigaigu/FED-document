Developments in Financial Markets and the Fe d-
eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet  
The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets during the period since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on 
March 15, 2011.  He also reported on System open 
market operations, including the continuing reinves t-
ment into longer -term Treasury securities of principal 
payments recei ved on the SOMA’s holdings of agency 
debt and agency -guaranteed mortgage- backed securities 
(MBS) as well as the ongoing purchases of additional Treasury securities first authorized in November 2010.  Since November, purchases by the Open Market Desk 
of the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York had i n-
creased the SOMA’s holdings by $422 billion.   The 
Manager reported on the U.S. authorities’ participation 
in the coordinated foreign exchange intervention an-nounced by the Group of Seven  (G-7) finance minis-
ters and c entral bank governors on March 1 7, 2011 .  By 
unanimous votes, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic and foreign exchange market transactions 
over the intermeeting period.  
By unanimous vote, the Committee agreed to e xtend 
the reciprocal currency (swap)  arrangements with the 
Bank of Canada and the Banco de M éxico for an add i-
tional year beginning in mid -December 2011; these 
arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve’s 
participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994.  The arrangem ent with the Bank of 
Canada is in the amount of $2 billion equivalent, and the arrangement with the Banco de M éxico is in the 
amount of $3 billion equivalent.  The vote to renew the 
System’s participation in these swap arrangements was 
taken at this meetin g because of a provision in the a r-
rangements that requires each party to provide six months’ prior notice of an intention to terminate its participation.  
The staff next gave a presentation on strategies for normalizing the stance and conduct of monetary policy over time as the economy strengthens.  Normalizing 
the stance  of policy would entail the withdrawal of the 
current extraordinary degree of accommodation at the 
appropriate time,  while normalizing the conduct  of policy  
would involve draining  the large volume of reserve ba l-
ances in the banking system and shrinking the overall size of the balance sheet, as well as returning the SOMA to its historical composition of essentially only  
Treasury securities.  The presentation noted a few key 
issues that the Committee would need to address in 
deciding on its approach to normalization.  The first key issue was  the extent to which the Committee would 
want to tighten policy, at the appropriate time,  by in-
creasing short -term interest rates , by decreasing its 
holdings  of longer -term securities , or both .  Because 
the two policies would restrain economic activity by tightening financial conditions, the y could be combined 
in various ways  to achieve similar outcomes .  For e x-
ample, in principle , the Committee could accompli sh 
essentially the same degree o f monetary tightening by 
selling assets sooner and faster but rais ing the target for 
the federal funds rate later and more slowly, or by sel l-
ing assets later and more slowly but increas ing the fed-
eral funds rate target soone r and faster.  The SOMA 
portfolio could be reduced by selling securities outright , 
by ceasing the reinvestment of principal payments on its securities holdings , or both.  A second key issue was  
the extent to which the Committee might choose to 
vary the pace of any asset sales it undertakes in r e-
sponse to economic and financial conditions.  If it chose to make the pace of sales quite responsive to 
conditions, the FOMC would be able to actively use 
two policy instruments —asset sales and the federal 
funds rate target —to pursue  its economic objectives, 
which could increase the scope and flexibility for a d-
justing financial conditions.  In contrast, sales at a pace that varied less with changes in economic and financial conditions and was preannounced and largely prede-
termined would leave the federal funds rate target as the Committee’s primary  active policy instrument,

which could result in policy that is more straightfor-
ward  for the Committee to calibrate and to communi-
cate.  Finally, the staff presentation noted  that the 
Committee would  need to decide if and when to use 
the tools that it has developed to temporarily reduce  
reserve balances —reverse repurchase agreements and 
term deposits —in order to tighten the correspondence 
between any changes in the interest rate the Federal Reserve pays on excess reserves and the changes in the federal funds rate.  
Meeting participants agreed on several principles that would guide the Committee’s strategy for norm alizing 
monetary policy.  First, with regard to the normaliza-tion of the stance of monetary policy, the pace and s e-
quencing of the policy steps would be driven by the Committee’s monetary policy objectives for maximum employment and price stability.  P articipants noted that 
the Committee’s decision to discuss the appropr iate 
strategy for normalizing  the stance of  policy at the cu r-
rent meeting did not mean that the move toward such 
normalization would necessarily begin soon.  Second,  
to normalize the conduct of monetary policy, it was 
agreed that the size of the SOMA’s sec urities portfolio 
would be reduced over the  intermediate term to a level 
consistent with the implementation of monetary policy through the management of the federal funds rate r a-
ther than through variation in the size or composition 
of the Federal Reserve’ s balance sheet .  Third, over the 
intermediate term, the exit strategy would involve re-
turning  the SOMA to holding essentially only  Treasury 
securities in order to minimize the extent to which the Federal Reserve portfolio might affect the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.  Such a shift was 
seen as requiring sales of agency securities at some point.  And fourth, asset sales would be implemented within a framework that had been communicated to the 
public in advance, and at a pace that potentially could 
be adjusted in response to changes in economic or fi-nancial conditions.   
In addition, nearly all participants indicated that the first step toward normalization should be ceasing to reinvest payments of principal on agency securities and , 
simultaneously or soon after , ceasing to reinvest pri n-
cipal payments on Treasury securities.  Most partic i-
pants viewed h alting reinvestments as a way to begin to 
gradually reduce  the size of the balance sheet .  It was 
noted, however, that ending reinvestments  would co n-
stitute a modest step toward policy tightening, implying that that decision should be made in the context of the economic outlook and the Committee’s policy obje c-
tives.  In addition, changes in the statement language regarding forward policy guid ance would need to ac-
company the normalization process.  
Participants expressed  a range of views on some a s-
pects  of a normalization strategy.  Most participants 
indicated that once asset sales became appropriate, such sales should be put on a largely predet ermined 
and preannounced path; however, many of those pa r-
ticipants noted that the pace of sales could nonetheless 
be adjusted in response to material changes in the ec o-
nomic outlook.  Several other participants preferred instead that the pace of sales be a key policy tool and 
be varied actively in response to changes in the ou t-
look.  A majority of participants preferred that sales of agency securities come after the first increase in the FOMC’s target for short -term interest rates, and many 
of those participants also expressed a preference that the sales proceed relatively gradually, returning the SOMA’s composition to all Treasury securities over 
perhaps  five years.  Participants noted that, for any gi v-
en degree of policy tightening, more -gradual sales that  
commenced later in the normalization process would allow for an earlier increase of the federal funds rate target from its effective lower bound  than would be the 
case if asset sales commenced earlier and at a more rap-
id pace.  As a result , the Committee would later have 
the option of easing policy with an interest rate cut if economic conditions then warranted .  An earlier in-
crease in the federal funds rate was also mentioned as 
helpful to limit  the potential for  the very low level of 
that rate to encourage financial imbalances.  A few pa r-
ticipants expressed a preference that sales begin before any increase in the federal funds rate target, and a few other participants  indicated that sales and increases in 
the federal funds rate target should commence at t he 
same time.  The participants who favored earlier sales 
also generally i ndicated a preference for relatively rapid  
sales, with some suggesting that agency securities in the SOMA be reduced to zero over as little as one or two 
years.  Such an approach was  viewed as  allowing  for a 
faster  return to a normal policy environment, potentia l-
ly reduc ing any upside risks to inflation stemming from 
outsized reserve balances, and more quickly eliminat ing 
any ef fects of SOMA holdings of agency securities on 
the allocation of credit.   
Most participants saw changes in the target for the fe d-
eral funds rate as the preferred active  tool for tighte n-
ing monetary policy when appropriate .  A number of 
participants noted that it would be advisable to begin using the temporary r eserve s-draining tools in advance 
of an increase in the Committee’s federal funds rate target, in part because doing so would put the Federal

Reserve in a better position to assess the effectiveness 
of the draining tools and judge the size of draining op-erations that might be required to support changes in 
the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate in impl e-
menting a desired increase in short -term rates.  A nu m-
ber of participants also noted that they would be pr e-
pared to sell securities sooner if the tempor ary reserves - 
draining operations and the end of the reinvestment of principal payments were not sufficient to support a fairly tight link between increases in the IOER rate and increases in short -term market interest rates.  
In the discussion of normalization, some partic ipants 
also noted their preferences about the longer -run 
framework for monetary policy implementation.  Most of these  participants indicated that they preferred that 
monetary policy eventually operate through a corridor -
type system in which  the federal funds rate trades in the 
middle of a range , with the IOER rate  as the floor and 
the discount rate as the  ceiling of the range , as opposed 
to a floor -type system in which a relatively high level of 
reserve balances keeps the federal funds rate near the 
IOER rate.  A couple of participants noted that any normalization strategy would likely involve an elevated balance sheet with the federal funds rate target near the IOER rate—as in floor -type systems —for some time, 
and therefore the Committee would accumulate exp e-
rience during the process of normalizing policy that would allow it to make a more informed choice regar d-
ing the longer -term framework at a later date.  
The Committee agreed that more discussion of these issues was needed, and no decision s regarding the 
Committee’s strategy for normalizing policy were made at this meeting.  
Staff Review of the Economic Situation  
The information reviewed at the April  26–27 mee ting 
indicated, on balance, that economic activity ex panded 
at a moderate pace in recent months, and labor market 
conditions continued to improve gradually.  Headline consumer price inflation was boosted by large increases in food and energy prices, but measures of underlying inflation were still subdued and longer -run inflation 
expecta tions remained stable.  
Private nonfarm payroll employment increased again in March, and the gains in hiring for the first quarter as a 
whole were somewhat above the pace seen in the 
fourth quarter.  A number of indicators of job ope n-
ings and hiring plans improved in February and March.  Although initial claims for unemployment i nsurance 
were flat , on net, from early March through the middle 
of April, they remained lower than earlier in the year.  The unemployment rate edged down further to 8.8 percent in March, while the labor force particip a-
tion rate was unchanged.  However, both long -duration 
unemployment and the share of workers employed part 
time for economic reasons were still very high.  
Industrial production in the manufacturing sector e x-
panded at a ro bust pace in February and March.  The 
manufacturing capacity utilization rate moved up fu r-
ther, though it continued to be a good bit lower than its 
longer -run average.  Most forward -looking indicators 
of industrial activity, such as the new orders indexes in the national and regional manufacturing surveys, r e-
mained at levels consistent with solid gains in produc-tion in the near term.  However, motor vehicle asse m-
blies were expected  to step down in the second quarter 
from their level in March, reflecting eme rging shortages 
of specialized components imported from Japan.  
The rise in c onsumer spending appeared to have 
slowed to a moderate rate in the first quarter from the stronger pace posted in the fourth quarter of last year.  
Total real personal consumption expenditures picked 
up in February after being about unchanged in January.  
Nominal retail sales, excluding purchases at motor v e-
hicles and parts outlets, posted a sizable gain in March, but sales of new light motor vehicles declined som e-
what.  Real dispos able income edged down in February 
following an increase in January that reflected the te m-
porary reduction in payroll taxes.  In addition, consu m-
er sentiment declined noticeably in March and r e-
mained relatively downbeat in early April.  
Activity in the housing market remained very weak, as the large overhang of foreclosed and distressed prope r-
ties continued to restrain new construction.  Starts and permits of new single -family homes inched down, on 
net, in February and March, and they have been esse n-
tially f lat since around the middle of last year.  Demand 
for housing also continued to be d epressed.  Sales of 
new and existing homes moved lower, on net, in Fe b-
ruary and March, while measures of home prices slid further in February.  
Real business investment in equipment and sof tware 
(E&S) appeared to have increased more robustly in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year.  Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods rose 
in February and March, and businesses’ purchases of 
new vehicles trended higher.  New orders of nond e-
fense capital goods continued to run ahead of shi p-
ments in February and March, and this expanding  
backlog of unfilled orders pointed to further increases 
in shipments in subsequent months.  In addition, su r-
Page 4

vey measures of business conditions and sentiment in 
recent months were consistent with continued robust gains  in E&S spending.  In contrast, business outlays 
for nonresidential construction remained extremely 
weak in February, restrained by high vacancy rates, low 
prices for o ffice and commercial properties, and tight 
credit conditions for commercial real estate lending.  
Real nonfarm inventory investment appeared to have moved up to a moderate pace in the first quarter after slowing sharply in the preceding quarter.  Motor v e-
hicle inventories were drawn down more slowly in the 
first quarter than in the fourth quarter, while data 
through February suggested that the pace of stoc k-
building outside of motor vehicles had picked up a bit.  
Book -value inventory -to-sales ratios in Februa ry were 
in line with their pre -recession norms, and survey data 
in March provided little evidence that businesses per-ceived that their inventories were too high.  
The available data on government spending indi cated 
that real federal purchases fell in the first quarter, led by 
a reduction in defense outlays.  Real expend itures by 
state and local governments also appeared to have d e-
clined, as outlays for construction projects d ecreased 
further in February to a level well below that in the 
fourth quarter, and s tate and local employment conti n-
ued to contract in March.  
The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in February after widening sharply in January.  Following 
a solid increase in January, exports fell back some in 
February, with declines widespread across cat egories.  
Imports also declined in February after pos ting large 
gains in January.  On average, the trade deficit in Jan u-
ary and February was wider than in the fourth quarter.  
Overall U.S. consumer price inflation moved up further  
in February  and March, as increases in the pri ces of 
energy and food commodities continued to be passed through to the retail level.  More recently, su rvey data 
through the middle of April pointed to additional i n-
creases in retail gasoline prices, while increases in the 
prices of food commodities appeared to have mod-erated somewhat.  Excluding food and energy, core consumer price inflation remained relatively subdued.  Although core consumer price inflation over the first three months of the year stepped up somewhat, the  
12-month change in the core consumer price index 
through March was essentially the same as it was a year 
earlier.  Near -term inflation expectations from the 
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Survey s of 
Consumers remained elevated in early April.  But  
longer -term inflation expectations moved down in early April —reversing their uptick in March —and stayed 
within the range that has prevailed over the past several years.  
Available measures of labor compensation sug gested 
that wage increases continued to be restrained by the presence of a large margin of slack in the labor market.  Average hourly earnings for all employees were flat in March, and their average rate of increase over the pr e-
ceding 12  months remained low.  
The pace of recovery abroad appear ed to have    
strengthened earlier this year, but the disaster in Japan raised uncertainties about foreign activity in the near 
term.  In the euro area, production expanded at a solid 
pace, though indicators of consumer  spending       
weakened.  While meas ures of economic activity in 
Germany posted strong gains, economic conditions in Greece and Portugal deteriorated further.  The damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan a p-
peared to be sharply curtailing Japanese economic a c-
tivity and posed concerns about disruptions to supply 
chains and pr oduction in other economies.  Emerging 
market economies (EMEs) continued to expand rapid-
ly.  Rising pric es of oil and other commodities boosted 
inflation in foreign economies.  However, core inflation remained subdued in most of the advanced foreign 
economies, and inflation in the EMEs seemed to have declined as food price inflation slowed.  
Staff Review of the Financial Situation  
The decisions by the FOMC at its March meeting to continue its asset purchase program and to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds 
rate were in line with market expectations ; nonetheless , 
the accompanying statement prompted a modest rise in nominal yields, as market participants reportedly pe r-
ceived a somewhat mo re optimistic tone in the Com-
mittee’s economic outlook , as well as he ightened co n-
cern about inflation risks.  Over the intermeeting pe-riod, yields on nominal Treasury securities changed little,  on net, amid swings in investors’ assessments of 
global  risks.   Short- term funding rates, including the 
effective federal funds rate, shifted down several basis points in early April following a change in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s deposit insurance assessment system.  On net, the expected path of the 
federal funds rate over the next two years was little 
changed over the intermeeting period.  
Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years based on nominal and inflation- protected   
Treasury securities increased slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period, partly reflecting the ongoing rise in

commodity prices.  Staff models suggested that the 
modest increase in i nflation compensation 5  to 10 years 
ahead was mostly attributable to increases in liquidity and inflation -risk premiums rather than higher e x-
pected inflation.  
Over the intermeeting period, yields on corporate bonds were generally little changed , on net, and spreads 
of investment- and speculative -grade corporate bonds 
relative to comparable -maturity Treasury securities na r-
rowed slightly.  Average secondary- market prices for 
syndicated leveraged loans moved up further.  Howev-er, conditions in the municipal bond market remained 
somewhat strained.  
Broad U.S. stock price indexes rose, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, as initial reports  of better -than-
expected first -quarter earnings lifted stock prices in late 
April.  Option- implied volatility on the S&P  500 index 
was moderately lower, on net, ending the inter meeting 
period at the low end of its recent range.   
Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations r e-
mained robust in March.  Net issuance of inves tment - 
and speculative -grade bonds by nonfinancial corpor a-
tions continued to be strong, and outstanding amounts 
of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and nonf i-
nancial commercial paper  increased not iceably.  Gross 
public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was robust in March, and indicators of the credit quality of nonf i-
nancial firms improved further. 
Commercial mortgage markets showed some signs of 
stabilization .  Delinquency rates for commercial real 
estate loans appeared to have leveled off in recent months.  Issuance of commercial mortgage -backed 
securities picked up in the first quarter, although co m-
mercial real estate loans at banks continued to run off.  In commercial real esta te markets, property sales r e-
mained tepid, and prices stayed at depressed levels.  
Rates on conforming fixed -rate residential mor tgages 
rose modestly during the intermeeting period, and their spreads relative to 10 -year Treasury yields narrowed 
slightly.  M ortgage refinancing activity r emained near its 
lowest level in more than two years.  The Treasury D e-
partment’s announcement in late March that it would begin selling its holdings of agency MBS at a gradual pace had little lasting effect on MBS spreads.  Th e Fed-
eral Reserve began competitive sales of the non -agency 
residential MBS held by Mai den Lane II LLC; initial 
sales met with strong demand, but market prices of non-agency residential MBS were reportedly little 
changed overall.  The rates of serious delinquencies for subprime and prime mortgages were nearly unchanged but remained at elevated levels.  However, the rate of new delinquencies on prime mortgages declined fu r-
ther. 
Conditions in consumer credit markets continued to improve gradually.  Total cons umer credit growth 
picked up in February, as a gain in nonrevolving credit more than offset a further contraction in revolving cr e-
dit.  Delinquency and charge -off rates for credit card 
debt moved down in recent months and approached pre-crisis levels.  Iss uance of consumer asset -backed 
securities remained steady in the first quarter of the 
year. 
Bank credit was about unchanged in March after d e-
clining, on average, in January and February.  Core 
loans —the sum of C&I, real estate, and consumer 
loans —continued  to contract, while holdings of secur i-
ties increased moderately.  The Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted in April indicated that, on net, bank lending standards 
and terms had eased somewhat further during the first 
quart er of the year  and demand for C&I loans , com-
mercial mortgages , and auto loans  had increased, while 
demand for residential mortgages continued to decline.  
M2 expanded at a moderate pace in March.  Liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, advanced at a  
solid pace likely reflecting very low opportunity costs of holding such deposits.   Currency advanced signif i-
cantly, supported by robust foreign demand for U.S. bank notes.  
Foreign sovereign bond yields generally were little 
changed and equity prices rose,  on net, over the inte r-
meeting period, although equity prices in Japan r e-
mained below their pre -earthquake levels  despite the 
record amounts of liquidity injected by the Bank of Japan and the expansion of its asset purchase program.  
The European Central B ank raised its main policy rate 
25 basis points to 1¼  percent during the intermeeting 
period, and markets appeared to have priced in add i-
tional rate increases over the rest of the year.  The Bank 
of England and the Bank of Canada left their policy rates un changed, but quotes from futures markets co n-
tinued to suggest that both central banks would raise rates later this year.  China’s monetary authority further 
increased banks’ lending rates and deposit rates and 
continued to tighten reserve requirements; mon etary 
policy in a number of other EMEs was also tightened over the intermeeting period.

The broad nominal index of the U.S. dollar de clined 
more than 2  percent over the intermeeting period, 
though the dollar appreciated, on net, against the Japa-
nese yen.  The yen strengthened to an all -time high 
against the dollar after the earthquake in Japan, but this move was more than reversed when the G -7 countries 
intervened to sell yen.   
In early April, the Portuguese government r equested 
financial support from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, but market pa rticipants 
reportedly remained concerned about whether the Po r-
tuguese government would reach agreement on an a s-
sociated fiscal consolidation plan.  Later in the inte r-
meeting period, yields on Gree ce’s and other per ipheral 
European countries’ sovereign debt jumped, reflecting heightened market focus on a possible r estructuring of 
Greek sovereign debt.  
Staff Economic Outlook  
With the recent data on spending somewhat wea ker, on 
balance, than the staff had expected at the time of the 
March FOMC meeting, the staff revised down its pro-
jection for the rate of increase in real gross d omestic 
product (GDP) over the first half of 2011 .  The effects 
from the disaster in Japan were also anticipated to te m-
porarily hold down real GDP growth in the near term.  Over the medium term, the staff’s outlook for the pace of economic growth was broadly similar to its previous forecast:  As in the March projection, the staff expected 
real GDP to increase at a moderat e rate through 2012, 
with the ongoing recovery in activity receiving conti n-
ued support from accommodative monetary policy, 
increasing credit availability, and fur ther improvements 
in household and business conf idence.  The average 
pace of GDP growth was ex pected to be sufficient to 
gradually reduce the unemployment rate over the pr o-
jection period, though the jobless rate was anticipated 
to remain elevated at the end of 2012.  
Recent increases in consumer food and energy prices, 
together with the small uptick  in core consumer price 
inflation, led the staff to raise its near -term pr ojection 
for consumer price inflation.  However, infla tion was 
expected to recede over the medium term , as food and 
energy prices were anticipated to decelerate.  As in pr e-
vious fore casts, the staff expected core co nsumer price 
inflation to remain subdued over the pr ojection period, 
reflecting stable long er-term inflation expectations and 
persistent slack in labor and product markets. Participants ’ Views on Current Conditions and the 
Economic Outlook  
In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all mee ting 
participants —the five members of the Board of Gov-
ernors and the presidents of the 12 Federal R eserve 
Banks —provided projections of output growth, the 
unemployment rate, and inflation for e ach year from 
2011 through 2013 and over the longer run.  Long er-
run projections represent each partic ipant’ s assess ment 
of the rate to which each variable would be e xpected to 
converge, over time, under a ppropriate mon etary policy 
and in the absence of fu rther shocks.  Pa rticipants ’ 
forecasts are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is attached as an adde ndum to these 
minutes.  
In discussing intermeeting developments and their im-plications for the economic outlook, participants agreed that the information received since their pr e-
vious meeting  was broadly consistent with continuation 
of a moderate economic recovery, despite an unex-
pected slowing in the pace of economic growth in the 
first quarter.  While construction activity remained 
anemi c, measure s of consumer spending and business 
investment continued to expand and labor market con-ditions continued to improve gradually .  Participants 
viewed th e weakness in first -quarter  economic grow th 
as likely to be largely transitory, influenced by un usually 
severe weather , increases in energy and other commod-
ity prices, and  lower -than-expected defense spending .  
As a result, they saw economic growth picking up later 
this year .   
Participants’ forecasts for economic growth for 2012 
and 2013 were largely unchanged  from their January 
projections and continue d to indicate expectations that 
the recovery  will strengthen  somewhat over time .  
Nonetheless, t he pickup in the pace of the economic 
expansion was  expected to be limited , reflecting the 
effects of high energy prices,  modest changes in hous-
ing wealth, subdued  real income gains , and fiscal co n-
traction at the federal, state, and local levels.   Partici-
pants continue d to project the unemployment rate to 
decline gradually over the forecast period but to remain elevated compared with  their assessment s of its longer -
run level.  Participants revised up their projections for 
total inflation in 2011, reflecting recent increases in energy and other commodity prices , but they generally 
anticipated that the recent in crease in inflation would  
be transitory as commodity prices stabilize and inflation expectations remain anchored.   However, they all 
agreed on the importance of closely monitoring devel-
opments regarding inflation and inflation expectations .

Participants ’ judgment that the recovery was co ntinuing 
at a moderate pace reflected both the incoming ec o-
nomic indicators and information re ceived from bus i-
ness contacts.  Growth in consumer spending r emained  
moderate despite the effects of higher gasoline and 
food pr ices, which appeared to have largely offset the 
increase in  disposable  income from the payroll tax cut.   
Participants noted that these higher prices ha d weighed 
on consumer sentimen t about near -term economic 
conditions  but that underlying fundamentals for co n-
tinued moderate growth in spending remained  in place.  
These underlying factors include d continued improv e-
ment in household balance sheets, easing credit cond i-
tions, and strengthening labor markets.  
Activity in the industrial sector also expand ed fu rther.  
Industrial production posted solid gains , and, while the 
most recent readings from some of the regional  manu-
facturing surveys showed small declines , in some cases 
these were from near -record highs.  Manufacturers r e-
main ed upbeat, although a utomakers  were reporting 
some difficulties in obtaining parts normally produced in Japan, which might weigh on motor vehicle produc-
tion in the current quarter.  Investment in equipment and software was  fairly robust .  In contrast, the housing 
sector remain ed distressed , with house prices flat to 
down  and a large overhang of vacant properties r e-
straining new construction , although reports indicated 
that sales volumes and traffic were higher in a few 
areas.  Activity in the commercial real estate sector  con-
tinued to be weak.  
Several participants indicated that, in contrast to the 
somewhat weaker recent economic data, their business 
contacts were more positive  about the economy ’s 
prospects, which supported the participants’ view that 
the recent weakness was likely to prove temporary.   
They acknowledged, however, that sentiment can 
change quickly; indeed, one participant note d that his 
contacts had recent ly turned more pessimistic , and sev-
eral participants indicated that  their business contacts 
expressed concern about the effects of higher co m-
modity prices on their own costs and on the purchasing 
power of households.   
Participants judged that overall conditions in labor 
markets had continued to improve , albeit gradually.  
The unemployment rate ha d decreased further and pa y-
roll employment had risen again in March.  Some pa r-
ticipants reported that more of the ir business contacts 
have plans to increase  their payrolls  later this year .  A 
few participant s noted that firms may be poised to a c-
celerate their pace of hiring because th ey have ex-hausted potential  produ ctivity gains , but others ind i-
cated that  some firms may be putting hiring plans on 
hold until they are more certain of  the future trend in  
materials and other input costs .  Signs of rising wage 
pressures were reportedly limited to  a few skilled  job 
categories for which  workers  are in short supply , while , 
in general , increases in wages have been subdued.  Par-
ticipants discussed whether the significant drop in the unemployment rate might be overstating the degree of improvement in labor markets because many of the 
unemployed have dropped out of the labor force  or 
have accepted jobs that are less desirable than their 
former jobs .   
Financial market conditions continue d to improve  over 
the intermeeting period.  Equity prices ha d risen, on 
balance, since the previous meeting, reflecting an i m-
proved outlook for earnings, and were up more su b-
stantially since the start of the year .  Bankers again r e-
ported improvements in credit quality , with the volume 
of nonperforming  assets declining at larger banks and 
leveling off at smaller banks.  In general, l oan demand 
remain ed weak .  However,  bank lending to medium-
sized  and larger companies increased , and lending to 
small businesses  picked up slightly.  Banks reported an 
easing of lending terms  on C&I loans , usually promp t-
ed by increased competition in the face of still- weak 
loan demand.  Consumer credit conditions also eased somewhat from the tight conditions  seen during the 
recession .  However , demand for consumer credit ot h-
er than auto loans reportedly changed  little.  A few  par-
ticipants expressed concern that the easing of credit 
conditions was creating incentives for increased lev -
erage and risk -taking in some areas , such as leveraged 
syndicated loans and loans to finance land acquisition , 
and that this trend, if it became widespread and exce s-
sive, could  pose a risk to financial stability.   
Participants di
 scussed the  recent rise in inflation, which 
had been  driven  largely by significant increases  in ene r-
gy and , to a somewhat lesser extent , other co mmodity 
prices .  These commodity price increases,  in turn , re-
flected robust global demand and geopolitical devel-
opments  that had reduced  supply .  One participant  
suggested that excess liquidity might be leading to 
speculation in commodity markets, po ssibly putting 
upward pressure on prices .  Many participants reported 
that an increasing  number of business contacts  ex-
pressed concerns about rising cost pressures and were intending , or already attempting , to pass on at least a 
portion of the se higher costs to their customers in o r-
der to protect profit margins.   This development was 
also reflected in the rising  indexes of  price s paid and

received  in several regional manufacturing surveys.  
Some  participants noted that higher commodity  prices  
were negativel y affecting both business and consumer 
sentiment .  Core inflation and other indicators of u n-
derlying inflation over the medium term had increased 
modestly in recent months, but their levels remained 
subdued.   
Participants generally anticipated that the higher level 
of overall inflation would be transitory .  This outlook 
was based partly on a projected  leveling- off of co m-
modity prices  and the belief that longer -run inflation 
expectations would remain stable.  Some partic ipants 
noted that pressures on labor costs continued to be 
muted ; if such circumstances continued, a large, persis-
tent rise in inflation would be unusual.  M easures of 
near-term inflation expectations ha d risen along with 
the recent rise in overall inflation .  While some indic a-
tors of  longer -term expectations  had increased, others 
were little changed  or down , on net, since March .  
Many participants  had become more concerned about 
the upside risks to the inflation outlook , including the 
possibilities that oil prices might continue to rise, that  
there might be greater  pass-through of higher co m-
modity costs into broader price measures , and that ele-
vated overall inflation caused by higher energy and oth-
er commodity prices could lead to a rise in long er-term 
inflation expectations.  Participants  agreed that moni-
toring inflation trends and inflation expectations closely 
was important in determin ing whether action would be 
needed to prevent a more lasting pickup in the rate of general price inflation, which would be costly to r e-
verse .  Maintaining well- anchored inflation expectations 
would depend  on the credibility of the Committee ’s 
commitment to deliver on the price stability part of its 
mandate.  A few  participant s suggested that  clearer 
communication about the Committee ’s inflation ou t-
look, such as explaining  the measures it uses to gauge 
medium -term trend s in general price inflation  and an-
nouncing an explicit numerical  inflation objective , 
would be helpful in this regard .  
While rising ener gy prices posed an upside risk to the 
inflation forecast, th ey also posed a downside risk to 
economic growth.  Although most participants contin-
ued to see the risks to their outlook s for economic 
growth as being broadly balanced , a number now 
judged those risks to be tilted to the downside.  These 
downside risks in cluded a larger -than-expected drag on 
household and business spending  from higher  energy 
prices , continued fiscal strains in Europe, larger -than-
anticipated effects from supply disruptions in the a f-
termath of the disaster in Japan, continuing fiscal a d-justments at all levels of government in the United 
States , financial disruptions that would be associated 
with a failure to increase the federal debt limit , and the 
possibility that the economic weakness in the first qua r-
ter was signaling less underlying mome ntum going fo r-
ward .  However, participants also noted that the rapid 
decline in the unemployment rate over the past several months suggested the possibility of stronger -than-
anticipated economic growth over coming quarters . 
In their discussion of monetary policy, s ome partic i-
pants expressed the view that in the context of i n-
creased inflation risks  and roughly balanced risks to 
economic growth , the Committee would need to be 
prepared  to begin taking steps toward less -
accommodative policy .  A few of these par ticipants 
thought that economic conditions might warrant action 
to raise the federal funds rate target or to sell assets in the SOMA portfolio later this year, but noted that even with such steps , monetary policy would remain a c-
commodative for some time to come.  However, some  
participants indicated that underlying inflation r e-
mained subdued ; that longer -term inflation expect a-
tions were likely to remain anchored, partly because  
modest changes in labor costs would constrain inflation trends ; and that given the downside risks to economic 
growth , an early exit could unnecessarily damp the on-
going  economic recovery.   
Committee Policy Action  
Commi
ttee members agreed that no changes to the 
Committee ’s asset purchase program or to its target 
range for the federal funds rate were warranted at this meeting.  The information received over the intermeet-ing period indicated that the economic recovery was  
proceeding at a moderate pace, albeit somewhat slower 
than had been anticipated earlier in the year.  O verall 
conditio ns in the labor market were gradually impro v-
ing, and the unemployment rate continued to decline, 
although  it remained elevated relative to levels that the 
Committee judged to be consistent, over the longer run, with its statutory mandate of maximum employ-
ment and price stability.  Significant increases in energy 
and other commodity prices ha d boosted overall infla-
tion, but members expected  this increase to be transito-
ry and to unwind when commodity price increases  
abated.  Notwithstanding recent modest incr eases, indi-
cators of medium -term inflation remain ed subdued  and 
somewhat be low the levels seen as consistent with the 
dual mandate as indicated by the Committee ’s longer -
run inflation projections .  Near-term inflation expect a-
tions ha d increased with energy  prices  and overall infla-
tion.  Recent movements in measures of longer -term

inflation expectations  were discussed .  While some 
measures of longer -term inflation expectations had  ris-
en, others were little changed  or down, on net,  since 
March , and members ag reed that longer -term inflation 
expectations  had remain ed stable .  Given this economic 
outlook, the Committee agreed to continue to expand 
its holdings of longer -term Treasury securities as a n-
nounced in November in order to promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that i n-
flation, over time, is at levels consistent with the Co m-
mittee ’s mandate.  Specifically, the Committee mai n-
tained its existing policy of reinvesting principal pa y-
ments from its securities holdings and affirmed that it  
will complete purchases of  $600 billion of longer -term 
Treasury securities by the end of the current quarter.  A few members remained uncertain  about the benefits of 
the asset purchase program but, with the program nea r-
ly completed , judged that making cha nges to the pr o-
gram at this time was not appropriate.  T he Committee 
continued to anticipate that economic conditions, i n-
cluding low rates of resource utilization, subdued infla-tion trends, and stable inflation expectations, were lik e-
ly to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.  That said , a few 
members viewed the increase in inflation risks as su g-
gesting that economic conditions might well  evolve in a 
way that would warrant  the Committee ta king steps 
toward less -accommodative policy sooner  than curren t-
ly anticipated .  
Members agreed that t he Committee will regularly r e-
view the size and composition of its securities hol dings 
in light of incoming information and that they are pr e-
pared to adjust those holdings as ne eded to best foster 
maximum employment and price stability.  Some  
members pointed out that there would need to be a 
significant change in the economic ou tlook , or the risks 
to that  outlook, before another program of asset pu r-
chases would be warranted ; in their view , absent such 
change s, the benefits  of additional purchases would be 
unlikely to outweigh the costs .   
In the statement to be released following the mee ting, 
members decided to indicate  that the economic reco v-
ery was proceeding at a moderate pace and that overall 
conditions in the labor market were gradually improv-
ing.  The Committee also decided to summarize its cu r-
rent thi nking about inflation pressures and to empha -
size that it will closely monitor the evolution of infla-
tion and inflation expecta tions.   Members anti cipated 
that the Chairman, who would deliver his first pos t-
meeting press briefing later that afternoon, would pro-vide add itional  context for the Committee ’s policy d e-
cisions.  
At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to a uthorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to ex-ecute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  
“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will fo s-
ter price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long -run o b-
jectives, the Committee seeks conditions in r e-
serve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to execute  pur-
chases of longer -term Treasury securities in 
order to increase the total face value of dome s-
tic securities held in the System Open Market Account to approximately $2.6 trillion by the end of June 2011.  The Committee  also directs 
the Desk to reinvest principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage -backed s e-
curities in longer -term Treasury securities.  The 
System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee i n-
formed of ongoing developments regarding the System’s balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee’s ob-
jectives of maximum employment and price 
stability.”  
The vote encompassed approval of the statement be-low to be released at 12:30 p.m.:  
“Information re ceived since the Federal Open 
Market Committee met in March indicates that the economic recovery is proceeding at a mo d-
erate pace and overall conditions in the labor 
market are improving gradually.  Household 
spending and business investment in equi p-
ment and software continue to expand.  How-ever, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed.  Commodity prices have risen significantly since last summer, and concerns about global supplies of crude oil have contr i-
buted to a further increase in oil prices since the Committee met in March.  Inflation has picked up in recent months, but longer -term 
inflation expectations have remained stable and measures of underlying inflation are still subdued.

Consiste nt with its statutory mandate, the 
Committee seeks to foster maximum employ-
ment and price stability.  The unemployment rate remains elevated, and measures of unde r-
lying inflation continue to be somewhat low, 
relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate.  Increases in the prices of energy and other commodities have pushed up inflation in recent months.  The Committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close a t-
tention to the evolution of inflation and infla-
tion expectations.  The Committee continues 
to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stabil i-
ty.  
To promote a stronger pace of economic r e-
covery and to help ensure that inflation, over 
time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to continue e x-
panding its holdings of securities as announced in November.  In particular, the Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings and will complete purchases of $600 billion of longer -term Treasury securities by the end of 
the current quarter.  The Committee will reg u-
larly review the size and composition of its s e-
curities holdings in light of incomin g inform a-
tion and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.  
The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utiliza-tion, subdued inflation trends, and stable infla-tion expectations, are likely to warrant exce p-
tionally low levels for the federal funds rate for 
an extended period.  
The Committee will continue to monitor the  
economic outlook and financial developments 
and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help e n-
sure that inflation, over time, is at levels co n-
sistent with its mandate. ”

Dudley, Elizabeth Duke, Charles L. Evans, Richard W. Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota, Charles I. Plosser,  Sarah Bloom Raskin, Daniel K. Tarullo, and Janet L. Yellen.

Summary of Economic Projections 
 
In conjunction with the April 26–27, 2011, Federal 
Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the mem-
bers of the Board of Governors and the presidents of 
the Federal Reserve Banks, a ll of whom participate in 
the deliberations of the FOMC, submitted projections for growth of real output, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation for the years 2011 to 2013 and over the longer 
run.  The projections were based on information avail-able through the end of the meeting and on each par-ticipant’s assumptions about factors likely to affect 
economic outcomes, including his or her assessment of 
appropriate monetary policy.  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the futu re path of policy that each 
participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for 
economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or 
her interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s dual objec-tives of maximum employment and stable prices.  Longer-run projections represent each participant’s 
assessment of the rate to which each variable would be 
expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks.

the economic recovery to continue at a moderate pace, 
with growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) picking up modestly this year (relative to 2010) and 
strengthening further in 2012 and a bit more in 2013.  
With the pace of economic growth exceeding their  
estimates of the longer-run sustainable rate of increases in real GDP, the unemployment rate is projected to gradually trend lower over this projection period.  
However, participants anticipated that, at the end of 
2013, the unemployment rate  would still be well above 
their estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate.  Most participants expected that overall inflation would 
move up this year, but they projected this increase to 
be temporary, with overall inflation moving back in line with core inflation in 2012 and 2013 and remaining at 
or below rates they see as consistent, over the longer 
run, with the Committee’s dual mandate of maximum 
employment and price stability.  Participants generally saw core inflation gradually edging higher over the next two years from its current relatively low level. 
On balance, as indicated in table 1, participants antic-
ipated somewhat lower GDP growth and slightly high-er inflation over the forecast  period than they projected 
in January.  Participants marked down their forecasts 
for real GDP growth this year, revised them down by 
less for 2012 and 2013, and did not alter their expecta-tions for economic growth in the longer run.  Most participants also lowered their forecasts for the average 
unemployment rate at the end of this year, but they 
continued to see the unemployment rate moving down slowly in 2012 and 2013 to levels that were little changed from the previous projections.  Participants 
raised their forecasts for overall inflation this year; 
however, most expected that the increase would be

transitory and made only minor changes to their fore-
casts for the rate of inflation in 2012 and 2013 or for 
the longer run.  Most participants anticipated that five 
or six years would likely be required for the economy to converge fully to its longer-run path characterized by rates of output growth, unemployment, and inflation 
consistent with their interpretation of the Federal Re-
serve’s dual objectives. 
A sizable majority of participants continued to judge 
the level of uncertainty associated with their projections 
for real economic activity and inflation as unusually 
high relative to historical norms.  About one-half of the participants viewed the risks to output growth as ba-lanced, but a number now judged those risks to be 
tilted to the downside.  Meanwhile, a majority of partic-
ipants viewed the risks to overall inflation as weighted to the upside. 
The Outlook 
Participants marked down their forecasts for real GDP 
growth in 2011, with the central tendency of their pro-jections moving down to 3.1 to  3.3 percent from       
3.4 to 3.9 percent in January.   Participants stated that 
the change reflected importantly the somewhat slower-than-expected pace of expansion in the first quarter.  Participants generally thought that much of the unex-pected weakness in the first quarter would prove tem-
porary, but they viewed a number of recent develop-
ments as potential restraints on the pace of economic recovery in the near term.  Those developments in-cluded the effects of the rise in energy prices on real 
income and consumer sentiment, indications that the 
recovery in the housing market was further off, and constraints on state and local government budgets. 
Looking further ahead, participants’ revisions to their 
forecasts for economic growth were modest, and they 
continued to see the economic recovery strengthening over the forecast period, with the central tendency of their projections for growth in real GDP stepping up to 
3.5 to 4.2 percent in 2012 and remaining near those 
rates in 2013.  Participants cited the effects of contin-
ued monetary policy accommodation, further im-
provements in banking and financial market conditions, 
rising consumer confidence as labor market conditions 
strengthen gradually, improved household balance sheets, stabilizing commodity prices, continued expan-sion in business investment in equipment and software, 
and gains in U.S.  exports as being among the likely 
contributors to a sustained pickup in the pace of ex-pansion.  However, participants also saw a number of factors that would likely continue to hinder the pace of expansion over the next two years.  Most participants anticipated that the recovery in the housing market 
would remain slow, restrained by the overhang of va-
cant properties and depressed home values; most also expected increasing fiscal drag at the federal, state, and local levels.  In addition, some participants noted the 
negative impact on household purchasing power of the elevated levels of energy and food prices.  In the ab-sence of further shocks, participants generally expected that, over time, real GDP growth would eventually set-
tle down at an annual rate of 2.5 to 2.8 percent, a pace 
that appeared to be sustai nable in view of expected 
long-run trends in labor supply and labor productivity.  
Reflecting the decline in the unemployment rate in re-
cent months, participants lowered their forecasts for 
the average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year, with the central tendency of their projections at 8.4 to 8.7 percent, down from 8.8 to 9.0 percent in 
January.  Participants’ projections for the jobless rate at the end of 2012 and 2013 were little changed from their 
previous forecasts.  Consistent with their expectations of a moderate economic recovery, most participants 
projected that the unemployment rate would be        
6.8 to 7.2 percent even in late 2013—still well above the 5.2 to 5.6 percent central tendency of their esti-mates of the unemployment rate that would prevail 
over the longer run in the absence of further shocks.  
The central tendency for the participants’ projections of the unemployment rate in the longer run was some-what narrower than the 5 to 6 percent interval reported 
in January. 
Participants noted that the prices of oil and other 
commodities had risen signif icantly since the time of 
their January projections, largely reflecting geopolitical 
developments and robust global demand.  Those in-
creases had led to a sharp rise in consumer energy pric-es and, to a lesser extent, food prices, which had boosted overall inflation.  As a result, participants 
raised their forecasts for total personal consumption 
expenditures (PCE) inflation in 2011, with the central 
tendency of their estimates significantly higher.  With 
the outlook for oil and other commodity prices uncer-
tain, the dispersion of the projections was noticeably 
wider than in January.  Most  participants expected that 
overall inflation would run 2. 1 to 2.8 percent this year, 
compared with 1.3 to 1.7 pe rcent in their January pro-
jections.  However, many participants anticipated that the pass-through of higher commodity prices into core inflation would be contained by downward pressures on inflation from large margins of slack in resource 
utilization and consequent subdued labor costs.  Partic-

ipants indicated that well- anchored inflation expecta-
tions, combined with the appropriate stance of mone-
tary policy, should help keep inflation in check.  As a 
result, participants anticipated that the increase in total PCE inflation would be temporary, with the central tendency of their estimates moving down to              
1.2 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2013—at or below the 1.7 to 2.0 percent central ten-dency for their estimates of the longer-run, mandate-consistent rate of inflation.  Nonetheless, the central 
tendencies of participants’ projections for core PCE 
inflation for this year and ne xt year shifted up a bit to 
1.3 to 1.6 percent in 2011 and 1.3 to 1.8 percent in 2012.  The central tendency of the core PCE inflation 
projections in 2013 was 1.4 to 2.0 percent, little 
changed from the January SEP. 
Uncertainty and Risks 
A sizable majority of participants continued to judge 
that the levels of uncertainty associated with their pro-
jections for economic activity and inflation were greater than the average levels that had prevailed over the past 20 years.
1  They pointed to a number of factors contri-
buting to their assessments of the uncertainty that they attached to their projections, including structural dislo-cations in the labor market, the outlook for fiscal poli-cy, the future path of energy and other commodity 
prices, the global economic outlook, and the effects of 
unconventional monetary policy. 
About one-half of the participants continued to view 
the risks to their outlooks for economic growth as ba-
lanced, but a number of participants now judged that 
those risks had become tilt ed to the downside.  The 
most frequently mentioned downside risks to GDP growth included the possibilit y of further increases in 
energy and other commodity prices, a tighter-than-anticipated stance of fiscal policy in the United States, an even weaker-than-expected housing sector adversely affecting consumer spending and the health of financial 
institutions, and possible sp illovers from the fiscal 
strains in Europe.  A few pa rticipants saw the risks to 
growth as tilted to the upside; it was noted that the cy-
clical rebound in economic activity might prove strong-
er  than   anticipated.    Th e  risks  surrounding  partici-

change in real GDP, the unem ployment rate, and total con-
sumer price inflation over the period from 1991 to 2010.  At 
the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty in the 
economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess 
the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ projec-
tions. Table 2.   Average historical projection error ranges

there is about a 70 percent probabili ty that actual outcomes for real 
GDP, unemployment, and consumer prices will be in ranges implied by 
the average size of projection errors  made in the past. Further informa-

pants’ forecasts of the unemployment rate remained 
broadly balanced and continue d to reflect in large part 
the risks attending participants’ views of the likely 
strength of the expansion in real activity. 
Whereas most participants’ assessments of the risks 
associated with their overall inflation projections over 
the period from 2011 to 2013 were broadly balanced in 
January, a majority of participants now judged the risks 
as weighted to the upside.  Although participants gen-erally indicated that the amount of pass-through of higher oil and other commodity prices into core infla-
tion had so far remained limited and that inflation ex-
pectations continued to be stable, some participants noted the risk that the extent of pass-through might increase and that the resulting rise in inflation could 
unmoor longer-term inflation expectations.  A few par-
ticipants noted the possibility that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy could be maintained for too long, leading to higher inflation ex-
pectations and actual inflation.   
Diversity of Views 
Figures 2.A and 2.B provide further details on the di-versity of participants’ views regarding the likely out-
comes for real GDP growth and the unemployment 
rate in 2011, 2012, 2013, and over the longer run.  The dispersion in these projections generally continued to reflect differences in participants’ assessments of many 
factors, including the likely evolution of conditions in 
credit and financial markets, the current degree of un-derlying momentum in economic activity, the timing and the degree to which th e labor market will recover 
from the dislocations associated with the deep reces-sion, the outlook for economic and financial develop-

ments abroad, and appropriate future monetary policy 
and its effects on economic activity.  Regarding partici-
pants’ projections for real GDP growth, the distribu-
tion for this year shifted noticeably lower and was sig-nificantly more tightly concentrated than the distribu-tion in January, with more than one-half of participants 
expecting the change in real GDP in 2011 to be in the 
3.2 to 3.3 percent interval.  By contrast, the distribu-tions for real GDP growth in 2012 and 2013 were little 
changed.  Regarding partic ipants’ projections for the 
unemployment rate, the distribution for this year shifted down relative to the distribution in January, with about one-half of participants anticipating the un-employment rate in the final quarter of 2011 to be 8.4 
to 8.5 percent; this shift likely reflects the recent im-
provements in labor market conditions.  The distribu-tions of the unemployment rate for 2012 and 2013 were little changed.  The distribution of participants’ 
estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate was 
somewhat more tightly concentrated than in January, while that for their estimates of longer-run GDP growth was about unchanged. 
Corresponding information ab out the diversity of par-
ticipants’ views regarding the inflation outlook is pro-
vided in figures 2.C and 2.D.  In general, the dispersion 
in the participants’ inflation forecasts for the next few 
years represented differences in judgments regarding the fundamental determinants of inflation, including 
estimates of the degree of resource slack and the extent 
to which such slack influences inflation outcomes and 
expectations, as well as estimates of how the stance of monetary policy may influence inflation expectations.  Regarding overall PCE inflation, the distribution of 
participants’ proj ections for 2011 shifted noticeably 
higher relative to the distribution in January, reflecting 
the recent increases in energy and other commodity prices, but the dispersion in forecasts was little 
changed.  The distributions for 2012 and 2013 were 
generally little changed and re mained fairly wide.  Re-
garding core PCE inflation, the distribution of partici-pants’ projections for 2011 shifted noticeably to the 
right, but it remained about as wide as in January.  The 
distributions of core inflation for 2012 and 2013 also shifted somewhat higher but were otherwise little changed.  Although the distributions of participants’ 
inflation forecasts for 2011 through 2013 continued to 
be relatively wide, the distribution of projections of the 
longer-run rate of overall PCE inflation remained tightly concentrated.  The narrow range illustrates the 
broad similarity in particip ants’ assessments of the ap-
proximate level of inflation that is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual objectives of maximum em-ployment and price stability.

Forecast Uncertainty 
  
 The economic projections provided by 
the members of the Board of Governors and 
the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks 
inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understand-ing of the basis for policy actions.  Consider-able uncertainty attends these projections, 
however.  The economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce eco-nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect de-scriptions of the real world.  And the future 
path of the economy can be affected by myr-
iad unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider no t only what appears to 
be the most likely economic outcome as em-bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the 
economy should they occur. 
Table 2 summarizes the average historical 
accuracy of a range of forecasts, including 
those reported in past Monetary Policy Report s 
and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.  The pro-jection error ranges shown in the table il-
lustrate the considerable  uncertainty associated 
with economic forecasts.  For example, sup-
pose a participant projects that real gross do-mestic product (GDP) and total consumer 
prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, re-
spectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty attending those projections is sim- ilar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a 
probability of about 70 percent that actual 
GDP would expand within a range of 2.0 to 4.0 percent in the current year, 1.4 to 4.6 percent in the second year, and 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the 
third year.  The corre sponding 70 percent con-
fidence intervals for overall inflation would be 
1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years. 
Because current conditions may differ 
from those that prevailed, on average, over his-tory, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their pro-
jections of each variable is greater than, smaller 
than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty in the past as shown in table 2.  Participants also provide judgments as 
to whether the risks to their projections are 
weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, participants judge whether each variable is 
more likely to be above or below their projec-
tions of the most likely outcome.  These judg-ments about the uncertainty and the risks at-tending each participant’s projections are dis-
tinct from the diversity of participants’ views 
about the most likely outcomes.  Forecast un-certainty is concerned with the risks associated with a particular projection rather than with 
divergences across a number of different pro-
jections.
