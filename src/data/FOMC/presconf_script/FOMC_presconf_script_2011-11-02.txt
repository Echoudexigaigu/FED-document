CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  Welcome.  In my opening remarks, I will briefly review today’s policy decision of the Federal Open our policy strategy.  I will then be glad to take your questions.   As indicated in its statement, the Committee decided today to maintain the policies that were initiated at previous meetings.  In particul ar, the Committee is keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and c ontinues to anticipate that  economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. The Committee will continue the program th at we announced in September to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s ho ldings of securities by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities and selling an equal amount  of shorter-term Treas ury securities.  Our purchases of longer-term securiti es exert downward pressures on longe r-term interest rates; at the same time, our guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate should limit the effect of our sales of shorter-term securities on shorter-term interest ra tes.  Consequently, this maturity extension program should foster more accommod ative financial conditions, thereby helping support a stronger recovery withou t changing the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In addition, to further ease conditions in mortgage markets, we are continuing our previously announced program in which the prin cipal payments from our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities ar e being reinvested in  agency MBS.  The Committee regularly reviews the size and com position of our securities holdings, and we are prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.   2 of 22  In conjunction with today’s meeting, the FO MC participants submitted projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and th e inflation rate for the years 2011 to 2014 and over the longer run.  The central tendencies and ranges of those pr ojections are depicted in the figures that have been distributed.  The longer -run projections—shown at the right side of each figure—represent participants’ assessments of the rate to which each variable will converge, over time, assuming appropriate monetary policy a nd no further shocks to the economy.   The longer-run projections for growth of r eal GDP have a central tendency of 2.4 to 2.7 percent, and the longer-run projections for th e unemployment rate have a central tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  These projections can be inte rpreted, respectively, as participants’ estimates of the economy’s normal or tre nd rate of growth and its norm al unemployment rate over the longer run.  Because the economy's longer- r un normal rates of output growth and unemployment are determined largely by nonmoneta ry factors that may evolve over time and that cannot often be directly measured, these es timates are inherently unc ertain and subject to revision.   The central tendency of the longer-run projectio ns for inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is  1.7 to 2.0 percent.  The inflation outlook over the longer run is determined almost entirely by monetary policy, and hence these projections essentially reflect participants’ j udgments about the inflation rate th at is most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate of fostering maximum em ployment and stable pr ices.  In effect, the “mandate-consistent” inflation rate is j udged to be 2 percent or a bit less.   I turn now to the Committee’s economic outlook.  Participants’ projections for real GDP for 2011 as a whole have a central tendency of 1.6 to 1.7 percent.  Output growth strengthened during the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the tem porary factors that had weighed on 3 of 22  growth earlier in the year.  In  particular, global supply chain di sruptions associated with the natural disaster in Japan have diminished.  Mo reover, the prices of oil and other commodities have come down from their peaks, easing st rains on household budgets and contributing to a somewhat faster pace of consumer spending in recent months.   The Committee expects only a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters, reflecting ongoing drags from the troubled housing sector, still-tig ht credit conditions for many households and smaller businesses, volatility in fi nancial markets, fiscal  consolidation at all levels of government, and other factors.  Looking  further ahead, economic growth is expected to pick up somewhat as a result of improving fina ncial conditions, streng thening consumer and business confidence, and the continuation of a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Specifically, the central tendency of participants ’ growth projections picks up gradually from 2.5 to 2.9 percent in 2012 to 3.0 to 3.9 percent by 2014.   In light of the anticipated moderate pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually over coming quart ers.  Participants’ projections for the unemployment rate in the four th quarter of 2012 have a central tendency of 8.5 to 8.7 percent—only about ½ pe rcentage point lowe r than the latest monthly reading of 9.1 percent.  The unemployment rate is expected  to climb further to 6.8 to 7.7 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014—still well above participants ’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.   In short, while we still expect that econo mic activity and labor market conditions will improve gradually over time, the pace of progress is  likely to be frustratingly slow.  Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the ec onomic outlook.  Most not ably, concerns about European fiscal and banking issues have contribut ed to strains in global financial markets, which 4 of 22  have likely had adverse effects on confidence and growth.  Eur opean leaders have recently announced a number of steps to address those issues.  We will continue to monitor European developments closely.   I’ll turn now to the ou tlook for inflation.  The prices of  oil and other commodities rose sharply earlier this year.  Consumer inflation consequently picked up ove r the first half of 2011, reflecting higher prices of ga soline, food, and other goods and services for which producers passed higher input costs along to their customers.  In addition, pr ices of motor vehicles surged in response to the global supply disruptions associ ated with the disaster  in Japan.  However, inflation appears to have moderate d as those transitory influences  have waned, and as low levels of resource utilization constrain rises in prices and wages.  Furthermore, survey measures and Consequently, the Committee anticipates that, over coming quarters, inflation will settle at or below its mandate-consistent rate of 2 pe rcent or a bit less.  Specifically, the central tendency of participants’ inflati on projections is 2.7 to 2.9 percent for this year but declines to 1.4 to 2.0 percent in 2012 and remains subdued through 2014.  The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflati on expectations.   The current economic outlook provides impor tant context for understanding today’s policy decision.  The Committee’s mandate from th e Congress is to seek maximum employment and price stability.  With unemployment well abov e normal levels and expected to decline only slowly, and with inflation exp ected to remain at or below mandate-consistent levels, the Committee decided today to maintain the current high degree of monetary policy accommodation.  We will continue to assess th e economic outlook in light of incoming 5 of 22  information, and we are prepared to employ our  tools as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a cont ext of price stability.   Finally, I would like to note th at the Committee strives to explain its monetary policy public communications.  Specifically, we have been  engaging in a series of discussions about potential approaches to providing the public ad ditional information about our monetary policy goals and policy strategy, as we ll as about our outlook for the ec onomy and for the future stance of monetary policy.  However, no decisions about su ch approaches were made  at this meeting.   Thank you for your patience, and I would be happy to take your questions.   STEVE LIESMAN.  Mr. Chairman, over the pa st several months, it seems there’s been increasing criticism of the Fed’s policy.  You received a letter on the eve of the September meeting urging you not to take action from th e GOP leadership.  Se veral GOP presidential candidates have criticized Fed policy in the debates.   On the first issue, do you feel that crossed the line?  Was it appropriate in terms of the concepts of the Fed’s independence?  On the second question, what are the GOP presidential candi dates not hearing or understanding about Fed policy, in your opinion?  

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, politics is politics, and the Federal Reserve tries to stay nonpartisan and out of those debates.  I mea n, our job is to do the best we can for the U.S. economy, to do what we can to promote our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, and although we must be accountable to the Congress over the longe r term, in the short term, it’s very important that the Fed be free fr om political pressures.  And therefore, we are going to make our decisions based on what’s go od for the economy, and we’re not going to take any politics into account.   6 of 22  Now, the concerns that have been expressed re late to the possibility that the Fed’s highly expansionary policies might be cont ributing to inflation risk.  I woul d simply point to the record.  If you look back for the last five years, in flation—although it’s been  volatile be cause of commodity price fluctuations—has averaged about 2 percent, which is close to a reasonable definition of price stability, whereas the area wh ere we have fallen shor t, obviously, is on the unemployment side.  So I think that criticisms ba sed on the concern about inflation have so far, at least, not proved to  be very valid.   

[SECTION]

STEVE LIESMAN.  Was th e letter appropriate? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I’m not going to comment on that.  I—we listen to everybody’s input, and the most important thing is that we are free to make the decision based on the interest of the American peopl e, what’s in the interest of the economy, and that’s what we’re going to do. 

[SECTION]

BINYAMIN APPELBAUM.  Has the Fed discusse d the idea of nominal GDP targeting?  And what are your views on the advantages a nd disadvantages of that approach?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So the Fed’s mandate is, of course, a dual mandate.  We have a mandate for both employment and for pric e stability, and we have  a framework in place that allows us to communicate and to think a bout the two sides of that  mandate.  We talked today—or yesterday, actually—about nominal GDP as  an indicator, as an information variable, as something to add to the list of variables that  we think about, and it was a very interesting discussion.  However, we think th at within the existing framework that we have, which looks at both sides of the mandate, not just some combin ation of the two, we can communicate whatever we need to communicate about future monetary policy.  So we are not contemplating at this 7 of 22  date—at this time—any radical change in fram ework.  We are going to stay within the dual-mandate approach that we’ve b een using until this point.   

[SECTION]

JENNIFER LIBERTO.  Chairman, you’ve said in the past you understand some of the anger on display with the Occupy Wall Street proteste rs.  And a lot of the anger is directed at the Fed, with some protesters saying that the Fed is part of the problem, that the Fed preserves the financial system and promotes income inequality.  Can—are the protesters right?  Is the Fed part of the problem?  And, secondarily, can the Fe d do anything to promote a more equitable economy?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, as I’ve said  before, I certainly understand that many people are dissatisfied with the state of the econo my.  I’m dissatisfied with the state of the economy.  Unemployment is far to o high.  Inequality, which is not a new phenomenon, has been going on—increases in inequality have been going on for at least 30 years, but obviously as that has continued, we now have a more unequal society than we’ve had in the past.  So again, I fully sympathize with the notion that the economy is not performing the way we would like it to be, and in that respect, the concerns that people express across the spectru m are understandable.   I think that the concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions.  The Federal Reserve was involved, obviously, in trying to stabilize the fina ncial system in 2008 and 2009.  A very simplistic interpreta tion of that was that we were doing th at because we wanted to preserve, you know, bankers’ salaries.  That is obviously not the case.  What  we were doing is trying to protect the financial system in order to prevent a serious collap se of both the financial system and the American economy.  We needed to take  those steps.  If we hadn’t taken them, the consequences would have been dire.  And not  everybody understands that, and therefore they sometimes misunderstand our motives.  Our motives ar e strictly to do what’s in the interest of 8 of 22  the broad public, and I believe that our efforts to  stabilize the financial system, which ultimately proved successful, were very much in the interest of th e broad public.   With respect to the current economy, as I de scribed earlier, we are currently continuing with our accommodative monetary policy.  We are trying to do our be st to support economic growth and job creation.  I think it would be help ful if we could get assistance from some other parts of the government to work with us, to he lp create more jobs.  But certainly, we are doing our part to try to create more jobs  and more opportunities in America.   With respect to inequality, I think the best way to address inequality is to create jobs.  It gives people opportunities.  It gives people a chance to earn in come, gain experience, and to ultimately earn more.  But that’s an indirect a pproach; that’s really the only way the Fed can address inequality per se.   

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  Jon Hilsenrath from the Wall Street Journal .  Mr. Chairman, the Fed’s forecast for 2013 shows the unemploymen t rate finishing the year between 7.8 and 8.2 percent.  The statement says th at short-term rates will stay near  their current levels at least through mid-2013.  Does that suggest that the Fed c ould conceive of raising short-term interest rates before unemployment even ge ts to 8 percent or much lower?  And if not, could you explain how people should interpret those two messages?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the statement says “at least” mid-2013.  So, clearly, it could well be some point beyond that, and market s are currently anticipa ting a somewhat later liftoff.  One of the things we discussed yesterday in our comm unications discussion was how we might further clarify that part of the statement and try to provide more information about what conditions would prevail at the tim e that we would be considering raising rates.  But we haven’t come to that point yet, but we certainly would li ke to provide more clarity about that.  But again, 9 of 22  let me emphasize that what we are saying now is “at least”; ther e’s no implication that we would necessarily move in mid-2013 with those conditions prevai ling that you described.   

[SECTION]

PEDRO DACOSTA.  Pedro DaCost a from Reuters.  Mr. Chairm an, what is your appetite for a renewed push into large-scale mortgage-bac ked securities purchases?  The Fed had stated the intention to move the struct ure of its balance sheet more to  its original, you know, Treasuries-only composition.  But recently, it revived the MBS program through the reinvestments, and folks like Governor Tarullo and William Dudley have raised the possibility of further large-scale asset purchases on the MBS side.  Could you comment on your views on that particular proposal?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, I’ll be glad to.  You were absolutely correct—first, that ultimately we would like to return our portfol io to Treasuries only.  That may be some time down the road at this point.  Y ou’re also correct that as part of our policy action at the last meeting, we began to reinvest mortgage-backed  securities and agency  debt back into  mortgage-backed securities, thereby providing some  additional support for the mortgage market.  The housing sector is a very importa nt sector.  It’s—the problems in  that sector are clearly a big reason why our economy is not recovering more quickly.  So I do thi nk that purchases of mortgage-backed securities is a viable option.  It ’s certainly something we would consider if conditions were appropriate.  So the answer is yes, we w ould certainly look at that.  

[SECTION]

GREG ROBB.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Greg Robb, MarketWatch.com.  At the moment now, banks are holding hundr eds of billions of dollars in excess reserves, and at the same time, corporations seem to be holding lo ts of cash on the—and foreigners—at the same time, foreigners keep investing a lot of money in the United Stat es.  The current account deficit 10 of 22  is very large.  Could you shed some light on that situation?  Is there something that foreigners know that U.S. companies don’t abou t investing in the U.S.?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, most of the— a great deal of the investment in the U.S. takes the form of purchases of U.S. governme nt debt in Treasury secu rities.  And that, in turn, reflects the desire for the liquidity and safe ty provided by the U.S. Treasury market.  For example, as you know, two of the largest holders  of U.S. Treasury securities are China and Japan, who hold those securities primarily as fore ign exchange reserves and, in the case of China, in an effort to keep their exchange ra te from appreciating too quickly.  So, I was—while it’s good that foreign central banks and so on have the confidence to buy U.S. Treasuries, it’s not quite the same as investing in pl ant and equipment.  We’ve seen a little bit of improvement there, but it’s still obviously  too low to be consistent w ith a full employment economy.   

[SECTION]

PETER BARNES.  Peter Barnes, Fox Business.  Sir, could you comment on the failure of MF Global, which is a primary dealer?  And specifically, the Financial Times  is reporting that the leverage ratio at MF Global was 40 to 1.  Were you aware of that?  Did the Fed approve of that?  Is that an acceptable leverage ratio, pa rticularly since the fi nancial crisis?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Certainly.  The New York Federal Reserve Bank approved MF Global to be a primary dealer; I believe it was in February of this year.  At that time, the company met the criteria that had been set fo rth in terms of management, financial condition, capacity, and so on to qualify to be a primary deal er.  We have set those standards in a way that would allow smaller firms like MF Global to part icipate in the primary dealer market.  But I would like to emphasize, I guess, a couple of point s.  First, we are not the regulators of MF Global.  That’s done by the SEC and the CFTC , so we do not have ongoing insight into developments within the company.  And secondl y, again, making them a primary dealer did not 11 of 22  in any way constitute a seal of approval.  In  fact, the New York Fed’s website contains a statement pretty much to that effect.  So, they  were a primary dealer, we stopped trading with them before they failed, and we’ve suffered no losses or other consequences from our transactions with the company.  Again, in terms of your questi on about leverage and financial condition, the company declined very, very quick ly based on, apparently, a small number of large bets.  As far as I know we were not awar e of that, but again, to emphasize, we were not—we are not the overseers, the re gulators of that company.   

[SECTION]

PEDRO DACOSTA.  Can I just as k whether you see it as an is olated case or whether this is the start of some thing broader?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The question is, Was that  an isolated case?   It appears to be an idiosyncratic case, and we’re monitori ng the possible impacts on funding markets and elsewhere.  And, so far, we’ve not seen any significant impact on fi nancial stability.   

[SECTION]

JON HILSENRATH.  To follow up on that question, should the Fed be, on an ongoing basis, monitoring its primary dealers?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The question is, Sh ould the Fed be monitoring its primary dealers?  Only if the Fed is the supervis or.  In this case, the combination of a  broker–dealer and a futures commission merchant  imply that the SEC and the CFTC are the appropriate supervisors.  They would not have qualified—this company would not have qualified as a SIFI under the provisional guidance issued by the FSOC, so there’s no basis at this point for the Fed to be the overseer of that, of those companies.   

[SECTION]

NEIL IRWIN.  Neil Irwin with the Washington Post .  Mr. Chairman, this is the third straight set of economic projecti ons you’ve released that have downgraded forecasts for growth and for employment.  I wonder, is there some sy stematic error, some blind spot that’s behind 12 of 22  these, kind of, overly optimistic forecasts?  Wh at are you doing internally to understand what you got wrong the last few projections?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it’s a pe rfectly fair question.  And, you know, we spend a lot of time reviewing those errors.  The staff, in particular , presents us with information on forecast errors and on revisions, et cetera, and so we look at th at very carefully.  I think it’s clear that—in retrospect, that the severity of th e financial crisis and a number of other problems, including the dysfunction of  the housing market, have been more severe and more persistent than we initially believed, and that, together with a number of other phenomena like deleveraging by the household sector and so on, has slowed the pace of recovery.  So, yes, we have again downgraded the medium-term forecast.  Evid ently, the forces—you know, the drags on the recovery were stronger than we thought.   I would add, however, though, that although I th ink it’s very importa nt to look at the fundamental factors affecting th e recovery, there’ve been some elements of bad luck.  For example, this year, the combination of the natu ral disaster in Japan wh ich had global impacts in terms of growth, oil price increases , the European debt crisis, whic h was not anticipated to be as severe and create as much volatility as it has in  financial markets—all those things have been negatives for growth, and they do explain at  least part of the downward revision.   

[SECTION]

MICHAEL MCKEE.  Michael McKee with Bloomberg Television.  Many Americans wonder what the Fed has actually accomplished w ith its monetary policy actions since about QE2.  Fed officials like to talk  about the effect they’ve had on  interest rates, but the economy seems insensitive to interest rates these days .  Can you explain what you have managed to accomplish?  Can you tell us whether you feel your mandate requires you to do anything you can think of on an ongoing basis until some targets ar e met?  And can you ex plain to the average 13 of 22  American why you’re doing what yo u’re doing?  And do you think that  you risk credibility if the average American doesn’t s ee some sort of improvement in the economy?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, it’s a fair quest ion.  I would first say that monetary policy is having effects on the economy.  And we’v e talked about the effects on asset prices, but we have continued to analyze the effects of chan ges in interest rates, for example, on decisions like investment or car purchases.  One area wher e monetary policy has been blunted—the effects have been blunted—has been the mortgage mark et, where very tight credit standards have prevented many people from purchasing or refi nancing their homes, and therefore the low mortgage rates that we’ve achieved have not been  as effective as we had hoped.  So, monetary policy may be somewhat less powerful in the curren t context than it has been in the past, but nevertheless, it is affecting econom ic growth and job creation.   If you ask about the accomplishments, I would first of all mention a very important one, which is that we have kept inflation close to 2 percent, on average, which both has avoided the problems of high inflation but al so very importantly has avoide d the risk of deflation.  And we’ve seen in other countries, in other contexts, that deflation can be a very pernicious problem and very difficult to get out of once you are there.  So we have been able to achieve, on average, stable prices.   With respect to growth, I think that our polic ies, including the cutti ng of rates to zero in were very important for helpi ng to explain why the economy st opped contracting and began to grow again in the middle of 2009.  I think there’s a lot of evidence that that did promote growth and job creation.  I would argue th at we’ve also been successful w ith some of the later actions that we’ve taken, although it’s early to say for things like the maturity extension program, but we 14 of 22  always face the problem of asking the question, Well,  where would we be without these policies?  And our best estimates are that—absent the supp ort of monetary policy, that the economy would be in a much deeper ditch and that unemployment would be much higher th an it is.  That being said, you know, again, people rightly recognize that we have not yet gotten the economy back to where we want it to be, and their dissatisfaction is perfectly understandable .  Yes, I do think that with—you know, that we do need to do whatever we can to move the economy towards price stability and maximum empl oyment.  We’ll continue to do that so long as the tools that we have are efficacious and that they don’t have costs or risk s or negative side effects that are worse than the benefits.  We’ll always be making that evaluation.   

[SECTION]

GREG IP.  Greg Ip with the Economist .  In response to Pedro’s question, you said you would consider more MBS purchases when th e conditions were appropriate.  Could you elaborate on what conditions woul d be appropriate to do additiona l large-scale asset purchases, what your reaction function is right now?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I don’t think I can be as precise as you would like.  I—the MBS purchases and Treasury s ecurities purchases are one set of tools that we have.  The other set of tools that we have  are communication tools, which essentially tie interest rate are basically the two tools that we have, and we need to continue to work on how best to use them and in what combination to use them to achieve our objectives.   In terms of when we would use these, I thi nk all I can say is that the Committee will have to look at the outlook, and if it judges that we are falling sufficiently far short of our objectives in terms of inflation falling at or below its target and growth being insufficient, and that we believe that monetary stimulus would be beneficial , you know, then the Committee obviously would try 15 of 22  to take corrective action.  But I can’t—you know , it’s a Committee decision, we’ll have to look at the outlook.  But we remain prepared to take action as appropriate to make sure the recovery continues, to make sure that we ha ve stable prices in the U.S.   

[SECTION]

JOSHUA ZUMBRUN.  Josh Zumbrun from Bl oomberg.  Your colleague Daniel Tarullo phrased this as, “Further action would be required in the absence of favorable developments.”  Does that mean that, looking at the forecast ta bles we have here today, that if we don’t see improvement from what’s in those tables , that further action would be required? 

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Again, I can’t speak  for my colleagues on the Committee.  I will say that that forecast we have is satisfact ory in one dimension, in the sense that inflation remains low and stable, but it is very unsatisfactory in terms of  the rate of growth of the economy, the rate at which unemployment comes dow n.  So I think the judgment we’re going to have to make is, do the tools we have—are those t ools likely to be sufficiently effective?  Or do they bear costs and risks that would make them  less effective or not worth using?  So it’s a judgment we’re going to have to co ntinue to make.  We’re going to have to continue to evaluate the outlook.  But again, I really can’t speak for my  colleagues until we have looked at the entire array of data and made a decision about that.   

[SECTION]

JOHN BERRY.  John Berry, Fiscal Times .  In the European debt deal that may or may not come to pass, it’s been said that the ba nks operating there—the bi g banks—have all agreed that a 9 percent Tier 1 capital ra tio is appropriate.  A lot of U.S.  banks have been arguing that they can’t afford to do that.  It will reduce lending, but it would also put them at a competitive disadvantage internationally.  With that happeni ng in Europe, do you think it’s appropriate that the big banks in the U.S. should accept such a Tier 1 capital requirement, and how does that development stand at this point?    16 of 22 

[SECTION]

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we are co mmitted to, and are in the process of, implementing Basel III, which has a basic require ment including a buffer of 7 percent, and then additional surcharges for the largest institutions.  We think that’s an a ppropriate framework.  I’m not sure that the 9 percent that Europeans are talk ing about is really comparable to this, to the capital requirements that we are imposing, or will be imposing, on U.S. banks.  For example, the composition of their capital is not, as far as I understand, purely common equity.  I do not know what risk weights are being applied to the a ssets.  So there are a number of questions of comparability.  My expectation and hope is that —over the medium term, that the Europeans who agreed to the Basel III conditions will ensure that their banks meet the Basel III standards over time.  Of course, that’s being pha sed in over a number of years so as not to jeopardize in any way the recovery.  But, over the remainder of this de cade, we anticipate implementing all of the key elements of Basel III in  the United States.   

[SECTION]

LUCA DILEO.  Luca DiLeo with Dow Jones.   Mr. Chairman, you’ve partly addressed this, but there’s something I still fail to understa nd.  Given that your fore cast is still so gloomy for employment through 2014, given that you’re not worried about inflation, and given that you said that MBS is a viable op tion, why not act today?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So, as you point out, our forecast is not a very satisfactory one in the sense that unemployment is very high and growth is very slow.  We have taken a lot of actions.  Let me be very clear that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is highly accommodative now—we brought rates close to zer o, we have done $2 trillion worth of asset purchases, we have made commitments about rates, we’ve extended the maturity of our portfolio—so we have taken a lot of steps, including steps at th e last two meetings, so we are being very aggressive in providing moneta ry accommodation.  I was asked before about 17 of 22  conditions for further accommodation.  Well, we are prepared to do that, and we will continue to observe, you know, how the economy evolves.  You know, what we have is a projection; there’s a lot of uncertainty there.  A nd so it will be very important to  see, you know, what actually happens in terms of financial market conditions and economic growth.  So, but we are prepared to take further action.  We’ve already taken quite  a bit of action, but we’r e prepared to do more, and we have the tools to do more if that’s appropriate.  Again, while I do not shirk the responsibility of the Fed having to do what it can to meet its  mandate, obviously, a broad range of policies can affect growth and employment, a nd I hope that there will be a range of actions that will complement and supplement the Federal Reserve’s efforts.

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I don’t want  to make excuses.  Again, we did overestimate the pace of recovery for some fundamental reasons having to do with, as I mentioned, the time taken to achieve financial repa ir, the state of the hous ing market, and so on.  But that being said, as I indicate d earlier, there has been a certain  amount of bad luck, and I think the volatility in financial market s associated with the European  situation has been—along with volatility associated with the U.S. fiscal conditions , has been a drag on recovery.  I think it’s part of the reason why the second half of 2011 was less strong than we anticipated when I was here at the last press conference in June .  So there has been that concer n.  It’s showing up in Americans’ 18 of 22  confidence and sentiment.  You can see that righ t now consumer confidence is about where it was in the depths of recession; th at’s very discouraging.  To some  extent, at least, it will be a drag on consumer’s willingness to spend and to invest.   My best advice to Americans is to continue to live your lives, though, and to continue to think about your personal situat ion and try to make smart decisions based on your own financial position.  Clearly, Americans are trying to improve their balance sheets; they’re trying to pay down debt.  That’s, of course, important.  At th e same time, you want to  make smart decisions, you want to make good investments,  you want to budget properly.  So  financial literacy is a big part of this, and lack of financia l literacy was one of the things that got us into this mess in the first place.  So I would advise pe ople to try to be smart about th eir finances.  Unfortunately, we can’t disassociate ourselves from Europe; the th ings that are happening there do affect us, and that’s an unfortunate fact.  I hope  very much that the Europeans will find a set of solutions that will allow markets to calm down and take off some  of the headwinds from the U.S. economy.

ROBIN HARDING.  Robi n Harding from the Financial Times .  Mr. Chairman, could you explain the menu of options that the Comm ittee has for improving its communication about when it might raise interest rates and what the conditions are in which it might do that?  For example, might it makes sense for the Fed to publish a forecast of its own future interest rates, and what’s the advantages and disa dvantages of that?  Thank you.   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, again, as I no ted in my opening remarks, no decisions have been made, so I want to be very clear that no final—you know, there is no final outcome here in this discussion.  But cl early, there’s a range of things that we can do.  We can provide more information about our objec tives, for example.  We could provide information about where we want inflation to be in the long term, for exam ple.  We can also provide information about the 19 of 22  future path of interest rates, which we’ve done to some extent via our “mid-2013” language in the statement.  An alte rnative approach, which Charlie Evans a nd others have suggested, is to tie that to economic conditions and to provide more  information about under what circumstances we would raise rates.  That is certain ly something that we have discu ssed and I think is an interesting alternative.  There’s a lot of interest in using the survey of economic projections in constructive ways as we have up until now to provide inform ation to the public about our plans.  And in particular, using the SEP as a way of giving in formation about our future policy decisions is something that’s on the table.  There’s no decision  made about that, but th at’s one direction that we might find productive.

MICHELLE FLEURY.  Michelle Fleury, BBC News.  You mentioned, obviously, that Europe and what’s happening there has an imp act here on the U.S. economy.  To what degree can the Fed do little more than react to events abroad?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it is a bit frustrating.  Obviously, the key ultimately it’s their responsibility  to find solutions to this very difficult problem.  Of course, I and the Treasury Secretary and other economic policymakers in United States do confer and meet with European policymakers on a regular ba sis, and we give our advice, for what it’s worth—sometimes they take it, sometimes they  don’t.  But, obviously, they’re the ones who have to make those decisions.  So what we can do, really, is only a couple of things.  One is that we can look at our own financial institutions a nd try to assess the exposures and the linkages between our institutions and thos e in Europe and the sovereign de bt in Europe, and we’ve been doing that on a consistent basis.  We’ve looked also, of course, with ot her regulators at money 20 of 22  So that’s one thing that we can do.  And the ot her thing that we can do is stand ready, if necessary, to provide whatever support the br oader economy needs and the financial system needs, should things worsen.  I mean, we ar e hopeful that the latest measures, vigorously implemented, will indeed ultimately reduce these st resses, but in the case that things do get worse, both monetary policy and our policies of lender of last resort are available to insulate the U.S. economy from the effects.

KATHERINE LEWIS.  Hi, Katherine Lewis for Bankrate.com.  Can you talk about what impact you’ve seen from Operation Twist on longer-term CD rates and investment-grade bond yields?  And do you have any message for people who are relying on those kinds of instruments for income?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure.  It ’s a little bit early to full y assess the effects of what we call the maturity extension program.  But it do es seem to be having, at least in a preliminary sense—it does seem to be having the intended ef fect of lowering longer-term interest rates and twisting the yield curve, as was an ticipated.  That, in turn, should  lead to still lower mortgage rates and other interest rates wh ich are relevant to the economy.  We are quite aware that very low interest rates, particularly for a protracted period, do have co sts for a lot of people.  They have costs for savers.  We have complaints from  banks that complain that their net interest a protracted period require them to make larg er contributions.  So we are aware of those concerns, and we take th em very seriously.   I think the response is, though, that there is a greater good here, which is the health and recovery of the U.S. economy, and for that purpose we’ve been keeping monetary policy conditions accommodative, trying to support the r ecovery, trying to suppor t job creation.  After 21 of 22  all, savers are not going to get very good return s in an economy which is in a deep recession.  I mean, ultimately, if you want to earn money on your investments, you have to invest in an economy which is growing.  And so, we believe th at our policy will ultimately benefit not just workers and firms and households in general, but will benefit savers as well, as the returns that they can earn on their investments will impr ove with the improvement in the economy.

DARREN GERSH.  Darren Gersh, Nightly Business Report .  Given how hard it has been to bring down unemployment in the past, why ar e you confident you have the tools to bring it down in the future?    

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we have the ability to provide more stimulus and accommodation.  We believe that a good bit of the unemployment that we are seeing is what economists would call cyclical unemployment—th at is, unemployment arising because of inadequate demand in the economy.  If that’s  the case, then a m onetary policy—by lowering interest rates, making financial conditions  more accommodative—should stimulate demand, should stimulate spending, and over a period of time, that will help bring down cyclical unemployment.  That is something that we know  from a lot of experience, and, although it’s been a very slow process here, th ere’s no reason to think that the sa me basic effect will not work in this case as well.   Now, it’s also possible that part of the in crease in unemployment reflects so-called structural factors—mismatches between worker  skills and job opportun ities, loss of skills, geographical mismatch, et cetera.  And to the extent  that that’s the case, then monetary policy is much less effective because in that case, only ot her kinds of labor market policies really can make progress against that type of unemployment.  But again, I do think that  a considerable part of the unemployment that we are seeing is cycli cal and is thus amenable to monetary policy. 22 of 22  Final comment:  Cyclical unemployment, left untreated, so to speak, for a long time can become structural unemployment as people lose skills,  as they lose attachment to the labor force, as their work networks dry up and so on.  So in that  respect, it’s important for us to try to address the unemployment problem in a sense while it ’s still amenable to monetary policy.

BRAIMOH ODION-ESENE.  Braim oh Odion-Esene, Market News International.  You mentioned that the Fed has the tool s and stands ready to use it.  Bu t given that in the statement it says that the Committee saw growth strengthened so mewhat in the third quarter, is it fair to say that the FOMC is less aggressively cons idering more policy accommodation, given the improvement they saw in the third quarter?   

[SECTION]

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We did see some  improvement in the third quarter, a modest improvement.  We saw, for example,  stronger consumption spending, a reasonable amount of capital investment, lower inventorie s, therefore suggesting more production in the fourth quarter, so it looks like the fourth quarter  as well will be a moderate-growth quarter.  So there was some improvement—some improvement, at least early in th e period, in financial acknowledging in our statement, that’s true.  But as has been noted, the medium-term outlook relative to our June projections has been dow ngraded, and the outlook remains unsatisfactory over the next few years.  And we ’ll continue to ask ourselves wh ether or not additional stimulus or additional actions can provide a better outcome , and that’s certainly something that remains on the table and we’ll continue to  evaluate as we go forward.   Thank you.
