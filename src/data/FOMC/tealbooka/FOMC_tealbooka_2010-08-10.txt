Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information that we have received  since the June Tealbook suggests that 
economic activity is expanding at a slower p ace than we were projecting.  After folding 
in data received subsequent to last week’s GDP  release, we estimate that real GDP rose at 
an annual rate of about 2 percent in the second quarter, an increase that is about 
¼ percentage point less than the BEA reporte d last week and 1½ percentage points less 
than our forecast in June.1  Moreover, based on the incoming indicators, the economy 
seems to be on track for a disappointing gain in  the third quarter as well.  Much of the 
unexpected weakness has been in the house hold sector, where consumer spending and 
housing demand now appear to be on lower trajectories than we had previously projected, 
and where consumer confidence has turned dow n recently.  But conditions in the business
sector seem to have softened as well:  Although business investment in equipment and 
software posted another robust increase last  quarter, private empl oyment gains have 
moderated in recent months, factory output falt ered at the end of the second quarter, and 
many forward-looking indicators for business investment and production have moved 
down.  Overall, we have marked down our for ecast for real GDP growth in the second 
half to an average annual ra te of 2½ percent, ½ percentage  point less than in the June 
Tealbook.  
 
Despite the softer tone of the incoming da ta, we continue to think that conditions 
are in place for a moderate recovery over the medium term.  Indeed, if anything, financial 
conditions appear slightly more supportive of ec onomic growth than in June, with interest
rates and the exchange value of the dollar lo wer, and household net wo rth slightly higher, 
than at the time of the last Tealbook.  All told, we expect real GDP to step up to a 
3.6 percent rate of growth in 2011, as the boost from accommodative monetary policy,  
a gradual easing in credit constraints, and eventual improvements in household and 
business confidence more than outweighs the waning effects on activity from fiscal 
stimulus.  Given the weaker near-term trajectory in this forecast, the unemployment rate is now projected to remain at about its s econd-quarter average of 9¾ percent through the 
end of this year before declining to a lit tle under 9 percent at  the end of 2011, about 
¼ percentage point higher th an in the June Tealbook.   
1 The annual revision to the national income and product accounts (NIPA) included a sizable 
downward adjustment to real GDP from 2007 to 2009. As a result, the recession now looks deeper than 
previously estimated, and the level of real GDP at the end of 2009 is now reported to be 1 percent lower. 
Additional details on the revisions are included in the appendix at the end of this section.

Recent readings on consumer price inflation have come in a little to the high side 
of our expectations, which—combined with the higher path for oil prices and the 
modestly weaker dollar—led us to make a sm all upward adjustment to our projection for 
consumer price inflation.  That said, the basi c contour of our price forecast is essentially 
unchanged:  The anticipated downward pressu re on inflation create d by the large amount 
of economic slack is projected to be temper ed significantly by well-anchored inflation 
expectations.  Thus, we now project that core PCE prices will rise a little more than 
1 percent this year and a little  less than 1 percent next year , compared with our previous 
projection for increases of ¾ percent in both ye ars.  Oil prices have begun to move back 
up, and with moderate increas es projected for energy pri ces in coming quarters, we 
expect overall inflation to run slightly above  core inflation over the forecast period. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
We continue to assume that the FOMC w ill hold the target federal funds rate in 
the current range of 0 to ¼ pe rcent through the end of next y ear.  The liftoff from this 
range is assumed to occur in the fall of 2012, one quarter later than in the June Tealbook.  
We have made no substantial changes to  our assumptions for nontraditional policy 
actions.  We continue to assume that the Federal Reserve will begin selling agency debt 
and MBS at a gradual pace in the first part of 2013 after having a llowed these securities 
to run off passively until then.  Nevertheless,  we now project that the System’s holdings 
of agency MBS will be about  $120 billion less at the end of 2011 than assumed in the 
June Tealbook, because the lower level of mort gage rates in this projection accelerates 
the pace of prepayments.   
Financial Conditions  
The 10-year Treasury yield has declined about 40 basis points since the time of 
the June Tealbook, reflecting economic data that  were weaker than market participants 
had expected and FOMC communications that highlighted downside risks to the outlook.  Going forward, we anticipate that the 10-year  Treasury yield will increase about 80 basis 
points to a bit under 4 percen t by the end of 2011.  As in the previous forecast, the 
upward tilt reflects several factors, includi ng the gradual movement of the 10-year 
valuation window through the period of near-zero short-term rates, the expectation of 
further substantial debt is suance by the Treasury in coming years, and the upward

pressure on Treasury yields from the anticipat ed decrease in the System’s holdings of 
longer-term securities. 
Conforming fixed mortgage rates have d ecreased about in line with the 10-year 
Treasury yield and now stand at  about 4½ percent.  We have shifted down the projected 
path of mortgage rates in response, but we c ontinue to expect them to rise with Treasury 
yields, reaching about 5¼ percent by the end of 2011.  Yields on BBB-rated corporate 
bonds have fallen somewhat more than the 10- year Treasury yield a nd are ½ percentage 
point below the level we had assumed in the June Tealbook.  As in previous projections, 
we expect the BBB bond yield to move up through 2011, though by less than Treasury 
yields, as corporate bond sp reads are anticipated to na rrow somewhat further.   
The Dow Jones Total U.S. Stock Market Index is at about the level we had 
expected in the June Tealbook, and the path for stock prices through 2011 is essentially 
unchanged.  With the equity premium remaini ng well above longer-run norms, we project 
that stock prices will rise at an average annua l rate of 16 percent, as the implied equity 
premium moves toward a mo re typical level.   
Recent readings on house prices have been firmer than we had expected, and in 
response, we have removed most of the price de cline we had anticipated  for this year.  As 
a result, we now project house prices to be about unchange d, on net, over the projection 
period, leaving the price level at the end of 2011 nearly 3 pe rcent above that assumed in 
the June Tealbook. 
Fiscal Policy 
We made a few minor changes to our assumptions about fiscal policy.  As 
expected, the Congress extended emerge ncy unemployment compensation (EUC) 
benefits through November.  However, that  extension did not include a stimulus 
provision that had been adding an extra $25 per week to all une mployment insurance 
benefits; as a result, our proj ected path of transfer paymen ts is about $12 billion (annual 
rate) lower from the current quarter through the end of next year.  Reflecting recent 
congressional developments, we also dropped our assumption that an additional 
$25 billion of federal grants-in-aid would be provided to state and local governments.  
Because of these policy changes, we now exp ect that federal fiscal policy will provide a 
touch less impetus to aggregate demand than we had anticipated in our June forecast.  Our assumptions regarding other federal polic ies are the same as in June, including our 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
August 4, 2010
Page 4 of 108
assumption that many provisions of the 2001–03 tax cuts for high-income households 
will be allowed to expire at the end of this  year, and that the ma ximum duration of EUC 
benefits will be scaled back next year.  All to ld, we continue to expe ct that the support to 
economic activity from federal fiscal policy will wane over the projection period.  (See 
the box on fiscal policy fo r further discussion.)  
Our forecast calls for a unified federal budge t deficit that is a touch narrow er than 
in the June Tealbook.  This revi sion reflects both the lower outlays consistent with our 
revised policy assumptions and higher-than-expected corporate tax payments in recent 
months that are expected to pe rsist.  Nevertheless, the federal deficit is anticipated to  
remain at about $1.3 trillion in both fiscal year 2010 (around 9 percent of GDP) and fiscal 
2011 (at 8½ percent of GDP).  We expect no si gnificant improvement in the deficit next 
year because the projected boost to receipts from the continuing economic recovery and 
the winding down of some stimulus-related sp ending are mostly offset by anticipated 
increases in other outlays.  
The Foreign Outlook and the Dollar 
We project that foreign GDP  growth will step down from an annual rate of 
4¾ percent in the first half of  this year to roughly 3¼ per cent over the rema inder of this 
year and in 2011, as the recovery matures and policy stimulus is gradually removed.  In 
Europe, indicators have shown su rprising resilience and the resu lts of the bank stress tests 
have helped allay investor c oncerns, leading us to mark up the near-term outlook there a 
bit.  However, we continue to project that fiscal consolidation in a number of European 
economies and financial uncertainties, partic ularly in the more vulnerable of these 
economies, will weigh on growth in the region over the forecast period.  Meanwhile, in China, GDP growth in the second quarter slowed somewhat more than we had anticipated, as the tightening measures put in  place by the authorities seem to be taking 
hold a bit more quickly, and we have carried th is more moderate trajectory into our near-
term forecast.  With the slightly greater near-term momentum in Europe balancing the 
slightly softer near-term outlook for China, our forecast for overall foreign growth is 
roughly unchanged from that in the June Tealbook. 
Since the June forecast, the dollar ha s declined about 3 percent on a trade-
weighted basis against a broad set of curre ncies.  This decline reflected better-than-
expected foreign economic data, particularly  in Europe, as well as some weaker-than-
expected U.S. economic data, and was reinforced by some reversal of flight-to-safety

The Effects of Fiscal Policy on the Economy  
Fiscal policy  has provided significant support to   economic activity  during the past two years, 
reflecting both discretionary fiscal policy actions, 
such as the American Recovery and 
 Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), and the influence of automatic stabilizers—the changes in  
 government revenues and outlays that occur endogenously  over the business cycle.  During  
the remainder of the projection period, however, we estimate that the support  from both types of 
fiscal policies—summed across all levels of government—will wane.  Although we are  
comfortable with the broad contour of the macroeconomic effects implied by our analysis, 
considerable uncertainty surrounds the precise 
magnitude and timing of the support to economic 
activity from fiscal policy.  
Our analysis starts with  the staff’s measure of 
fiscal impetus (FI), which is an estimate of the  
direct effects of discretionary fiscal policy actions on aggregate demand.  Changes in  aggregate 
demand captured by FI re flect the increase in 
purchases of goods and services by  governments 
as well as the direct changes in demand from  
households and firms resulting from policy  
initiatives affecting taxes and transfer payments. 
In the case of taxes and transfers, FI’s estimates 
of consumer spending e ffects are derived from  
econometric evidence suggesting that household
 spending resp onds less, and more gradually, to 
tax changes than to changes in transfers.  With 
regard to the temporary boost to grants-in-aid to   
state and local governments from the ARRA, ourestimates of impetus assume—based  on survey 
evidence—that these governments have been phasing in their response over time in order to 
avoid a sharp drop-off in outlays  when  those 
grants end.  Importantly, in the case of the ARRA, the lagged spending effects assumed by  
the staff are more drawn out than those apparently assumed in the analysis of some other 
public and private forecasters.    
The table below shows th e staff’s estimates of 
the effect of FI on the change in real GDP from  
2008 through 2011, m  easured on a Q4-over-Q4 
basis.  Federal FI includes not only the effects of 
the ARRA, but also the effects of other policy 
changes such  as the stimulus package enacted in  
2008, extensions of emergency unemployment compensation, and ongoing increases in real 
federal purchases of goods and services.  Federal 
FI also includes the effects of changes in state  
and local purchases prompted by changes in  
federal grants-in-aid.  All told, we estimate that  
federal FI (line 2) boosted the rate of change in  
real GDP about 1¼ percen tage points last year 
and will provide a lift to GDP growth of about 
½ percentage  point this year; we expect federal  
FI to exert  a drag of about ½ percentage point on

real GDP growth next y ear as stimulus policies 
wind down.  State and local FI (line 3) shows the
restraint on aggregate demand imposed by the 
policy reactions of these governments to the tigh
budget conditions  they face;  to avoid double 
counting, state and local FI does not include the effects of federal grants-in-aid.  We estimate that
changes in state and local fiscal policies reduced 
the rate of change in real GDP ½ percentage poi
last year, and they are expected to  lower GDP 
growth by ¼ percentage point this year.  However, these effects  are anticipated to boost  
real GDP growth ½ percenta ge  point next year as
the economy continues to recover and state and 
local budget conditions improve.

The 
direct impetus to aggregate demand 
measured by  FI is augmented by follow-on 
effects as spending re sponds further to the 
endogenous changes in income, wealth, and other
factors.  The lower-left figure shows our 
estimates of total government FI (the black line) 
and total FI including follow-on effects (the red 
line), with the follow-on effects estimated using 
the staff’s FRB/US mode l.  After including 
follow-on effects, all discretionary fiscal policy  acti ons are estimated to  have increased  the rate  
of change in real GDP about 1 percentage point 
last year and will add about ½ percentage point  
this year and ¼ percentage  point next year. 
Automatic stabilizers—the decrease in  taxes and  
increase in  transfer payments that  occur 
endogenously in a  recession at all levels of  
government—have also supported economic activity.   As  shown by  the blue portion of the 
bars in the lower-right figure, automatic stabilizers (including thei r follow-on effects) are 
estimated to have added ¾ percentage point to the rate of change in real GDP in 2009 and will  
add about ½ percentage point to real GDP growth both this year and next year.  
The lower-right figure shows the combined effects of the automatic stabilizers and 
discretionary policy  actions at all levels of  
government (including follow-on effects).   
Overall fiscal  policy boosted the rate of change 
in real GDP about 1½ percentage points in 2009  
and will add roughly 1 percentage point  this year 
and ¾ percentage  point next year.

flows as financial system strains in Eur ope diminished.  Although the release of the 
European stress tests and several oversubscr ibed European sovereign debt auctions 
appear to have had a positive effect on investor  sentiment, we continue to expect that 
financial conditions will remain unsettled thr ough the end of this year and that the dollar 
will remain near current levels over this period.  In 2011, as European officials make 
further headway in addressing fiscal problems and as banking sector uncertainties recede, 
the broad real dollar is projec ted to depreciate again, at around a 3½ percent pace, leaving 
the path for the dollar somewhat lower than in the June forecast.  However, slowing 
growth in China and the tepid pace of renm inbi appreciation sin ce the announcement that 
the currency would be more flexible led us to scale back our assumption as to how much 
the renminbi will be allowed to appreciate against the dollar.  
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
Oil prices have moved up since the time of  the June Tealbook.  The spot price of 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil settled on August 3 at $82.55 per barrel, nearly $7.50 
higher than at the time of th e June forecast, boosted in part by improving economic news 
from Europe and the lower dollar.  Prices of  futures contracts dated for delivery through 
the end of 2011 have moved up by less than the s pot price.  Consistent with these futures 
prices, we now project that the spot price of WTI will rise to  more than $87 per barrel by 
the end of 2011, nearly $5 higher than in our prev ious forecast.  In contrast, the far-dated 
futures price for delivery in 2018 is only sligh tly higher than in the June forecast, settling 
at about $96 per barrel as of August 3. 
Prices for metals have risen briskly in recent weeks, although these gains have not 
fully retraced the price declines in April and May that occurred amid growing market 
concerns about economic prospects in Eur ope and reduced demand from China.  Food 
prices, which did not decline much in Apr il and May, also have moved higher in recent 
weeks, with concerns about droughts overseas  boosting wheat pri ces about 40 percent 
since the time of the June Tealbook.  We estim ate that given these higher food prices, our 
index of nonfuel commodity pri ces will increase in  the third quarter, an upward revision 
since the previous Tealbook.  Thereafter, consis tent with quotes from futures markets, we 
project nonfuel commodity prices  to edge up only slightly. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
Economic activity appears to be on a somewh at weaker upward trajectory than we 
were projecting in June.  We estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of about

2.1 percent in the second qua rter—¼ percentage point less than the BEA reported last 
week—after having increased 3.7 percent in th e first quarter.  Bu sinesses continued to 
rebuild inventories during the spring, and investment in eq uipment and software jumped 
for a third consecutive quarter.  However,  consumer spending rose only modestly, and, 
apart from a transitory boost to activity associated with the expiration of the homebuyer 
tax credit, housing construction continued to  be lackluster.  Moreover, imported goods 
apparently accounted for a sizable share of the increases in both household and business 
purchases, and despite another strong increase  in exports, net exports subtracted nearly 
3 percentage points from the change in real  GDP last quarter.  Given the more downbeat 
tone of the recent spending and production da ta and an apparent increase in concerns 
among businesses and households about the sustai nability of the recovery, we now expect 
real GDP growth to continue at a 2½ percen t pace over the second half of this year and 
the unemployment rate to remain at the s econd-quarter average of 9¾ percent through 
year-end.  In this economic environment, in flation is projected to remain low.   
Labor Markets 
The labor market continued to improve in the second quarter, albeit at a more 
subdued pace than expected in the June forecas t.  After increasing at an average monthly 
pace of 100,000 jobs over the first five months  of the year, private employment rose 
80,000 in June, about half as large a gain as we were anticipating.2  The average number 
of hours worked per week also came in below expectations in June , although it had ticked 
up in the second quarter overall. 
Most other labor market indicators also point to a more gradual improvement in 
the labor market than we we re projecting in June.  Init ial claims  for unemployment 
insurance have remained high in recent w eeks, indicators of job vacancies and hiring 
remain quite low, and household expectations about future labor market conditions have 
softened since the June Tealbook.  Consequent ly, we now expect private payrolls to 
increase at an average pace of about 125,000 per month in the third quarter, roughly 
75,000 less than in our June projection. 
The net gains in employment have not been enough to appreciably lower the 
unemployment rate.  Although the unemployment rate edged down in June, we view that 
2 Nonfarm payroll employment fell 125,000 in June, but this decline included the end of 225,000 
temporary census jobs.  We expect the winding down of the decennial census to subtract about 125,000 
workers from government payrolls in July; the rema ining 200,000 workers will fall off the Census payroll 
by the end of September.

decline as transitory and expect that it will  move back up to 9¾ percent in the third 
quarter, the same as its s econd-quarter average.   
The Industrial Sector 
Industrial production (IP) rose an annual rate of 6½ percen t in the second quarter 
as a whole, its fourth consecutive quarter of sizable gains.  But production ended the 
quarter on a weak note as manu facturing output fell ½ percen t in June.  Although we had 
anticipated a deceleration in manufacturing IP as the impetus to production from  
inventory rebuilding diminish ed, most recent indicators of near-term manufacturing 
activity have been softer than expected.  Two exceptions are the motor vehicle sector, 
where automakers have stepped up production in  the third quarter to replenish depleted 
dealer stocks, and the high-tech sector, wher e global demand appears solid.  All told, we 
now project that manufacturing output will increa se at an annual rate of just 2½ percent 
in the second half of this year, roughly 3½ percentage points less than in the June 
Tealbook.     
Household Spending 
Real consumer spending increased at an annual rate of 1½ pe rcent in the second 
quarter after increasing 2 percent in the firs t quarter, figures that  were considerably 
weaker than expected in the June Tealbook.  These tepid gains in consumer spending, 
coupled with the downward adjustments in the NIPA revisions to consumer spending 
during the 2007–09 period, led to a marked upward revision to the level of the personal 
saving rate in recent quarters;  as a result, the saving rate  stood at 6¼ percent in the 
second quarter of this year, about 2¼ percentage points higher than in th e June Tealbook.     
The latest readings on the determinants of consumption sugg est that gains in 
consumer spending over the second half of the year are likely to remain quite modest.  
Real disposable income, which rose at an annua l rate of 2¾ percent in the first six months 
of the year, is projected to increase only 1¼ percent at an annual ra te in the second half, 
reflecting the soft near-term outlook for em ployment and hours.  In addition, recent 
readings on consumer sentiment have fallen b ack, as households appear to have become 
more pessimistic about their personal fina ncial situations and the outlook for the 
economy.  At the same time, however, household credit conditions have improved 
somewhat.  On balance, we now expect real PC E to increase at an annual rate of just 1¾ 
percent over the second half of this year, rough ly the same pace as in the first half and 
about ½ percentage point less than in the June Tealbook.

Housing demand entered the third quarte r on a weaker footing than we had 
anticipated in the June Tealbook.  Home sales fell sharply, on average, in May and June 
following a surge in purchases ove r the preceding two months th at had been fueled by the 
expiring homebuyer tax credit.  These post-tax-credit sales readings we re softer than we 
had expected and suggest both that the payb ack of sales pulled forward by the homebuyer 
tax credit has been faster than we had antic ipated and that underly ing demand is weaker 
than we had expected.  As for construction activity, single-family starts moved sideways 
in June following May’s sharp decline, and the June permits data point to little 
improvement in July.  Going forward, low mo rtgage rates and improved affordability are 
still anticipated to provide some impetus to housing starts and residential investment over 
the second half of the year, but the incoming data have led us to mark down the pace of  
improvement relative to that  in the June forecast.   
Business Investment 
Real investment in equipment and software  (E&S) rose at an annual rate of more 
than 20 percent over the first ha lf of this year, as businesse s apparently resumed spending 
that had been deferred during the recession.3  We believe a portion of these outsized gains 
reflects a one-time step-up in the level of business outlays to bri ng capital spending back 
up to the level of replacement investment.  L ooking ahead, we expect that gains in capital 
spending in the second half of this year will step down considerably, to an annual rate of 
about 7¼ percent, as business output expands at a moderate pace.  The recent indicators 
for business spending appear consistent with th is deceleration.  For example, the rate of 
increase for new orders of nondefense capital goods (excluding aircraft) was significantly 
lower in the three months ending in June compared with the three-month period that 
ended in March.  And surveys of business conditions and sentiment, while still in positive 
territory, moved down, on balance, in June  and July, likely reflecting heightened 
concerns about sales prospects.  
Business outlays on nonresidential structur es (NRS) turned up in the second 
quarter, after several quarter s of steep declines.  Howe ver, the drilling and mining 
component of NRS, where activity has been  boosted by relatively high energy prices, 
more than accounted for the increase.  Meanwhile, outlays for other types of 
nonresidential constructi on projects have continued to cont ract, albeit at a much slower 
3 We estimate that during the rece ssion equipment and software spending fell below the levels required 
to keep pace with the aging of existing capital, which resulted in an outright contraction in our estimates of 
the stock of equipment and software capital.

pace than in preceding quarters.  Forward-looking indicators for this category, such as the 
diffusion index for architectural  billings, point to a furthe r moderation in the rate of 
decline.  That said, an overhang of unoccupied space and tight lending conditions 
continue to weigh on constructi on in this sector.  In all, our projection calls for small 
declines in building constructi on over the second half of this  year.  Meanwhile, projected 
energy prices remain high enough to sustain so lid increases in spe nding on drilling and 
mining structures over the second half of th is year despite the federal government’s 
temporary moratorium on deepwater drilling. 
Real inventory investment rose modestly in the first quarter, and the available 
data suggest that stocks moved up at a som
ewhat more rapid pace in the second quarter.  
Despite the recent restocking, which contributed  importantly to the increase in real GDP 
in the first half of this year, inventory- sales ratios are not po inting to any sizable 
overhangs.  Moreover, survey data indicat e that very few manuf acturers view their 
customers’ inventories as “too high.”  In the motor vehicle sector, days’ supply of light 
vehicles in June remained quite lean by hist orical standards.  With vehicle assemblies 
anticipated to rise sharply th is quarter and sales expected to remain near their second-
quarter pace, we look for dealer inventorie s to move up further through the summer.  
Elsewhere, we expect inventory rebuilding to continue at a m oderate rate in the third and 
fourth quarters, as firms raise production in orde r to keep inventories in line with rising 
sales.  On average, inventory investment is projected to be a relatively neutral influence 
on real GDP growth over the second half of this year.  
Government 
After only edging up over the previous tw o quarters, real federal purchases 
increased at an annual rate of 9¼ percent in  the second quarter as  a result of brisk 
increases in defense outlays and temporary hiring associated with the decennial census.  
We expect real federal purchases to rise at an  annual rate of 2½ per cent in the second half 
of this year, as defense spending rises at a more subdued pace and the winding down of 
temporary census operations keeps overal l nondefense purchases roughly flat.   
Real outlays by state and local governments  moved up a bit in the second quarter, 
following declines in the previous three qua rters.  Employment at state and local 
governments continued to decrease in the s econd quarter, but the job losses were about 
half the first-quarter pace.  In contrast, fo llowing sharp drop-offs in the previous two 
quarters, state and local investment sp ending—primarily for construction projects—

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Page 15 of 108
jumped at an annual rate of more than 10 per cent last quarter.  Reflecting the still-strained 
budgets of many jurisdictions, ov erall state and local spending  is projected to be about 
flat in the second half of th e year, as modest increases in  construction spending roughly 
offset continued weakness in state and local hiring.   
Foreign Trade  
Real imports accelerated dramatically in the second quarter, expanding at an 
annual rate of 29 percent, as they continued to recover follo wing steep declines in late 
2008 and early 2009.  The surge was broad based across product categories, with 
particular strength in capital goods, auto motive products, and consumer goods; the 
second-quarter increase brings each of these groups most of the way back to their 2008 
peaks.  Growth in real imports was considerab ly larger than we had estimated in June.  
Real export growth, which came in at 10 percen t in the second quarter, was also higher 
but by a much smaller amount.  As a result, real  net exports are now estimated to subtract 
2¾ percentage points from the annual rate of  change in GDP in the second quarter, 
2½ percentage points more th an in the June forecast.  
In the second half of 2010, net exports are expected to add nearly ½ percentage 
point (annual rate) to the increa se in real GDP, compared with  the negligible contribution 
we wrote down in June.  Real exports should increase at an annual ra te of 10 percent in 
the second half of 2010, a little fa ster than in the previous forecast, in line with the 
weaker path for the dollar.  We project re al imports to decelerate sharply after the 
extremely brisk second quarter but to a still-solid 5 percent annual rate. 
Prices and Wages 
Since the June Tealbook, the change in PCE prices excluding food and energy has 
been revised up ¼ percentage point in 2009 and nearly ½ percentage po int, on average, in 
the first half of this year, reflecting the BEA’s annual revision and higher-than-expected 
readings on the core CPI in May and June.4  With these revisions, core PCE prices 
increased at an annual rate of  about 1¼ percent in both the first and second quarters of 
this year, after rising 1¾ percen t over 2009.  The index for prices of core goods fell in the 
first half, following increases last year, and we expect that it will post further declines in 
the second half of this year.  The price inde x for non-energy services rose at about the 
4 The upward revision to core PCE inflation in 2009 primarily reflected higher estimates of nonmarket 
prices.  The upward revision to the first quarter also reflected, in part, higher nonmarket prices, as well as 
the BEA’s correction of what we had viewed as anomalously low readings for one particular durable goods 
category (luggage).  Thus, we do not attach much signal to the historical revisions.

same modest pace in the first ha lf of this year as in 2009.  However, the smooth pattern of 
increases in core services prices masks di vergent movements in key components, as an 
acceleration in prices of nonmarket services—to which we do not attach much signal of 
underlying inflation—offset a deceleration in the prices of market-based services.  As a 
result, we expect services pri ce inflation to move down a bit in  the second half as the rate 
of change in nonmarket prices sl ows.  In all, we project core  prices to rise at an annual 
rate of just under 1 percent in  the second half of the year.  
After increasing at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the first quarter, the index 
for total PC
E prices was roughly unchanged in the second quarter as consumer energy 
prices reversed their run-up earli er this year.  More recently, oil prices have begun to turn 
up again, and we expect consumer energy prices to pick up over the second half of this 
year.  Reflecting this increase in energy prices , total PCE inflation is projected to step up 
to nearly 1½ percent in the second half, about ½ percentage point above core inflation.   
The incoming data on labor compensation continue to be weak.  Based on the 
BEA’s revised estimates of private compen sation, we now estimate that compensation  
per hour was roughly unchanged in the first half  of this year after having risen at an 
upwardly revised rate of  2½ percent, on average, in 2008 and 2009.  Furthermore, 
weaker-than-expected earnings data in May and June suggest that compensation is on a 
lower trajectory going into the second half of this year than we had projected previously.  
The ECI measure of hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the 
second quarter, somewhat less than the 2½ percent increase in the fi rst quarter that had 
been boosted by outsized increases in h ealth insurance cost s and in employer 
contributions to retirement and savings plans.   Both measures of hourly compensation are 
projected to rise at an annual ra te of just under 2 percent in the second half of the year.     
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
The transition from a recovery supported  by inventory rebuilding to one led by a 
strengthening in final sales seems to be evol ving more slowly than we had projected in 
previous forecasts.  However, in an e nvironment of accommodative monetary policy, 
more supportive financial conditions, and increas ing credit availabil ity, households and 
businesses are anticipated to become more c onfident.  Taken together, these factors are 
expected to contribute to an increasing willingn ess to spend and invest.  As a result, we 
expect real GDP growth to pi ck up from an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second half 
of this year to 3.6 percent in 2011.  Of course , the gains we are projecting for next year

are still relatively tepid for an economic recovery, and consequently, the unemployment 
rate declines only gr adually—ending 2011 at nearly 9 percent.   
An important issue for our forecast is the medium-term implications of the revised 
data on consum
er spending that show a larger contraction in real PCE during the 
recession and a smaller rebound through the spring.  On the one hand, the larger 
“shortfall” in consumer spending suggested  by the revised data could mean that 
households are well positioned to quickly step up the pace of spending and to pare 
saving, once hiring picks up more substant ially and confidence about the economic 
outlook increases.  On the other hand, the shortfall in PCE might reflect an ongoing 
transition to a higher saving ra te that continues through 2011, as  households further repair 
their balance sheets and rely less on credit.  Our forecast takes a middle ground, in that 
the personal saving rate is proj ected to be about flat at 6¼ pe rcent through the end of next 
year.  Nonetheless, with real disposable inco me expected to accelerate, our forecast calls 
for the growth rate of real PCE to increas e from an annual rate of 1¾ percent over the 
second half of this year  to 3½ percent in 2011.   
The basic story for the housing sector is much the same as in recent projections.  
We expect that housing demand will firm  over the medium term, aided by the boost to 
affordability from low mortgage rates and lo w house prices, increasing confidence that 
house prices have bottomed out, and impr ovements in income and employment.  
However, we continue to expect that the difficulties in obtaining credit that many 
potential homebuyers and builders are facing will recede only gradually and that 
competition from the still-large overhang of existing homes will hamper the pace of  
recovery in new home sales and construction.  Our forecast calls for single-family starts 
to move up from their recent annual rate of about 500,000 units to about 830,000 units by 
the end of next year—a bit weaker than th e June Tealbook projecti on and a level still far 
below our judgment of the pace consistent with the longer-run demand for housing.  (See 
the box on the long-run prospects for housing construction for more information.)   
The outlook for business investment next year  is little changed in this projection.  
We expect business purchases of equipmen t and software to expand about 11¾ percent 
next year as the low cost of capital, risi ng sales, and improving business sentiment lead 
businesses to continue to replace aging capital and, in some sectors, to expand capacity.  By contrast, investment in structures is projected to e dge down further next year.

The Long-Run Prospects for Housing Construction 
Estimates of the number of new housing units 
needed to keep pace w ith demographic trends, 
demolitions, and secondary housing offer a rough  
gauge of the trend  in  construction activity over 
the long run.  Although these estimates are quite sensitive to assumptions, they provide a 
guidepost for where construction starts may settle  
when housing and  mortgage markets recover and 
vacant units recede to normal levels.  
The main source of trend construction demand is net household formation.  The black line in the  
lower left figure shows annual growth rates in the number of households, a volatile series that tends 
to fall noticeably around recessions.  Cutting 
through this volatility, the growth rate in  the adult 
population—the red line—can be regarded as a rough proxy for the underlying rate of household 
formation.  Looking forward, the Census Bureau fgvb   
projects that the growth  rate of  the adult  
population will average just below 1 percent over the next five years; we estimate that this  
projection implies an underlying household formation rate of about 1.1  million units per year 
over this period.  
In addition to household formation, housing units 
will be needed to replace demolished units and  for nonprimary residences (including second and seasonal houses).  Working from estimates of  
the demolition rate, we think that nearly  300,000  
units per year will need to  be replaced.  Demand 
for new nonprimary residences is more difficult to assess, but fitted time trends for the number of 
units per household, along with the projected 
trend in household formation, imply that 
350,000 units  per year will need  to be built.  
Taken together, demand from these three sources totals 1¾ million units.  
The figure in the lower right compares historical  
and projected total housing starts (the black line) 
with  trend construction demand (the red line).  
Starts have broadly tracked this benchmark over history, though substantial  misalignments have 
persisted for some periods.   For example, starts 
generally ran above trend demand from 1995 to  
2005.  In contrast, starts have dropped far below  
trend demand  since 2006—the  biggest  
discrepancy over the period shown.  We expect 
only a small portion of this gap to close over the 
medium term, as the transition toward  
benchmark levels is restrained by the overhang  
of vacant houses and by credit conditions that 
ease only gradually.

lending conditions for commercial real estate, suggest that, while spending may be 
stabilizing, a substantial recovery in this sector remains years away. 
The rise in real federal expenditures is anticipated to  slow to 1 percent in 2011, 
following a 4 percen
t increase this year.  Real  defense spending is expected to be about 
flat next year, after increa sing nearly 4 percent in 2010, while nondefense purchases are 
projected to continue to rise at a modera te pace.  Meanwhile, real state and local 
purchases are expected to be little changed in 2011; this forecast is a bit weaker than in 
our previous projection because we now assume that these governments will not be 
receiving additional stimulus grants-in-aid.  Although state and local revenues are expected to rise next year as the economy  recovers, the tapering off of federal stimulus 
grants is anticipated to ke ep state and local budgets tight  and to restrain spending.  
In 2011, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth is expected to be roughly 
neutral, as imports rise slight ly less than exports but from a higher base.  We estimate that 
real exports will increase 8 percent in 2011, supported by strong foreign economic 
growth and a declining dollar.   Real imports are projecte d to move up 6½ percent in 
2011, in line with U.S. GDP growth.  Relative to the previous forecast, the weaker dollar led us to revise export growth up about ¾ pe rcentage point and revise import growth 
down ½ percentage point. 
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION   
Potential GDP and the NAIRU 
As a result of the BEA’s downward revisi ons to actual GDP in recent years, we 
made a modest downward adjustment to our es timate of the level of potential GDP in this 
projection.  We calibrated this adjustment to roughly elimin ate the tension between our 
estimates of the output gap and the unempl oyment rate gap—the residual in “Okun’s 
Law”—in the first half of 2010, and implemente d it by slightly reducing the growth rates 
of potential in 2008 and 2009.  However, we did not materially change our assumption 
about the growth rate of potential GDP going forward, and thus we continue to assume  
that potential GDP will increase at an annual rate of about 2½ percent over the forecast 
period.    
As in recent forecasts, we continue to believe that a portion of last year’s sharp 
rise in actual labor productivity showed th rough to structural mu ltifactor productivity on 
the interpretation that some of the increase re flected one-time efficiency gains that firms

were able to achieve in a very difficult business environment.  However, we do not 
believe that these gains are likely to be repeated going forward, and so we project that structural multifactor productivity growth will drop back toward a more sustainable pace 
over the forecast period.  In terms of structural  labor productivity, part  of that slowing is 
offset by a larger assumed contribution from  capital deepening this year and next as a 
result of the recent and projected re covery in business investment.   
In addition, our assumption that the NAI RU will rem
 ain at  5¼ percent through 
2011, rather than rising as we believe o ccurred during 2009, eliminates a drag on 
potential output growth.5  This assumption, in conjunc tion with anticip ated population 
growth and a small downward tre nd in labor force pa rticipation associated with the aging 
of the workforce, leads us to project increas es in trend hours of ¾ percent this year and 
next, about ¼ percentage point more than in 2009.  
Productivity and the Labor Market 
We continue to view some of last year’s outsized rise in labor productivity as 
reflecting transitory developments that m oved the level of productivity well above its 
structural level.  For example, anecdotal reports suggest that firms squeezed significant 
efficiency gains from their workforces in 2009; in addition, the likely tendency for firms 
to lay off their less productive workers during the period of rapid job loss probably raised the average level of productivity of the ex isting workforce.  However, we do not see 
these productivity gains as sust ainable, and, indeed, we estimate that productivity growth 
has already slowed to an a nnual rate of about 1½ percent over the first half of 2010 as 
employment and hours worked turned up.  Goi ng forward, we think that achieving further 
output gains will continue to require firm s to ramp up hours worked, and that labor 
demand will also be supported by firms’ increased confidence in the recovery.  Accordingly, we anticipate that labor productiv ity will rise at an av erage annual rate of 
about 1¼ percent over the forecast period, wh ich would gradually move the level of 
actual productivity back to its structural level.  
5 The 5¼ percent figure for the NAIRU does not include the effects of extended and emergency 
unemployment benefits (EEB).  EEB programs add to the unemployment rate by inducing individuals who 
would otherwise have dropped out of the labor force to report themselves as unemployed in order to receive these benefits, and by enabling jobseekers to be more deliberate in their search.  We estimate that these 
programs are currently boosting the unemployment rate by close to 1 percentage point, and we anticipate that this effect will only diminish a bit through next year.  As a re sult, the amount of unemployment not 
representative of slack in resource utilization—which could be thought of as an “effective” NAIRU—is currently around 6¼ percent and will edge down to about 5¾ percent by the end of next year.

Increases in private payroll employment are projected to  step up from an average 
pace of about 150,000 per month over the rema inder of this year to roughly 250,000 per 
month in 2011.  The still-modest pace of job growth  for the rest of this year results in an 
unemployment rate that remain s essentially unchanged, at around 9¾ percent.  But as job 
gains accelerate, the jobless rate is gradua lly reduced to a bit unde r 9 percent by the end 
of next year, about ¼ percentage point hi gher than in the June Tealbook projection.   
Resource Utilization 
The unemployment rate that we project for the end of 2011 remains more than 
3 percentage points above the level consistent with our measure of the effective NAIRU, 
as adjusted for the estimated influence of extended and emergency unemployment benefits (EEB).  This wide margin of slack is expected to be accompanied by a number of 
other conditions consistent with a labor market that re mains weak, including a below-
trend level of labor force participatio n and, in all likelihood, an unusually large 
concentration of workers experiencing unemployment spells of long duration.  
Our projection for the GDP gap also i ndicates that, even as the amount of 
underutilized resources in the economy di minishes over the projection period, slack 
remains substantial.  As mentioned earlier, we allowed some of the downward historical 
revision to GDP to show through to the GDP  gap, which reduced the tension that had 
arisen between it and the unemployment rate gap.  In addition, given the downward 
revision to real GDP growth over the projec tion period, we now project the GDP gap to 
close by somewhat less than in the June T ealbook.  As a result, th e GDP gap now shrinks 
from nearly 8 percent at the end of 2009 (¾ percentage point wider than in the June 
projection) to 6½ percent at the end of 2011 (more than 1 percentage point wider).   
We continue to expect slack in the indus trial sector to be taken up more quickly 
than in the economy as a whole, in part because manufacturing capacity  is projected to be 
flat, on average, in 2010 and 2011 after cont racting 1¼ percent in 2009.  Nevertheless, 
the factory operating rate at the end of the projection period is appreciably below its long-
run average.  
Compensation and Prices 
The wide margin of slack in the labor ma rket and low rates of price inflation are 
expected to continue to restrain labor cost s over the forecast period.  The productivity and 
cost measure of compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector is projected to rise

2 percent in the second half of  this year and 2¼ percent next year, both a bit slower than 
in the June projection.  Similarly, we expect the employment cost index to rise at an 
annual rate of about 2 percent over the for ecast period.  These modest gains in hourly 
compensation, in conjunction with the moderate projected rise in labor productivity, 
imply increases in unit labor costs of less than 1 percent, on av erage, in the second half of 
this year and in 2011.   
The lower path of the dollar in this pr ojection, together wi th the small upward 
revision to the path for non-oil commodity pr ices, has led us to ra ise our projection f
or 
core goods import prices (that is , goods excluding fuels, computers, and semiconductors).  
We now expect core import pri ces to increase at an aver age annual rate of just over 
1¼ percent through the forecast period.  Thus, we expect that core import prices will 
exert a small amount of upward pressure on core PCE prices in the period ahead.  
The incoming data on consumer prices have surprised us a little  to the upside, and 
the paths of energy and import pr ices are a little higher.  Ho wever, with the margin of  
slack wider in this projection and inflati on expectations remaining well anchored, we 
have made only a small upward revision to our projection for core PCE inflation in the  
second half of this year and in 2011.  In all, we project that co re PCE prices will rise a bit 
more than 1 percent in 2010 and a bit less than 1 percent in 2011.  With energy prices 
expected to rise modestly, we project that  overall PCE inflation will run just a touch 
above core inflation in both 2010 and 2011.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2014 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assessments of long-run supply- side conditions, fisc al policy, and other factors.  The 
contour of the long-run outlook depe nds on the following key assumptions: 
  Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long run, 
consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections provided by FOMC participants at the June meeting. 
  Redemptions, prepayments, and sales of agency debt and MBS are assumed to 
significantly reduce holdings of longer-term securities in the Federal 
Reserve’s portfolio by the end of 2014.  Th is decrease in the Fed’s holdings is

assumed to contribute about 30 basis points to the rise in the 10-year Treasury 
yield from 2012 through 2014. 
  The risk prem iums on corporate bonds and equity decline gradually, and 
banks ease their lending standard s somewhat further beyond 2011.   
  Total discretionary fiscal policy actions ar e essentially a neutral factor for real 
GDP growth in 2012, as the continued wa ning of federal stimulus is roughly 
offset by ongoing improvements in state and local budget conditions.  Beyond 
2012, fiscal policy becomes mo re restrictive.  In particular, the federal 
government budget deficit narrows to  about 5 percent of GDP by 2014, 
reflecting not only the effects of ec onomic recovery on tax receipts and 
transfer payments, but also discretionary  actions aimed at restraining federal 
borrowing.  Beyond 2012, state and local policy actions are roughly neutral 
with both purchases and taxe s as share of GDP remaini ng essentially constant.  
  The foreign exchange value of the dolla r is assumed to depreciate 1½ percent 
in real terms in 2012 and 1¼ percent in both 2013 and 2014.  The price of  
WTI crude oil rises gradually to around $90 per barrel by the end of 2014, consistent with futures prices.  Unde r these assumptions, movements in the 
prices of energy and imports have on ly minor implications for domestic 
inflation in the extension.  Forei gn real GDP expands, on average, about 
3¼ percent per year from 2012 thr ough 2014, with foreign output gaps 
continuing to narrow. 
  With emergency and extended unemployment benefit programs assumed to 
wind down over 2012, the “effective” NAIRU  falls from 5¾ percent at the 
end of 2011 to 5¼ percent by the end of 2012, where it remains through 2014.  
Potential GDP is assumed to expand around 2½ percent per year, on average, 
from 2012 to 2014.  
The unemployment rate enters 2012 at a ve ry high level, and inflation is well 
below the assumed long-run target.  Under the assumptions used to construct the 
extension, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound until the fall of 
2012.  From that point on, the federal funds rate climbs steadily, reaching 2 percent by  
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Page 30 of 108
the end of 2013 and 3¼ percent in 2014.6  Real GDP rises at an annual rate of 4¾ percent 
on average over the 2012–14 period, well a bove its potential pace, as improved 
confidence, reduced uncertainty, and suppor tive financial conditions allow aggregate 
demand to catch up with aggregate supply.  The unemployment rate falls to the NAIRU 
by late 2014.  Core PCE inflation moves up modestly after 2011 as economic activity 
recovers and long-run inflation expectati ons are assumed to remain well anchored. 
6 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate (R) follows the prescriptions of a Taylor-type rule of 
the form R = 2.5 + π - 1.1(u-u*) + 0.5( π – 2), subject to the zero lower bound constraint.  In this 
expression, π denotes the four-quarter rate of core PCE inflation, u is the civilian unemployment rate, and 
u* is the staff estimate of the NAIRU (with an adju stment for the temporary effects on unemployment of 
the extended and emergency unemployment benefit programs).  In essence, this formula is just the 
traditional Taylor rule, rewritten in terms of the une mployment gap, with the coefficient on resource 
utilization appropriately rescaled.

Appendix 
Annual Revision of the National  Income and Product Accounts 
The annual revision of the national income  and product accounts (NIPA), released on 
July 30, affected data back to the beginning of 2007.  This year’s revision mainly reflected the 
incorporation by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of newly available and revised source 
data, including the Census Bureau’s annual su rveys and the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) 
tabulation of corporate tax returns.  The fou r-quarter change in real gross domestic product 
(GDP) was revised down 0.2 percentage point in 2007  and 0.9 percentage point in 2008.  In 2009, 
the four-quarter change in real GDP was revised up 0.1 percentage point.  
The revised data show a lower path fo r real GDP over the 2007–09 period.  The 
downward revision was centered in real personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which are now estimated to have risen 0.4 percentage point per year more slowly  on average.  The revisions 
to real GDP also included a sizable downward adju stment to nonresidential investment in 2008.   
In 2009, the large downward revision to  PCE was s lightly more than offset by a sizable upward 
revision to nonresidential investment (particularly inventory investment).     
Although both the peak (2007:Q4) and trough (2009:Q2) in real GDP during the recent 
recession remained the same, the contraction is  now estimated to have been deeper than 
previously reported, 4.1 percent compared with 3.7 percent.  Thus, the contraction is the largest 
on record since 1948, the earliest period for which quarterly  data are available. 
The revisions to the BEA’s price indexes were generally small.  The estimates of both 
total and core PCE inflation were essentially  unchanged in 2007 and 2008, but were revised up  
about ¼ percentage point in 2009.  Last year ’s revision mostly reflects updated estimates of 
nonmarket prices, although the BEA also introduced  into its estimation procedures a number of  
new producer price indexes for market services.   The increases in overall GDP prices are now 
estimated to have been smaller in both 2007 an d 2009 primarily because of downward revisions 
to the price index for private fixed investment; in 2007, a part of the revision reflects the BEA’s expanded use of the Federal Reserve Board’ s deflators for communications equipment. 
On the income side of the accounts, the level of real gross domestic income (GDI) was 
revised down, on net, a little less than real GDP .  Nevertheless, the decrease in GDI is still 
reported to have exceeded the decrease in GDP by  an average of 1.0 percentage point per year 
over the 2007–09 period.  Corporate profits were revised down in all three years.  The revised 
estimates now put the share of economic profits in GNP at the end of 2009 at 9.8 percent, 
0.3 percentage point lower than the previous estim ate.  By industry, the downward revisions were 
most heavily  concentrated in the domestic financia l sector.  Nonfinancial sector profits were also 
revised down in 2007 and 2009 but were revised up in 2008.

In contrast, real disposable personal inco me (DPI) is now estimated to have risen 
considerably  faster, on net, than previously  estimated.  Most of the components of personal 
income revised up, but the largest contributor to the overall revision to DPI was a higher estimate 
of personal dividend income (derived from IRS da ta).  The higher level of disposable income, 
together with the downward revisions to PCE,  resulted in a sizable upward revision to the 
personal saving rate. 
The annual NIPA revision also provided info rmation about the likely magnitude of 
upcoming revisions to measures of productivity an d compensation in the nonfarm business sector.  
We now estimate that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 2.7 percent over the four quarters of 2007, before declining 0.3 per cent in 2008, and then rising 6.3 percent in 2009; 
the estimate for 2008 is considerably weaker than reported earlier, while the productivity surge in 2009 is now even larger.  In addition, we now est imate that compensation per hour in the nonfarm  
business sector rose 3.6 percent over the four quarte rs of 2007 and about 2.5 percent in both 2008 
and 2009; the estimate for 2008 is somewhat weaker than reported earlier, while the increase in  
compensation per hour in 2009 is about 2.3 percentage points stronger.  The revisions to last year’s compensation figures stem primarily from  larger estimates of employer contributions to  
pension and insurance funds.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Economic indicators in Europe have been su rprisingly resilient, leading us to edge 
up our projection for the region’s growth.  In addition, the generally positive reception of 
the EU bank stress tests and the modest improvements in financial indicators for Europe 
have reduced our assessment of the downside risks to our forecast stemming from fiscal 
stresses in the region.  That said, we stil l expect European growth to face significant 
headwinds as fiscal policy star ts to consolidate, European banks continue to repair 
balance sheets, and the bounceback in globa l trade and manufacturing plays through (see 
the section “Developments in Global Trade”) .  Lessening policy support and a maturation 
of the recovery in trade are also expected to contribute to some  slowing in the emerging 
market economies.  Indeed, Chinese GDP for the second quarter was somewhat weaker 
than we had expected, which, along with a ma rkdown to growth in Latin America in the 
second half of the year, led us to fore cast a slightly more pronounced near-term  
moderation for emerging market economies than  we had projected in the June Tealbook.  
On balance, the contour of our projection for foreign activity is little changed from the 
June Tealbook.  We continue to see growth abroad stepping down from above 4½ percent 
in the first half of this year to a more  sustainable 3¼ to 3½ percent rate through the 
forecast period.

not read too much into this su rprise and continue to expect inflation to move up later this 
year and then stabilize at a subdued 2¼ percent pace.  
As mentioned above, policy support is expect ed to dim inish over the course of the 
forecast period.  Fiscal policy in the advanced economies is expected to turn from being 
roughly neutral for growth this year to ex erting a ¾ percentage point drag in 2011.  
Monetary policy abroad is expected to remain generally accommodative over the forecast 
period.  That said, a number of central ba nks, including those in Canada, Australia, 
Brazil, India, and Korea, have  already initiated policy tighten ing.  The effect of Chinese 
measures to rein in lending and moderate the pace of GDP growth has been manifest 
somewhat more quickly than expected, and we believe that the pace of tightening is 
likely to slow a bit going forward.   
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
We estimate that real GDP in the advan ced foreign economies (AFEs) grew at an 
annual rate of 3¼ percent in the second quart er, near the rapid first-quarter pace of 
3.6 percent and a little faster than we wrote down in June.  We project that growth will 
move down to below 2½ percent in the second half  of this year and remain at that pace in 
2011, as fiscal consolidation and the slow  revival of bank lending in a number of 
countries restrain growth and as the boost to  activity from the recovery in inventories 
wanes.

 Recent ind icators for the euro area have s hown little imprint of the fiscal stresses

external trade, grew at a rapid pace again in May, with par ticularly strong performance in 
Germany and France, and industr ial orders point to additiona l gains.  Notably, euro-area 
purchasing managers indexes turned up in Jul y, consistent with substantial momentum in 
manufacturing and services, and consumer and business sentiment bounced back.  
Moreover, sentiment may have received a furt her boost from the results of the bank stress 
tests, which seem to have helped reduce fears that sovereign debt pressures could lead to 
a widespread banking crisis (see the box “Summary of the EU-Wide Stress-Test 
Exercise”).   
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook  
   Given the significant financial disruptions  and uncertainty associated with the 
fiscal turmoil in the euro area over the past few months, the buoyancy of the incoming 
data has been surprising.  In response, we have revised up our estimate of second-quarter 
growth 1 percentage point to 2¾ percent.  But with substantia l fiscal consolidation in the 
pipeline, the impetus from the inventory cy cle fading, and financial institutions still 
facing funding pressures and, in some cases, ne eds for recapitalization, we continue to 
believe that significant headwinds and risks remain. Accord ingly, we expect euro-area 
growth to slow to an average pace of 1¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast 
period, only slightly stronger than in the previous Tealbook; the composition of growth is 
just a bit less dependent on net exports than in our June forecast, reflecting the recent 
appreciation of the euro. 
 In Japan, indicators of household spendi ng have remained weak through May, and 
consumer sentiment remains well below its pre- crisis peak.  Most of the solid 2¾ percent 
growth that we estimate for Japanese GDP in  the second quarter appears attributable to 
continued strong exports, which have been fl owing mostly to emerging Asia.  However, 
some signs of moderation are evident in that process—Japanese machinery orders 
declined sharply in May, and industrial production and real exports moved down in June—consistent with our expectations for somewhat slower GDP growth in the second 
half of this year and next. 
 In contrast, Canada’s recovery is bei ng driven by robust domestic demand.  We 
estimate that Canadian real GDP grew 3¾ pe rcent in the second qua rter, with private 
consumption accounting for more than half of that growth.  Consumption has increased at 
a 4 percent pace since the third quarter of 2009, a touch above its average over the decade 
prior to the crisis.  In Canada’s housing sector, building permits have returned to the level

Summary of the EU-Wide Stress-Test Exercise 
The Committee of European Banking 
Supervisors, EU national bank supervisory  
authorities, and individual financial institutions 
released the results  of  their EU-wide stress-test 
exercise on Friday, July 23.  The objective of thisexercise was to assess the resilience of EU banks 
to possible adverse economic developments, 
including increased credit , market, and sovereign 
risks.  
The exerci
se covered a sample of 91 European 
credit institutions, representing 65 percent of the 
total assets of the EU banking sector and at  least 
50 percent of banking-sector assets in each of the  
27 EU member countries.  To the surprise of 
some  market participants, the Europeans met the 
challenge of coordinating, with a very short deadline, among national, transnational, and 
private parties  to achieve the jo  int  publication of 
detailed results. 
The stress test was performed at the bank level and focused on assessing cr edit risk and potential 
losses under three macroeconomic scenarios:  a benchmark scenario, which assumed a continued moderate recovery from the severe 2008–09 
downturn; an  adverse scenario, which assumed a 
“double-dip” recession with  the level of GDP 
falling 3 percent below  EU  baseline projections  
by 2011; and an even more adverse scenario, which combined the recession assumption with 
interest rate adjustments motivated by a 
postulated heightening of the European sovereign  
debt crisis.  The assumptions behind the scenarioswere used to calculate the corresponding losses 
by portfolio and by country of asset—although 
national supervisors allowed some bank-level 
differences—and to estimate country-specific 
haircuts for government bonds held in the trading  
book.  The sovereign risk scenario  did not 
incorporate default on any government bonds, as  such defaul
t was perceived by EU officials to be 
a “highly implausible” event.  As a result, the  
 haircuts applied only to sovereign bonds held  in  
the trading book, a restriction that has been  
criticized in market commentary.  However, the  
sovereign stress was assume d to feed through to  
the banking book through higher losses on credit  
to the pri  vate sector caus ed by the increases in 
interest rates. 
Results 
A bank was determined to be resilient if its 
estimated Tier 1 capital ratio under the combined 
adverse scenario and sovereign risk shock was at  
least 6 percent as of the end of 2011.  Seven of the 91  banks included in the test di  d not meet 
this benchmark.  These banks, which had an  
aggregate capital shortfall of  €3.5 billion, are 
located in  three countries:  Spain (accounting for 
five of the banks and €2.0 billion of the 
shortfall), Germany (acco unting for one of the  
banks and €1.2 billion of the shortfall) and Greece (accounting for one of the banks and 
€0.2 billion of the shortfall).  To address the 
weaknesses revealed by the test, each of these 
banks was asked to  propose a recapitalization  
plan, to be implemented within  a given  time 
frame and in agreement with the national supervisory  authorities.   
EU officials project that, in  aggregate, 
impairment and trading losses under the adverse scenario including the ad  ditional sovereign 
shock would amount to about €566 billion through the end of next year.  Of those losses, 
the bulk (nearly 90 percent) derives from losses 
on loans and other assets in the banking book  
and the remainder from  markdowns of assets 
held in the trading book, including sovereign 
debt.

In the run-up to the publication of the test results, 
significant concerns surfaced regarding the 
credibility and transparency  of the test.  
Upon publication,  the estimated  recapitalizations  
required were  well below analysts’ estimates.  
Yet, the results appear to have been reasonably well received, in part because sufficient 
information was released to  allow outside 
analysts and investors to make their own  
evaluations.   Analysts’ post-test estimates of 
additional capital required for the European 
banking sector  ranged between €11 billion and 
€63 billion, considerably less than  the funds 
already set aside by national authorities and the 
EU.  These same analysts estimated that an  
additional 6 to 17 banks, besides the 7 selected by  
the official stress-test exercise, would have failed 
more stringent tests.  Nevertheless, the post-test 
analyst reports were ge nerally seen to be  
reassuring about  the resilience of  the European  
banking system.   
Sovereign Debt Exposures 
In additio
n to releasing the test results, the banks 
also disclosed their sove reign debt exposures to 
individual EU countri es, including  Greece,  
Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.  Importantly, 
the banks disclosed total exposures in  the banking 
and trading books as well as exposures net of collateral and hedges,  which appear to have 
reduced uncertainty  surrounding banks’ 
exposures to peripheral  European  countries.  
Comparison with the U.S. Supervisory Capital Assessment Program The EU exercise shared  many features with the 
U.S. Supervisory Capital Assessment Program  
(SCAP) conducted in early 2009, th  ough  the differences between the tests are notable.  The 
two exercises ran benchmark (or baseline) and 
adverse scenarios over a similar time frame  
(two years) and consider ed adverse changes in  
GDP, unemployment, and property prices in the  
scenarios.  The EU test included a common upward shift to each EU  country’s yield curve 
and a set of country-specific upward shocks to government bond yields, while the SCAP did not  
include explicit yield curve assumptions.  
The EU test used the Tier 1 capital ratio (with a  
threshold of 6 percent) as its sole metric, 
whereas the SCAP used both the Tier 1 capital 
ratio  (also  with  a threshold of 6 percent) and the  
Tier 1 common equity ratio (with a threshold of 4 percent).  EU officials have indicated that they chose the Tier 1 capital ratio because of its  
harmonized and precise legal definition across EU countries.  Other measures of capital, it was 
noted, would not allow  direct comparison of 
results across countries.  However, Tier 1 capital may include lower-quality elements, such  as 
certain preferred shares, that are excluded from  
the more restrictive Tier 1 common equity.  As 
such, EU officials may have decided to focus on  
the more inclusive Tier 1 ratio also because they desired to count the sizable government capital  
injections into banks (more than €200 billion in 2008 and 2009), much of which was in  the form  
of preferred shares, as bank capital.

of the boom years of 2006 and 2007.  Going fo rward, we expect growth to moderate 
slightly to 3¼ percent, in part reflecting tighter monetary policy. 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook  
   U.K. real GDP accelerated notably in th e second quarter, to a 4.5 percent pace, 
with the construction sector rebounding shar ply.  The GDP release confirmed surveys 
that had shown a robust recover y, even as previous data on re al activity had been weak.  
Nonetheless, consumer confidence declined further in July, hindered, in part, by poor job 
prospects and impaired hous ehold balance sheets.   
 We continue to project that AFE infla tion will remain subdued this year and will 
pick up only moderately on average in 2011.  In  response to weakening energy prices in 
the spring, headline inflation in the AFEs excluding Japan fell from 2½ percent in the 
first quarter to ½ percent in the second.  This decline was faster than we had anticipated 
in June, although the surprise mainly reflect ed weaker-than-expect ed energy prices in 
Canada.  With core inflation generally quiescent amid sizable output gaps, headline 
inflation should remain contained in thes e economies throughout the forecast period.  In 
Japan, we project that defla tion will attenuate only slight ly, as the output gap remains 
substantial.  
 With inflation prospects still contai ned, the outlook for AF E monetary policy 
remains largely as it was in June.  Amid weak output growth and subdued inflationary 
pressures, the ECB is likely to maintain eas y monetary and liquid ity conditions and to 
keep its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1 percent through the end of the forecast 
period.  We still expect that the Bank of Engl and’s first policy rate hike will occur in the 
middle of 2011 and that the Bank of Japan will remain on hold well beyond the end of  
next year.  The Bank of Canada raised its policy rate to 75 basis points at its July 
meeting, and we assume it will continue to ti ghten going forward, but at a slightly slower 
pace than previously anticipated.   
 Our assumptions for AFE fiscal policy are also little changed since the June 
Tealbook:  Fiscal policy should have little effect on GDP gr owth this year and reduce 
growth about ¾ percentage point  in 2011.  To date, peripher al euro-area countries have 
been implementing fiscal consolidation plans in line with their commitments.  In Japan, 
the loss of the upper house elections in July  by the governing coali tion has likely delayed 
plans for medium-term fiscal consolidation.  As expected, the U.K. government adopted 
new fiscal targets in late June, calling for the elimination of the stru ctural deficit by 2015.  
We anticipate that these fiscal consolidation efforts in the AFEs will weigh on aggregate

demand.  It is possible, however, that the drag on growth may be less severe than we 
expect, particularly if market confid ence and economic sentiment respond more 
positively to policy measures, a possibility discussed in the box titled “Can Fiscal 
Consolidation Be Stimulative?”  
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
Incoming data point to a moderation of  economic growth in most emerging 
market economies (EMEs).  Among the three EMEs for which we have second-quarter GDP, growth stepped down from its first-qua rter pace—by somewhat more than we had 
expected in China but by less than expected  in Korea and Singapore.  In other EMEs, 
purchasing managers indexes generally have m oved lower but still indicate expansion of 
manufacturing sectors, and industrial production in many countries has begun to 
decelerate, particularly in emerging Asia a nd Brazil.  In contrast, Mexican indicators 
suggest that economic activity rebounded sharpl y in the second quarter, after contracting 
in the first quarter, contributing to the upward revision to EME growth last quarter. 
We are not seeing much adverse effect of  the European situation on the EMEs.  
Flows into emerging-market-dedicated investment funds have rebounded since their 
weakness in May, and EME exports to Europe do not yet show any signs of slowing.

 Can Fiscal Consolidation Be Stimulative?
Standard Keynesian analysis  implies that a fiscal  
consolidation should  induce a persistent 
contraction in output.  However, a  literature 
originating with Giavazzi and Pagano (1990) and 
Alesina and Perotti (1995, 1997) has challenged 
this traditional view by providing evidence  that 
large episodes of fiscal consolidation appear to boost output under certain  conditions.
1  This box 
provides a short overview of this literature,  
highlighting the conditions under which fiscal 
consolidations can be expansionary.   
In a seminal paper, Alesina and Perotti (1997) analyzed annual data  on 62 episodes of large 
fiscal consolidation in OECD countries that occurred between 1960 and 1994.  The authors 
differentiated between successful and 
unsuccessful episodes, with the former defined as 
achieving a sustained reduction in the structural  
deficit of at least 2 percent of GDP after three 
years (or a reduction in government debt of 
5 percent of GDP).   Notably, in the 16 successful 
episodes identified by th ese  criteria, GDP growth 
throughout the consolidation period typically was considerably higher than  the OECD average at  
that time; by contrast, GDP growth was a bit  
lower than the OECD average in t  he 46  
unsuccessful episodes.  
The Alesina and Perotti findings spurred 
substantial interest in identifying t  he conditions  
under which fiscal consolidation might have expansionary effects.  Subsequent research has 
found that fiscal consolidation is more likely to  
be expansionary in an economy that would face an imminent fiscal crisis in the absence of 
corrective action, with a high and rising level of 
government debt and relatively high sovereign 
borrowing  costs.  Against this backdrop, a fiscal consolidation that achieves a durable reduction 
 
in government expenditure can boost real 
 activity by reducing borrowing spreads and lowering  the future expected tax liabilities of 
 households and firms.  These sanguine effects are more likely to the extent that the fiscal  
 consolidation is implemented quickly and  
 decisively, and is large in scale.  Moreover, the  
composition of the fiscal consolidation is crucial. 
 Consolidations that rely mainly on tax increases 
rather than expenditure cuts  typically  reduce 
 growth significantly, reflecting that  high  
prevailing levels of government spending make  additional tax hikes very  distortionary.  
Ireland’s successful fiscal consolidation that 
 occurred between 1987  and 1989 is a prime 
example of stimulative fis cal consolidation.  As 
 shown in the accompanying figure, t  his 
consolidation occurred in an  environment of 
 sharply rising  government debt, large and 
persistent budget deficits, and high sovereign  borrowing costs.  After se veral failed attempts at 
tax-based consolidation, Ireland’s coalition  
government began implementing large and 
 permanent cuts in government spending in 1987.  The consolidation decreased  government 
 expenditure by more than 10  percent of  GDP 
over three years, and sovereign spreads  plummeted.  GDP growth rose considerably  
during the consolidation, in part because o  f  rapid   
growth in domestic demand.  
It bears emphasizing that  there is little  evidence 
 suggesting that fiscal consolidation boosts near-term output for economies that can finance 
 government deficits on favorable terms.  For example, the VAR-based evidence of Ilzetzki 
 and others (2010) shows that fiscal consolidation

production, and a larger payback in Singapore from its unsustainable first-half surge.  As 
expected, inflation in the EMEs dipped in the second quarter, to 2½ percent, on waning 
food and energy prices, and we project that in flation will average about 3 percent through 
the remainder of the forecast period.  
Following the release of second-quarter GDP data for China, which included 
revisions to history, we now estim ate that growth last quarter slowed to an annual rate of 
about 7 percent, suggesting that efforts by Chin ese authorities to cool  the sizzling pace of 
expansion are having their desire d effects.  Consumption, as 
measured by retail sales, and 
net exports were strong, but industrial produc tion and investment moderated, likely in 
response to the effects of waning fiscal stim ulus and some tightening of restraints on 
lending.  Moreover, equity and property pr ices have recently flattened, tempering 
concerns about asset bubbles.  Chinese authorities are unlikely to reverse the course of  
policy tightening in light of these developm ents, but they may reduce its pace.  We  
expect that this tightening will be sufficient  to engineer a soft landing for the Chinese 
economy, with growth averaging near 8½ percent over the remainder of the forecast 
period, down from more than 10 percent during the past year.  
On the whole, other emerging Asian econom ies appear to be decelerating roughly 
in line with our projections in the Ju ne Tealbook.  However, Singapore’s GDP 
unexpectedly surged again in the second quarter , rising 26 percent at an annual rate.  We 
now project a contraction of Singapore’s economy over the second half of the year as its 
volatile manufacturing sector cat ches its breath.  In Korea,  GDP growth stepped down to 
6 percent in the second quarter but still surpassed our expectat ions.  We have the pace of 
Korean growth moderating to about 4¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast period.   
We estimate that GDP growth in Mexico  rebounded to 6 percent in the second 
quarter, owing to a strong expansion of mo tor vehicle production and a moderate rebound 
of agricultural output from its first-quarter contraction.  In contra st, we estimate that 
growth stepped down to about 2¾ percent in Br azil after double-digit growth in the first 
quarter, partly reflecting the withdrawal of ta x incentives for purchases of autos and other 
consumer durables.  For Latin America as a whole, we project that real GDP growth will 
average about 3¾ percent in the second half of  this year and next  year as Mexico’s 
recovery solidifies and the Brazilian economy grows at a more sustainable pace.

DEVELOPMENTS IN GLOBAL TRADE  
Following a stunning collapse at the end of 2008, global trade has rebounded 
sharply since the middle of last year, with an index of real global trade increasing 
23 percent in the 12 months ending in May.  Th is rapid growth has returned the level of 
real trade to the vicinity of its pre-crisis peak, largely on account of the robust 
performance of trade in the emerging market  economies; imports and exports in most 
advanced economies remain below pre-crisis peaks.  
The growth of real global tr ade over the past year has gr eatly exceeded that of real 
global GDP, just as the decline in trade was far steeper than that of GDP during the crisis.  
The greater volatility of trade during the cycle likely reflects  a number of factors, most 
importantly the preponderance of durable goods in trade relative to GDP and the 
interaction of trade and inve ntories.  Recent fluctuations  in trade have been more 
correlated with movements in global industrial production than with global GDP, as 
might be expected given the large proportion of  manufactured goods in trade.  Even so, 
trade has also been more volatile than industrial production, falling more in the crisis and 
rebounding faster in the recovery. 
With global trade approaching its pre-crisis  level and moving closer in line with 
global industrial production, th ere is less scope going forward for the outsized growth 
rates of imports and exports that we observe d over the past year.  Accordingly, trade 
growth will likely slow in the second half of  2010, consistent with our expectation that 
GDP growth in the foreign ec onomies will slow as well.   
Although available data on global trade have yet to record a significant 
deceleration in the pace of the rebound, other more timely indicators hint that such a 
slowdown could be occurring.  One such indi cator is the Baltic Dry Index, which 
measures the price of chartering bulk commod ity cargo ships and is driven to a certain 
extent by the demand for globally traded comm odities.  Since the end of May, the Baltic 
Dry Index has plummeted more than 50 percen t to levels not seen since global trade 
bottomed out in the middle of 2009.  Howeve r, the Baltic Dry Index is an imperfect 
proxy for global trade, as it is affected by a num ber of other factors, including the supply 
of bulk cargo carriers.  A large number of  ships were ordered during the commodity 
boom between 2003 and 2008 and are now in the process of being delivered, leading to 
an increase in the global fleet and weighi ng on shipping prices.  Unlike the Baltic Dry

Index, price indexes for contai ner shipping, such as the Ha rpex Index, have recently 
recorded increases, although they remain quite low by historical standards.  
The resurgence of global trad e over the past year has been accom panied by some  
notable changes in the pattern of external balances across co untries.  In the 12 months  
ending in May, the U.S. trade deficit wi dened by about $200 billion, although this 
widening has retraced only a portion of the $440 billion narrowing of the deficit recorded 
in late 2008 and early 2009.  Of the widening of the deficit that  has occurred over the past 
year, more than half is attributable to a higher oil import bill, primarily reflecting the 
rebound in oil prices.    
As in the United States, large improvements in the trade balances of the euro area 
and Japan over late 2008 and early 2009 have  been partially retr aced.  In contrast, 
China’s trade balance fell during the crisis as exports plunged faster than imports and 
then continued to decline during the initial phase  of the recovery of world trade, as import 
growth outpaced renewed export growth.  Howe ver, in the second qua rter of this year,  
China’s imports flattened out and its exports  soared, causing the c ountry’s trade surplus 
to rebound sharply.

Financial Developments 
Investors appeared to mark down their outlook for economic growth in response 
to weaker-than-expected incoming data over the intermeeting period.  At the same time, 
market participants apparently took some  comfort from the information released in 
association with the European stress-test exercise and seemed  to trim the odds that they 
place on a sharp deterioration in financial ma rket conditions.  In addition, news about 
second-quarter corporate earnings, both in th e United States and abroad, was generally 
upbeat.  On balance, strains in short-term  funding markets eased, corporate bond spreads 
narrowed modestly, and stock prices edged up.  However, with the more subdued outlook 
for growth, market participants pushed back  the expected timing of the commencement 
of policy firming and nominal Treasury yields declined about 20 to 45 basis points.  
Inflation compensation fell, although cha nges in survey measures of inflation 
expectations were mixed.  The broad nomina l value of the dollar declined more than 
2½ percent, likely reflecting some reversal of flight-to-safety flows,  better-than-expected 
foreign economic data, and the softer ec onomic outlook for the United States.   
Household debt is estimated to have contracted again in the second quarter, as 
mortgage debt and consumer credit both appe ar to have declined, although record-low 
mortgage rates led to a pick-up in mortgage refinancings.  Delinquency rates on home mortgages and consumer loans moved lower but were still elevated.  Borrowing by 
nonfinancial businesses was moderate over the intermeeting period, as the pace of bond 
issuance rebounded and the contraction in C&I loans at banks slowed.  Indicators of corporate credit quality stayed solid.  Financ ing conditions for comm ercial real estate 
remained difficult, although there were scattered signs of improvement. 
Commercial banks’ core loans declined in June and July, but at a slower pace than 
earlier in the year.  The July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending 
Practices (SLOOS) showed a second straight quarter of  modest unwinding of the 
widespread tightening of st andards that occurred during the financial crisis.  Bank 
earnings continued to recover in the second quarter, lifted by reductions in loan loss 
provisions.  M2 was little changed in July, as declines in small time deposits and retail 
money market funds offset increases  in liquid deposits and currency.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Money market futures rates decr eased over the intermeeting period.1  The 
FOMC’s decision at its June meeting to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the 
federal funds rate and the language in th e accompanying statement were in line with 
investor expectations and elicited relatively little market reaction.  Upon release of the 
minutes of the meeting, the expected path of policy declined somewhat, as investors 
reportedly focused on the downward revisions to the Committee’s growth and inflation 
forecasts and on the Committee’s assessment th at the risks to the economic outlook were 
tilted to the downside.  Futures rates also  moved down in response to the Chairman’s 
remarks during the semiannual monetary pol icy testimony that the economic outlook is 
“unusually uncertain” and that policy makers ar e prepared “to take further policy actions 
as needed.”  Some weaker-than-expected ec onomic data also reportedly contributed to 
the decline in market intere st rates during the period.   
Futures quotes, combined with the usual staff assumptions for term premiums, 
indicate that market particip ants’ expected policy path now rises above the current 0 to 
¼ percent target range in th e third quarter of 2011.  The e xpected policy path implies a 
federal funds rate of around 1.0 percent in  the fourth quarter of 2012, about 50 basis 
points below the level expect ed at the time of the June  FOMC meeting.  Quotes on 
interest rate caps suggest that the modal path  of the federal funds rate also moved down 
over the period; this path does not rise above  the current target range until the third 
quarter of 2012.  
Consistent with financial market quotes, results from the August survey of 
primary dealers suggest that market participants  lowered their expectations for the path of 
the federal funds rate.  Respondents reported an average probability of about 70 percent 
that the first tightening would occur in the third quarter of 2011 or later, compared with a 
probability of about 35 percent in the June su rvey.  The dealers as signed probabilities of 
about 25 percent to the Federal Reserve loweri ng the interest rate pa id on excess reserves 
or expanding its balance sheet through additional purchases be fore the end of the year.  
They attached a probability of around 35 percent to the Committee modifying its policy 
language describing how it will cha nge interest rates over time and a probability of nearly 
45 percent to the Federal Reserve reinves ting proceeds of maturing agency MBS.  
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 18 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging 4 basis points.  Trading volumes have moved lower since the last 
intermeeting period.

Conditional on the Federal Reserve reinves ting proceeds of maturing agency MBS, 
dealers thought it was about equally likely that the proceeds would be reinvested in 
Treasury securities or agency MBS. 
Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securiti es fell about 20 to 45 basis points on 
net over the interm
eeting period, with declines particularly  notable at intermediate 
maturities.  As with policy expectations, thes e declines largely reflected Federal Reserve 
communications as well as weaker-than-expected economic data.  Model estimates 
suggest that some of the declin e in Treasury yields might be attributable to a lower term 
premium, consistent with a drop in implied volatility on 10-year Treas ury yields over the 
period.  TIPS-based inflation compensation decreased 19 basis points at the 5-year 
horizon, mainly driven by weaker-than-expect ed data on headline in flation and economic 
activity.  Five-year inflation compensation five  years ahead declined 17 basis points, on 
net.  Declines in inflation-swap-based measur es of inflation compensation were similar to
those based on TIPS, while changes in survey measures of inflation expectations were 
mixed.  
ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad stock price indexes increased sli ghtly, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
as generally upbeat earnings news and an easi ng of anxiety about the fiscal situation in 
Europe were partly offset by growing concer ns about the strength of the U.S. economic  
recovery.  Option-implied volatility on th e S&P 500 index declined but remained 
somewhat elevated by historical standards.  The spread between the staff’s estimate of the
expected real return on equity for S&P 500 fi rms and an estimate of the real 10-year 
Treasury yield—a rough measure of the equity  risk premium—was lit tle changed at an 
elevated level.    
Yields on investm
ent- and speculative -grade corporate bonds decreased, and 
spreads to comparable-maturity Treasury securities declined moderately over the 
intermeeting period.  Prices in the secondary market for leveraged loans firmed a bit, and 
bid-asked spreads on these lo ans continued to edge down. 
Financial stock prices moved about in  line with broader indexes over the 
intermeeting period, and CDS spreads for la rge financial institutions narrowed 
moderately.  Financial firms’ second-quart er earnings generally beat analysts’ 
expectations as improvements in loan performance led banks to re duce their loan loss

provisioning.  However, large banks reporte d declines in revenues from investment 
banking and capital markets activities.  In light of the softer economic outlook, some  
analysts questioned the sustai nability of profits, particularly for regional banks.  
Moreover, market participants indicated that regulatory changes mandated by U.S. 
financial reform legislation continued to be  a significant source of uncertainty about 
future earnings for financial firms.  On Ju ly 27, citing the potential effects of the new 
legislation on implicit government support for banks, Moody’s announced that it had put 
senior debt and deposit ratings for seve ral large bank holding companies on negative 
watch and stated that it was reviewing for possible downgrade the ratings of 10 large U.S. 
regional banks.  The announcement elicited little market reaction. 
Conditions in short-term funding ma rkets im proved somewhat over the 
intermeeting period.  Spreads of term Libor  over rates on overnight index swaps (OIS) 
moved down at one-, three-, and six-month hor izons.  Liquidity in term funding markets 
appears to have improved, with funding reporte dly available for maturities out to six 
months, though tiering was said  to persist.  Spreads on unsecured 30-day financial 
commercial paper were little changed at a low level.  In secured funding markets, spreads 
on 30-day asset-backed commercial paper moved down over the intermeeting period, and 
rates and collateral haircuts for repurchase agre ements held steady across collateral types.   
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS   
Investor concerns about the euro area appear to have eased somewhat over the 
intermeeting period, while at the same time ma rket participants seemed to shift their 
focus toward concerns about prospects for global growth more generally.   
The information released in conjunction w ith the EU stress-test  exercise appears 
to have had a positive effect on investor sentim ent.  In the week following the release of  
the results, sovereign CDS premiums for peri phery countries narrowed.  There is less 
evidence that the test results had a signifi cant effect on bank fundi ng markets, although 
immediately following the release several European banks announ ced plans to issue 
medium-term debt.  (For more details on th e stress test, see the box, “Summary of the 
EU-Wide Stress Test Exercise,” in the “International Economic Developments and 
Outlook” section.)  Investors also seemed to  take comfort from several oversubscribed 
auctions of government debt by Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and even Greece, although the 
extent to which moral suasion was used to en courage institutions to bid is not clear.

purchases of sovereign debt in recent weeks,  spreads of yields on the 10-year sovereign 
bonds of Ireland, Portugal, and Spain relative to German bunds narrowed over the period.  
The spread on Greek debt also narrowed in recent weeks but is up for the period as a 
whole.   
Headline European equity indexes were modestly higher, but European bank 
stocks in
creased more than 13 percent, spurred by some positive earnings announcements 
as well as by cautious optimism about the st ress test results and the announcement that 
some aspects of the Basel III bank capital rule s would be less stringe nt than originally 
proposed.  The lack of any disruption to market functioning following the maturation of 
the ECB’s first one-year refinancing operation on July 1 also seemed to inspire some 
confidence.  The outstanding amount of euro  liquidity supplied by ECB refinancing 
operations has declined over €300 billion si nce the one-year operation matured; the 
EONIA rate rose as much as 20 basis points after the end of the operation but has since 
fallen back close to its level in June.   
Consistent with these developments, market  expectations of ove rnight rates in the 
euro area appear to have increased, while expectations of overnight rates in the United Kingdom and Japan appear little  changed.  As in the United States, benchmark sovereign 
yields decreased in the Unite d Kingdom and Japan.  German yields, supported in part by 
the rise in expected overnight rates, were unchanged on net. 
The foreign exchange value of the dollar declined about  4½ percent, on net, over 
the period on a trade-weighted basis agai nst the major foreign currencies and about 
¾ percent on average against the emerging market currencies.  Spurred by some reversal 
of flight-to-safety flows as financial system strains in Eu rope diminished, better-than-
expected foreign economic data, and some w eak U.S. economic data releases, the dollar 
depreciated about 7 percent against the euro a nd sterling and 5 percent against the yen.   
The renminbi has risen about ¾ percent si nce authorities in China announced that 
they would take steps to increase the flexib ility of their currency against the dollar.  
However, the renminbi has moved little in rece nt weeks.  Weaker-than-expected second-
quarter growth in China and signs that the c ountry’s housing market may be cooling have 
led investors to scale back the amount of m onetary policy tightening expected there over 
the next year.  Elsewhere in emerging Asia, the central banks of South Korea, Taiwan, 
Thailand, Malaysia, and India increased policy ra tes.  In Latin America, the central banks 
of Brazil and Chile continued to tighten moneta ry policy.  Equity prices in most emerging

market economies have risen since the la st FOMC meeting, and flows into emerging 
market equity funds continued to be strong.   
Foreign official purchases of U.S. assets resumed in June after net sales in May.  
Data on custody holdings at the Federal Rese rve Bank of New York show that foreign 
official holdings increased robustly in July ; the rise was concentrated in T
reasury 
securities.  Private investment from abroad reflected market tensions in May and June, 
with strong safe-haven flows into Treasury securities and very weak demand for other 
U.S. securities; U.S. investors so ld foreign securities in June. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
The average interest rate on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages fell to 
4.54 percent, the lowest level in th e 39-year history of this series.2  MBS yields dropped 
about in line with Treasury yields.3  The volume of mortgage refinancing applications 
picked up in June and July to levels co mparable to those registered in early 2009, 
although insufficient home equity and damage d credit histories may be preventing many 
borrowers from refinancing (see the box, “How  Many Borrowers Have an Incentive to 
Refinance and Are Likely Able to Do So?”).   House prices increas ed notably during the 
spring; the FHFA, LoanPerformance, and 20- city S&P/Case-Shiller house price indexes 
all rose in April and May.  Delinquency rate s on outstanding mortgages have declined in 
recent months, in part because the share of mortgages becoming newly delinquent has ticked down, and also because delinquent mo rtgages entering loan modification programs 
are being reclassified as “curren t.”  Home mortgage debt is es timated to have declined at 
an annual rate of 2 percen t in the second quarter.   
Consumer credit is estimated to have contr acted at an annual rate of 4¼ percent in 
the second quarter, as revolvi ng credit continued to declin e steeply while nonrevolving 
credit edged down.  Consumer ABS issuance sl owed a bit in July, reflecting in part 
2 More recent daily data from LoanSifter indicate that mortgage rates have continued to decline after 
July 28, the last observation shown in the exhibit. 
3 Fails to deliver in the agency MBS market remain ed elevated over the inte rmeeting period, reflecting 
the low level of short-term interest rates, which redu ces the cost of failing to deliver, and the scarcity of 
deliverable securities with 5 and 5.5 percent coupons.  The Federal Reserve's coupon swap operations 
reportedly helped to ease these pressures to some degree.  Other indicators of liquidity also continue to 
point to strains in this market, but there are few signs that these conditions have impeded the functioning of 
the primary mortgage market.

  How Many Borrowers Have an Incentive to Refinance and Are Lik ely Able to Do So?
The historically low level of mortgage rates has  
created  a substantial incentive for many 
borrowers to refinance th eir mortgages.  Indeed, 
the index of refinancing applications rose  more  
than  40 percent in June and remained at that 
 elevated level  in July.  Refinancing can lower 
borrowers’ mortgage payments and reduce debt  
service burdens, thereby improving their financial 
positions.  This box explores the incentives to 
refinance and discusses some  potential 
constraints on refinancing activity.  
To measure the financial incentive to refinance, 
we consider the difference between the interest 
rate on loans currently outstanding and the  
contract rate on new conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.  The figure below plots the 
cumulative distribution of interest rates on  
outstanding prime, fixed-rate loans in May 2010 (the latest month  for which the data are 
available).
1  Almost 90 percent of outstanding 
mortgages had an interest rate that was above the  
average contract rate that  prevailed in July on  
new conforming 30-year fixed-rate loans.   More 
than  50 percent of  borrowers had a large incentive to  refinance in the sense that  their loan  
carried an interest rate more than 1 percentage  
 point greater than the July contract rate.   A back-
of-the-envelope calculation suggests that  
refinancing would reduce the monthly payment 
of these borrowers by an  average of $180.  In 
addition, about one-fourth of loans had an  
interest rate between ½ and 1 percentage point 
more than the July contract rate, giving those 
borrowers a moderate incenti ve to refinance.  We 
estimate the average monthly savings for these borrowers to be about $100.  
Despite the potential interest savings, tight credit  
conditions may prevent many borrowers from  
refinancing for at least two reasons.  First,  
following several years of steep house price 
declines, many borrowers currently have less 
than 20  percent equity in  their homes, making  it 
difficult to refinance given that most private lenders require a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio 
below 80 percent.  Accordingly, we assume that  
any  mortgage  with an LTV ratio greater than 
80 percent will not be refinanced, unless the 
borrower is eligible fo r the Home Affordable 
1 Prime, fixed-rate loans constituted the bulk of outstanding first-lien mortgages—78 percent in May 2010.  We 
exclude subprime and adjustable-rate mortgages because the incentive to refinance is less sensitive to the current 
rate available on new fixe d-rate mort gages.  ________________

 Refinance Plan (HARP).2   Under this program, 
 borrowers with an LTV of up to 125 percent may be  
able to refinance if their existing loan is guaranteed  
by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and if they are not 
delinquent on  the loan.  As shown in the table, only  
35 percent  of loans in  May 2010  had both a large 
incentive to refinance and a  qualifying LTV  
(through either a private channel or HARP).   
Second, borrowers may be unable to refinance 
because their credi
t  is impaired.  To adjust  our 
estimates for this constraint, we exclude loans that  
were delinquent at any point in  the previous year.  
Combining the LTV/HARP and credit-quality  
criteria, we estimate that only 32 percent of all 
prime, fixed-rate loans—or 60 percent of the loans 
with a large incentive to refinance—had a large  
incentive to refinance and appear likely to  be 
eligible to do so.  These same criteria suggest that an  
additional 15 percent of borrowers had  a moderate 
incentive to refinance and would likely be eligible.  
Of course, if the contract rate on new mortgages were to fall appreci
ably further, borrowers’ incentive to refinance would increase.  As shown in 
the last row of the first column of the table, the 
potential step-up in refinancing activity under such 
conditions could be considerable because a 
substantial fraction of borrowers fall into this 
category and have suitable LTV ratios and credit  
histories.  
The staff forecast for re financing activity is 
substantially lower than would be implied by the 
calculations  presented in this  discussion, owing to 
large transactions costs and other barriers to refinancing.
3   For example, take-up rates under 
HARP are  much lower than we   initially projected.   
Moreover, be  cause the refinancing process now  
takes more time and mortgage originators continue to be capacity constrained, we expect some 
refinancing activity to be delayed.  Consequently, 
conditional on our expectation that mortgage rates 
remain low, the current refinancing wave could be 
drawn out through the end of the year.   
2 Requiring an LTV of 80 percent might be too strict because some borrowers might be able to refinance through 
the FHA, which allows higher LTVs, and other borrowers migh t be able to bring cash to the settlement.  However, 
our measure of LTV does not include second liens, so we are underestimating the total debt on the property in 
many cases. 
3 Not only does refinancing entail monetary and time costs, but some evidence points to other, possibly 
nonrational, barriers.  For example, about 5 percent of borrowers in the 1980s were extremely unlikely to prepay 
their mortgage, regardless of the apparent financial incentive (See Yongheng Deng, John M. Quigley, and Robert 
Van Order (2000), “Mortgage Terminations, Heteroge neity and the Exercise of Mortgage Options,” 
Econometrica, vol. 68, pp. 275–307).

typical seasonal patterns.4  Consumer credit quality continued to improve, with 
delinquency and charge-off rates for most t ypes of consumer loans moving down in 
recent months, though they remain elevated.  Sp reads of credit card interest rates over 
Treasury yields stayed at a relatively high le vel in May, while interest rate spreads on 
auto loans at captive finance companies remained  near the middle of their range in recent 
years.   
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Net debt financing of nonfinan cial corporations picked up in July.  Gross issuance 
of nonfinancial bonds rebounded from relative ly subdued levels in May and June, and 
nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding cont inued to expand.  C& I loans contracted 
again in July, but at a much slower pace than  earlier this year, consistent with results 
from the SLOOS indicating some net easing of banks’ lending polic ies to nonfinancial 
firms as well as a reported stabilization in de mand for C&I loans.  Issuance of syndicated 
leveraged loans increased further in th e second quarter and lending by institutional 
investors continued to pick up, but deals we re reportedly financed under somewhat more 
stringent terms in the wake of the recent fina ncial strains in Europe as investors pulled 
back from risk-taking. 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinanci al firms was moderate in June and 
July.  In the first quarter, e quity retirements from  share repurchases and cash-financed 
mergers picked up slightly, and net equity  issuance remained negative.      
Most second-quarter earnings reports for S&P 500 firms have easily exceeded 
Wall Street analyst forecasts, and based on nearly 400 earnings reports in hand and 
analyst forecasts for the rest, operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms are 
estimated to have grown at a quarterly rate of  nearly 5 percent.  However, firms’ forward-
looking guidance was somewhat cautious, and an alysts did not significantly revise their 
forecasts for year-ahead earnings in th e four weeks ending in mid-July.   
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms appears to have remained solid.  The 
aggregate ratio of liquid assets to total asse ts for nonfinancial corporations stayed in 
4 ABS issuance stalled briefly in the middle of July when rating agencies refused to allow their ratings 
to be included in the prospectuses of publicly issued deals because of  liability concerns arising from the 
financial reform legislation. However, the SEC subsequently provided guidance that facilitated a 
resumption of issuance.  The SEC has proposed revisions to Regulation AB that effectively would resolve 
this issue by eliminating the investment-grade rating requirement for shelf registrations.

record-high territory in the first quarter, wh ile the debt-to-asset ratio declined a bit 
further.  July saw very few bond ratings changes, though in June the dollar value of 
nonfinancial corporate bonds upgraded by Moody’s significantly outpaced that of 
downgraded bonds—continuing the pattern evident since the beginning of the year.  The six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfin ancial firms edged down a bit further in 
June to just above zero.  Nonetheless, the KMV expected year-ahead default rate for 
nonfinancial firms remained somewhat el evated through early August, reflecting 
continued low equity valuations and higher-than-normal volatility. 
Commercial real estate ma rkets remained under pressure .  Comm
 ercial mortgage 
debt is estimated to have posted another sizable decline in the second quarter, and the 
delinquency rate for securitized commercial mo rtgages climbed to 8½ percent in June.  
However, commercial real estate prices appe ar to have increased in the second quarter, 
although the low level of transactions makes it difficult to discern whether prices have 
reached a trough.  Meanwhile, some signs of stabilization in financing conditions have  
emerged in the past few months.  Investor  demand for high-quality CMBS is reportedly 
robust, although issuance remains muted due to  a lack of eligible loans.  In addition, 
lenders generally appear willing to extend financing for legacy commercial real estate  
assets for which cash flows suffice to cover debt service, but less so for assets with 
inadequate cash flows. 
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Over the intermeeting period, the Treas ury auctioned about $240 billion of 
nominal coupon securities and $12 billion of 10-year TIPS.  The Treasury continued to 
trim the sizes of auctions of nominal securities, but the 10-year TIPS auction was larger 
than usual.  Bid-to-cover ratios of most au ctions exceeded historical averages.  At its 
quarterly refunding announcement, the Treasury i ndicated that it would likely continue to 
trim the auction sizes of nominal coupon securities at a gradual pace but that it is considering more frequent reopenings of TIPS offerings in an effort to improve liquidity 
in the TIPS market. 
Gross issuance of long-term  municipal bonds slowed a bit in July, while short-
term issuance was moderate.  Municipal yiel ds declined over the intermeeting period, and 
the ratio of yields on long-te rm municipal bonds to those on comparable-maturity high-
grade corporate bonds was little changed, on net, at a relatively high level.

COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY   
Commercial banks’ core loans—the sum  of C&I, real estate, and consumer 
loans—are estimated to have contracted at about a 4½ percent annua l rate on average in 
June and July.  The runoff in C&I loans in  those two months was appreciably smaller 
than the declines seen earlier in the year.  In contrast, co mmercial real estate loans 
continued to decline steeply, a nd residential real estate lo ans also decreased, in part 
because of increased sales and securitizations  of loans with the GSEs.  Consumer loans 
were about flat, on balance, as reductions in cr edit card loans about offset an increase in 
nonrevolving consumer loans.  Total bank credit has been buffeted recently by large 
adjustments to securities holdings at a few large banks, and substantial growth in 
securities and noncore loans ove r the first three weeks of Ju ly suggests that bank credit 
could post its first monthly in crease since February 2009.   
The July SLOOS indicated a second strai ght quarter of modest unwinding of the 
widespread tightening of standards that occurred during the financial crisis, particularly by larger banks, and respondents noted that loan demand had continued to weaken, on 
balance.  A small net fraction of domestic respondents reported that they had eased 
standards for C&I loans in the second quart er, and a significant net fraction of banks 
noted that they had trimmed the cost of cred it lines and reduced spreads of C&I loan rates 
over their cost of funds, even for small firms.  Among the respondents that eased 
standards or terms on C&I loans,  nearly all cited more aggre ssive competition from other 
banks or nonbank lenders as an important reason for doing so, and about half cited a 
“more favorable or less uncertain economic out look.”  In contrast, banks continued to 
tighten their standards on CRE loans, but the net fraction doing so edged down to about 
5 percent.  Small net fractions of resp ondents reported having eased standards on 
residential real estate and consumer loan s; larger banks accounted for most of the 
reported easing.  Banks reported an increased willingness to make consumer installment 
loans, on balance, for the third consecutive quarter. 
M2 was little changed in Ju ly after expanding slightly in the second quarter.  The 
subdued growth of M2 relative to nomina l GDP probably continued to reflect an 
unwinding of safe-haven flows as well as the ve ry low rates of return on M2 assets.  In 
particular, small time deposits and retail mone y market mutual funds have continued to 
contract, reflecting especially low returns on these assets relative to other instruments.  In contrast, liquid deposits expanded through July, likely boosted by substitution from

Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period  
Total assets of the Federal Reserve edged down 
over the intermeeting period to $2.33 trillion.  
Securities held  outright decreased $17 billion, 
reflecting a net decline of $11 billion in  the 
principal balance of agency mortgage-backed  
securities (MBS) and the maturing of $6 billion in agency debt securities.  In late June, the Trading 
Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
conducted several agency MBS coupon swap operations in order to  facilitate the timely  
settlement of outstanding Federal Reserve agency  
MBS purchases.  In these operations, the  Desk 
effectively sold $9.2 billion in relatively scarce,  
5.5 percent coupon issues and simultaneously  
purchased  a corresponding amount of lower-
coupon securities that were more readily  
available for settlement, and which were delivered in a timely  manner.   
Liquidity provided to financial institutions and  
lending through other credit  facilities declined  a  
touch.  Primary credit remained at a low level and foreign central bank liquidity swaps outstanding  
under the reestablished arrangements increased slightly.   
On June 30, 2010, the Federal Reserve closed the 
Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 
(TALF) for new loan extensions against newly  
issued commercial mortgage-backed securities. The TALF had been closed  for new loans against  
all other types of collateral since March 31, 2010, and there had been no loan requests since the 
March subscription.  Over the intermeeting  
period, 
 prepayments reduced total TALF loans 
outstanding by about $3 billion.    Consistent with the terms of the Maiden Lane LLC transaction, on Ju ly 15, the LLC began  
making distributions to  repay  the loan it received  
from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  
To date, these distributions have totaled 
$30 million; they will occur on a monthly  basis 
unless otherwise directed  by the Federal 
Reserve.  In addition, the Federal Reserve 
released  updated fair value estimates of the three 
Maiden Lane portfolios.  The fair values of the 
three portfolios increased about $2 billion  since 
the June FOMC, and a  ll three portfolio v  alues  
exceed the corresponding  loans outstanding from  
the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York. 
On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s supplementary  
financing account remained steady at $200 billion, while the Treasury’s general  
account increased $15 bill ion on balance over 
the period.  Reserve balances of depository  
institutions fell $41 billion to $1.01 trillion.  In  
preparation for future reserve draining  
operations, over the intermeeting period, two small-value auctions were conducted through the 
Term Deposit Facility.  Both auctions were well-
subscribed, with bid-to-cover ratios in excess of 
3.5.  In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York began to conduct a series of small-
scale, real-value reverse repurchase transactions 
with primary dealers using all eligible  collateral  
types, including, for the first time, agency MBS 
from the SOMA portfolio.  The first of these 
operations will settle on August 5 and will mature on August 6.

Appendix 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surve y on Bank Lending Practices  
The July 2010 Senior Loan Officer Opini on Survey indicated that, on net, banks eased 
standards and terms over the previous three mont hs on loans in some categories, particularly  
those affected by competitive pressures from other banks or from nonbank lenders.1  Nonetheless, 
lending standards appear to remain quite tight for many households and businesses.  Moreover, 
while the survey results suggest that lending cond itions are beginning to ease, the improvement to 
date has been concentrated at large domestic banks.2  Most banks reported that demand for 
business and consumer loans was about unchanged.   
Domestic survey respondents reported easing standards and most terms on C&I loans to 
firms of all sizes, a move that continues a slow unwinding of the widespread tightening that 
occurred over the past few years.  Moreover, this is the first survey  that has shown an easing of 
standards on C&I loans to small firms since late 2006.3  Significant net fractions of domestic 
banks also reported having eased th eir pricing of C&I loans to firms of all sizes.  Banks pointed  
to increased competition in the market for C&I lo ans as an important factor behind the recent 
easing of terms and standards.  Demand for C&I loans from large and middle-market firms and from  small firms was reportedly little  changed, on net, over the survey  period after declining over 
the three months prior to the April survey.   
On net, large domestic banks reported easing standards and terms on almost all of the 
different categories of loans to households.  Ot her banks showed either smaller net fractions 
easing lending policies or a net tightening of lending policies.  Regarding residential real estate lending, a few large banks reported having eased standards on prime mortgage loans, while a modest net fraction of the remaining banks repor ted having tightened standards on such loans.  
Banks reported an increased willingness to make cons umer installment loans, on balance, for the 
third consecutive quarter, and small net fracti ons of banks reported having eased standards on 
both credit card and other consumer loans.  Howe ver, these indicators of increased availability of 
credit were countered by small net fractions of respondents reporting having tightened the terms 
and conditions on credit card loans. 
1 The July 2010 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses and 
households over the past three months.  The survey also included a set of special questions that asked banks 
about lending to affiliates and subsidiaries of banks and nonfinancial companies headquartered in Europe.  This appendix is based on responses from 57 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Respondent banks received the survey on or after July 13, 2010, and responses were due by July 27, 2010. 
2 Large banks are defined as banks with assets  greater than $20 billion as of March 31, 2010. 
3 Small firms are defined as firms with annual sales of less than $50 million.

LENDING TO BUSINESSES  
Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending 
 The July survey showed a modest net fraction of domestic respondents had eased 
standards for lending to large and middle-market  firms over the previous three months—the 
second consecutive survey showing such an easing.  For the first time since 2006, banks reported 
having eased their lending standards on C&I loans to small firms.  In particular, around one-fifth 
of large domestic banks reported an easing of lendi ng standards for small firms, which offset a 
net tightening of standards by  a small fraction of other banks.  
Many  banks had eased the terms on C&I loans, with especially sizable net fractions of 
domestic banks reporting that they had reduced spre ads of loan rates over their bank’s cost of 
funds and had trimmed the costs of credit lines.  On net, large domestic banks eased each of the 
seven surveyed loan terms for firms of all sizes.  Other domestic banks reported a net easing of 
the spread of loan rates over their own cost of funds and of the costs associated with credit lines, 
but small net fractions of those banks reported having increased premiums for riskier borrowers 
and tightened the majority  of nonprice loan terms, particularly loan covenants.  Domestic banks 
also reported that they had stopped reducing th e size of existing credit lines for commercial and 
industrial firms, on net—the first time that banks  had not reported cutting such lines since these 
questions were added in January 2009.   
Nearly all of the respondents that eased standards or terms on C&I loans cited more  
aggressive competition from other ba nks or nonbank lenders (other fi nancial intermediaries or the 
capital markets) as an important reason for doing so, and about one-half of those respondents pointed to a more favorable or less uncertain economic outlook.  The easing in the price terms on 
C&I loans reported by large banks for large and middle-market firms and the reported influence 
of increased competition from other lenders are cons istent with the recent reduction in loan rate 
spreads in the syndicated loan ma rket.  However, those spreads re main quite elevated relative to 
their long-run averages.  Respondents that ha d tightened lending policies—primarily smaller 
banks in the sample—generally attributed the move to a less favorable or more uncertain 
economic outlook, rather than bank-specific factor s such as concerns about capital or liquidity  
positions.   
On balance, demand for C&I loans from large and middle-market firms and from small 
firms changed little.  In the April survey, banks  had reported weaker demand from firms of all 
sizes.  A shift in customer borrowing to their bank from other credit sources and customers’  
increased financing needs for inventory  and receivables were the most common reasons cited by  
banks that had experienced higher loan demand.  The net percentage of respondents that pointed 
to customers’ increased investment in plant or equipment as an important reason for stronger demand for C&I loans also edged up relative to the April survey.  A sizable jump  in the net 
percentage of banks that reported an increase in the number of inquiries regarding new or 
increased lines of credit suggests that C&I loan demand could strengthen.

In the July survey, U.S. branches and agen cies of foreign banks reported that their 
standards for approving C&I loans had remained basically unchanged, after having reported a net 
easing of such standards in April.  Small net fr actions of foreign respondents still reported an 
easing of most loan terms in the current survey, but the easing was much less widespread than in 
the April survey.  Moreover, branches and agencies had tightened premiums charged on riskier  
loans, on balance, a move that was due pr imarily to changes by European institutions. 
Special Questions on Lending to Euro pean Firms and Their Affiliates and 
Subsidiaries  
A set of special questions asked respondents about lending to firms headquartered in 
Europe—both nonfinancial companies and banks, as well as their affiliates and subsidiaries.  
Only about 22 of the 57 domestic respondents indicated that they make loans or extend credit 
lines to European firms.  While only small net pe rcentages of domestic and foreign respondents 
indicated that their standards and terms on lo ans to European nonfinancial companies had 
tightened, a modest net fraction indicated that they had tightened their policies for lending to European banks.  Both domestic and foreign res pondents indicated, on net, almost no change in  
demand for loans from European firms or their aff iliates or subsidiaries.  However, modest net 
percentages of banks reported that the number of  inquiries regarding the availability of new or 
increased lines of credit from  such borrowers  had risen over the past three months. 
Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending 
In the July survey, most respondents reported  no change in their bank’s standards for 
approving commercial real estate loans.  The net percentage of banks that reported that their 
standards had tightened dropped slightly, to around 5 percent, and, as in the previous survey, only  
one respondent indicated having eased standards on CR E loans.  Overall, the net fraction of banks 
that reported that demand for CRE loans had decr eased continued to be small.  When broken out 
by bank size, however, large banks reported th at demand for CRE loans had increased for the 
second consecutive quarter, while other banks acc ounted for the reported reduction in loan 
demand. 
LENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS  
Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending 
On net, a small fraction of domestic ba nks reported having eased standards on prime 
residential mortgage loans.  The few banks that eased standards were all large banks.  
Collectively,  the banks that eased their standa rds on prime residential mortgages accounted for

consistent with the recent noticeable rise in appli cations to refinance mortgages, as reported by  
the Mortgage Bankers Association.4  
Fewer than one-half of survey responde
nts indicated that their bank originated 
nontraditional mortgage loans.  Of these responde nts, nearly all reported no change in their 
bank’s standards on such loans.  The small num ber of banks that reported an increase in demand 
for nontraditional mortgage loans balanced the number of banks that reported a decrease in 
demand.  However, this stability represented a noticeable change from th e April survey, when 
one-third of banks, on net, reported that demand for nontraditional mortgage loans had weakened. 
A small share of respondents reported that th eir bank’s standards for approving home 
equity lines of credit (HELOCs) had eased over the past three months.  But a similar fraction of 
respondents indicated that they had decreased the size of HELOCs for existing customers over the 
same period.  A small net percentage of banks reported that demand for HELOCs had weakened, 
on net, but that percentage was down sharply from last quarter. 
Questions on Consumer Lending 
The net percentage of respondents that reported an increased willingness to make 
consumer installment loans extended the upward tr end that it has exhibited in recent quarters, 
reaching the upper end of its range over the past decade.  This increased willingness is consistent 
with a net easing of standards for approving cons umer loans other than credit card loans and with 
moderate growth in nonrevolving loans at commercial banks over the past few months.  However, 
terms on consumer loans other than credit card lo ans were reported to be roughly unchanged, on  
net, in the July survey. 
Indicators of changes in standards and term s for approving applications for credit card 
loans were mixed.  A few banks reported having  eased standards, but small net fractions of 
respondents indicated that they had tightened terms and conditions on credit card accounts.  Moreover, a small fraction of banks, on  net, re ported having reduced the size of credit card lines 
for existing customers, though that fraction has d ecreased noticeably over the past few surveys.  
The easing of standards and terms on credit cards was accounted for by large banks, while the  
reported tightening occurred at other banks. 
On balance, a small percenta ge of respondents indicated that demand for consumer loans 
had weakened.  A modest net percentage of la rge banks reported an increase in demand for the 
second consecutive quarter, but a slightly larger ne t percentage of other banks reported a decrease 
in such demand.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS   
The risks to the outlook are substantial,  as indicated by the sizable confidence 
intervals around our projections  of real activity and infla tion (whether based on FRB/US 
stochastic simulations or the staff’s historical  forecast errors).  To illustrate some of these 
risks, we consider a number of alternatives to the baseline projecti on using simulations of 
staff models.  In the first scenario, we assume  that the disappointing tone of a wide range 
of recent indicators is signaling a much more sluggish recovery this year and next than 
we have built into the baseline.  The second scen ario also explores the risk of weaker real 
activity, fueled in this case by less favorable supply-side conditions that imply lower 
permanent income.  In contrast, the third scenar io considers the possibility that the recent 
softness in the data is simply noise, which is masking building momentum that will lead to a more robust recovery than in the baseli ne.  We then turn to opposing risks to the 
inflation outlook—either that inflation will come in noticeably higher than we project, as 
many private forecasters expect, or that we will experience the more pronounced 
disinflation predicted by so me of the staff’s reduced-f orm models.  The final two 
scenarios consider risks arising from the forei gn sector:  first, that Europe will dip back  
into recession, and second, that the depreciati on of the dollar will be more rapid than in 
the baseline.   
In these scenarios, the federal funds rate  responds to movements in real activity 
and inflation as prescribed by a simple policy rule.  We generate most of the scenarios 
using the FRB/US model and the same policy rule for the federal funds rate as that 
detailed in the long-term outlook discussi on in the “Domestic Economic Developments 
and Outlook” section, with nontraditional polic y assumed to follow the baseline path.  
The last two scenarios, however, are gene rated using the multicountry SIGMA model, 
which uses a somewhat different policy rule  that employs an a lternative concept of 
resource utilization.

model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment in wages and 
prices.

Weaker Recovery  
The surprisingly weak tone of recent da ta suggests that the recovery may be 
having difficulty gaining tracti on.  Indeed, some statistical models predict that, based on 
the incoming data, the increase in real GDP w ill fall noticeably short of 2 percent in the 
second half of this year.  In this scenario, we assume that  the near-term improvements in 
the labor market, confidence, and credit conditions underlying our baseline projection are 
slow to materialize, leadi ng households and firms to hold back on spending through next 
year.  In addition, the sluggish pace of recovery leads to a reassessm ent of the outlook for 
earnings and the riskiness of equity holdi ngs, causing equity pr ices to fall about 
10 percent relative to the baseline by next year, which furthe r depresses spending.  In this 
environment, real GDP expands at an aver age annual rate of only 1½ percent until mid-
2011.  In turn, labor market conditions sta gnate, and the unemployment rate remains 
above 9½ percent until the end of next year.  Inflation, however, is li ttle affected because 
less capital spending holds down productivity and boosts unit labor costs relative to 
baseline, largely offsetting the disinflationary effects of greater slack.  With these weaker 
conditions, lift-off of the federal funds rate from its effective lower bound is delayed until 
mid-2013.  This additional monetary stimulus, t ogether with an assume d gradual return of 
spending to long-run fundamentals, causes real  GDP to expand more rapidly than in the 
baseline starting in 2013.  
Lower Potential   
The pace of the recovery could also turn out to be slower than expected if we have 
overestimated the economy’s pr oductive potential, gi ven that less favor able supply-side 
conditions would imply lower long-run levels  of real household income and corporate 
earnings.  Although the NAIRU and potential output are always difficult to measure, this 
risk seems more elevated than usual in light  of the extremely high level of long-duration 
unemployment, as well as the diffi culty of gauging the longer-run economic 
consequences of the unprecedented disturbances to the financial system.  Indeed, some  
outside forecasters have noticeably lower estimat es of slack.  In this  scenario, we assume 
that output is currently 4 percent below pot ential rather than the baseline estimate of 
7¾ percent, reflecting both a higher NAIRU and a lower level of structural productivity.  
The lower long-run levels of household inco me and corporate earnings implied by this 
assumption, and their effects on consumption and investment, cause real GDP to expand 
1 percentage point less per year, on average,  through 2014 than in the baseline, and the 
unemployment rate to decline more slowl y.  In addition, pric es accelerate more 
noticeably:  Core PCE infla tion rises to 1½ percent in 2011 and to almost 2 percent by

2014, reflecting both the direct effects of lower productivity on marginal cost and a 
smaller margin of slack.  Policymakers grad ually take on board th e evidence of less-
favorable supply-side conditions, and in response to less slack and higher inflation, 
monetary policy begins tightening in the middle of next year.   
Virtuous Circle 
Although we have marked down the forecast in response to incoming data, such 
indicators are inherently noi sy and could be misleading us.  Moreover, we may have 
understated the degree to which a resumption of spending delayed during the recession, 
improving financial conditions, and a recove ring labor market will generate a rapid 
rebound in activity.  In light of this possibi lity, this scenario examines a stronger 
bounceback in spending on consumer durables a nd an even more marked acceleration in 
capital expenditure, reflecting a mutually reinforcing cycle of improved optimism, higher 
spending, greater hiring, and increasing credit availability.  The strong activity in turn reinforces optimism in financial markets, a nd equity prices are 12 percent above baseline 
by the end of next year; financial conditi ons improve further into 2012.  The virtuous 
circle causes real GDP to expand 5¼ per cent, on average, in 2011 and 2012, thereby 
pushing the unemployment rate down to 8½ perc ent by the end of next  year and to the 
NAIRU by 2013.  With less slack, inflation is higher; however, the upward pressure is 
partially checked by more capital deepening and thus larger productivity gains.  Under 
these conditions, the federal funds rate begi ns to rise in early 2012 and remains above 
baseline thereafter. 
Higher Inflation  
Many outside forecasters anticipate higher inflation than in the staff projection 
despite similar or more pessimistic outlooks for the real economy.  The “Lower Potential” scenario described one set of factor s that could lead to hi gher inflation than in 
the staff’s projection; here we consider other possibilities.  One risk is that we may have 
taken too much signal from the low infla tion figures so far this year, with the 
consequence that the decelera tion in underlying inflation coul d be more modest than we 
have implicitly assumed.  Another possibility is that the acceleration in activity to above-
trend growth will place more upward pressure on inflation than we expect through “speed 
effects,” with commodity and other prices reacting to the rate  of change in activity.  In 
this scenario, inflation follows a path cons istent with outside forecasters’ consensus, 
which we read as anticipating core PCE infla tion of about 1½ percent next year.  In the 
face of this higher inflation, th e policy rule prescribes ra ising the federal funds rate

starting in late 2011, about a year earlier than in the baseline and closer to the interest rate 
projections of some outside forecasters.  Th e tighter monetary policy tempers aggregate 
demand, so real GDP expands somewhat more slowly than in the baseline. 
Greater Disinflation 
In the baseline, inflation remains relativ ely stable through ne xt year and then 
begins to rise as unemployment declines in  an environment of well-anchored inflation  
expectations.  But inflation expectations c ould prove less stable than we expect given 
persistent weakness in labor and product markets and ongoing  low inflation.  In this 
scenario, both expected and actual inflation fall significan tly, by magnitudes that are 
roughly in line with the pred ictions of many reduced-form  forecasting equations.  As a 
result, inflation runs around zero from 2011 through 2014, causing the federal funds rate 
to remain near zero until the end of 2013.  The more accommodative monetary policy 
eventually stimulates aggregate spending, a nd real GDP expands faster than in the 
baseline during 2013 and 2014. 
Double-Dip Recession in Europe 
In the baseline, we project that the Eur opean economies continue to recover next 
year as financial stress eases and sentiment im proves.  In this scenario, we assume that 
financial stress remains elevated and consum er confidence deteriorates.  Specifically,  
sovereign and corporate debt spreads in Europe rise 50 and 100 basis points above 
baseline, respectively, and the trade-weighted euro depreciates about 10 percent relative 
to baseline.  In response, European GDP contracts ¾ percent in 2011 and is 3 percent 
below baseline by the end of that year—a reduction in activity in line with the 
assumptions embedded in the EU’s recent ba nk stress tests (see the box on the EU-wide 
stress-test exercise in the “International Economic Developm ents and Outlook” section).  
U.S. real net exports decline because of  both a stronger dollar and weaker foreign 
activity.  On net, this mild European recessi on leaves U.S. real GDP growth ½ percentage 
point below baseline in 2011.   U.S. core PCE inflation is ¼ percentage point below 
baseline in 2011, reflecting both lower import prices and greater resource slack.  The 
lower inflation and greater slack imply a federa l funds rate that runs a bit below baseline 
after mid-2012.  U.S. real GDP growth is  slightly above baseline in 2012 and 2013 
because of greater monetary accommodation and a gradual improvement in European 
conditions.

Dollar Depreciation 
A sizable dollar decline could be spurred by a broad range of global 
developments, including faster-than-expected foreign growth, a more rapid tightening of 
monetary policy abroad than projected, or an en hanced risk appetite for foreign assets.   
In this scenario, the broad real dollar deprecia tes 10 percent below baseline by mid-2011 
because of a lower risk premium that incr eases the relative attractiveness of foreign 
assets.  As a result, U.S. exports become more competitive, and U.S. consumers 
substitute away from imports toward domestically produced goods.  Relative to baseline, 
U.S. real GDP rises ¾ percentage point faster  in 2011.  Core PCE pri ce inflation rises in 
response to higher import pri ces and greater resource utiliz ation and is ½ percentage 
point above baseline in 2011.  The nominal  trade balance improves 1¼ percent of GDP 
by the end of 2011.  Starting in 2012, the federa l funds rate is somewhat higher than in 
the baseline, and, as a result, real GDP growth is somewhat lower in 2013 and 2014. 
OUTSIDE FORECASTS  
The Blue Chip consensus forecast rel eased in early July shows real GDP 
advancing about 2¾ percent in the second half of 2010 and 3 percent in 2011, a bit 
slower than anticipated in the June survey.  (These projections were made prior to the 
annual revision to the NIPA that was released in late July.)  Compared with the staff 
forecast, the consensus projection for real GDP growth is a bit stronger in the second half 
of this year but notably weaker in 2011; indeed, by the end of 2011, the staff forecast for 
real GDP growth is similar to that of th e 10 Blue Chip responde nts with the highest 
forecasts of real activity.  Regarding in flation, the consensus forecast shows the CPI 
increasing 1.7 percent in 2011, 0.2 percentage point less than the consensus projection 
made a month earlier.  Nonetheless, private forecasts for CPI inflation are, on average, 
notably above the staff forecast of 1.1 percent, and the staff inflation outlook is similar to 
that held by the 10 Blue Chip respondents with  the lowest forecasts for inflation.  Staff 
assumptions for interest rates are below those of the Blue Chip consensus.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
NAIRU. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The annual FI estimates are on a calendar year basis. Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.
