Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received since the time of the Augus t projection points 
to a more sluggish pace of expansion in econom ic activity than we previously projected.  
Although consumer spending has been a bit fi rmer than we had expected, most other 
indicators have been disappointing.  In the hous ing sector, both sales and starts in July 
were considerably weaker than we had anti cipated, providing furt her evidence that a 
meaningful recovery in the housing market has yet to get under way.  Indicators of 
business spending have also come in on the lo w side of our expect ations, with both the 
data on orders and shipments of capital goods and readings from surveys of business 
sentiment suggesting a weaker s econd half of the year than we had been projecting.  In 
addition, the anemic pace of employment growth this summer, along with the still 
elevated level of initial claims, led us to mark down the projected pace of job growth 
through the end of this year.  All told, we now project that real GDP will rise at an annual 
rate of 2 percent in the sec ond half of this year—½ percentage point lower than we 
projected in August. 
In addition to the weaker incoming data, the conditioning assumptions in this 
projection have become somewhat less favorable than they were at the time of the August 
Tealbook.  Equity prices have moved a bit lo wer, foreign growth is expected to be 
weaker, and the projected path of the dollar is  a little higher.  We also revised down our 
projection for the change in house prices, a reflection of the disappointing news on 
housing activity and foreclosure volumes.  The combina tion of these less supportive 
conditioning assumptions and the weaker inco ming data has led us to lower our medium-
term projection as well.  
In particular, we now project that re al GDP will increase 3¼ percent in 2011, 
about ¼ percentage point less th an in the last forecast.  Fo r 2012, which we just added to 
the medium-term projection, we expect real GDP  growth to step up to about 4½ percent.  
Even with these gains, the economic r ecovery makes only limited progress in 
reemploying productive resources that are currently idle; th e unemployment rate falls 
only gradually from 9¾ percent at the end of this year to  8 percent at the end of 2012. 
Our projection for inflation is little ch anged from the last Tealbook.  Although we 
marked down our outlook for economic activity, we also raised our estimate of the

Tealbook.  We project that core  PCE inflation will slow from 1.1 percent this year to 
0.9 percent next year, unchanged from the A ugust forecast.  For 2012, we expect core 
inflation to remain at 0.9 percent.  With energy prices expected to rise a bit faster than 
core, we expect overall consumer price inflation to be 1.1 percent in 2011 and 1 percent in 2012.  
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
As in the August Tealbook, we assume that  the FOMC will hold the target federal 
funds rate in the current range of 0 to ¼ pe rcent until the fourth quarter of 2012.  In this 
forecast, we have incorporated the FOMC’s decision to reinvest principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities by purchasing longer-term Treasury 
securities.  This change in policy has the eff ect of keeping constant the projected size of 
the Federal Reserve’s securitie s holdings over the next few years, an action that we 
estimate shaves roughly 10 basis points off th e level of the 10-year Treasury yield over 
the medium term relative to  the August projection.  
Financial Conditions 
The 10-year Treasury yield has decreased since the time of the August Tealbook, 
and we have lowered slightly the projected path of the 10-year Treasury yield in this 
forecast.  Nonetheless, as in the previous forecast, we anticipate that the Treasury yield will rise gradually, but significantly, from its current level of about 2¾ percent to about 
4¼ percent by the end of 2012.  Several fact ors underlie this pr ojected contour, but, 
quantitatively, the most important is the movement of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of near-zero short-term interest rates. 
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  have decreased slightly in recent 
weeks, and their spreads to comparable-m aturity Treasury yields  have inched up.  
Meanwhile, conforming fixed mortgage rates ha ve edged down a bit less than Treasury 
yields since early August, leav ing their spreads a shade highe r.  Given these relatively 
small changes, the projected paths for corpor ate bond yields and mort gage rates are only 
a touch lower than in the August Tealbook.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookThe Dow Jones U.S. Stock Market Index is  on track to end the current quarter a 
bit below the level anticipa ted in the August Tealbook, and, in light of the weaker 
economic outlook, we have trimmed the projected  rate of appreciati on expected over the 
medium term, leaving the level of stock prices down 3½ percent by the end of 2011.  
Nonetheless, with the equity premium re maining well above longer-run norms, we 
continue to expect stock prices to increase ma rkedly over the next c ouple of years—at an 
average annual rate of about  13 percent—to bring the implied premium down toward a 
more typical level. 
For house prices, the CoreLogic repeat  sales index (formerly known as the 
LoanPerformance index) was firmer than we expected in the second quarter, but it 
decreased noticeably in July.  More importa ntly, a broad range of  indicators—including 
home sales and foreclosure volumes—suggest a weaker housing market than we had 
anticipated and portend additional softness in home prices in coming quarters.  We now 
expect house prices to post small declines th rough the middle of next year and then to 
turn up gradually thereafter; all told, we shaved about 2 percent from the level of prices at 
the end of 2011. 
Fiscal Policy 
Fiscal policy is expected to provide a touch more impetus to aggregate demand 
than we anticipated in the August forecast.  In  particular, in response to recent legislation, 
we have raised federal grants-in-aid to state and local governments in 2011 by 
$26 billion.  Our assumptions for other fede ral policies are unchanged, including our 
expectations that most provisions of th e 2001–03 and ARRA tax cuts will be extended 
and that the EUC program will be wi nding down over 2011 and 2012.  All told, we 
expect that discretionary federal fiscal policy actions will provide a small direct boost to 
the increase in aggregate demand in the second ha lf of this year, but that they will then 
impose a drag in 2011 and 2012.  
Our forecast for the unified federal budget is roughly the same as in the August 
Tealbook, with the deficit expected to be a bout $1.3 trillion in bot h fiscal 2010 and 2011 
(around 9 percent of GDP in both years).  Th e deficit is projected to narrow to about 
$1 trillion in fiscal 2012 (around 7 percent of  GDP), primarily reflecting the budgetary 
effects of the continuing economic recove ry and the winding down of stimulus-related 
spending.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookThe Foreign Outlook and the Dollar  
Although data for foreign economic activity in the second quarter surprised us on 
the upside, more recent indicators have, on bala nce, been weaker than we had expected.  
The softer foreign data, along with the downwar d revision to the projected path of U.S. 
GDP growth, led us to mark down the outlook for foreign real GDP growth by 
½ percentage point in the sec ond half of this year and by ¼ percentage point in 2011.  We 
now project that foreign GDP growth will slow from an annual rate of 5½ percent in the 
first half of this year to 2¾  percent in the second half, as the boost from the recovery in 
global trade, manufacturing, and inventories wanes.  Thereafte r, we expect that foreign 
growth will pick up to roughly a 3½ percent pace  as a gradual revival in private spending 
more than offsets a withdrawal of policy stimulus. 
Since the August forecast, the dollar has a ppreciated slightly on a trade-weighted 
basis against a broad set of currencies.  We are assuming a moderate trend rate of 
depreciation of the real dolla r in 2011 and 2012 of about 3 per cent per year.  This rate of 
depreciation is slightly smaller than we ha d assumed in August, as we now see China and 
other emerging market economies allowing their currencies to rise more slowly against 
the dollar in light of the softer outlook fo r economic growth.  Our forecast leaves the 
broad real dollar 1¼ percent higher than in the August Tealbook at the end of 2011. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices  
After rising to more than $80 per barrel just prior to the close of the August 
Tealbook, oil prices have since declined, on net, consistent with a weaker outlook for 
global economic activity.  The s pot price of West Texas Inte rmediate (WTI) oil has fallen 
about $6 per barrel relative to the August projection, closing most recently on 
September 14 at $77—well within the $70 to $80 per barrel range that has largely 
prevailed in recent months.  Prices of futures contracts dated for delivery further out have 
also declined, but by lesser amounts.  Cons istent with these fu tures prices, we now 
project that the spot price of  WTI will rise to $84 per barrel by the end of 2011, nearly 
$4 lower than in our previous forecast, and to $86 per barrel by the end of 2012. 
In contrast to oil prices, prices of many other commodities have either moved 
higher or changed little sin ce the August Tealbook, and we estimate that our index of 
nonfuel commodity prices will have risen 6¾ perc ent at an annual rate this quarter.  Food 
prices, especially prices for corn and wheat , have continued to increase because of 
concerns about foreign crop conditions; howev er, those prices remain well below the 
   
    
                                                 
1 With the annual revision of the NIPA released in July, the BEA revised its seasonal adjustment 
procedure for oil imports in such a way as to create an unusual surge in real oil imports in the second and 
third quarters, and a corresponding d ecline in the first and fourth quarters.  In the past, problems with 
seasonal adjustments seem not to have fully shown through to top-line GDP estimates, so we have offset about one-half of the expected effect in the third and fo urth quarters of this year by adjusting our projection 
for inventory investment.  Of course, the entire effect could show through this time; in that case, the growth 
rate of real GDP would be lower than we are projec ting for the third quarter and higher for the fourth.

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookpeaks reached in early 2008, as global inventories are much hi gher than they were then.  
In addition, prices for metals have recove red from a mid-August decline, and futures 
prices now trace a path slightly above that projected in the August Tealbook.  Taken 
together, we see nonfuel commodity prices increa sing at an 11 percent rate in the fourth 
quarter, an upward revision of more th an 5 percentage points.  For 2011 and 2012, 
consistent with quotes from futures markets,  we project nonfuel commodity prices to 
remain about flat at a level around 3 percen t higher than in the previous Tealbook.  
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
The data on domestic economic activity that  we have received since the time of 
the August forecast have been weaker than expected on balance.  The BEA revised down 
its estimate of the increase in real GDP for the second quarter by ½ percentage point, to 
an annual rate of just 1½ percent; employment gains in recent months have been 
disappointing; and, while consumer spending app ears to be a touch stronger than we had 
expected, business and residential investment  appear weaker.  In response, we have 
marked down our forecast for real GDP growth over the second half of the year to an 
annual rate of 2 percent, ½ percentage point lower than in the August Tealbook.1
Labor Markets 
The improvement in the labor market c ontinues to be quite sluggish.  Private 
employment rose just 67,000 in August, leav ing the level of private employment in 
August about 50,000 lower than in the last T ealbook projection.  Over the three months 
ending in August, private employers added roughly 80,000 workers per month, about half 
of the pace recorded over the preceding three months.  Meanwhile, the average 
workweek for all employees moved side ways on balance over this period. 
In addition, other labor market indica tors, including in itial claims for 
unemployment insurance, suggest that the p ace of layoffs has increased a bit in recent

 1 The Markov-switching models produce probabilities that the economy is in a low-growth state, which do not 
always coincide exactly with NBER-dated recessions.  Howe ver, for short, we refer to the probabilities generated 
by these models as recession probabilities.  For more de tails on the models using GDP and GDI, see Jeremy 
Nalewaik (2007), “Estimating Probabilities of Recession in Real Time Using GDP and GDI,” Finance and 
Economics Discussion Series 2007-07 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).

production, and forecasts of sales and income variables.

Page 8 of 104   How Likely Is a Double Dip?
The recent weakness in a range of economic 
indicators has raised concerns about the possibility 
of a double-dip recession.  Anticipating a turning 
point in real activity in real time is notoriously difficult, but these difficulties notwithstanding, 
here we consider results from a range of models 
that generate recession probabilities. 
To begin, we examine the probability that the economy has already fallen into recession, using 
several Markov-switching models that we regularly 
track.
1  The figure below shows probabilities from 
three models:  one using percent changes in real GDP as the model input, one using percent changes 
in both real GDP and real GDI, and one using the 
four monthly indicators highlighted by the NBER 
Business Cycle Dating Committee—payroll 
employment, real personal income net of transfers, industrial production, and manufacturing and trade 
sales.  As can be seen in the figure, probabilities 
from the models line up well with the historical 
NBER recession dates, and the model using both GDP and GDI often has signaled the onset of recessionary periods before the other two models. 
As shown in the table (see bottom of next page) and figure, all three models agree that the 
probability that the economy is in recession has 
risen recently but is still relatively low.  
Conditional on the Teal book forecast for the 
current quarter, the model using GDP shows a probability of 12 percent in 2010:Q3, up from 
5 percent in 2010:Q1, while the model using GDP 
and GDI shows a probability of 18 percent in 
2010:Q3, up from 2 percent in 2010:Q1.  The 
probability from the monthly indicators model, 
using information through August, has also ticked 
up a little after running at 0 percent earlier in the 
year.
2
What about the likelihood that the economy will 
fall into recession in the near future?  The 
probabilities from the Markov-switching models 
likely are an encouraging signal in this regard

 3Although the stochastic simulations suggest that the probability of two consecutive negative quarters is relatively 
low, the probability of a single quarter of contraction is noticeably higher, registering around 30 percent back in 
March and almost 50 percent now.  The consensus in the most recent Blue Chip survey places the odds of at least 
one quarter of contraction over the coming year at around 25 percent.

Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2007-57 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).

because of the strong historical tendency for  expansions to persist, absent major shocks.  Another 
way to look ahead is with stochastic simulations 
around the Tealbook projection, using forecast 
errors fro m prior Greenbook s and Tealbooks.  Given 
the baseline projection, the historical forecast errors 
 imply a 13 percent probability that real GDP will 
decline for two consecutive quarters between 
2010:Q3 and 2011:Q2.  While this probability is 
still low, it has risen from 6 percent in March.3
Other models rely on financial indicators to forecast recessions, and at the moment place fairly low odds 
on the likelihood of a double dip.  For example, a 
model using the slope of the yield curve and a 
corporate bond spread has, since the middle of last 
year, been showing a clos e-to-zero probability of 
recession one-year ahead.
4   However, given the 
extraordinary circumstances prevailing in financial 
markets in recent years, including the binding zero 
lower bound, the usefulness of these financial 
variables for forecasting a recession may be 
somewhat diminished currently. The accumulation of evid ence in recent months—
as seen through the filter of the models just 
described—does not suggest that a double-dip  
recession is imminent.  However, the models have their limitations.  As noted, the Markov-switching 
models exploit the tendency for expansions to 
persist, but the forces that have driven that 
persistence over history may be less relevant now 
than in the past.  And the factors that are currently 
raising recession fears, including concerns about 
household and business confidence, may not be 
well captured by these models.  Finally, in the 
current environment, fiscal and monetary policy 
may be more limited than usual in their ability to 
respond to adverse shocks, perhaps leaving the 
economy more vulnerable than suggested by 
historical relationships.  Overall, we judge that the 
risk of recession or persistent slow growth is likely 
higher than suggested by these models.

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookmonths, while indicators of hiring remain quite soft.  Along with the deterioration in the 
near-term GDP outlook, these discouraging labor market readings  have caused us to mark 
down our forecast of the gain in private employment to an average of 90,000 per month for the rest of the year, about half the pace projected in the August Tealbook.  Consistent with this anemic rate of job growth, we e xpect the unemployment rate to edge up from 
9.6 percent in August to 9.7 percent in the fourth quarter.  
The Industrial Sector 
The rise in industrial pro duction (IP) moderated, on net, in recent months, and is 
expected to slow further over the remainder of  the year.  Manufactur ing IP in the current 
quarter has been supported by a step-up in motor vehicle assemblies, as automakers 
replenished lean dealer stocks.  However, schedules suggest th at automakers plan to pare 
back production next quarter, and we expect mo tor vehicle output to be a drag on IP in 
the fourth quarter.  
Elsewhere in manufacturing, output gains have slowed from their robust pace 
earlier in the year, as the impetus to produc tion from inventory rebuilding has diminished 
and the recovery in domestic demand for domestically produced goods has remained 
lackluster.  Moreover, with th e most recent indicators of ne ar-term manufacturing activity 
having softened, we expect only modest gain s in production in coming months.  All told, 
we now project that manufacturing output wi ll increase at an a nnual rate of about 
2 percent in the second half of  this year, down from about 7 percent in the first half. 
Household Spending 
Real PCE rose 0.2 percent in July, sim ilar to the average gain over the two 
preceding months, and based on data for retail sales and light motor vehicles, we project 
a gain of 0.3 percent in August.  Although our current estimate for August is higher than 
in the previous Tealbook, the data on spe nding are still broadly consistent with the 
overall weakness in the key determinants of  consumption.  In particular, gains in 
employment have been sluggish, wage increases  have been small, and households likely 
have continued to make spending adjustments in  response to the large declines in wealth 
over the past few years.  Moreover, consumer sentiment has remained at a depressed level, as many households appear anxious about  their future income prospects.  Given 
these factors, we continue to project that re al PCE will rise at an  annual rate of about

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook2 percent over the second half of  this year, a pace close to that  recorded in the first half of 
the year.  
 Housing demand has dropped to exceptionally weak levels since the April 
signing deadline for th e homebuyer tax credit.2  Existing home sales plunged 30 percent 
between April and July, and new home sales have hovered at record lows since May.  As 
for construction activity, single-family starts  from May to July were about15 percent 
below the average level over the preceding three months, and the July reading for 
adjusted permit issuance suggests more of the same in August.   
These incoming data were considerably weak er than we expected and suggest that 
the tax credit pulled forward more sales than we anticipated and that the payback will be 
more concentrated in the third quarter th an we had assumed.  Even after making 
allowances for those larger tax credit effect s, we continue to be surprised by the 
weakness in home sales in this environment of low mortgage rates and housing prices 
that are both low and apparently leveling out.  This unexpected weakness in housing 
demand may reflect a number of influences , including the drag on household formation 
from economic uncertainty and anemic job creation, persistent concerns about potential further house price declines, and continued co nstraints on the ability of some households 
to obtain mortgage credit.  We now expect little material improvement in the underlying 
pace of housing activity until next year.   
Business Investment 
After surging over the past three quarters, real E&S spending is expected to 
decelerate markedly in the second half of this year.  In part, the st ep-down reflects a sharp 
dropback in business outlays for motor vehicl es following an exceptionally rapid increase 
in these purchases over the first half of  the year.  But E&S spending outside of 
transportation is projected to decelerate as well. 
We expect that slowdown to be grea ter than in the A ugust Tealbook, as the 
incoming data have been softer than we e xpected.  The BEA’s preliminary estimate of 
software spending in the second quarter wa s below our expectations, and in July, 
   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
September 15, 2010
Page 13 of 104
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookshipments of nondefense capital goods exclud ing aircraft declined more than we 
anticipated.  Moreover, orders dropped sh arply in July and now stand a bit below 
shipments.  The latest readings on busine ss sentiment have also softened some, but 
analysts’ expectations for the earnings of capital goods produ cers remain consistent with 
robust investment growth and most an ecdotal reports from major equipment 
manufacturers are still relatively upbeat.  We now project that overall E&S will increase 
at an annual rate of just 2 percent in the s econd half of the year; excluding transportation, 
E&S is expected to increase at an annual rate of about 5 percent rate over this time 
period—still relatively solid, but about 3 perc entage points below our previous forecast. 
Investment in nonresidential structures has drifted lower of late , as increases in 
spending on drilling and mining structures have been more than offset by declines in 
building construction.  Looking ahead, energy pr ices appear high enough to sustain solid 
increases in drilling and mining expenditures over the second half of  this year.  In 
contrast, while the downtrend in construction outlays on buildings appears to have slowed somewhat, the overhang of unoccupied space and tight lending conditions continue to weigh on this sect or.  We look for a moderate decline in outlays on building 
construction over the second half of 2010. 
 Real inventory investment rose furthe r in the second quarter and the latest book-
value data point to a jump in stockbuildi ng by manufacturers and w holesalers in July.  
Nevertheless, business inventories overall do not  appear excessive:  Inventory-sales ratios 
in most sectors remain well below their recen t peaks, and according to the survey data, 
most businesses do not perceive an overaccumu lation.  In the motor vehicle sector, after 
having been rebuilt through August, dealer inventories are proj ected to change little, on 
balance, through the end of the year.  Outside of motor vehi cles, we expect stockbuilding 
to continue at a relatively steady pace over th e remainder of the year as firms boost their 
inventories in line with sales growth.  For the second half of the year as a whole, 
inventory investment is projec ted to contribute little to the rate of change of real GDP.  
Government 
In the government sector, we expect real federal purchas es to rise at an annual 
rate of 4 percent in the second ha lf of this year, a pace that is just a bit slower than in the 
first half.  Defense spending is expected to post robust increases, while nondefense 
spending is expected to edge dow n as temporary Census workers are laid off.  In the state 
and local sector, employment fell 14,000 per mo nth, on average, in July and August,

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookabout the same pace of job lo ss as that recorded over the first half of the year, and 
nominal construction outlays in July were about  flat.  We expect hiring to continue to 
decline slowly over the remainder of the year , and construction spendi ng to pick up just a 
bit.  All told, we expect real state and lo cal purchases to edge down ½ percent at an 
annual rate over the second half of the year. 
Foreign Trade  
Following a remarkable 33 percent surge in  the second quarter, real imports of 
goods and services are expected to edge up at  an annual rate of only 4 percent in the 
second half of the year.  Th e exceptional strength of imports in the second quarter far 
outstripped the expansion in domestic demand.  Although a sharp increase in real oil 
imports, in part driven by an odd seasonal ad justment pattern, contri buted importantly to 
the second quarter increase, non-oil imports we re also very robust.  We expect import 
growth going forward to fall back to a rate more in line with that of U.S. activity—a 
projection broadly supported by a decline in imports in the m onthly trade data for July.  
Of note, real oil imports are projected to fall in the second half, reflecting the unwinding 
of the aforementioned seasonal pattern.  In cont rast, real exports are expected to increase 
at an annual rate of 9½ percen t in the second half of the y ear—similar to their first-half 
pace—reflecting our projection of continued moderate foreign GDP growth and a 
continuation of the cycl ical rebound in trade. 
After subtracting close to 3½ percentage points from the change in real GDP in 
the second quarter, including a negative contri bution of over 1 percentage point from real 
oil imports alone, we expect net exports to make a positive contribution of about 
½ percentage point on average in the second half  of the year.  This contribution is similar 
to that in the previous Tealbook. 
Prices and Wages 
Core PCE price inflation slowed from 1¾ percent over the four quarters of 2009 
to an annual rate of just a little over 1 percent over  the first half of this year, and we 
expect it to remain at about that slower pace in the second half.  Core goods prices 
decreased at an annual rate of about 1 percent in the first ha lf of 2010, and we project that 
these prices will decline furthe r on average in the second half of this year.  The index for 
housing services has turned up in recent mont hs, but the pace of price increases for other 
core services has moderated somewhat.  On balance, we now expect the price index for 
   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
September 15, 2010
Page 16 of 104
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlooknon-energy services to rise in th e second half of this year at about the same modest pace 
as in the first half.   
The July reading on core consumer price inflation was slightly higher than 
expected, and we took some signal from the su rprises in the more persistent components 
of the index—including the rent indexes.  As a result, our current projection for core 
inflation in the second half of 2010 is a couple of tenths above our fo recast in the August 
Tealbook.  
Total PCE prices increased, on average, at about the same rate as core PCE prices 
in the first half of this year, as the run-up in energy prices in  the first quarter was reversed 
in the second.  For the remainder of the year , we expect PCE energy prices to post only 
modest increases and total PCE prices to increas e at a rate very close to that of core PCE 
prices.  
The incoming data on labor compensation continue to be subdued.  Compensation 
per hour in the nonfarm business sector was revi sed down sharply in the first half of the 
year, largely reflecting the incorporation of more complete earnings data from 
unemployment insurance records for the first quarter.  We now estimate that 
compensation per hour declined at an annual rate  of about ¾ percent in  the first half of 
2010, following a 2½ percent increase in 2009.  More-recent data suggest a pickup in 
labor compensation, with average hourly earn ings rising about ¼ percent per month in 
July and August, and we expect compensation per hour will increase at an annual rate of 
about 2 percent in the sec ond half of this year.   
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
The weaker-than-expected incoming da ta suggest that underlying demand is 
softer than we had thought.  In additi on, financial conditions are somewhat less 
supportive of economic growth th an at the time of the August Tealbook.  As a result, we 
have marked down our projection for real GDP  growth in 2011 to 3¼ percent, about ¼ 
percentage point slower than in the August Tealbook.  We project real GDP growth to 
pick up to 4½ percent in 2012.  
The basic dynamics of the recovery are the same as in previous forecasts.  
Although the impetus from federal fiscal policy wanes, private demand is expected to be 
supported by a continued increase in credit availability and a reduction in the adverse

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookeffects of earlier declines in wealth.  At the same time, business and household 
confidence is anticipated to improve and a mo re pronounced recovery in the labor market 
to take hold.  Of course, the timing and magnitu de of this “virtuous circle” are difficult to 
predict, but we believe th at we have taken a reasona ble middle ground between an 
economy that accelerates quick ly as pent-up demand is unleashed and one in which 
consumers and businesses remain extremely cautious for an extended period.   
In the household sector, for example, we e xpect that the support to spending from 
pent-up demand and more favorable credit conditions will be moderated by ongoing 
efforts of households to shor e up their balance sheets and by th e slow pace of job creation 
and continued concerns about future income prospects.  As a result, we project real 
consumption spending to rise 3 percent in  2011, roughly in line w ith the increase in 
income and consistent with a saving rate that is about flat at close to 5½ percent.  By 
2012, however, we expect that consumer confidence about the recovery will have solidified, and our projection calls for real PCE to accelerate to more than 4 percent 
growth and for the saving rate to edge down. 
Similarly, by the middle of 2011, we expect housing activity to be rising steadily, 
supported by the boost to affordability from low mortgage rates and low house prices, 
increasing confidence that hous e prices have bottomed out, and improvements in income 
and employment.  However, at 600,000 units and 880,000 units for 2011 and 2012, respectively, our projection for single-family housing starts is still far below the pace we 
believe is consistent with the longer-run de mand for housing.  This shortfall reflects, in 
large part, the substantial overhang of vacant homes and lingering impediments to the 
availability of mortgage credit.   
Our projection calls for real E&S spending to increase about 10 percent per year 
in both 2011 and 2012, consistent with the rela tively slow growth environment that we 
are projecting to prevail over the next couple of  years.  The resulting level of investment 
is only a bit higher than that required to replace the depreciating stock, leaving the growth 
rate of the capital stock quite low for an economic recovery.  (See the box on the 
recovery in equipment and soft ware for further discussion.) 
The overall pace of the recovery in ou r projection is also held down by our 
expectation that some sectors will experi ence an especially protracted period of 
weakness.  For example, investment in nonresid ential structures is projected to continue

  How Much Progress Have Households Made  in Repairing Their Balance Sheets?
Sharp reductions in employment, income, and 
wealth left many households with a need to repair 
severely distressed balance sheets.  Aggregate 
 data suggest that progress has been made in this regard.  However, a significant number of 
 households continue to face financial strains that run deeper than the aggregate data suggest, and, 
for them, the financial repair process could take 
considerable time to completely play out.  
After having reached an al l-time high in the third 
quarter of 2007, the aggregate ratio of household debt to disposable personal income (shown in the 
figure below) declined noticeably through the 
second quarter of 2010.  This decrease reflects 
reduced borrowing by households, repayments of 
a portion of existing debt, and defaults on some 
obligations, as well as a modest rise in disposable income.  Over the same period, the household 
debt service ratio (D SR)—defined as the  
minimum payments to cover principal and interest on household debt as a fraction of 
disposable income—has decreased more 
noticeably, as the average interest rates paid on 
debt have moved down on net (figure on facing 
page).  The DSR currently stands at a level last 
seen in 2000. 
Measures of household credit quality have also 
showed some signs of improvement in recent 
months.  Delinquency rates have fallen 
noticeably from their recession peaks, although 
they remain at unusually high levels.  The extent 
of improvement is not uniform, however, as 
delinquency rates on mortgages have moved 
down less than rates on consumer credit, a 
 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
September 15, 2010
Page 21 of 104 
pattern that likely reflects the persistence of 
widespread negative home equity.  (See the 
exhibit on household finances in the “Financial 
Developments” section for further details.) 
Meanwhile, in recent quarters, household assets have risen, on net, reflecting increases in equity 
prices, a leveling-off of home prices, and a higher 
personal saving rate than in the years before the 
crisis.  At the end of the third quarter, the ratio of 
household net worth—the difference between 
household assets and debt—to disposable income 
is projected to stand far below the exceptional 
peak in mid-2007, but close to its average level 
over the past 50 years. 
Despite these signs of improvement, we think that the aggregate measures overstate the amount of 
financial repair that has occurred.  Several factors are standing in the way of financial repair for 
many households, including high unemployment, pervasive negative home equity 
(affecting, according to our estimates, at least 20 
percent of all home mortgages), and mortgage 
refinancing that has been mostly limited to 
borrowers with good credit scores and sufficient 
home equity.  In addition, the scale of the 
housing market collapse and the financial crisis 
was outside of the bounds of most households’ 
experiences and may have changed consumer 
attitudes about saving and borrowing.  All told, 
even though we expect financial stress on these 
households to gradually lessen, we think that the 
forces of deleveraging and balance sheet repair 
will be a moderating influence on household 
spending for some time.

  The Recovery in Equipment and Software Investment
Spending on equipment and software increased 
 rapidly in the final quarter of 2009 and the first 
half of this year.  Over the four quarters ending 
last quarter, real E&S rose 16 percent.  Moreover, E&S investment has been a major contributor to 
the recovery, accounting for approximately one-
third of the increase in ov erall output over this 
period—about the same contribution as PCE—
despite constituting less than 7 percent of GDP.   
Investment spending during the recovery has followed a fairly typical cyclical pattern.  As 
shown in the figure below, real E&S spending 
usually falls sharply in recessions—a response to 
the decline in sales, heightened uncertainty about 
the outlook, and relatively tight credit conditions.  
A rapid recovery generally follows as firms 
respond to the improvement in sales prospects 
and the relatively low costs of borrowing that typify the onset of recovery.  Recoveries are also 
usually boosted by the resumption of investment 
projects that were deferred because of the 
increased uncertainty and financing difficulties. The same factors have likely been in play during this recession:  The steep investment 
decline reflected the severity of the recession, 
extraordinarily high uncertainty about the 
outlook, and unusually tight credit conditions.  
The subsequent bounceback in investment 
growth has likely been boosted, in part, by the 
ensuing pent-up demand.  
However, even with the rapid pickup in E&S growth over the past few quarters, the level of 
investment has risen only enough to produce 
meager gains in the capital stock.  The top 
figure on the next page shows the four-quarter 
change in the E&S capital stock.  In the year 
ending last quarter, the capital stock increased 
at an anemic rate, after having actually fallen 
for several quarters—the first declines in the post–World War II period.  Although the drop 
in gross investment dur ing the recession was 
larger than in most previous downturns, that 
alone does not  fully  explain the fall in the 
capital stock and the subsequent weak recovery. 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
September 15, 2010
Page 23 of 104 
The other important factor has been an increase 
over time in the amount of investment required to replace the capital stock—that is, a rising 
depreciation rate.  This development reflects the 
gradual shift in the composition of the capital 
stock toward assets with  shorter service lives 
such as computers and software.  Thus, a portion of the large gains in investment over the past 
several quarters has served only to bring capital 
spending back up to the level of replacement 
investment.   Going forward, we project that outlays for E&Swill continue to rise solidly, albeit not 
spectacularly—a reflec tion of the subpar  
recovery in business sales that we are projecting and the waning of the boost from pent-up 
demand.  As investment rises further above the 
level required to replace depreciated capital, the 
growth rate of the capital stock picks up in the 
medium term though it remains quite low for a 
recovery.

3 The 5¾ percent figure for the NAIRU does not include the effects of extended and emergency 
unemployment benefits (EEB).  EEB programs add to the unemployment rate by inducing individuals who 
would otherwise have dropped out of the labor force to report themselves as unemployed in order to receive these benefits, and by enabling jobseekers to be more deliberate in their search.  We estimate that these 
programs are currently boosting the unemployment rate by close to 1 percentage point, and we anticipate 
that this effect will diminish throughout the forecast period as these progra ms are phased out.  As a result,

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookdeclining, albeit at a slower pace, throughout 2011 and most of 2012.  Indeed, elevated 
vacancy rates and low commercial property prices, as well as our expectation that lending 
conditions for commercial real estate will rema in tight for quite some time, suggest that a 
substantial turnaround in this se ctor remains some years away. 
In addition, government purchases are projected to rise at a very subdued pace 
over the next few years.  For the federal gove rnment, declines in e xpenditures related to 
Iraq and the waning of stimulus-related nondefens e expenditures are projected to slow the 
rise in real expenditures to just 1 percent in 2011 and ¼ pe rcent in 2012.  In the state and 
local sector, budget pressures ar e projected to ease only slowly , as the projected rise in 
tax collections from the recovering economy is  partially offset by the unwinding of the 
federal stimulus grants.  As a re sult, real spending in this se ctor is projected to increase 
only about ½ percent next ye ar and 1¼ percent in 2012.   
Finally, net exports are anticipated to be about neutral, on balance, for the 
recovery in real GDP over the medium term.  Supported by moderate foreign GDP 
growth and continued dollar de preciation, real exports are pr ojected to rise more than 
7 percent per year, on average,  during 2011 and 2012.  At the same time, real imports are 
projected to increase at a 6 percent annual ra te, driven by the increase in U.S. GDP.  
Exports and imports grow a little more slowly  than in the August forecast, in line with 
our markdowns to economic gr owth here and abroad.

As described in the box “Str uctural Unemployment and Revisions to the Staff’s 
NAIRU,” we have raised our estimate of th e current level of NAIRU from 5¼ percent to 
5¾ percent, with that increment assumed to have occurred gradually over 2008 and 
2009.3  As a result, we marked down our esti mate of potential GDP  growth over this

 Structural Unemployment and Re visions to the Staff’s NAIRU
In the staff’s view, the sharp run-up in the 
unemployment rate since late 2007 has been 
large ly cyclical rather than structural.  That said, 
we  now think that the NAIRU has increased by 
more than we had assumed earlier, and we have 
raised our estimate of the current NAIRU by an 
additional ½ percentage point to 5¾ percent.   
The steep increase in unemployment resulting 
from permanent layoffs (shown  in the figure to the 
lower left) is a key factor underlying our assumed increase in structural unemployment.  Permanent 
job loss often requires affected individuals to 
change industries, occupations, or locations in 
order to become reemployed.  Further, such 
workers typically experience longer spells of 
unemployment than do workers who lose their jobs 
through temporary layoffs or who become unemployed upon entering the labor force.  
Because this measure has remained stubbornly 
high, these workers’ obstacl es to a successful job 
search—such as skill mismatch or skill depreciation—appear to have been greater than we 
had previously thought. One piece of evidence that permanent job loss has 
led to a larger rise in structural unemployment  
than we had previously assumed is the outward movement in the Beveridge Curve (shown in the 
figure to the lower right), which represents the 
relationship between the job-vacancy rate and the 
unemployment rate.
1  Movements in the 
Beveridge Curve can occur for several reasons, and, indeed, the continued elevated pace of layoffs 
and the effects on the unemployment rate of the extensions of unemployment insurance benefits 
have both likely contributed to this outward 
movement.  Nonetheless, job-finding rates for 
unemployed workers (not shown) fell sharply 
during 2008 and 2009 and have remained 
extraordinarily low despite an increase in the 
vacancy rate.  This development suggests that the 
amount of structural unemployment associated 
with job mismatch may have increased as well.  In 
this regard, staff research suggests that the 
observed shift in the Beveridge Curve is roughly 
consistent with the increa se in the staff’s estimate 
of the NAIRU since the beginning of the recession.

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookperiod, leaving the level of pot ential GDP about ¾ percentage  point lower by the end of 
2009.  However, we did not change our assu mption about the growth  rate of potential 
GDP going forward, and continue to assume it will increase at an annual rate of 
2½ percent over the forecast period.   
We have made no material change to  our estimates of structural labor 
productivity.  In particular, we continue to a ssume that structural productivity will grow 
roughly 2 percent per year throughout the medium-term projection.  Likewise, our 
assumptions about the trends in labor fo rce participation and the workweek are 
essentially unchanged from the previous Tealbook forecast. 
Productivity and the Labor Market 
As in recent forecasts, we view the sizable  increase in labor productivity last year 
as having resulted, in part, from pressures that firms placed on workers by aggressively 
cutting staffing even as output increased.  As a consequence, we  judge productivity to 
have moved above its structural level by the end of last year.  Part of  that gap was erased 
over the first half of this year, as firms re sumed hiring and lengthened workweeks despite 
the moderation in the pace of output growth.  We expect this trend to continue over the 
forecast period as firms gradually become more  confident about the recovery and step up 
the pace of hiring to further eas e the strains on their existing workforces.  As a result, we 
project labor productivity to rise  a little less than its struct ural rate in 2011.  By 2012, we 
expect the gap between structural and actua l productivity to have closed, and labor 
productivity to rise at its struct ural rate of about 2 percent.  
However, given the weaker path for real GDP in this forecast, we now expect the 
pickup in employme
nt to be significantly slower than in the August Tealbook.  For 2011, 
employment gains are projected to averag e 200,000 per month, about 50,000 less than in 
the last projection.  This pace of job gains results in a more gradual reduction in the 
unemployment rate, which now edges down from 9¾ percent at the end of this year to 
about 9 percent by the end of 2011, about ¼ per centage point higher th an in the August 
forecast.  For 2012, we expect employment to increase 270,000 per month, on average, 
and the unemployment rate to fall to 8 percent by the end of the year.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookResource Utilization 
The upward revision to our estimate of th e NAIRU implies that , despite the higher 
path for the unemployment rate in this project ion, the projected margin of slack over the 
next two years is not much changed from th e last Tealbook.  Thus, the amount of current 
and projected slack remains very large.  By our estimate, the unemployment rate 
currently stands about 3 percentage points  above the effective NAIRU, and, in the 
projection, the unemployment gap only declines to about 2¼ percentage points by the end 
of 2012.4  This extended period of considerable  labor market slack is likely to be 
associated with other features of a weak la bor market, including below-trend labor force 
participation and an unusually large c oncentration of workers experiencing 
unemployment spells of long duration.  
Similarly, our revision to potential out put means that, even with the downward 
revisions to our projection for the change in real GDP, the level of the gap at the end of 
2011—at 6½ percent—is virtually unchanged from the last forecast.  By the end of 2012, 
the gap shrinks to about 4¾ percent of GDP.   We continue to expect slack in the 
industrial sector to be taken up more quickly than in the economy as a whole, in part 
because manufacturing capacity, after contrac ting 1¼ percent in 2009, is projected to be 
flat, on average, in 2010 and 2011 and to expand only about ¾ percent in 2012.  Indeed, 
by the end of 2012, our projection has the fact ory operating rate returning to about its 
long-run average.  
Compensation and Prices 
We expect that the wide margin of la bor market slack, along with low rates of 
price inflation, will continue to restrain labor costs over the forecast period.  The 
Productivity and Cost measure of compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector 
is projected to rise only about 1¾ per cent in 2011 and roughly 2 percent in 2012.  
Similarly, we expect the employment cost in dex to rise at an annual rate of about 
2 percent over the forecast period.  These modest increases in hourly compensation, in 
combination with the moderate rise in labor productivity in this forecast, result in unit 
labor costs that are about flat in both 2011 and 2012.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookAfter rising at an annual rate  of 3 percent in the second quarter, prices of imported 
core goods (all goods excluding fuels, computer s, and semiconductors) are projected to 
increase at a 1¼ percent pace in the third quarter, a step-down consistent with recent 
monthly readings on import prices.  For the fourth quarter, we forecast that the recent 
increases in nonfuel commodity prices, combin ed with projected do llar depreciation, will 
lead to a temporary pickup in import price inflation to 2¼ percent.  Thereafter, core 
import price inflation settles dow n to 1 percent, in line with our projections of moderate 
dollar depreciation and small increases in commodity prices.   
As in previous forecasts, we anticipate th at reduced labor cost pressures and low 
levels of resource utilization will exert a downward influence on core PCE inflation over 
the projection period, but that these disinfla tionary forces will be mostly checked by 
ongoing stability in inflation expectations.  W ith the degree of slack  in this projection 
roughly the same as in the last projection, we continue to project th at core PCE inflation 
will rise 1.1 percent this year and 0.9 per cent in 2011.  Our projection for core PCE 
inflation for 2012 is also 0.9 per cent.  With food and energy pri ce inflation expected to be 
modest, our projection for headli ne inflation is just a bit a bove core inflation throughout 
the forecast horizon. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2015 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assessments of long-run supply- side conditions, fisc al policy, and other factors.  The 
contour of the long-run outlook depe nds on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long run, 
consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections provided by 
FOMC participants at the June meeting. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities follow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B of th is Tealbook.  We assume that the 
projected decline in the Fed’s holdings will contribute about 20 basis points to 
the rise in the 10-year Treas ury yield over the 2013–15 period. 
 Beyond 2012, the risk premiums on corporate bonds and equity decline gradually to normal levels and banks ease their lending standards somewhat 
further.   
   
   
                                                 
5 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate (R) follows the prescriptions of a Taylor-type rule of 
the form R = 2.5 + π - 1.1(u-u*) + 0.5( π – 2), subject to the zero lower bound constraint.  In this 
expression, π denotes the four-quarter rate of core PCE inflation, u is the civilian unemployment rate, and 
u* is the staff estimate of the NAIRU (with an adju stment for the temporary effects on unemployment of 
the extended and emergency unemployment benefit progra ms).  In essence, this is just the traditional 
Taylor rule, rewritten in terms of the unemployment gap, with the coefficient on resource utilization 
appropriately rescaled.

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook The federal government budget deficit na rrows to about 4½ percent of GDP 
by the end of 2015.  This improvement re flects the effects of the economic 
recovery on tax receipts and transfer payments as well as further policy 
actions after 2012 aimed at  reducing the deficit. 
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate 
1¼ percent per year in the 2013–15 period.  The price of WT I crude oil rises 
to around $90 per barrel by the end of 2015, consistent with futures prices.  
Under these assumptions, movements in the prices of energy and imports have 
only minor implications for domestic infl ation in the extension.  Foreign real 
GDP expands, on average, about 3¼ percent per year from 2013 through 
2015, with foreign economies growi ng close to their trend rates. 
 After 2012, the NAIRU remains at 5¾ pe rcent, reflecting our view that a 
prolonged period of high unemployment is  likely to have persistent adverse 
effects on the functioning of the labor market.  Potential GDP is assumed to 
expand by 2½ percent per year from 2013 to 2015.  
The unemployment rate enters 2013 well above the assumed NAIRU, and the 
staff’s estimate of the output gap is still very wide.  Real GDP rises at an annual rate of 
4½ percent on average in 2013 and 2014, notably above its potential pace, as improved 
confidence, reduced uncertainty, and suppor tive financial conditions allow aggregate 
demand to catch up with aggregate supply.  Unemployment falls over this period, 
inflation moves back toward the assumed l ong-run target, and the federal funds rate 
continues to rise, reaching 3¾ percent in 2015.5  With improvements in confidence and 
financial conditions largely co mplete by 2015, gains in real GDP move back toward gains 
in underlying potential; in addition, the une mployment rate falls to the NAIRU, and 
consumer price inflation reaches 1½ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Although foreign GDP data for the second quarter proved stronger than we had 
anticipated, more recent indicators support our expectation that the pace of activity 
abroad will slow significantly in  the second half of this year .  The second-quarter strength 
reflected surprisingly vigorous GDP growth for a number of economies, particularly the 
euro area and Mexico.  The euro -area performance appears to reflect greater resilience in 
the face of the region’s debt-related financ ial stresses than we had anticipated, and we 
have carried some of this momentum forward, but we judge that Mexi co’s second-quarter 
surge reflected transitory factors.  Indicators for the third quarter, in contrast, have come 
in on the weak side of our expectations.  Th e softer tone of the foreign data, along with 
downward revisions to the path of U.S. GDP , has led us to mark down the outlook for 
foreign GDP growth by ½ percentage point in the second half of the year and by 
¼ percentage point in 2011. 
We now project that foreign economic activ ity will slow from an annual rate of 
5½ percent in the first half of this year to 2¾ percent in the second half, as the recovery in 
global trade, manufacturing, and inventories matures.  Thereafter, economic growth picks 
up to 3½ percent by 2012 as a gradual revival in private spending more than offsets the 
withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stim ulus.  Although fiscal policy should be 
approximately neutral this year, we continue to project that fiscal consolidation efforts 
will exert a drag on foreign growth in 2011 and 2012.

   Foreign inflation was pushed down in the second quarter, as food and energy 
prices decelerated.  Inflation is  expected to rebound to an annu al rate of nearly 2 percent
in the current quarter and a bit higher thereafter as food and energy prices pick back up. Continued resource slack, especially in th e advanced economies, should keep foreign 
inflation subdued over the rema inder of the forecast period, with Japan remaining in 
deflation throughout.    
 
 
 With inflation prospects well contained, we continue to expect that monetary 
policy abroad will remain generally accommodative.  This morning, Japanese authorities unilaterally intervened in foreign exchange ma rkets to weaken the yen in an effort to 
bolster the economy’s flagging growth.  (For  further details, see the box, “The Recent 
Appreciation of the Yen,” and the “Financial Developments” section.)  In contrast, since 
the August Tealbook, central banks in a number of economies where the recoveries have 
become more firmly established, including Canada, Sweden, and some emerging market economies (EMEs), have tightened policy.  
 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Output growth in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) came in at 3 percent in 
the second quarter, slightly weaker than we had expecte d, as a surprising surge in 
euro-area economic growth was offset by mo re tepid figures for Canada and Japan.  
Going forward, we expect AFE economic activity to continue to moderate, in particular 
as fiscal austerity and financial stresses weigh on Europe.  After bottoming out next year 
at around 2 percent, AFE economic growth rises to 2½ percent in 2012 as financial 
stresses wane and demand from the United States and EMEs picks up.  Incoming data 
and somewhat more modest expectations fo r global economic activity have led us to 
revise down our projected path of AFE ec onomic growth around ¼ percentage point 
compared with the previous Tealbook.   
 
Economic Activity  
 Euro area .   Incoming data for the euro area s how that the region’s fiscal stresses 
have led to increasingly dive rgent economic outcomes across member countries but have 
yet to stymie economic growth for the regi on as a whole.  Euro -area real GDP grew 
almost 4 percent in the second quarter, a full percentage poin t higher than an ticipated in 
the August Tealbook.  Economic growth was r obust across the main Northern European 
members with a particularly robust perfor mance in Germany, where strong external

The Recent Appreciation of the Yen 
 
Japanese officials warned about the dangers of 
“excessive exchange rate volatility” in August 
and early September and then intervened 
 unilaterally on September 15 to weaken the yen.  The intervention resulted in the yen depreciating 
 roughly 3 percent against the dollar to about ¥86 per dollar.  Before the intervention, the yen 
had appreciated roughly 10 percent against the 
dollar since May, continuing a trend that saw the value of the yen rise from about ¥125 per dollar 
in August 2007 to ¥83 per dollar just before the 
intervention. 
A number of factors have contributed to the yen’s appreciation against the dollar in recent years.  
U.S. interest rates have declined, significantly 
narrowing the gap with Japan’s low interest rates, 
and expectations for U.S. GDP growth have 
recently declined relative to those for Japan.  
Diminished risk appetite has also boosted the yen 
over the last few years, and most recently it has 
played an important role as uncertainty about the 
global economy has increased.  According to this 
explanation, when risk aversion increases, Japanese investors pull back from risky foreign 
investments and bring funds home, thereby  
lifting the yen against other currencies, including the dollar. 
While the nominal value of the yen is close to historic highs against the U.S. dollar, the real 
effective value of the yen is well below the high 
reached in 1995, and is, in  fact, currently close to 
its average value over the past decade.  Furthermore, the recent increases in both the nominal and the real effective values of the yen 
are within the range of normal variation 
experienced over the last two decades. 
Perhaps most important, the appreciation of the yen does not appear to have prevented a recovery 
in Japanese exports.  Since bottoming out in 
early 2009, Japanese real merchandise exports 
have rebounded more than 60 percent, and the 
nominal trade balance as a share of GDP has 
returned to a surplus comparable in size to those 
experienced during the past two decades.

  demand helped fuel a 9 percent surge in real GDP.  In contrast, economic growth in Spain 
and Portugal was only weakly positive, and Gree k GDP contracted at a 7 percent pace as 
private consumption and investment plumme ted.  Second-quarter GDP data for Ireland 
have yet to be released, but financial conditions worsened over the intermeeting period on 
further revelations about the poor performance of the major banks.  (For a discussion, see

 For the euro area as a whole, indicators for activity in the current quarter suggest 
some moderation from the rapid second-quart er pace.  Euro-area purchasing managers 
indexes (PMIs) for August edged down, and industrial production was flat in July.  
However, these indicators came in better th an we had expected, and retail sales and 
consumer confidence also suggest more mo mentum than we had anticipated in the 
August Tealbook.  Accordingly, we have re vised up our estimate for euro-area GDP 
growth in the second half nearly ½ percenta ge point to 1¾ percent.  Going forward, we 
continue to believe that signi ficant headwinds remain, as c ountries implement substantial 
fiscal consolidation, the impetus from the i nventory cycle fades, and stresses in the 
banking sector persist.  We expect euro-a rea economic growth to slow further to  
1½ percent in 2011 before picking up  to about 2 percent in 2012.   
 
 Our outlook for the euro area is conditi onal on a gradual easing of the financial 
pressures that emerged in the spring of 2010, based on tangible progress toward cutting 
budgets.  Indeed, to date, peri pheral euro-area count ries have been implementing fiscal 
consolidation plans in line with their comm itments.  Based on our projections, however, 
the significant fiscal consolidation undertaken  by Greece will not be sufficient to stabilize

 its government debt as a share of GDP, a vi ew shared by many market participants.  
Therefore, we do not expect Greece to re gain access to market funding at reasonable 
interest rates in early 2012, as is currently written into the joint International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) and European Union (EU) program.  As such, we expect that the IMF and 
the EU will, at a minimum, lengthen the ma turity of their curr ent loans to Greece and 
commit additional funds.  A more ambitious plan, which would better assure the long-run sustainability of Greek debt, would also include  a restructuring of the Greek debt held by 
the private sector.  Regardless of the steps that are eventually taken to address the Greek 
debt situation, we continue to assume that there will be only minimal spillovers to other 
euro-area economies, although more severe outcomes are clearly possible. 
United Kingdom .  Recently released data indicate  that an up swing in inventories 
accounted for most of the United Kingdom’s 5 percent increase in GDP in the second 
quarter.  Final domestic demand increased only ¾ percent, significantly less than we had 
estimated, as a sharp decline in investment  largely offset a rebound in consumption.  
Accordingly, and consistent with purchasing managers surveys and confidence 
indicators, we see economic growth moderati ng to 1½ percent in th e second half of the 
year.  Thereafter, a sharp fiscal consolid ation should subtract roughly 1¾ percentage 
points from GDP growth in both 2011 and 2012.  Nonetheless, we see GDP growth 
picking up to 2½ percent by the end of 2012 as a weak pound supports exports and some 
healing in financial conditions helps to revive private spending. 
Japan.  Japanese real GDP slowed to 1½ pe rcent in the second quarter.  External 
dem
and continued to drive the recovery, but private domestic demand was tepid.  
Indicators for the third quarte r have been mixed.  Real c onsumption expanded at a solid 
pace in July, but industrial production fell and the manufacturing PMI for August declined to its lowest level in more than a y ear.  We project real GDP  growth to rise to 
nearly 2 percent by the end of 2012 as privat e domestic spending picks up.  Over the 
intermeeting period, the Japanese govern ment, under mounting political pressure, 
announced a new stimulus plan to boost employment and help small businesses, but this plan is too small to affect our outlook.  We also see the economic effects of today’s 
intervention by the Japanese authorities in foreign exchange markets as being small. 
Canada.   After expanding at an annual rate of nearly 6 percent in the first quarter, 
real GDP in Canada rose at a disappo inting 2 percent pace in the second, with 
consumption spending especially weak.  In reaction, we have carried some of this

      Recent Developments in th e Irish Banking System
In August, bad news about bank earnings and 
asset quality reduced investor confidence in 
Ireland’s banking system and heightened 
concerns that Irish banks may remain fragile 
for a prolonged period.  In addition, the news 
raised questions about whether Ireland’s 
already strapped government will be able to 
continue to support the banking system on the 
scale needed to avoid a crisis.  As a result of 
these concerns, S&P downgraded Ireland’s 
sovereign credit rating to AA- from AA, and 
credit default swap (CDS) premiums on the 
debt of Irish banks and of the Irish government 
increased significantly—both relative to their 
levels in early August and relative to increases  
seen in other peripheral European countries. Asset Quality 
The news in August centered on Ireland’s 
three largest banks, which collectively hold 
80 percent of the banking system’s assets.  
Early in the month, the European 
Commission authorized new capital 
injections for Anglo Irish Bank (Anglo) of 
up to €10 billion, corresponding to 
11.5 percent of Anglo’s assets.  The Bank of 
Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, Ireland’s two 
largest banks, announced large first-half 
losses and disclosed that their 
nonperforming loan ratios increased 
substantially, by about 30 to 40 percent from 
year-end 2009 to the end of June 2010. 
 
These announcements reinforced perceptions 
that the asset quality of the Irish banking 
system is poor and worsening, driven by 
deteriorating economic conditions and a sharp 
drop in home prices.  The rapidly growing 
nonperforming loans, coupled with poor 
earnings, have intensified capital needs, and a 
further deterioration of asset quality is likely if 
economic conditions do not improve.  For example, the capital injection received by 
Anglo in August was barely sufficient to cover 
its 2010 loan loss expenses to date.  Indeed, 
Anglo is seen as likely to need further capital 
injections, with estimates of future losses 
ranging from €2 billion to €10 billion.  
 
These developments likely would have 
exacerbated funding pressures for Irish banks 
were it not for a government guarantee of new 
bank liabilities with maturities of less than five
years.  These guarant ees were originally 
planned to end this month but were extended until the end of 2010.  Irish banks may face 
intensified funding pressures when these 
guarantees expire.  
 
Fiscal Burden  
In response to the financial crisis and the bursting of its real estate bubble, the Irish government has injected capital of €33 billion into five banks, including Anglo, 
which it nationalized in December 2008.  It 
also established the National Asset 
Management Agency (NAMA) to purchase 
distressed real estate loans from banks.  To 
date, loans with a face value of €27 billion 
have been transferred to NAMA, at an 
average discount of about 50 percent.     
Including these expenditures, S&P now estimates that the total gross costs, 
excluding future reco veries, to the Irish 
government of cleaning up the banks through recapitalization and the costs of 
NAMA transfers will be €90 billion.  These 
costs amount to more than 55 percent of 
GDP and will add to an already heavy fiscal 
burden in Ireland, where the deep recession 
has led to a sharp deterioration in public 
finances.  However, the long-run costs to the 
government of supporting the banking 
system could be lower than these gross 
figures, depending on ultimate repayments 
of capital injections and recovery values for 
assets purchased.

  weakness in consumption forward, revisi ng down our second-half forecast by about 
¾ percentage point to 2½ per cent.  Despite increases in th e number of jobs, which should 
support consumption, we expect economic gr owth to edge up only modestly over the 
forecast period, restrained by a somewhat mo re subdued projection for the United States 
than in the August Tealbook. 
 
Monetary Policy 
 With a subdued recovery in economic activity, and inflation prospects still 
contained, we project that monetary policy abroad will generally remain accommodative 
over the forecast period.  For the Bank of E ngland, we pushed back our expectation for 
the first rate hike to early 2012 because of th e recent softness in final domestic demand.  
We anticipate that the ECB will maintain ea sy monetary and liquidity conditions and 
keep its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1 percent until mid-2012.  Conversely, at its
recent meeting, the Bank of Canada hiked its target for the overnight rate 25 basis points 
to 1 percent, and we expect further m odest increases to 1¾ percent by 2012 amid 
relatively limited resource slack.    
  
 The Bank of Japan likely will keep its ta rget for the call rate close to zero well 
beyond 2012.  At an unscheduled meeting on August 30, the Bank of Japan introduced a new facility offering up to ¥10 trillion ($118 billion) in six-month funds at its current target rate.  This meager policy measure wa s reportedly made in response to pressure 
from the government, which has become incr easingly concerned a bout the risks caused 
by the rising yen to Japan’s recovery.  As noted previously, Ja panese authorities 
intervened in foreign exchange markets this morning in an effort to weaken the yen. 
 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
 Economic activity in the EMEs appears to have slowed markedly in the current quarter, following a surge in growth to nearly  10 percent in the second.  A leap of about 
13 percent in Mexican GDP, along with upside surprises in a number of other economies, 
led us to revise up EME growth by more than 3 percentage points fo r the second quarter.  
However, incoming data for the current quarter  have turned notably softer:  Industrial 
production decelerated in July in a number of  economies, and exports also declined in 
some cases.  PMIs for July and August generally moved down relativ e to their second-
quarter levels but nonetheless remained in  the expansion range in most economies.

  All told, we now expect economic growth in the EMEs to drop to 3½ percent in 
the second half of this year.  Much of th is deceleration was foreseen in our August 
forecast, and we revised down our second-half  projection by only ¾ percentage point.  
This revision reflects a combination of the weaker-than-expected data mentioned above, 
payback in Mexico from its surprising sec ond-quarter surge, and the markdown to the 
U.S. outlook.  In 2011 and 2012, we project EME economic growth to step up to roughly 
4¾ percent per year, a rate we view as sustainable and in li ne with the projected firming 
in activity in the advanced economies.

China.  In China, incoming data have reinforced our assessment that GDP growth 
has moderated from
 the rapid pace over th e past year.  Industrial production dipped 
slightly in July but rebounded in Augus t, leaving the three-month change—at 
2.2 percent—similar to the second-quarter p ace.  The PMI, fixed-asset investment, and 
retail sales weakened in Jul y, but improved in August.  Exports moved down in July and 
August, but imports were also soft, resulting in a widening of the trade surplus, on 
average, from the second quarter.  
 
In response to the weaker U.S. outlook, we  have revised our pr ojection of GDP in 
China down about ¼ percentage point to 8 percent in the second half of this year.  For 
2011 and 2012, Chinese economic growth edges up to 8½ percent.  Although concerns 
have been raised that China may be head ing for a sharp slowdown, perhaps reflecting 
excesses in its property market, we see recent developments as broadly consistent with 
only a moderation in the pace of growth, in line with the intentions of the Chinese authorities.  In addition, we believe that the authorities have sufficient scope for further

  fiscal stimulus should the economy slow cons iderably; some additi onal infrastructure 
projects and accelerated pub lic housing construction have already been approved.  
However, absent signs of such a slowdown, au thorities are likely to resume tightening 
monetary policy la ter this year.  
 
Other Emerging Asia.  Elsewhere in emerging Asia, re cent data also point to a 
deceleration
 in activity.  In July, industrial  production weakened in several countries, and 
exports generally fell.  The slowdown in exports  seen so far appears to be concentrated 
more in sales to China than to the United St ates, suggesting that w eakness in the United 
States is not the primary driv er of the moderation of activit y in the region.  Readings on 
PMIs for July and August moved down signi ficantly in some countries—in Singapore 
and Taiwan, PMIs slipped into the contractionary range—and indicators of activity in the 
global electronics sector weakened a bit.  All told, we projec t GDP growth in the 
emerging Asian economies other than China to fall to about 3 percent in the second half 
of this year, a bit below the August Tealbook forecast because of weaker-than-expected 
data as well as the markdown to the U.S. outlook.  Thereafter, economic growth should 
pick up to about 4½ percent as cond itions in the global economy firm. 
 
We do not yet see any strong evidence th at the moderation of activity we are 
observing in emerging Asia is signaling a more pronounced slowdown in the region.  
Moreover, even outside of China, we believ e that these economies have scope to use 
expansionary policy to support economic growth.  Even so, the possibility that the recent 
deceleration in activity may portend a sharpe r slowdown than we now expect is an 
important downside risk to th e outlook, which is explored in  the “Risks and Uncertainty” 
section. 
Latin America.  In Mexico, GDP growth surged to  an annual rate of 13½ percent 
in the second quarter following a contra ction in the first, propelled by strong 
ma
nufacturing production and agricultural output.  We believe that this performance 
reflects transitory factors that will dissipate going forward, consistent with the 
deceleration of industrial production in recen t months.  Accordingly, we project that 
economic growth will step down in the current quarter and average about 1¾ percent for the remainder of this year.  This projecti on is roughly 1½ percenta ge points lower than 
that in the previous forecast, reflecting payback from the second-quarter surprise.  Over the next two years, Mexican GDP growth rises to about 4 percent, in  line with the contour 
of U.S. manufacturing production.

  In contrast to Mexico, GDP growth slowed  in Brazil in the se cond quarter from its 
unsustainable double-digit pace in the first.  We forecast that Brazilian economic growth 
will move down further to 3½ percent in the sec ond half of this year, partly reflecting the 
withdrawal of tax incentives for purchases of  autos and other consumer durables and as 
the recent tightening of moneta ry policy takes hold.  For Latin America as a whole, we 
project that real GDP growth will move down to about 2½ percent in  the second half of 
this year and then rise to about 4 percen t by the end of 2012, as Brazil and Mexico grow 
close to trend.

Financial Developments  
Since the August FOMC meeting, investors have focused intently on news 
concerning the global economic outlook and on communications by Federal Reserve 
officials .  Early in the period, against the backdrop of the more -cautious tone in the 
August FOMC statement, investors marked down their outlook considerably in response 
to weaker -than-expected incoming data.  Subsequently, they took some comfort from the 
Chairman’s Jackson Hole speech and from more-positive data on manufacturing acti vity 
and the labor market.  On balance, however, market participants appear to have pared their expectations for economic growth.  The  anticipated path of the federal funds rate 
shifted down somewhat over the intermeeting period , and survey information suggests 
that investors now see greater odds that the Federal Reserve will resume asset purchases 
than at the time of the August meeting.  In this environment, the Treasury yield curve flattened, with yields about unchanged at the short end and down as much a s 25 basis 
points at the long end.  TIPS -based inflatio n compensation for the next 5 years moved 
down, reflecting in part lower oil prices , while inflation compensation 5- to-10 years 
ahead increased slightly on net.  Stock prices edged down and risk spread s on corporate 
bonds were about unchanged; the broad nominal value of the dollar also posted little net 
change.  Meanwhile, conditions in short- term funding markets generally eased a bit  over 
the intermeeting period .    
Credit conditions for business and households continued to be mixed .  Borrowing 
by nonfinancial corporations was  strong in August and indicators of corporate credit 
quality remained solid .  Commercial  mortgage debt contracted further  in the second 
quarter , and conditions in commercial real estate markets  have generally remained  
strained  over the intermeeting period, though some sig ns of stabilization  are evident .  For 
households, low mortga ge rates supported a relatively high level of refinancing activity , 
but many  borrowers remain unable to refinance  because of negative equity and weak  
credit scores.   Mortgage debt and consumer credit contracted in the second quarter, and 
consumer credit decreased further in July.  On the positive side, m easures of credit 
quality for both prime residential mo rtgages and consumer loans continued to show some 
improvement. 
Total loans at c ommercial bank s contracted at a slower pace in July and August 
than earlier in the year .  M2 expanded moderately , on average, over the two months as

  growth in liquid deposits an d currency continued to more than offset declines in small 
time deposits and retail money market mutual funds. 
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Policy expectations moved down, on balance,  over the intermeeting period .1  
E
arly in the period, money market futures rates fell significantly in response to economic 
data that came in below expectations, as well as to the August FOMC statement, which 
investors seemed to read as providing a somewhat more -downbeat assessment of the 
econo mic outlook than expected .  The Chairman’s Jackson Hole  speech was reportedly 
viewed as being more encouraging  about economic prospects and as providing more 
clarity regarding the nontraditional policy options the Federal Reserve has at its disposal, 
but did not appear to have any  sustain ed effect on policy expectations .  The release of the 
minutes of the August FOMC meeting also prompt ed little market reaction.  The 
expected path for policy retraced a large part  of its earlier decline following the ISM 
manufacturing report, the employment report, and the data on initial jobless claims  
released early this month , but the path has shifted back down over the past few days.   
On balance, futures quotes, combined with the usual staff assumptions for term 
premiums, indicate that t he ex pected policy path moved down somewhat in the second 
half of 2011 and more noticeably in 2012.  T he implied federal funds rate in the fourth 
quarter of 2012 now stands at 80 basis points, down from about 100 basis points at the time of the August FOMC meet ing.  Quotes on interest rate caps suggest that the modal 
path of the federal funds rate revised less than the expected path, with the modal path continuing to rise above the current target range in  the middle of 2012.   
Results from the September survey o f primary dealers indicate  that market 
participants lowered their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate in tandem with a downward revision to their forecast for economic growth through 2012.  Respondents reported an average probability of about 90 percent that the first tightening 
would not occur until the third quarter of 2011 or later, compared with a probability of 
about 70 percent in the August survey.  In addition, t he dealers assigned a probability of 
about 40 percent to the Federal Reserve expanding its balance sheet through additional purchases before the end of the year, compared with a probability of about 20 percent in the previous survey.  The survey respondents indicated that expanding the Federal

intraday standard deviation averaging about 3 basis points.

Reserve’s balance sheet  through pu rchases of Treasury securities  was far more likely than 
through purchases of agency MBS or agency debt over the next two years.   
The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened  somewhat, on balance, over the 
intermeeting period.  Yields for maturities up to tw o years  were little  changed , while 
yields at maturities of 5, 10, and 20 years fell 8 basis points, 16 basis points, and 24 basis 
points, respectively.  Among the factors contributing to the drop in longer- term yields, 
market participants pointed to a weak er outlook for the economy, greater odds  of 
additional large- scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, and strong demand for 
long- duration assets by institutional investors .     
TIPS -based inflation compensation over the next 5 years fell about 15 basi s points 
over the intermeeting period, amid lower oil prices, while inflation compensation 5- to-10 
years ahead increased about 10 basis points.  Forward TIPS-based inflation compensation 
might have been boosted by a partial unwinding of recent safe- haven f lows in response to 
more -positive economic releases in the second half of the intermeeting period ; the 
unwinding of these flows would tend to raise nominal Treasury yields more than TIPS yields, thus increasing measured inflation compensation.  Both 5- year and 5- to  10-year 
inflation compensation based on inflation swaps, measures that should be largely unaffected by special factors that may have influenced the Treasury market, declined somewhat on net over the intermeeting period .  (See the box “Have Inflation 
Expectations Moved Lower?” for an analysis of the substantial decline in inflation compensation since the spring.)      
ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad  stock price indexes edged down, on balance, over the intermeeting  period, 
and option- implied volatility for the S&P 500 index was little changed on net .  The 
spread between the staff’s estimate of the expected real return on equity for S&P 500 firms and an estimate of the real 10 -year Treasury yield —a rough measure of the equity 
risk premium—remained  at an elevated level .  One factor that appears to have kept the 
equity premium high is a reluctance by households to invest in stocks given the large losses incurred during the financial crisis and the lingering uncertainty about the economic outlook.  Consistent with this interpretation, there continued to be sizable net outflows from equity mutual funds and strong net inflows toward bond funds in August.

TIPS - and Swaps -Based Inflation Compensation  
Financial Developments
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
September 15, 2010
Page 56 of 104   
Have Inflation Expectations Moved Lower? 
Since late April, TIPS -based inflation compensation, 
defined as the difference between yields on nominal 
Treasury securities and those on comparable- maturity 
TIPS, has decreased significantly.  As shown in the chart below, inflation compensation over the next 5 years (adjusted for carry effects) and 5 -to-10 years 
ahead fell about 60 and 50 basis points, respectively, 
with the largest declines occurring around periods of 
heightened investor concerns about the implications of the European financial strains and around the releases of weaker -than-expected economic data.  Inflation 
compensation based on inflation swaps has declined by a slightly larger  amount since spring. 
As can be seen from the table to the right, the staff’s 
term structure model attr ibutes about two-thirds of the 
decline in inflation compensation since April to lower 
inflation expectations, plotted in the second set of 
charts, while reduced inflation risk premiums 
accounted for about one-third of the change. 
However, survey measures o f longer- term inflation 
expectations (also shown in the second set of charts) 
have been generally stable since April.  These observations suggest that the decline in measured inflation compensation since spring might have been partially driven by special factors that are not well captured by the term structure model rather than by a 
shift in inflation expectations.  In particular:  
• Safe-haven demands for nominal Treasury securities 
may have caused nominal yields to decline more 
than TIPS yields and hence put some downward 
pressure on inflation compensation. 
• Anecdotal evidence suggests that investors might 
now assign higher odds to additional large- scale 
asset purchases than in April. The associated increase in the expected future demand for nominal 
Treasury securities relative to TIPS might have contributed to a narrowing in inflation 
compensation. 
• Market participants indicate that liquidity conditions in the TIPS market have worsened somewhat since 
April, as trading volumes have declined, while trading conditions in nominal Treasury securities 
remained stable.  As a result, the TIPS liquidity 
premium may have increased, causing a decline in inflation compensation.  
• Mortgage refinancing activity has picked up in 
recent months as long- term interest rates have fallen.  
In the past, an increase in refinancing has at times 
led to mortgage-related hedging flows that reinforced the decline in nominal Treasury yields

 but had minimal effect on the TIPS market.  This 
pattern would push inflation compensation lower. 
Regression analysis suggests that proxies for the first 
three special factors can account for a portion of the decline in measured inflation compensation in recent months.  In contrast, mortgage-related hedging demand 
reportedly has been limited in part because the Federal 
Reserve’s purchases of mortgage -backed securities 
(MBS) have left a relatively small amount of recently 
issued and more interest rate -sensitive MBS in private 
hands; refinancing activity on seasoned mortgages is 
reportedly lower, in part because such mortgages typically have higher loan- to-value ratios and so are 
more difficult to refinance.  
That said, our proxies for the special factors can 
explain only a fairly small part of the decline in 
inflation compensation.  Thus, a part of the decline might well reflect a downward shift in inflation expectations among financial market participants, in 
contrast to the apparent stability of expectations 
reported in surveys of private forecasters and 
households.  In part, this divergence between inflation expectations based on TIPS and survey readings of inflation expectations may reflect differences in views 
across different sets of economic agents.  In addition, 
the survey measures may reflect the modal expectations of those surveyed, while TIPS inflation 
compensation may capture mean expectations.  Thus, 
an increase in downside risks to the inflation outlook could have pulled inflation compensation down relative to the survey measures.  Indeed, the weaker 
economic data that has come in since spring has le d 
some to worry about the possibility of deflation, and 
estimated probabilities of deflation measured from TIPS have moved up since April, though they 
remain  low.
 
   
                                                 
2The Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision announced an agreement on higher global 
minimum capital standards on September 12 that will be phased in between 2013 and January 2019.  Ba nks 
will see capital standards tightened through exclusions from the definition of regulatory capital, higher risk 
weights on some assets, higher minimum regulatory capital ratios, and by the introduction of a 
“conservation” buffer.  When fully phased in, the minimum ratios for Tier 1 capital and total capital relative to risk -weighted assets will be 6 percent and 8 percent, respectively, with the common equity 
component of Tier 1 capital representing at least 4½ percent of risk -weighted assets.  In additio n, banks 
will be required to maintain a conservation buffer of 2 ½ percent above each of these three minimums to 
avoid restrictions on cash distributions.

Over the intermeeting period, bank stocks underperformed  the broader equity 
market , while continuing to be more volatile .  Alt hough bank stocks are generally more 
sensitive to a markdown in the economic outlook, the greater volatility over the 
intermeeting period was also reportedly due to uncertainty about domestic and international financial regulatory  reform  efforts , some of which was resolved with the 
recent announcement of the Basel III capital requirements .

Pricing and conditions in corporate debt markets were stable, on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  C orporate bond spreads were little changed  for both investment-
grade and speculative -grade securities .  Far -term forward spreads  moved up a bit over the 
intermeeting period  and currently stand in the middle part of the range seen during 
economic expansions ; these spread s are likely to be largely u naffected by fluctuations in 
expected defaults and thus provide a relatively clean gauge of risk premiums demanded 
by investors in the corporate bond market.  Measures of liquidity in secondary market s 
for corporate bonds remained stable, while the average bid price moved up and bid- ask 
spreads edged down further in the secondary market for syndicated leveraged loans .  
Conditions in short-term funding markets continued to normalize from recent 
stresses related to concerns about European financial stability.  In secured funding 
markets, repo rates and haircuts on various types of collateral held steady , and spreads on 
30-day asset -backed commercial paper remained low .  Spread s on unsecured 30- day 
financial commercial paper were also little changed at a low le vel.  In dollar funding 
markets, s preads of Libor rates over those on overnight index swaps (OIS) fell further 
over the intermeeting period; the one-month and three-month spreads have fully retraced 
the rise prompted by the euro- area concerns, while the si x-month spread remains slightly 
above the level seen before these concerns emerged.  B ased on rates on short- term 
Eurodollar deposits and other money market instruments, market participants do not 
appear to expect any significant strains in funding markets  over the coming quarter -end.

to several important classes of counterparties and types of collateral over the past three 
months, amid increased demand for funding for most types of securities covered in the survey.  (See the appendix for additional information on the September SCOOS.) Consistent with the SCOOS results, tri- party repo activity incr eased during the summer, 
with the total average daily volume for August reaching a new post-crisis high.  
Nonetheless, the risk appetite of levered investors seems to have remained muted since 
the sharp pullback from risky assets that occurred in May and early June, and overall leverage provided through dealer- intermediated transactions remains well below the 
levels reached prior to the financial crisis.   
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Throughout the month of August, concerns about the possibility of a sharper 
decele ration in the pace of economic activity in the United States and China led investors 
to reprice risky assets.  As a result, equity prices and sovereign bond yields in advanced foreign economies registered substantial drops, and the dollar appreciated again st most 
major currencies  on safe-haven demands.  Since the beginning of September, however, 
these price movements have been largely reversed as better macro data releases in the 
United States a nd abroad have led to some improvement in investor sentiment.   
Headline equity indexes in the advanced foreign economies ended the period little 
changed, while benchmark German and U.K. sovereign yields declined 15 to 20 basis 
points; Japanese rates rose slightly.  Yield spreads relative to German bunds on the  
10-year sovereign bonds of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal widened to near record levels 
amid the general repricing of risky assets  in August , but, in contrast to the subsequent 
overall market upswing noted above, they narrowed only slightly in September.  The ri se 
in Greek spreads also seemed to owe importantly to Greece’s deepening recession , while 
Irish spre ads widened further after Standard & Poor’s lowered Ireland’s long- term 
sovereign rating, citing the ballooning cost to the Irish government of supporting i ts 
banking sector.  (See the box in the International Economic Developments and Outlook 
section, “Recent Developments in the Irish Banking System.”)  Spanish and Italian debt spreads, in contrast, did not rise substantially, and both countries issued sizable  amounts 
of long-term debt over the period.

3 The Swiss National Bank (SNB) revealed in August that it had suffered very large valuation losses on  
the foreign exchange reserves it had accumulated as the result of its intervention earlier this year and in 
2009.  However, these losses, totaling 14.3 billion Swiss francs ($14 billion), almost 3 percent of Swiss GDP, were offset in large part by valuati on gains on the SNB’s gold reserves, by gains related to its support 
of UBS, and by interest income on its bond holdings, leaving a total loss of only 2.8 billion Swiss francs.  The reaction to the SNB’s announcement in the press and in markets was muted.

During the intermeeting period, euro -area bank stock prices fell on continued 
concerns about banking sector soundness, particularly in the peripheral European 
countries.  Two nationalized banks, Anglo Irish Bank (an Irish lender) and Hypo Real Estate (a German lender), announced that they would require additional government support.  Some of the price decline was reversed late in the period, in part on news that the Basel III capital requirements would be phased in over an extended period.  Still, on 
net, banking sector share prices in the euro area dropped 4 percent. 
The broad dollar index was little changed on net on a nominal basis.  Throughout 
the period, on days with worrisome economic news, even when the news emanated from the United States, the dollar tended to appreciate against the euro, sterling, and most emerging market currencies.  In contrast, on such days, the dollar tended to depreciate 
against the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.  Over the perio d, the dollar rose about 
2 percent on net against the euro and sterling, but it declined 3 percent versus the yen and 5 percent against the Swiss franc.
 3
With the yen at a 15 -year high against the dollar in nominal terms, Japanese 
authorities intervened in currency markets on September 15, just after this part of the 
Tealbook had closed.  Japan’s Ministry of Finance announced that it had purchased 
dollars overnight to weaken the value of the yen, its first intervention operation since March 2004.  The operation, which market participants estimated as amounting to between $10 and $20 billion but could be larger, caused the yen to immediately depreciate about 3 percent against the dollar, reversing its rise over the intermeeting period.  The intervention, which was not coordinated with foreign authorities, seemed to 
catch markets by surprise even though Japanese officials had publicly discussed the 
possibility of intervention for some time.  There have been conflicting statements from Japanese officials as t o whether the intervention is a one-time event.  (The box in the 
International Economic Developments and Outlook section, “The Recent Appreciation of the Yen,” discusses the yen’s recent rise and its impacts on the Japanese economy.)   
   
  Market expectations of overnight rates through 2011 declined moderately over the 
intermeeting period  in the euro area and the United Kingdom; they were little changed for 
Japan.  The European Central Bank (ECB) kept its policy rate unchanged but said that it 
would continue to provide term liquidity by offering several more full- allotment three -
month refinancing operations through the end of the year.  Citing “uncertainty about the future, especially for the U.S. economy,” the Bank of Japan (BOJ), announced at a special meeting  of its Policy Board that it would provide 10 trillion yen (about $120 
billion) of six-month liquidity at the policy rate target of 10 basis points.  This program, which is similar to  the B OJ’s existing program of three-month operations, was widely 
seen as  timid by market participants, and Japanese sovereign yields rose in response.  In 
contrast to the continued accommodative stance of the ECB and the BOJ, the Bank of Canada increased its target for the overnight rate 25 basis points, to 1 percent, its third hike since June.  Sweden’s Riksbank also tightened policy, increasing its main policy rate 25 basis points, to 75 basis points.   
Headline equity indexes rose in most emerging market economies, and exchange 
rate movements against the dollar were generall y small.  The Chinese renminbi 
depreciated against the dollar early in the intermeeting period following the release of weaker -than-expected Chinese data, bu t it ended the period up slightly on net.  The 
central banks of Chile, Thailand, and Indonesia tightened monetary policy over the intermeeting period.

further pickup in foreign official holdings of Treasury securities in August, following 
strong purchases in July.   
.  Foreign official holdings of agen cy securities, however , declined a bit in

BUSINESS FINANCE  
Net debt financing of nonfinancial corporations remained robust in August.  Bond 
issuance was strong , a pattern that  has so far persisted in September, while nonfinancial 
commercial paper outstanding contracted, in part reflecting substitutio n toward long- term 
debt amid extremely low levels of corporate bond yields.  Commercial and industrial 
(C&I) loans  outstanding increased on net over July and August , a notable turnaround 
from the steep declines posted during the first half of the year.

The pace of initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings by nonfinancial 
firms slowed in August, partly  reflecting typical seasonal patterns .  In the second quarter, 
equity retirements were about unchanged as cash-financed mergers and acquisitions 
decreased slightly , while share repurchases are estimated to have picked up.  As a result, 
net equity issuance by  nonfinancial corporations is project ed to have remained negative 
in the second quarter.  Although t he recent level of  net retirements does not approach the 
pace seen before the financial crisis, announcements of new cash- financed mergers and 
share repurch ase programs increased notably in July and August, suggesting a pickup in 
equity retirements is in the offing.  
Preliminary second -quarter estimates in the national income and product accounts 
showed solid profit growth for the U.S. corporate sector as a whole.  For S&P 500 firms, 
most second -quarter earnings reports exceeded analyst forecasts by a substantial margin.  
However, the forward guidance offered by firms for the third quarter has been considerably less buoyant.  As of mid- September, analysts had n ot significantly revise d 
their forecasts of year -ahead earnings from those in July. 
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations appears  to have remained solid.  
Preliminary estimates for the second quarter suggest that the aggregate ratio of debt to 
assets for nonfinancial corporations declined a bit further and the aggregate liquid asset 
ratio remained near its highest level in over 20 years.  Upgrades by Moody’s of nonfinancial corporate bonds were moderate but still outpaced downgrades in July and August.  T he six -month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial firms increased slightly  
in August, but remained near its historical lows , while t he KMV expected year -ahead 
default rate for nonfinancial firms remained somewhat elevated  through mid- September , 
reflecting relatively high volatility and low valuations of equities. 
Commercial real estate markets continued to be under pressure, although some 
further signs of stabilization have emerged.  The available data suggest that prices of 
commercial proper ties edged up in the first half of the year, and the volume of 
commercial real estate sales rose again in August.  Two small CMBS deals issued over 
the intermeeting period were well received by investors and several more are expected to come to market this  fall, consistent with the easing of conditions and renewed interest in 
the market for CMBS since the beginning of 2010 reported  in the SCOOS.  Nonetheless, 
the volume of CMBS issuance this year remains minuscule compared with that before the

onset of the financial crisis, and total commercial mortgage debt  has continued to contract 
amid further increases in delinquency rates on commercial mortgages . 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Although m ortgage interest rates touched historical lows during the intermeeting 
period and applications for refinancing have stayed relatively high, many households 
remained unable to refinance because of negative equity and weak credit scores .  In 
addition, mortgage applications for home purchases continued to be sluggish.  The 
average interest rate on 30 -year conforming fixed -rate mortgages declined to just a shade 
above 4¼ percent in early September, but daily data on mortgage offerings (not shown in 
the exhibit) suggest that rates have increased  since then .  The spread between the primary 
mortgage rate and the 10- year Treasury rate moved higher, at least in part because 
capacity constraints have provided mortgage lenders little incentive to lower their rates; 
the spread s of current -coupon MBS rates to Treasury securities  also increased over the 
period.  Meanwhile, i ncoming house price data were mixed, with the Federal Housing 
Finance Agency ( FHFA ) and CoreLogic indexes turning down in recent months, while 
the 20- city S&P/Case-Shiller index inched higher in June for the third month in a row.4
Home mortgage debt decreased at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the second 
quarter, similar to the pace of decline seen over the preceding year.  Delinquencies on outstanding prime mortgages fell further in July , as the share of current mortgages 
transitioning into delinquency, though volatile from month  to month, has trended down 
over the past year .  A part of the decline in delinquency rates also reflects  the 
reclassification of delinquent mortgages entering loan modification programs as being 
“current ,” though the size of this effect is difficult to determine .     
Consumer credit is estimated to have contracted at an annual rate of 1¾  percent in 
July, similar to the rate of decline in the second quarter, as another decrease in revolving 
credit more  than offset a small rise  in nonrevolving credit.  However, c onsumer ABS 
issuance proceeded at a moderate pace in August, as it had in July.  Spreads of consumer 
interest rates to the yield on the two -year Treasury note were little changed on balance.  
The credit quality of consumer loans continued to improve, with most delinquency rates 
dropping further in recent months, perhaps contributing to some thawing of credit

GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
During the intermeeting period, the Treasury issued $243 billion of nominal 
coupon securities across the maturity spectrum and $17 billion of inflation- protected 
securities with 10 - and 30- year maturities.  T he Treasury has con tinued to extend the 
average maturity  of its liabilities by gradually reducing the size of its short er-maturity 
coupon auctions ; the Treasury’s increased TIPS issuance has also had the effect of 
lengthening the duration of its liabilities .  The auctions over the intermeeting period were 
generally well received.  
Gross issuance of short-term municipal bonds was very strong in August, likely 
reflecting continued shortfalls in state and local government revenue; issuance of long-
term municipal bonds remained solid.  The number of municipal bonds downgraded by 
Moody’s in the second quarter continued to outpace the number of upgrades.  Yields on municipal bonds declined over the intermeeting period, and the ratio of yields on long-term municipal bonds to those on comparable- maturity Treasur y securities was little 
changed on net  at a relatively high level.  
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank  credit expanded in August, reflecting significant purchases of Treasury 
securities and agency MBS by some large banks  that offse t a modest further decrease in 
total loans .  Consumer loans fell sharply in August, which some banks attributed to 
charge -offs and paydowns that fueled a steep decline in credit card balances .  In addition, 
both home equity loans and commercial real estate loans continued to contract .  
However, holdings of closed-end residential loans grew moderately in August, reportedly spurred by refinancing activity.  C&I  loans also rose slightly in both July and August, the 
first increases on a month -average basis since late 2008.  The allowance for loan and 
lease losses continued to decline over the past two months, on average,  indicating that 
loss provisioning has not kept pace with charge- offs. 
The Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in the first week of August  
showed that the weighted- average interest rate on C&I loans of less than $25 million fell 
slightly compared with the May survey .  The weighted -average spread on those loans was

unchanged from May at an elevated level , after having increased for eight  consecutive 
quarters.  The weighted -average spread on loans with commitment sizes under 
$1 million —a proxy for lending to smaller firms—moved slightly higher after falling in 
May, but the increase was mainly driven by changes in the spread on loans in the highest 
risk category .   
The most recent commercial bank Call Report s indicate that bank profitability 
remained low but increased modestly in the second quarter, reflecting a widespread decrease in loan loss provisioning.  In the aggregate, delinquency and charge -off rates 
were, however, little changed from the first quarter.  Regulatory  capital ratios edged up 
further from already high levels boosted by hefty retained earnings and a continued decline in risk -weighted assets .  The total of unused commitment s for core loan  
categories continued to contract and, by the end of the second quarter, was down 40 
percent from its peak at the end of 2007.
5
On average over July and August, M2 expanded at an annual rate of 3¼ percent, 
slightly  above its pace in the seco nd quarter.  Liquid deposits, the largest component of 
M2, expanded at a n average pace of  9 percent during July and August , reflecting in part a 
compositional shift from other lower-yielding M2 assets.  Currency also trended higher over the two months, whi le small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds 
continued to contract, as yields  on these assets remained at extremely low levels.  The 
monetary base edged down  at a 1½ percent pace, on average, over the two months as 
reserve balances, which account for about half of the base, declined, more than offsetting the increase in currency  (see the box, “Balance Sheet Developments over the 
Intermeeting Period”) .

Balance S heet D evelopments over the Intermeeting P eriod  
Total assets of the Federal Reserve  edged down 
over the intermeeting period to $2.31 trillion .  In 
line with the FOMC’s decision at the August 
meeting to reinvest principal payments on agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS) and agency 
debt in longer- term U.S. Treasury securities, 
holdings of Treasury securities rose while those of the other secur ities fell.  The timing of these 
transactions, however, did not align perfectly, and 
so securities held outright decreased slightly on 
net.  The Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) conducted nine 
operations to reinvest repayments of principal on 
agency MBS over the intermeeting period.  The operations, which covered a range of maturities for nominal securities, as well as one operation in 
TIPS, totaled about $17.6 billion.   
Lending through liquidity facilities remained at a negligi ble level, with little change in the amount 
of primary credit outstanding and a slight decline 
in the foreign central bank liquidity swaps outstanding under the reestablished arrangements.   
Lending through other credit facilities declined 
slightly over th e period.  On August 30, 2010, 
following the payment of accrued professional fees and the termination or expiration of existing contractual arrangements, the Federal Reserve dissolved  the Commercial Paper Funding Facility 
LLC (CPFF LLC), a limited liabilit y company 
created to purchase commercial paper under the Commercial Paper Funding Facility.  The last commercial paper held by the CPFF LLC 
matured on April 26, 2010.  Total Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) loans 
outstanding declined by about $6 billion  over the 
intermeeting period, reflecting the improved 
conditions in some securitization markets and the resulting increase in prepayments on TALF  loans.   
Support for specific institutions decreased a little over the period, driven mainly by repayment of 
approximately $3.95 billion by American 
International Group, Inc. (AIG), on its revolving credit facility with the FRBNY.  This paydown 
represented the single- largest cash payment that 
AIG has made since the inception of the facility 
and, under the terms of the arrangement, the paydown also reduced the maximum amount 
available through the facility from about  
$34 billion to about $30 billion.  Preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings LLC remained unchanged.  Net 
portfolio holdi ngs for each of the Maiden Lane 
LLCs declined slightly.  
On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet, the U.S. Treasury’s supplementary financing account held  steady at $200  billion, 
while the Tre asury’s general account decreased 
$31 billio n on balance over the period.  Reserve 
balances of depository institutions increased $2 billion .  Term deposits remained at $2 billion; 
on September 8, 2010, the Board announced a 
program of regular small -value TDF auctions 
that will offer $5 billion of 28-day deposits about 
every other month.

1 The September survey collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three months in 
credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over -the-counter derivatives markets.  In addition to 
the core set of questions, this survey included a set of special qu estions about changes in funding conditions 
in the commercial mortgage -backed securities and commercial real estate markets since the beginning of 
2010.  A second  set of special questions focused on funding conditions in the collateralized loan obligation  
and bank loan markets.  A final special question asked about respondents’ assessment s of changes in their 
clients’ appetite to bear risk since the beginning of 2010 and over the past three months.  The 
20 institutions participating in the survey account for almost all of the dealer financing of dollar -
denominated securities to nondealers and are the most active intermediaries in the over -the-counter  
derivatives markets.  The survey was conducted during the period from August 16, 2010, to September  3, 
2010.  The core questions ask about changes between June 2010 and  August 2010.   
2 For questions that ask about credit terms , reported net percentages equal the percentage of institutions  
that reported tightening terms  (“tightened considerably ” or “tightened somewhat ”) minus the percentage of 
institutions  that reported loosen ing terms (“loosened considerably ” or “loosened somewhat ”).  For 
questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the percentage of institutions  that reported 
increased  demand ( “increased considerably” or “increased somewhat”) minus the percentage of institutions  
that reported decreased  demand ( “decreased considerably” or “decreased somewhat”).

Appendix  
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms   
Overall, the responses to the September 2010 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on 
Dealer Financing Terms indicate d an easing in credit terms with respect to counterparty 
relationships and securities financing transactions over the previous three months.1  Dealers also 
noted an increase in demand for funding for most types of securities.  By contrast, respondents 
reported little change in the terms and conditions prevalent in over-the-counter ( OTC ) derivatives 
markets over the reference period.2
• Deale
rs indicated that they had loosened credit terms offered to each of the distinct 
classes of counterparties—including hedge funds and other private pools of capital, insurance companies and other institutional investors, and nonfinancial firms —
considering all transaction types covered in the survey.  Respondents also noted an 
increase in the intensity of efforts by each class of c lient to negotiate more- favorable 
terms.   Modest net fractions of dealers suggested that they expected terms applicable to 
hedge funds and other similar private pools of capital and to insurance companies and 
other institutional investors to ease over the coming three months.  
• Only a few respondents to the September survey indicated that they had increased the 
amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated credit 
exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries, a notable contrast to results from 
the June survey in which more than one-half of the respondents reported doing so.

• Responses to questions about OTC derivatives transactions suggested that nonprice terms 
were little changed across different types of underlyi ng asset classes (underlyings) , 
including those for both “plain vanilla” and customized derivatives.  
• With respect to securities financing transactions, respondents reported an easing of terms 
applicable to the funding of several types of collateral.  Deal ers also noted that demand 
for funding for most types of securities had increased, although to a somewhat smaller 
degree than in the June survey.   
• Responses to special questions about funding of commercial mortgage -backed securities 
(CMBS ) and warehousing of commercial real estate ( CRE ) loans  for securitization  
pointed to an easing of conditions and renewed investor interest in these markets since 
the beginning of 2010.  R esponses to special questions about funding of collateralized 
loan obligations ( CLOs ) and warehousing of bank loans for securitization suggested that 
investor demand for these instruments has increased over the same period .  Terms on 
warehouse funding were reportedly eased , on net, since the beginning of 2010.   
• Dealer responses to a special question regarding their overall assessments of changes in their clients’ appetite to bear risk since the beginning of the year and over the past three 
months were mixed .  Among the nine largest firms, a majority reported a decrease in 
client risk appetite since the start of the year and over the past three months.   
 COUNTERPARTY TYPES  
Dealers and other financial intermediaries  
The vast majority of respondents reported that the amount of resources and attention 
devoted to management of concentrate d exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries 
had remained basically unchanged over the past three months, with only two institutions pointing to an increase in this activity.  By contrast, in the June survey, over one-half of the institutions 
had reported an increase in the resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated 
credit exposures to these counterparties.  Most respondents to the September survey also noted 
that the volume of mark and collateral disputes with dealers and ot her financial intermediaries 
had remained basically unchanged over the previous three months. 
Hedge funds, private equity firms, and other similar pools of capital 
As in the June survey, the responses indicated that across all types of transactions 
covered  in the survey, dealers provided somewhat more- favorable credit terms over the past three 
months to hedge funds, private equity firms, and other similar private pools of capital (private 
pools of capital).  A small net fraction of respondents eased price terms, which include most 
importantly financing rates.  One -fourth of institutions reported having eased nonprice terms, 
which include haircuts, maximum maturity, covenants, cure periods, and cross-default provisions or other documentation features.  The institutions that reported an easing of terms pointed to an

improvement in the current or  expected financial strength of counterparties, more -aggressive 
competition from other institutions, and improvement in general market liquidity and functioning 
as the main reasons for having done so.3  One -half of the respondents to the September survey 
noted an increase in the intensity of efforts by private pools of capital to negotia te more -favorable 
price and nonprice terms over the past three months.  Looking forward over the next three 
months, while most dealers expected price and nonprice terms for private pools of capital  to 
remain about unchanged, a modest net fraction of respondents  indicated that they anticipate 
somewhat looser terms.  This development marks a shift from the results of the previous survey, 
in which a small net portion of dealers had anticipated somewhat tighter terms.  
Insurance companies, pension funds, and other institutional investors  
Th
e survey indicated that dealers also provided more-favorable credit terms  for insurance 
companies, pension funds, and other institutional investors (institutional investors) .  A small net 
fraction of respondents reported having eased price terms over the past thre e months, while one-
fourth indicated that they had eased nonprice terms.  The most important reasons cited for easing 
terms were more- aggressive competition from other institutions and improvements in market 
liquidity and functioning.  Nearly one-half of the dealers reported an increase in the intensity of 
efforts by ins titutional investors to negotiate more- favorable price and nonprice terms over the 
past three months.  Looking forward over the next three months, one-fourth of respondents, on net, expected credit terms applicable to institutional investors to ease somewhat.  By contrast, in 
the June survey, the number of dealers that expected terms to ease had been roughly balanced by the number expecting terms to tighten. 
Nonfinancial corporations 
The resp onses to questions about credit terms applicable to nonfinancial corporations also 
pointed to an easing over the past three months.  A small portion of respondents, on balance, indicated that they had eased price terms, while one-fifth noted that they had eased nonprice 
terms.  The three factors that exerted the greatest influence on dealers’ lending policies toward 
nonfinancial corporations over the past three months included more- aggressive competition from 
other firms , improvements in the current or expe cted financial strength of counterparties, and 
improvement in general market liquidity and functioning.  About one- third of respondents 
indicated that there had been an increase in the intensity of efforts by nonfinancial corporations to 
negotia te more -favorable price and nonprice terms over the past three months.  Looking forward 
over the next three months, the vast majority of dealers noted that they expected credit terms to remain basically unchanged.  In the June survey, by contrast, dealers had anticipated, on balance, 
a further loosening of the terms in their transactions with nonfinancial corporations. 
                                                  
4 In this survey, securities financing includes lending to clients collateralized by high -grade corporate 
bonds, equities, agency residential mortgage -backed securities, and other asset -backed securities.  
5 The pace at which borrowers repaid loans to finance ABS and legacy CMBS extended under the 
Term Asset -Backed Securities Loan Facility stepped up notably in recent weeks , reportedly  reflecting in 
part the improved terms on which alternative financing was available.

OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES  
As in the June survey, responses to questions dealing with OTC derivatives trades 
pointed to little change over the past three months in the terms for “ plain vanilla ” and customized 
derivatives across the various underlyings— foreign exchange, interest rate s, equities, credit, 
commodities, and total return swaps referencing nonsecurities (such as mortgages and other bank 
loans).  Of note, however, about one-fifth, on balance, of the dealers active in OTC foreign 
exchange derivative markets reported an increase in the volume of mark and collateral disputes 
with clients over the past three months.  Small net fractions of respondents active in OTC interest 
rate derivatives and OTC equity derivative markets also reported an increase in the volume of 
such disputes with clients . 
SECURITIES FINANCING  
In the September survey, responses to questions focused on securities financing pointed 
to somewhat easier terms under which a broad spectrum of securities were being funded.4  This 
reported loosening of terms was generally evident for both average clients and most favored clients.  With regard to terms under which high-grade corporate bonds are funded, net share s of 
survey respondents ranging between 13 and 33 percent reported a decline in the financing rate; an extensio n in the maximum maturity ; an increase in the maximum amount of funding ; and an 
easing of requirements, timelines, and thresholds for posting additional collateral or margin.  With respect to terms under which equities are funded (including through stock l oans), net 
fractions of dealers  ranging between 10 and 21 percent indicated that they had increased the 
maximum amount of funding, decreased the financing rate, and extended the maximum maturity 
of funding they would provide.  Regarding terms under which agency residential mortgage -
backed securities (RMBS ) are funded, 24 percent of respondents noted that they had lowered the 
financing rate and 12 percent had decreased haircuts.  Finally, with respect to terms under which 
asset -backed securities (ABS ) other than agency RMBS are funded, net fractions of dealers, 
ranging between 15 and 38 percent, reported a decline in the financing rate, a decrease in 
haircuts, an easing of covenants and triggers, and an increase in the maximum amount of 
funding.
5  T
his general trend toward an easing of dealer lending policies with regard to securities 
financing that emerged from the September survey contrast s with the results of the previous 
survey, in which broad trends regarding changes in terms had been more difficult to discern. 
Survey respondents reported that demand for funding for most types of securities had 
increased over the past three months, although the net fractions so reporting were somewhat 
smaller than in the June survey.  On balance, nearly one-third of respondents that lend against 
agency RMBS and about one-fourth of dealers that lend against high-grade corporate bonds and 
                                                   
6 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
marke t for the underlying collateral to be funded through repurchase agreements and similar secured 
financing transactions, not changes in the funding market itself.

ABS other than agency RMBS reported an increase in demand for funding.  By contrast, demand 
for fund ing of equities was little changed on net. 
Forty percent of survey respondents indicated that liquidity and functioning in the high-
grade corporate bond market had improved somewhat over the past three months.6  By
 contrast, 
the vast majority of dealers reported little change in liquidity and functioning in the agency 
RMBS market and in the other ABS market s.  
Survey respondents generally reported little change in the volume of collateral and mark 
disputes with clients related to the funding of collateral of all types .   
SPECIAL  QUESTIONS ON THE FINANCING OF CMBS  AND CLO S 
Responses to special questions about the funding of CMBS and CRE loans pointed to an 
easing of conditions and renewed investor interest in these markets since the beginning of 2010, consist ent with other available evidence.  Among those dealers that have provided funding for 
CMBS over this period, two-thirds reported that they had eased somewhat the terms under which CMBS are funded.  Eighty percent of respondents also indicated that demand for funding of 
CMBS increased over the same period.  About three- quarters of dealers indicated that their 
willingness to fund CRE loans on an interim basis , through warehouse facilities intended to allow 
the accumulation of assets for eventual securitizati on, had increased somewhat since the 
beginning of 2010.  T erms for such funding were unchanged on net.  All respondents but one 
reported that demand for funding of CRE loans on an interim basis had increased over the same period.  Among dealers with materi al activity in the CMBS market, three -fourths indicated that 
liquidity and functioning in that market had improved since the beginning of 2010, with one-
fourth of the respondents noting that this improvement had been considerable.   
Responses to special qu estions about the funding of CLOs and bank loans suggested that 
investor interest in  these instruments also increased since the beginning of 2010.  Nearly one-half 
of the dealers that provided funding for CLOs over this period reported that demand increase d 
somewhat, despite the fact that the terms under which CLOs were funded were unchanged on 
balance.  A similar net fraction of respondents also indicated that demand for funding of bank 
loans on an interim basis, through warehouse financing intended to allow for accumulation of 
assets for eventual securitization, had increased since the beginning of 2010.  This increase 
occurred amid some easing of terms for this interim funding over the same period.  Dealers ’ 
willingness to fund such loans on an interim basis was also about unchanged, on balance.  Among dealers with material activity in the CLO market, all respondents but one indicated that liquidity 
and functioning had improved since the beginning of 2010.

SPECIAL QUES TION ON DEALER ’S ASSESSMENTS OF  CHANGES IN THE IR 
CLIENTS ’  APPETITE TO BEAR RISK 
Overall dealer responses regarding their assessments of changes in their clients’ appetite 
to bear risk were mixed.  Relative to the beginning of 2010, 40 percent of respondents indicated 
that their clients’ app etite to bear risk had decreased, 35 percent noted that it had remained 
basically unchanged, and the remain ing 25 percent suggested that it had increased somewhat.  
When considering changes over the past three months, one- half of the respondents reported that 
their clients’ appetite to bear risk had remained basically unchanged, 30 percent indicated that it 
had decreased somewhat, and 20 percent noted that it had increased somewhat . 
Of the nine largest firms, all of which engage in activities spanning the full range of 
counterparty and transaction types, seven reported a decrease in client risk appetite since the start of the year.  Over the past three months, five of the se nine large  firms reported that risk appetite 
“decreased somewhat” with the remainder  indicating that appetite remained “basically 
unchanged.”  By contrast, t he remaining firms, which generally engage in activities that do not 
span multiple counterparty or transaction types, reported a net increase in their clients' appetite to bear risk.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the ri sks to the outlook, we consider  a number of alternatives 
to the baseline projection using simulations of  staff models.  In the first scenario, we 
consider the possibility that we have overre acted to the recent weakness in a range of 
inherently noisy indicators and that the econom y is on track for a str onger recovery than 
in the baseline.  The second scenario considers the contrasting risk  that the generally 
downbeat tone of recent readings on activity instead points to an even more sluggish 
recovery than we are projecting.  The third scenario considers another possible source of 
greater weakness in the real ec onomy:  less-favorable supply -side conditions that imply 
lower permanent income.  We then turn to  opposing risks to the inflation outlook—either 
that continued weakness in hourly compensation will damp overall price gains or that inflation will come in noticeably above our  baseline projections, as most private 
forecasters expect.  The final scenario consider s the risk of weaker real activity abroad 
and a stronger dollar relative to the baseline projection.   
In these scenarios, monetary policy res ponds to movements in real activity and 
inflation as prescribed by a simple policy rule for the federal funds rate; nontraditional policy follows the baseline path.  We generate  the first five scenarios using the FRB/US 
model and the policy rule deta iled in the long-term outlook discussion in the “Domestic 
Economic Developments and Outlook” section.  The last scenario, however, is generated 
using the multicountry SIGMA model, which us es a somewhat different policy rule for 
the federal funds rate that employs an a lternative concept of resource utilization.

Stronger Recovery 
On balance, the data we have received since the spring have led us to mark down 
the forecast.  However, such indicators are inherently noisy and could be misleading us; 
in particular, the recent downbeat readings may prove to be more transitory than we have assumed.  In light of this possibility, this  scenario examines a sharper snapback in 
spending on consumer durables and in cap ital expenditure, reflecting a mutually

  reinforcing dynamic of improved optimism,  higher spending, greater hiring, and 
increasing credit availability—developments th at would be more in line with the contour 
of our projection in the spring.  The stronger activity in turn buoys financial markets, and 
equity prices are 11 percent above baseline by the end of next year; financial conditions 
improve further into 2012.  The virtuous ci rcle causes real GDP to expand 5 percent on 
average in 2011 and 2012, bringing the unemploym ent rate down to 7 percent by the end 
of 2012.  With less slack, infla tion is higher; however, the up ward pressure is partially 
checked by more capital deepening and thus larger productivity ga ins.  Under these 
conditions, the federal funds rate begins to rise in late 2011 and remains above baseline 
thereafter. 
Weaker Recovery 
The weak tone of data since the spring suggests the recovery is having difficulty 
gaining traction.  In this s cenario, the modest projected improvements in confidence, 
credit conditions, and the labor market underlyi ng our baseline are dela yed even further.  
In response, households deleverage more a ggressively, pushing the saving rate to  
7¾ percent by the end of 2012, while firms are more reluctant to boost capital spending.  
In addition, the sluggish pace of recovery leads to a reassessment of the outlook for 
earnings and the riskiness of equity holdi ngs, causing equity pr ices to fall about 
10 percent relative to the baseli ne by next year.  In this e nvironment, real GDP expands at 
an average annual rate of only 1½ percent through the end of next year.  In turn, labor 
market conditions stagnate, and the unemploy ment rate hovers near 9¾ percent through 
the end of 2011.  Inflation falls in response to  more persistent slack and remains below 
baseline through 2015.  Under these conditions, liftoff of the federal funds rate from its 
effective lower bound is delayed until the middle of 2014.   
Lower Potential 
The pace of the recovery could also turn out to be unexpectedly slow if we have 
overestimated the economy’s pr oductive potential, gi ven that less-favorable supply-side 
conditions would imply lower long-run levels  of real household income and corporate 
earnings.  While we raised the NAIRU and lo wered potential output this round, there is 
considerable uncertainty around our estimates ; given the extremely high level of long-
duration unemployment and the unprecedented dist urbances to the financial system, it is 
possible that we have not revised them e nough.  Indeed, some outside forecasters have 
noticeably lower estimates of potential output, and thus less slack.  In this scenario, we 
assume that output is currently 4 percent below potential rather than the baseline estimate

  of 7 percent, reflecting both a higher NAIRU and a lower leve l of structural productivity.  
The lower long-run levels of household inco me and corporate earnings implied by this 
assumption, and their effects on consumption and investment, cause real GDP to expand 
about 1 percentage point less per year, on aver age, through 2015 than in the baseline; the 
unemployment rate also declines more slowly.  In addition, inflation picks up sooner than 
in the baseline, with core PCE prices rising about ½ percentage point  faster than in the 
baseline from 2011 through 2015, reflecting both the direct effects of lower productivity 
on firms’ costs and a smaller margin of slack.  Over time, policymakers take on board the 
evidence of less-favorable supply-side conditi ons, and monetary policy begins tightening 
in the middle of next year.   
Wage Stagnation 
In the baseline projection, compensation per hour rises at an a nnual rate of close 
to 2 percent on average over the rest of this year and 2011.  However, the Productivity 
and Cost measure of hourly compensation is now estimated to have fallen in the first half of this year, suggesting a downside risk.  In this scenario, we assume that compensation 
per hour remains flat through the end of 2011 a nd that nominal wage gains remain below 
baseline until 2013.  In the face of reduced co st pressures, core PCE inflation falls to 
about ½ percent in 2011, 2012, and 2013 and doe s not climb above 1 percent until 2015.  
These developments also translate into lowe r labor income and higher corporate profits; 
on net, these shifts in income work to damp  aggregate demand.  With lower inflation and 
a bit more slack, the federal funds rate lif ts off its effective lower bound two quarters 
later than in the baseline.   
Higher Inflation 
Many outside forecasters anticipate higher in flation than in the staff projection.  
The “Lower Potential” scenario described one  set of factors that could lead to higher 
inflation than in the staff’s projection, but there are other reasons why prices could rise 
faster than we anticipate.  For example, we may be taking too much signal from the 
recent low levels of inflation, with the cons equence that the deceleration in underlying 
inflation may have been more modest than  we have implicitly  assumed.  Another 
possibility is that the accel eration in activity to above-t rend growth will place more 
upward pressure on inflation than we expect through “speed effects,” with commodity and other prices reacting to the rate of change  in activity.  In this scenario, these factors 
cause inflation to follow a path consistent wi th outside forecasters’ consensus, which we 
read as anticipating core PCE inflation of about  1½ percent next year.  In the face of this 
 
                                                 
2 The August Blue Chip survey was released about a week after publication of the August Tealbook, 
and so survey respondents at the time were working with information broadly similar to that incorporated 
in the last Tealbook.

  higher inflation, the policy rule prescribes raising the federal funds rate starting in late 
2011, about a year earlier than in the baseline an d closer to the interest  rate projections of 
some outside forecasters.  The tighter moneta ry policy tempers aggregate demand, so real 
GDP expands somewhat more slowly than in the baseline. 
Weaker Activity Abroad 
In the Tealbook baseline, we project fore ign economic growth to moderate from 
its pace in the first half of th is year, albeit to a still solid  rate of expansion; we also 
anticipate moderate depreciati on of the dollar against foreign currencies.  However, 
growth abroad could slow more sharply than we anticipate, particularly in emerging Asia, 
where recent data point to a marked softeni ng in the pace of economic activity.  In this 
scenario, we assume that weaker private de mand abroad causes GDP growth to fall short 
of baseline by 1½ percentage points over the next two years in emerging market 
economies and by 1 percentage point in advan ced foreign economies.   In addition, the 
trade-weighted dollar appreciates  about 8 percen t relative to baseline by the first half of 
2012, with this appreciation concentrated against the currencies of the emerging 
economies.  In this simulation, U.S. r eal GDP growth falls below baseline by 
1 percentage point in 2011 and ¾ percentage point in 2012, as real ne t exports decline.  
Core PCE inflation dips ½ pe rcentage point below baseline in 2011 in response to lower 
import prices and lower resource utilization.  The liftoff of the federal funds rate is 
delayed to mid-2013.  Eventually, real GDP gr owth rises above baseline because of the 
greater monetary accommodation and a gra dual improvement in economic growth 
abroad. 
OUTSIDE FORECASTS  
 The Blue Chip consensus forecast releas ed in early September shows real GDP 
increasing at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the second half of 2010 and 2.9 percent 
in 2011.  The consensus projection for the seco nd half of this year is down about ½ 
percentage point from the August survey, while the forecast for next year is down just 
0.1 percentage point.2  The consensus for real GDP growth is about the same as the 
staff’s outlook for the second half of this year  but weaker next year.  Despite a somewhat 
weaker forecast for real GDP growth, th e Blue Chip consensus forecast for the

  unemployment rate at the end of 2011 is a to uch below the staff’s projection.  Regarding 
inflation, the Blue Chip consensus antici pates the CPI increasi ng 1.7 percent over the 
four quarters of 2011, the same as its projecti on from a month earlier and higher than the 
staff forecast of 1.2 percent.  Finally, the Bl ue Chip consensus forecasts for both short- 
and long-term interest rates have move d down noticeably since August and are now 
closer to the sta ff assumptions.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the
NAIRU. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionarychanges in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The annual FI estimates are on a calendar year basis. Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicateaggregate demand stimulus.
