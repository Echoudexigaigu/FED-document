Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information that we have received in  recent weeks suggests that the economic 
recovery is proceeding at a subpar pace, as we had envisioned in the September 
Tealbook.  In the labor market, private nonfarm employment growth remained sluggish in 
September, the unemployment rate held stea dy at 9.6 percent, and other indicators of 
labor market activity appear consistent with only lackluster employment gains through 
year-end.  In the housing market, both home sa les and housing starts have remained weak 
in recent months.  And, although indicators for business investment in equipment and software and for consumer spending have been  stronger than we had expected at the time 
of the September Tealbook, the pickup in dema nd has thus far been met in large part 
through higher imports rather than through an  increase in domestic  production.  Indeed, 
the most recent indicators of industrial productio n (IP) have been a little softer than we 
had anticipated, and we now expect IP to post a small decline in the current quarter, 
compared with our previous forecast of a sli ght gain.  Putting all of this information 
together, we project that real  GDP will rise at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second 
half of this year—the same as our September projection.  
In this projection, we have assumed that the FOMC will announce its intention at 
the close of the upcoming meeting to purchas e an additional $600 b illion of Treasury 
securities.  As a result, we foresee financia l conditions that should be more supportive of 
economic growth over the medium term.  Co mpared with the September projection, we 
have assumed lower long-term interest rates,  higher stock prices, and a lower foreign 
exchange value of the dollar.  Taken together, these factors support additional growth of real GDP of about ¼ percentage point in each of 2011 and 2012, putting the increases in 
those years at about 3½ percen t and 4¾ percent respectively.  In this environment, we 
project that the unemployment rate will fall to 9 percent at the end of 2011 and to a little 
below 8 percent at the end of 2012. 
Our projection for inflation is little changed from the last Tealbook.  Although 
recent readings for core consumer price infla tion have come in a little lower than we had 
been expecting, the stronger real activity and higher import prices in  this projection point 
to a little less disinflationa ry pressure going forward.  As a result, we now project that 
core PCE inflation will edge down from 1.1 percent this year to 1.0 percent in both 2011 and 2012—a touch higher than our September pr ojection.  With energy prices expected to

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
As in the September Tealbook, we continue  to assume that the FOMC will hold 
the target federal funds rate in  the current range of 0 to ¼ percent until the fourth quarter 
of 2012.  However, we now assume that the FOMC will introduce further policy 
accommodation through additional purchases of Tr easury securities.  In particular, we 
assume the Committee will purchase about an a dditional $75 billion of intermediate- and 
long-term Treasury securities per month through next June, putting the cumulative increment to the balance sheet at $600 bill ion; as of the September Tealbook, we had 
assumed no such additional purchases.  Market participants appear to be quite uncertain 
about the timing and ultimate size of the presum ed expansion of the System Open Market 
Account (SOMA).  On balance, though, they ap pear to expect a larger program than we 
have assumed.  Consequently, as it becomes apparent over the course of the first half of 
next year that the Committee will not exte nd the balance sheet beyond $600 billion, we 
anticipate that the market will gradually give up some of the incremental improvement in 
financial conditions that has accrued during the past  couple of months.   
Financial Conditions 
As of October 26, the 10-year Treasury yield was about unchanged compared 
with the time of the Septembe r Tealbook; in the previous Tealbook we had expected the 
yield to increase noticeably during the same peri od.  After factoring in the possibility of a 
favorable market reaction to the Comm ittee’s announcement—reflecting in part a 
resolution of uncertainty—the 10-year Treasury yield in the fourth quarter is expected to 
average about 30 basis points below the Se ptember Tealbook.  (The Box “Alternative 
SOMA Portfolio Assumptions” discusses the economic effects of alternative paths for 
asset purchases.) 
Looking forward, we assume that the eff ect of these additional purchases on the 
10-year Treasury yield will diminish over ti me, in part reflecting the assumed market 
disappointment next year rela tive to expectations about the cumulative increment to 
SOMA holdings.  Consequently, while the proj ected path of Treasur y yields is lower 
throughout the forecast period, it is somewhat steeper than in the September Tealbook, 
rising from the current level of about 2¾ pe rcent to about 4¼ percent by the end of 2012.

PercentAlternative  SOMA Portfolio  Assumptions 
The staff’s  baseline forecast  assumes  that the Federal Reserve will increase its  
holdings of longer‐term securities  by $600 billion,  and that the additional  
purchases  will be completed  by next June.  We expect that investors  will be 
somewhat  disappointed  when the  Committee takes  no further action at 
subsequent  meetings, a reaction  that causes some additional  upward pressure  
on long‐term yields during  the first half of next year.   
Here we cons ider the 
effects of two alternative scenarios  for asset  purchases.    In 
the first alternative,  called “no additional  expansion,”  the Committee  announces  
that it will maintain the  Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at  its current level 
through 2012, thereby greatly surprising  market participants.   In the second 
alternative,  called “larger portfolio expansion,”  the FOMC instead announces  
that it will increase  the size of the balance sheet by  $1 trillion by the end of next 
year—a policy that would not entail the  disappointment  during the first half of 
next year that  we envision occurring  under the baseline policy.  In both 
alternative  scenarios, market  participants expect  that no further expansions  of 
the balance sheet will be  announced  after November.  The  paths for the size of 
the SOMA portfolio in  the baseline and in the alternative scenarios  are shown in  
the figure in the lower left.  
For purposes  of this 
simulation,  we assume that market participants currently  
expect a cumulative increase  in the SOMA of roughly $1 trillion.   Accordingly, an 
announcement  that no further asset  purchases  will be forthcoming  would likely 
cause long ‐term interest rates to jump 30 to 40 basis points.  Although  such 
estimates  are uncertain,  this response  would be in line with research on  the 
effects of the earlier large ‐scale asset programs.   The figure  in the lower right 
shows the effect of this announcement  regarding  the no‐additional ‐expansion  
policy.  Going forward,  the gap between yields under this  strategy and the 
baseline policy narrows,  in part because the  baseline incorporates  a backup  in 
yields next  year as market participants  come to realize  that the baseline policy 
involves only $600 billion  in purchases,  not $1 trillion.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookIn contrast  to the no‐additional ‐expansion  policy, we assume that the 
implementation  of the larger program  of additional  asset purchases  would 
largely accord with current  market expectations.   Therefore,  as  indicated  by the 
green line  in the figure on the lower right  on the facing page, this policy would 
prevent the backup in term premiums that  the baseline forecast anticipates  for 
next year, and  thus would provide a modest  amount of additional  monetary  
stimulus over time.  
The figures  below illustrate  the implications  for real GDP and the unemployment  
rate of the alternative portfolio  strategies, based  on simulations  of the FRB/US 
model in which the federal  funds rate follows  the baseline path through 2015.  In  
the no‐additional ‐expansion  scenario,  the less favorable  financial conditions  
induced by higher long‐term interest rates (including  lower equity  prices and a 
higher foreign exchange  value of the dollar) restrain aggregate  demand.   As a 
result, the  level of real GDP  is 0.7 percent below baseline by the end of 2012, 
while the unemployment  rate is 0.3 percentage point  higher.   In the larger‐
portfolio‐expansion  scenario,  by contrast,  the additional  monetary  stimulus 
provided  by the policy results in modestly  more favorable  financial conditions,  so 
that the level  of real GDP is  0.4 percent above baseline  by late 2012.   
FRB/US simulations  suggest that the price implications  of pursuing  either of the 
two alternative  portfolio strategies  would likely be small.  For example,  the 
model predicts  that, without any further expansion,  inflation would decline 
relative to baseline  by only 0.1 percentage  point at most.  However, this  result 
hinges on the assumption  that agents’ expectations  for long‐run inflation would  
not be materially  altered by changes in the balance sheet  of the magnitude 
considered  here.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookAs in the previous projection, several othe r factors contribute to this contour, but, 
quantitatively, the most important is the movement of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of ne ar-zero short-term interest rates.   
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have declined a bit since mid-
Septem
ber, and their spreads to comparable-maturity Treasury yields have narrowed a 
touch.  Spreads on conforming fixed-rate mort gages also have changed little in recent 
weeks.  Consistent with these small changes to  interest rate spreads, the projected paths 
for corporate bond yields and conforming mortgage s have been revised about in line with 
the projected path for the 10-year Treasury yield. 
The Dow Jones U.S. Stock Market Index is about 5½ percent above the level 
anticipated in the September Tealbook.  In the medium term, the expected 
disappointment in financial markets about th e size of the SOMA purchase program is 
projected to tamp down share price appreciation.  Nonetheles s, with the equity premium 
remaining above longer-run norms, we continue  to expect stock pr ices to increase 
markedly over the next couple of years, aver aging about 12½ percent at an annual rate—
enough to bring the implied equity premium down toward a more typical level. 
Readings on house prices have been a bit weaker than expected in the September 
Tealbook.  The CoreLogic repeat sales index de creased in August, leading us to m
ark 
down our forecast for the level of house prices by roughly 1 percent.  With a broad range 
of factors—including weak housing demand a nd sizable foreclosure volumes—likely to 
weigh on the housing market in coming quarters, we project ho me prices to be flat, on 
net, through 2012.  In the baseline projection, we have assumed that the net effect of 
irregularities in various aspects of mortgage servicing and securiti zation practices will be 
small; however, the downside risks posed by this situation are substantial.  (See the box 
“The Economic Effects of the Mortgage Documentation Problems” for more detail.)  
Fiscal Policy 
We made a few small changes to our a ssumptions about federal fiscal policy.  
First, we now assume that the provisions  of the 2001–03 tax cuts for high-income 
individuals will be extended through 2012 (previously, we had assumed that only the cuts 
for non-high-income individuals would be extended), but that the Make Work Pay tax credit will expire at the end of 2010.  Thes e changes, on net, do not have any material 
effect on our projections of  disposable personal income and household spending.  
Second, we have incorporated  the bonus depreciation provi sion for investment spending 
   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
October 27, 2010
Page 7 of 104
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookby firms in 2010, which was part of the recently enacted legislation for small businesses.  
We anticipate that this provision will result in a very small amount of business spending 
on equipment being pulled forward from the first quarter of next year into the fourth 
quarter of this year.  In all,  these changes have essentially  no effect on our projection of 
fiscal impetus; we continue to project that federal fiscal policy actions will provide a small boost to aggregate demand in the second ha lf of this year, but that they will hold 
down GDP growth by about ½ pe rcentage point per year in 2011 and 2012 as the effects 
of stimulus policies wane. 
Our forecast for the unified budget is roughly the same as in the September 
projection.  The budget deficit ended fiscal  year 2010 at about $1.3 trillion (alm 
ost 
9 percent of GDP), and we expect it to rema in at about that level in fiscal 2011.  The 
budget deficit is anticipated to  narrow to about $1 trillion in fiscal 2012 (approximately 
6½ percent of GDP), primarily reflecting the budgetary effects of the continuing 
economic recovery and the winding dow n of stimulus-related spending.   
Foreign Activity and the Dollar  
Recent indicators of foreign economic activity have, on balance, been a bit 
weaker than we had expected, leading us to mark down our estimate for foreign GDP 
growth ¼ percentage point in the second half  of the year.  Ther eafter, the outlook for 
foreign real activity is lit tle changed, on net, as the ne gative effect of currency 
appreciation in some countries  is largely offset by the upwar d revision to U.S. demand.  
We now project that real economic growth ab road will slow from an annual rate of 
5½ percent in the first half of this year to 2½ percent in the second half, as the boost from 
the recovery in global trad e, manufacturing, and invent ories has waned.  In 2011 and 
2012, we expect that foreign economic growth  will pick up to roughly a 3½ percent pace 
as a gradual revival in priv ate spending more than offs ets a withdrawal of policy 
stimulus. 
The dollar has depreciated 2½ percent on a trade-weighted basis against a broad 
set of currencies since the September forecas t, spurred in large pa rt by anticipation of 
further policy accommodation from the Federal Reserve.  In line with this drop in the 
dollar, our projection for the br oad real dollar in the current quarter is nearly 3 percent 
below the September Tealbook.  We project that the dollar will depreciate at a rate of 
about 2½ percent per year over 2011 and 2012, a slightly slower rate than in the September forecast.  Market expectations for the federal funds rate have come down 
toward the staff projection, so we are no longe r expecting markets to be surprised by the

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookEconomic  Effects  of the Mortgage  Documentation  Problems  
A number of mortgage  servicers,  banks, and mortgage ‐backed securities  (MBS) issuers 
appear to have mishandled  important  procedural  steps when transferring  ownership  of 
mortgages.1  In addition,  some mortgage  servicers appear  not to have followed  state 
foreclosure laws  correctly  in some cases.  As  a result, mortgage  servicers are  taking a 
closer look at the paperwork  for loans  currently  in the foreclosure  process and for 
properties  in their inventory  of real estate  owned (REO).  While this  review is under 
way, some servicers have  put a selective  freeze on foreclosure ‐related proceedings and  
sales of REO.   
These mortgage  market developments  cloud the outlook for housing  activity and raise 
some potentially  daunting  legal issues for financial institutions.   At this point, much is 
unknown  about how  this story will play out, and the picture is changing  daily.  That 
said, our baseline assumption  at this time is that these problems  will have  only limited 
effects on housing activity and prices, on net, over  the next year.   Of course,  the effects 
could be more damaging  if the paperwork  problems  persist longer or affect more  loans 
than we currently  expect.  And a number  of other potential  outcomes,  although  
seemingly  improbable at the moment,  pose notable  downside  risks.  
Regarding  the factors incorporated  in the baseline  staff forecast,  we assume that 
servicers will  delay the transition  of foreclosed  properties  to REO for a short time  while 
they shore up their legal claims to mortgages.  In  the baseline,  we anticipate  that the 
foreclosure process  will be extended  by an average  of three months—an  assumption  
that is within  the range of  estimates  provided  by banks and more‐pessimistic  analysts.   
In addition,  we expect the flow of new foreclosure  filings to lessen  significantly  as 
servicers focus  on internal document  controls,  simultaneously  reducing  new 
foreclosure starts  and expanding  the number of delinquent  loans.   However, most  
loans that are seriously  delinquent  or already in the foreclosure  inventory  will become  
REO eventually.   Because  home buyers have an incentive  to look ahead and recognize  
that future supply, we  expect home prices  to be little  affected by the longer 
foreclosure process  and the slowdown  in new foreclosures.  The effect  of this delay on 
home sales  is also likely to be slight, because the rate  of new foreclosures  is small 
relative to the stock  of homes for sale. 
Our baseline  forecast calls for the freeze  of REO sales to last for three  months, the 
same amount of time for which we  expect foreclosure completions  to be delayed.   We 
expect the stoppage  to affect 50 percent  of REO sales—slightly  more than the fraction 
currently  on hold, to account  for the possibility  that more banks might voluntarily  halt 
sales or that authorities  could forcibly stop REO sales in some states.  As  a result, in  our 
forecast we have shifted some home sales  from the end of 2010 to the first half of 2011, 
with the ensuing swing in brokerage  commissions  having minor transitory  effects on 
real GDP.   Again, the resulting  change to house prices is likely to be small, on net, 
because the  contraction  in the supply of homes for sale is temporary.   
   
                                                  
2 The price of a typical property sold through a short sale is higher than the price of a 
typical property sold as REO.  Thus, selling a home through a short sale rather  than as REO 
should  raise average home prices.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookSome aftereffects  of the mortgage  paperwork  problems  are likely to be long lasting.  
First, for some  properties  in foreclosure  for which the  borrower has  already returned  
the keys, the determination  of legal title could be so difficult that  the property  remains 
vacant for a long  time.  Such properties  are likely to be poorly maintained,  so their own 
value could  decline significantly.   In addition,  past experience  suggests  that vacant 
homes could reduce the values of nearby properties.  The prevalence of  such extreme  
title difficulties  is hard to estimate,  but we think it will be small, because in the large 
majority of cases,  the economic  value of a house will be great enough to justify  the 
legal costs of clearing up the title.  Therefore,  in the staff forecast  we assume that this 
channel puts just a little downward pressure  on the prices of existing homes. 
Another potential  long‐lasting effect is that servicers could  become more willing to 
modify delinquent  loans or accept short  sales rather than face the hurdles involved  in 
documenting  that a foreclosure  is legal.  Short sales  and modifications,  unlike 
foreclosures,  involve voluntary  agreements  between  the lender and  borrower and  thus 
circumvent many  of the recent problems.  As  a result, we  assume that a small fraction  
of foreclosures  currently  in process will not be completed,  and that new foreclosure  
starts going forward will be a little lower.  Consequently,  the REO inventory  will be 
smaller, providing  a small amount  of upward pressure  to the staff forecast for house  
prices.2 
In sum,
 we currently  assume in the baseline that the factors discussed  above will have  
little net effect  on home sales,  prices, and construction  activity.  That said, a number  of 
possible developments  that appear unlikely at this juncture could  potentially  have 
significant  negative  effects on housing markets and economic  activity if they were to 
occur: 
 The financial  condition  of mortgage  servicers or  MBS sponsors  (including  a number  
of subsidiarie s of large commercial  banks) could be severely strained  by large‐scale 
lawsuits or by investors  seeking the repurchase of  mortgages.   Facing severe 
funding pressures,  these financial  institutions  could cut back on the supply of

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookpersistence of very low rates— a factor that had been contri buting to a faster depreciation 
of the dollar over the next two years.  Th e anticipated policy disappointment during the 
first half of next year will al so reduce downward  pressure on  the dollar.  On balance, our 
forecast leaves the broad real dollar 2¼ pe rcent lower at the end of 2012 than in the 
September Tealbook. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
The lower dollar and unexpectedly strong readings on global oil consumption 
have combined to push the dollar price of o il higher than we were projecting in the 
September Tealbook.  However, the rise appears to have been tempered by a high level of 
global inventories and ample OPEC spare pr oduction capacity.  Since the time of the 
September Tealbook, the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil has moved up 
more than $5 per barrel, closing most recently on October 26 at $82.55 per barrel.  Prices 
of futures contracts have also  increased, but by lesser amounts.  Consistent with the path 
of futures prices, we now project that the s pot price of WTI will end 2012 at more than 
$88 per barrel, about $2 higher than  in the September projection. 
Dollar-denominated prices for many other commodities have moved considerably 
higher since the September Tealbook.  As with oil, some of these broad-based increases 
relate to the lower value of the dollar.  However, commodity-specific supply conditions 
have provided upward price pressure for some foods and agricultural raw materials.  We 
project that nonfuel commodity prices will in crease at an annual rate in excess of 
30 percent in the current quarter, 20 percentage points above the previous Tealbook.  For 2011 and 2012, consistent with quotes from futures markets, we project nonfuel 
commodity prices to move down slightly. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
The data on domestic economic activity that  we have received since the time of 
the September forecast have been, on balance, close to our expectations.  As a result, we 
continue to project that real GDP will rise at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second half 
of this year. 
Labor Markets 
The pace of recovery in the labor market continues to be sluggish.  Private 
nonfarm employers added only 64,000 jobs in September, similar to the average pace over the preceding four months , and in line with our expe ctations in the September

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookTealbook.1  Meanwhile, the unemployment rate was 9.6 percent in both August and 
September, down just a bit from its average earlier in the year. 
Indicators of labor market activity sugge st that employment growth will remain 
weak in coming months.  Layoff indicators, such as initial clai ms for unemployment 
insurance, have remained elevated.  Mo reover, the average workweek—which often 
moves up ahead of a pickup in hiring—has ch anged little, on ne t, since May, while 
measures of job openings have remained quite low.  As a result, we project that private 
payrolls will increase at an  average monthly pace of 90,000 in the fourth quarter, about 
the same pace as in the third quarter and unc hanged from our forecast in the September 
Tealbook.  With this pace of job growth, we pr oject the unemployment rate to inch up to 
9.7 percent in October and then  hold steady through year-end.  
The Industrial Sector 
After rising at a 7 percent annual rate over the first ha lf of the year, industrial 
production decelerated through the summer and edged down ¼ percent in September, 
leaving the increase for the third quarter as a whole at an annual rate of less than 
5 percent.  In the manufacturing sector, mo tor vehicle output was boosted in the third 
quarter as automakers worked to replenish dealer stocks.  Else where in manufacturing, 
however, output gains slowed across a wide range of industries, as the impetus to 
production from inventory rebuilding di minished.  Looking ahead, we expect 
manufacturing IP to decline at an annual rate  of about 1½ percent in the fourth quarter, as 
automakers pare back assemblies in respons e to the modest outlook for sales, and as 
production outside of motor vehicles continues to be restrained by weak domestic 
demand. 
Household Spending 
Real consumer spending appears to have increased at an annual rate of about 
2½ percent in the third quarter, somewhat faster  than its pace in the first half of the year 
and a little stronger than we had expected  in the September Tealbook.  With gains in 
labor income restrained by the sluggish r ecovery in the labor market, households 
continuing to adjust spending in response to earlier declines in wealth, and consumer 
sentiment still at a depressed level, we exp ect that consumer spending will rise at an

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookannual rate of about 2¼ percent in the current quarter, just  a shade more than in our 
previous projection. 
Housing demand remains quite weak.  We  anticipate that the effects of the 
expiration of the homebuyer tax credit will c ontinue to weigh on home sales through the 
current quarter.  But, even after making allo wances for the tax credit effects, home sales 
appear softer than would be expected in an  environment of record-low mortgage rates 
and house prices that are both low and appare ntly leveling out.  Th e unusual weakness in 
housing demand may reflect a number of in fluences, including the drag on household 
formation from economic uncertainty and anem ic job creation, persis tent concerns about 
the possibility of further house pr ice declines, and c ontinued constraints on the ability of 
some households to obtain mortgage credit.   Adding to the issues plaguing the housing 
market, we expect that the recently a nnounced moratoriums on sales of bank-owned 
properties will depress home sales, on net, through the end of this year.   
As for construction activity, single-family housing starts fell back from an annual 
rate of about 500,000 over the first half of the year to a 440,000 unit pace in the third 
quarter, and the latest readings on adjusted pe rmit issuance point to little improvement in 
the fourth quarter.  All told, we expect reside ntial investment to decline at an annual rate 
of 4¾ percent in the fourth quarter. 
Business Investment 
Real E&S spending appears to have deceler ated noticeably in the second half of 
this year from its exceptional first-half pace.  However, the data we have received since 
the September Tealbook suggest that the slow down will be less striking than we had 
previously expected.  Although the orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods in 
August and September were, on net, about in line with our expecta tions, both imports of 
capital goods and business purchas es of motor vehicles were considerably stronger than 
we had been anticipating.  All told, we now project that E&S spendi ng will increase at an 
average annual rate of 7½ per cent in the second ha lf of this year, compared with our 
September Tealbook projection of  a 2 percent average gain. 
Business outlays on nonresidential structures have continued to move lower, as 
increases in spending on drilli ng and mining structures have been more than offset by 
further declines in building construction.  We  expect high energy pric es to sustain solid 
increases in drilling and mining expenditures through year-end.  In contrast, while the 
downtrend in construction outlays on buildings  appears to have slowed somewhat, the

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookoverhang of unoccupied space and tight lendi ng conditions continue to weigh on this 
sector, and we look for outlays on building construction to decline further in coming 
months. 
  Based on the available monthly indicat ors, we project that real inventory 
investment stepped up sharply in the third quart er after rising at a more moderate pace in 
the second quarter.  Nevertheless, business inventories overall do not appear excessive:  
Inventory–sales ratios in most industries remain well below their recent peaks, and 
survey-based indicators suggest  that most businesses do not pe rceive inventory stocks as 
too high.  Moreover, while the months’ s upply measure in the staff’s flow-of-goods 
system moved up again in September, there is little evidence of  unintended inventory 
accumulation outside of a few scattered industries, such as nonmetallic mineral products, 
primary metals, and machinery.  
Motor vehicle inventories were little changed in September after having risen 
sharply over the summer when automakers boosted production to replenish dealer stocks, 
and production plans for the fourth quarter sugge st that inventories will likely remain 
near their current levels th rough the end of the year.  Outside of motor vehicles, we 
expect stockbuilding to continue at a relativ ely steady pace over the remainder of the year 
as firms increase their inventorie s in line with growth in fina l sales.  For the second half 
of the year as a whole, invent ory investment is expected to  be a roughly neutral influence 
on the rate of change of real GDP.  
Government 
We estimate that real federal purchases rose  at an annual rate of 4¼ percent in the 
third quarter, and anticipate that they will rise at a 3¾ percent pace in the current quarter.  Defense spending is likely to post sizabl e gains in both quarters, while nondefense 
spending is expected to be about flat. 
In the state and local sector, employ ment plunged 54,000 per month, on average, 
in the third quarter, as governments continued to trim payrolls in response to budget pressures.  With much of the decrease co ming in local education employment, we have 
assumed that the outsized job losses last qu arter were largely one-time adjustments to 
payrolls that were completed by the beginni ng of the school year.  As a result, our 
projection calls for state and local employment to  remain about flat in the current quarter.  
In contrast, nominal construc tion outlays have risen noticeab ly in recent months after 
plummeting in late 2009 and early 2010; we expect these outlays to continue to firm in

method of seasonal adjustment. 
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
October 27, 2010
Page 17 of 104
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookthe current quarter.  On net, we expect real state and local purchase s to edge down in both 
the third and fourth quarters of this year. 
Foreign Trade  
 Import data for August showed surprising strength, and we now estimate that real 
imports of goods and services expanded at an annual rate of almost 15 percent in the third 
quarter, with imports of consumer goods a nd capital goods exhibiti ng especially large 
gains.  However, we anticipate that real im ports will fall 3 percent in the current quarter, 
as non-oil imports return to a ra te of growth more consistent  with the projected expansion 
of U.S. activity and oil imports decrease sharply.2  The export data in the August trade 
release were weaker than we had expected, and suggest that the cy clical recovery in 
exports may have paused in the third quarter.  We now estimate that the growth in real 
exports of goods and services stepped down to  an annual rate of 5¾ percent in the third 
quarter, about half the pace in the September Tealbook.  In the current quarter, we expect 
real export growth to move back up to an a nnual rate of 9½ percent,  consistent with the 
recent declines in the dollar, the expansion of foreign demand, and the resumption of some further cyclical bounceback from the steep  declines in exports registered during the 
global recession. 
All told, net exports are estimated to have subtracted 1½ percentage points from 
real GDP growth in the third quarter versus  our September projection that net exports 
would be about neutral for GDP growth.  For th e current quarter, we e xpect net exports to 
contribute 1½ percentage point s to GDP growth, ½ percentage  point more than in the 
September Tealbook.  The upward revision stems from the lower value of the dollar and 
from our expectation that some of the third- quarter surprises to im ports and exports will 
be reversed. 
Prices and Wages 
Core inflation has remained low.  The core PCE price index increased 0.1 percent 
in August, and our translation of the CPI and PPI data suggest s that core PCE prices were 
unchanged in September—a touch weaker th an we had anticipated.  Based on these 
readings, we estimate that core PCE prices fo r the third quarter as a whole rose at an 
annual rate of 1 percent, about the same as the rate posted in the first half of 2010.  In the 
current quarter, we anticipate somewhat more  upward pressure on core consumer prices 
coming from higher import prices.  Indeed, we look for prices of co re imports (all goods 
   
   
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
October 27, 2010
Page 18 of 104
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookexcluding fuels, computers, and semiconductors ) to rise at an a nnual rate of almost 
5 percent this quarter.  But, after factoring in  the implications of the low readings on core
inflation in August and September, we continue to project core PCE prices to rise at a bit 
more than a 1 percent rate this quarter. 
We project that total PC
E prices, after increasing at an annual rate of 1.2 percent 
in the third quarter, will accelerate to a pace of about 2 percent in the current quarter—
about ½ percentage point hi gher than in the September Tealbook.  The larger-than-
expected upswing in crude oil prices in recent  weeks led us to revi se up our forecast for 
consumer energy price inflation in the current  quarter, which accounts for nearly all of 
the upward revision to overall PCE price inflation. 
We have received little data on labor compensation since the last projection.  
Average hourly earnings rose in line with  our expectations in September, and we 
continue to project that compensation per hour will increase at an annua l rate of 2 percent 
in the second half of the year after having declined at an annual rate of about ¾ percent in 
the first half of 2010.  
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
Although the incoming economic data were, on balance, close to our expectations 
in the September Tealbook, we have raised  our projection for th e growth in real 
economic activity over the next two years in light of the revised policy assumptions and 
the associated improvement in conditioning assumptions—in particular, lower long-term 
interest rates, a further depreci ation in the dollar, and higher equity prices.  As a result, 
we now project real GDP growth to step up to 3.6 percent in 2011 and to 4.7 percent in 
2012; at the end of 2012 we now have the level of real GDP 0.6 percent higher than in the 
September Tealbook.   
Among the changes in conditioning assump tions, the deprecia tion of the dollar 
has the largest effect on our projection for real  GDP growth.  In addition, we expect that 
higher equity prices will provide additional impetus to consumer spending, while lower 
long-term interest rates will provide so me additional support for housing demand and 
business investment.  The resulting boost to domestic production is amplified by the 
normal multiplier and accelerator effects.  
Despite the upward revisions to GDP gr owth over the medium term, the basic 
dynamics of the recovery are the same as in  previous forecasts.  Supportive financial

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookconditions, continued increases in credit availa bility, a further diminishing of the adverse 
effects of earlier declines in  wealth, and a gradual recovery  in the labor market should 
contribute to an improvement in business and household confidence and provide some 
impetus to private spending growth over the next two years.  However, several other 
factors—the waning of federal fiscal stim ulus, budgetary pressures on state and local 
governments, lingering credit constraints for some potential borrowers, and a sizable 
overhang of residential and commercial real estate—will likely weigh on economic 
growth over the projection period.  On balan ce, we see these various influences as 
consistent with a further recovery in economic  activity, but one that is more modest than 
has typically followed deep U.S. recessions. 
In the household sector, we expect that  spending will be increasingly supported 
over time by more-favorable credit conditions , improvements in the pace of job creation, 
diminishing concerns about future income prospects, and a waning of the drag from 
earlier declines in wealth.  As a result, we project real consumption spending to rise about 
3 percent in 2011, about the same pace as real income growth and consistent with little 
change in the personal saving ra te.  For 2012, our projection cal ls for real PCE growth to 
pick up to 4½ percent and for the savi ng rate to edge dow n to 5 percent. 
We expect that housing market activity will  begin to pick up early next year, as 
the boost to affordability from low mortga ge rates and low house prices, increasing 
confidence that house prices have bottomed out, and modest but steady improvements in 
income and employment lead to a gradual upturn in the demand for housing.  That said, 
at 610,000 units and 880,000 units for 2011 and 2012, respectively, our projection for 
single-family housing starts is still far below the pace we believe is consistent with the longer-run demand for housing.  This shortfall reflects, in large part, the substantial 
overhang of vacant homes and lingering impedi ments to the availability of mortgage 
credit.   
We project that business outlays for equipment and software will rise about 
10 percent in 2011 and then step up to an 11½ percent growth rate in 2012—solid, albeit 
not spectacular, gains.  E&S spending  should continue to be supported by the 
replacement of aging capital, the resumption of investment projects deferred during the 
financial crisis, and some expansion of capacity  in response to rising sales.  Nevertheless, 
with the shift in the composition of the cap ital stock toward high-tech equipment and 
software—which have short se rvice lives—the aggregate depr eciation rate has continued 
to move higher.  As a result, the level of i nvestment is not much above that required to

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookreplace the depreciating stock, leaving the grow th rate of the capital stock quite low for 
an economic recovery. 
Elevated vacancy rates and our exp ectation that lending conditions for 
commercial real estate will remain tight for qu ite some time, are also expected to weigh 
on nonresidential construction ove r the medium term.  As a result, we project that 
investment in nonresidential structures will continue to decline throughout 2011 and most 
of 2012. 
In the government sector, purchases are pr ojected to rise at a very subdued pace 
over the next few years.  For the federal gove rnment, declines in spending associated 
with overseas military operations and th e waning of stimulus-related nondefense 
expenditures are assumed to slow the rise in real expenditures to ju st 1 percent in 2011 
and ¼ percent in 2012.  In the state and local  sector, budget pressures are projected to 
ease only slowly, as the expected rise in ta x collections from the recovering economy is 
partially offset by the unwinding of the federal stimulus grants.  As a result, real spending 
in this sector is anticipated to increase onl y about ½ percent next year and 1¼ percent in 
2012.   
Finally, we project that real exports will increase at an aver age annual rate of 
almost 8½ percent during 2011 and 2012, suppor ted by declines in the dollar and 
continued foreign GDP growth.  At the same tim e, real imports are expected to rise about 
5 percent in 2011 and 7 percent in 2012, as U.S. GDP growth picks up.  Taken together, 
we expect that net exports will contribute ¼ percentage point to GDP growth in 2011; in 
2012, net exports are expected to be about  a neutral factor for GDP growth.   
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU 
We made some minor adjustments to  our assumption for the NAIRU.  In 
particular, to better account for inflation dynami cs prior to the onset of the recession, we 
now assume that the NAIRU held steady at  5 percent between 2002 and 2007, rather than 
edging down to 4¾ percent as we had assumed pr eviously.  We continue to assume that 
the NAIRU increased by 1 percentage poi nt over the course of 2008 and 2009, as the 
steep increase in permanent job loss during the recession led to greater  mismatch 
between available jobs and unemployed worker s (both in terms of skills and location).  
As a result, we now estimate that the cu rrent value of the NAIRU is 6 percent,

3 The 6 percent figure for the NAIRU does not include the effects of extended and emergency 
unemployment benefits (EEB).  EEB programs add to the unemployment rate by inducing individuals who 
would otherwise have dropped out of the labor force to report themselves as unemployed in order to receive these benefits, and by enabling jobseekers to be more de liberate in their search.  We currently estimate that 
these programs are boosting the unemployment rate by close to ¾ percentage point, which is about ¼ percentage point less than we had assumed in the September Tealbook.  Looking forward, we continue to expect that these effects will diminish throughout the forecast period as the extended UI programs are 
phased out.  Because the small revision to the EEB eff ect about offsets the revision  we made to the staff’s 
NAIRU assumption, we have not materially change d our current assessment of the “effective” NAIRU, 
which we view as the amount of unemployment not repres entative of slack in resour ce utilization.  All told, 
the “effective” NAIRU declines from ab out 6¾ percent now to around 6 percent by the end of 2012, a level 
that is about ¼ percentage point above the last Tealbook.  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
October 27, 2010
Page 25 of 104
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook¼ percentage point higher than in the last Tealbook.  We assume  that it will remain at this 
new higher level through the end of 2012.3 
Our new NAIRU assumption implies th
at the level of potential GDP at the 
business cycle peak in late 2007 was about ½ percent lower than we had previously 
estimated.  However, the revision to the NAIRU has no effect on our estimates of 
potential GDP growth  after 2007, as we only adjusted the level of the NAIRU and not its 
trajectory.  Accordingly, we now estimate that the GDP gap in the second quarter of this 
year stood about 6½ percent below potential co mpared with 7 percent in the September 
Tealbook. 
The upward revision to our projection of business investment and hence to capital 
deepening since the September Tealbook imp lies a small upward revision to potential 
output growth and structural productivity gr owth in 2012.  We now project that potential 
output will rise 2.5 percent in 2011 and 2.6 percent in 2012, and we have structural 
productivity increasing 2.0 percen t in 2011 and 2.2 percent in 2012.  
 Productivity and the Labor Market 
The dynamics of the labor market recovery are largely the same in this projection 
as in the September Tealbook.  We continue to  expect that the ga p between actual labor 
productivity and its structural level—which ope ned up last year when firms continued to 
aggressively cut staffing even as output bega n to recover—will diminish over the next 
two years.  In our view, the pressures impos ed on existing workforces from the faster 
pace of operations were unsustainable in the long run.  Indeed, part of the productivity 
gap was erased over the first half of this  year, as firms resumed hiring despite the 
moderation in the pace of output growth.  We expect this trend to continue over the forecast period, with labor productivity proj ected to rise 1½ percent next year and 
2 percent in 2012, a little below our es timate of its structural rate.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookWith the improved outlook for real activity in this projection, we have marked up 
our medium-term forecast for private employment.  We now project that private 
employment gains will average about 220,000 per month in 2011 and 300,000 per month in 2012; both figures are about 20,000 higher than in the September Tealbook.  Given 
this pace of job growth, we  expect the unemployment ra te to decline from about 
9¾ percent in the current quarter to 9 percent in the fourth quarter of ne xt year and to just 
under 8 percent by the end of 2012.  
Resource Utilization 
Because we revised up the NAIRU, the cha nge to our projection for labor market 
slack over the next two years is larger than is suggested by the small revision to the 
unemployment rate.  Even so, the amount of current and projected slack remains very 
large.  By our estimate, the unemploymen t rate in the current quarter is about 
3 percentage points above the effectiv e NAIRU, unchanged from the September 
Tealbook; in the projection, the unemployment gap declines to about 1¾ percentage 
points by the end of 2012.  This extended period of considerable labor market slack is 
likely to be associated with other features of a weak labor market, including below-trend 
labor force participation and an unusually large concentration of workers experiencing 
unemployment spells  of long duration. 
Reflecting the upward revision to our for ecast for real activity, we now estimate 
that the GDP gap narrows by 3 percentage points between the current quarter and the end 
of 2012, about ½ percentage point more than in the previous Tealbook.  We continue to 
expect that the GDP gap will narrow more slowly than the rate at which unused plant 
capacity in the industrial sector is taken up, in part because manufacturing capacity is 
projected to remain flat in 2010 and 2011 and then to expand only about 1 percent in 
2012.  Indeed, by the end of 2012, our projection  has the factory operating rate returning 
to near its long-run average.  
Compensation and Prices 
We expect that the wide margin of la bor market slack, along with low rates of 
price inflation, will continue to restrain labor costs over the forecast period.  The 
Productivity and Cost measure of compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector 
is projected to rise only about 2 percent per year in 2011 and 2012.  Similarly, we expect 
the employment cost index to rise at an annua l rate close to 2 percent over the medium 
term.  These modest increases in hourly comp ensation, in combination with the moderate

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlookrise in labor productivity in this forecast, re sult in unit labor costs that edge up over the 
medium term.   
As noted above, prices of imported core goods are expected to rise at an annual 
rate of 4½ percent in the near term, a reflection of the recent dollar depreciation and steep 
increases in nonfuel commodity prices.  Thereafter, as commodity prices edge down and the dollar depreciates at a moderate rate, we project that core import price inflation will 
settle down to an annual pace of about 1¼ percent. 
As in previous forecasts, we anticipate th at reduced labor cost pressures and low 
levels of resource utilization will exert a downward influence on core PCE inflation over 
the projection period, but that further disinf lation will be checked by ongoing stability in 
inflation expectations.  With the degree of slack in this pr ojection somewhat less than in 
the last projection and with co re import prices rising more rapidly, we now project that 
core PCE inflation will be 1.0 percent in both 2011 and 2012—about 0.1 percentage point 
higher than in the September Tealbook. With ener gy prices expected to rise a little faster 
than core prices, our projection for headline in flation is just a bit above core inflation 
over the medium term. 
T
HE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2015 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assessments of long-run supply- side conditions, fisc al policy, and other factors.  The 
contour of the long-run outlook depe nds on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long 
run, consistent with th e majority of longer-term inflation projections 
provided by FOMC participan ts at the June meeting. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities follow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B.  We assume that the projected decline in the System’s holdings beginning in 2013 will contribute about 25 basis points to the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield over the 2013–15 period.  
 Beyond 2012, the risk premiums on corporate bonds and equity decline 
gradually to normal levels, and banks ease their lending standards 
somewhat further.   
   
                                                   
4 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate (R) converges over the course of 2013 to the 
prescriptions of a Taylor-type rule of the form R = 2.5 + π - 1.1(u-u*) + 0.5( π – 2), subject to the zero 
lower bound constraint.  In this expression, π denotes the four-quarter rate of core PCE inflation, u is the 
civilian unemployment rate, and u*  is the staff estimate of the NAIRU (with an adjustment for the 
temporary effects on unemployment of the extended and emergency unemployment benefit programs).  In 
essence, this formula is just the traditional Taylor ru le, rewritten in terms of the unemployment gap, with 
the coefficient on resource utilization appropriately rescaled.  Beyond 2013, the federal funds rate equals 
the prescriptions of the rule.

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook The federal government budget deficit narrows to about 4¼ percent of 
GDP by the end of 2015.  This improvement reflects the effects of the 
economic recovery on tax receipts and transfer payments as well as further policy actions after 2012 aime d at reducing the deficit. 
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate 
1 percent per year in the 2013–15 period.  The price of WT I crude oil rises 
to around $90 per barrel by the end of 2015, consistent with futures prices.  
Under these assumptions, movements in the prices of energy and imports have only minor implications for domestic inflation in the extension.  Foreign real GDP expands, on average,  about 3¼ percent per year from 
2013 through 2015, near its trend rate. 
 Over the 2013–15 period, the NAIRU declines from 6 percent to 
5¼ percent, as the functioning of the labor market improves.  Potential 
GDP is assumed to expand 2¾ percent per year, on average, from 2013 to 
2015.  
The unem
ployment rate enters 2013 well above the assumed NAIRU, and the 
staff’s estimate of the output gap is still quite wide.  Real GDP rises at an annual rate of 
4¾ percent on average in 2013 and 2014, faster  than its potential pace, as improved 
confidence, diminished uncertainty, and s upportive financial conditions allow aggregate 
demand to catch up with aggregate supply.  Unemployment falls over this period, 
inflation moves back toward the assumed l ong-run target, and the federal funds rate 
continues to rise, reaching 3¾ percent in 2015.4  With improvements in confidence and 
financial conditions largely complete by 2015, real GDP growth moves back toward the 
growth rate of potential.  By the end of 2015, the unemploym ent rate falls to the NAIRU, 
and consumer price inflation reaches 1½ pe rcent, on its way back up to the assumed 
target of 2 percent.

Recent indicators of foreign economic activity have come in a touch softer than 
we had anticipated in September, reinforcing our judgment  that growth abroad is slowing 
appreciably in the secon d half of this year, to about 2½ percent at an annual rate.  As 
usual, there have been  some differences  across countries , with China having somewhat 
greater momentum but other key countries, such as Japan and Canada, showing some 
softness.  Nonetheless, the basic story r emains one in which the initial boost from the 
bounceback in global trade, manufacturing, and inventories has waned, while a self-sustaining pickup in private consumption and capital formation has yet to fully materialize in the advanced economies.   
Going forward, we continue to project a firming of growth abroad, to 3¼ percent 
next year and 3½ percent in 2012, as further normalization in financial conditions and 
progress in household deleveraging lead to a gradual revival in private spending that  
more tha n offsets a withdrawal of policy stimulus.   Although fiscal policy has been 
approximately neutral this year, we anticipate that  fiscal consolidation will exert a drag 
on foreign growth in 2011 and 2012.  Our  outlook for foreign activity over the next two 
years is little changed  from the September forecast , with the negative impact of the 
currency appreciation  recently experienced  in some countries approximately balanced  by 
the positive effects of moderately higher asset prices and the upward revision to U.S. demand growth.   
A reacceleration of food and energy prices helped push up foreign inflation to 
2 percent in the third quarter and to an expected 2½ percent in the current quarter.  Foreign i nflation  should average about 2¼ percent over the next two years , as continued 
resource slack, mainly in the advanced economies, keeps inflation subdued.  J apan  
remain s in deflation throughout the period.   
With inf lation prospects well contained, we expect that monetary policy abroad 
will remain generally  accommodati ve, and  we now see a somewhat easier stance in 
several countries.  The Bank of Japan undertook additional easing measures over the intermeeting period , partly in response to the appreciation of the yen , and we have pushed 
back our assumptions of central bank tightening in the United Kingdom and Canada in the face of economic headwinds in those countries and additional monetary easing in the United States.   Monetary policy in many emerging market economies (EMEs) generally

has tightened as anticipated.  Howe ver, expectations of additional asset purchases by the 
Federal Reserve, an acceleration of capital flows to the EMEs, and heightened currency 
tensions have added to the uncertainty about future monetary policy responses in both advanced and emerging  market  economies .     
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES   
We continue to forecast an anemic recovery in the advanced foreign economies 
(AFEs) , with output growth sufficient to erode resource slack only gradually  over the 
next several years.  AFE growth has slow ed from 3 ½ percent in the first half of this year 
to an estimated  2 percent in the second half.  T his step -down in growth is a bit larger than 
anticipated in September, reflecting recent weaker -than-expected indicators for 
consumption and trade in Canada and Japan.  Moreover, w e expect  AFE economic 
growth to remain at only around 2 percent through 2011, held down by increasing fiscal 
consolidation, diminishing  contributions from the inventory cycle, and continuing 
balance sheet repair.  In 2012, AFE growth picks up to 2½ percent as private spending 
strengthens and balance sheet pressures abate, but significant slack remain s in Europe 
and Japan at  the end of the period.     
Economic Activity  and Prices  
Canada.  Indicators suggest fairly tepid growth in Canada in the third quarter.  
Net
 exports appear to have subtracted  2½ percentage points from third -quarter GDP 
growth, much more than we expected  in September, while employment growth slowed in 
the third quarter and recent  retail sales were  weak .  However,  capital good s imports 
continued to boom, and investment intentions were at a 10-year high.  All told, we now 
estimate that GDP increased 1¾  percent in the third quarter, ½ percentage point lower 
than in the last Tealbook.  Going forward, w e expect the recent appreciat ion of the 
Canadian dollar to weigh on exports, but w e see relatively robust domestic demand 
pushing economic growth up to 2½ percent in the fourth quarter and in 2011 and to nearly 3  percent in 2012.  We expect Canadian  headline inflation to rise graduall y from 
1¾ percent over the past 12 months to 2¼ percent by the end of 2012 as economic slack 
diminishes .   
Japan.  
We estimate that Japanese real GDP grew 1½  percent in the third quarter.  
Although this is about the same pace as  in the previous quarter, it reflects faster growth in 
domestic spending , in line with gradually firming labor markets,  as the stronger yen has

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Page 37 of 104
contributed to some weakening of export growth .  However , government incentives for 
auto purchases partly explain t he recent strength  in private consumption, and their 
expiration should push GDP growth down temporarily  in the current quarter.  Even with 
consumption picking up going forward, we project real GDP to rise  only 1½ percent in 
2011 and 2 percent in 2012, not enough to push inflation into positive territory .  In 
October, t he Japanese government approved a ¥5.1 trillion  (1 percent of GDP ) stimulus 
plan to boost employment and help small businesses.  However, most of the funding 
appears to come from reshuffling existing budget priorities.   
Euro area.  
With financial stresses stemming from fiscal problems apparently  
remaining  contained to the peripheral economies, the euro area appears to have dodged a 
bullet.  Even so, with the support from inventory rebuilding and fiscal stimulus going 
away, we e stimate  that euro -area economic growth slow ed to about a 1¾ percent annual 
rate in the second half and  expect it to  slow still further, to 1 percent , in 2011.  Euro -area 
industrial production rose sharply in August, with  Germany continu ing to out perform, but 
purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) moved down in recent months in most countries and edged into contractionary territory in Spain and Ireland.  The recent euro appreciation is likely to be a drag on euro- area exports, and we have lowered our projection for euro-
area GDP growth ¼ percentage point in 2011.   Euro -area growth is expected to rebound 
to 2¼ percent in 2012 as the effects of the euro’s recent sharp upsurge wane and domestic 
demand accelerates.   Euro -area 12 -month headline inflation is  expected to remain around 
1½ percent over the forecast period. 
W
e continue to expect that fiscal policy will subtract about 1 percentage point 
from euro -area economic growth in each of the next two years.  France, Portugal , and 
Spain recently announced fu rther  budget cuts for 2011, and Ireland is likely to follow.  
Although, to date, peripheral euro- area countries have implemented their announced 
fiscal consolidation plans, uncertainties remain regarding their ability to reduce their fiscal deficits suffic iently to achieve long -run fiscal sustainability.  
United Kingdom.  
According to the preliminary estimate, U.K. real GDP 
expanded 3¼ percent in the third quarter, 1½ percentage points more than we had expected in September.  However, recent survey indicator s point to a marked step-down 
in economic growth in the fourth quarter.  On October 20, the government announced details o f its plan to cut nonhealth expenditures about 20 percent in real term s over the 
next f our years , which should subtract about 1¾ percentage points from output growth in

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
October 27, 2010
Page 38 of 104   
2011 and 2012.  Despite this drag, GDP growth gradually increases  to 2½ percent by the 
end of 2012, as exporters continue to benefit from a relatively weak effective exchange 
rate and as financial headwinds diminish .  U.K. 12-month inflation, currently running at 
over 3 percent, is expected to remain above the 2-percent target through the end of 2011, in part because of a further scheduled VAT increase, before moving below target in 2012. 
Monetary Policy 
In response to the yen’s appreciation and increased downside risks to economic 
activity and inflation, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) took additional steps to ease policy by  
cutting its target interest rate from 10 basis points to a range of  0 to 10 basis points.  In 
addition, it established an asset purchase program of up to ¥5 trillion ( 1 percent of GDP ) 
to buy a broad range of financial assets, including ¥3½ trillion in government debt with a residual maturity of one to two years.  W e assume that the BOJ will keep its policy rate 
near zero through the end of the forecast period and that it will increase the pace of  its 
asset purchases moderately.  
In the face of additional monetary easing in the United States and a recovery that 
is expected to remain subdued over the forecast period, we are assuming more accommodative paths for monetary policies in Canada and the United Kingdom.  With Canadian GDP growth looking softer than expected, we pushed the Bank of Canada’s 
next rate hike to the first quarter of 2012, lowering the path for the policy rate 50 basis points relative to the September Tealbook.  Similarly, we pushed back the Bank of 
England’s (BOE)  first rate hi ke to the second half of 2012.  R ecent speeches and minutes 
show the BO E’s Monetary Policy Committee to be divided on whe ther to conduct 
additional large- scale asset purchases, but we expect this issue to be resolved in the next 
few months.  Although euro- area overnight interest rates recently have risen, they remain 
below the European Central Bank’s ( ECB ) benchmark policy r ate of 1 percent, and w e 
continue to assume the ECB will not raise that rate until the second half of 2012. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
Recent indicators continue to suggest that economic activity decelerated sharply 
in the emerging market economies from a ferocious 10 percent pace in the second  quarter  
to an estimated 2 ½ percent in the third quarter .  This estimate is only a touch below our 
September projection, as upward surprises for Mexico and China were roughly offset by 
a sharper -than-expected deceleration in the rest of emerging Asia —due mostly to an

Recent Developments in Cross -Border Direct Investment  
Foreign d irect investment registered net outflows from the United States at a 
near- record rate during the first half of 2010 .  These high net outflows are largely 
the result of weak gross direct investment inflows into the United States (the 
blue line in the lower-left figure) , which eased considerably during the crisis and 
have not yet recovered.  In contrast, gross  direct investment outflows (the  red 
line), which also eased during the crisis, have returned to normal levels.  This  
recent divergen ce of  direct investment inflows and outflows seems to have been 
driven mainly by  the slower recovery of U.S. economic activity relative to foreign 
activity , rather than by a more fundamental shift in the perceived attractiveness 
of investing abroad, as discussed below.   That said, U.S. firms appear to be 
delaying the repatriation of their foreign earnings, apparently for tax -
management purposes.  
As indicated in the lower- right figure, direct investment outflows are comp osed 
of new investment plus retained earnings abroad.  New equity investment s in 
overseas operations (the purple area) have remained subdued, and the share of 
earnings reinvested a t the se affiliate s (the black line) has increased only slightly , 
suggesting that the overseas investment behavior of U.S. firms has not shifted appreciably of late.  R ather, e arnings at foreign affiliates  have increased in line 
with the recovery in economic activity abroad, and  the amount of reinvested 
earnings (the green area) has risen accordingly.  
Detailed survey data on the balance sheet positions of foreign affiliates will not be released for several years, so we do not know how firms are using their 
reinvested earnings.  However, a necdotal reports suggest that much  of the 
earnings retained  by U.S. firms abroad are being held as cash and cash 
equivalents  to avoid the U.S. tax liability incurred wh en such funds are 
repatriated.  Indeed, in recent months  several large U.S. multinational 
corporation s known to have large amounts of available cash abroad  have issued 
new debt to finance dividend  payment s and share repurchases  rather than

outsized contraction in Singapore.  The overall step -down in growth in the EMEs  is, 
importantly , a result of the maturation of the inventory cycle, but the unwinding of 
stimulus measures and continued tightening of monetary policies in many countries have 
also contributed. 
GDP g rowth in the EMEs is projected to move up to 3½ percent in the fourth 
quarter  as emerging Asia ’s economy rebounds but Latin America ’s slows, with weakness 
in the U.S. manufacturing sector continuing  to weigh on Mexican activity.  As  the United 
States and other advanced economies pick up steam, real GDP growth in the EMEs should rise to around 5 percent by mid -2012.  This projection is up slightly  from the 
previous Tealbook, with the positive effect of faster U.S. GDP growth only partly offset by the negative effect of recent EME currency appreciation.   Consumer price inflation in 
the EMEs appear s to have been about 3¼ percent in the third quarter and will likely  
remain at about that pace through the forecast period.  
With economic activity returning to normal levels and interest rates on the rise in 
many EMEs, m onetary policy has been complicated by mounting capital inflows, which 
appear to be  pushing up asset prices and intensif ying upward pressure s on EME 
currencies .  Monetary authorities in these countries have a number of options to respond 
to these circumstances , none without drawbacks, including :  
• reduc ing the pace of monetary tightening, thus risking higher inflation and 
asset bub bles;  
• continuing to tighten monetary policy while allowing their currencies to rise, 
which could depress manufacturing and exports more than they would like; and/or  
• continuing to tighten policy while seeking to hold down currency appreciation through int ervention , capital controls, or both, which may prove ineffective.  
In our baseline, we assume EME authorities will adopt combinations of all three 
strategies: tempering their monetary policy tightening somewhat, allowing some upward 
movement of their currencies, but continuing to use exchange market intervention and (sporadically) capital controls to limit the extent of currency appreciation.  In the “ Risks 
and Uncertainty” section, we describe an alternative scenario in which emerging Asian 
economies  allow a much larger appreciation of their  currencies.

China.  Chinese real GDP expanded 9¾ percent at an annual rate in the third 
qua
rter, about 2 percentage points higher than projected in the previous Tealbook.  
Domestic demand  remained strong , with real re tail sales and fixed asset investment each 
up about 20 percent from a year earlier.  Going forward, we continue to expect that 
Chinese authorities will be successful in adjusting policy to achieve GDP growth in the neighborhood of 8 to 9 percent.   
Ca
pital flows into China apparently have picked up  since late June, when 
authorities announced they would allow more flexibility in the exchange rate.  China’s foreign exchange reserves rose a record $194 billion in the third quarter, although as 
much as  half of t his may have been due to valuation adjustments  as the dollar fell against 
the euro.  Property prices, which had been flat since April, edged higher in September, and the Shanghai equity index has risen sharply since late September.  In response to 
these developments , as well as the strong third -quarter GDP growth , the People’s Bank of 
China (PBOC) raised the one-year lending and deposit rates ¼ percentage point each; this was the first interest rate adjustment since China stopped easing rates in December 20 08.  
The PBOC also temporarily raised reserve requirements for six of the largest banks by ½ percentage point, the fourth such increase this year. 
Other Emerging Asia.  
For the other emerging Asian economies, we marked down 
our estimate of growth in the th ird quarter.  This markdown mostly reflected  the 
preliminary GDP estimate  for Singapore of negative 20 percent at an annual rate, which 
followed growth of 35 percent in the first half.  The third- quarter contraction , as usual, 
was driven by the volatile bi omedical sector, although other sectors, including high- tech 
manufacturin g, have also cooled.  Overall, data in the rest of emerging Asia ha ve also 
come in somewhat weaker than had been expected; September PMIs fell in Korea, Taiwan, and India, with the ir levels in Korea and Taiwan  in the contraction range.  
Nevertheless, w e expect growth in emerging Asia excluding China to pick up to 
3½ percent in the current quarter and then to average about 4¾ percent in 2011 and 2012, 
supported by solid domestic demand and the eventual recovery in the advanced 
economies.  
A
s in China, a recent increase in capital in flows to other Asian EMEs appears to 
be put ting upward pressure on some currencies  and asset prices.  In response, Thailand 
ended its preferential tax treatmen t of foreign holders of Thai bonds, and Singapore 
widened its exchange rate band and increased the pace at which  the band crawls to allow

more rapid currency appreciation.   Taiwan increased its policy rate in late September, 
partly reflecting concerns about rising house prices. 
Latin America.  
We estimate that real GDP growth in Latin America slowed 
sharply to 3 percent in the third quarter, largely reflecting payback in Mexico from the 
outsized gain in the second quarter.  This  estimate, however,  is about 1 percentage point 
higher than in the previous Tealbook, as Mexican data have not been quite as weak as we 
had projected .  Nevertheless, we continue to expect Mexican growth to remain subpar in 
the second half of this year, weighed down by the current sluggishness in U.S. 
manufacturing production.  The outlook for U.S. manufacturing is somewhat more upbeat in 2011 and 2012, and we have revised up Mexican growth nearly ½ percentage point in those years.   This revision now puts Latin American growth over the next two years at an 
average of about 3¾ percent.  
Br
azilian data releases indicate that growth eased in the third quarter.  The central 
bank’s index of economic activity in July and August was only slightly above its second-quarter average, and employment growth  slowed.  Brazilian a uthorities have responded to 
the high volume of capital inflows by rais ing taxes on foreign portfolio investment in an 
effort to damp appreciation pressure on the real .  
Chile, with its dependence on copper 
exports, appears to be benefiting from high commodity prices and has experienced very rapid growth over the past two quarters.  Chilean authorities have raised their policy rate twice since the last Tealbook.

Financial Developments 
Financial conditions became somewhat more supportive of economic growth over 
the intermeeting period, reportedly as invest ors became increasingly confident that the 
Federal Reserve would soon undertake addi tional purchases of longer-term Treasury 
securities.  The anticipated path of the fe deral funds rate moved down, and most nominal 
Treasury yields declined on net.  Market-b ased measures of inflation compensation 
moved up on balance.  Boosted in part by fa vorable earnings news and lower interest 
rates, broad stock price indexes rose, a nd risk spreads on corporate bonds narrowed 
somewhat.  However, stock prices for banks generally underperformed the broader 
market, amid concerns about possible im proper handling of mortgage foreclosure 
documents and compliance with securitization agreements.  The exchange value of the 
dollar declined against most other currencies , largely on the heighten ed expectations for 
additional monetary policy accommodation in the United States.   
Credit conditions for businesses and households continued to be mixed.  
Borrowing by nonfinancial corporations was quite robust over the intermeeting period, 
and indicators of corporate credit quality remained solid.  While commercial mortgage 
debt is estimated to have cont racted further in the third qu arter, reflecting the sector’s 
overall distress, signs of modest improvement have continued to emerge.  For 
households, lower mortgage rates supported a re latively high level of refinancing activity, 
but many borrowers remain unable to refina nce because of negative equity and weak 
credit scores.  Consumer credit fell further in  August, while credit qua lity in this sector 
continued to improve slowly. 
 Core loans at commercial banks contracted  again in September, and available data 
for October suggest that the trend has continued.  The Oc tober Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated only a small further 
unwinding of the very tight level of banks’ lending standards and terms over the past 
three months.  M2 expanded briskly in Septembe r and October, as strong growth in liquid 
deposits and currency more than offset dec lines in small time deposits and retail money 
market mutual funds.

Financial DevelopmentsPOLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Money market futures rates and most Treasury yields fell ov er the intermeeting 
period, reportedly as investors priced in th e view that the FOMC would announce that it 
would execute additional purchases of longe r-term Treasury securities at the upcoming 
meeting.1  At the beginning of the period, the exp ected path of the federal funds rate, as 
well as 5- and 10-year nominal Treasury yiel ds, declined notably upon the release of the 
September FOMC statement, as market partic ipants interpreted the language to imply 
higher odds of additional asset purchases.  Investors took particular note of the language 
in the statement indicating th at inflation was below the levels consistent with the 
FOMC’s dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability.  In the weeks following the FOMC meeting, Federal Rese rve communications along with economic 
data releases that continued to point to a tepid outlook appeared to reinforce market 
expectations that additional monetary policy accommodation will be forthcoming in the near term.  The minutes of the September FOMC  meeting were largely viewed as in line 
with expectations and prompt ed little market reaction.   
Futures quotes, com
bined with the usual staff assumptions for term premiums, 
indicate that the expected path for the federa l funds rate first rises above the current 0 to 
¼ percent target range in th e second quarter of 2012.  The e xpected path of the federal 
funds rate now reaches only about 50 basis poi nts in the fourth quarter of 2012, nearly   
40 basis points below the level expected at th e time of the September FOMC meeting.  
Part of the decline in futures rates may reflec t a decrease in term premiums, as measures 
of near-term interest rate uncertainty moved down over the intermeeting period.  Quotes 
on interest rate caps suggest th at the modal path of the federal funds rate also fell a good 
deal over the period; th is path does not rise above the cu rrent target range until the third 
quarter of 2013. 
Results from the latest survey of primary dealers indicate that market participants 
lowered their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate, while their forecasts for 
economic growth, inflation, and unemployment were little changed through the end of 
2012.  On average, respondents reported a probab ility of nearly 90 pe rcent that the first 
tightening would occur in the fourth quarter  of 2011 or later, compared with about 70 
percent in the September survey.  In additi on, the dealers assigned a probability of about

Financial Developments95 percent to the Federal Reserve expa nding its balance sheet through additional 
securities purchases before the end of the year, compared with a bout 40 percent in the 
previous survey.  Should the FOMC announce additional Treasury purchases, the dealers 
assigned an average probability of about 90 percent to the implementation of an 
incremental purchase program over short to intermediate horizons, with the initial 
announcement estimated to be about $400 billion over a 4-month period and the total size 
of the program estimated to be a bout $1 trillion over a 12-month period. 
Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securi ties declined over much of the 
intermeeting period.  As with policy expectati ons, the declines seemed to largely reflect 
both Federal Reserve communications and economi c data releases that  continued to point 
to a tepid outlook.  In recent days, however, nominal Treasury yields retraced some of 
their initial declin es, in part as investors may have become more uncertain about the size 
and implementation of additional Treasury purchases.  On net over the period, yields at 
maturities between 2 and 10 years fell modestly; yields at the 5-year maturity declined  
15 basis points, likely reflecting market expect ations that additional Treasury purchases 
will be concentrated at intermediate matur ities, as in the first LSAP program and in 
recent operations reinvesting principal repaymen ts on securities held in the System Open 
Market Account.  Over the intermeeting peri od, the Open Market Desk at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York purchased about $3 8 billion of Treasury securities with the 
proceeds of principal repayments on the Syst em’s holdings of agency MBS and agency 
debt. 
TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next 5 years increased about 45 basis 
points during the intermeeting period, reflecting in part highe r oil prices, and inflation 
compensation 5 to 10 years ahead rose a bout 25 basis points.  Forward inflation 
compensation based on inflation swaps also  rose notably over the period.  Market 
participants largely attributed  the increase in longer-term inflation compensation to an 
upward revision in inflation expectations and also to higher inflati on risk premiums, as 
expectations of additional monetary polic y accommodation solidif ied.  Some of the 
upward revision in inflation expectations probabl y reflected investors’ sense that the risk 
of deflation had diminished.  The emphasis on the price stability mandate in recent 
FOMC communications was reportedly interpreted as suggesting that the Committee will act forcefully to counter any further disinflationary  pressures, and estimated probabilities 
of deflation from TIPS declined over the intermeeting period.  Changes in survey 
measures of inflation expectations were mixe d.  The near-term inflation forecast from the

Financial DevelopmentsThomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers rose 40 basis points 
over the intermeeting period, cons istent with the rise in in flation compensation, while the 
longer-term inflation forecast from this survey  and from the primary dealer survey both 
edged down slightly. 
ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad stock price indexes rose about 4 percent, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, reflecting increased investor confidence that further monetary policy 
accommodation will be forthcoming, as well as better-than-expected third-quarter earnings news.  Option-implied volatility on th e S&P 500 index decreased a bit further.  
The spread between the staff’s estimate of th e expected real return  on equity for S&P 500 
firms and an estimate of the real 10-year Tr easury yield—a rough m easure of the equity 
risk premium—narrowed a bit but remained at an elevated level. 
The S&P 500 bank index declined about 2½ percent over the intermeeting period, 
although bank CDS spreads edged down, on net.   Stock prices of banking firms with 
potentially larger exposures to the recent mortgage documentation problems fell more 
(see the box “Financial Conseque nces of the Mortgage Documentation Problems”).  The 
decline in stock prices for banking firms occu rred despite third-quarter earnings results 
for large bank holding companies that generally met or exceeded analysts’ expectations, with improvements in loan performance leadi ng banks to further re duce their provisions 
for loan losses.  However, several banks reported declines in total revenue, mostly 
reflecting contractions in their loan portfolios.   
Pricing and conditions in corporate debt markets generally improved over the 
intermeeting period.  Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds declined somewhat more than those on comp arable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving 
corporate bond spreads slightly lower.  Far- term forward spreads for high-yield corporate 
bonds dropped by more than the corresponding n ear-term forward spreads, suggesting an 
increase in investors’ willingne ss to take on risk in that ma rket.  Indeed, far-term forward 
spreads for high-yield bonds are at their lowest levels sin ce early 2005.  In the syndicated 
leveraged loan market, spreads have narrowe d and borrower leverage has increased in 
recent months, reportedly reflecting in part higher demand from institutional investors.  In the secondary market, loan prices have continued to move up and bid-asked spreads 
have narrowed a bit further.  Measures of liquidity in secondary markets for corporate 
bonds changed little over the period.

Financial DevelopmentsFinancial  Consequences  of the Mortgage  Documentation  Problems  
Over the intermeeting  period, market participants  became increasingly  concerned  about the 
implications  for a number  of financial institutions  of mounting  evidence  that important 
procedural  steps were mishandled  in the transferring  of title when  mortgages  were sold and 
securitized  and in the processing  of paperwork during  the foreclosure  process.  Further, investors  
became refocused  on the possibility that the quality of mortgages  placed into the pools backing 
these securities  may have been misrepresented.  Estimates  of the extent and  size of the 
exposures  for mortgage  originators,  servicers,  investors,  and trustees continue  to evolve and 
remain far from clear.1  
Several servicers
 declared  moratoriums  on foreclosure  proceedings to review their  document  
processing  and to correct  any problems  found.  In addition,  attorneys  general in all 50 states  
launched  an investigation into  bank foreclosure  procedures.   A couple of  firms subsequently  
lifted their moratoriums, but foreclosures  are still likely  to proceed  more slowly than had been 
the case previously.      
Financial insti tutions appear to be exposed  to losses  from these problems  through two main  
channels.   First, one possible source of  losses could stem from attempts  by holders of private‐
label MBS to force financial institutions  originating  mortgages  or sponsoring  MBS to buy back 
nonperforming  mortgages  that have been put into  securitized  pools by alleging that the quality 
of the mortgages  in the pools was misrepresented.2  Buybacks  would involve only nonperforming  
mortgages, and  so the financial institutions  buying them back would likely face losses in doing so.  
Servicers also  face potential  liability from allegations  that there were  material problems  in 
managing  the trusts and in executing  foreclosures  in a timely fashion.  While these issues  are not 
new, there has  been increased  momentum  by investors  to seek redress in  recent weeks.  The 
factual and legal issues  here are particularly  complex,  and exposures  of financial institutions  are 
especially  uncertain.    
Second, deficient paperwork  may make it more time consuming  and expensive  for the owners of 
mortgages  to prove  that they have the right to foreclose  on properties, and  some institutions  
may face penalties  associated  with improper  legal filings for documents  submitted  as part of the 
foreclosure process.   Mortgage  servicers  may also face lawsuits in connection  with completed  
foreclosures  that were conducted  improperly.    
Equity prices for a number  of large financial institutions,  especially  a few involved  in servicing  
mortgages  and sponsoring  private MBS, have declined  as investors  have become more 
concerned  about the potential  implications  of these exposures  for the profitability  of these firms 
(see table).   Spreads on  credit default swaps (CDS) for a few institutions  have moved up,  but CDS 
spreads for mos t institutions  are little changed,  suggesting  that investors  currently  see very

prices of major title insurers  have also fallen.  Meanwhile,  equity prices for mortgage  insurers 
have surged and their CDS spreads have narrowed,  as documentation  issues and violations  of 
contract provisions  may make it easier for these insurers  to force private MBS sponsors  to buy

Extended  foreclosure time lines will likely  reduce recoveries  from foreclosed  houses and

Financial DevelopmentsConditions in short-term funding markets were generally stable over the 
intermeeting period.  In unsecured markets, spreads on 30-day commercial paper issued 
by AA-rated financial institutions and lower-rat ed nonfinancial firms relative to rates on 
paper issued by highly rated nonf inancial firms were little changed on net.  Spreads of 
Libor over overnight index swap, or OIS, rates edged up but rema ined at levels similar to 
those observed prior to the emergence of euro-a rea concerns earlier this year.  In secured 
funding markets, repurchase agreement (repo) rates firm ed briefly around quarter-end, 
which coincided with the settlement of a large volume of newly issued Treasury 
securities, but were little changed on net, and spreads on 30-day asset-backed commercial 
paper remained low.  Haircuts and bid-asked spreads in repo transactions declined for a 
number of collateral types,  although haircuts on private- label residential mortgage-
backed securities moved up a bit late in  the intermeeting period, perhaps reflecting 
increased uncertainty stemming from the recent mortgage documentation problems. 
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Net debt financing of nonfinancial cor porations was extraordinarily strong in 
September, supported by hefty corporate bond issuance across the credit spectrum and a 
substantial increase in commercial paper outst anding.  Data for the first three weeks of 
October point to a moderation in bond and commercial paper financing from their 
elevated September pace.  Gross issuance of  syndicated leveraged loans in the third 
quarter remained near the average pace reco rded over the first half of the year.  
Meanwhile, commercial and industrial (C&I) loan s contracted slightly in September and 
did so again in the first two weeks of Oct ober, even though a mode rate net fraction of 
respondents to the October SLOOS reported having increased originations of C&I loans to large borrowers over the past three months.  
The pace of gross public equity issu ance from seasoned and initial public 
offerings by nonfinancial firms remained moderate in September, and early indications suggest that issuance has slowed in October.   Equity retirements in the second quarter 
were about unchanged from the first-quart er rate, as cash-financed mergers and 
acquisitions decreased a bit, while share re purchases are estimated to have picked up 
further.  As a result, net equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations is projected to have 
remained negative in the second quarter.  The recent level of net equity retirements does 
not approach the pace seen before the financ ial crisis, but announcem ents of mergers and

Financial Developmentsnew share repurchase programs during the thir d quarter and early Oc tober suggest that 
the pace of equity retirement s is continuing to ramp up. 
To date, roughly 200 firms in the S&P 500 index have report ed third-quarter 
earnings, and thus far most reports have come in well above analysts’ forecasts.  On the 
basis of the reports in hand and analysts’ current estimates for firms yet to report, 
earnings per share for S&P 500 firms in the thir d quarter are estimated to have increased 
2 to 4 percent from the prior quarter (not at  an annual rate).  Re visions to analysts’ 
expectations of year-ahead earnings for nonfinancial S&P 500 firms through mid-October 
were muted; however, these data largely pr edate the favorable ear nings-reporting season, 
and at this point we expect next month’s observation to land in positive territory. 
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporat ions appears to have remained solid.  
The aggregate ratio of debt to assets for nonfin ancial corporations declined a bit further in 
the second quarter, and the aggregate liquid asse t ratio remained near its highest level in 
over 20 years.  Upgrades of nonfinancial corporate bonds by Moody’ s Investors Service 
were moderate but nonetheless outpaced downgrad es in the third quarter.  The six-month 
trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial fi rms remained near historical lows in 
September, and the KMV expected year-ah ead default rate for nonfinancial firms 
decreased a bit in October, alt hough it remained somewhat elevated. 
Commercial real estate markets remained strained.  Commercial mortgage debt is 
estimated to have declined at an annual rate  of about 6½ percent in  the third quarter of 
2010, similar to the drop in the second quarter, and the delinquency rate for securitized commercial mortgages climbed to nearly 10 percent in September.  However, some 
signals appear to offer a bit of encouragement.  Vacancy rates for commercial buildings 
have stabilized in the third quarter.  In  addition, reflecting in creased interest in 
commercial real estate investments, the pipe line of new CMBS deals has picked up a bit 
from very low levels, and CDS index prices  for highly rated tran ches of commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have increased, on net, over the period.  Also of note, a number of large commercial banks repor ted in the latest SLOOS that demand for 
commercial real estate loans incr eased over the past three months.

Financial Developmentsabout its lowest level in the 39-year history of this series .  MBS yields posted similar 
declines.  The volume of mortgage refinanc ing activity moved up in late September and 
early October and remains at a relatively high level, while application volume for 
mortgages to purchase homes continued to be  anemic.  According to the repeat-sales 
index from CoreLogic, house pr ices declined for the third consecutive month in August; 
these declines have more than reversed the ga ins recorded last spring and returned prices 
to their average level during 2009.  The 20-city S&P/Case-Sh iller house price index also 
declined in August.  The delinquency rate on prime mortgages cont inued to move down 
in September, reflecting in part the reclassi fication of delinquent mo rtgages entering loan 
modification programs as “current.”  In addi tion, the share of mortgages becoming newly 
delinquent—that is, transitioning from curre nt to delinquent—edged down further in 
August. 
Consumer credit contracted at an annu al rate of about 1¾ percent in August, 
roughly in line with the pace of decline posted earlier in the year, as another sharp 
contraction in revolving credit more than offset a small rise in nonrevolving credit.  
Consumer ABS issuance was solid in Septembe r, and consumer credit quality continued 
to improve, though delinquency rate s generally remain elevated. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Driven largely by the anticipation of fu rther asset purchases by the Federal 
Reserve, the dollar declined against most other currencies (see the box “The Effects of Large-Scale Asset Purchase Announcements by the Federal Reserve on Exchange 
Rates”).  The Bank of Japan expanded its asset purchase program and reduced slightly further its policy target rate, while some ot her central banks in the advanced foreign 
economies appeared likely to pursue a more acco mmodative path of monetary policy.  In 
some emerging market economies, authoritie s continued to interv ene, perhaps more 
intensively, in foreign exchange markets to limit appreciation of their currencies and took 
policy actions to curb capital inflows.  
The exchange value of the dollar fell 2½ percent during the pe riod against a broad 
array of foreign currencies, as the dollar declined 3½ per cent against advanced-economy 
currencies and 1¾ percent against emerging ma rket currencies.  Chinese authorities 
allowed the renminbi to appreciate ¾ percen t against the dollar over this period, while the 
dollar depreciated about 5 percent against the euro and the yen.  Of note, the yen 
appreciated versus the dollar beyond the level that triggere d a Japanese intervention in

1 The LSAP announcement  days we consider  are as follows:  November  25, 2008; 
December  1, 2008; December  16, 2008; January 28, 2009;  March 18, 2009;  and September  
21, 2010. 
2 This effect  is somewhat  smaller  than the response  in FRB/US simulations,  which 
deliver a total depreciation  of 2 to 3 percent  in response  to a 25 basis point decline in the 
term premium  on the 10‐year Treasury.  
3 Alternatively,  assuming  the surprise component  of the LSAP  announcement  was 
equal across all announcement  dates, we find that on average the dollar  declined 
1¾ percent  against these currencies  on those days, a statistically  significant  move.  We 
also find that a 25 basis point decline in the 10‐year rate is associated  with  about 1 percen t 
depreciation  in the major currencie s in
dex and 1½ percent  depreciation  in the broad 
currencies  index, statistically  significant  moves. 
4 We examine exchange  rate movements  one week  after  the LSAP  announcement  
and find that movements  after  the announcement  show no statistically  significant  trend 
in either direction,  suggesting  that the effect  LSAPs  had on exchange  rates is persistent.  The Effects  of Large‐Scale  Asset Purchase  Announcements  by 
the Federal Reserve on Exchange  Rates 
A potentially  important  channel by which large‐scale asset purchases  (LSAPs) can 
influence  economic  activity is through their effects on exchange  rates.  LSAPs 
might have  such effects  if the purchases  are interpreted  as signaling  a future 
easing of monetary  policy—for  example,  by extending  the period over which  
short‐term  interest rates are expected  to be kept low.  In addition,  LSAPs might 
influence  exchange  rates through portfolio rebalancing  effects:  The reduced 
supply of longer‐term domestic assets  might induce investors  to attempt  to 
substitute  into other securities,  including  foreign securities,  decreasing  the 
exchange  value of the dollar. 
To estimate the  effects that LSAPs conducted  by the Federal Reserve  have had 
on U.S. dollar exchange  rates, we examine the  behavior  of the dollar around the 
time of six LSAP‐related  announcements  that have occurred  since November 
2008.1  These announcements  were chosen because they  appear to have 
conveyed  unexpected  information  about prospective  asset purchases  to the 
market.  We consider  four exchange  rates—the  U.S. dollar in terms of  the yen, 
pound sterling, euro, and Canadian  dollar—for a total  of 24 observations  (six 
events times four exchange  rates).  Figure 1 compares  changes in these exchange  
rates to the changes in  the 10‐year U.S.  Treasury  rate, which we interpret  as a 
measure of the amount of new LSAP information  contained  in each release.  An  
LSAP announcement  that caused a 25 basis  point decline in the 10‐year Treasury  
rate appears  to have been associated  with a depreciation of  the dollar ranging 
from 1 to 2 percent,  with a  sample average decline of about 1¼ percent,  a 
statistically  significant move.2,3  Of course,  with relatively  few events,  there is 
considerable uncertainty  around the strength  of this relationship.   Nonetheless, 
we do find that the effect LSAPs had on exchange  rates is persistent.4 
For comparison,  we show in figure 2 the relationship  between changes  in the  
10‐year Treasury  rate and exchange rate  movements  around recent FOMC 
announcement  dates prior to the  inception  of the LSAP programs.   On these 
days, we observe that a 25 basis point decline in  the 10‐year rate  is associated  
with a statistically  significant  depreciation  in the dollar of only about ½ percent.   
Notably, the  magnitude of  the dollar depreciation  seen in response  to 
intermeeting  policy announcements,  shown in  figure 3, is similar to  the 
magnitude shown for LSAP  announcements  since 1994—a  25 basis point decline 
in the 10‐year  Treasury rate is associated  with a statistically  significant  
depreciation  of the dollar  of about 1¼ percent.5

Financial Developmentsmid-September.  Although Japanese authorities have not intervened further, the Bank of 
Japan announced on October 5 that it would cut its policy target rate from 10 basis points 
to a range of 0 to 10 basis points and hold ra tes there until a return of inflation to the 
desired range between 0 and 2 percent is “in sight.” In addition, the Bank of Japan 
announced that it would establish an asse t purchase program of up to ¥5 trillion 
(equivalent to about $60 billi on, or 1 percent of GDP) to buy a broad range of financial 
assets.  These actions were seen as relatively  modest and seemed to do little to slow the 
appreciation of the yen.  The overnight intere st rate remained just below 10 basis points, 
although longer-term interest rates did decline in subsequent days.  
Benchmark 10-year sovereign yields decl ined about 10 to 20 basis points in 
Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada, while German and French yields were little 
changed over the period.  Alt hough the Bank of England voted to keep bond purchases 
and its key policy rate unchanged, minutes from recent policy meetings and other 
policymaker statements indicated that furthe r asset purchases are be ing actively debated.  
Market participants have pushed back the date  that the Bank of England is expected to 
raise its policy rate to late 2012.  The deta ils of government spending cuts, outlined by 
U.K. finance minister George Osborne on Oc tober 20, did not elicit significant price 
reaction, as the cuts were gene rally in line with ex pectations.  Markets have also revised 
down the expected pace of tightening by the Bank of Canada, which lowered its growth and inflation outlooks.  In contrast, market-bas ed expectations of future short-term rates 
in the euro area increased slightly, and the eu ro overnight index aver age, or eonia, rate 
increased to about 85 basis points, as the ECB continued to a llow the amount of liquidity 
provided to the banking system to decline with the maturation of  several long-term 
operations.  Credit institutions in Spain, It aly, and Portugal lessened their reliance on 
ECB financing in September, and spreads relative to German bunds on the 10-year 
sovereign bonds of Greece and Portugal decreased  considerably.  In contrast, Irish banks 
increased their dependence on ECB financing, and Irish sovereign spreads were about 
unchanged.  
Major headline equity indexes in th e euro area and in the United Kingdom 
increased about 2½ percent, whereas the Nikkei index declined 2½ percent.  Early in the 
intermeeting period, euro-are a bank stock prices fell on continued concerns about 
banking sector soundness, particularly in the peripheral European c ountries.  The decline 
was reversed later in the period, in part afte r the Irish government fleshed out its plans to

economies rose, increasing 6¾ percent on average. 
As interest rates declined in the adva nced foreign economies, capital flows to 
emerging market funds increased over the past few weeks, putting upward pressure on 
emerging market currencies and reportedly triggering further intervention in foreign 
exchange markets.  Both Brazil and Tha iland announced new measures to discourage 
portfolio capital inflows in an attempt to ea se pressures on their currencies, and Korean 
officials discussed the possibility of taki ng similar steps.  Several emerging market 
central banks tightened mone tary policy:  The People’s Bank of China unexpectedly 
raised its lending and deposit rates for the firs t time in three years; the central banks of 
Chile, Singapore, and Taiw an also tightened.   
Both official and private foreign inve stors made sizable purchases of U.S. 
Treasury securities in August, while thei r purchases of corpor ate securities eased 
somewhat.  Partial and confidential data on custody accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York show heavy selling of U.S. agency MBS securities by foreign official 
accounts in September and further moderate selling in October, but these sales were 
offset by purchases of U.S. Treasury securiti es.  In addition, count ries intervening in 
foreign exchange markets to limit appreciation of their currencies invested much of the 
proceeds of these operations in U.S. Treasury securities. 
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury issued about $200 billion of nominal 
coupon securities across the maturity spectrum and $10 billion of 5-year TIPS.  The auctions were generally well received, alt hough demand at the 3-year Treasury note and 
the 30-year Treasury bond reopening auctio ns was lackluster.  The 5-year TIPS 
reopening auction conducted on October 25 stoppe d out at about negative ½ percent, the 
first negative rate ever for a Treasury auction.   
Gross issuance of long-term  municipal bonds remained robust in September and 
appears to have increased further in October, mostly driven by continued strength in new 
capital issuance.  Short-term issuance mode rated in September, but early indications 
suggest that it has picked up a bit in October.  The number of municipal bonds 
downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service in th e third quarter continued to outpace the 
number of upgrades.  Yields on municipal bonds declined a bit over the intermeeting

maturity Treasury securities edged down, on ne t, but remained at a relatively high level. 
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit edged up 1 percent at an annua l rate in September, about on par with 
the August increase, as brisk growth in banks’ holdings of securities more than offset a 
further decline in total loans.  Core loans— the sum of C&I, real estate, and consumer 
loans—dropped at a 7 percent pace, the weakes t monthly reading in this category since 
March.  C&I loans turned down in Septembe r after having increased  slightly for two 
consecutive months.  Commercial real estate  (CRE) loans and home equity loans both 
contracted further.  However, closed-end residential loans increased modestly for the 
second month in a row amid reports of robust or igination activity at several large banks.  
Consumer loans shrank at a substantially faster  pace than in recent months; about half of 
the drop was attributed to sales of student loans to the Departme nt of Education, but 
credit card loans also fell steeply, reportedly reflecting further paydowns and charge-offs.  
By contrast, banks continued to add signifi cantly to their holdings of securities in 
September, making substantial purchases in  every major category except private-label 
MBS, which ran off. 
The October SLOOS indicated that, over th e past three months, banks generally 
continued to gradually unwind the very tight standards and terms put in place over the 
past few years.  A good deal of the repor ted easing was again concentrated in C&I 
loans—a moderate net fraction of banks re ported having eased st andards on C&I loans 
and narrowed the spreads of C&I loan rate s over their cost of  funds.  Among the 
respondents that reported having eased standards or terms on such loans, most cited a 
“more favorable or less uncertain economic outlook” as well as increased competition 
from other banks and nonbank lenders as reasons for having done so.  Small net fractions 
of banks reported having tightened standard s for approving commercial real estate and 
residential mortgage loans, while changes in standards and terms for consumer loans 
were mixed but modest.  Demand for C&I lo ans reportedly declined, on net, over the 
preceding three months after having been unchanged in the three prior months.  Demand for residential mortgages and consumer loans wa s also said to be w eaker on balance.  Of 
note, larger banks reported stronger demand, on net, while smaller banks reported weaker 
demand.  In response to a set of special que stions about long-term lending standards, 
between 25 and 35 percent of banks indicated that standards on C&I loans to borrowers

2012 or would not return to them for the fore seeable future; between 40 and 75 percent of 
respondents gave the same answers for commercial and residential re al estate loans and 
other consumer loans. 
Over September and October, M2 expa nded at an average annual rate of 
8¼ percent, noticeably above its  pace earlier in the year.  Growth in liquid deposits, the 
largest com
ponent of M2, moved up to an av erage annual rate of 17¼ percent over the 
same two-month period, while small time deposit s and retail money market mutual funds 
continued to contract substantially.  The co mpositional shift toward liquid deposits likely 
reflected the relatively attractive yields on liquid deposits compared  with those on other 
M2 assets, although all rates continued to be extremely low.  Over the past two months, 
currency growth averaged 9½ percent, with  indicators suggesting strong demand from 
abroad.  The monetary base decreased at an average annual rate of 7¼ percent in 
September and October, as reserve balances d eclined on net, which more than offset the 
increase in currency (see the box “Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting

Total assets of the Federal  Reserve were marginally  changed  over the  
intermeeting  period at $2.3 trillion (see table).   Holdings  of Treasury  securities  
rose while those of other securities  fell, as principal  payments  on agency 
mortgage ‐backed securities  (MBS) and agency debt were reinvested  in longer‐
term Treasury  securities.   The Trading  Desk at the Fe deral Reserve Bank of New 
York (FRBNY)  conducted  10 operations  to reinvest repayments  of principal  on 
agency MBS and agency debt over the  intermeeting  period.  The operations,  
which included  a range of  maturities  for nominal  securities, as  well as two 
operations  in TIPS, totaled about $30 billion. 
Lending through liquidity  facilities remained  at a negli gible level, and  lending 
through other credit facilities stepped down some over the  intermeeting  period.  
In particular,  total loans outstanding  under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities  
Loan Facility  (TALF) dropped about  $4 billion, reflecting  prepayments  of 
outstanding  TALF loans.  Support for specific  institutions  also decreased  a bit 
over the period, driven  by a partial repayment by American Intern ational Group, 
Inc., or AIG, on its revolving  credit facility with the FRBNY and a modest  decline in 
the net portfolio  holdings  for each of  the Maiden  Lane LLCs. 
To prepare for the potential  need to use draining tools to manage  the aggregate 
supply of reserves, the FRBNY  initiated over the intermeeting  period a series of 
small‐ scale, real‐value reverse  repurchase transactions  with an expanded  set of 
counterparties, including  an approved  group of money market mutual funds.  As  
a result, reverse  repurchase agreements  with these counterparties,  included  in 
the “Others”  category  in the table, turned positive.1  Similarly, the Federal 
Reserve conducted  an additional  small‐ scale operation under the  Term Deposit 
Facility; as a result, term  deposits  outstanding  increased  $3 billion.  In terms of  
the Federal Reserve’s  other liabilities,  Federal Reserve  notes in circulation  
climbed $10 billion, and reserve balances  of depository  institutions  stepped up 
$16 billion.  The Treasury’s general  account decreased  $34 billion, on net, over th e

1 The October 2010 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses 
and households over the past three m onths.  The survey also included sets  of special questions on factors 
affecting recent business loan growth  and on long-term changes in lend ing standards.  This appendix is 
based on responses from 56 domestic banks and 22 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  
Respondent banks received the survey on or after October 5, 2010, and responses were due by October 19, 
2010. 
2 Large banks are defined as banks with assets greater  than or equal to $20 billion as of June 30, 2010, 
and other banks as those with assets of less than $20 billion. 
3 For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction of 
banks that reported having tightened standards minus the fraction of banks that reported having eased standards.  For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fraction of banks that 
reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand.

Financial DevelopmentsAppendix 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surve y on Bank Lending Practices  
The October 2010 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
indicated that, on net, banks eased standards and terms over the previous three months on some 
categories of loans to households and businesses.1  Both large and othe r domestic banks reported 
having eased some standards and terms; large ba nks were primarily responsible for the easing 
reported in July.2  However, lending standards appear to remain tight for many households and 
firms, and substantial fractions of banks reported in response to a set of special questions that 
standards for many categories of loans would not  return to their longer-run averages for the 
foreseeable future.  Moreover, econometric analys is shows that the amount of easing reported in 
the October survey is less than would have been expected given a number of bank-specific factors 
and the evolution of several key macroeconom ic variables over the survey period.   
Domestic survey respondents reported easing standards and most terms on commercial 
and industrial (C&I) loans to firms of all sizes, a result consistent with  continued and gradual 
unwinding of the widespread tightening that o ccurred over the past few years.  Banks mainly 
pointed to a more favorable or less uncertain economic outlook and increased competition from 
other banks or nonbank lenders as reasons for easing,  which were also the top two reasons cited 
in the April and July surveys.  Of the few banks that reported having tightened standards or terms, 
a majority reported, among other reasons, increased  concerns about the effects of legislative 
changes, supervisory actions, or changes in acc ounting standards (a new reason added to this 
survey) as being responsible for the tightening. 
Changes in standards and terms on loans to households were somewhat more mixed.  
Banks again reported an increased willingness to make consumer installment loans, and a small net fraction of respondents reported easing standa rds for approving credit card applications.  
However, small net fractions of banks reported having tightened terms and reduced the size of credit lines on existing credit card accounts.

Financial Developmentslargest respondents—also reported having tight ened standards on prim e and on nontraditional 
mortgage loans as well as standards for approving home equity lines of credit (HELOCs).   
Demand declined, on 
net, for C&I loans, par ticularly for small firms; demand for C&I 
loans had been unchanged in the July survey.4  Large banks reported increased demand for 
commercial real estate (CRE) loans, but demand weak ened at other banks.  In addition, small net 
fractions of banks reported decreased demand for a ll types of residential mortgages and consumer 
loans, though the weakness was primarily at smaller banks.  Nonetheless, weighting by the 
volume of each loan type held by each respondent , demand reportedly edged up, on net, over the 
previous three months, the first net increase since 2005.   
 LENDING TO BUSINESSES  
Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending 
The October survey showed that a modest net fraction of domestic respondents had eased 
standards on C&I loans to large and middle-market firms and to small firms over the previous 
three months—the fourth and second consecutive surveys, respectively, showing such an easing.  
Only two domestic banks repor ted having tightened standards on C&I loans.  Standards at 
branches and agencies of foreign banks had been eased slightly on net. 
For the second consecutive survey, banks re ported having eased terms on C&I loans, 
with moderate net fractions of domestic banks reporting that they had reduced spreads of loan 
rates over their bank’s cost of funds and had redu ced the costs of credit lines.  Small to moderate 
net fractions of large domestic banks and of foreign institutions  eased each of the seven survey 
loan terms for firms of all sizes.  Other domestic banks reported a net easing of the spread of loan 
rates over their own cost of funds and of the costs of credit lines, but small net fractions of those banks reported having increased collateralization requirements and tightened loan covenants.  
Domestic banks again reported little change in th e size of existing credit lines for commercial and 
industrial firms and business credit card accounts. 
Most of the respondents that eased standards or terms on C&I loans cited a more 
favorable or less uncertain economic outlook and increased competition from other banks and 
nonbank lenders as important reasons for doing so.  Of the relatively small number of banks that tightened standards or terms, most cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, a 
reduced tolerance for risk, industry-specific problem s, or increased concerns about the effects of 
legislative changes, supervisory actions, or ch anges in accounting standards.  Some cited a 
deterioration in their current or expected capital position as an important reason. 
A modest net fraction of domestic banks reported weaker demand for C&I loans from 
large and middle-market firms over the previous three months, while a somewhat larger net fraction reported weaker demand from small firms.  In the July survey, demand had been about

Financial Developmentsunchanged.  The majority of banks reporting weaker demand cited reduced financing needs by 
their customers for inventories and for accounts receivable, reduced investment in plant and equipment, and increases in internally generated funds as reasons for the decrease in demand.  
However, the number of inquiries regarding new or increased lines of credit continued to rise.  A 
moderate net fraction of foreign institutions reported st ronger demand for C&I loans. 
Special Questions on Factors Af fecting Recent C&I Loan Growth 
A set of special questions asked respondents  about factors affecting recent C&I loan 
growth.  According to the Federa l Reserve’s weekly statistical release H.8, “Assets and Liabilities 
of Commercial Banks in the United States,” C&I loans fell significantly less rapidly in the third 
quarter of 2010 than they had in the first two qua rters of the year, and large domestic banks were 
principally responsible for this moderation in the runoff of C&I loans.  On the whole, the survey 
answers help explain this recent pattern.  First, a moderate net fraction of respondents indicated that originations of new syndicated or club loans (large loans originated by a group of relationship lenders) have picked up somewhat over the past three months, activity that is 
concentrated at larger banks.  Second, a some what smaller net fraction reported increased new 
originations of other loans to large and middle- market firms, with much of the increase accounted 
for by large banks.  Other factors that were repor ted to have contributed to the reduction in the 
runoff of C&I loans included decreases in charge -offs and a modest net increase in maturing term 
loans that were rolled over or extended rather than paid off.   
In contrast, a small net fraction of banks repor ted that loans to small firms had decreased 
over the past three months.  Drawdowns on existing credit lines also reportedly had fallen.  That decline was somewhat more pronounced among foreign respondents, which tend to hold a 
disproportionate amount of revolving facilities in syndicated loan deals from lower-credit-quality 
borrowers.   Despite bond spreads that are near the bottom of their pre-crisis range, and robust net 
issuance of bonds in the third quarter, on net survey respondents indicated that early paydowns of 
C&I loans were basically unchanged over the past three months.   
Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending 
In the October survey, most respondents reported no change in their bank’s standards for 
approving CRE loans.  As in the previous survey , a small net percentage of banks reported that 
they had tightened standards; two large banks reported having eased standards for CRE loans, 
while four other banks reported having tighten ed them.  Similarly, on net, domestic banks 
reported little change in demand for CRE loans, but the banks reporting stronger demand were 
among the larger respondents in the sample, while  those reporting weaker demand tended to be 
smaller.  A modest net fraction of foreign institutions also reported stronger demand for CRE 
loans. The increase in demand seen at large banks an d foreign institutions is  consistent with the 
increase in commercial real estate sales, particularly  in larger cities, seen in recent months.

Financial DevelopmentsLENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS  
Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending 
On net, a small fraction of domestic banks reported having tightened standards on both 
prime and nontraditional mortgage loans, marking a reversal from the slight net easing reported in 
the July survey for prime loans.   The tightening of standards on prime mortgage loans was largely 
accounted for by smaller banks; large banks, on net, left standards about unchanged.  Both large 
and other banks reported a net tightening of st andards on nontraditional mortgage loans.  
Continuing a pattern seen since the start of the fina ncial crisis, fewer than half of the respondents 
reported having made such loans.  Modest net fractions of banks reported weakening demand for 
both prime and nontraditional mortgage loans to purchase homes. 
A modest net fraction of banks reported that standards for approving HELOCs had 
tightened over the past three months.  As with pr ime residential mortgage loans, that tightening in 
standards was largely accounted for by smaller ba nks.  A small net fraction of respondents also 
reported having reduced the size of HELOCs for ex isting customers.  On net, banks reported a 
slight weakening in demand for HELOCs. 
Questions on Consumer Lending 
 The net fraction of respondents reporting an increased willingness to make consumer 
installment loans ticked down to about 20 percent in the October survey.  Standards for approving 
applications for consumer loans other than credit card loans were little changed, while terms on 
such loans were either unchanged or eased slightly. 
 A moderate net fraction of banks reported having eased credit standards for approving 
applications for credit cards from individuals or households, with large banks accounting for all 
of the easing.  However, small net fractions of ba nks reported having tightened spreads of interest 
rates on credit cards over their cost of funds and reduced the size of credit lines on existing credit 
card accounts. 
 A small net fraction of banks reported a weak ening in demand for consumer loans of all 
types.  A modest net percentage of large ba nks reported an increase in demand for the third 
consecutive quarter, but a larger net percentage of other banks reported a decrease in such 
demand. 
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON LONG-TERM CHANGES IN STANDARDS  
 Another special question asked banks whether their current level of lending standards 
remained tighter than the average level over the p ast decade and, if so, when they expected that 
standards would return to their long-run nor ms, assuming that economic activity progressed 
according to consensus forecasts.  Substantial fr actions of respondents for all categories thought 
that their bank’s lending standards would return to their long-run norms after 2012 or would remain tighter than longer-run average levels for the foreseeable future:  between 25 and

5 More than three-fourths of the 20 banks that repo rted their lending standards were currently at their 
longer-run norms for C&I loans had reported tightening standards four or fewer times since January 2007, 
but only a few had reported easing standards in 2010.  Four of the banks that reported their lending standards were currently at their longer-run norms had reported tightening standards seven or more times 
since January 2007.  Most of these banks had eased standards four or more times between 2003 and 2006, 
suggesting that their tightenings during the crisis were  in part reversing easings during the prior period.

consumer loans.  In addition, nearly half of the respondents thought that standards on C&I loans 
would return to their longer-run norms by the end of 2012, and about 40 percent of respondents thought that the same would be true for residential mortgages and credit card loans to prime household borrowers.  Somewhat surprisingly, mode rate fractions of respondents indicated that 
their bank’s current level of lending standards was not tighter than its average level over the past 
decade.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY  
We continue to see the risks around our projection for economic activity as 
elevated relative to the average experience of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by 
the Committee).  The depth and duration of the recession were historically large  and the 
downturn was initiated  by a severe financial crisis.  These factors compound the 
difficulty of identifying the role s of supply and demand in generating the contraction, and 
hence the difficulty of gaugi ng the strength of the recovery .  In addition, considerable 
uncertainty attends an y assessment of the effect s of nontraditional policy actions by the 
Committee.   As discussed elsewhere in the Tealbook, a new risk to the outlook has 
emerged recently  from pr oblems with mortgage documentation.  Although our current 
judgment—as reflected in the baseline—is that these problems are most likely to have limited economic effects , we place some odds on an outcome in which these 
developments become a significant drag on the housing market, credit availability, and  
the broader economy.  Events in this area are unfolding rapidly, and we will be analyzing 
the potential range of outcomes more fully in coming weeks.  All told,  we continue to 
judge the risks to our projection of real activity as skewed to the downside. 
We also continue to see the risks around our inflation projection as elevated 
relative to the experience of the past 20 years.  The underlying pace of inflation has 
moved down to a very low level.  The shocks generating the pronounced contraction in 
labor and product markets were exceptionally large and unusual in character .  The federal 
funds rate is effectively at the zero lower bound, and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet 
has expanded dramatically .  Future prospects for the dollar and hence import prices 
remain  uncertain.  Finally, fiscal policy is judged by many observers to be on an 
unsustainable path.  Weighing these risks to both the upside and downside, we continue to see the risks around our inflation projection as roughly balanced. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS   
To illustrate some of the se risks, we consider a number of alternatives to the 
baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first scenario, we consider the possibility that the economy is on track for a stronger recovery than in the baseline.  
The second scenario considers the contrasting risk of an even more sluggish recovery in

aggregate demand  than we are projecting.  The third scenario considers another possible 
source of greater w eakness in the real economy:  less -favorable supply-side conditions 
that imply lower permanent income.  We then turn to opposing risks to the inflation 
outlook—that we will experience the more -pronounced disinflation predicted by some of 
the staff’s reduced- form models  or, alternatively , that rising commodity prices presage an 
increase in inflation .  The final two scenario s consider risk s to our exchange rate 
assumptions.    
In the alternative  scenarios, monetary policy responds to movements in real 
activit y and inflation as prescribed by a simple policy rule for the federal funds rate , 
while  nontraditional policy is assumed to follow the baseline path.  We generate the first 
five scenarios using the FRB/US model and the policy rule detailed earlier.1  The last two 
scenario s are generated using the multicountry SIGMA model, which uses a somewhat 
different policy rule for the federal funds rate that employs an alternative concept of resource utilization.

Stronger Recovery   
T
he baseline projection shows the recovery picking up speed gradually in coming 
quarters, as the restraint from unusual caution and still- restrictive credit availability  
slowly abates.  But  the factors weighing on the economy may  unwind more rapidly than 
we have assumed.   This scenario examin es a sharper  snap back in outlays on consumer 
durable goods, housing, and in business capital, reflecting a mutually reinforcing 
dynamic of improved optimism, higher spending, greater hiring, and increasing credit 
availability .  The stronger  activity in tur n buoys financial markets  and pushes equity 
prices 14 percent above baseline by the end of next year; financial conditions improve further into 2012.  This  virtuous circle causes real GDP to expand 5 ½ percent  on average 
in 2011 and 2012, bringing the unemp loyment rate down to 7 percent by late  2012.  With 
less slack, inflation is higher; however, the upward pressure is partially checked by more capital deepening and thus larger productivity gains and lower unit labor costs.  Under 
these conditions, the federal funds rate begins to rise at the end of 2011 and remains 
above baseline thereafter.

Weaker Recovery  
The recent data suggest that the recovery remains lackluster, likely reflecting  
ongoing financial headwinds and lingering uncertainty that have undermined consumer 
and business confidence.  I n current circumstances, aggregate demand may also be less 
sensitive to low interest rates than we have assumed.  In this scenario, the modest expected improvements in confidence, credit conditions, and the labor market  underlying 
our baseline projection are delayed  even further , and interest- sensitive sectors are slow to 
recover .  Accordingly, households deleverage more aggressively , pushing the saving rate 
to 7½ percent by the end of 2012, and  firms are more reluctan t to boost capital spending.  
In addition, the sluggish pace of recovery leads to a reassessment of the outlook for earnings and the riskiness of equity holdings, causing share prices to fall about 7 percent relative to baseline by late next year.  In this environment, real GDP grows only 2 percent 
next year .  In turn, labor market conditions stagnate, and the unemployment rate remains  
near 9½ percent until mid -2012.  Inflation falls in response to more- persistent slack and 
remains below baseline through 2015.  Under these conditions, liftoff of the federal funds rate from its effective lower bound is delayed until 2014.   
Lower Potential 
The pace of the recovery could also remain disappointing if we have 
overestimated the economy’s productive potential.  Indeed, some outside forecasters have 
noticeably lower estimates of potential output, and thus less slack.  If supply- side 
conditions turn out to be less favorable than we have assumed, the outlook for long-run 
levels of real household income and corporate e arnings will be more downbeat.  In this 
scenario, we assume that the output gap is currently only half as large as the baseline 
estimate of 6¾ percent,  reflecting both a permanently higher NAIRU and a lower level of 
structural productivity.  The lower long-run levels of household income and corporate 
earnings implied by this assumption, and their effects on consumption and investment, cause real GDP to expand 1  percentage point less per year, on average, than in the 
baseline through 2015; the unemployment r ate also declines more slowly.  In addition, 
inflation picks up sooner, with c ore PCE prices rising about ½ percentage point faster  
than in the baseline from 2011 through 2015, r eflecting both the direct effects of lower 
productivity on firms’ costs and a smaller margin of slack.  Over time,  policymakers take 
on board the evidence of less-favorable supply- side conditions, and monetary policy 
begins tightening late  next year .

Greater Disinflation 
In the baseline, inflation remains relatively stable over the next two years  and then 
begins to rise as unemployment declines in an environment of well-anchored inflation 
expectations.  But the recent stability of various measures of expected inflation may be misleading u s about the potential for further disinflation in  a persistently weak economy .  
In this scenario, actual inflation falls to zero by 2014—a decline that is  in line with the 
predictions of some of our forecasting equations that do not condition on survey measures of expected inflation .  In response, t he federal funds rate lifts off about a year 
later than in the baseline .  This more -accommodative monetary policy eventually  
stimulates aggregate spending, and real GDP expands faster than in the baseline after 2012. 
Higher Inflation   
In the baseline projection, recent large increases in commodity prices have small 
effects on underlying inflation , reflect ing their small share of overall production costs and 
our expectation that commodity prices will not continue to rise at recent rates.   In this 
scenario, continued global demand pressures on commodities instead cause the prices of 
food and energy to climb  rapidly over the next year.   These increases in turn put upward 
pressure on core prices  and wages that are more pronounced than the model would 
ordinarily predict .  As a consequence , core inflation picks up to 1½ percent in 2011 and 
1¾ percent in 2012.  In response to higher inflation, the federal funds rate lifts off in early  
2012.  The tighter monetary policy and a reduction in real wages temper aggregate 
demand, so real GDP expands somewhat more slowly than in the baseline. 
Dollar Depreciation   
A broad range of developments could spur a more sizable dollar decline than 
projected in our baseline forecast, including faster- than-expected foreign growth, 
increased demand for foreign assets, and greater overall risk tolerance as global economic 
conditions improve.  Moreover, a new round of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve may weigh more on the dollar than we assume in the baseline, possibly by reinforcing  the 
perception that monetary policy in the U nited States  is likely to remain accommodative 
for considerably longer than monetary policy abroad.  In this scenario, the broad real 
dollar depreciates 10  percent relative to  baseline by the end of 2011 in response to a risk 
premium adjustment that increases the relative attractiveness of foreign assets.  This 
shock prompts U.S.  real GDP to rise somewhat faster than in the baseline in 2011 and 
2012, as U.S. exports become more price-competitive and as U.S. consumers substitute

toward domestically produced goods.  As a result , the nominal trade balance improves by 
1¼ percent  of GDP by the end of 2011 relative to baseline .  Core PCE inflation rises to 
1½ percent in 2011 in response to higher import prices and great er resource utilization .  
The federal funds rate is modestly  above baseline starting in  mid-2012.  
Asian Currency Appreciation 
Our baseline envisions a gradual appreciation of the Chinese renminbi and other 
Asian emerging market currencies against the doll ar.  However, against the backdrop of 
continued rapid growth, the Chinese authorities may allow significantly faster 
appreciation to damp inflationary pressure and lessen the risk of overheating.  Moreover, the authorities may view faster appreciation as a  desirable way of reducing the mounting 
criticism of China’s currency policy in international circles.  In this scenario, we assume 
that the dollar depreciates about 20 percent against the renminbi relative to baseline by the end of 2011 and about 10 perce nt against other emerging Asian currencies.  These 
declines lower the broad real dollar about 5 percent relative to baseline , boost U.S. real 
net exports, and cause U.S. real GDP growth to rise slightly faster than baseline in 2011 and 2012.  Core PCE pric es rise about ¼  percentage point faster than baseline in 2011, 
and the nominal trade balance improves by about ¾ percent of GDP .  However, the 
stimulus to U.S. GDP might be partly offset by rising term premiums  on U.S. financial 
assets if more -rapid dollar depreciation prompted Asian countries to reduce their 
preferences for U.S. Treasur y securities  and other U.S. instruments .    
OUTSIDE FORECASTS   
 The Blue Chip consensus forecast released in early October  shows real GDP 
increasing at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the second half of 2010 and an average 
of 2.9 percent over the four quarters of 2011, little changed from the September survey.  The consensus for real GDP growth is similar to  the staff’s outlook for the second half of 
this year but weaker next year.  Despite  the weaker forecast for real GDP growth, the 
Blue Chip forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of 2011 is very close to  the 
staff’s projection.  Regarding inflation, the Blue Chip anticipates the CPI increasing 1.7 percent over  the four quarters of 2011, the  same as its projection from a month earlier 
and higher than the staff forecast of 1 .2 percent .  The Blue Chip forecast for short- term 
interest rates ha s continued to move down, further narrowing the difference with the staff 
projection.  The Blue Chip path for long- term interest rate s also has been marked down, 
and is now very similar to the staff projection.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
NAIRU. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionarychanges in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The annual FI estimates are on a calendar year basis. Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicateaggregate demand stimulus.
