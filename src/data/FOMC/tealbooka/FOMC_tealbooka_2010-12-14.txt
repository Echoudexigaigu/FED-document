Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
On balance, the data on real  activity and spending that we  have received since the 
October Tealbook have come in a little better  than expected, suppor ting our view that a 
modest economic recovery is continuing.  Despite a disappointing employment report for 
November, the full range of labor market da ta received since the October projection 
suggests that labor demand is improving at a slig htly faster rate than we were anticipating 
in our previous forecast.  Moreover, the late st indicators of factory output and business 
spending point to a stronger pace of producti on and investment over the second half of 
this year than we were previously projecti ng.  Real consumer spending has also surprised 
us to the upside and appears to be on a so mewhat firmer footing given recent upward 
revisions to the level of personal income.  In contrast, incoming news on the housing 
market has once again come in below our expectations.  On net, we expect that real GDP 
will rise at an annual rate of about 2½ pe rcent in the second half of this year, 
½ percentage point faster than our October Tealbook forecast. 
In this forecast, we have revised our a ssumptions for fiscal policy to reflect the 
recent budget negotiations; this revision adds roughly ½ percentage point to real GDP 
growth in 2011 and deducts a somewhat sma ller amount in 2012.  In addition, the path of 
equity prices is somewhat higher in this forecast.  However, relative to the October 
projection, the other conditioning assumptions are somewhat less favorable, with a 
slightly higher foreign excha nge value of the dollar through next year, higher long-term 
interest rates, and an appreciably lower assumed path for house prices.  The revision to 
house prices is part of a broader rethinking on our part of the outlook for the housing 
market, which, in light of the persistently weak  readings for this sector since midyear, we 
now see as improving much less rapidly than we had previously projected.  Putting all of 
this together and factoring in the effect of the stronger incoming data, we now expect real 
GDP growth of 3¾ percent in 2011 and 4½ percen t in 2012, with the level of real GDP at 
the end of 2012 about unchanged from our October forecast.  With this trajectory for real 
GDP, the unemployment rate declines to just under 9 percent by the end of next year and 
to 8 percent by the end of 2012. 
Our projection for inflation is slightly below that in the previous Tealbook.  
Recent data on core consumer prices have co me in somewhat lower than expected; while 
we think that these lower readings mostly reflect transitory factors, we also see them as

  suggesting a slightly lower pace of underlying in flation.  We project that core PCE prices 
will rise 0.9 percent in both 2011 and 2012, 0.1 percentage point lower in each year than 
in our October forecast.  We expect headline price inflation to edge down from 
1.2 percent in 2010 to 1.1 percent in 2011 and to 0.9 percent in 2012, as energy prices 
decelerate. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
We assume that the FOMC will hold the ta rget federal funds rate in the current 
range of 0 to ¼ percent until the first qua rter of 2013, one quarter longer than was 
assumed in the October Tealbook.  Regardi ng nonconventional policy, we continue to 
assume that the Federal Reserve will expa nd its holdings of Treasury securities by 
purchasing an average of $75 billion per month through the second quarter of 2011, 
bringing the securities holdings in the SOMA portfolio to $2.6 trillion.  In addition, we 
assume that the Federal Reserve will reinvest  principal payments from its securities 
holdings through early 2013.   
Financial Conditions 
Since the October Tealbook, the 10-year Treasury yield has increased about 
50 basis points.  That rise lik ely reflected a downward revision  by market participants of 
the expected size of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, incoming economic data that 
were viewed as favorable on balance, and recen t fiscal policy developments.  At the time 
of the October Tealbook, we believed that inve stors had priced into Treasury yields a 
larger expansion of the balance sheet than the FOMC would adopt; we therefore thought 
that the scaling back of expectations for the program’s size would put additional upward 
pressure on yields in coming m onths.  However, it now appears that this process played 
out much more rapidly than we were anticipat ing.  As a result, we have marked up the 
path of the 10-year Treasury yield, but by more in  the near term than in the medium term.  
As has been true for some time, we expect th at yields will rise fu rther over the next two 
years, mainly reflecting the movement of  the 10-year valuation window through the 
projected period of near-zero short-term interest rates. 
Since late October, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds and interest rates 
on conforming fixed-rate mortgages have increas ed about in line with Treasury yields, 
leaving their implied risk spr eads little changed.  We therefor e left our forecasts for those

  interest rate spreads unrevi sed, and the projected paths fo r highly rated corporate bonds 
and conforming mortgages have been revised up in accord with the revision to the 
10-year Treasury yield. 
The Dow Jones U.S. Stock Market Index is about 3 percent above the level 
anticipated in the October Tealbook, and favor able news about the economy appears to 
have pushed the implied equity risk premiu m down a touch.  Nevertheless, the equity 
premium remains well above longer-run norms.  We expect stock prices to increase at an 
annual rate of about 11 percent over the next  two years as the r ecovery proceeds and 
financial market participants gradually beco me less concerned about risk, thereby causing 
the implied equity premium to fall back  toward a more typical level.   
Readings on home prices have been w eaker than we expected in the October 
Tealbook, and as part of our more downbeat assessment of the state of the housing 
market, we have marked down the projected path  of home prices over the medium term.  
In particular, we now expect these prices to decrease 5¾ pe rcent this year and 2¾ percent 
in 2011, then to level off in 2012.  As a result,  the projected level of  home prices at the 
end of 2012 is nearly 8 percent below th e level in the October Tealbook forecast.  
Fiscal Policy 
Our assumptions about federal fiscal policy have changed from the October 
Tealbook to reflect the major components of  the compromise agreement between the 
President and congressional Republicans.  In particular, our forecast now includes a 
temporary reduction in employee payroll taxes equal to 2 percent of taxable wages in 
2011 and a provision that allows businesses to fully expense their qualified investment 
spending next year.  Regarding other elements  of the agreement, we had already been 
assuming that all of the provisions of the 2001–03 tax cuts—including those for high-
income individuals—would be extend ed through 2012, and that the Emergency 
Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program  would be extended through 2011.  We 
also now assume a pay freeze for civilian fe deral employees in 2011 and 2012.  All told, 
we now project that total discretionary fede ral fiscal policy actions will have roughly a 
neutral effect on aggregate demand in 2011 but will impose a drag of about 1 percent on real GDP in 2012 as the effect s of stimulus policies wane. 
Our new policy assumptions imply a forecast for the unified budget deficit that is 
a little larger than the Oct ober projection.  The budget defi cit for fiscal year 2010 was 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
December 8, 2010
Page 4 of 100
   
  $1.3 trillion (around 9 percent of GDP), and we expect it to tick up to $1.4 trillion in 
fiscal 2011.  The budget deficit is anticipate d to narrow to $1.1 trillion in fiscal 2012 
(around 7 percent of GDP), primarily reflecting the further winding down of stimulus-
related policies and the higher revenues a ssociated with a faster pace of economic 
activity. 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar  
Following a significant slowing in the thir d quarter, we expect foreign real GDP 
growth to increase to an annual rate of about 2¾ percent in th e current quarter.  Over the 
next two years, we project foreign output to accelerate a bit further, with real GDP 
expanding 3½ percent in 2012.  This outlook is little changed from our October 
projection.  In reaction to the renewed financial stresses in Europe, we have marked down 
our forecast for economic activity in the peri pheral euro-area countries.  This downward 
revision, however, has been largely offs et by a more buoyant outlook for Germany, 
where strong incoming data and the stimula tive effects of euro depreciation point to 
continued resilience. 
Since the October Tealbook, the dollar has appreciated about ¾ percent on a real, 
trade-weighted basis against a broad set of currencies.  In 2011 and 2012, we expect the 
real dollar to depreciate about 3 percent per ye ar on average, a slightly faster pace than 
we assumed in the previous Tealbook.  This  higher rate of depr eciation reflects two 
adjustments to our outlook.  Fi rst, the anticipated market disappointment we had built 
into the October forecast regarding the scale of the FOMC’s asset purchases appears to 
have already occurred; this development remove s a factor that slowed the projected pace 
of dollar depreciation in the previous projec tion.  Second, we now assume that with the 
exception of China, governments in emergi ng Asia will allow their currencies to 
appreciate at slightly fast er rates going forward.  Rela tive to the October Tealbook, the 
incoming data and these adjustments leave the path of the broad real  dollar a little higher 
through the end of 2011; thereafter, the faster  rate of depreciation pushes the dollar’s 
exchange value slightly be low our previous assumption. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
Oil prices climbed sharply following the November FOMC announcement, but 
then fell back on concerns over financial stre ss in Europe and tighter monetary policy in 
China.  More recently, incoming data pointing to stronger-than-expected global manufacturing activity have pushed near-term prices higher.  On net, the spot price of 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Page 5 of 100
   
  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil has m oved up about $6.50 per barrel since the 
October Tealbook, closing most recently on D ecember 7 at $88.69 per barrel.  With a 
much flatter futures curve, we now project th e spot price of WTI to  change little over the 
forecast period, ending 2012 at about $90 per barrel—up $1.50 from our previous 
forecast. 
Since the October Tealbook, nonfuel commod ity prices have moved up modestly, 
with metals prices, like oil prices, responding to prospects for global activity, and with 
prices for food and other agricultural co mmodities up on largely idiosyncratic supply 
developments.  We project that nonfuel comm odity prices will show an increase of 
9½ percent (not at an an nual rate) in the current quarter; most of this increase reflects 
price movements seen prior to the Octobe r Tealbook, and this rise is only about 
2 percentage points above our October forecas t.  Consistent with quotes from futures 
markets, we project that nonfuel commodity pr ices will edge higher during the first half 
of 2011 before declining slightly in  the second half and throughout 2012.  
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
On balance, the data on real  activity and spending that we  have received since the 
October Tealbook have come in somewhat strong er than expected.  We now project that 
real GDP will increase at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second half of this year, 
½ percentage point above our October forecast.   In addition, the fo recast now shows real 
GDP rising at a 3½ percent pace in the first quarter of 2011, ¾ percentage point above the 
October projection. 
Labor Markets 
Since the October Tealbook, we receive d both a stronger-than-expected labor 
market report for October and a weaker-than- expected report for November.  On net, 
private nonfarm employers added an averag e of 105,000 jobs per month in October and 
November; together with upward revisions to earlier months, these job gains left the 
November level of private payroll employme nt more than 130,000 above our forecast in 
the October Tealbook.  Reflecting the ongoing tepid pace of hiring, the unemployment 
rate rose to 9.8 percent in November afte r having held steady at 9.6 percent over the 
preceding three months. 
Other indicators of labor ma rket activity point to a further gradual pickup in 
employment growth in coming months.  Layo ff indicators, such as initial claims for

  unemployment insurance, have edged lower; likewise, measures of job openings and 
hiring have been trending up slowly.  In addition, the average workweek, which often 
moves up ahead of a pickup in hiring, has c ontinued to edge higher on net in recent 
months.  As a result, we project that pr ivate job growth will be 125,000 in December and 
will average 180,000 per month in the first qua rter, with an average first-quarter 
unemployment rate of 9.5 percent. 
The Industrial Sector 
Although industrial production (IP) was flat in October and has changed little, on 
net, since July, these readings were held down by weather-related declines in utilities 
output.  By contrast, manufact uring output has increased so mewhat more than we had 
expected, with production gains fairly wide spread across industries.  Nevertheless, 
manufacturing IP has still decelerated noticea bly relative to the first half of the year, 
reflecting a diminished impetus to producti on from inventory rebui lding.  Looking ahead, 
indicators of industrial activity are consistent with moderate gains in factory output in the 
near term, while assembly schedules point to  additional increases in  motor vehicle output 
following November’s production cuts.  In tota l, we now expect manufacturing output to 
rise at an annual rate of 3¾ percent in the cu rrent quarter, in contrast to the small decline 
we were projecting in the October Tealbook.  We are also looking for a 5½ percent gain 
in the first quarter of 2011, led by a sharp increase in motor vehicle production. 
Household Spending 
Real consumer spending rose at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the third quarter, 
and we expect a similar gain in the current  quarter.  Real sp ending in the control 
category, which includes food services and most non-auto goods, rose ½ percent in 
October, and, smoothing through the month-to-month volatility, has shown solid gains throughout the year.  In addi tion, outlays for motor vehicles and non-energy services—
two categories that had been recovering mo re slowly than others—have picked up 
somewhat since midyear.  As a result, real PCE is projected to accelerate over the second 
half of this year to an average rate that is nearly ½ percentage poi nt stronger than our 
October Tealbook projection.  The higher proj ected level of spending over the second 
half of this year has been accompanied by an upward revision to the reported level of 
personal income.  In addition, the proposed payr oll tax cut would raise disposable income 
starting in January and is estimated to add roughly ¾ pe rcentage point to spending 
growth in the first quarter of 2011, bringing the projected increase in real consumer 
spending in that quarter to 3¼ percent.

  Although a variety of transito ry factors have made the recent data on home sales 
more difficult to interpret than usual, th e underlying level of housing demand does not 
appear to be picking up, contra ry to what we were antici pating in previous Tealbooks.  
Moreover, the latest data on housing construc tion indicate that bui lding activity remains 
exceptionally weak.  Although recent data on single-family starts have come in close to 
our expectations, permit issuance has remained below starts for several months, which we 
have interpreted as suggesting a noticeably sl ower rate of improvement in homebuilding 
going forward than we had been forecasting.  In support of this view, industry sources 
indicate that they expect little acceleration in housing activ ity over the coming year.  In 
all, we anticipate that real re sidential investment will decline at an annual rate of nearly 
4 percent in the current quarter—not very different from our Oc tober projection—but we 
have reduced our forecast for residential investment growth in the first quarter of 2011 by 
10 percentage points, to 3 percent at an annual rate. 
Business Investment 
Real spending on equipment and software  (E&S) appears to have decelerated 
noticeably in the second half of this year from its rapid first-half pace.  That said, the rise 
in E&S spending in the third quarter—at an a nnual rate of 16 per cent—was larger than 
we had anticipated, reflecting sizable gains in outlays for trans portation equipment and 
for high-tech goods.  Outside of transportati on and high-tech, third-quarter outlays for 
other equipment increased a little less than  we were expecting, and recent declines in 
orders and shipments of nondefense capital good s point to a further moderation in this 
category of equipment investment in coming m onths.  As a result, we expect real E&S 
spending to post annualized increases of 5¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 
9½ percent in the first quarter of 2011, clos e to our forecast in the October Tealbook. 
Business outlays on nonresidential structures have continued to move lower, as 
additional declines in building construction have more than o ffset increases in spending 
on drilling and mining structures.  While the downtrend in construction outlays on 
buildings appears to have slowed somewhat , an overhang of unoccupied space and tight 
lending conditions continue to weigh on this sector, and we expect outlays on building 
construction to decline furthe r in coming months.  By cont rast, elevated energy prices 
should sustain solid increases in drilling a nd mining expenditures through the near term. 
Although real inventory investment rose sharply in the thir d quarter, at this point 
the available indicators do not suggest that th e current level of stocks  is excessive in the

  aggregate:  Although inventory-sales ratios have edged up, survey data imply that few 
businesses perceive inventory stocks as being too high.  Th e staff’s flow-of-goods system 
also suggests that inventory positions for most sectors are in a comfortable range, 
although there are signs of imbalances in a fe w categories such as construction materials, 
chemicals, and primary metals. 
In the motor vehicle sector, dealer stocks of light vehicles have receded since the 
end of the third quarter and are expected to  decline further through the end of the year 
before turning up in the first quarter of 2011.  Outside of motor vehicles, we expect the 
pace of stockbuilding to ease a b it in the fourth and first quarters as firms increase their 
inventories in line with sales growth.  On ne t, after contributing 1½ percentage points to 
real GDP growth in the third quarter, total i nventory investment is projected to subtract 
about 1½ percentage points from the rate of ch ange of real GDP this quarter and to have 
essentially no effect on real growth in the firs t quarter of 2011. 
Government 
Real federal purchases increased at an annua l rate of 9 percent in the third quarter, 
with both defense and nondefense spending rising  briskly.  We project  that growth in 
federal purchases will slow to 2 percent in th e fourth quarter and to 1 percent in the first 
quarter of 2011, reflecting a deceleration in  both defense and nondefense expenditures. 
Real state and local purchase s edged up at an annual rate of ¾ percent in the third 
quarter, as reductions in empl oyment, which were especially  large in local education, 
were offset by a sharp rise in construction spending.  We expect total state and local 
spending to be little changed, on net, th rough the first quarter of next year. 
Foreign Trade 
After rising at a robust annua l rate of 16½ percent in th e third quarter, we project 
that real imports will register  a decline of 4 percen t in the current quarter and an increase 
of 4¾ percent in the first quart er of next year.  This swi ng in the quarterly pattern of 
imports partly reflects problems with the BE A’s seasonal adjustment of oil prices, which 
is projected to depress imports in the fourth quarter after boosting them in the third quarter.  We also expect a sh arp deceleration in n onoil imports this quarter, as we believe 
that the vigorous rebound from th e steep declines of the crisis  has largely run its course.  
(See the box “What Explains the Recent Strength of Imports?” for additional detail.)  Compared with the October Tealbook, our  outlook for import growth is about

  1 percentage point lower in the current quarter and 1¾ per centage points higher in the 
first quarter of next year, which partly reflects our re action to incoming data from the 
Department of Energy on oil imports.  Mean while, exports of goods and services are 
expected to accelerate from a third-quarter p ace of 6¼ percent to 8¼ percent in both the 
current quarter and the first quart er of next year, as foreign economic growth strengthens.  
Our projection for export growth is a bit lower than in the October Tealbook, in part 
because of the higher assumed exchange value of the dollar. 
In all, we expect net exports to cont ribute 1¾ percentage points to real GDP 
growth in the current quarter— thus reversing the negative contribution made in the third 
quarter—as exports accelerate a nd imports decline.  In the first quarter of next year, the 
resumption of import growth should reduce the contribution of net exports to GDP 
growth to ¼ percentage point.  Relative to the previous Tealbook, net exports make 
roughly the same contribution to GDP growth in the current quarter; in the first quarter of 2011, the contribution is about ¼ percentage point smaller. 
Prices and Wages 
Recent data on core inflation have come in  lower than we were expecting in the 
October Tealbook.  Core PCE pri ce inflation was 0.8 percent at an annual rate in the third 
quarter, 0.2 percentage point below our Octobe r projection.  In addi tion, core PCE prices 
were unchanged in October, which reduced our forecast for core PCE inflation in the 
fourth quarter to 0.6 percent, down ½ percentage point from our previous projection.  A 
large portion of these low recent readings appears to reflect transitory factors.  In the third 
quarter, the revision to inflati on is mainly attributable to an unexpected decline in the 
volatile nonmarket component of PCE prices th at we do not expect to  persist.  In the 
fourth quarter, the inflation surp rise is largely attributable to  a drop in prices for medical 
services and to weaker goods prices.  Howe ver, the downward surpri se in medical price 
inflation reflects an outsized annual adjust ment to Medicare ho spital reimbursement 
rates, and we still anticipate that higher import prices will put so me upward pressure on 
goods prices.  Nonetheless, we have taken a small signal from the recent soft inflation 
data.  All told, we expect core  PCE inflation to move back to  an annual rate of 1 percent 
in the first quarter of 2011; this pace is a touc h lower than the one seen over the first half 
of 2010, and is slightly lower than in our October forecast. 
We project that total PCE price inflation will move up from an annual rate of 
1 percent in the third quarter to 1¾ percent in the current quarter, mainly reflecting an

 What Explains the Recent Strength  of Imports?  
Real imports surged at an annual  rate of 25 percent on average in the second and 
third quarters  of this year, while U.S.  real GDP expanded  at only a 2¼ percent 
pace.1   Part of the strength  of imports can be explained  by the composition  of 
the increase in  domestic demand,  with relatively  robust gains in demand for 
goods, the  most import intensive  component  of spending.   In particular,  as 
shown in  the lower‐ left figure, private domestic demand  for goods, defined  as 
the sum of personal  consu mption expenditures  on goods, investment  in 
equipment and  software, and  the change in private inventories, increased  at an 
annual rate of 11 percent on average in the second and third quarters  of this year, 
exceeding  the overall rise in real GDP by  almost 9 percentage points.  
However, even  relative to th e expansion  in private domestic demand  for goods,  
the surge in imports appears outsized.   As shown by  the red line in the lower‐
right figure, import  penetration—the  ratio of imports to domestic demand—
increased  sharply in the manufacturing  sector in recent quarters.   This rise 
appears primarily  to be a rebound  from the steep decline experien ced during the 
recession.   Indeed, by  this metric, imports  now appear to have recovered to their  
pre‐crisis trend, an upward  trajectory  driven primarily  by increased  globalization.

Bureau of Economic  Analysis for the seasonal adjustment  of prices for imported  petroleum.  
However,  even absent this artificial boost, imports  were exceptionally  strong.

 Moreover,  the sizable rise  in imports has not prevented  domestic production  
from increasing  as well.  Looking  across 21  disaggregated  manufacturing  sectors, 
the figure below reveals that sectors with larger  increases  in import penetration 
have also generally  recorded  larger increases  in industrial  production  since the 
business cycle trough.   This correlation  suggests that the increase in  imports 
likely reflects the ongoing recovery of  demand,  as demand for domestic 
production  has increased  as well.   
Taken together,  the evidence suggests  that the recent surge in imports has 
largely reflected  a rebound  from depressed levels during  the crisis.  Historically,  
imports have exhibited  greater cyclical volatility  than GDP, in part because of  the 
greater volati lity of demand for goods,  which are more likely to be imported.  
Just as this factor contributed  to the plunge in imports during the recession,  it 
has contributed  to the recent surge.   In our forecast,  we project that  the rebound  
in imports has largely run its course, as the growth in demand for goods  slows 
and also because we  do not expect import penetration to continue  to rise at the 
pace of recent quarters.   Accordingly, we  are projecting  a significant step ‐down 
in import growth, to a rate more  in line with the projected  pace of expansion  in 
U.S. economic  activity.

  acceleration in energy prices.  Energy inflati on is expected to move lower in the first 
quarter of 2011; its effects are partly offset by the projected acceleration in core prices, 
and so headline inflation edges lower to 1½ percent. 
Measures of long-term inflation expecta tions have not changed significantly since 
the October Tealbook.  Median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflati on expectations from the 
November Reuters/University of Michig an Surveys of Consumers remained at 
2.8 percent, in the middle of the narrow range seen over the past few years.  Median 
expected long-run PCE inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters edged down 
to 2 percent in the fourth quarter, in part be cause of a change in the group of forecasters 
in the survey panel.  Finally, the TIPS-b ased five-year forward rate of inflation 
compensation has edged up si nce the end of October. 
Changes in labor compensation have re mained subdued overall, though there have 
been some upward revisions from the last Tealbook.  The source data for the BEA’s wage and salary estimates imply an upward revision to second-quarter labor compensation; 
accordingly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics  now estimates that compensation per hour 
increased nearly 3 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter.  In addition, the level 
of average hourly earnings thus far in the f ourth quarter has been a little higher than we 
were expecting, and we now anticipate that hourly compensation will rise at an annual 
rate of 2¼ percent in the second half of the year, which is ¼ percentage point faster than 
our October Tealbook projection.  As in our October forecast, we expect that the 
annualized rate of increase  of hourly compensation will be temporarily boosted to 
2½ percent in the first quarte r of 2011 by an increase in empl oyer contributions to state 
unemployment insurance funds.  With these compensation ga ins, unit labor costs rise 
½ percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year, with a similar increase 
expected in the first quarter of 2011. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
We have edged up our projection for real GDP growth by 0.1 percentage point in 
2011, to 3¾ percent, and lowered real growth in 2012 by ¼ percentage point, to 
4½ percent.  These revisions reflect the interplay of several factors. 
First, the assumed changes to the payro ll tax and business expensing allowances 
temporarily boost real consumption and busine ss equipment spending.  In total, these tax

  changes are projected to add ½ percentage point to real GDP growth in 2011 and to 
deduct a somewhat smaller amount from 2012. 
Second, we have become more pessimistic about the prospects for the housing 
market.  Since last summer the incoming data on housing activity have repeatedly 
surprised us to the downside, and we now think that the substa ntial excess supply of 
vacant homes will likely be a larger and more persistent drag on construction and house 
prices than we had previously thought.  In  addition, impediments to the availability of 
mortgage credit and uncertainty about the fu ture path of house prices appear to be 
depressing demand to a greater extent than we had anticipated.  Nevertheless, we still 
expect residential constructi on activity to pick up over the projection period as these 
factors weighing on demand diminish and improvements in real income and employment act to lift housing demand.  Hence, our forecast now calls for single-family starts to rise 
from 430,000 units in the fourth  quarter of 2010 to 520,000 units in the fourth quarter of 
2011 (roughly 200,000 units below the pace projected in the October Tealbook), with a further increase to 660,000 units by the end of 2012 (almost 350,000 units below the 
October Tealbook pace). 
We have also assumed a modestly stronge r exchange value of the dollar for the 
next several quarters, which implies a slightly  smaller impetus from the foreign sector.  
Net exports contribute about ¼ percentage poin t to real GDP growth in 2011 and almost 
nothing to growth in 2012.  Strong foreign GDP growth, the lagged effect of previous declines in the dollar, and further anticipa ted dollar depreciation w ill help support export 
growth going forward, while import demand is projected to pick up as U.S. GDP 
accelerates. 
Although these revisions result  in a slightly flatter c ontour of real GDP growth 
over the medium term, the basic dynamics of the projected recovery  in real activity 
remain essentially the same.  Specifically, we  continue to expect aggregate demand to 
improve for several reasons:  The drag from earlier declines in wealth diminishes, 
financial conditions remain supportive and lending standards ease further, household and 
business confidence rises, and the labor market  gradually recovers.  Working against this 
improvement in demand is a large overhang of residential and commercial real estate, the 
waning of federal fiscal stimulus, budgetary pressures on state and local governments, 
and continued credit constraints due in part  to the medium-term effects of financial 
regulatory reform. (See the box “The Macroecono mic Effect of Basel III Requirements.”)

 The  Macroeconomic  Effect  of Basel  III Requirements  
During the global financial crisis that began in  mid‐ 2007, many systemically  important  financial 
institutions  came under significant  market pressure  because they  were seen as having 
insufficient  capital and access to liquidity  to withstand  the stresses that emerged.   As a result, 
the international  regulatory  community  began a reassessment  of capital and liquidity standards,  
the details of which have taken shape in  recent months.  Banking  institutions  will be expected  
to hold substantially  higher levels of capital, especially  common equity  capital, which is most 
capable of  absorbing  losses and  limiting spillovers  to other institutions.   In addition,  a 
requirement  for coverage  of potential  short‐term liquidity needs will become effective  in 2015 
following  an observation period  during which regulators  can further assess the  implications  of 
the proposed  standard. 
Under the new  capital framework,  the amount of required  capital relative to risk‐weighted  
assets increases  and the risk weights  applied to assets  are adjusted  to better  reflect underlying  
risk.  In both cases, the changes  are implemented  gradually  over the  coming decade.  For  
example,  the required  minimum  level of common equity  relative to risk‐weighted  assets is 
slated to rise from 2 percent currently  to 3.5 percent  in 2013 and 4.5 percent by 2015 (see table  
on facing page).  Requirements  for Tier 1  capital will also increase ove r time, from 4 percent 
currently  to 6 percent by 2015.  In addition,  the new framework  includes a capital conservation 
buffer on  top of the required  minimum  level of common equity:   Institutions  whose level of 
common equity  is above the required  minimum  but within this  buffer range will face  restrictions  
on, for example,  dividend  payments  and compensation  practices.  This  buffer rises  slowly after 
2015, pushing  the combination  of regulatory  minimum  and conservation  buffer for common 
equity to 7 percent of  assets by the beginning  of 2019. 
Several considerations  suggest that the medium‐term effects of the new capital framework  on 
credit availability  and real activity  are likely to prove  modest and are consistent  with the staff’s 
outlook.   A factor mitigating  the potential  drag on activity is the improvement in  banks’ capital  
positions  that has occurred  since the onset  of the crisis, as illustrated  in the figure by the 
increase in  the ratio of  Tier 1 capital to risk‐ weighted  assets for large  banks (at the bank level).  
Despite this improvement,  some banks may wish to increase their  level of capital relative to 
assets further to maintain  an adequate discretionary  buffer above regulatory  requirements, 
consistent  with their  past behavior.   Moreover,  there  is substantial  heterogeneity  in bank 
positions  and some large bank holding companies  will likely  need to accumulate  additional  
capital to meet the  new requirements.  Nonetheless, many  institutions  will be able to meet such 
needs, for the most  part, through retained  earnings,  and we do not anticipate  significant  
downward  pressure  on bank lending.   
This evaluation  seems broadly consistent  with views  among financial market participants—such  
as reports from industry analysts suggesting  that the requirements  are less stringent  than 
originally  anticipated—and  with findings  in related research.  For  example,  a coordinated  
international  research effort suggested  that an increase in required  capital of 3 to 4 percent of 
risk‐weighted  assets imple mented over  a four‐year period  would likely lower the  level of U.S. 
real GDP by  roughly ¾ percent over the  course of several years,  implying  modest year‐ to‐year

 effects.1  That said, this  research  also pointed to downside  risks to this  assessment  if banks were 
to feel competitive  pressure  to raise capital more quickly than required  or if the overall 
macroeconomic  environment  weakened  banks’ ability  to meet capital  needs through retained  
earnings or resulted in further capital losses.  In such  adverse scenarios, the  drag on real activity  
could prove several times  as large as we currently  anticipate.  
The introduction  of liquidity requirements, in  the form of a liquidity  coverage  ratio (LCR),  should 
help ensure that banks adequately  manage their exposures  to liquidity  risk and also help the 
authorities  to manage the orderly resolution  of insol vent institutions.   The LCR  requires an 
institution  to have enough unencumbered,  high‐quality liquid assets to cover, at  a minimum, the  
institution’s  projected  net cash outflows  over a 30‐ day horizon under a stress scenario  that 
combines  a substantial  idiosyncratic  shock with a moderate systemic disturbance.   Moreover,  
the stress scenario  penalizes  a variety  of short‐term  commitments,  such as lines of credit for 
financial institutions  and back‐up lines for commercial  paper programs, which will make  pricing 
of such programs  significantly  less attractive.   Banks may also face higher funding costs as a 
result of the LCR, part of which they would pass on to loan customers.  As  a result, borrowing  
costs for the  nonfinancial  business sector are likely to increase somewhat,  implying  a small drag  
on real GDP.    
Perhaps 
a more substantial  concern about the  LCR is its effect on financial stability.   While the 
new liquidity requirements  probably  will discourage  banks from providing credit lines without 
adequate resources  to meet potential  draws, the higher cost to banks  of providing  such 
services is likely to push some of these activities  outside of  the regulated  financial sector, where  
they are more difficult to monitor  and where liquidity  crises may be more costly to address.   
Moreover,  once banking  institutions  are subject to the  LCR, in financial crises they would 
presumably  demand an increased  buffer of  liquid assets above the level  required  to satisfy  the 
regulatory  requirement.   Without  an increase in  liquidity provided  by the central bank, the result 
would likely be significant  pressures  in funding market s despite the LCR.

  While we do not think that these negative factors will be sufficient to derail the recovery, 
they do combine to yield a cyclical rebound that is much more subdued than would 
ordinarily be expected given the depth of the preceding recession. 
The projected acceleration in consumer spending reflects many of the forces that 
we anticipate will drive the broader economic recovery, in cluding steadily improving 
credit conditions, a faster pace of job crea tion, an accompanying increase in confidence 
about employment and income prospects, a nd a diminished drag from earlier wealth 
declines.  Next year, we exp ect real consumption to rise 3½ percent, ½ percentage point 
above our October Tealbook forecast.  In  2012, consumption is projected to rise 
4 percent; this rate of growth is ½ percentage poin t below the October Tealbook 
projection, reflecting the conse quences of the lower assumed path of house prices for 
household wealth and the expiration of the 2011 payroll tax reduction.  The saving rate is 
projected to rise from 5½ percent at the end of 2010 to 6¼ percent at the end of next year; 
thereafter, the saving rate drops  back to 5½ percent in 2012. 
Similarly, outlays on equipment and softwa re are projected to post solid gains—
more than 10 percent per year on average ove r the next couple of years—as rising sales 
and improved business confidence induce firms to replace aging capital and expand their 
capacity.  In addition, investment demand shoul d continue to be boosted by an increasing 
willingness of firms to undertake investment  projects that were postponed during the 
recession.  Finally, we expect that the new expensing provisions will slightly raise the 
rate of growth of equipment investment  in 2011 and reduce its growth rate in 2012. 
High vacancy rates, low commercial pr operty prices, and persistent tight 
borrowing conditions for commercial real estate  are expected to significantly restrain 
nonresidential constructi on.  We therefore expect investme nt in nonresidential structures 
to decline until the end of 2012, albeit at a slower pace than over the past year. 
Finally, government purchases are projecte d to make only a small contribution to 
real GDP growth over the medium term.  Reductions in spending related to overseas 
military operations and the phasing out of stimulus-related nondefense spending are expected to hold the increase in  real federal expenditures to 1 percent next year and to 
¼ percent in 2012.  Meanwhile, state and local governments will likely see only a modest easing in budgetary pressures as a cyclical in crease in revenues is offset by an unwinding 
in federal stimulus grants.  As a result, real spending by these jurisdic tions is projected to 
rise just ½ percent in 2011 and 1¼ percent in 2012.

  AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU 
We have made no material change to our estimates of potential GDP in this 
projection and assume that potential output will rise 2.5 percent in 2011 and 2.6 percent 
in 2012.  Similarly, our assumed NAIRU rema ins at 6 percent throughout 2012, the same 
as in the October projection. 
Productivity and the Labor Market 
Given the modest changes that we made to our forecast of real activity, the 
projected dynamics of the labor market recove ry are very similar to the October Tealbook 
forecast.  In particular, we believe that th e gap between actual labor productivity and its 
structural level that opened up last year will continue to narrow over the medium term as 
firms add workers both to meet rising produc tion needs and to reli eve pressures on their 
existing workforces.  Our forecast therefore calls for employment growth to pick up 
steadily over the projection pe riod and for actual labor produc tivity to rise 1¾ percent 
next year and 2 percent in 2012, on average a lit tle less than our estimate of its structural 
growth rate. 
The level of private employment in this forecast is also little changed from the 
October Tealbook.  We project that privat e employment gains will average about 
230,000 per month in 2011 and 280,000 per month in 2012.  With this pace of job 
growth, we expect the unemployment rate to decline from 9¾ percent in the current 
quarter to 8 percent by the end of 2012. 
Resource Utilization 
The amount of current and projected slack  remains very large in this Tealbook 
forecast.  By our estimate, the unemployment rate in the current quarter is about 3 percentage points above the effective NAIRU ; at the end of the projection period, the 
unemployment gap is 2 percentage points.
1  This extended period of  labor market slack is 
likely to be associated with other features of a weak labor market, including below-trend 
labor force participation, a high percentage of workers who are involuntarily on part-time 
                                                 
1 The effective NAIRU includes the effect of extended and emergency unemployment benefits (EEB), 
and is the level of the unemployment rate that we vi ew as being consistent with no slack in resource 
utilization.  As the EEB programs are phased out, the effective NAIRU declines from its current level of 
6¾ percent to around 6 percent by the end of 2012.

  schedules, and an unusually la rge concentration of worker s experiencing long-duration 
unemployment spells. 
The projected GDP gap narrows from nega tive 6½ percent in the current quarter 
to negative 3¾ percent by the end of 2012.  We continue to expect that the GDP gap will 
close more slowly than the rate at which unused  plant capacity in the industrial sector is 
taken up, in part because manuf acturing capacity expands slowly  over the forecast period.  
Indeed, by the end of 2012, our projection calls for the factory operating rate to approach 
its long-run average despite the still-sizab le output gap preva iling at that time. 
Compensation and Prices 
We expect that the wide margin of labor market slack, together with low rates of 
price inflation, will continue to restrain la bor costs over the projection period.  In our 
forecast, the Productivity and Cost measure of nonfarm hourly compensation rises about 
2 percent per year in 2011 and 2012, while th e employment cost in dex increases at a 
roughly similar rate.  Combined with the mode rate gains in productivity  that we project, 
these increases in compensation imply nearly flat unit labor costs over the medium term. 
Prices of imported core goods (all goods  excluding computers, semiconductors, 
and fuels) are expected to rise at an average annual rate of about 5 percent in the current 
quarter and first quarter of next year, boos ted by commodity price increases, previous 
declines in the exchange value of the dollar, and a near-ter m pickup in foreign inflation.  
Our forecast calls for core import price inflat ion to decline to about 1½ percent over the 
remainder of the medium term; this slow down reflects an assumed deceleration in 
commodity prices, lower rates of foreign infl ation, and only a modest depreciation of the 
dollar.  Although higher core import prices  are expected to make a small positive 
contribution to core PCE inflation in the near  term, their influence diminishes to zero by 
the end of the forecast period. 
As in previous Tealbooks, we  anticipate that reduced la bor cost pressures and low 
levels of resource utilizati on will put downward pressure on core PCE inflation over the 
projection period, but that further disinflation will be check ed by continued stability in 
inflation expectations.  We now project that core PCE inflation will be 0.9 percent in 
2011 and 2012, which is 0.1 percentage point below the October Tealbook forecast in 
each year.  As noted previously, this small downward revision reflects our view that the 
recent data on core prices suggest that the rate of underlying inflation is a touch lower

 What Do Different  Measures  of Underlying  Inflat ion Say  
about  the Degree  of Deceleration  in Prices? 
Transitory  factors often obscure the underlying  trend in overall price inflation.   To 
mitigate this problem, economists  use various techniques  to screen out  the noise in the 
data.  Thus, the staff closely monitors  a variety  of measures,  including  versions of both 
CPI and PCE price inflation that exclude food and energy prices and trimmed‐mean 
measures,  which exclude a certain percentage  of price changes from both ends of the 
distribution  of price changes.1  
As shown in  the top and middle figures on the facing page, all of these measures  of 
underlying  inflation have declined  considerably  since  the onset of the recent recession:   
Excluding  food and energy, the CPI and PCE price indexes (the black solid lines) increased  
at a rate of  less than  1 percent over the  12 months ended in October,  down from about 
2½ percent over the 12 months prior to the  recession.   Similarly,  market‐based core PCE 
price inflation (the solid red line in the middle figure)—which also  excludes  the so‐called 
“non‐market” components  of PCE prices that are generally not  based on detailed 
consumer  or producer  price indexes—has  declined  steadily since late 2007  and is also 
now running about 1½ percentage points  below its pre‐recession rate.   Even excluding  
the prices of housing services (rent of tenant‐ and owner‐occupied  housing),  both CPI 
and market‐based PCE prices excluding  food and ener gy (the red dashed lines) have 
decelerated  noticeably.  
The decline in the trimmed ‐mean measures  of inflation (the green lines)  has been even 
more pronounced.   The 12‐month change in both the trimmed‐mean CPI  and the trimmed‐ 
mean PCE  price index has fallen from  a little less than  3 percent  at the end of 2007 to 
about ¾ percent in October of  this year.   
Another way of illustrating  the breadth of the deceleration in  prices over the  last three 
years is through a diffusion  index; such indexes  capture the  prevalence of  price increases  
rather than their average intensity.   The diffusion  index of PCE price changes (two 
versions of which are shown in the bottom figure) is the share of component  price 
indexes that have increased  minus the share that have decreased  over the  past 
12 months.  As can be seen, these indexes  have stepped down noticeably  since the end  
of 2007.   
Thus, even though underlying  inflation can be measured  in many different ways, all  these 
metrics show a decline  in underlying inflation  over the past few years.   
 
                                                 
1 The trimmed‐mean CPI, constructed  by the Federal  Reserve Bank of Cleveland,  excludes 8 percent 
from the bottom of the distribution  and 8 percent from the top of the distribution.   The trimmed‐mean 
PCE price  index, constructed  by the Federal  Reserve Bank  of Dallas, excludes the bottom 24 percent of 
the distribution  and the top 31 perce n t of the distribution.

  than we previously thought.  With energy pr ices expected to decelerate, headline PCE 
inflation is projected to converge to core inflation over the medium term. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2015 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assessments of long-run supply- side conditions, fisc al policy, and other factors.  The 
contour of the long-run outlook depe nds on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long 
run, consistent with th e majority of longer-term inflation projections 
provided by FOMC participants at the November meeting. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities follow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B.  We assume that the projected decline in 
the System’s holdings beginning in 2013 will contribute about 25 basis points to the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield over the 2013–15 period.  
 Beyond 2012, risk premiums on corporate equities decline gradually to 
normal levels, and banks ease their lendi ng standards somewhat further.   
 The federal government budget deficit narrows to about 4½ percent of 
GDP by the end of 2015.  This improvement reflects the effects of the economic recovery on tax receipts and transfer payments as well as further policy actions after 2012 aime d at reducing the deficit. 
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate 
1 percent per year in the 2013–15 peri od.  The price of WTI crude oil 
stays roughly flat at around $90 per barrel through the end of 2015, 
consistent with futures prices.  U nder these assumptions, movements in 
the prices of energy and imports have only minor implications for domestic inflation in the extensi on.  Foreign real GDP expands, on 
average, about 3¼ percent per ye ar from 2013 through 2015, a bit above 
its trend rate. 
 Over the 2013–15 period, the NAIRU declines from 6 percent to 
5¼ percent, as the functioning of the labor market improves.  Potential 
GDP expands 3 percent per year , on average, from 2013 to 2015.

  The economy enters 2013 with the staff’s estimate of the output gap quite wide, 
the unemployment rate well above the estimate d NAIRU, and inflation very low.  In the 
long-run projection, however, improving confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and 
supportive financial conditions eventually enab le the level of aggregate demand to catch 
up with aggregate supply and in flation to move noticeably clos er to its desired level.  
Specifically, the extended forecast shows real GDP rising at an annual rate of 4¾ percent 
on average in 2013 and 2014, considerably faster  than its potential pace; as a result, 
unemployment declines appreciably and inflation begins to rise slowly.  In response, the 
federal funds rate begins to increase in th e first quarter of 2013 and reaches 3¼ percent 
by late 2014.2  By 2015, with improvements in confidence and financial conditions 
largely complete, and with the federal funds ra te climbing further to 4 percent, gains in 
real GDP moderate substantially.  Neverthe less, overall economic growth remains robust 
enough relative to potential to reduce the une mployment rate to the NAIRU by late 2015; 
in addition, inflation continues to  rise and reaches 1½ percent. 
                                                 
2 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate fo llows the prescriptions of the “outcome-based” rule, 
described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.

International  Economic  Developments and Outlook  
The main development in the foreign economies since the October Tealbook has 
been the intensification of financial turmoil in Europe.  (See the box “Developments in 
Ireland and the Euro-A rea Periphery”  and t he “Financial Development s” section.)  At 
present, it is too soon to tell how these renewed stresses will be resolved and how they 
will affect global economic performance.  Our current judgment is that economic activity 
in the peripheral euro- area countries will indeed be restrained by less favorable financing 
conditions, ongoing banking sector vulnerabilities, and aggressive fiscal consolidations.  However, absent  further deterioration in the European banking system or sovereign 
funding conditions, the spillovers from the ongoing stresses will likely be limited.  Accordingly, and as recent indicators have generally been in line with our expectations, 
our overall forecast for foreign economic activity is little changed from the October Tealbook.  That said, the risk  of adverse tail events has  clearly risen , and we explore the 
effects on U.S. growth of a further intensification of financial pressures in Europe in the “Risks and Uncertainties ” section . 
After slowing considerably in the third quarter, aggregate foreign GDP growth is 
estimated to have picked up to 2¾ percent in the current quarter .  This pattern has been 
shaped largely  by the emerging market economies  (EMEs) , many of which decelerated  in 
the third quarter following outsized first- half gains  but ha ve again picked up the pace.  In 
the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), activity  has also slowed  from earlier in the year , 
but we do not expect much improvement in growth in the near term as fiscal consolidation and saving to rebuild financial positions restrain spending .  Over time, as 
private domestic demand gains momentum, we predict overall f oreign growth to 
strengthen to  about 3½ percent in  2012. 
A recent acceleration of food and energy prices ha s led us to raise our estimate  of 
foreign headline inflation in the current quarter to nearly 4  percent  at an annual rate, up 
about 1½ percent age points from the October Tealbook.  C ore inflation , however, has 
been relatively steady  across the foreign economies.  As we expect the recent rise in food 
and energy price inflation to be transitory, our projection calls for headline inflation to 
subside to about 2¼ percent by the end of next year.  Inflation should remain at about that 
level in 2012 as  continued resource slack in the advanced economies helps to keep price

 Developments  in Ireland and th e Euro‐Area Periphery 
Financial tensions  in Ireland escalated  over the  past two months.  As 
shown in  the left‐hand figure, interest rate spreads on Irish  10‐year 
sovereign  bonds over German bunds  widened  from an already  elevated  
4 percentage points  in mid‐ October to around  6 percentage  points by 
early November.  Two  developments  contributed  to th e heightened  
tensions:   (1) discussion  of a German proposal  to eventually  force the 
restructuring  of private holdings  of sovereign  debt and (2) increased  
concerns  over Irish  banks’  growing real estate  loan losses  and their 
associated  funding difficulties.  Afflicted  in part by deposit flight, Irish 
banks have become increasingly  dependent  on funding from the 
European  Central Bank  (ECB). 
With access  to market  funding increasingly  limited and corporate bank  
deposits falling sharply, the Irish  government  entered into discussions  
with European  Union (EU) authorities  and the International  Monetary  
Fund (IMF), eventually  agreeing  on a rescue package totaling €85  billion, 
of which €22.5 billion is from the IMF and €45 billion  is from a 
combination  of EU resources  and bilateral loans by individual  EU 
countries.  In  addition, the Irish government  will contribute  €17.5 billion 
from its pension fund  and cash reserves,  to be used to support Irish  
banks.  The  loan package  is expected  to be sufficient to keep  the Irish 
government  from needing market funding for two years  and to stabilize 
the Irish banking sector and provide it with a capital  injection of  
€10 billion (rising to as much as €35 billion, if needed).   For its part, Ireland 
has agreed to implement a fiscal  consolidation  of €15 billion (9 percent of 
GDP) over th e next four years, two‐thirds of  which will be spending  cuts, 
on top of the austerity measures  already adopted  in the past two years.   
The Irish government  intends to maintain  its guarantee  on senior bank 
debt; that  guarantee  was the main cause of the sharp run‐up in Irish 
government  debt over the  past three years.   
The Irish rescue package does  not seem to have calm ed markets, and  the 
focus has turned to the possibility  that official assistance  would also be 
required for other  peripheral  euro‐area countries  with  high fiscal deficits 
and debts.  The right ‐hand figure shows the peripheral  countries  that are 
most vulnerable  in those dimensions.   Aside from Greece and Ireland, 
market pressures  have been most  acute for Portugal,  where slow 
economic  growth and significant  structural  and competitiveness  
problems  threaten to  make its government  debt unsustainable.   
Investors  also showed increasing  concern about Spain because of  its 
large fiscal deficit and problems  at its banks—both  owing to its housing 
boom and bust.  The debt  level in Spain is relatively  low, but it  could have 
trouble financing  itself at elevated  interest rates.   In addition,  Spain is

 much larger than  the other peripheral  economies, and  investors  are 
concerned  that its potential  financing  needs are too large to be covered 
by existing mechanisms.   Finally, concerns  have also emerged  that the 
crisis could spread even  beyond Spain to other high‐debt euro‐area 
countries  such as Italy and Belgium. 
Partly in  response  to th ese developments,  the ECB announced  following  
its December  2 policy meeting that it would delay exit from its 
nonstandard  liquidity measures.   Although the  ECB did not make any 
statement  about the future of its program  to buy the debt of vulnerable  
euro‐area countries, market  participants  reported  an increased  intensity  
of ECB purchases  of such debt  following  the meeting,  leading to a sharp  
decline in sovereign  spreads for Ireland  and Portugal.

  pressures contained .  Relative to the October Tealbook, our forecast of inflation in the 
second half of 2011 and in 2012 is little changed. 
We continue to expect the AFEs  to maintain highly accommodative monetary 
policies  throughout the forecast period , with the recent flare -up of financial tensions in 
the euro area delaying the E uropean C entral Bank’s (ECB)  windup of its special liquidity 
provisions.  In the EMEs, we assume further policy tightening, although heightened 
concerns over capital flows and exchange rate pressures have added to the uncertainty about future monetary policy responses. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
We continue to forecast an anemic recovery in the AFEs, where growth has 
slowed from 3½ percent at an annual rate in the first half of this year to an estimated 
1¾ percent in the second half.  This step-down in growth is slightly larger than was anticipated in October, reflecting some softness in third-quarter GDP for Canada and the euro area.  We expect AFE economic growth to remain arou nd 2 percent through 2011, 
held down by increasing fiscal consolidation and continuing balance sheet repair.  In 2012, growth picks up to 2½ percent as balance sheet positions improve and private 
spending strengthens. 
Intensified  concerns over fiscal sustainability and banking sector vulnerabilities 
have weighed on our growth outlook for the euro area, but greater momentum in the German economy and the positive effects of the euro ’s recent  depreciation  have gone the 
other way, leaving our forecast down only a little.  Our working assumption is that 
Portugal will follow Greece and Ireland in requiring a financial assistance package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, but that other countries will avoid such serious financial pressures .  In order to reassure markets that sufficient 
resources exi st to backstop Spain and other vulnerable countries, we assume that 
European authorities will at some point increase the funds available for official assistance.  We also assume that authorities will take measures to shore up confidence in 
the banking sector, including additional stress tests and continued liquidity provision and 
sovereign bond purchases by the ECB.  Even with these actions, however, the possibility of a more serious disruption to sovereign and bank financing in peripheral Europe and beyond poses a heightened risk to our outlook.

  Euro Area 
Real GDP growth for the euro area moved down from 4 percent in the second 
quarter to 1½ percent in the third quarter, just a little below our  expectations .  Economic 
performance within the euro area continued to diverge.  T hird-quarter German growth  
was nearly twice the euro -area average, and recent indicators show continued solid 
performance:  German retail sales surged in October , consumer confi dence and 
purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) shot up in November, and the German IFO index of 
business sentiment posted a record high.  In contrast, Spanish activity stagnated in the third quarter, and Greek GDP declined nearly 4½ percent. 
The recent renewal of financial stresses should weigh on euro -area growth going 
forward, but these effects  should be mitigated by the stimulus to net exports stemming 
from the depreciation of the euro over the past month.  In light of the weaker euro and the relatively st rong incoming data, we now expect less slowing of growth in Germany.  
Nonethe less, given the sharper slowing we now project for the rest of the euro area, our 
forecast for overall euro -area activity is a little weaker than that in the October Tealbook, 
with GDP growth declining to about 1 percent in 2011 and picking up to 2¼ percent in 
2012.  Indeed, the deteriorating outlook for growth in the peripheral euro- area economies 
has heightened uncertainty regarding their ability to reduce their fiscal deficits, and this poses the risk of further financial instability.  
Euro -area headline inflation has exceeded  our expectations, rising to nearly 
2 percent on a 12- month basis in November .  This partly reflects  a rise in  energy prices , 
but core inflation edged up as well —to just above 1 percent —and we expect it to be 
supported in the near term by further increases in indirect taxes and administered prices embedded in fiscal consolidation plans.  Thereafter, headline inflation should ease to around 1½ percent.   We cont inue to assume that the ECB will not raise its benchmark 
policy rate, currently at 1 percent, until the second half of 2012.  Before then, we expect the ECB to gradually exit from its unconventional liquidity policies, though the increase 
in financial tens ions has delayed that exit.  
Japan 
Real GDP rose a better -than-expected 3.9 percent in the third quarter, as 
purchases of fuel -efficient cars surged before the expiration of a subsidy program in early 
September.  Payback from this program should lead to a noticeable drop in private

  consumption in the current quarter, contributing to a projected contraction in real GDP of 
1½ percent.  Smoothing through these quarterly swings, our outlook for GDP growth is 
about unchanged for the second half of the year and beyond relative to the October 
Tealbook.  W e continue to anticipate that real GDP will expand  1½ percent in 2011 and 
2 percent in 2012. 
In October, 12- month inflation turned positive for the first time since December 
2008.  However, this development was due in part to a one- time hike in tobacco taxes , 
and we continue to project deflation to persist over the next two years.  Accordingly, we 
have also maintained our assumption that the Bank of Japan will moderately step up its asset purchases.  
Canada 
Real GDP r ose a disappointing 1 percent in the third quarter, as domestic demand 
accelerated  but net exports subtracted from growth.  Consumption and fixed investment 
expanded robustly, and imports of capital goods rose almost 30 percent at an annual rate.  
We estimate that GDP increased 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter, with a rebound in 
exports and a slowing of imports reducing the drag from the external sector .  Domestic 
demand should remain solid , keeping GDP growth around 2½ percent over the forecast 
period.  We  expect Canadian headline inflation on a four- quarter  basis to rise from 
around 1½ percent in the current quarter  to a touch above the Bank of Canada’s 2 percent 
target by the middle of next year as economic slack diminishes.  After tightening over the 
first three quarters of the year, the Bank of Canada is assumed to keep monetary policy on hold through the end of 2011 before raising rates further  to keep inflation near its 
target . 
United Kingdom 
We estimate that GDP growth has slowed from 3 percent in the third quarter to 
2 percent in the fourth as fiscal retrenchment begins  to bite and the cyclical impetus from 
the inventory swing wanes.  We see GDP growth edg ing up to 2½ percent by 2012 as 
fading financial stresses help revive private demand and as a low  sterling stimulates 
exports.  Downside risks have increased because of  heightened financial instability in 
peripheral euro -area economies , particularly given the United Kingdom’s vulnerable 
fiscal position and strong ties to Ireland.  Nonetheless, expectations of further asset purchases by the Bank of England (BOE) have declined following the publication of the 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
December 8, 2010
Page 42 of 100
   
  BOE’s  quarterly forecast, which showed a more optimistic outlook for growth than had 
been expected , and amid incoming data showing resilient inflation.  The 12-month 
change in consumer prices ticked up to 3.2 percent in October, pushed up by rising 
gasoline prices, and should remain above the BOE’s 2 percent target until early 2012.  
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
Recent data releases confirm that growth in the EME s slowed sharply from the 
rapid pace earlier this year.  We now estimate that third -quarter growth was 2½ percent , 
down from 8¼ percent in the second quarter .  This steep decline is in large part an artifact 
of highly volatile data for Mexico and Singapore.  But EME growth slowed more generally as well, owing to the maturation of the inventory cycle  and associated rebound 
in trade, the unwinding of fiscal stimulus measures, and a continued tightening of moneta ry policies in several  countries.  In the current quarter, EME g rowth is estimated 
at 4 percent, up about ½ percentage point from the October Tealbook , as greater -than-
expected strength in China and Mexico more than offset somewhat weaker growth elsewhere.  As the United States and other advanced economies pick up steam, real GDP growth in the EMEs should rise to around 5 percent in 2012, little changed from the previous Tealbook. 
Consumer prices in the EMEs have recently accelerated, led by rising food prices.  
The food price increases stem fro m both country- specific conditions as well as recent  
increases in the global prices of food commodities such as wheat , corn , and soybeans.  
We view the sharp rise in food inflation as transitory  and expect  that EME headline 
inflation , after peaking at arou nd 5 percent at an annual rate in the current quarter , will 
fall to about 3¼ percent over the forecast period. 
China  
Recent indicators  point to continued economic strength following real GDP 
growth of 9¾ percent in the third quarter.  Industrial production grew robustly in 
October, and the PMI rose to 55 in November.  Domestic demand in October appeared 
firm, with fixed -asset investment and nominal retail sales remaining more than 20 percent 
above their year- earlier levels.  
Inflation over the 12 month s ending in October rose to 4½ percent, almost entirely 
reflecting higher food prices.  In response, the authorities have released reserves of grain

  and other foods, and have raised the possibility of imposing price controls.  Additionally, 
the People’s Bank of China raised the reserve requirement ratio  twice in November  for a  
cumulative increase of 1 percentage point.  Global financial markets reacted negatively to 
the moves , fearing that authorities will tighten excessively and squelch growth.  Although 
we view  this development as a potential downside risk, we continue to expect that 
Chinese authorities will be successful in adjusting policy to achieve GDP growth in the neighborhood of 8 to 9 percent going forward . 
Other Emerging Asia  
Economic activity  in the re st of emerging Asia contracted in the third quarter .  
While most of this decline reflected a steep drop in Singapore’s volatile output, real GDP 
also declined in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.  We believe that many of the 
emerging Asian economies are following, with a lag, a business cycle similar to that of China, where growth slowed in the second quarter but showed vigor in the third.  The 
most recent PMI releases provide some evidence that these other Asian economies are indeed turning a corner; the November PMIs for both Korea and Taiwan swung above 50 after being in the contraction range in the previous few months. 
India, Korea, and Thailand recently raised their policy rates  to help fight inflation, 
which has risen across emerging  Asia.  Alth ough, as discussed below, some data point to 
a slowing of capital flows to EMEs, such  flows  remain an important concern in  many 
countries.  We now assume that, t o better manage both inflation and capital inflows, 
some of the emerging Asian economies will allow their currencies to appreciate a bit more than in the previous Tealbook. 
Latin America  
Real GDP growth in Latin America slowed to 3 percent in the third quarter, and 
we estimate that growth  remained around that pace in  the current quarter.  By 2012, L atin 
American growth is expected to move up to around 3¾ percent.   The contour of the Latin 
American forecast is driven largely by Mexico, where GDP looks to be expanding at a 3¼ percent pace in the current quarter .  This estimate is about 1¾ percentage po ints 
higher than  in the October Tealbook, reflecting more favorable indicators of domestic 
demand as well as a stronger estimate of  U.S. manufacturing production, which is highly 
correlated with Mexican output.  We project Mexican GDP growth to rise to nea rly 
4 percent in 2012, owing in large part to improvement in the U.S. economy.

  For Brazil, we raised our forecast  for growth to about 4 percent in the current 
quarter  and the next , owing in part to our assessment that  expansionary fiscal policies  
will remain in place a bit longer  than previously anticipated .  With stronger near- term 
activity and inflation picking up to 5½ percent in the 12 months through November, we 
now assume a somewhat faster pace of monetary policy tightening.  Accordingly, w e 
have mark ed down our projection for GDP growth a bit over the remainder of the 
forecast period  to an average of 3¾ percent. 
CAPITAL FLOWS TO EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
In recent months, authorities in many EMEs have expressed concerns about 
mounting capital inflows and the attendant pressures on their exchange rates and asset prices.  This section reviews developments in private capital flows to EMEs since the financial crisis.  As background, we note that several fundamental factors currently 
support such flows: 
• a continuing return of investors to  EMEs after the large outflows experienced 
during the crisis;  
 
• more -favorable growth prospects in the EMEs than in the advanced 
economies, reflecting both the two-speed nature of the global economic recovery as well as long -standing differences in growth potential; and 
 
• the divergent monetary policy stances of the tw o groups. 
 
With respect to monetary policy, the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program in 
particular has been criticized for lowering U.S. long- term interest r ates and thus 
encouraging investors to purchase riskier assets in the EMEs. 
Indeed, net private capital flows to Latin American and Asian EMEs as a share of 
their aggregate GDP, the most comprehensive but least timely data available, were quite elevated in  the second half of 2009 relative to their pre- crisis average (the blue bars in 
top-left panel).

1 For the purposes of this section, t he EMEs comprise Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, 
Hong Kong, India, Indone sia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, 
and Venezuela.    In part, these strong inflows reflect a recovery following the large 
outflows during the crisis.  P rivate capital inflows slowed in the first half of 2010 but 
remained sizable .  Combined with significant current account surpluses (the orange bars), 
these inflows have placed upward pressure on EME currencies.

  Because EME officials, to varying degrees, have resisted currency appreciation 
through purchases of dollars and other foreign exchange, changes in EME reserve assets 
may provide some indication of the intensity of recent capi tal flows.  As shown in the 
figure for official reserve holdings at the F ederal Reserve Bank of New York, these 
holdings increased ste adily from mid -September to early November, which we see as the 
counterpart to strong net private  capital flows in to EMEs.  In recent weeks , however, 
these holdings have leveled out, suggesting diminished inflows to the EMEs, perhaps 
reflecting increased i nvestor risk aversion amid renewed financial stresses in the euro 
area.  This pattern of strong private capital inflows in September and October followed 
by moderation in November is also apparent in data on net inflows to emerging market equity and bond funds (the middle panels). 
Data for p rivate  capital flows from the United States to the EMEs , which provide 
a window into global flows and are more timely and detailed, exhibit a pattern similar to that of total private flows to these economies .  Starting w ith banking flows, net claims of 
U.S.-resident banks on Asian and Latin American EMEs declined sharply in the second 
half of 2008 and have since rebounded only to their pre-c risis level (red line in bottom-
left panel).  A great deal of U.S. banking flows to the EMEs are channeled through the United Kingdom and the Caribbean banking centers, but the level of U.S. net claims on 
these entities, while rising briskly of late, remains below prior highs (the blue line).
2  
All 
told, net lending of U.S. banks to EMEs through October does not appear out of line with historical trends.  Unlike the bank flows to EMEs, U.S. purchases of EME securities picked up noticeably in September and October (red line in bottom-right panel).  However, they were  not outsized relative to U.S. purchases of securities issued by Europe 
or “other” countries (which include s Canada).  
                                                 
2 BIS data through the first half of 2010 indicate that claims of the financial centers on EMEs have 
followed the same pattern.

December 8, 2010
Page 47 of 100All together, the various data sources suggest that the rebound in private capital 
flows to EMEs, which began in early 2009, has sufficed only to return the level of net claims on these countries, broadly speaking, to its  long-term trend.  Furthermore, recent 
flows from the United States to the EMEs do not appear unusually large relative to the 
U.S. flows to other countries.  These findings support the view that accommodative U.S. 
monetary policy may have played a smaller role in driving capital flows  to EMEs  than 
some observers have suggested.

Financial Developments 
Changes in financial conditions were mixe d over the intermeeting period.  Interest 
rates at both short a nd longer maturities rose substantia lly, on net, reflecting an apparent 
reassessment by investors of the likely ultimate size of the Federal Reserve’s asset 
purchase program, economic data that were s een by market participants as suggesting a 
somewhat improved economic outlook, and the tentative agreement between the 
Administration and the Congress regarding a package of fiscal measures.  Renewed 
concerns about fiscal strain s and banking-sector problems in the euro-area periphery 
contributed to increased volatili ty in financial markets but did not appear to prompt a 
widespread pullback from risky assets.  Si nce the November FOMC meeting, broad stock 
price indexes have risen moderately, wh ile risk spreads on corporate bonds are 
unchanged or down slightly on balance.  TIPS- based measures of inflation compensation 
increased at the 5-year maturity but only edged up 5 to 10 years ahead.  Short-term 
funding markets showed some signs of modest strai n, but funding conditions for 
domestic institutions were generally stable.  The dollar appreciated against most other currencies, mainly on the concerns about fi scal pressures in Europe and the revised 
outlook for monetary polic y in the United States. 
 Overall borrowing by nonfinancial corporations was robust again in November, 
and indicators of credit quality continued to improve.  Meanwhile, financing conditions 
for commercial real estate remain tight, and the performance of commercial mortgage debt deteriorated further.  For househ olds, the issues surrounding foreclosure 
improprieties appear to have had little, if  any, negative effect on mortgage financing 
activity, but mortgage debt ha s stayed on a downward trend amid delinquency and default 
rates that remain elevated.  In contrast, consumer credit outstanding appears to be 
stabilizing after two years of runoffs, and the credit quality of consumer debt has continued to improve.    
Core loans at commercial banks contracted again in October and November, 
though at a somewhat slower pace than in the third quarter.  Bank profitability was little 
changed last quarter, as reductions in loan loss provisions were about offset by higher 
noninterest expenses.  M2 expanded moderately in November, as strong growth in liquid 
deposits and currency continued to more than offset declines in small time deposits and 
retail money market mutual funds.  Responses to the December 2010 Senior Credit

TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS  
The November FOMC statement elicited limited immediate price action in most 
asset classes, suggesting that the out come had largely been anticipated. 1  However, yields 
on 30-year Treasury bonds moved up sharpl y in response to the Desk announcement, 
which indicated that the dist ribution of purchases would be more heavily weighted 
toward short- and intermediate-term securi ties than some market participants had 
expected.  Over the weeks following the Nove mber meeting, yields on nominal Treasury 
securities increased, as investors reportedly  revised down their estimates of the ultimate 
size of the FOMC’s new Treasury purchase program.  Late in the intermeeting period, 
yields ratcheted higher on news of the tentative agreement between the Administration 
and the Congress regarding a package of fiscal  measures that incl ude the extension of 
current tax rates and unempl oyment benefits, as well as  additional tax cuts.   
All told, yields on 2-year nominal Treasur y securities rose about 25 basis points 
over the intermeeting period, and 5- and 10-y ear yields were both up about 55 basis 
points.  Market-based measures of uncertain ty about longer-term yi elds also picked up 
notably, apparently contributing to an increase  in term premiums.  Indeed, staff models 
suggest that higher term premiums account for a large fraction of the rise in the 10-year 
yield.  Market participants i ndicated that the backup in ra tes was amplified by decisions 
of leveraged investors to unwind long Treasur y positions put in place before the last 
FOMC meeting; anecdotal repo rts suggest that convexity hedging flows also may have 
contributed to the rise in rates.  The spr ead between the 30- and 10-year Treasury yields 
peaked at its highest level in more than 30 years early in the period and then fell back, 
evidently reflecting changing views about th e Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program 
(see the box “Long-Term Treasury Yields”). 
                                                 
1 The Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank  of New York purchased about $107 billion of 
Treasury securities over the period, reflecting both pu rchases under the new asset purchase program and 
reinvestment of principal payments on Federal Reserve holdings of agency MBS and agency debt.  The 
effective federal funds rate averaged 19 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the intraday 
standard deviation averaging about 3 basis points.

 Long‐Term  Treasury  Yields 
In the few months  leading up to the November  FOMC meeting the spread between  
30‐ and 10‐year nominal Treasury  yields increased  notably, on net, reaching  its highest 
level in more than 30 years in the week following  the November  FOMC announcement,  as 
shown in  the figure below.  Since November  10, however,  the spread has declined  
considerably,  largely reflecting  a sizable backup  in 10‐year yields.  The  large swings in this 
spread appear to have reflected importantly  the effects of changes in investors’  
expectations  regarding  the Federal Reserve’s  purchases  of Treasury  securities  and long‐
term inflation.    
The table on the next page provides som e perspective  on the recent changes in the 
spread between 30‐  and 10‐year nominal  Treasury  yields by decomposing  the changes in 
yields from  September  20 to December  7 into changes in 1‐year forward rates  across the  
curve over three sub ‐periods.  From September  20 to November  10 (columns  5 and 6), 
nominal 1‐year forward rates  in the 2‐ to 7‐year sector  dropped significantly,  while those 
at longer  horizons  recorded  sharp increases.   This pattern of  changes in forward rates  
seems consistent  with anecdotal  reports suggesting  that investors  had become 
increasingly  confident  that the Federal Reserve  would conduct additional  Treasur y 
purchases  in the 2‐ to 10‐year  sector.  The  increase in  forward rates  at horizons  between 
10 and 30 years was reinforced  by the November  FOMC statement  and by the 
accompanying  statement  from the Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve  Bank of New 
York that pointed to a smaller‐than‐expe cted allocation  of new Treasury  purchases  to 
securities  with maturities  greater than 10 years.1  
 
 
 
  
 
  
                                                 
1 Before the November  FOMC meeting,  some market commentaries  indicated  that the share of 
total asset  purchases  in the 10‐ to 30‐year sector was expected  to be about 15 percent.  In contrast,  on 
November  3, simultaneous  with the release  of the FOMC statement,  the Trading Desk at the Federal 
Reserve Bank  of New York  announced  that the 10‐ to 30‐year sec tor would receive only a 6 percent 
allocation  of the total intended  purchases.

In response  to those statements,  the 30‐year nominal  Treasury  yield increased  14 basis 
points while the 10‐year yield  was about unchanged.   The shift in investor sentiment  away 
from the 30‐year bond  seemed to carry over to the auction  of that security conducted  on 
November  10, which was not very well received.   On net, as shown in column 6 in the 
table above, forward rates  at horizons  of 15 to 20 years increased  80 to 90 basis  points 
during the period from the day before the November  FOMC meeting to November  10. 
However, since November 10 (column   7), 1‐year forward rates  in the 2‐ to 7‐year  range 
have risen sharply, apparently  as investors  have reassessed the  ultimate scale of 
additional  Federal Reserve purchases  of Treasury  securities  and reacted to the potential  
bipartisan  agreement  on tax cuts announced  on the evening of December  6.  At the same 
time, forward rates  further out the term structure have declined  substantially,  except in 
the 25‐ to 30‐year sector, where  rates more than retraced  their declines on December  7.     
Changes 
in the outlook  for inflation at 
different horizons  also appear to have 
contributed  to the recent  behavior of the 
spread between 30‐  and 10‐year yields.  As

  The rise in nominal Treasury yields was accompanied by sizable increases in real 
yields, with 5- and 10-year  TIPS yields up about 35 basi s points and 50 basis points, 
respectively.  TIPS-based in flation compensation moved up about 20 basis points at the 
5-year horizon, amid rising energy prices, bu t only edged higher 5 to 10 years ahead.  
Swaps-based measures of inflation compensa tion moved about in line with their TIPS 
counterparts.  On net for the period, survey -based measures of short-term inflation 
expectations also rose slightly, while longe r-term survey expectations were unchanged. 
Based on the staff’s standard term prem ium  adjustment, futures quotes indicate 
that the path for the federal f unds rate currently expected by ma rket participants starts to 
increase around the beginning of 2012 and rise s to about 85 basis points by the end of 
that year, a 45 basis point increase since the time of the November FOMC meeting.  
Quotes on interest rate caps suggest that the modal path of the federal funds rate also 
moved up over the intermeeting period and now ri ses above the current target range at the 
end of 2012, three quarters earli er than at the time of the November meeting.  However, 
staff analysis indicates that term premiums at the short e nd of the curve increased over 
the intermeeting period, consistent with high er near-term uncertain ty about monetary 
policy.  As a result, the revision in the anticipated policy path may be smaller than that 
implied by our usual measures of policy expectations. 
Results from the latest survey of pr imary dealers provide some additional 
evidence of an increase in term premiums, as respondents indicated that the expected path 
of the federal funds rate was little changed since the October survey.2  Median 
expectations for the total size of the asset purchase program declined somewhat and stood 
at $850 billion, compared with $1 tr illion in the earlier survey.  Market participants also 
marked up slightly their outlook for near-term economic growth. 
ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad stock price indexes in creased about 3 percent, on net, over the intermeeting 
period.  Equity prices rose sharply follo wing the FOMC policy announcement, but these 
gains were more than reversed over the s ubsequent two weeks amid renewed concerns 
about the strength of the globa l economy—prompted by the fiscal  situation in Europe and 
the announcement of policy tightening by China—and criticism of the announced 
                                                 
2 Note that the survey was completed before the December 7 rise in money market yields associated 
with the news about a tentative agreement on the fiscal package.  Anecdotal reports suggest that dealers 
revised their views about monetary policy and the ec onomic outlook in the wake  of that agreement.

  expansion of the FOMC’s asset purchase pr ogram.  However, more recently, equity 
prices have strengthened on incoming economic data that were re ad by investors as 
suggesting that the recovery could be gaining traction, at least outside the housing sector.  
Stock prices for domestic commercial banks  have been volatile since the November 
FOMC meeting but, on net, have outperformed  broad indexes.  Option-implied volatility 
on the S&P 500 index fell modestly over the pe riod, and the spread between the staff’s 
estimate of the expected real  return on equity for S&P 500 firms and the real 10-year 
Treasury yield—a rough measure of the equity  risk premium—narrowe d a bit, although it 
remained elevated relati ve to longer-run norms. 
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose about in line with those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities, l eaving their spreads about flat; spreads on 
speculative-grade bonds moved down somewhat.  Secondary-market prices for leveraged 
loans rose slightly over the intermeeting pe riod, while bid-asked spreads in that market 
continued to drift down.   
Some signs of modest stress emerged in  certain short-term funding markets over 
the intermeeting period as investors focuse d increasingly on the e volving situation in 
Europe, where some further credit tiering has reportedly occurred.  The spread of the 
three-month forward rate agreement over the three-month forward overnight index swap 
(OIS) rate moved somewhat higher, perhaps poi nting to heightened concerns about future 
funding conditions.  In the commercial paper (CP) market, spreads on paper issued by 
financial institutions with parents in Europe  increased, and spreads on asset-backed CP 
were somewhat volatile, particularly for conduits sponsored by nonbank institutions.  Nonetheless, spreads on A2/P2-rated nonfinancial CP remained at low levels.  In addition, spreads of one- and three-month dol lar Libor over OIS rates continued to be 
low, interest rates and haircuts on repurc hase agreements were little changed across 
collateral types, and there have  been no indications of widesp read funding pressures over 
year-end.   
In the December 2010 SCOOS, dealers report ed an easing of credit terms over the 
past three months with respect to securities financing transactions and with respect to a 
range of counterparties, including hedge f unds and other private pools of capital, 
insurance companies and other institutional i nvestors, and nonfinancial firms.  More 
aggressive competition from other institutions and an improvement in the current or expected financial strength of counterpart ies were frequently cited reasons for the

  loosening of terms.  Dealers also noted that  demand for funding of all types of securities 
had increased over the past three months.   
Recent conversations with market partic ipants ind icated that many leveraged 
investors reportedly reduced their risk posit ions after the announcement of additional 
asset purchases by the FOMC at the November meeting, a tre nd that continued during the 
month as a consequence of press accounts of  investigations centered around possible 
insider trading by hedge funds and their advisors and a rise in uncertainty concerning the 
European situation.  Lately, however, there ha ve been some indications that leveraged 
investors have reestablished risk  positions in certain markets,  such as the equity market. 
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Net debt financing of nonfinancial cor porations continued to be robust in 
November.   Gross issuance of corporate bonds was extraordinarily heavy, particularly 
for speculative-grade firms.  Over recent months, investor demand for syndicated leveraged loans also appears to have remained  high, as reflected in a significan t volume 
of deals moving through the pipeline and in a trend toward greater leverage embedded in 
these deals, albeit from a relatively low ba se.  Commercial and i ndustrial (C&I) loans on 
banks’ books expanded modestly, on balance, in  October and November after running off 
again in the third quarter.  Nonfinancial CP outstanding declined notably during October 
and November, in part as some nonfinancial firms reportedly shifted to bond financing.   
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinanci al firms through seasoned and initial 
public offerings (IPOs) was particularly strong in November, boosted by GM’s well-
received IPO as well as a number of secondary  issues.  In the th ird quarter, equity 
retirements increased, as both share repur chases and cash-financed mergers and 
acquisitions picked up.  As a result, net equi ty issuance by nonfinancial corporations is 
estimated to have dipped deeper into negative territory in that peri od.  Announcements of 
mergers and new share repurchase programs sugg est a further increase in the pace of 
equity retirements in the fourth quarter. 
According to the BEA’s preliminary estimat e, U.S. corporate profits rose about 
3 percent in the third quarter (not at an annual rate), clos e to the increase seen in the 
second quarter.  In the third quarter, operati ng earnings per share for S&P 500 firms also 
rose about 3 percent and were more than 30 percent above their year-earlier levels.  The

  mid-November reading showed th at analysts revised up slightly  their expectations for the 
year-ahead earnings of S&P 500 firms. 
The credit quality of nonfinancial corpor ations has continued to im prove.  The 
aggregate ratio of debt to assets for such firms declined a bit further in the third quarter, 
and the aggregate liquid asset ratio rose again, reaching its highest level in more than 
20 years.  Upgrades by Moody’s Investors Service of nonfinancial corporate bonds 
outnumbered downgrades again in both Octobe r and November.  The six-month trailing 
bond default rate for nonfinancial firms remained near historical lows in October, and the 
KMV expected year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms, while still somewhat 
elevated, moved a bit lower in November. 
Financing conditions for commercial real  estate remained tight.  Commercial 
mortgage debt is estimated to have declined at an annual rate of about 8 percent in the 
third quarter, and the delinquency rates for securitized commercial mortgages and those 
for existing properties held at commercial ba nks increased further.  Meanwhile, the share 
of commercial properties sold  at a nominal loss moved highe r in October.  However, 
there continued to be some modest signs of improvement.  According to the CoStar repeat-sales index, prices of  commercial real estate ch anged little, on balance, over 
September and October and have held in a re latively narrow range since the spring, after 
having dropped sharply over the preceding tw o years.  Also, issuance of commercial 
mortgage-backed securities increased in Novemb er and is likely to reach $10 billion in 
2010, up from $1.3 billion in 2009 but still far below pre-crisis levels. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Mortgage rates rose considerably ove r the intermeeting period, though not by 
quite as much as rates on longer-term Treas ury securities.  Accord ing to weekly data 
from Freddie Mac, the average interest rate  on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages 
climbed to 4½ percent by the end of Novemb er.  More recent daily  data indicate that 
mortgage rates have increased further since then, bringing the rise over the intermeeting 
period as a whole to nearly ½ percentage point.  Re financing activity declined in response 
to the higher mortgage rates, likely easing th e pressures at mortgage lenders seen earlier 
this year.  As a result, the spread between mortgage rate s and MBS yields dropped back, 
reversing the spread widening that had o ccurred over the preceding several months.

  According to the repeat-sales index from  CoreLogic, house prices fell in October 
for the fifth consecutive month, leaving the index down about 6 percent since May.  The 
house price declines this  summer and fall have more than retraced the incr eases seen in 
2009 and the first half of 2010.  The house pr ice indexes from the Federal Housing 
Finance Agency and S&P/Case-Shiller also declined in September, albeit at more 
subdued paces.  House prices continue to be weighed down by the large inventory of 
unsold homes, tight mortgage credit, and sl uggish demand for housing.  In addition, the 
drop in house prices since the spring likely has been amplified by an in crease in the share 
of sales involving distressed properties. 
Outstanding residential mortgage debt is es tim ated to have contracted at an annual 
rate of roughly 3 percent in th e third quarter, about the average rate of decline seen over 
the preceding year.  To date, the issues surrounding the repo rted foreclosure improprieties 
by some financial institutions appear to have had little effect on house prices and 
mortgage financing activity.  The serious delinquency rate on prime mortgages ticked down in October but remained extremely elev ated; delinquencies on subprime mortgages, 
available through September, have declined a bit from their peak but also remain 
exceptionally high.   
In contrast, the consumer credit mark et has exhibited continued signs of 
stabilization.  Although consumer credit contra cted in the third qua rter, the decline was 
the smallest since late 2008, and nonrevolving credit expanded modestly; in October, top-
line consumer credit edged higher.  The p ace of consumer ABS issuance in November 
was a shade above the average for the year to date, mostly due to $6 billion of auto ABS 
issuance.  The delinquency rate on consumer loans at banks continued to decline in the third quarter, as did delinquency rates on auto and credit card loans held outside the 
banking sector.  Overall, the improvement in credit quality for consumer loans has been 
substantially greater than that  for mortgage debt.  In this  environment, the number of 
credit card offers mailed to households has moved up considerably over the course of the 
year. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Over the intermeeting period, international financial mark ets reacted primarily to 
renewed concerns about fiscal a nd financial strains in the euro  area, shifts in views about 
U.S. monetary policy, and fears that policy tightening by Chinese authorities may slow 
global growth.  Against this backdrop, th e dollar appreciated broadly, sovereign bond

  yields rose, and equity markets were mi xed in both advanced and emerging market 
economies. 
After depreciating immediately following the FOMC’s November 3 
announcem
ent of further asset purchases, the do llar appreciated over the remainder of the 
intermeeting period.  Intensifyi ng concerns about stresses in  the euro area were an 
important factor behind this reversal, but i nvestor reassessment of the monetary policy 
outlook in the United States also played a role .  On net, the broad dollar index rose about 
1½ percent over the period, with  the dollar up almost 5¼ perc ent against the euro.  The 
announcement of an €85 billion financial ai d package for Ireland on November 28 did 
little to stem the depr eciation of the euro.  (See the box “Developments in Ireland and the 
Euro-Area Periphery” in the In ternational Economic Developments and Outlook section.)  
Indeed, the pace of dollar appreciation pick ed up as investors grew increasingly 
concerned about market pressures potentially spreading to other euro-area countries and 
the adequacy of resources available to s upport stressed European economies.  Spreads 
over German bunds of sovereign yields in so me peripheral euro-area countries rose to 
new highs, although they have fallen back in  the past week amid reports that the 
European Central Bank (ECB) has increased  its purchases of Irish and Portuguese 
sovereign debt.  Financial pressures on some countries in emerging Europe also 
increased, in particular for Hungary, whic h saw its credit rating downgraded by Moody’s 
late in the period. 
Banks in the euro-area periphery continued to rely heavily on the weekly and 
longer-term funding operations  of the ECB, and overnight borrowing from the ECB 
increased over the period despite the penalty rate charged.  In addi tion, there were some 
signs of increased dollar funding pressures for European ba nks, with the implied basis 
spread from euro-dollar swaps rising about 15 basis points, on net, although there was no 
increase in the demand for dollar liquidity in the ECB’s regular dollar tender operations.   
Concerns about the euro-ar ea periphery prompted a shift down in implied future 
short-term interest rates in the euro area, as market participants scaled back somewhat the 
pace at which they expect the ECB to norma lize policy.  Reinforcing those expectations, 
the ECB announced on December 2 that it will continue to conduct refinancing 
operations with terms of up to three months as fixed-rate, full-allotment tenders through 
at least the first quarter of  2011.  Although European concerns  sparked flight-to-safety 
flows into benchmark sovereign bonds late in  the period, 10-year sovereign yields still

  increased 25 to 45 basis points, on net, in the advanced foreign economies.  The 
reassessment of the monetary policy outlook in the United Stat es and the related rise in 
U.S. yields may have contributed to the rise in foreign yi elds, but there was also some 
reduction of the perceived likelihood of further quantit ative easing in the United 
Kingdom, where the Bank of England (BOE) released a better-than-expected growth 
outlook for the U.K. economy.  The BOE and th e Bank of Japan made no changes to their 
main policy rates during the period. 
Major headline equity indexes were mixe d over the period.  Japan’s Nikkei index 
rose notably, as im
proved cor porate earnings and a pause in the yen’s rally helped boost 
equities.  In the euro area, equity prices were little changed, on net, while bank stocks 
declined almost 10 percent amid the ar ea’s financial turmoil.       
Monetary policy tightening in some  emerging Asian economies weighed upon 
global stock prices within the intermeeting period.  The People’s Bank of China raised 
the required reserve ratio for banks a cumulative 100 basis points over the period.  
Chinese authorities also announced that th ey were discussing possible price-control 
measures to counter rising inflation.  In addition, the Ba nk of Korea and the Reserve 
Bank of India increased policy rates.  China’s Shanghai Com posite Index fell in the wake 
of Chinese policy actions, while emerging mark et stock indexes in general were mixed 
over the period.  In Latin America, Brazil’s cen tral bank also raised reserve requirements 
late in the period to mop up liquidity.  
Capital flows to emerging market econo mies, although appearing to moderate 
over the intermeeting period, continued to pr ompt exchange market intervention and 
capital control measures.  (See “Capital Fl ows to Emerging Market Economies” in the 
International Economic Developments and Outlook section.)  Many emerging market 
economies, including South Korea, Thailand, and Turkey, were reported to have 
intervened to stem the appreciation of their currencies.  Taiwan and Turkey took concrete 
actions to discourage certain inflows deemed  to be speculative, while authorities in 
Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand announced  that they were contemplating similar 
steps.  The Chinese renminbi appreciated slightly, on net, agai nst the dollar over the 
period, but the dollar appreciat ed against most other emerging market currencies.  
While foreign official investors made sizable purchases of U.S. Treasury 
securities in October, par tial and confidential data on custody accounts at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York show weaker purch ases of Treasury securities in November.

  This slowing of purchases lik ely reflects the appreciation of the dollar in November, 
which may have reduced foreign officials’ desire to purchase dollars in foreign exchange 
markets to stem appreciation of their currenc ies, and perhaps some slackening of private 
capital flows to emerging markets.  Fore ign private investors increased their net 
purchases of U.S. agency bonds and corporate stocks. 
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
During the intermeeting period, the Treasur y auctioned $203 b illion of nominal 
coupon securities across the maturity spectru m and $10 billion of 10-year TIPS, with 
offer amounts unchanged from previous auctions .   These auctions were generally well 
received, with bid-to-cover ratios in a range around recent averages.3   
Gross issuance of long-term  municipal bonds was very high in November, mostly 
driven by issuance of Build America Bonds, as the program approaches its scheduled 
expiration at year-end.  Short-term issuance al so picked up, largely because of $10 billion 
of revenue anticipation notes issued by Californi a.  Amid the bulge in issuance, yields on 
municipal bonds rose sharply during November  and increased further early this month, 
though the latest rise was smaller than the jump  in Treasury yields.  The ratio of yields on 
long-term municipal bonds to those on comp arable-maturity Treasury securities rose 
markedly before falling back somewhat. 
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit was about flat, on average,  over October and November.  Banks 
continued to increase their holdings of securiti es, albeit at a much slower pace than in the 
third quarter, with noticeable declines in Treasury securities posted by some large banks 
in recent weeks.  Core loans decreased at  an average annual rate of about 3 percent 
during October and November, continuing the tr end toward slower runoffs that has been 
evident since midyear.  The declines in Oct ober and November were attributable to a 
drop in consumer loans that was concentrated in  credit card loans, as well as continued 
runoffs in commercial real estate and ho me equity loans.  Conversely, reported 
originations of closed-end re sidential mortgages were robust,  and banks’ holdings of such 
loans have increased moderately for four consecutive months.  In addition, C&I loans 
                                                 
3 Total federal debt subject to the debt limit increased to $13.78 trillion over the intermeeting period, and 
staff projections indicate that the debt limit may be reach ed as early as the end of the first quarter of 2011, 
though the precise timing depends on Treasury operations.  To date, markets have not focused on this issue.

  edged up in both October and November, on a month-average basis, ending a string of 
monthly declines dating b ack to the fall of 2008.  
  
Other information about business lending at  banks has been mixed.  The Survey 
of Terms of Business Lending c onducted in the first week of  November showed that both 
the weighted-average interest rate and the spread on C&I loans of less than $25 million 
edged down in the survey week, although th e spread remains extremely wide.  In 
addition, according to the Call Report, unused commitments to fund C&I loans increased 
in the third quarter, especial ly at large banks; the availa ble data suggest that these 
commitments had fallen continually for at l east the preceding two years.  However, C&I 
loans with original amounts less than $1 million, a proxy for loans to small businesses, continued to decline last quarter, and unused business credit card lines—another important source of financing for sma ll businesses—expanded only modestly.   
 
According to the third-quarter Call Report data, bank profitability was little 
changed last quarter, remaining positive but well below pre-crisis levels.  As in the second quarter, banks’ net incomes were suppor ted by declines in loan loss provisioning, 
while revenue declined.  Delinquency rates were down or about flat for all loan 
categories, with significant de clines for consumer credit card  and C&I loans.  Charge-off 
rates on credit card loans al so dropped appreciably.   
 
Banks continued to boost regulatory capital ratios, likely, at least in part, because 
of the need to eventually meet stricter Basel III standards.  Capital ratios also have been 
partially supported by restrictions on banks’ dividend payments that were put in place in early 2009, but some banks are reportedly pos itioning themselves to pay dividends in 
coming quarters.

In November, M2 expanded at an annual rate of 5 percent, somewhat below its 
pace in October.  Over the past several months, M2 has grown more than would have been predicted based on its re lationship with nominal GDP a nd opportunity costs, but the 
deviation has not been large compared with historical model errors for M2 growth.  
Liquid deposits, the largest component of M 2, continued to grow rapidly in November, 
while the contraction in sm all time deposits and retail money market mutual funds 
persisted.
5  The ongoing compositional shift toward  liquid deposits likely reflects the 
extremely low interest rates available on all M2  assets, including thos e that provide less 
safety and liquidity.  In November, currency gr ew at an annual rate of about 10 percent, 
with indicators suggesting particularly robus t demand from abroad.  The monetary base 
increased at an annual rate of 3¾ percen t in November (see the box “Balance Sheet 
Developments over the Intermeeting Period”). 
                                                 
4 On November 17, the Federal Reserve Board issued guidelines for evaluating proposals by large bank 
holding companies to undertake capital actions in 2011, such as increasing dividend payments or 
repurchasing or redeeming stock. 
5 Transaction deposits grew rapidly in November becau se of a four-day suspension of the retail sweeps 
program at one large commercial bank in order to allow system maintenance to be performed.  Total liquid 
deposits were unaffected by the event, as the suspension resulted in an equivalent decrease in savings 
deposits.

 Balance Sheet Developments  over the Intermeeting  Period 
Total assets of the Federal  Reserve edged up to almost  $2.4 trillion over the 
intermeeting  period (see table).   In line with FOMC  policy, total securities  
holdings rose $69 billion, as Treasury  purchases  outpaced  runoffs of agency debt 
and agency mortgage ‐backed securities.   
The Trading Desk at the FRBNY  conducted  a number  of operations  to purchase 
longer‐term Treasury  securities  over the  intermeeting  period.  The operations,  
which covered a range  of maturities  for nominal  securities  as well as one 
operation in  TIPS, resulted in a $98.5 billion increase in  Treasury  securities  
holdings.1  The Desk has temporarily  relaxed its 35 percent per issue  limit on 
SOMA holdings  of individual Treasury  issues, and  holdings  of 23 issues now 
exceed this limit.  The majority  of the issues for which the  SOMA now holds 
greater than 35 percent are  30‐year bonds  with remaining  maturities  between  
2 and 10 years.   The SOMA' s largest ownership  concentration  is 50 percent,  and it 
owns this amount of three  separate issues, all  of which are 30‐year bonds  with a 
remaining  maturity  of about 10 years.  
Loans outstanding  under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities  Loan  Facility (TALF) 
dropped about $2 billion over the intermeeting  period, reflecting  prepayments  of 
TALF loans.  Support  for specific  institutions  remained  about unchanged.  
On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet,  the Treasury’s  general 
account decreased $36  billion, on net, over the intermeeting  period, while the 
supplementary  financing  account held steady at $200  billion.  The  Federal 
Reserve conducted  an additional  small‐ scale operation under the  Term Deposit 
Facility; term deposits  outstanding  remain at about  $5 billion.  In terms of  other 
Federal Reserve  liabilities,  Federal Reserve  notes in circulation  climbed $9 billion, 
and reserve balances  of depository  institutions  increased  $93 billion.   
Finally, on October 29,  the FRBNY began to hold, as  agent, the cash proceeds  
from the disposition  of certain assets  held by AIG.  As announced  in AIG’s 
recapitalization  plan on September  30, these cash  proceeds,  which currently  
total about $27 billion, will eventually  be used to repay the  credit facility 
extended  to AIG by the FRBNY as well as other intere sts owned by the U.S. 
government.   These holdings  reduce reserve balances  by $27 billion.  
  
                                                 
1 These  figures  for securities  holdings reflect only trades that have settled.  Over  the 
intermeeting  period, the Trading Desk committed  to purchase,  but has not settled, an 
additional  $8.9 billion of Treasury securities.

Appendix 
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Surve y on Dealer Financing Terms  
Overall, respondents to the December 2010 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on 
Dealer Financing Terms indicated an easing in credit terms with respect to counterparty 
relationships and securities financing tran sactions over the previous three months.1  Dealers also 
noted an increase in demand for funding for all typ es of securities considered in the survey.  By 
contrast, respondents reported little change in th e terms and conditions prevalent in over-the-
counter (OTC) derivatives markets over the reference period.2   
 Dealers indicated that they had loosened cr edit terms offered to each of the distinct 
classes of counterparties—including hedge funds and other private pools of capital, insurance companies and other institutional investors, and nonfinancial firms—considering all transaction types covered in the survey.  More aggressive competition 
from other institutions and an improvement in the current or expected financial strength of counterparties were frequently cited reasons  for the loosening of terms.  As in the 
September survey, respondents also noted an in crease in the intensity of efforts by clients 
in each major class to negotiate more-favorable terms. 
 Similar to the September survey, only a few respondents indicated that they had increased 
the amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated credit 
exposures to dealers and other financial inte rmediaries.  The pattern observed in the 
September and December surveys represents a notable shift from the June survey in 
which more than half the respondents reporte d an increase in the resources and attention 
devoted to the management of concentrated credit exposures.   
                                                 
1 The December survey collected qu alitative information on changes over the previous three months in 
credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.  In 
addition to the core set of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about changes since the 
beginning of 2010 in demand for, and respondents’  willingness to fund, high-yield corporate bonds; a 
second set of special questions fo cused on demand for, and respondents ’ willingness to fund, exposures to 
syndicated leveraged loans through total return swaps (TRS) during the same period; and a final set of special questions regarding respondents’ assessments  of the effects of recent legal uncertainties 
surrounding legacy residential mortgage-backed securitie s (RMBS).  The 20 institutions participating in the 
survey account for almost all of the dealer financin g of dollar-denominated secu rities to nondealers and are 
the most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives mark ets.  The survey was conducted during the period 
from November 15, 2010, to November 26, 2010.  The core questions ask about changes between September 2010 and November 2010.   
2 For questions that ask about credit terms, reported net percentages equal the percentage of institutions 
that reported tightening terms (“tightened considerably” or “tightened somewhat”) minus the percentage of institutions that reported easing terms (“eased considerably” or “eased somewhat”).  For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the percenta ge of institutions that reported increased demand 
(“increased considerably” or “increased somewhat”) minus the percentage of institutions that reported 
decreased demand (“decreased consid erably” or “decreased somewhat”).

   As in the September survey, responses to questions about OTC derivatives transactions 
suggested that nonprice terms were little ch anged across different types of underlying 
asset classes (underlyings), considering both plain and customized derivatives.  
 With respect to securities f inancing transactions, respondents reported an easing of some 
terms applicable to the funding of most typ es of collateral considered in the survey.  
Dealers also noted that demand for funding of all types of securities had increased over 
the past three months, including demand for funding of equities, which was reported 
largely unchanged in the September survey.  
 Responses to special questions about the funding of high-yield corporate bonds pointed to 
an increase in demand for funding relative to the beginning of 2010, particularly on the 
part of private pools of capital and, to a lesser extent, dealers (and other financial 
intermediaries).  Responses to special questions about total return swaps (TRS) 
referencing syndicated leveraged loans also  pointed to an increase in demand for these 
instruments, especially by private pools of capital and, to a lesser extent, dealers (and 
other financial intermediaries) and insura nce companies, pension funds, and other 
institutional investors.   
 With respect to the supply of such funding,  the majority of respondents indicated that 
their willingness to expand financing of high- yield corporate bonds or the provision of 
exposure to syndicated leveraged loans throug h TRS at prevailing market rates and under 
prevailing market terms had remained basically unchanged.  
 Dealer responses to special questions regarding the effects of recent legal uncertainties relating to improper handling of foreclosure documents, compliance with securitization 
and servicing agreements, and possible repurchase obligations with respect to  previously securitized mortgage loans indicated that liqui dity and market functioning had worsened 
somewhat in the private-label RMBS market.
 
COUNTERPARTY TYPES  
Dealers and other financial intermediaries  
As in the September survey, the vast majority of respondents reported that the amount of 
resources and attention devoted to management of  concentrated exposures to dealers and other 
financial intermediaries had rema ined basically unchanged over the past three months, with only 
three institutions pointing to an increase.  These r esponses contrast with those to the June survey, 
also conducted during a period of heightened c oncern about European financial conditions, in 
which over one-half of dealers reported an increase.  The vast majority of respondents also noted 
that the volume of mark and collateral disputes w ith dealers and other financial intermediaries, a 
rise in which is generally viewed as a leading indi cator of market stress, had remained basically 
unchanged over the previous three months.

  Hedge funds, private equity firms, a nd other similar pools of capital  
Consistent with the September survey, the responses indicated that, across all types of 
transactions covered in the survey, dealers pr ovided somewhat more-favorable credit terms over 
the past three months to hedge funds, private equity firms, and other similar private pools of 
capital (private pools of capital).  One-fourth of respondents, on net, eased price terms, which 
include most importantly financing rates.  Nearly one-half of institutions, on net, reported having 
eased nonprice terms, which include haircuts, maximum maturity, covenants, cure periods, and cross-default provisions or other documentation f eatures.  The institutions that reported an easing 
of terms pointed to more aggressive competition from other institutions, an improvement in the 
current or expected financial strength of counter parties, and an improvement in general market 
liquidity and functioning as the main reasons for the changes.
3  More than one-half of the 
respondents to the December survey noted an increas e in the intensity of efforts by private pools 
of capital to negotiate more-favorable price a nd nonprice terms over the past three months.  
Looking forward over the next three months, most dealers expected price and nonprice terms applicable to private pools of capital to remain basically unchanged, while a small net fraction of 
respondents indicated that they anticipate an easing of terms. 
Insurance companies, pension funds, and other institutional investors 
The survey responses indicated that dealers also provided more-favorable credit terms for 
insurance companies, pension funds, and other in stitutional investors (institutional investors).  A 
small net fraction of respondents reported havi ng eased price and nonprice terms over the past 
three months.  No respondents reported tightening either price or nonprice terms.  The most important reason indicated for easing terms was more aggressive competition from other institutions.  Improvements in current or expected  financial strength of counterparties were also 
cited.  One-half of the dealers reported an in crease in the intensity of efforts by institutional 
investors to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the past three months.  Looking forward over the next three months, mo re than one-fourth of respondents, on net, 
expected credit terms applicable to in stitutional investors to ease somewhat.  
Nonfinancial corporations 
The responses to questions about credit terms applicable to nonfinancial corporations also 
pointed to a modest easing over the past three mont hs.  Small portions of r espondents, on balance, 
indicated that they had eased price and nonprice terms.  The most important reason cited for easing terms was an increased willingness of instituti ons to take on risk.  The other factors cited 
as exerting the greatest influence on dealers’ policies toward nonfinancial corporations over the 
past three months included more aggressive co mpetition from other institutions, improvements in 
general market liquidity and f unctioning, adoption of less stri ngent market conventions, and 
                                                 
3 An ordinal ranking of reasons for loosening or tightening is produced by adding the number of 
respondents characterizing each reason as “very impor tant” to the number char acterizing the reason as 
“somewhat important” and then sorting the sums in descending order.  For reasons with the same ranking 
based on the sums, the response that the greater number of dealers characterizes as “very important” takes 
priority.

  improvements in the current or expected financial strength of counterparties.  More than one-third 
of respondents indicated that there had been an incr ease in the intensity of efforts by nonfinancial 
corporations to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the past three months.  
Looking forward over the next three months, the majority of dealers noted that they expected 
credit terms to remain basically unchanged, while a small net fraction of respondents indicated 
that they anticipate somewhat looser terms.  
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES  
As in the previous two surveys, responses to questions dealing with OTC derivatives 
trades pointed to little change over the past thr ee months in the terms for “plain vanilla” and 
customized derivatives across the various underlying s—foreign exchange, interest rates, equities, 
credit, commodities, and total return swaps referencing nonsecurities (such as bank and whole 
loans).  Of note, there was no indication in res ponses to the December su rvey of an increase in 
mark and collateral disputes with respect to OTC foreign exchange derivatives as was reported in 
the September survey. However, small net portions of respondents active in the OTC interest rate 
and OTC equity derivatives markets continued to  report an increase in the volume of such 
disputes with respect to contracts referencing those underlyings. 
SECURITIES FINANCING  
As in the previous survey, responses to questions that were focused on securities 
financing pointed to an easing of some terms under which a broad spectrum of securities were being funded.
4  This reported loosening of terms was generally evident for both average clients 
and most-favored clients.  With regard to  terms under which high-grade corporate bonds are 
funded, net shares of survey respondents ranging between 20 and 40 percent reported an 
extension in the maximum maturity, an increas e in the maximum amount of funding, and a 
decrease in haircuts.  With respect to terms under which equities are funded (including through repo-like stock loan transactions), net fractions  of dealers ranging between 10 and 25 percent 
indicated that they had extended the maximum maturity, increased the maximum amount of funding, and decreased the financing rate.  Regarding terms under which agency RMBS are 
funded, net portions of respondents ranging be tween 22 and 28 percent noted that they had 
extended the maximum maturity and increased the maximum amount of funding.  Finally, with respect to terms under which ABS other than agency RMBS are funded, net fractions of dealers ranging between 15 and 31 percent reported an exte nsion in the maximum maturity, an increase 
in the maximum amount of funding, a decline in financing rates, and a loosening of covenants 
and triggers. 
Survey respondents indicated that dema nd for funding for all types of securities 
considered in the survey had increased over th e past three months.  The net fractions of 
respondents that noted an increase in demand were similar to those in the September survey; the only exception was the share of dealers that reported an increase in demand for funding of 
                                                 
4 In this survey, securities financing includes lending to clients collateralized by high-grade corporate 
bonds, equities, agency RMBS, and other ABS.

  equities, which was considerably higher.  On ba lance, about 30 percent of dealers that lend 
against agency RMBS, ABS other than agency  RMBS, and equities reported an increase in 
demand for funding in the December survey, while one-fifth of survey respondents that lend 
against high-grade corporate bonds indicated that demand for funding had increased.   
Respondents indicated that liquidity and f unctioni ng in several markets had improved 
over the past three months.5  More than 40 percent of dealers reported an improvement in markets 
for ABS other than agency RMBS, while a simila r fraction of respondents noted an improvement 
in the high-grade corporate bond market.  By contr ast, the vast majority of dealers indicated that 
liquidity and functioning in the agency RMBS market had remained basically unchanged.   
Survey respondents generally reported that the volume of collateral and mark disputes 
with clients related to the funding of collateral  of all types had remained basically unchanged.   
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON THE FUNDING OF HIGH-YIELD CORPORATE BONDS  
 In response to special questions about the funding of high-yield corporate bonds, one-
third of dealers active in this market, on net, noted an increase in the demand for funding relative 
to the beginning of 2010.  In explaining the reported change in dema nd, respondents cited the 
behavior of private pools of capital and, to a lesser extent, dealers (and other financial 
intermediaries) as important.  The majority of respondents reported that their willingness to fund 
high-yield corporate bonds at prevailing market rates and under prevailing market terms had 
remained basically unchanged. 
 
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON THE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS REFERENCING 
SYNDICATED LEVERAGED LOANS  
In response to special questions about TRS re ferencing syndicated leveraged loans, one-
third of respondents active in this market, on balance, reported an increase in demand for 
exposure to these instruments relative to the beginning of 2010.  Responde nts cited the behavior 
of private pools of capital and, to a lesser exte nt, dealers (and other financial intermediaries) as 
well as institutional investors as important in explaining the increase in demand.  As in the case of 
high-yield corporate bonds, the majority of survey respondents reported that their willingness to provide exposure to syndicated leveraged loans through TRS at prevailing market rates and under 
prevailing market terms had remained basically unchanged. 
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON THE EFFECT OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES 
SURROUNDING LEGACY RMBS 
 
On net, about
 30 percent of respondents repor ted that the liquidity and functioning of 
RMBS markets had worsened somewhat as a resu lt of the legal uncertainties relating to the 
improper handling of foreclosure documents, compliance with securitization and servicing 
                                                 
5 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repurchase agreements and similar secured 
financing transactions, not changes in the funding market itself.

  agreements, and possible repurchase obligations on th e part of financial institutions with respect 
to previously securitized mortgage loans.6  The reported effects were largely concentrated in the 
private-label RMBS market. 
                                                 
6 Among the 13 firms indicating material activity in the RMBS market, the four respondents reporting 
that liquidity and functioning in this market have been adversely affected all fall within the top decile of 
dealers measured by market share,  and together account for a market share of approximately 37 percent.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we consider a number of alternatives 
to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first scenario, we 
consider the possibility that the economy will recover more vigorously than we expect.  The second scenario considers the contrasting risk of an even more sluggish recovery in aggregate demand than we are projecting.  We then turn to opposing risks to the inflation outlook—that we will exper ience the more -pronounced disinflation predicted by some of 
the staff’s reduced -form models or, alternatively, that concerns about the System’s large 
balance sheet and the long -run fiscal outlook in the United States will push inflation 
much higher than in the baseline.  The final two scenarios consider risks of recession in Europe, including potential financial spillover effects to the United States and our major non-European trading partners. 
In the alternative scenarios, monetary policy responds to movem ents in real 
activity and inflation as prescribed by a simple policy rule for the federal funds rate, while nontraditional policy is assumed to follow the baseline path.  We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and an estimated policy r ule.  The last two 
scenarios are generated using the multicountry SIGMA model, which uses a different policy rule for the federal funds rate that employs an alternative concept of resource utilization.

Stronger Recovery  
T
he baseline projection shows the recovery picking up speed gradually in coming 
quarters.  But both household and business spending may gather steam more rapidly than we anticipate, reflecting a mutually reinforcing dynamic of improved optimism, higher spending, greater hiring, and increasi ng credit availability.  This scenario examines the 
consequences of a snapback in outlays on consumer durables, housing, and business 
capital by assuming that the pickup of spending in these categories approximates the sort 
                                                 
1  For FRB/US, the federal funds rate follows the “outcome -based” rule, described in the appendix on 
policy rules in Book B.  In the case of SIGMA, its rule is broadly similar but uses a  measure of slack that is 
the difference between actual output and the model ’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the 
absence of a slow adjustment in wages and prices.

  of pronounced cyclical rebound typically seen after deep recessions.  The resulting 
stronger activity and improved optimism also buoy financial markets and push equity 
prices 12  percent above baseline by the end of next year; financial conditions improve 
further into 2012.  This virtuous circle causes real GDP to expand 5¼ percent in both 2011 and 2012, bringing the unemployment rate down to 7 percent by late 2012.  With less slack, inflation is higher; however, the upward pressure is partially checked by more capital deepening, and thus by larger productivity gains, which hold down unit labor 
costs.  Under these conditions, the federal funds rate begins to rise in late 2011 and 
remains above baseline thereafter.  
Weaker Recovery  
Ongoing financial headwinds and lingering uncertainty could r estrain consumer 
and business confidence more than we expect.  Moreover, impaired credit conditions may be muting the stimulative effect of low interest rates on household and business spending more than we have assumed.  In this scenario, the modest expec ted improvements in 
confidence, credit conditions, and the labor market underlying our baseline projection are delayed even further.  As a result, the personal saving rate climbs to 7¾ percent by the end of 2012 and firms are more reluctant to boost capital spending.  In this environment, house prices fall 10 percent relative to baseline over the next two years, and residential investment is essentially flat; in addition, financial market participants reassess the outlook for earnings and the riskiness of holding equities, causing share prices to fall 
about 7 percent relative to baseline by late next year.  Real GDP expands only 2¼  percent 
next year and labor market conditions stagnate, so that the unemployment rate hovers a 
bit below 9½ percent through the end of 2012.  Inflation falls in response to more-persistent slack and remains below baseline through 2015.  Liftoff of the federal funds rate from its effective lower bound is delayed until the second half of 2014. 
Greater Disinflation 
In the baseline, in flation remains relatively stable over the next two years and then 
begins to rise as unemployment declines in an environment of well-anchored inflation expectations.  But the stability of various measures of expected inflation to date may be misleading us about the potential for further disinflation in a persistently weak economy.  In this scenario, actual inflation falls below zero by 2013 and remains negative thereafter —a decline that is in line with the predictions of some of our forecasting 
equations that do not condition on survey measures of expected inflation.  With inflation

  continuing to fall, the perceived riskiness of holding bonds is assumed to increase.  As a 
result, bond term premiums rise and put upward pressure on real long- term interest rate s, 
thereby modestly damping spending and boosting unemployment relative to baseline over 
the next few years.  In response to lower inflation and greater economic slack, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound until the middle of 2014.  In the longer run, monetary policy is sufficiently stimulative to eventually bring the unemployment rate below baseline and to check the deflationary pressure.  
Higher Inflation   
The extraordinary expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the 
deterioration of the long-run fiscal outlook in the United States carry a risk of putting 
upward pressure on expected, and hence actual, inflation.  Indeed, some commentators have viewed the rise in commodity prices over the past year as a harbinger of such a development.  In this scenario, inflation expectations move up markedly over the next two years, creating a situation in which actual inflation shifts up to 3 percent within a few 
years.  In addition, the unmooring of long-run expectations is assumed to be accompanied 
by greater uncertainty about future inflation prospects, and thus higher term premiums on long-term interest rates.  The latter development, in conjunction with an earlier and more pronounced rise in the federal funds rate in response to higher inflation, results in tighter financial conditions that noticeably slow the pace of the economic recovery over time. 
Mild European Recession 
In the baseline forecast, we project that the European economies will expand at a 
modest pace next year.  In thi s scenario, we assume that financial stress in Europe 
intensifies and pushes Europe into a mild recession by early next year.  Specifically, European real GDP falls about 2 percent relative to baseline in 2011 as sovereign and private borrowing costs rise, notwithstanding a depreciation of the euro of about 10 percent against the dollar.  In response to the stronger dollar and weaker foreign activity, real net exports decline in the United States.  These developments cause U.S. 
real GDP to expand more slowly over the next two years, leaving the unemployment rate 
about ¼ percentage point above baseline by the end of 2012.  Core inflation in the United States is ¼  percentage point below baseline in 2011 and 2012, reflecting both lower 
import prices and greater  resource slack.  With lower inflation and greater slack, the 
federal funds rate runs a bit below baseline after a liftoff in early 2013; the easier stance

  of monetary policy, coupled with a gradual improvement in European conditions, 
provides support to economic activity in the longer run. 
Severe European Recession with Contagion 
In this scenario, we assume a much larger rise in European sovereign and private 
yields than in the previous scenario and a considerably larger fall in the euro.  Moreover, 
the problems in European financial markets are assumed to have pronounced spillover effects on financial markets in the United States and in our major non-European trading partners.  Specifically, higher European sovereign spreads cause corporate bond spreads 
in Europe to rise about 300 basis points by early next year relative to baseline, and 
European GDP falls more than 5 percent relative to baseline next year despite a 
depreciation of the euro of over 20 percent against the dollar.  U.S. net exports are adversely affected by the stronger dollar and weaker foreign activity, and domestic demand is restrained by a 50 basis point rise in U.S. corporate bond spreads, a weaker stock market, and reduced confidence.  Altogether, U.S. real GDP growth falls about 
1¼ percentage points below baseline in 2011 and about 1 percentage point below 
baseline in 2012, and the unemployment rate remains above 9 percent through most of 2012.  The greater resource slack, coupled with lower import prices, pushes PCE inflation 
down to about ¼ percent in 2011 and 2012.  The federal funds rate remains near zero until late 2013.   
OUTSIDE FORECASTS  
The last available Blue Chip forecast was released in early November, and hence 
is now out of date.  However, an updated Blue Chip survey will be released on December 10, and we will circulate a note to the Committee then summarizing its results.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
NAIRU. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionarychanges in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The annual FI estimates are on a calendar year basis. Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicateaggregate demand stimulus.
