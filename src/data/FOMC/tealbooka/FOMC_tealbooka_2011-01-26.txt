Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
On balance, the incoming news on economic activity has taken on a stronger tenor 
since the December Tealbook.  Consumer spe nding picked up sharply in the fourth 
quarter of 2010, and—apart from its vol atile motor vehicle component—business 
investment in equipment and software has exhibited considerable vigor.  Industrial 
production (IP) has also posted so lid gains in recent months.  By contrast, conditions in 
the labor market have improved only m odestly, and the housin g market remains 
moribund.  After weighing the various indicators , we estimate that real GDP increased at 
an annual rate of 3¾ percent in  the fourth quarter, 1¼ percen tage points faster than we  
had projected in the most recent Tealbook.  
Because the economy appears to have entered 2011 with a bit more momentum  
than we had anticipated in our previous forecast, we have nudged up our projections for 
growth over the next few quarters.  Howeve r, we did not make any other material 
changes to the medium-term outlook, which had already featured an appreciable 
acceleration in real GDP this year and a further step-up in growth in 2012.  The 
conditioning assumptions underlying the forecas t are virtually the same as those in the 
December Tealbook, and given the limited improve ment in the labor market to date and 
the financial constraints and other headwinds that conti nue to weigh on spending and 
production (as well as the usual noisiness of th e high-frequency data), we were reluctant 
to extrapolate more than a little of the positive surprise going forward.  As a result, our 
point estimates for real GDP growth, at 3.8 percent in 2011 and 4.4 percent in 2012, are 
nearly unchanged from our prev ious projection.  Nevertheless, the level of real GDP is a 
little higher throughout the projection peri od.  Furthermore, we see the incoming 
information as suggesting that the downside ri sks to the outlook have diminished and that 
the recovery is on a somewhat firmer foo ting than was apparent in December.   
As for inflation, the incoming data on core  consumer prices have been about in 
line with our expectations.  But with the project ed margin of slack a little smaller than in 
the December Tealbook, and with some additional upward pressure on domestic prices from the pass-through of higher energy and impo rt prices, we have added 0.1 percentage 
point to our forecast for core inflation, which is now expected to be 1 percent in both 
2011 and 2012.  Given our projections for c onsumer food and energy prices, overall

consumer prices are forecast to rise a bit faster than core prices in 2011 and at the same  
rate as core in 2012. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
We have made only minor adjustments to our assumptions for monetary policy 
this round.  As in the December Tealbook, we a ssume that the FOMC will hold the target 
federal funds rate in the curre nt range of 0 to ¼ percent unt il the first quarter of 2013.  
We also assume that the Federal Reserv e will expand its holdings of longer-term  
securities by about $80 billi on per month through the sec ond quarter of 2011, slightly 
quicker than in the December Tealbook.  Th e faster pace of purchases was announced by 
the Open Market Desk on January 12 and is  anticipated to still bring the securities 
holdings in the SOMA portfolio to about $2.6 tr illion.  In addition, we continue to assume
that the Federal Reserve will reinvest principal payments from its securities holdings 
through early 2013.        
Financial Conditions  
Our projections of long-term interest rates are similar to thos e in the December 
Tealbook.  The yield on 10-year Treasury secu rities has increased about 10 basis points 
more than we anticipated, and we have slightly  raised the projected level of this yield in 
the near term.  However, we had already b een expecting Treasury yields to move up 
significantly over the medium term, and we have  interpreted the recent rise as an earlier 
realization of that increase than we had anti cipated.  As a result, we did not revise the 
projected level of the 10-year Treasury yield in 2012.  As has been true for some time, 
the main factor contributing to  the projected rise in the 10-year Treasury yield over the 
medium term is the movement of the valu ation window through the projected period of 
near-zero short-term interest rates.  Since the December  Tealbook, yields on investment-
grade corporate bonds and inte rest rates on conforming fi xed-rate mortgages have 
changed little, on net, and we have made only negligible revisions to the projections for 
those interest rates.  
The Dow Jones U.S. Stock Market Index is about 3 percent above the level 
anticipated in the December Tealbook.  Stoc k prices have reportedly been boosted by 
growing confidence among market participants in the strength of the economic recovery.  
Nevertheless, the equity premium remains well above longer-run norms.  Therefore, we 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
January 19, 2011
Page 3 of 105
Authorized for Public Release
expect stock prices to continue to increase at  an elevated pace over the projection period, 
on the order of 11 percent per year, as the equity premium  falls back to more typical 
levels.  
Recent readings point to renewed weakne ss in house prices.  Most notably, the 
CoreLogic repeat sales index fell 1½ percent 
in November, somewhat more than we had 
expected, and now stands below its previous trough in early 2 009.  These data have led us 
to mark down the level of home prices th roughout the projection period about 1 percent. 
Fiscal Policy 
We have made only small changes to our fiscal policy assumptions.1As before,
we assume that appropriations for discre tionary spending in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 
will be roughly constant in nominal terms a nd that current tax policies will remain in 
place.  Thus, we continue to expect that federal fiscal policy actions will be a roughly 
neutral influence on aggregate demand in 2011 as the impetus from the one-year cut in 
social insurance taxes and from the business expensing provision is essentially offset by 
some reduction in stimulus-related grants to state and local governments.  In 2012, fiscal 
actions are expected to impose a drag of about  1 percent of GDP as the payroll tax cuts 
lapse, the expensing provision is scal ed back, the Emergency Unemployment 
Compensation (EUC) program is phased out, an d the stimulus grants are essentially 
exhausted.    
As in the December projection, we expect the budget deficit to reach $1.4 trillion 
(9 percent of GDP) in fiscal 2011 and then narrow to $1.1 trillion in fiscal 2012 (around 
7 percent of GDP), primarily reflecting th e further tapering off of stimulus-related 
policies and the higher revenues associated with a faster pace of economic activity.  
Correspondingly, federal debt is projected to rise to 71 percent of  GDP at the end of 
fiscal 2012.  
1 While the fiscal package enacte d in December is close to what we had assumed in the previous 
Tealbook, it differs in two minor ways.  First, it provides slightly higher emergency unemployment benefits 
in 2011 than we had anticipated.  Second, it allows bu sinesses to claim 50 per cent bonus depreciation on 
most equipment and software acquired in 2012, in addition to the full expensing in 2011 assumed in our December forecast.

Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
The incoming data on activity abroad ha ve also been stronger than we had 
anticipated and suggest that foreign real GDP expanded at a 3 percent annual rate in the 
fourth quarter, beating its third-quarter s howing by 1 percentage point.  The acceleration 
was driven by faster growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs), while activity in 
the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) rema ined sluggish.  Going forward, we project 
overall foreign growth to move up to more than 3½ percent in 2012—an outlook that is a 
little stronger than in the December Teal book.  Activity in the EMEs should remain 
robust over the forecast period, and growth in the AFEs is expected to pick up, although 
fiscal consolidation in some advanced countri es and an uneven lifting of financial stresses 
in Europe will likely temper the recovery .  
The real value of the dollar is curren tly about 1 percent lower than we had 
projected at the time of the December forecas t, and the staff’s expectations for foreign 
monetary policy rates ov er the forecast period have been  revised up by an amount similar 
to the market’s expectations.  In light of these developments, the projected path for the broad real dollar starts at a lower level but follows the same contour as in the December 
forecast.  This path has the dollar depreciati ng at an annual rate of about 3 percent over 
the rest of 2011 and at a somewhat faster pace in 2012, as the firming global recovery lessens official resistance in the emerging Asian economies to more-rapid currency appreciation against the dollar.  
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
Oil prices have moved higher relative to the December Tealbook projection as 
favorable incoming data on economic activity both in the United States and abroad 
suggest a more robust outlook for global oil demand.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil cl osed on January 18 at $91 per barrel, $3 higher than at the 
time of the December Tealbook, and prices of  futures contracts through the end of 2012 
have moved up more than twice that amount.
2  Based on these futures quotes, we project 
that the spot price of WTI will end 2012 at nearly $96 per barrel, more than $6 higher 
than in the previous Tealbook. 
2 Spot prices of other grades of crude oil have risen more than the WTI spot price, in large part 
because near-record high in ventories in Cushing, Oklahoma, the deliv ery point for WTI, have held recent 
gains in spot WTI in check.

What  Explains the Recent I  ncrease  in  Commodity  Prices ?  
After changing little, on net ,  during  the  first half  of  2010,  commodity  prices  
started to move up in  the late summer and have continued to increase at  a brisk  
pace in recent  months  (see figure below) .  The price increases  have been broad -
based, with prices for metals, foods, and oil all recording sizable gains.    As  
indicated  in  the left  figure on the facing  page, the price s  of many industrial 
commodities  now exceed their 2008  peaks ,  although oil is a n otable exception .   
We interpret the recent  rise  in commodity prices as  primarily reflecting  
developments in fundamentals, in particular the interaction of robust increases in  
global demand with a  number  of idiosyncratic supply  constraints.  A recovery in  
world  industrial production  (see left  figure  on the  facing  page ), led by strong  
economic  growth in the  emerging market economies, pushed demand  for oil and  
many  metals  above pre-crisis peaks.  These  increase s in demand have  generally  
exceeded the response of  supply, such that reported inventories of oil and many  
metals  have started to edge down from the elevated levels that  had persisted  
since the onset  of the financial crisis.  Agricultural prices  also have  been pushed  
higher by  a strong  rise in demand.  In addition ,  adverse weather conditions have 
reduced  harvests  and  curtailed supplies of important products  in  a number of key  
exporting countries, in cluding  Russia and  Ukraine  (wheat)  and  the United States  
and South America  (corn) .  
The exchange value of  the dollar was  an additional factor contributing  to dollar-
denominated  commodity  price  movements  through  much  of 2010 .  Movements  
in  commodity  prices generally tracked the dollar through November.  Since late 
November, however, the  increases  in commod ity  prices seem  mainly  to have 
reflected  increased optimism regarding prospects  for global economic growth , 
as the dollar has leveled out but commodity prices  have continued to climb .

Page 7 of 105Tracking futures prices, our forecast calls for commodity prices to flatte n out at 
their current elevated level.  This forecast is consistent with a scenario in which 
supply expands to meet increased demand.  In the oil market we assume that the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) will eventually 
increase production quotas, cutting into the 6 million barrel per day buffer of 
spare capacity that it has maintained over the past two years (see right figure 
below) .  In addition, agricultural output is expected to recover from recent 
weather- related disruptions, and m etals supply should edge up, partly in 
response to higher prices.   As usual, the uncertainty around this forecast is 
considerable and, although we have found no better framework for forecasting 
commodity prices, the track record of futures prices has been poor.  At any rate , 
stronger-than -expected global growth or additional supply disruptions likely 
would push commodity prices still higher.   
Authorized for Public Release
Since the December Tealbook, prices for a broad array of nonfuel commodities 
have continued to move up.  The gains ha ve been supported by sizable increases in 
demand, particularly in the EMEs, as well as sh ortfalls in supply in some cases (see the 
box “What Explains the Recent Increase in Comm odity Prices?” for a dditional detail).  
Consistent with quotes from futures markets,  we project that nonfuel commodity prices 
will rise more than 6 percent (not at an a nnual rate) in the curren t quarter but will then  
flatten out over the remai nder of the forecast period. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
As noted above, we now estimate that re al GDP rose at an annual rate of 
3¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Although residential construction remained 
weak, consumer spending rose sharply, and—leaving aside a plunge in  its volatile motor 
vehicle component—business outlays for equi pment posted another hefty gain.  Net 
exports appear to have contributed a remarkab le 3½ percentage points at an annual rate to 
growth last quarter, but this positive contribution was partially  offset in our forecast by a 
marked slowing in the pace of inventory inve stment.  We expect real GDP to increase 
3½ percent in the first quarter as consum er spending and business fixed investment 
continue to rise briskly, while net expor ts and inventory inve stment flatten out.   
Labor Markets  
The incoming information indicates that labor demand has con tinued to increase 
at a gradual pace.  In the payroll surv ey, private nonfarm employment rose 113,000 in  
December—close to the forecast in the previous Tealbook—and was up about 130,000 
per month, on average, over the last three months of 2010, similar to the average pace 
over the first nine months of the year.  In  the household survey, the unemployment rate 
fell 0.4 percentage point in December to 9.4 percent; this decline—which in part was 
associated with a surprising drop in the part icipation rate—exceeded our expectations and 
more than reversed the run-up in the jobless rate that had occurred in October and 
November. 
Other indicators also point to ongoing modest improvements in labor market 
conditions.  The weekly data for initial claims for unemployment insurance have been erratic of late, but the four-week moving av erage has continued to move down and now 
stands near its lowest level since August 2008.  The drop in recent job losers in the 
December labor market report also suggests that layoffs have continued to ease.  
Meanwhile, indicators of hiring appear mixe d:  Although data from JOLTS suggest that

hiring is no better now than it was a few m onths ago, measures of job openings and 
employers’ hiring plans have shown some noticeable improvement.   
Putting this information together, we con tinue to expect the pace of em ployment 
growth to pick up in coming months, with private payroll in creases projected to average 
160,000 per month in the first quarter.  The proj ected pickup in job growth is a bit less 
than in our previous forecast, largely becau se the trajectory of monthly payroll data 
heading into 2011 now looks a li ttle shallower than before.  In addition, we expect the 
unemployment rate to reverse some of its outsized December decline in January before 
edging back down. 
The Industrial Sector  
After a pause during the summer and ear ly autumn, gains in manufacturing 
production seem to have picked up recently, a nd we expect this fa ster pace of output 
growth to continue in coming months.  Outs ide of motor vehicles, factory output posted 
widespread gains in November and December,  and the recent strength in new orders and 
in national and regional purchasing managers’ re ports points to further solid increases in 
production in early 2011.  And, while total motor vehicle production stepped down to an 
annual rate of 7¾ million units in the fourth quarter, assemblies are scheduled to move up 
to an 8½ million unit pace in the current quart er as automakers seek to restock dealer 
inventories that had been drawn down by unexp ectedly strong consumer demand late last 
year.  All told, we project that manufacturing production will increase at an annual rate of 
nearly 7 percent in the current quarter afte r rising 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter.  
Excluding motor vehicles, manufact uring IP is expected to rise  at a 5½ percent rate in the 
current quarter after posting a 4½ percen t gain in the fourth quarter.  
Household Spending  
We estimate that real PCE rose  at an annual rate of 4 pe rcent in the fourth quarter, 
nearly 1½ percentage points faster than we anticipated in the previous Tealbook and 
roughly twice the average pace over the first th ree quarters of the year.  Sales of light 
vehicles rose to an annual rate of 12¼ milli on units in the fourth quarter, ¾ million units 
higher than in the third quar ter and the best quarterly reading since mid-2008 (see the box 
“Sales of Light Vehicles in the Downturn and Recovery” for additional detail).  And 
although retail sales of non-auto goods were up only a little in D ecember, that slowing

Page 11 of 105Sales of Light Vehicles in the Downturn and Recovery  
The plunge in sales of light motor vehicles in the recent recession was large by historical 
standards , exceed ing the drops that followed the oil shocks and recessions of the 1970s and 
early 1980s.  Vehicle sales, the black line in the left figure below , declined 40 percent 
between the end of 2007 and the first quarter of 2009, and the drop in vehicle spending 
accounted for about one-half of the decline in overall final sales over this period.  While the 
rise in unemployment and the contraction in household wealth were key contributors to the 
decline in vehicle sales , the severity of the drop was exacerbated by a substantial disruption 
to auto lending, a steep run-up in gasoline prices through the summer of 2008, and a spate 
of bankruptcies in the motor vehicle industry that depressed the value of trade- in vehicles 
for some households . 
Light v ehicle sales began to recover in the second half of 2009, when the economy and 
financial markets began to stabilize and portions of the U.S. auto industry had been 
restructured. The federal government’s vehicle scrappage incentive program (“Cash for 
Clunkers”) provided a temporary boost to sales in the summer of 2009, but gains in sales 
otherwise remained modest through the summer of 2010.  The recovery in vehicle demand picked up steam near the end of 2010, as consumer sentiment toward car- buying conditions 
edged up , the labor market improved a bit more, and automakers raised sales incentives.  
Sales were also supported by low interest rates , a greater willingness by lenders to extend 
credit to households with lower credit scores , and the continued recovery of securitization . 
Despite the recent upturn in vehicle demand, sales remain well below the staff ’s underlying 
sales trend (the red line in the left figure below ), which is estimated from population 
growth , long -run changes in income, and patterns of scrappage. A lthough we expect sales 
to rise more rapidly in 2011 and 2012, sales are still expected to fall short of their trend.  As shown in the right figure below , the per capita stock of light vehicles declined in 2008 and 
2009 after having been relatively flat, on net, over the past decade; t he pace of sales we 
anticipate in the staff forecast would likely cause vehicle sto cks to recede further over the 
next two years . This shortfall poses an upside risk to the forecast.

followed appreciable gains in October and November.3  Looking forward, consumer 
spending should get a boost in th e current quarter from the st art of the temporary payroll 
tax reduction, but we se e little else to suggest that the sharp pickup in spending growth in 
late 2010 will be sustained.  In particular, gi ven relatively subdued gains projected for 
employment and wage income in coming mont hs, along with the relatively low level of 
consumer sentiment through early January, we  expect PCE growth to ease back to 
3 percent this quarter—a pace more in line with the underlying fundamentals.  
In an environment of soft demand and a large inventory of foreclosed or 
distressed properties on the market, homebuildin g has stayed at a slow pace.  In the 
single-family sector, new units were star ted at an average annual rate of only 
436,000 units in the fourth quarter, and home  sales—though up a little from the pace that 
prevailed just after the expi ration of the homebuyer tax cr edit—remained near cyclical 
lows.  Households’ concerns about the pr ospects for jobs and incomes are likely 
continuing to weigh on housing demand, and although conventional mortgage rates are 
still low by historical norms, many house holds do not have the down payment or good 
credit history required to obt ain such loans.  Moreover, as noted, house prices have 
softened again and likely will remain under pressure in coming quarters from a continued high level of distress sales; thus , expectations of further decl ines in house prices may also 
be restraining demand.  Given these factors, we expect li ttle, if any, improvement in 
housing activity in early 2011.   
Business Investment  
Real investment in equipment and soft ware (E&S) appears to have posted a 
relatively meager gain in the fourth quart er after rising nearly 20 percent over the 
previous four quarters.  The deceleration was due mainly to a sharp drop in net outlays on 
motor vehicles as fleet sales to businesse s paused after several quarters of strong 
purchases by rental car companies and as busin ess sales of used cars to consumers (which 
are treated as a negative for E&S in the NIPAs) surged.  Apart from transportation 
equipment, outlays for E&S appear to have rise n at an annual rate of  about 11 percent last 
quarter, the same as the gain in the third quarter.  
3 Moreover, some holiday-related  spending seems to have shifted over time from December to 
January and February—a phenomenon that is probab ly not fully captured in the seasonal adjustment 
factors.

 Looking ahead, business outlays for moto r vehicles should rebound in the current 
quarter as fleet sales rise and a step-up in purchases of heavy trucks follows the upturn in 
orders for these vehicles in  late 2010.  Meanwhile, new orders for nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft have been running a bove shipments for seve ral months, pointing 
to further near-term increases in shipments.  The fundamental s are also consistent with 
solid near-term gains in E&S outlays:  Output growth has picked up; the latest readings 
on business conditions are relatively upbeat; and credit conditions, though probably still 
tight for small businesses, have generally  continued to improve.  Accordingly, our 
projection has real E&S outlays rising at an annual rate of 13½ percent in the current 
quarter after a gain of 4 pe rcent in the fourth quarter.  
Nonresidential construction continues to be constrained by high vacancy rates, 
low property values, and tight lending condi tions.  Based on monthly data through 
Novemb
er, we estimate that real nonreside ntial construction outsi de of drilling and 
mining was little changed in the fourth quarter  at a level about 40 pe rcent below that of 
early 2008.  Consistent with recent readings on architectural billings —which tend to be a 
useful indicator of building activity seve ral months out—we e xpect nonresidential 
construction to remain near this level in ear ly 2011.  Given the high price of crude oil, 
investment in drilling and mini ng structures should continue to move up in the near term, 
but the increases in our forecast are considerab ly smaller than those realized over the first 
three quarters of 2010. 
Real nonfarm inventory invest ment appears to have slow ed substantially in the 
fourth quarter after having soared  in the third quarter; this slowing is estimated to have 
subtracted 3 percentage points at an annua l rate from GDP growth.  Roughly one-half of 
the fourth-quarter downswing is associated with a drawdown of mo tor vehicle stocks 
after an accumulation in the third quarter.  St ocks outside the motor vehicle sector also  
seem to have accumulated less rapidly in the fourth quarter than they did in the third 
quarter, judging from the relatively small in creases in the book value of manufacturing 
and trade stocks in October and November.  Ov erall, inventories appe ar well aligned with 
sales:  Book-value inventory-sales ratios toward the end of 2010 were close to their pre-recession norms, and with the exception of construction materials, chemicals, and 
primary metals, most sectors represented in the staff’s flow of goods system appear to 
have reasonably comfortable inventory positions .  In our forecast for the current quarter, 
inventory investment moves up somewhat (mainly because of a rise in motor vehicle stocks) and thus should be a sm all plus for real GDP growth.

Government  
After factoring in the information on defense expenditures from the Monthly 
Treasury Statement s for November and December, we  estimate that real federal 
purchases rose at an annual rate of 1 percen t in the fourth quarter after two quarters of 
much larger gains; we expect purchases to rise  modestly in the current quarter as well.  In 
the state and local sector, ongoing fiscal pressures are being re flected in further job cuts 
while construction outlays—though erratic from quarter to qu arter—continue to trend up 
after the steep declines of late 2009 and early 2010.  In our forecast, real purchases by 
state and local governments post a small decline in the fourth quarter after two quarters of 
slight increases, and they are expected to  be unchanged in the cu rrent quarter; these 
relatively small ups and downs largely reflect swings in construction outlays. 
Foreign Trade  
After taking on board the trade data for Oc tober and November, we estimate that 
real imports of goods and services fell at an a nnual rate of nearly 14 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2010, 10 percentage points more  than we anticipated in the December 
Tealbook.  This dramatic drop in imports followed two quarters of rapid growth and was 
largely attributable to a steep decline in report ed real oil imports, pa rt of which owed to 
quirky seasonal adjustment fact ors.  But it also reflected a contraction in non-oil imports, 
as the vigorous rebound of imports from their depressed levels during the financial crisis 
appears to have run its course.  Given the so lid pace of activity in the United States, as 
well as the likelihood that some of the weakne ss in imports in the fourth quarter was due 
to temporary factors, we expect real import gr owth to rebound at an annual rate of more 
than 9 percent in the first quarter, 4½ per centage points faster th an in our previous 
forecast.  
Supported by brisk foreign demand and so me stimulus from the dollar, real 
exports of goods and services appear to have increased at an annual rate of 9 percent in 
the fourth quarter; we expect them to continue  to rise at around this pace in the current 
quarter.  This profile for e xports is slightly stronger than in the December Tealbook, 
reflecting the information in the recent mont hly trade reports and the stronger indicators 
lately for foreign real activity.  
With imports falling and exports rising a ppreciably, we estimate that net exports 
added 3½ percentage points to GDP grow th during the final quarter of 2010, a 
contribution 1¾ percentage points more positiv e than in the December Tealbook.  For the 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook

current quarter, we expect the pickup in imports to cause the external sector’s 
contribution to GDP growth to turn slightly ne gative, compared with the small plus in the 
previous forecast.  
Prices and Wages  
Core inflation has remained low.  The core PCE price index increased 0.1 percent 
in November after having been nearly unc hanged over the preceding four months, and 
our translation of the CPI and PPI data for December suggests that co re PCE prices were 
close to flat in that month as well.  Base d on these readings, we estimate that core PCE 
prices rose at an annual rate of just 0.6 percent for the four th quarter as a whole, held 
down by a large decline in goods prices and so ftness in prices for a variety of market-
based services.  We continue to think that part  of the low rate of core inflation in late 
2010 was transitory, and we expect it to pick up to nearly 1 percent in the current quarter 
as higher import prices show through to goods prices and as prices of market-based 
services return to a more normal rate of incr ease.  Total PCE prices are projected to rise 
at an annual rate of about 2 percent in both the fourth and first quarters, pushed up by 
large increases in consumer energy prices.  
Measures of long-term inflation expecta tions have not changed significantly of 
late.  Median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation ex pectations from the Reuters/University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers for early Janua ry stood at 2.8 percent, the same as over 
the preceding three months.  Since the time of the December Tealbook, the TIPS-based 
measure of five-year inflation compensation has risen 0.3 percentage point, likely pushed 
higher by rising prices for oil and other co mmodities and by the firming of the economic 
outlook, while the five-year forwar d measure has been about flat. 
As we had expected, average hourly earnings rose at an a nnual rate of 2 percent in 
the fourth quarter, consistent with our forecast for a 2 percent increase in hourly 
compensation.  Compensation growth is projected to move up to 2½ percent in the 
current quarter as employers are required  to raise their cont ributions to state 
unemployment insurance funds.  Given these compensation gains and our projections of 
productivity growth, unit labor costs are expected to be l ittle changed on net over the 
fourth and first quarters.

THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
Our medium-term forecast is very similar to that in the December Tealbook, with 
real GDP projected to increas e 3¾ percent in 2011 and 4½ per cent in 2012.  Nonetheless, 
the incoming data suggest that the level of activity at the end of  2010 was ¼ percentage 
point higher than we had anticipated, and we have nudged up our forecast for growth in 
2011 in response to the favorable recent news.  As a result, the proj ected level of real 
GDP in the fourth quarter of 2012 is somewhat  higher than in our previous forecast, and 
the unemployment rate—at 7¾ percent—is ¼ percentage point lower.  
Our forecast continues to feature a steady acceleration of private demand that 
more than offsets the waning of the impetus fr om federal fiscal policy.  The strengthening 
in private demand is expected to come about  as the financial repair process proceeds, 
credit availability improves further, and the adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth 
lessen.  A further recovery in the labor ma rket should also help shore up household 
confidence.  However, some  significant negatives, incl uding importantly the high 
vacancy rates for residential and commercial real estate and the budget problems of state 
and local governments, are st ill weighing on the outlook.  As a result, we continue to 
project a recovery that is s ubstantial, but less robust than  those that have typically 
followed deep U.S. recessions.  
The projected gains in consumer spending reflect many of the same forces that we 
anticipate will drive the broade r economic recovery.  In addition, PCE growth receives a 
boost in 2011 from the one-year reduction in payroll taxes, though some of that boost is 
reversed in 2012 when the tax cut expires.  In all, we expect  real PCE to rise 3½ percent 
this year and 3¾ percent in 2012.  Largely because spending is projected to respond 
gradually to the extra disposable income ge nerated by the payroll tax cut, the personal 
saving rate is expected to move up to around 6 percent this year but  then drop back to 
5¼ percent in 2012, a shade below our current estimate for the four th quarter of 2010. 
Similarly, business outlays on equipment and software are projected to post solid 
gains over the next two years as rising sale s, improved business confidence, and greater 
credit availability induce firms to replace aging capital and expand their capacity.  In fact, 
we have revised up our forecast in response to the faster growth in business output in the 
near term and the additional tax incentive in 2012 that we brought into the forecast this 
round.  In all, we now expect real E&S ou tlays to increase 13 ½ percent in 2011 and

10½ percent in 2012, roughly 1 percentage point per year faster than in the December 
Tealbook.  
Given the ongoing strengthening of foreign activity and a depreciating dollar, real 
exports of goods and services should also contribute importantly to dom
estic production; 
in our forecast, exports expand at an average annual rate of nearly 9 percent in 2011 and 
2012.  At the same time, real imports are proj ected to rise 6¼ percen t on average, as the 
pull of robust U.S. demand overcomes the drag from the depreciating dollar.  In all, net 
exports are expected to be a small positive for GDP growth over the projection period.   
The construction sector is unlikely to provide much im petus to growth over the 
next two years.  In the December Tealbook, we significantly revise d down our projection 
for housing construction, and we have largely maintained that forecast here.  As before, 
we expect housing demand to firm a bit in co ming quarters as the de clines in house prices 
taper off and prospects for jobs and incomes improve.  But many households will likely 
continue to find it difficult to finance ho me purchases, and the drag on homebuilding 
from the overhang of distressed and vacant homes will probably lessen only slowly.  Thus, we project just a gra dual resuscitation of new cons truction, with single-family 
housing starts reaching an annual rate of  660,000 units by the end of 2012—more than 
200,000 units higher than in the fourth quarter  of 2010 but still well below the pace we 
believe is consistent with the longer-run demand for housing.  Nonresidential construction is likely to remain depressed as  well, constrained by hi gh vacancy rates, low 
prices for commercial real estate, and lending conditions that will likely be tight for some time. 
 Government purchases are also projected to make only a very small contribution 
to real GDP growth over the medium term.  Reductions in spending related to overseas 
military operations and the phasing out of stimulus-related nondefense spending are 
expected to hold the increase in  real federal expenditures to 1 percent this year and to 
zero in 2012.  In the state and local sector, tax collections seem to be picking up—albeit 
from a very low level—and our forecast for economic activity implies significant further increases in revenues over the next two years.   But the cyclical increase in revenues will 
be offset by the ending of federal stimulus grants, and thus real spending by these 
jurisdictions is proj ected to rise just ¼ percen t in 2011 and 1¼ percent in 2012.

AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR  MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU  
We have made no material changes in this  Tealbook to our estimates of aggregate 
supply.  We continue to assume that poten tial GDP will increase about 2½ percent per 
year over the projection period as a step-up in capital deep ening is largely offset by a 
deceleration in structural multifactor productiv ity.  We have also retained our assumption 
that the NAIRU will remain  at 6 percent through 2012.4  
Productivity and the Labor Market 
As with our forecast of real  activity, the forecast for the labor market is similar to 
that in the December Tealbook.  As before, the gap we estimate between actual labor 
productivity and its structural level is projec ted to narrow over the medium term as firms 
add workers to meet rising production needs and to relieve pressu res on their existing 
workforces.  Thus, while we have trimmed our  near-term forecast for private employment 
a bit, we continue to project that employment growth will pick up noticeably over the 
course of the projection period.  In particular, we expect private job gains to average roughly 270,000 per month in the second ha lf of 2011 and 300,000 per month in 2012.  
Consistent with this employment outlook, our forecast calls for actual labor productivity 
to rise 1½ percent in 2011 and 2 percent in 2012, a little less than our estimate of its 
structural growth rate.  
The projected job gains in this forecast lead to a gradual reduction in the 
unemployment rate over the next two years.  Our forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of 2011, at a little under 9 percent, is the same as in the pr evious Tealbook, as the 
effect of the slightly stronger output growth  in this forecast is offset by our revised 
assumptions about the availability of benefits under the EUC program.  The unemployment rate is projected to move down steadily over the course of 2012, largely because of the above-trend growth in GDP, but also reflecting the tapering off of 
extended and emergency unemployment benef its; our projection for the unemployment 
4 We did make a small adjustment to our estimate of the effective NAIRU, which includes the 
influence of extended and emergency unemployment benefits and is the level of the unemployment rate 
that we view as being consistent with no slack in the labor market.  In particular, our revised assumptions about the EUC program imply an upward revision of ne arly 0.2 percentage point to our estimate of the 
effective NAIRU by late 2011, but that effect largel y disappears by the end of 2012.  We still think the 
effective NAIRU is in the neighborhood of 6½ percent at present and will declin e to around 6 percent by 
the end of 2012.

rate in the fourth quarter of that year is 7¾ percent, ¼ per centage point lower than in the 
December Tealbook.  
Resource Utilization 
We estimate the amount of economic slack to be sizable at presen t and expect it to 
remain so over the next two years; in particular , the level of real GDP is projected to still 
be about 3¼ percent below the level of pot ential output at the end of 2012.  Similarly, by 
our reckoning, the unemployment rate will be 1¾ percentage points above the effective 
NAIRU at the end of 2012, compared with an estimated unemployment gap of about 
3 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2010.  This extended period of labor market 
slack is likely to be associated with othe r features of a weak labor market, including 
below-trend labor force participation, a high percentage of workers who are involuntarily 
on part-time schedules, and an unusually larg e concentration of workers experiencing 
long-duration unemployment spells. 
The margin of unused plant capacity in the industrial sector should be taken up 
more rapidly than the slack in the economy as whole, in part because manufacturing 
capacity seems likely to expand slowly over th e forecast period; indeed, we project that 
manufacturing capacity will incr ease just 1 percent this ye ar and 1½ percent in 2012.  As 
a result, by the end of 2012, our projection cal ls for the factory operating rate to be 
around its long-run average despite the still-sizable GDP gap prevailing at that time. 
Compensation and Prices 
Given the high unemployment rates and lo w rates of price inflation in our 
forecast, we expect labor costs to remain  subdued over the projection period.  In our 
forecast, the Productivity and Cost measure of nonfarm hourly compensation rises about 
2 percent in 2011 and 2¼ percen t in 2012, while the employment cost index increases at a 
roughly similar rate.  Combined with the mode rate gains in productivity  that we project, 
these increases in compensation imply only a small rise in unit labor costs over the 
medium term. 
Prices of imported core goods (all g oods excluding fuels, computers, and 
semiconductors) appear to have increased at an annual rate of a bout 6 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2010, pushed up by higher co mmodity prices and dollar depreciation; 
we expect them to increase at nearly this p ace in the current quarter,  as commodity prices 
rise further and foreign inflation stays hi gh.  These near-term in creases are somewhat

larger than those in the December Tealbook, but we still expect import price inflation to 
taper off noticeably in coming quarters and to be down to about 1½ percent in 2012, as 
commodity prices level off and the effects of dollar depreciation wane. 
As discussed in the box “Pass-Through of  Industrial Commodity Prices to Core 
Inflation,” we do not expect the run-up in industrial commodity prices to have m
uch 
effect on domestic core inflation.  Accord ingly, even after taking on board the higher 
prices for commodities, imports, and energy—as well as the slightly smaller margin of 
resource slack—in this Tealbook, we  have raised our forecast for core PCE inflation just 
0.1 percentage point, to 1 per cent in both 2011 and 2012.  The basic story of our inflation 
forecast is unchanged—namely, that while th e substantial slack in  resource utilization 
will continue to exert downward pressure on inflation over the projection period, that 
influence will be muted by the continuing stab ility of long-run infl ation expectations.  
Given our path for food and energy prices, total PCE inflation is expected to be a little 
faster than core inflation in 2011 and in line with core in 2012.  
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2015 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assessments of long-run supply- side conditions, fisc al policy, and other factors.  The 
contour of the long-run outlook depe nds on the following key assumptions: 
  Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long run, 
consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections provided by 
FOMC participants at the November meeting. 
  The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities follow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B.  We assu me that the projected decline in the 
System’s holdings beginning in 2013 will contribute about 25 basis points to the rise in the 10-year Treasur y yield over the 2013–15 period.  
  Beyond 2012, risk premiums on corporate equities decline gradually to 
normal levels, and banks ease their lendi ng standards somewhat further.   
  The federal government budget deficit na rrows to about 4½ percent of GDP 
by the end of 2015.  This improvement re flects the effects of the economic 
recovery on tax receipts and transfer payments as well as further policy 
actions after 2012 aimed at  reducing the deficit.

  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assum ed to depreciate 
¾ percent per year in the 2013–15 period.  The price of WTI crude oil edges 
up a bit after 2012 and reaches $98 per ba rrel by 2015, consistent with futures 
prices.  Under these assumptions, movements in the prices of energy and 
imports have only minor implications for domestic inflation in the extension.  Foreign real GDP expands, on average,  about 3¼ percent per year from 2013 
through 2015, a bit abov e its trend rate. 
  Over the 2013–15 period, the NAIRU declin es from 6 percent to 5¼ percent, 
as the functioning of the labor market improves.  Potential GDP expands 3 percent per year on average.  
The economy enters 2013 with the staff’s estimate of the output gap quite wide, 
the unemployment rate well above the estimate d NAIRU, and inflation very low.  In the 
long-run projection, improving confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and supportive 
financial conditions eventually enable the level of aggregate demand to catch up with 
aggregate supply and inflation to move closer to 2 percent.  Specifically, real GDP rises 
at an annual rate of 4½ per cent in 2013 and 2014, considerably faster than its potential 
pace; as a result, unemployment declines a ppreciably and inflati on rises slowly.  In 
response, the federal funds rate begins to in crease in the first quarter of 2013 and reaches 
3½ percent by late 2014.
5  By 2015, with improvements in confidence and financial 
conditions largely complete, and with the federa l funds rate climbing further to 4 percent, 
gains in real GDP moderate.  Neverthele ss, overall economic growth remains robust 
enough relative to potential to reduce the une mployment rate to the NAIRU by late 2015; 
in addition, inflation continues to  rise and reaches 1½ percent.  
5 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions of the “outcome-based” 
rule, described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.

Pass -Through of  Industrial Commodity  Prices  to  Core  Inflation  
Although prices  for crude oil, natural gas, and farm commodities are important  
determinants of consumer energy and food prices, prices for other industrial 
commodities  typically  have only a small effect on our projection  of core  inflation.  
Accordingly , even though core commodity  prices  have risen  sharply  over the past  
couple of years —in many  cases  rising above pre- crisis levels —we do not expect  
these price increases to significantly boost  core inflation  in  the medium  term .  
Several factors account for the s mall estimated  pass -through  of  commodity  price 
increases into core inflation.  First, core industrial materials account for only a small fraction —around 1  percent —of  the overall cost of producing core consumer 
goods and services.  Roughly three- fourths  of  core consum er  spending is on  
services, which  are not materials  intensive.  In addition, even for a good like an  
automobile,  the cost of iron, rubber, and glass is small compared with labor costs  
and the cost  of financing plant and equipment.  
Moreover, th e  cost share  of commodities —which we estimate using input -output  
tables  to compute the total amount of raw  materials that is  eventually  needed to 
produce a dollar of core personal consumption expenditures ( PCE)—likely  
overstates the m  edium -term effect of cha nges in  materials prices on  finished  
goods prices.  For example, part of the cost  of producing air travel in the input -
output framework reflects  the cost of  the aluminum  that is used to build the 
airplanes  that an airline uses.  If the price of aluminum  were to jump, we would  
expect this  cost increase to put upward pressure on the price of new airplanes and  
eventually on airfares and core PCE  prices.  But  this  pass -through would  be drawn  
out over a long period of time,  and would be attenuated in the short run to the 
extent  that  aircraft  manufacturers , airlines , or both  allowed  their price- cost  
margins  to absorb some of  the cost increase and in the longer run  to the extent  
that aircraft  manufacturers  shifted to lower-cost  production methods.  Thus, 
changes in  raw material prices probably have a smaller effect on a given  year’s  
core inflation rate than a straight application of  the cost share would imply.  
As a result, even when commodity  prices rise at double -digit rates, they tend  to be 
associated with much smaller changes in intermediate and final goods prices.  The upper panel of the figure on the facing  page plots 12 -month  changes  in the core 
crude producer price in dex ( PPI)—t he black line—a nd the core intermediate PPI — 
the red line—w ith the shaded  areas  indicating periods  of significant  core crude PPI  
inflation (other broad- based indexes of  core commodity prices  move in a similar 
manner).  Changes in intermediate price inflation are much  smaller than the  swings  
in crude price inflation ; the echoe s  in  core consumer price inflation —which is  
plotted against  core intermediate PPI inflation in the lower panel —are smaller still  
(note the change in scale across  the two panel s).

Page 31 of 105Hence , given the size of the pass -through effect that we estimate, we expect that 
the commodity price increase s that we have seen so far will add only a s mall 
amount to core inflation.  However, a risk to our projection is that recent 
commodity price m ovements have been driven by upward revisions to expected 
future demand or prices.  If these developments reflect either a stronger projected 
recovery than we have assumed in the staff forecast or a broader rise in inflation 
expectations , then the run -up in commodity prices that we have seen could be a 
precursor of higher general inflation .

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Economic data that we have received since the previous Tealbook appear to 
confirm  a strengthening g  lobal recovery, though one that remains on two  track s.  Much of  
the current  strength  is centered in the emerging market economies (EME s), where  growth 
is expected to remain robust over the forecast period.  In contrast, we estimate that 
fourth -quarter  growth in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs)  stayed  subdued.  
However, as households  and firms in the AFEs  repair their balance sheets  and labor  
markets improve, the recovery in these countries seems poised to firm .  That said , 
developments in the euro -area periphery  continue  to pose a significant risk to the global  
outlook, with market participants increasingly expecting the Portug uese government  to be 
force d to seek financial  assistance .  Assuming that the  need for such measures  does not  
spread  beyond Portugal , with attendant spillovers to global financial markets , we expect  
that foreign GDP  growth  will rise from its 3  percent pace last quarter to more than  
3½ percent in 2012.  This  outlook is a little  higher than in the December Tealbook, in part  
as recent data have been  somewhat  stronger  than  we had expected .  
Foreign inflation rose to an estimated 5  percent in the fourth quarter, mostly  
because of an  acceleration of  energy  and food prices.  (See the box “What Explains the  
Recent Increase  in Commodity Prices? ” in the Domestic Economic Developments and 
Outlook section.)  T he still-considerable  economic slack in the AFEs should keep 
inflation pressures contained, and we expect that  AFE  central banks  will keep policy  
accommodative over the fo recast period.  In contrast , inflation pressures  appear to  be 
building in the EMEs.  In response, a number of EME central banks  have continued to 
tighten policy  and allowed some currency appreciation .  We assume that policy will be  
tightened  further, although ongoing concerns  about capital inflows will  keep EMEs  
cautious about raising rates .   
ADVANCED FOREIGN  ECONOMIES  
The step -down in growth in the AFEs  in the  summer persisted into  the fourth 
quarter , and we  continue  to project that economic  growth will pick up only  modestly over  
the course of this  year and next.  Although prospects for manufacturing have improved 
amid a resurgence in global trade, the outlook for  activity more generally  remains  
relatively subdued.  The  outlook is  especially damped  in Europe, where domestic demand 
will be restrained by  heightened  fiscal consolidation and continued financial  stresses.  We

have maintained the  working hypothe sis that the  debt crisis in Europe will be cont ained  
without significant disruptions to financial markets and economic activity  outside the  
peripheral economies .  In our view, this outcome  requires several  actions by  European 
authorities .  They will have to increase the funds  available for  financial assistance to  
countries in distress.  Also, they  must take additional measures to shore up confidence in 
the banking sector, including  more -stringent  stress tests  where a number of banks are 
required to raise additional capital .  Further, the E uropean C entral  Bank (ECB) needs to  
continue to provide liquidity and purchase sovereign bonds.  
Consumer prices in the AFEs accelerated  mar kedly  around year -end, driven by a  
run-up in food and energy  prices.  However, underlying  inflationary pressures remain  
generally subdued amid considerable  economic slack, so we  anticipate that inflation will  
edge back down over the forecast period as increases in food and energy prices moderate.  
Although monetary policy  in the major AFEs will  remain  accom modative  over the 
forecast period, we now  assume that central banks will begin  tightening  monetary policy  
sooner than in the December Tealbook. 
Euro Area  
We  estimate that real GDP growth  in the euro area  remained around 1½ percent at
an annual  rate in the fourth quarter.  Industrial production, manufacturing purchasing  
managers indexes (PMIs), and industrial confidence showed considerable  recent strength,
supported in part by a rebound in exports.  However, t his strength remains concentrated  
in  Germany and to a lesser extent  in other core  economies.  E conomic performance wa s 
generally  stagnant or declining in the euro -area periphery ( Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and 
Spain ).  Moreover, the improved business conditions have not spill ed over to the e uro-
area household sector:  Consumer confidence  has  softened , and  retail sales  have declined 
sharply.    
 
Recent data have led us to revise up  our projection of euro- area growth  in 2011 to 
1¼ percent,  but this is still slightly  slower than  in the second half of 2010, as the twin  
headwinds of fiscal consolidation and financial turmoil more than offset support coming  
from the depreciation of the euro.  E uro-area GDP growth  should then move up to 
2¼ percent in 2012.  We expect GDP in the euro -area periphery to stagnate  in 2011 and 
to lag g  rowth in the rest  of the euro area in 2012.

Market sentiment toward the euro -area periphery  deteriorated through early  
January on the  expectation that increasing funding di  fficulties for  Portugal’s  government  
and its  banks would force  the country  to seek a rescue package  from the  European Union 
(EU) and the  International M onetary  Fund.  Sentiment recently has improved somewhat, 
however, in part on news of  the successful  government debt auction in Portugal  and on 
reports that  European officials were considering increasing the effective size and  
widening the scope of the European Financial Stability  Facility (EFSF) .  Some EU  
officials have proposed allowing the EFSF to buy  sovereign bonds in the secondary  
market ( transferring th ese operations  from the ECB) and to issue short- term lines of  
credit to member  countries facing liquidity difficulties , but German officials have voiced 
reluctance to expand the  EFSF’s  current powers.  
Despite the ongoing tensions in the euro area, we  now a ssu me that the ECB will 
begin  to  raise its benchmark policy rate, currently  at 1 percent, in the first quarter of 
2012.  The ECB is concerned about  recent increases in  headline inflation, which r ose to 
2.2 percent on a 12-month basis in December, above the  ECB’s inflation target ceiling .  
This  rise  primarily  reflects a jump in energy prices ; although core inflation  picked up a  
bit as well, it remained subdued at around 1 percent.  W e see headline inflation easing to  
around 1½ percent next  year, as  energy price inflation slows and economic slack erodes  
only slowly.  Although we now expect the ECB to kick off its policy  rate hikes  a bit 
sooner, the ECB is likely to  continue to provide  ample  liquidity to banks and purchase 
peripheral sovereign bonds.  ECB Presi dent  Jean -Claude Trichet  alluded to this  
possibility  recently , making a strong distinction between macroeconomic policy and 
liquidity policy.  
Japan  
After having risen  at a pace of 5 percent over the previous  year, Japanese real  
GDP  is estimated to have declined 1 ½ percent last  quarter.  Private  consumption likely  
contracted  as a  government subsidy  for auto purchases expired, and export s appear to  
have declined as well .  But monthly data suggest that economic activity rebounded 
towar d year -end.  Industrial production turned up in November, and manufacturers  
report ed plans to significantly increase production.  Accordingly, we are projecting  
1½ percent  growth in the current quarter.  Going f  orward, growth should pick up a bit  
further,  to 2 percent by 2012, supported by  continued improvement in the labor market, 
no significant tightening  in fiscal policy , and a little  further  easing by the  Bank of  
Japan  (BOJ).

The  Cost  of  Deflation:  The Japanese  Experience  
After four decades of strong growth, the Japanese economy  slowed sharply in  the early  
1990s  and stagnated  thereafter.  The post -1980s  period also coincided with falling  
inflation and later deflation, raising questions about the effect of disinflation and  outright  
deflation on  Japanese activity.  To address  this issue, we focused on  three transmission  
channels:  debt deflation, downward nominal wage rigidity, and  the zero lower bound  
(ZLB)  on nominal interest rates .  
In the debt deflation  channel, unanticipated declines in inflation or the price level boost  
the real value of  fixed -interest -rate debt, thereby redistributing wealth  from b  orrowers  
to lenders.  To estimate the  effect  of debt deflation on  economic  activity  in Japan , we use  
actual and expected infla tion  rates  over the past  two decades  (see  figure below )  to 
compute a sequence of inflation  surprises and apply the result s to our estimates of the 
stock of  Japanese debt with fixed interest rates.1   Although private nonfinancial sector 
debt in Japan is large, fixed -rate debt is  composed  primarily of a subset of household  
mortgage debt amounting  to only 20  percent of disposable income.  As a  consequence, 
we find that the increase in  real debt due to unexpected disinflation averaged less  than  
1  percent  of  household disposable income per year.  Assuming a standard marginal  
propensity to consume out  of wealth (5 percent), and  even without factoring in any  rise 
in  consumption  by  now -wealthier creditors, these unanticipated increases in real debt  
likely exerted a negligible drag on consumption and thus  on  real GDP  growth.  
Downward  nominal wage rigidities are another channel through which deflation  might  be 
costly.  With  sufficient  inflation, firms  needing  to cut  costs  in  real terms  may simply  slow  
the growth  of  nominal wages, but with low- to-negative inflation, cuts  in nominal wages  
are required.  If workers resist such  cuts, firms may be forced to scale back  production.  
Akerlof  and others  estimate t hat, for the United States, reducing annual (steady -state)  
nominal wage growth from 4 percent to 1 percent, as  occurred  in Japan during the first  
half of the 1990s (s hown  in  the figure below ), would lower annual output growth  0.1 to  
1 The effects of inflation surprises on loans with variable rates should be negligible because these 
rates adjust more freely to movements in inflation.

0.2 percentage  point.2   A  further drop in wage growth  to negative 1 percent, similar to 
Japan’s wage de flation by  the turn of 2000, would depress GDP growth as  much as  
¾  percentage point per year.  However, this latter estimate is generally viewed as being  
an upper bound.  Moreover, Japanese microdata indicate that wages became more 
flexible as disinflation  proceeded, and the Japanese unemployment rate did  not  surge to 
the extent predicted  by the Akerlof model.3   All told, our assessment is that downward  
wage  rigidity  is unlikely  to have held down  Japanese GDP  growth by  more than 0.1 or 
0.2  percentage point  per year.  
A third way deflation may affect activity is by constraining the exercise of  mon e tary  
policy  through conventional means .  When inflation rates, and  thus in terest  rates, are 
very low, monetary policy  may be  limited  by  the ZLB, potentially  leading  to undesirably  
high real interest rates  that  would  hinder the return  to full employment.  To assess this  
channel, we use the SIGMA model to simulate the course that  the Japanese economy  
would have taken  had the ZLB  not  been  binding.  The Asian crisis in 1998, the high -tech  
recession in 2001, and  the global financial crisis in  2008  all pushed the counterfactual 
policy rate below zero ( see  lower- left panel).  Accordingly, our admittedly uncertain  
calculations suggest that since 1998, average annual GDP growth has been depressed  
0.4  percentage point due to the presence of  the ZLB, for a cumulative output loss  of  
4½  percent  (see lower-right  panel).  Our simulations do not  explicitly  account for  the  
Bank of  Japan’s  2001 –06 quantitative easing program ,  but most observers believe that 
this  program  provided  at most a very partial offset .  
Pulling  together the different  strands, we conclude that low or negative inflation  may  
have shaved  up  to about  ⅓  percentage point  off  of  average annual Japanese growth over 
the past  20 years , with  the  bulk of  the effects being attributed to the ZLB  since 1 998.  This  
annual reduction implies a level of Japanese GDP  that is  as much as 5  to 7  percent lower 
than it would be otherwise.

November ’s  report of 12-month headline inflation remained slightly positive.   
However, core inflation, excluding energy  and food prices, continued to linger near  
negative 1  percent amid considerable  economic slack.  Accordingly, with energy prices  
leveling out, headline  deflation is set to  reemerge in early 2011 and to persist over  the 
forecast period, leading the BOJ to moderately step up its asset purchases .  Japan’s  
experience with deflation over the past two decades is examined in the box “  The Cost of  
Deflation:  The Japanese Experience.”  
Canada  
We estimate that  real  GDP  growth , having  slowed considerably  in the third 
quarter,  moved back up to 2¾ percent  in the  fourth quarter, supported by a  stronger- than-
expected  rebound in exports.  Economic activity should continue to expand at that pace in 
2011 and 2012, supported by solid growth in domestic demand , even as the strength of  
the Canadian dollar leads to some drag from net  exports.  T he withdrawal of fiscal  
stimulus should restrain  demand , but investment  is set to remain strong,  as  firms enjoy  
low borrowing  costs , abundant cash , and cheap imported machinery and equipment.  
Rising fuel prices  have boosted headline inflation, which we expect to peak at 2½ percent  
on a 12-month basis around midyear before moderating to near the 2 percent target.   Both 
our GDP growth and inflation paths are higher in the near term than in the previous  
Tealbook, leading us to bring forward our assumption of  the B ank of C anada’s next rate 
hike to the fourth quarter of 2011. 
United Kingdom  
We estimate that real  GDP  in the United Kingdom  rose 2 percent in  the fourth 
quarter, with only a limited  pulling forward of consumption in advance of  January ’s  
value- added tax  hike.  As fiscal consolidation increasingly bites,  restraining  improvement  
in private activity,  output growth should remain at around 2 percent in 2011.  Growth  
should increase to around 2½ percent by 2012, helped by  fading effects from financial  
stresses and  continued support from a weak pound.  December’s reading on  12-month 
CPI inflation , at 3.7 percent, stood well above the  2 percent target , reflecting tax  
increases , the pickup in food and energy prices, and higher import prices.  Given our  
higher inflation path, we  have brought the first rate hike by the Bank of E ngland  forward  
to the first quarter of 2012.  However, policy will remain accommo dative in the face of  
the many  factors weighing on  growth  and amid  expectations that  the surge in inflation  
will prove transitory.

EMERGING MARKET  ECONOMIES  
We now  estimate  that real GDP growth in the EMEs  rebounded to 5 percent in the 
fourth quarter.  This performance is  up ¾ percentage point  from  the December Tealbook, 
in part  reflecting  an upward spike in Singapore’s  growth, although recent widespread  
increases in exports and manufacturing  PMIs point to resurgent  growth for the  
developing world  as a w hole.  Growth is expected to remain robust this  year and next—at  
around 5 percent —as  activity  firms  in the advanced economies and domestic demand in 
the EMEs  stays strong .  Our outlook for 2011 and 2012 has been revised  up slightly , as  
global commodity prices  and domestic indicators suggest more vigor in EME activity  
than we had previously  expected. 
Inflation has picked up in the EMEs.  Although the increase largely  reflects  
accelerating  food prices, several countries , including China, show signs  of more 
widespread inflationary pressures.   Despite  increases in policy rates in several countries , 
the level of  policy rates in EMEs  overall  is still low by historical standards  and perhaps  
lower than the cyclical positions of these economies would warrant.  Monetary  
authorities in EMEs continued to show some reluctance to raise policy rates out of  
concerns that such moves could encourage  further  capital inflows and generate upward 
pressures on currencies.  Even though currency  appreciation would help moderat e 
inflation , authorities in several countries sought to limit upward pressures on their  
currencies  by imposing  new capital  controls , intervening in currency markets , or both. 
China  
Recent data suggest that the Chinese economy  continued to expand at a robust  
9 percent pace in the  fourth quarter, slightly higher than our expectations.  Industrial  
production rose briskly through November, and surveys indicate this rise  extended  into 
December .  November  nominal retail sales and fixed -asset investment remain ed  more 
than 20 percent above their  year- earlier levels.  We continue to project that Chinese 
authorities will be successful in  engineering a soft  landing, with  economic  growth of  
around 8½ percent this  year and next —near its potential rate .  
Headline consumer price inflation jumped in November, to more than 5 percent  
on a 12-month basis.  Food price  inflation  continued to be the largest contributor to the  
increase, but nonfood inflation also rose to nearly  2 percent  from 1½ percent in October.  
In response , Chinese  authorities have further tightened policy  over the intermeeting  
period, rais ing  the one- year  bank lending rate 25 basis points and hiking  required reserve

ratios for large banks 100 basis points to 19 percent.   In addition, authorities have been 
clamping down on credit  growth, and we  expect this tightening to continue.   The Chinese 
government also has allowed somewhat more appreciation of the  renminbi against the  
dollar in recent weeks, even as  reserves  continued to accumulate rapidly.  Since last  June, 
when the authorities  announced  greater  exchange rate flexibility, the renminbi has risen 
3½ percent  against the dollar but has been roughly  flat on a real trade- weighted basis.   As  
in the previous Tealbook, we project the  renminbi  to appreciate 4 per cent against the 
dollar this  year and 6 percent in 2012 as part of China’ s efforts toward  gradual  
rebalancing of  its economy.     
Other Emerging Asia  
Incoming data indicate that economic activity in the rest of emerging Asia  
rebounded in the fourth quarter, in line with the stronger pace of  activity in China.  
Exports rose  significantly  in a number of emerging Asian economies, and industrial  
production growth was  generally positive.   
The pickup in activity  across the region has been accompanied by a somewhat  
greater rise in inflation in the fourth quarter than we had previously anticipated, driven by  
the pickup in food and global commodity prices.  In response, Korea and Taiwan , among  
others, have tightened monetary  policy further and have  also taken  some  measures to  
slow capital inflows and limit upward pressures on the ir  currencies .  We continue to 
assume that Asian policymakers will allow some  moderate  further currency appreciation  
this  year and next, in line with  projected  movements in the  renminbi. 
Latin America  
After slowing  sharply in the third quarter of last  year, r eal GDP  growth in Latin  
America is estimated to have picked up only slightly in the fourth quarter, to 3 percent.  
We expect growth in the  region to rise  to 4¼ percent by next quarter  and then remain at  
that pace through the  rest of the forecast period.  In Mexico, we estimate that real GDP  
grew 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter.  Industrial  production declined slightly in October  
and November, but exports and retail sales continued to expand.  We anticipate that  
Mexican growth will increase to 4¼ percent  in the  second half of 2011 and in 2012, 
driven in part by the recovery in U.S. demand .  Food  prices  have been  boosting  Mexican  
inflation; we project inflation  there will rise  to an annual rate of 5½ percent  in the current  
quarter  before edging below  4 percent , the upper  end of the  government’s target range  of 
2 to  4 percent , by the  end of the forecast period.

We estimate that Brazil ian growth moved up to 3¾ percent in the  fourth quarter, 
boosted by  strength in  commodity  markets , lax fiscal policies , and rapid credit growth.  
GDP growth  will likely remain in that vicinity over the forecast period.  Headline 
inflation  (on a 12-month basis) rose to around 6 percent  at the end of 2010, fueled by  
both robust aggregate demand and rising  food prices.  In response to strong g  rowth and 
rising inflation, the incoming Dilma  Rousseff  government has pledged to tighten fiscal  
policies, and Alexandre  Tombini, the new central bank pr esident, has made it clear that  
fighting inflationary pressures will remain a high  priority.  At the same time , Brazilian  
authorities continued to take measures in an attempt to limit upward pressures on the  
real, including the introduction in January  o f a  60  percent unremunerated reserve 
requirement on banks’ short dollar positions.

Financial Developments 
Financial conditions improved modestly over the intermeeting period, reflecting a 
sense that the economic recovery was firmi ng.  Broad stock price indexes extended their 
stretch of strong gains, and risk spreads on corporate bonds narrowed somewhat.  Both 
short- and longer-term nominal Treasury rates were relativel y little changed, on net, over 
the period.  TIPS-based measures of infl ation compensation over the next 5 years 
increased, but they were about unchanged for th e period 5 to 10 year s ahead.  Short-term 
funding conditions remained stable, and the year-end passed without any significant or  
unexpected strains.  Over the intermeeting pe riod, the broad nominal value of the U.S. 
dollar declined more than 1 percent, partly reflecting mo re-solid growth prospects 
abroad, particularly in emerging market  economies (EMEs), along with actual and 
prospective tightening of foreign monetary policies.  However, the dollar was little 
changed against the euro amid the continued strains in the euro area.  
The latest indicators of business credit quality showed further improvement, while 
those for consumer credit quality generally confirmed the improvements seen earlier in 
the year.  However, the commercial and residential real estate segm ents have continued 
to lag.  Borrowing by nonfinancial corporat ions remained robust in December, and 
issuance of commercial mortgage-backed secu rities (CMBS) picked up in the fourth 
quarter, though from a very low level.  On the household side, consumer credit 
outstanding appears to have expanded in the four th quarter, the first quarterly increase in 
two years.  House prices continued to tre nd lower, weighed down by the large inventory 
of unsold homes and by weak demand among potential homebuyers.  
 Bank credit decreased in December, as banks shed some of the Treasury 
securities that they had accumulated earlier  in the year and core loans on banks’ books 
edged down.  Portfolio-weighted averages of responses to the January Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Pr actices (SLOOS) indicated that banks’ 
lending standards on core loans eased slightly fu rther last quarter, in the aggregate, but 
loan demand weakened (see appendix).  M2 continued to expand moderately in 
December.

TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS  
Money market futures rates and Treasury yields were somewhat  volatile at times 
but were relatively little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Both the 
December FOMC statement and the minutes of the December meeting were largely in 
line with market expectations and elicited limited price action.1  Nonetheless, the 
statement in the minutes indicating that  some FOMC members had a “fairly high 
threshold for making changes to the [Treasury purchase] program” reportedly made investors more confident that the FO MC’s purchases would total $600 billion.
2  Data 
releases over the intermeeting period generally pointed to so me firming of the economic 
recovery.  However, upward pressure on yields reportedly was moderated by expectations of only a gradual pace of im provement in the labor market, the Federal 
Reserve’s commitment to maintain an accommodative policy stance, and ongoing concerns about fiscal and banking pressures in the euro area.   
TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next five years rose 29 basis points to 
a little more than 2 percent, likely pushed  higher by rising prices for oil and other 
commodities and by the firming of the ec onomic outlook.  In addition, estimated 
probabilities of deflation during the next f our years measured from TIPS continued to 
decline over the intermeeting pe riod and now stand around 7 perc ent.  Further out, TIPS-
based inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ah ead was little changed at  about 3 percent.  
The preliminary January reading of median long-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Su rveys of Consumers was 2.8 percent, the 
same as in each of the previous three months. 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 18 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 3½ basis points. 
2 The Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York purchased $117.8 billion of 
Treasury securities over the period, reflecting purc hases under the new asset purchase program and 
reinvestment of principal payments on Federal Reserve holdings of agency MBS and agency debt.  After 
the Desk announced in November that it would tem porarily relax its 35 percent per-issue limit, it 
announced on December 20 that it would limit its holdi ngs of any single Treasury security in the SOMA 
portfolio to 70 percent of the outstanding issue.  The Desk indicated that it would purchase individual securities in progressively smaller increments as the SOMA holdings of such securities increased above the 
35 percent threshold.  In addition, on January 12, the Desk announced that it would increase its purchases of longer-term Treasury securities (excluding reinvestment s of repayments of principal on agency debt and 
mortgage-backed securities) to $80 billion over th e period between mid-January and mid-February, 
consistent with the monthly pace needed to reach $600 billion of cumulative purchases by the end of June. There was no market reactio n to that announcement.

The Desk’s continuing purchases of l onger-term Treasury securities reportedly 
had no discernible effects on Treasury market  functioning.  Thin trading volumes ahead 
of year-end and perhaps some flows related to hedging of mo rtgage convexity appear to 
have contributed to elevated volatility in Treasury yields during the early part of the 
intermeeting period.  More recen tly, market-based measures of  uncertainty about longer-
term Treasury yields declined and ended the period slightly lower, on net, likely 
reflecting in part solidifying market expectations regardi ng the ultimate size of the 
FOMC’s asset purchase program.  Uncertainty about the future path of the federal funds 
rate, measured from Eurodollar implied vol atilities, also edged down on balance. 
Neither the expected nor the modal path  of the federal funds rate changed 
appreciably over the intermeeting period.  Fu tures quotes, combined with the staff’s 
standard assump
tion about term  premiums, indicate that market participants expect the 
federal funds rate to rise above  the current target range in the first quarter of 2012 and to 
reach 1 percent by the end of  2012.  The distribution of futures rates remains highly 
skewed to the right, w ith quotes on interest rate caps con tinuing to suggest that the modal
expected federal funds rate does not rise a bove the current target range until the end of  
2012.    
The Desk’s latest survey of primary dealers also suggested that m
arket 
participants’ expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed since 
Decem
ber.  However, median expectations in  the survey for the total size and length of  
the new asset purchase program were revised down to $600 billion to be completed by 
June 2011, compared with $850 billion to be completed through the end of 2011 in the 
December survey.  Dealers also noticeably upg raded their forecasts for economic growth 
in 2011 but modestly scaled back th eir projections for growth in 2012.3  
ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad stock price indexes rose about 4½ percent, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, extending their recent strong performan ce.  The increase reflected the apparent  
firming of the economic recovery and favorable  early reports on four th-quarter corporate 
earnings, as well as the conti nued accommodative stance of monetary and fiscal policies. 
Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index remained at a relatively low level.  The

spread between the staff’s estimate of the e xpected real equity return for S&P 500 firms 
and an estimate of the real 10-year Treasur y yield—a gauge of the equity risk premium— 
narrowed further over the pe riod but remained elevated by historical standards.  
Yields on BBB-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds declined about 
5 basis points and 24 basis points, respectiv ely, over the intermeeting period, and their 
spreads over yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed a bit more.  
Near-term corporate-bond forward spreads declined, suggesting that investors are pricing 
in somewhat less default risk in the near  term, and far-term fo rward spreads—a rough 
gauge of required compensation for risk-tak ing—also inched lower.  Meanwhile, the 
average bid price in the secondary market  for leveraged loans moved up to about 
95 percent of par, continui ng its climb from a low of 60 percent in early 2009 and 
recording its highest reading since November 2007. 
Conversations with market pa rticipants indicate that the modestly rising trend in 
the use of dealer-interm
ediated leverage has continued into 2011, but a variety of 
indicators suggest that leverage remains well below the levels reached before the crisis.  
Hedge funds that focus on long-short equity stra tegies appeared to be a little more willing 
to take on risk during early January.  By cont rast, risk appetite at macro hedge funds has 
reportedly remained muted.  Overall, th e performance of hedge funds improved 
significantly during the final months of 2010, br inging the average retu rn for hedge funds 
that report to the Lipper TASS databa se to 10 percent for the year.  
Short-term funding conditions remained stable over the intermeeting period.  
Spreads of dollar Libor over OIS rates held fair ly steady across the term structure, as the 
year-end passed without signi ficant incident.  Some mode st year-end pressures were 
observed in repo markets, but they dissipated by early January.  On net, spreads on 
A2/P2-rated 30-day commercial paper rema ined low, and spreads on AA-rated ABCP 
appeared to have stabiliz ed after having been a bit volatile across year-end.   
Over the intermeeting period, bank stock pr ices modestly outperformed broader 
equity market indexes, and CDS spreads for most banks narrowed a bit.  Investor sentiment toward banks continued to be in fluenced by developments related to the 
potential for significant put-backs of mortgages from MBS pool s and to mortgage 
documentation and foreclosure issues.  An announcement by Bank of America that it had 
reached an agreement with Fannie Mae and Fr eddie Mac to resolve repurchase claims on 
residential mortgages sold to the GSEs was well received by market participants.  A

ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that voided two foreclosure sales by 
Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp is unlikely to have broader implicati ons, but it highlighted 
the continuing legal uncertainties around foreclos ures.  Also of note, a number of smaller 
financial institutions fully repaid TARP  funds toward the end of 2010, and AIG 
completed a recapitalization plan  that allowed it to repay $46 billion of Federal Reserve 
support (see the box “Balance Sheet Developmen ts over the Intermeeting Period”).   
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial  corporations was robust in the fourth 
quarter.  Net issuance of bonds was particul arly strong, supported by heavy issuance in 
both the speculative- and investment-grade se ctors.  Meanwhile, nonfinancial commercial 
paper outstanding decreased slightly over the quarter, but C&I loans posted a small gain, 
reflecting increases at many of the 25 larges t banks in December.  The SLOOS conducted 
in January indicated that demand for C&I lo ans had increased somewhat in the fourth  
quarter, especially for large and middle-marke t firms.  As in recent surveys, a modest 
fraction of banks, on net, had eased sta ndards on C&I loans somewhat, and a large 
fraction had reduced spreads on such loans.   Other data showed that issuance of 
leveraged syndicated loans—especially those funded by institutiona l investors such as 
loan mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds—has been 
robust in recent months.  Although market partic ipants reported that deal terms (including 
leverage) loosened a bit furthe r, they emphasized that some of the riskier features and 
structures that were fair ly widespread at the height of the credit boom in 2006 −07 have so 
far remained uncommon.     
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial  firms dropped back in December to 
its average pace in 2010, following the bump-up in November that resulted from GM’s 
initial public offering.  In the third quarter, equity  retirements from share repurchases and
cash-financed mergers continued apace, leav ing net equity issuance slightly more 
negative.  Incoming data on cash-financed mergers and on announcements of new share 
repurchase programs suggest a continued rapid pace of equity retirements in the fourth 
quarter.  
The fourth-quarter earnings  reporting season commenced just before the close of 
the intermeeting period, with the first wave of reports beating analysts ’ expectations by a 
wide margin.  Based on about 50 reports in ha nd and using analyst estimates for the rest, 
the staff expects operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms to post another solid

support  for  specific  institutions   by  $46  billion.   On  net,  Federal  Reserve  assets  increased   
by  $30  billion.  
The  Open   Market   Desk  at  the
  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  New  York  (FRBNY)  conducted   
21  operations   to  purchase  longer‐term  Treasury  securities   over  the  intermeeting   period.    
There  were  operations   across  the  nominal  yield   curve  as  well  as  3  operations   in  Treasury  
inflation‐protected  securities   (TIPS);  purchases   over  the  intermeeting   period  totaled  
$119  billion,  and  $118  billion  in  purchases   settled  during  the  period.1   The  Desk  has  
temporarily   relaxed  its  35  percent  per  issue  limit  on  System  Open   Market   Account  
(SOMA)   holdings  of  individual   Treasury  issues;   the  limit  is  now  70  percent.   As  of  January  
12,  2011,  SOMA  holdings  of  28  issues  with  total  par  value  of  $178  billion  exceeded   
35  percent.   The  SOMA’s  largest  ownership   concentra tion  is  currently   57  percent;  
holdings  of  four  issues  with   total  par  value  of  $21  billion  now  exceed  50  percent.   Holdings  
of  agency  debt  and  mortgage ‐backed  securities   (MBS)  declined  by  $44  billion  over   the  
intermeeting   period;  consistent   with   the  FOMC’s  directive,   these  declines  were  offset  by  
purchases   of  Treasury  securities.2  
On  January  14,  2011,
  AIG  repaid  the  credit  extended   by  the  Federal  Reserve  under  the  
revolving   credit  line,  and  the  Federal  Reserve  was  paid  in  full  for  its  preferred  interests  in  
the  special  purpose  vehicles  (SPVs)  AIA  Aurora  LLC  and  ALICO  Holdings  LLC,  thereby  
reducing  the  balances  in  these  accounts   to  zero.    
These  transactions   involved  several  steps.   First,  AIG  repaid  the  balance  on  the  revolving  
credit  facility  and  redeemed   a  portion  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s  preferred   interests  in  the  
SPVs  with  cash  proceeds   from  asset  dispositions.    These  cash  proceeds   had  been  held  by  
the  FRBNY  as  agent  and  are  shown  in  the  table  as  the  liability  item  “Funds  from  AIG  asset  
dispositions,   held  as  agent”;  as  a  result  of  this  transaction,   this  item  declined  by  
$27  billion.   Second,  AIG  purchased   the  remaining   preferred  interests  in  the  SPVs  from  the  
FRBNY  through  a  draw  on  the  Treasury’s  Series  F  preferred  stock  commitment,   a  
component   of  the  Troubled  Asset  Relief  Program,  and  transferred  the  SPV  preferred  
interests  to  the  Treasury  as  consideration   for  the  draw  on  the  available  Series  F  funds.  
1 These figures for securities holdings reflect only trades that settled over the intermeeting period. 
During this time, $7.8 billion in coupon purchases conducted earlier settled, and the Open Market Desk 
committed to purchase, but had not settled, $9.5 billion in TIPS and coupon purchases. 
2 On January 10, 2011, the FRBNY announced that it will begin a process to streamline the 
administration of SOMA agency MBS holdings by consolidating these securities through a service 
offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac called CUSIP aggregation. Through this process, aggregated 
CUSIPs are formed by consolidating existing agency MBS with similar characteristics into larger pass
through securities. This process will reduce the number of CUSIPs held in the SOMA portfolio from over 
44,000 to about 10,000.

Overall,  the  Federal  Reserve’s  direct  exposure  to  AIG,  which  peaked  at  $91  billion,  now  
has  dropped  to  zero.   The  Federal  Reserve  continues   to  have  exposure  to  the  assets  
acquired  from  AIG  that  are  held  in  Maiden  Lane   II  LLC  and  Maiden  Lane   III  LLC.   The  
balance  on  Federal  Reserve  loans  to  these  entities,  including   accrued  interest,  currently   
stands  at  $26  billion;  the  combined   fair  value   of  the  assets  held  in  Maiden  Lane  II  and  
Maiden  Lane  III  is  about  $38  billion.3   With  the  Treasury’s  investment   in  AIG  at  about  
$68  billion,  the  combined   value  of  the  Treasury’s  investments   in  AIG  and  the  balance  on  
the  Federal  Reserve’s  loans  to  Maiden  Lane  II  and  Maiden  Lane  III  now  stands  at  
$94  billion.   Total  support  provided   to  AIG  by  the  Treasury  and  the  Federal  Reserve  
peaked  at  $136  billion  in  April  2009.  
Other  notable  movements   on  the  liability  side  of  the  balance  sheet  were  in  the  Treasury’s  
general  account  and  term  deposits.    The  Treasury’s  general  account  increased   $69  billion,  
on  net,  over  the  intermeeting   period,  reflecting   typical  fluctuations   in  that  account.   Term  
deposits  declined  by  $5  billion,  to  zero,  as  the  small‐ scale  real‐value  Term  Deposit  Facility  
operation   conducted   on  November  29,  2010,  matured  on  December   30,  2010.  
3 Net portfolio holdings are measured at fair value, which is an estimate of the price that would be 
received upon selling an asset if the transaction were to be conducted in an orderly market. These 
figures reflect valuations as of September 30, 2010.

gain in operating earnings per share on a quart er-over-quarter basis.  Preliminary data 
indicate that revisions to analysts’ forecas ts of year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms 
have been positive, on balance, since mid-December.  
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms c ontinued to improve.  The ratio of liquid 
assets to tota
l assets for nonfinancial corporations stayed at reco rd highs in the third 
quarter, while the sector’s debt-to-asset ra tio declined a bit further.  Upgrades by 
Moody’s Investors Service on nonfinancial corporate bonds again outpaced downgrades 
in the fourth quarter, and the six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial firms 
remained very low in December.  The expect ed default rate for nonfinancial firms from 
Moody’s KMV declined somewhat in December, in part reflecting higher stock prices. 
In contrast, delinquency rates for broad categ ories of commercial real estate have 
not improved, and financing conditions have rema ined tight for most types of commercial 
real estate.  That said, credit appears to have become somewh at less restricted for larger 
properties in strong markets.  Issuance of CMBS, which are generally used to finance 
such properties, is scheduled in the firs t quarter of 2011 to exceed the entire amount 
issued in 2010.  However, it remains a fracti on of its pre-crisis levels.  In addition, 
commercial mortgage CDS index prices for AAA -rated securities have continued to trend 
up in recent weeks, likely refl ecting a greater willingness of i nvestors to take on risk in 
order to boost returns as well as greater clarity regarding the likely magnitude of losses 
on the structured securities.  Prices of larger  properties in strong markets have moved up, 
on net, from their lows at the beginning of 2010, while prices of other commercial 
properties continued to trend down.     
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Mortgage rates edged down a bit during the intermeeting period after having risen 
appreciably in November a nd early December, leaving th eir spreads over the 10-year 
Treasury yield down slightly.  Refinancing ac tivity, which had fallen in response to the 
increase in mortgage rates in November, re mained at a low level during the intermeeting 
period.    
House prices continued to be weighed down by the large inventory of unsold 
homes and by weak demand among potential home buyers.  According to the repeat-sales 
index from CoreLogic, house prices fell in November for the sixth consecutive month, 
leaving the index down 7 percen t since May and 2½ percent be low its previous trough in

April 2009.  An increase in sales of distressed  properties likely put additional downward 
pressure on house prices.  Overall mortgage debt  declined further in the third quarter, and 
with the housing market still weak and le nding standards remaining tight, the staff 
projects that it contracted fu rther in the fourth quarter. 
Serious delinquency rates on prime and subprime mortgages—meaning the 
fraction of mortgage loans that  are at least 90 days delinquent  and loans in the foreclosure 
process—flattened out in Oct ober and November after having  m
oved down earlier in the 
year.  The foreclosure moratoriums instituted by a number of mortgage servicers in the 
fall of 2010 may have lifted delinquency rates more recently by delaying completion of 
foreclosures.  (Once a foreclosure is completed, the mortgage is extinguished and is thus 
no longer delinquent.)  The fraction of loans transitioning from current to delinquent—a 
measure not influenced by foreclosure mo ratoriums—continued to trend down through 
November.  Issues surrounding mortgage forecl osure and documentation issues appear to 
have had little effect, to date, on house prices and mortgage financing activity.   
Signs of improvement have been more ev ident in recent months in the consumer 
credit market than in the residential mortgage  market.  Consumer credit is estimated to 
have edged up in the fourth quarter, the first increase since the third quarter of 2008.  In 
addition, delinquency rates on auto and credit card loans declined for most of 2010 and 
continue to trend toward their longer-run norms.  Meanwhile, the number of credit card 
offers mailed to households moved up cons iderably over the cour se of 2010, although in 
November solicitations remained lower than the level that prevailed from 2002 to 2006.  
Consumer ABS issuance was strong early in  the fourth quarter, supported by improved 
levels of auto ABS issuance, but auto-back ed issuance was weak in December and the 
first half of January while i nvestors and the FDIC worked to  resolve concerns about the 
treatment of securiti zations in the event that an  issuer declares bankruptcy.4  
4 The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act gave the FDIC resolution 
authority over systemically important nonbank institutions.  Investors are worried that the FDIC might 
repudiate securitization contracts in the event of the ba nkruptcy of such an institution.  On January 14, the 
FDIC issued a General Council Letter clarifying that  it would exercise its repudiation power under the 
Orderly Liquidation Authority provisions of the Dodd–Frank Act consistent with the U.S. bankruptcy code 
or other applicable insolvency laws, including those governing legal isolation.  The letter reportedly 
reassured market participants, and issu ance is expected to pick up again.

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS   
Over the intermeeting period, euro-area authorities conti nued to grapple with the 
ongoing fiscal and financial strains in the eu ro-area periphery.  Meanwhile, policymakers 
in emerging market economies took steps to address a number of challenges posed by 
rapid economic growth, including rising inflation and appreciating currencies. 
The broad nominal index of the U.S. do llar declined 1¼ percent over the period.  
The dollar depreciated against many EME cu rrencies, largely re flecting buoyant EME 
economic growth and tighter monetary policies in those economies.  In addition, 
expectations for somewhat earlier policy tightening in the advanced foreign economies weighed on the dollar’s value against the majo r currencies late in the period.  However, 
the dollar was little changed against the eur o, on net, amid the continued strains in the  
euro area.   
Greek, Irish, and Portuguese sovereign debt spreads over German bunds rose 
modestly in December and early January, as credit rating agencies downgraded the credit 
ratings on the sovereign debt of Irela nd and Portugal.  Recently, though, spreads 
narrowed in response to several relatively su ccessful sovereign debt auctions by countries 
in the euro-area peri phery, stepped-up purchases of their sovereign bonds by the ECB, 
and reports that the EU is considering expa nding the backstop capacity of the European 
Financial Stability Facility.  Overnight and te rm lending from the Eurosystem to banks in 
the periphery increased over the period.  Some modest dollar-funding pressures 
developed as the year-end approached, but th ey did not persist into January.  Market 
participants welcomed the extension thr ough August 1, 2011, of the Federal Reserve’s 
swap arrangements with the ECB and the cen tral banks of Japan, Canada, Switzerland, 
and the United Kingdom.  In addition, the Bank of England established a temporary 
liquidity swap facility with the ECB that is designed to provide Ireland’s central bank 
with sterling to help meet the potentia l needs of the Irish banking system.   
Benchmark 10-year sovereign yields incr eased about 10 basis points in the United 
Kingdom and in Germany, and measures of inflation compensation at the 10-year maturity increased 10 to 20 basis points in these countries.  Market-based readings on 
expectations of future short-term rates moved up in the euro area, the United Kingdom, 
and Canada on rising inflationa ry pressures and indications of firming economic activity.

Equity prices rose in advanced foreign economies and in most EMEs as the global 
economic outlook improved over the period.  In  contrast, the Sha nghai Composite index 
declined 7½ percent, on net,  likely in reaction to con tinued tightening by the People’s 
Bank of China, which increased its one-year  benchmark lending and deposit rates for the 
second time in two months and again raised reserve requirements to curb bank lending.  
Market participants expect further rounds of tightening in China.  The central banks of 
Chile, Hungary, Peru, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand also tightened policy 
over the intermeeting period in response to  rising inflationary pressures.   
Most emerging market currencies continue d to rise against the U.S. dollar, 
spurred by monetary policy tightening in many EMEs, by favorable EME econom
ic 
growth rates, and by rising commodities pric es.  A number of governments took actions 
to counter currency appreciation.  For exampl e, the central bank of Chile announced that 
it will begin buying $12 billion against Chilean pesos to stem the rise of the peso.  
Building on earlier moves to discourage cap ital inflows, the ce ntral bank of Brazil 
announced it would impose a reserve requireme nt on banks’ short positions in the U.S. 
dollar against the Brazilian real.  The Chilean peso and Brazilian rea l depreciated sharply 
following these announcements, although, over the period as a whole, the real is up 
1 percent against the dollar.  Central banks in Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand are also 
believed to have intervened in the foreign exchange market in recent weeks.  
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
During the intermeeting period, the Treasur y auctioned $165 b illion of nominal 
coupon securities across the maturity spectrum.   Offer amounts were in line with previous 
auctions.  On the whole, the auctions were well received, with bid-to-cover ratios 
generally close to recent averages.  On January 6, Treasury Secret ary Geithner sent a 
letter to the Congress requesting an incr ease in the debt limit currently set at 
$14.29 trillion (see the box “Deb t Subject to Limit”). 
Concerns about the credit quality of municipal bonds were heightened early in the 
intermeeting period but eased somewhat after Illinois lawmakers substantially raised the 
state’s personal and corporate income tax rate s.  Spreads on credit default swaps for the 
bonds of some major states ro se appreciably around year-end but generally have retraced 
a significant portion of those increases more recently.  Despite these improvements, the 
municipal bond market appeared to continue to  price in significantl y higher default risk 
than normal.  The ratios of yields on l ong-term general obligation bonds to those on

Debt Subject to Limit        
The  level  of  public  debt  outstanding   that  is  subject  to  the  federal  debt  limit  is  approaching   
the  statutory   ceiling  of  $14.294  trillion   set  by  the  Congress  in  February   2010.   As  of  December   
31,  2010,  debt  subject   to  limit  was  $13.973  trillion.  
An  increase  in  the  debt  limit  requires  an  act  of  the  Congress.   On  January  6,  2011,  Treasury  
Secretary   Timothy  Geithner  made  a  formal  request  to  the  Congress  that  it  raise  the  debt  limit  
by  the  end  of  the  first  quarter.    Under   our  baseline  forecast,  federal  debt  will  reach  the  debt  
limit  by  mid‐April  2011.   Our   baseline  forecast  is  consistent   with   the  Tealbook   projection   for  
government   spending,   debt  issuance,   and  Supplementary   Financing   Program  (SFP)  bill  
issuance.    As  a  result  of  the  minimal  room  currently   left  under  the  ceiling,  the  baseline  
forecast  assumes  that  new  issuance  of  SFP  bills  ceases  in  early  February   and  the  
Supplementary   Financing   Account  (SFA)  balance  falls  to  $5  billion  by  the  end  of  March.1   The  
draining  of  the  SFA  is  consistent   with  the  actions  of  the  Treasury   during  the  fall  of  2009,   
which  is  the  last  time  Treasury   debt  outstanding   approached   the  debt  limit.   
Should  the  Congress   fail  to
  raise  the  debt  limit,  the  Treasury  has  a  toolkit  of  possible  
accounting   actions  that  it  can  use  to  delay  reaching  the  debt  limit  for  a  time.    These   actions  
1 At the request of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department initiated the SFP in September 2008. 
It consists of a series of Treasury bill auctions, with the proceeds of these auctions maintained in the SFA 
held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The transfer of funds into this account acts to drain reserves 
from the banking system, thereby offsetting some of the reserve effect of the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet expansion. SFP bills are counted as marketable debt and are included in debt subject to limit.

include  redeeming   or  suspending   investment   in  selected   nonmarketable   debt  series  and  
issuing  a  small  amount  of  debt  that  is  not  subject   to  limit.   Specifically,   as  shown  in  the  table  
below,  we  estimate  that  these  tools  could  provide  an  estimated   $178  billion  of  “headroom”   
under  the  ceiling,  and,  as  shown  in  the  figure  on  the  facing  page,  could  be  used,   as  needed,  
to  delay  the  date  at  which  the  debt  limit  is  breached   until  the  end  of  June  2011.    The  specific   
tools  available  to  the  Treasury  include2  
  suspending   daily  reinvestment   in  the  Government   Securities   Investment   Fund  
(G  Fund),  a  retirement   fund  that  invests  in  nonmarketable  Treasury  securities.    The  
Treasury  has  statutory   authority   to  suspend  daily  reinvestment   if  it  cannot  be  fully  
invested  without  exceeding   the  debt  limit.   The  G  Fund  has  $125  billion  available.   
  redeeming   existing  and  suspending   new  investments   in  the  Civil  Service  Retirement   
and  Disability   Fund  (CSRDF),   a  trust  fund  that  invests  in  nonmarketable   Treasury  
securities.    The  Treasury  has  statutory   authority   to  redeem  and  suspend  investments   
if  and  when   a  “Debt  Issuance  Suspension   Period”  (DISP)  exists.   In  line  with   past  
episodes,   we  assume  a  four‐month  DISP  and  available   funds  averaging   $7  billion  per  
month.  
  disinvesting   the  Exchange  Stabilization   Fund  (ESF),  which  is  used  to  purchase   or  sell  
foreign  currencies.   The  dollar‐denominated   holdings  of  the  ESF  are  invested  in  
nonmarketable   Treasury  securities   and  the  entire  balance  matures  daily.   While  
statutory   authority   to  invest  these  balances  exists,  the  investments   are  not  required  
by  the  statute.   As  of  December,   the  ESF  balance  was  $20  billion.  
  issuing  Federal  Financing   Bank  (FFB)  debt,  which  is  not  subject  to  the  debt  limit,  but  
is  capped  at  $15  billion.   Currently,   because  $10  billion  of  FFB  debt  is  outstanding,  
only  $5  billion  is  available.   
The  current  set  of  tools  and  their  nominal  level  are  in  line  with   past  episodes.3   However,  if  a  
breach  appeared   imminent,   the  tools  would  be  used  on  an  as‐needed  basis,   and  if  the  debt  
limit  were  to  be  raised  in  a  timely  manner  after  the  debt  limit  was  reached,  only  minimal  use  
of  the  tools  might   be  necessary.    In  previous   debt  limit  episodes,   the  actual  use  of  the  tools  
ranged  from  approximately   $30  billion  to  about  $60  billion.  
2 In past debt limit episodes, one of the first actions the Treasury took was to suspend the issuance of 
State and Local Government Series (SLGS) securities. However, because the benefit of suspending SLGS 
securities issuance is only to give the Treasury more certainty over debt flows, and because any SLGS 
securities not issued will likely have to be made up by issuing additional marketable debt to replace the 
incoming cash, we do not include suspending SLGS securities in our analysis. 
3 The Treasury also has various assets it could sell to raise funds in a debt limit crisis, including equity 
stakes in selected private companies as well as $155.7 billion in holdings of agency mortgage backed 
securities. Presumably, however, the Treasury would resort to such sales only after other funding and debt 
management tools had been exhausted. Estimated Treasury Toolkit

comparable-maturity Treasury securities  and to those on AAA-rated corporate bonds 
moved up to a very high level.  Moreover, long-term tax-exempt bond funds experienced 
significant outflows over the past two months, though tax-ex empt money market mutual 
funds experienced modest net inflows.   
Despite these strains, gr oss issuance of long-term  municipal bonds remained 
strong in Decem
ber.  New capital issuance contin ued to be robust, though its strength was 
largely driven by a rush to issue Build Amer ica Bonds before the program expired at the 
end of 2010.  By contrast, refunding issuance slowed noticeably, hindered by higher 
interest rates, and the pace of short-term issuance was slow.   
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY   
Bank credit fell at an annual rate of a bout 4¼ percent in December, its weakest 
monthly reading since June as banks reduced th eir holdings of securities.  Core loans on 
banks’ books edged down again last month, but the rate of contraction still appears to be 
abating.  Indeed, after having been little changed, on bala nce, since the summer, C&I 
loans expanded at a 7¼ percent pace in December.  Despite continued weakness in many 
residential real estate indicators, closed-end residential mortgage loans held by banks rose 
moderately for the fifth consecutive month and registered the first qua rterly gain since the 
first quarter of 2008.5  Although the increase was concen trated at a few large banks, 
results from a special question included in th e most recent SLOOS suggest that the gains 
may persist:  The fraction of ba nks that attributed the recent rise in such loans on their 
books to their greater willingness to accommoda te those increases was noticeably larger 
than the fraction that attributed the rise to tr ansitory factors.  By contrast, commercial real 
estate loans and home equity loans continued to contract in December.  Consumer loans 
also decreased last month, as credit card loans dropped further while other consumer 
loans rose only modestly.   
The behavior of the components of core  loans in recent months is broadly  
consistent with the results of the January SLOOS.  The su rvey responses indicate that, 
during the fourth quarter of 2010, modest ne t fractions of banks continued to ease 
5 According to flow of funds estimates, at the end of the third quarter, commercial banks held 
approximately one-fifth of outstanding home mortgages, and so the estimated increases in the portfolios of 
commercial banks do not imply growth in total mortga ge debt during the fourth quarter. See Federal 
Reserve Board, Statistical Release Z.1, “Flo w of Funds Accounts of the United States,”

standards for C&I loans, and larger net fractions reported having eased terms for such 
loans.  Changes in lending policies for other categories of lo ans were mixed and 
generally small.  Meanwhile, moderate ne t fractions of respondents indicated that 
demand for C&I loans had strengthened, and similar fractions reported that inquiries 
from business borrowers for new or increased  credit lines had picked up.  In contrast,

last month, while the contraction in small tim e deposits and retail money market mutual 
funds persisted.  The ongoing compositional shif t within M2 toward liquid deposits likely 
reflects their relatively higher yields compared with other components of M2.  The rise in 
currency stepped down in December to an annual rate of only about 3¾ percent, with part 
of the slowdown stemming from severe winter  weather that delayed shipments of new 
U.S. currency to Europe.  The monetary ba se increased at an annual rate of about 
25 percent in December, as the Desk’s purchases of Treasury securities boosted reserve 
balances

about ½ percentage point in the first half of 2010 and lowered the growth rate roughly ⅛ percentage point 
in the second half.

Appendix 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
The January  2011 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
indicated that, during the fourth quarter of 2010, a modest net fraction of banks continued to ease 
standards and terms for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans while banks reported small mixed 
changes in their lending policies for other types of loans.1  The survey also indicated a notable 
increase in the share of banks reporting strengthened demand for C&I loans.  Nevertheless, 
demand for most types of loans appeared to  remain subdued, and lending standards likely  
remained tight for many households and firms. 
Domestic survey respondents reported having eased standards and most terms on 
C&I loans to firms of all sizes, with a greater fraction of banks reporting having done so for large 
firms.2  These movements are consistent with a continued and gradua l unwinding of the 
widespread tightening in standards that occurred over the past few years.  Only  one bank (a large 
bank) reported tightening its standards somewhat .  In explaining the net easing, banks mainly  
credited increased competition from other banks and nonbank lenders; they also cited a more 
favorable or less uncertain economic outlook,  similar to the past three surveys.  
On the household side, the net fraction of banks that reported having tightened standards 
on nontraditional mortgage loans crept up for th e second consecutive quarter, while banks, on net, 
did not change standards on prime residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs).  Similarly, banks reported that chang es in standards and terms on consumer loans had 
been small and mixed, though a modest net fraction reported easing spreads on non-credit-card 
consumer loans, and banks again reported an in creased willingness to make consumer installment 
loans. 
The survey recorded a jump in the net fraction of banks reporting somewhat stronger 
demand for C&I loans, and the fraction of respondents reporting a pickup in inquiries from  
business borrowers for new or increased credit lin es also increased notably.  A smaller net 
fraction of banks reported that demand for commercial real estate (CRE) loans increased somewhat.  In contrast, respondents, on net, did not indicate much change in demand for 
1 The January 2010 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to 
businesses and households over the past three months.  The survey also included sets of special questions 
on factors affecting recent closed-end residential real  estate loan growth, on changes in commercial real 
estate loan terms over the past year, and on asset quality expectations for 2011.  This appendix is based on 
responses from 56 domestic banks and 22 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. Respondent banks received the survey on or after December 22, 2010, and responses were due by January 11, 2011.

more and small firms as those with annual sales of less than $50 million.

consumer loans, and a fair number reported that demand had weak ened somewhat for residential 
real estate loans. 
 A set of special questions asked respondents about asset quality expectations for 2011, 
assuming that economic 
activity progresses in line with  consensus forecasts.  Large net fractions 
of banks expected that credit quality would improve  in all major loan categories, especially when 
responses are weighted by  the amount of outstanding loans in that category at the respondent 
bank.  Notably, a majority of banks expected the credit quality  of commercial real estate (CRE)  
loans to improve somewhat despite ongoing wea kness in the fundamentals in that sector.  
Expectations for improvement in the quality  of residential real estate loans were subdued 
compared with expectations for other categories.   
Federal Reserve data indicate that banks in the aggregate have recently added to their 
holdings of closed-end residential real estate loan s.  In response to a special question regarding 
this increase, banks generally did not credit transito ry  factors, instead indicating that the rise was 
due primarily to the relative attractiveness of holding these loans in their portfolios and a pickup 
in originations of loans that are not elig ible for securitization via government-sponsored 
enterprises (GSEs).  
LENDING TO BUSINESS  
Questions on Commercial and Industrial Loans 
The survey indicated that th e market for C&I loans conti nued to thaw in the fourth  
quarter.  About 15 percent of banks reported ha ving eased standards on C&I loans to large and 
middle-market firms, with no banks reporting having tightened standards, and about 5 percent, on net, reported easing to small firms, about the same  as in the previous survey.  The banks that 
eased standards were almost all large banks.
3    
Positive net fractions of banks eased mo
st term s on C&I loans, with larger net fractions 
easing terms for loans to large and middle-market firms than for loans to small firms.  Somewhat more banks reported having reduced spreads of loan rates over their bank’s cost of funds than in the previous quarter, with about 50 percent of banks, on net, trimming spreads on loans to large 
and middle-market firms and 30 percent, on net, narrowing spreads on loans to small firms.  Somewhat smaller net fractions of banks lowe red the costs of credit lines and lengthened the  
maximum  maturity for loans to firms of all sizes.  The sizes of C&I credit lines and business 
credit card accounts were reportedly little changed,  continuing a period of stabilization after a 
series of cuts in such lines seen in surveys during the first half of 2010. 
Of banks that reported having eased standard s or terms, large majorities pointed to 
increased competition from other banks and nonbank  lenders, as well as a more favorable or less 
uncertain economic outlook, as reasons for the ch anges.  Between 25 percent and 30 percent of 
3 Large banks are defined as banks with assets  greater than or equal to $20 billion as of 
October 31, 2010, and other banks as those with assets of less than $20 billion.

respondents also cited reductions in defaults by  borrowers in the public debt market, increased 
tolerance for risk, and industry-specific improve ments, with three banks noting improvements in 
the auto supply industry. 
Reports of strengthened demand for C&I loans we re notably m ore widespread than in the 
previous survey.  About 30 percent of banks, on net, reported greater demand from large and 
middle-market firms, and about 10 percent repor ted strengthened demand from small firms.  In 
addition, compared with the October survey, a noticeably larger fraction of banks reported an increase in inquiries from  business borrowers for ne w or increased credit lines.  Of the banks 
reporting stronger demand, about 80 percent i ndicated that the increased demand was due to 
funding needs for merger and acquisition activity,  and more than half noted reduced borrowing 
from other banks or nonbank sources.  Somewhat less than half of the banks also noted increased financing needs for inventories, accounts receivable,  and investment in plant and equipment.  The 
reported increase in demand in this survey is consistent with the increase in banks’ C&I loan holdings during December, according to the Federa l Reserve’s weekly statistical release H.8, 
“Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks in the United States.” 
A few branches and agencies of foreign ba nks (foreign banks) reported having eased 
standards on C&I loans, while none of those institu tions tightened standards.  Foreign banks also 
reported a small net increase in demand and in inquir ies regarding lines of credit, in line with the 
previous quarter.   
Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending 
The January survey indicated some stabilization in CRE lending policies and a 
strengthening of demand for such loans.  Sta ndards on CRE loans appear to have stabilized 
(likely at a very stringent level, given the ti ghtening reported in recent surveys), with little net 
movement in domestic bank lending standards in this  survey or the previous survey.  However, a 
few foreign banks reported having tightened standards.  Roughly 25 percent of banks, on net, 
reported that they had reduced the sizes of lines of credit for commercial construction, about the 
same as in the previous quarter.  
A positive net fraction of domestic banks (about 15 percent) reported increased demand 
for CRE loans, the strongest reading since early  2006.  Foreign banks also reported that demand 
had strengthened on net.  These reports are consis tent with modest increases in commercial real 
estate sales over the second half of 2010.  
Special Question on Commercial Real Estate Terms 
The survey included a special question regard ing changes in terms on CRE loans over the 
past year (repeated annually since 2001). Domestic  banks reported that they generally tightened  
such terms over 2010, but the tightening was less wide spread than in 2009.  Moreover, in contrast 
to 2009, almost no banks reported having tight ened loan terms considerably  over the past 
12 months.  About 40 percent of banks, on net, tightened loan-to-value ratios, and moderately  
smaller fractions tightened debt service coverage  ratios and maximum loan sizes.  Spreads,

Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending 
Standards on prime closed-end residential real  estate loans were little changed, on net, 
over the fourth quarter.  In contrast, standards on nontraditional loans were tightened by about 
15 percent of banks, on net, a touch more than in the previous survey.  The net fraction of banks 
tightening standards on nontraditional loans has now increased a bit for two consecutive quarters, 
after having fallen to nearly zero during the first half of 2010.  Banks reported little net change in 
standards for, or the sizes of, HELOCs.  
Demand reportedly weakened somewhat, on net, for both prime and nontraditional 
closed-end loans as well as for HELOCs.  Reported demand for closed-end loans has now declined for two consecutive surveys after having increased dur ing parts of 2009 and 2010. 
Special Question on Factors Affecting the Recent Increase in 
Residential Real Estate Loans  
A special question asked respondents about factors affecting the recent increase in 
closed-end residential real estate loan holdings.  According to the H.8 statistical release, banks’  
aggregate holdings of closed-end residential r eal estate loans increased steadily over the second 
half of 2010, despite standards for residential mortgages being little changed over the past six 
months, and despite the reported net decrease in demand.  About 45 percent of the respondents 
indicated that they had experienced growth in r esidential mortgage portfolios over that period. 
The majority  of banks that reco rded such increases noted the rela tive attractiveness of these loans 
compared with other assets and reported having b ecome more willing to expand their overall 
balance sheets via this category of loans.  About  one-third of these banks also reported having 
originated an increased volume of loans that we re not eligible for securitization through GSEs.  
 Banks were somewhat less likely to credit their accumulations of closed-end residential 
mortgages to transitory factor s such as capacity constraints in securitizing loans or reduced 
charge-offs or paydowns.  Moreover, only two banks (neither of which was among the very  
largest banks) attributed their loan accumulations to repurchases from the GSEs or other 
securitization pools.  
Questions on Consumer Lending 
Only a small net fraction of banks reporte d having eased standards on consumer credit 
card and non-credit-card loans in the fourth quarter , consistent with the past two surveys.   
Indeed, a modest net fraction of banks, about 10 percent, reported cutting back the sizes of consumer credit card lines.

Banks reported little change, on net, in  most terms on consumer loans, with the exception 
of spreads on non-credit-card loans and minimum  credit scores on credit card loans, which were 
eased by a modest net fraction of banks. The easing of terms on non-credit-card loans is 
consistent with the still elevated fraction of banks that reported an increased willingness to make consumer installment loans.  Banks were somewhat split regarding changes in demand for 
consumer loans, but on net  they reported little change.  
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON ASSET QUALITY EXPECTATIONS  
Large net fractions of banks expected impr ovements in delinquency and charge-off rates 
during 2011 in every major loan category, assu ming that economic activity progresses in line 
with consensus forecasts.  This special question has been asked once each  year during the past 
four years, and expectations for improvement are more widespread in this survey than any  prior 
survey, consistent with the apparent peak in  delinquency and charge-off rates in most loan 
categories during 2010.   
Banks were least likely to expect improvement  in the quality  of residential real estate 
loans.  Only about 25 percent of banks, on net, expected improvement in nontraditional closed-
end loans, and only about  35 percent of banks expected improvement in HELOCs.  Almost 
45 percent expected improvement for prime closed-e nd loans.  Large banks were somewhat more 
likely than small banks to expect improvement in  the quality  of residential real estate loans.  
About 50 percent of banks, on net, expected improvement this year in the quality of 
consumer loans, including both credit card loans and other loans.  Similarly, about 55 percent of 
banks expected improvement in the quality of CRE loans, with large banks more likely  to expect 
improvement.  These expectations are somewhat notab le in their contrast to the weakness in CRE 
fundamentals. 
In contrast, about 85 percent of banks expected an improvement in the quality of C&I 
loans to large and middle-market firms, and a bout 75 percent expected improvement for such 
loans to small firms over the coming year.  Th e fraction expecting substantial improvement on 
loans to large and middle-market firms was about 10 percent, the most in any loan category, and 
no bank expected deterioration in C&I loan quality  on loans to firms of any size.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY    
The strengthening of final domestic demand late last  year has reduced some of the  
downside risk to our projection that seemed so prominent only a few months ago.  As a  
result, we now judge the  risks to our projection for real activity as roughly balanced.  
That said, we continue to see the risks around our  projection for activity as  elevated 
relative to the average experience of the past 20  years (the benchmark used by the 
Committee).  The depth and duration of the recession as well as the severe financial crisis  
that precipitated the downturn were large  and historically unusual.  These  factors  
compound the difficulty  of identifying the  roles of supply and demand in generating the  
contraction, and hence the difficulty of assessing the strength of the expansion.  
Moreover, the pace at which credit availability will improve is difficult to determine.   
While recent indications suggest that lending conditions are gradually improving along  
the lines anticipa ted by the staff, the  risks to the outlook for credit supply remain sizable  
(in both directions), reflecting the  complicated interplay among the quality  of assets held  
by financial institutions, continued uncertainty  regarding mortgage- related  assets and  
mortgage documentation problems, and the effects of regulatory  reforms on lending  
decisions over the next several  years.  Finally, we see outsized risks to the outlook for the  
global outlook—to the downside in Europe, where concerns over  fiscal sustainabili ty in  
several  countries remain considerable, and to the  upside in emerging market economies, 
where  activity  could be  much stronger than we now expect. 
For a variety of  re asons, we continue to see the risks around our inflation 
projection as elevated relati ve to the experience of the past 20 years.  Underlying  
inflation has moved down to a very low level.  The shocks  generating the pronounced 
contraction in labor  and product markets were  exceptionally large  and unusual in 
character.  The federal funds rate i s effectively at the zero lower bound, limiting the  
scope for  future actions.  The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has expanded dramatically.
Future prospects for the  dollar and hence import  prices remain uncertain.  Finally, fiscal  
policy is judged by many observers to be on an unsustainable path.  Weighing these  risks  
to both the upside and downside, we continue to see the risks around our inflation projection as roughly balanced.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS   
To illustrate some of the  risks to the outlook, we  consider several alternatives to  
the baseline projection using simulations of staff  models.  In the  first scenario, we explore  
the possibility that incoming data signal  a more pronounced acceleration in economic  
activity than that embedded in the staff pro jection.   In the second scenario, a more robust  
expansion is accompanied by a pronounced rise in inflation expectations and higher  
commodity prices, thereby  sparking a   marked increase in both actual inflation and 
nominal interest rates.  We then turn to a downside risk for real activity— namely, that  
demand for housing and commercial properties will weaken further, leading to another  
round of sizable declines  in property prices  and spending on new construction.  The  
fourth scenario expands on this possibilit y by  assuming that an intensified  real estate 
slump would have important spillover effects on financial markets, credit supply, and 
confidence.  In the fifth scenario, we present the implications of a more pronounced disinflation, similar to that predicted  by some of the staff’s  reduced -form  models.  The  
final two scenarios consider contrasting risks to the global outlook—specifically, the possibility that ongoing fiscal and financial difficulties spark a recession in Europe, and the chance that emerging market economies  expand more vigorously than we anticipate  
and put further upward pressure on oil prices.  
In the  alternative scenarios, monetary policy responds to movements in real  
activity and inflation as prescribed by  a simple policy rule for the federal  funds rate, 
while nontraditional policy is assumed to follow the baseline path.  We  generate the  first  
five scenarios using the  FRB/US model and an estimated policy  rule.  The last two 
scenarios are  generated using the multicountry SIGMA model, which uses  a different  
policy rule  for the  federal funds rate that employs  an alternative  concept of  resource  
utilization.

Stronger Expansion  
Overall, we interpret recent indicators as consistent with a gradual strengthening  
in real activity this  year  and next.  Bu t some of the incoming data were appreciably  
stronger than we expected, and in this scenario we consider the risk that a  more robust  
1 For FRB/US, the federal funds rate follows the “outcome -based” rule, described in the appendix 
on policy rules in Book B.  In the case of SIGMA, its rule is broadly similar but uses a measure of slack 
equal to the difference between actual output and the model ’s estimate of the level of output that would 
occur in the absence of a slow adjustment in wages and prices.

expansion is under way, spurred by a mutually reinforcing dynamic of improved 
optimism, higher spending, greater hiring, and increasing  credit availability.  The 
stronger activity and improved optimism buoy financial markets and push equity prices  
about 12 percent above baseline by the end of this year.  This virtuous circle causes  real  
GDP to expand 4½ percent in 2011 and 5½ percent in 2012, bringing the unemployment  
rate down to 7 percent by late 2012—a rebound in activity more in line with previous  
recoveries from  a deep recession.  With less slack, inflation is higher; however, the  
upward pressure on prices is partially checked by  more capital deepening, and thus by  
larger productivity  gains, which hold down unit labor costs.  Under these conditions, the  
federal funds rate rises to ¾ percent by the  end of  2011 and remains above  baseline  
thereafter.  
Higher Inflation  
A faster  economic recovery would  generate larger price effects if it raised  
inflation expectations markedly, possibly because  of concerns about whether the Federal  
Reserve would tighten policy quickly enough in response to emerging inflation pressures.  
Moreover, r ising prices for oil and other commodities could increase inflationary  
pressures somewhat further if a robust domestic  expansion was accompanied by a  
stronger  global economy.  Relative to the previous scenario, this one features higher  
inflation expectatio ns as well as stronger domestic and foreign  activity.  As  a result, core 
PCE inflation rises above 2 percent in 2012 and to almost 3 percent by the  middle of the  
decade.  With inflation moving up quickly, real GDP persistently expanding at  a pace  
well abov e its potential, and the unemployment rate falling r  apidly back to the NAIRU, 
the federal funds rate begins to rise in the middle of this  year and  reaches as high as  
6¾ percent in 2014.  As investors seek protection against higher expected inflation and respond to the anticipated tightening in monetary  policy, long- term interest rates rise  
much sooner and by substantially more than in the baseline, causing the 10- year Treasury 
rate to reach 6¾   percent by the  end of 2014.   
Intensified Real Estate Slump  
In  the baseline projection, conditions in the real estate sector improve  a bit this  
year and next, as a recovery in homebuilding slowly  gets under way, house prices fall  
only modestly, and nonresidential construction stabilizes.  However, a large volume of  
home foreclosures, elevated inventories of unsold homes, high office and commercial  
vacancy rates,  and restrictive credit conditions may  restrain construction activity by more

than we expect.   In this scenario, we assume that the slump in the real estate sector 
intensifies.  Specifically, house prices decline an additional 12 percent from the baseline  
by the  end of 2012, a development that not only discourages potential homebuyers and 
causes housing starts to remain at their current levels, but also damps the recovery in 
consumer spending by reducing household net worth.  In addition, nonresidential  
construction falls a further 17 percent.  Under the  assumption that these adverse  
developments would not generate substantial spillovers in the financial sector, r eal GDP  
rises 3½  percent per  year on average from 2011 through 2013.  As a result, the  
unemployment rate declines very  gradually and is still close to 8  percent by  the  end of  
2013—1 percentage point above the baseline.  With greater slack, inflation remains close to 1 percent through the  middle of the decade.  These weak conditions push the liftoff of  
the federal funds rate to late 2013.  
Intensified Real Estate Slump with Spillovers 
A further deterioration of conditions in the real estate sector might entai l 
significant losses for many financial institutions, renewing concerns about the adequacy  
of banking-sector capital  and causing credit terms  and conditions for households and 
businesses to tighten; such developments might also make the  general economic outlook 
more uncertain.  This scenario builds on the previous one by  assuming that falling real  
estate prices and related factors lead to major  credit losses, reduced  credit availability,  
and higher risk premiums.  In addition, heightened uncertainty damages  the confidence of  
firms and households, causing them to delay their  purchases of business capital and 
consumer durables.  On balance, real GDP rises only 2½ percent, on average, in 2011 and 2012.  As a result, the unemployment rate remains close to 9 percent until 2014—a full percentage point above  what would occur in the absence of spillover effects—putting  
additional downward pressure on inflation.  In response, the federal funds  rate remains  
near zero until mid -2014. 
Further Disinflation  
In the baseline, inflation remains relatively stable  over the next two years and then 
begins to rise  as unemployment declines in an environment of well-anchored inflation 
expectations.  But the stability of various measures of expected inflation to date may be  
misleading  us about the potential for further disinflation in a persistently weak economy.  
In this scenario, actual inflation falls below zero by  2013 and remains negative  
thereafter —a decline that is in line with the predictions of some of our forecasting

equations that do not condition on survey measures of expected inflation.  In addition, 
investors become less certain about the course of future inflation.  As a result, bond 
premiums rise and put upward pressure on real long- term interest rates, thereby modestly  
damping spending and boosting unemployment relative to baseline over the next few  
years.  In response to lower inflation and greater economic slack, the federal funds rate  
remains at its effective lower bound until early 2014.  In the longer run, monetary policy  
is sufficiently stimulative to bring the unemployment rate eventually below baseline and  
to check the deflationary  pressure.  
Severe European Recession   
In light of the risks posed by fiscal and financial problems in Europe, this  scenario  
incorporates  a large rise in European sovereign and private  yields  relative to the baseline 
projection and a substantial fall in the euro.  Specifically, the scenario assumes that an  
intensification of  problems in European financial markets spill s over to financial markets  
in the United States and in our major non-European trading partners.  In addition, European sovereign spreads rise 150 basis points by early next  year relative to baseline, 
investment- grade corporate bond spreads in Europe rise about  twice as much , and 
European real GDP falls more than 5 percent relative to baseline next  year  despite a 
depreciation of the euro of  more than  20 percent  against the dollar.  U.S. net exports are  
adversely  affected by the stronger dollar and  weaker foreign  activity,  and d omestic  
demand is restrained by a 50 basis point rise in U.S. investment- grade corporate bond 
spreads, a  weaker stock market, and reduced confidence.  Altogether, U.S. real GDP  rises 
just 2½ percent in 2011 and 3½ percent in 2012, and the unemployment rate  remains  
above 9 percent through mid 2012.  The greater resource slack, coupled with lower  
import prices, pushes PCE inflation down to about ½ percent in 2011 and 2012.  The  
federal funds rate lifts off later and stays lower than in the baseline.  
Foreign Boom with Higher Oil Prices  
We project that real activity in the emerging market economies (EMEs)  will 
expand about 5 percent.  In this scenario, the EMEs expand more rapidly than under our  
baseline in response to faster- than-expected growth in domestic demand that is partly  
fueled by robust productivity  growth.  The stronger global  demand, which  we assume 
will fall disproportionately  on oil-intensive products (such as automobiles), leads to a 
substantial rise in the price of oil.  All told, aggregate foreig n  GDP rises 2½  percent

above baseline by the end of 2012, and oil prices  rise 30 percent above baseline—to 
about $120 per barrel.  In the near term, the expansion of foreign activity and an 
associated depreciation of the dollar boost U.S. real net exports, lifting the increase  in 
U.S. real GDP to about 4¼ percent in 2011.  U.S. core inflation is about ¼ percentage 
point above baseline due  to a combination of stronger U.S. activity, dollar depreciation, 
and higher oil prices; headline inflation is nearly  ¾ percentage point above baseline.   By  
2013, U.S. GDP growth falls below baseline because of monetary policy tightening, 
which starts earlier than in the baseline,  and higher oil prices, which exert some drag on 
potential GDP.   
OUTSIDE FORECASTS   
The Blue Chi p consensus forecast for real GDP released in early January showed  
a marked improvement in participants’ expectations for economic activity this  year.  The 
consensus projection now anticipates a 3.3 percent increase in real GDP over the four  
quarters of 2011, 0.4 percentage point higher than reported in the December survey; real  
GDP is expected to advance at a similar pace in 2012.  While the Blue Chip consensus  
for real GDP  growth is weaker than the staff outlook through 2012, survey  participants  
indicated  that they saw notable upside risks to the outlook for real activity.  Similarly, the  
Blue Chip forecast for the unemployment rate  at the end of 2012 is 8.4 percent, about  
½ percentage point higher than the staff projection.  Regarding inflation, the Blue Chip 
consensus anticipates the total CPI increasing 1.8 percent over the four quarters of 2011 and 2.0 percent in 2012, little changed from its projection from a month earlier and higher than the staff forecasts of 1.5 percent in 2011 and 0.9 percent in 2012.  The Blue  
Chip forecast for short -term interest rates shows  a  more pronounced increase in 2012 
than assumed by the staff, while the Blue Chip path for long- term interest rates is broadly  
similar to the staff projection.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
NAIRU. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The annual FI estimates are on a calendar year basis. Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.
