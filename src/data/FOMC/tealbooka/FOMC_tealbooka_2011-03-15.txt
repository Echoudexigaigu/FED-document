Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received since the time of the January Tealbook 
suggests that the economic recovery has continued to proceed at a moderate pace.  
Although the rise in real GDP in the fourth quarter was a bout ½ percentage point less 
than the previous Tealbook forecast and consumer spending in January came in below 
our expectations, the limited information that we have for February has thus far been 
more encouraging.  Moreover, forward-looki ng signals of activity in coming months 
point to solid growth, much along the lines of what we anticipated in the January 
Tealbook.  In particular, the latest indicators of factory output and business equipment 
spending have remained upbeat, motor vehicle sales picked up noticeably in February, 
and readings from the labor market have been  stronger, on net, than  we had anticipated.  
In all, the incoming data appear consistent with real GDP increasi ng at an annual rate 
averaging 3½ percent in the firs t half of this year, just slig htly below our forecast in the 
January Tealbook. 
The trajectory of our medium-term forecast is also quite similar to that in the 
previous Tealbook.  While equity prices are somewhat higher in this projection and the 
exchange value of the dollar a little lowe r, these positive influences on activity are 
essentially offset by higher oil prices a nd slightly more-restrictive fiscal policy 
assumptions.  As a result, we continue to project that the pace of real GDP growth will step up to 3¾ percent in 2011 and to 4½ percen t in 2012.  As has been true in previous 
projections, economic activity this year a nd next should be supported by accommodative 
monetary policy, increasing credit availability, and rising household and business 
confidence.  Meanwhile, we have taken on board the appreciable decline in the 
unemployment rate in recent m onths, putting the projected jobless rate at 8½ percent at 
the end of this year and 7½ percent at th e end of 2012, several tenths below our forecast 
in the January Tealbook.     
In response to the narrower margin of resource slack in this projection and a 
higher path of energy and impor t prices, we have marked up our projection for inflation 
relative to the January Tealbook.  In particular, we have boosted our forecast for core 
PCE inflation by ¼ percentage point to 1¼ percent in both 2011 and 2012.  Given our projections for the continued pass-through of near-term comm odity price increases into

consumer food and energy prices this year, overall PCE prices are projected to rise 
almost 2 percent in 2011 but to then decelerate to a roughly 1 percent increase in 2012. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
We now assume that the FOMC will raise the target federal funds rate above the 
current range of 0 to ¼ percent in the thir d quarter of 2012—two quart ers earlier than we 
assumed in the January Tealbook—and that the rate will average ½ pe rcent in the fourth 
quarter of 2012.  This revision in the liftoff date keeps our policy assumption broadly in 
line with the prescriptions of the outcome-based policy rule that is used to set monetary  
policy in the long-run economic outlook.  Re garding nonconventiona l monetary policy, 
we have retained our assumption that the Federal Reserve will expand its holdings of 
longer-term Treasury securities through the second quarter of 2011, thus completing the 
$600 billion increment to the si ze of the portfolio that was announced last fall.  We  
continue to assume that when the FOMC first ra ises its target for the federal funds rate, it 
will stop reinvesting principal payments  from its securities holdings.  
Financial Conditions   
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities has increased about 15 basis points since 
mid-January, and we have slightly raised the pr ojected level of this yield in the near and 
medium term.  As in recent projections, we anticipate that the 10-year Treasury yield will 
increase nearly 1 percentage point by the end of 2012.  The movement of the valuation 
window through the projected period of near-zero short-term interest rates continues to be the primary factor contributing to the rise in yields.  Since the January Tealbook, yields 
on investment-grade corporate bonds and in terest rates on conforming fixed-rate 
mortgages have increased about in line with Treasury yields.  With  current spreads little 
changed, we have not altered our  path of projected spreads. 
The Dow Jones U.S. Stock Market Index is almost 2 percent above the level 
anticipated in the January Tealbook.  Through mi d-February, stock prices registered an 
even larger gain, but share prices have  moved down recently because of mounting 
concerns about the economic consequences of political unrest in the Middle East and 
North Africa.  The equity premium has rema ined well above longer-run norms, and, over 
the projection period, we expect  it to decline gradually towa rd a more typical level.

Thus, we expect stock prices to  increase at an annual rate of about 10 percent through the 
end of 2012. 
According to the latest readings from  CoreLogic, home prices continued to 
decrease through January.  However, the da
ta now show a somewhat smaller drop in 
recent months than we had anticipated, and we have marked up the level of home prices 
in the first quarter of this year by 2 percent relative to the January Tealbook.  
Nonetheless, the incoming data continue to  suggest that the h ousing market remains 
weak, and we did not materially revise our outlook for changes in home prices over the 
medium term.  We expect the CoreLogic rep eat sales index to decline 3½ percent in 2011 
and to be unchanged in 2012.   
Fiscal Policy   
Our fiscal policy assumptions are slightly more restrictive in this projection.  In 
particular, we now assume that nominal appr opriations for federal discretionary spending 
will turn down in fiscal years 2011 and 2012, whereas we previously assumed that they would be about flat.
1   We continue to expect that fe deral fiscal policy actions will be a 
roughly neutral influence on aggregate demand in 2011 as the impetus from the one-year 
cut in payroll taxes and from the full expe nsing allowance for business investment is 
essentially offset by some reduction in stim ulus-related grants  to state and local 
governments.  In 2012, however, federal fiscal actions are expected to impose a drag of 
about 1 percent of GDP as real purchases decline, the payroll tax cuts lapse, the 
Emergency Unemployment Compensation program  is phased out, the stimulus grants for 
states and localities are essentially exhaus ted, and the expensing provision for business 
investment is scaled back. 
As in the January projection, we expect  the budget deficit to reach $1.4 trillion 
(about 9 percent of GDP) in fiscal 2011 and then narrow to $1.1 tr illion in fiscal 2012 
(around 7 percent of GDP), primarily reflecting the further tapering off of stimulus-related policies and the higher revenues a ssociated with a faster pace of economic 
1 The Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal 2011 would raise discretionary budget authority 
by $30 billion above the fiscal 2 010 level, but a recently passed House bill would cut it by about 
$60 billion. We are now assuming a cut in total discretionary appropriations of $15 billion for fiscal 2011, 
about halfway between the two proposals, and a cut in funding of about $30 billion in 2012, both relative to 
the fiscal 2010 level.  It is worth noting that budget proposals are often portrayed under a variety of 
baselines, making them hard to compare.

activity.  Correspondingly, federal debt is projected to rise to over 70 percent of GDP at 
the end of fiscal 2012.  
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Incoming data on economic activity in the foreign economies have been 
somewhat more upbeat than we anticipated in  January.  Foreign real GDP expanded at a 
3¼ percent pace in the fourth quarter and will  likely exceed that  pace in the current 
quarter.  Going forward, we see foreign GDP increasing about 3½ percent this year and 
next, propelled by continuing robust growth in the emerging market economies and some 
firming of activity in the advanced foreign ec onomies.  This outlook, however, is slightly 
weaker than in the January forecast because of the greater headwinds arising from the 
sharp rise in world oil prices.   
The foreign exchange value of the dolla r in real terms is currently about 
1¼ percent lower than we had projected at th e time of the January forecast.  From this 
lower starting point, we assume that the dollar will depreciate at an annual rate of about 
3½ percent over the forecast period, a pace a bout unchanged from what we had written 
down in January.   
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
Recent developments in the Middle East and North Africa have pushed oil prices 
sharply higher.  At present, the main disr uption to oil producti on has been in Libya, 
where an estimated 1.2 million barrels per day of productive capacity have been shut in.  Saudi Arabia has reportedly increased its oi l output, though it is not clear how much of 
the Libyan shortfall it is curre ntly replacing.  (For details , see the box “Economic Risks 
from the Middle East and North Africa” in th e International Economic Developments and 
Outlook section.)  In response to these developments, the spot price of West Texas 
Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has climbed more than $13 per barrel since the time of the 
January Tealbook, closing on March 8 at $105 per ba rrel.  Prices for de livery later in the 
projection period have also move d up, but not as much as spot and very near-term futures 
prices.  Consistent with futures prices, we now project that the spot price of WTI will end 
2012 at about $104 per barrel, roughly $8 highe r than at the time of the previous 
Tealbook.  
Nonfuel commodity prices have continue d to move up sharply, increasing about 
6 percent on average since the January Teal book.  Prices of a range of food commodities

have increased, reflecting continued st rong demand combined with tight supply 
conditions.  (For additional de tail, see the box “Food Prices a nd Foreign Inflation” in the 
International Economic Developments and Outlo ok section.)  Metals prices have also 
increased on the strength of global demand, especially from the manufacturing sector.  
We project that commodity pr ices for both food and metals will flatten out near their 
current elevated levels, consistent  with quotes in futures markets. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
We expect real GDP to rise at an annual  rate of 3¼ percent in  the current quarter, 
the same pace as in the fourth quarter.  Although consumer spending appears to have  
decelerated this quarter and construction sp ending remains weak, business outlays for 
equipment and software (E&S) look to be on track for a robust gain.  In the second 
quarter, we expect real GDP to  accelerate to a 3¾ percent pace as increases in consumer 
spending pick back up and business fixed investment continues to rise briskly.   
Labor Markets   
The labor market recovery seems to be gaining strength.  Priv ate nonfarm payrolls 
jumped 222,000 in February after having incr eased an estimated 68,000 in January.  The 
swing from January to February was likely exaggerated by widespread snowstorms that 
held down employment during the January surv ey reference week, but, on the whole, the 
employment data received since the previous Tealbook have been a bit stronger than 
expected, with the cumulative gains in priv ate payroll employment since November about 
50,000 higher than in the January forecast.  
Readings from the household survey have also been encouraging.  In January, the 
unemployment rate fell 0.4 per centage point for a second month, and it ticked down an 
additional 0.1 percentage point , to 8.9 percent, in February.  The sharp drop in the 
unemployment rate since November has been  surprising, but we are nonetheless viewing 
it as further evidence of a strengthening labor market.2  In addition, the share of workers 
employed part time for economic reasons d eclined by ½ percenta ge point over this 
period, to 6 percent.  That sa id, not all of the news has been good:  The labor force 
participation rate has held steady in recent m onths at a level that we judge to be well 
2 As described later in this document, we have interpreted some of the movements in the 
unemployment and labor force participation rates as sugge sting that the rate of potential output growth has 
been somewhat lower than we had assumed previously.

below even its declining trend, and long-te rm unemployment remains extremely high.  
(See the box “The Labor Force Particip ation Rate” for further discussion.) 
Other labor market indicators point to a continued pickup in payrolls.  Weekly 
initial claims for unem
ployment insura nce have moved below the 400,000 mark, and 
hiring measures—such as the help wanted index and the NFIB index of hiring plans— 
have improved noticeably in recent months .  Moreover, individuals’ outlooks on labor 
market conditions have become more favorable , as is evident from the greater optimism 
about future labor market conditions expre ssed by respondents to the Thomson Reuters/ 
Michigan survey.  
In light of these improvements, we ha ve strengthened slightly our near-term  
projection for the labor market.  We now look for private payro lls to rise 200,000 in 
March, and about 220,000 per month, on averag e, in the second quarter, both about 
10,000 above the January Tealbook forecast.  In  addition, we expect the unemployment 
rate to remain at 8.9 percent over the next  several months, about 0.5 percentage point 
below the level we had expected as of  the time of the January forecast.  
The Industrial Sector 
Following a strong rise in December, industrial production (IP) edged down in 
January, as the output of mines and utilities declined and the rate of increase in 
manufacturing output was limited somewhat by heavy snowfalls.  In the motor vehicle 
sector, production rose in January but was restrained, in part, by some temporary 
bottlenecks in the supply chain.  Nonethele ss, with assembly schedules calling for 
production to rise sharply this quarter and next, we expect the production of motor 
vehicles and parts to increase more than 20 per cent at an annual rate over the first half of 
this year.  Outside of motor vehicles, la st month’s reading on production-worker hours 
and the available weekly physical product data suggest that output in  the factory sector 
expanded at a robust pace in February, and the positive readings from the new orders 
diffusion indexes in the nati onal and regional manufacturing surveys imply further solid 
production gains in coming months.  In total, we now expect industria l production to rise 
at an annual rate of 6 percent over the first half of the year—a  bit faster than projected in 
the January Tealbook.

Household Spending 
The recovery in consumer spending appear s to be proceeding at a moderate pace. 
Although retail sales in January were consider ably weaker than we were expecting, it 
seems likely that unseasonably poor weathe r across much of the country was an 
important factor holding down spending that  month, and we expect to see a bounceback 
in February.  In this regard, sales of new au tos and light trucks jumped to an annual rate 
of 13.4 million units last month, an increase of 800,000 units from January's reading.  We 
continue to expect the pace of other (non-auto ) real spending to pick up in the next few 
months, as ongoing improvements in the labo r market and the boost to disposable 
incomes arising from the temporary reductions in  payroll taxes this year more than offset 
the drag from higher energy prices.  In addition, the latest readings on consumer 
sentiment have improved a bit further in recent  months.  All told, we expect real PCE to 
rise at an annual rate of 3 pe rcent in the first half of this  year, about ¼ percentage point 
below our projection in the January Tealbook. 
Restrained by weak demand and a considerable overhang of vacant homes for 
sale, residential construction remains depresse d.  Single-family housing starts and permits 
have changed little since last summer, and single-family new home sales have been 
moribund over this period.  However, with job growth gradually strengthening and 
housing quite affordable, we expect demand for new homes to creep up over the near 
term and for starts to rise slowly.  Increases in activity should be more noticeable in the 
multifamily sector, where starts moved higher in January and where vacancy rates have  
been trending down.  In all, our forecast calls for residential investment to rise at annual 
rates of about 4 percent in the first quarter and 7 percen t in the second. 
Business Investment 
After increasing at an estimated annual ra te of about 7 percent in the fourth 
quarter, real business investme nt in E&S is projected to resume double-digit growth in 
the first half of this year.  Outlays in the f ourth quarter were held down by a large drop in 
business purchases of transportation equipment,  but we expect spending in this volatile 
category to rebound this quarter.  Meanwhile, outside the transportati on sector, the orders 
backlog for nondefense capital good s excluding aircraft has con tinued to rise in recent 
months, pointing to additional so lid increases in shipments in coming months.  The latest 
readings on business sentiment are also cons istent with robust near-term gains in E&S 
outlays, and credit conditions have generall y continued to improve.  As a result, we

The  Labor  Force  Participation   Rate  
The  labor  force  participation   rate  (the  black  line  in  the  figure  on  the  
facing  page)  has  fallen  sharply  since  the  onset  of  the  recent  recession.    In  
part,  the  nearly  2  percentage  point  decline  over  this  period  reflects  
cyclical  factors.   The  decline  also  reflects  the  influence   of  a  downward   
underlying   trend  in  participation,   an  estimate   of  which   is  shown  as  the  
solid  red  line  in  the  figure.     
For  the  past  10  years,  the  dominant   force  behind  the  downward   trend  in  
participation   has  been  the  aging  of  the  population,   a  process  that  we  
expect  will  continue   to  push  the  trend  lower  for  the  next  two  decades.   
To  illustrate  this  effect,  the  dashed  red  line  in  the  figure  holds  the  
participation   rate  of  each  age  group  constant  at  its  1996  level,  while  
allowing  the  share  of  each  age  group  in  the  population  to  evolve  as  it  has  
in  the  data.   This  line  has  fallen  substantially   since  2001,  reflecting   the  
increasing   share  in  the  population   of  persons  aged  55  and  over,   who  are  
less  likely  to  participate   in  the  labor   market  than  their  younger  
counterparts.    Of  course,  secular  changes  in  participation   rates  within  
age  groups—which   cause  the  solid  red  trend  line  to  differ  from  the  
dashed  red  line  that  isolates  the  aging  effects—can  be  significant   as  well;  
notably,  the  influx  of  women  into  the  workforce  was  the  primary  
development  accounting   for  the  steep  increase  in  participation   during  
the  1970s  and  1980s.   However,  these  types  of  movements   have  not  
been  large,  on  balance,  over  the  past  two  decades.    
Cyclical  factors  also  have  influenced   the  participation   rate  substanti ally  
over  the  past  few  years.   Probably   the  most  important   of  these  factors  
has  been  the  deterioration   in  job  prospects,  which   has  likely  caused  
many  individuals   to  leave  or  refrain  from  entering  the  labor  force.    This  
influence   was  likely  offset  in  part  by  the  availability   since  mid‐ 2008  of  
extended   and  emergency   unemployment   insurance   benefits  and  by  the  
drop  in  household   wealth,  both  of  which  have  raised  the  value  or  
necessity   of  participation.     
As  noted  previously,   we  expect  the  participation   rate  to  move  up  toward  
its  declining   trend  in  the  coming  years  as  improving   job  prospects   draw  
more  people  into  the  labor  force—a  development  only  partially  offset  by

forecast  for  a  moderate   recovery  in  economic   activity  more  broadly,  we  
expect   that  a  considerable   amount  of  time  will  pass  before  the  
participation   rate  returns  to  its  trend.   All  told,  we  project  the  
participation   rate  to  end  2012  at  about  64½  percent,  still  roughly  
¼  percentage   point  below  our  estimate  of  the  trend  and  only  
¼  percentage   point  above  its  current  level.      
Our  projection   for  labor  force   participation   has  both  upside  and  
downside  risks.   Nonetheless,   given   the  profound   changes  in  the  age  
distribution   of  the  population   currently   under  way,  we  consider  it  very  
unlikely  that  the  participation   rate  will  return  to  its  pre‐recession   levels.

expect real E&S spending to post annualized in creases of almost 13 percent over the first 
two quarters of this year, not much diffe rent from our January Tealbook forecast. 
Despite some quarterly fluctuati ons in spending, business outlays on 
nonresidential structures continue to tre nd downward.  Spending rose in the fourth 
quarter, but this rise was larg ely the result of a temporary ramp-up in outlays for power-
generating structures in antic ipation of the year-end expiration of a renewable-energy tax 
incentive; data through January suggest that such spending is dropping off sharply this 
quarter, while investment in other types of bu ildings has continued to decline.  Looking 
forward, recent readings on architectural b illings, which are a useful indicator of 
spending several months out, suggest that spending will flatten around the middle of the 
year.  Meanwhile, elevated energy prices shou ld sustain sizable increases in expenditures 
on drilling and mining structures in coming months.  Altogether, we expect investment in 
nonresidential structures to fall at an annual rate of 10 percent in the first quarter but to be 
about flat in the second. 
The limited data we have on hand suggest that real nonfarm  inventory investment 
turned up again in the first quarter follow ing an abrupt fourth-quarter pause that 
subtracted 3½ percentage points from real GDP growth.  Af ter a sizable drawdown in the 
fourth quarter, stocks of light motor vehicl es edged up, on net, in January and February, 
and manufacturers’ assembly plans are consistent with further increases in coming 
months.  Outside of motor vehicles, the available book-value data and indicators of 
manufacturing activity also suggest that the pace of stockbuilding has stepped back up.  
Overall, inventories appear fa irly well aligned with sales:   The staff’s flow of goods 
system shows only a handful of sectors wher e inventories appear elevated (construction 
materials, chemicals, and primary metals), a nd motor vehicle stocks appear quite lean.  
All told, we expect nonfarm inventory inve stment to boost real GDP growth in the 
current quarter by about 1 percenta ge point at an annual rate and to be close to neutral in 
the second quarter.   
Government 
Real federal purchases were about uncha nged in the fourth quarter of 2010, as a 
decline in defense purchases was offset by an increase in nondefense purchases.  
Available information on defense spending sugg ests a moderate decline in real federal 
purchases this quarter.  Howe ver, we expect real purch ases to rebound in the second 
quarter, as defense spending returns to a level more consistent with past appropriations.

News from the state and local sector ha s been more downbeat than expected.  
Real state and local purchases fe ll at an annual rate of 2½ per cent in the fourth quarter of 
last year, a significantly steep er decline than projected in the January Tealbook.  The 
decline primarily reflected a 10 percent re duction in real construction expenditures, 
although a further trimming of payrolls in this  sector was also a factor.  The available 
information on construction spending and em ployment points to another sizable drop in 
expenditures in the current quarter, and, in response, we have also marked down our 
forecast for the second quarter.  As a result, we now project real st ate and local spending 
to decline at an annual rate of about 1½ percen t over the first half of  2011; in the January 
Tealbook, we had expected spending to be about flat over this period. 
Foreign Trade 
Supported by solid foreign economic growth, real exports of goods and services 
are projected to increase at an annual rate of about 11 percent in th e first half of 2011.  
This projection for exports is above that in the January Tealbook, reflecting the lower 
level of the dollar and recent indicators that suggest st ronger foreign real activity. 
We expect imports to bounce back after th eir sharp decline in the fourth quarter 
and to expand at an 8 percent rate in the firs t half of the year, in line with the continuing  
recovery of economic activity in the United Stat es.  This projection is  a touch softer than 
in our previous forecast, owing largely to the lower near-term pace of U.S. real GDP 
growth and to our reaction to the trade data for December. 
All told, we expect net exports to add about ¼ percen tage point to U.S. GDP 
growth in the first quarter a nd to turn neutral in  the second quarter.  These projections 
have been revised up a little over ¼ percentage point on av erage, reflecting the upward 
revisions to exports and downw ard revisions to imports.   
Prices and Wages 
After increasing at an annual rate of 1¾ pe rcent in the fourth quarter of 2010, total 
PCE prices are projected to increase 3¼ percent in the first quarter of this year before 
stepping back down to a 2¼ percent pace in the second.  Sharp increases in consumer 
energy prices boosted inflation last quarter, and we project even larger increases in 
energy prices this quarter.  In addition, we expect the recent rise in farm commodity 
prices to show through more noticeably at the re tail level, so that f ood prices accelerate as 
well.  In the second quarter, food price inflat ion is projected to remain elevated while

consumer energy prices are projected to decele rate somewhat, leading to the step-down in 
overall inflation.  Since the January Tealbook, we have revised up our forecast for total 
PCE price inflation 1¼ percentage  points in the first quarter and about 1 percentage point 
in the second quarter.  
We have made much smaller revisions to our forecast of core inflation.  We had 
seen the increase in core prices of just ½ perc ent at an annual rate in  the fourth quarter as 
transitorily low and had ther efore been looking f
or a rebound  in core inflation this 
quarter, and indeed that rebound appears to have  taken place.  We now expect core PCE 
prices to rise about 1 percen t this quarter and 1¼ percent in the second—in both periods, 
¼ percentage point higher than in the Ja nuary Tealbook.  The upward revisions reflect a 
somewhat higher-than-anticipated reading on co re PCE inflation in January as well as 
larger-than-expected increases in import and commodity prices. 
Measures of long-term inflation expectati ons have changed little since the January 
Tealbook.  Median 5-to-10-year-ahead infl ation expectations from the Thomson 
Reuters/Michigan survey edged up to 2.9 pe rcent in the final January survey and 
remained at that level in February.  Expect ations for PCE price inflation over the next 
10 years, as measured by the Survey of Pr ofessional Forecasters, reversed a small 
downtick in the fourth quarter of last year and are back to  2.1 percent in the current 
quarter.  Since the time of th e January Tealbook, the TIPS-based measure of five-year 
inflation compensation is up ¼ percentage po int while the five-year forward rate of 
inflation compensation is little changed. 
The P&C measure of hourly compensation increased at an  annual rate of 
2 percent in the fourth quarte r, in line with our expecta tions in the January Tealbook.  
The employment cost index (ECI) rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate —also close to our 
expectations.  However, average hourly earn ings in January and February were higher 
than anticipated, on average, and we rais ed our projection for the increase in 
compensation per hour in the current quarter to an annual rate of 3 percent, about 
½ percentage point above the January Teal book projection.  As in  previous Tealbook 
forecasts, we expect that the first-quarter increase in hourly compensation, as well as the 
ECI, will be temporarily boosted by an increase in employer contributions to state 
unemployment insurance funds, and we project smaller increase s in the second quarter.

THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
Our medium term outlook has changed littl e since the January Tealbook, with real 
GDP still projected to increase 3¾ percent in 2011 and 4½ percent in 2012.  Although the 
similarities in top-line GDP growth mask some small differences in its composition, the 
basic story of the projection remains the same :  Private demand accelerates this year and 
next as the drag from earlier declines in  wealth diminishes, lending standards ease 
further, the labor market gradually rec overs, and household and business confidence 
continue to recuperate.  However, a nu mber of factors still weigh on the outlook, 
including a large overhang of vacant residentia l and commercial properties, the waning of 
federal fiscal stimulus, and budgetary pressu res on state and local governments.  As a  
result, the projected recovery is less robust than those that have typically followed deep 
U.S. recessions, and we expect the unemploy ment rate at the end of 2012 to remain 
elevated at 7½ percent.  
As in previous Tealbooks, we expect c onsumer spending to gradually accelerate 
over the forecast period in response to the same  factors that drive th e broader recovery.  
In addition, the one-year reduc tion in payroll taxes boosts PCE growth in 2011, although 
some of that boost is reversed in 2012 when the tax cut expires.  Relative to the January Tealbook, our projection for real PCE gr owth in 2011—at 3¼ percent—is somewhat 
lower, reflecting the weaker-than-expected incoming data and higher oil prices; in 2012, 
we project real PCE to rise almost 4 percen t, close to the Januar y projection.  Largely 
because spending is projected to respond gr adually to the extra disposable income  
generated by the payroll tax cut, the persona l saving rate is exp ected to move up to 
5¾ percent this year but then  to drop back down to 5¼ percent in 2012 when the tax cut 
expires, a shade below our current es timate for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Similarly, business outlays on E&S are projec ted to post solid gains of more than 
11 percent, on average, over the next two years, as rising sales, improved business 
confidence, and expanded availability of bank credit induce firms to replace aging capital 
and expand their capacity.  In addition, i nvestment demand should continue to be 
supported by projects that were postponed dur ing the recession.  Fina lly, we expect that 
the expensing provisions of the stimulus packag e will slightly raise th e rate of growth of  
equipment investment in 2011 and reduce it in 2012.   
We also expect net exports to make a positive contributi on to GDP growth, 
amounting to about ¼ percentage point per y ear on average over the forecast period.

Continued modest dollar depreciation and r obust foreign activity should bolster real 
exports of goods and services; in our forecast, exports expand at an annual rate of nearly 
10 percent this year and next.  Real imports are projected to rise almost 6 percent on 
average in 2011 and 2012, as the boost from U. S. demand growth is only partly offset by 
the drag from the depreciating dollar.  In all,  the contribution from net exports is expected 
to be slightly stronger than in our previous  forecast on account of the lower value of the 
dollar.  
In contrast, the outlook for the construc tion sector rem ains bleak.  Although we 
still expect housing demand to strengthen a bit in coming quarters as the declines in 
house prices taper off and prospects for j obs and incomes improve, homebuilding will 
continue to be held down by a large and pers istent overhang of vacant homes.  As a 
result, we project only a gradual firming in  new construction, with single-family housing 
starts reaching an annual rate of 660,000 units by the end of 2012—more than 200,000 
units higher than in the current quarter but still well below the pace we believe is 
consistent with the longer-run demand for housing.  In the nonresidential sector, we 
anticipate the declines in spending to taper o ff.  But high vacancy rates, low commercial 
property prices, and persiste nt tight borrowing conditions for construction loans for 
commercial real estate will likely prevent any meaningful recovery in building construction over the medium term.  Although hi gh energy prices will likely continue to 
provide some support for investment in dr illing and mining structures, we expect 
investment in nonresidential structures as a whole to be about flat through 2012.   
Government purchases are projected to be a slight drag on real GDP growth 
throughout the forecast period.  In the federal sector, reductions in spending related to 
overseas military operations, the phasing out  of stimulus-related nondefense spending, 
and the tightened environment for discretionary  appropriations are proj ected to lead to a 
marked deceleration in real fede ral purchases, from a 5 percent rise in 2010 to negligible 
growth in 2011 and a decline of ¾ percent in  2012.  In the state and local sector, budgets 
are expected to be bolstered by a continued rise in tax receipts over the forecast period.  However, the phase-out of the federal stimul us funds will partially offset this revenue 
increase, and we expect real spending to be quite restra ined—falling ¾ percent in 2011 
and rising only ½ percent in 2012.  (See the box  “The Fiscal Condition of State and Local 
Governments” for further discussion.)

The  Fiscal  Condition   of  State  and  Local   Governments   
State  and  local  governments   have  faced  significant   fiscal  strains  since   the  onset  of  the  
recession,   primarily  because  of  a  drop  in  their  tax  revenues.   Tax  receipts,  shown   in  the  
left‐hand  figure  below,  plunged  in  2009,  reflecting   the  adverse  effects  of  the  economic   
downturn   on  income  and  sales  taxes,  most  of  which  are  collected   by  state  governments.   
In  contrast,   property  tax  collections—primarily   accruing  at  the  local  level—continued   to  
rise  despite  the  fall  in  house  prices.   It  appears  that  property  tax  collections   have  been   
held  up  by  the  substantial   lag  from  market   values  to  assessed   values  and  by  the  
willingness   of  some  jurisdictions   to  raise  property  tax  rates.    Nevertheless,  local  
governments   have  had  substantial   budget   difficulties   due  to  cuts  in  grants‐in‐aid  from  
state  governments.  
The  non‐infrastructure   stimulus  grants  provided   by  the  federal   government,   the  dark   
gray  area  in  the  right‐hand  figure  below,  have  helped  offset   much   of  the  shortfall   in  tax  
revenues   seen  by  states  and  localities.    Even   so,  these   governments   have  reduced   
operating   expenditures   other  than  transfers   in  order   to  satisfy  requirements   that  
operating   budgets  be  balanced   and  to  meet  an  increased   demand  for  Medicaid   (which   
reflects,   in  part,  a  cyclical  pickup).1   Notably,   as  shown  in  the  left‐hand  figure   on  the  facing  
page,  the  sector  trimmed  payrolls  by  roughly  400,000  workers  over  the  past  two  years  
with  the  decline  mostly  at  the  local  level.   Turning  to  capital  budgets,  construction   
expenditures   (not  shown)  have  fallen  about  8  percent  from  their  peak  in  mid  2009.2   As  a  
result  of  the  cuts  in  total  purchases,   the  sector  subtracted   about  0.15  percentage   point  
from  the  rate  of  change  in  real  GDP  in  both  2009  and  2010.   
1 Operating budgets, as presented in the national income and product accounts, consist of 
operating revenues (tax receipts plus noninfrastructure grants)—the black line in the right hand figure 
above—and operating expenditures (expenditures excluding outlays for infrastructure)—the red line in 
the figure. Revenues (including grants) and expenditures associated with infrastructure projects are 
part of separate capital budgets. 
2 The reduction in construction outlays is heavily concentrated in the local education category. In 
contrast, highway construction, which is receiving considerable support from the infrastructure stimulus 
grants provided by the federal government, has increased over this period.

recent  years;  at  16  percent  of  GDP,  though,  it  is  no  higher  than  it  was  in  the  early  1990s.   
Moreover,   interest  payments   on  debt  are  a  small  share—roughly   5  percent—of   the  total  
outlays  of  state  and  local  governments.   
We  expect   aggregate   state  and  local  revenue  collecti ons  to  improve  gradually   as  the  
economic   recovery  progresses.    However,   because  the  unwinding   of  the  federal  stimulus  
funds  is  expected   to  offset  a  large  part  of  the  cyclical  pickup  in  tax  receipts,  state  and  
local  government   spending   is  likely  to  remain  quite  subdued  this  year  and  next.   We  
project  that  the  purchases   of  state  and  local  governments,   the  right‐hand  figure   below,  
will  subtract   roughly  0.1  percentage   point  from  the  growth  rate  of  real  GDP   in  2011  and  
add  only  a  bit  in  2012—a  contribution   to  economic   activity  substantially   below  the  
sector’s  long‐run  historical   average.   Fiscal  conditions   vary  considerably   among  
jurisdictions   and  undoubtedly   those  states  and  localities  experiencing   the  most  severe  
strains  will  find  it  necessary   to  reduce  outlays  or  raise  taxes  materially.    However,   viewed  
from  the  perspective  of  the  sector  as  a  whole,  the  spending   restraint  in  our  forecast  is  
sufficient   to  keep  operating   budgets  in  surplus  through  2012—the   difference  between   
the  black  and  red  solid  lines  in  the  right‐hand  figure   on  the  facing  page.  
Looking  beyond  the  medium‐term  recovery  in  state  and  local  government   finances,   the  
sector  faces  several  daunting   long‐term  challenges.     Perhaps  most  important,   these  
governments   have  an  estimated   $2  trillion  to  $3  trillion  in  unfunded   accrued  pension  
liabilities.    Accrued  pension  benefits  are  generally   protected   by  constitutional   or  tough  
statutory   provisions   and,  therefore,   are  likely  ultimately   to  be  funded.   Although   
unfunded   pensions   are  a  significant   long‐term  challenge,   these  governments   typically  
have  ample  assets  on  hand  to  cover  current   payments,   and  most  will  have  many  years  in  
which  to  address  this  issue.   Governments   will  also  confront  the  rising   expense   of  
providing   health  care  to  their  retired  employees.    These  obligations   are  almost  
completely   unfunded   and,  in  present   value  terms,  are  estimated   by  some  analysts  to  be  
in  the  neighborhood   of  $600  billion.   Unlike  pensions,  though,  these  obligations   are  
generally   not  afforded  the  same  level  of  legal  protection   and  so  could  be  adjusted  more  
easily.   Finally,  states  will  continue  to  confront  budget  pressures   as  Medicaid   outlays  are  
pushed  higher  by  continued   fast‐rising  health‐care  costs.

AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU 
The sharp decline in the unemployment rate over recent months despite only 
modest growth of real activity suggests that the gr owth of potential output has been lower 
than we had previously estimated.  In this  forecast, we have reduced our estimate of 
potential GDP growth by an average of about 0.2 percentage point per year from 2009 to 
2011.  We implemented this change by making a downward adjustment to potential hours 
growth, partly on the view that the recent low readings on labor force participation 
suggest that the par ticipation rate has been on a steep er downtrend than we had been 
assuming.  In contrast, we have made no ch anges to our estimate of structural labor 
productivity, which is still assumed to rise about 2 percent per year  over the projection 
period, with a step-up in capital deepening la rgely offset by a deceleration in structural 
multifactor productivity.  We have also reta ined our assumption that the NAIRU will 
remain at 6 percent though 2012.3   
Productivity and the Labor Market 
As with our projection for real activity, the forecast for the labor market is similar 
to that in the January Tealbook.  Although labor  productivity has rise n somewhat faster 
than its structural rate in recent quarters, we continue to expect the gap between the levels 
of actual and structural produc tivity to narrow over the medium term as firms add 
workers both to meet rising production needs an d to relieve pressure s on their existing 
workforces.  Our forecast therefore calls for em ployment growth to pick up steadily over 
the projection period and for actual labor productivity growth to slow to about 1½ percent 
on average in 2011 and 2012, appreciably less than  our estimate of its structural growth 
rate of about 2 percent. 
In particular, we continue to project th at private employment  gains will step up 
from an average pace of 190,000 per month in the first half of this year to 270,000 per 
month in the second half of 2011 and 300,000 per month in 2012.  Given the sharp 
decline in the unemployment rate since the pr evious Tealbook and the similar pace of job 
growth in this projection, the unemployment ra te in this forecast is lower than in the 
3 Our estimate of the “effective” NAIRU, which includes the effect of extended and emergency 
unemployment benefits and is the level of the unemploymen t rate that we view as being consistent with no 
slack in resource utilization, is unrevised from the Ja nuary projection and is now about 6½ percent.  As 
before, we expect the effective NAIRU to decline to  around 6 percent by the end of 2012 as the extended 
and emergency unemployment benefit programs expire.

January Tealbook:  By the last quarter of 2012, the unemployment rate is projected to be 
7½ percent, ¼ percentage poi nt below the level projected in the January Tealbook.   
Resource Utilization 
The sharp decline in the unemployment rate and the reduction in potential GDP 
mean that the economy has a bit less slack in this projection than in the January 
Tealbook.  Nonetheless, the amount of current and projected slack remains large.  By our 
estimate, the unemployment rate in the curr ent quarter is about 2½ percentage points 
above the “effective” NAIRU, and at the end of  next year, the unemployment gap is still 
1½ percentage points.  This extended period of labor market slack is likely to be associated with other features of a weak la bor market, including below-trend labor force 
participation, a high percentage of workers who are involuntarily on part-time schedules, 
and an unusually large concentration of  workers experiencing long-duration 
unemployment spells.   
We continue to expect slack in the industr ial sector to be taken up sooner than in 
the economy as a whole, in part becaus e manufacturing capacity, after a cumulative 
decline of 1½ percent in 2009 a nd 2010, is projected to increase  only ¾ percent this year 
and 1½ percent in 2012.  As a result, by th e end of 2012, our projection calls for the 
factory operating rate to be clos e to its long-run average, desp ite the still-sizable gap that 
exists at that time for a ggregate resource utilization. 
Compensation and Prices 
In light of the reduced amount of labor ma rket slack and higher headline inflation 
in this projection, we have boosted our forecas t for labor costs.  In particular, we now 
project that the P&C measure of nonfarm  hourly compensation will increase about 
2 percent in 2011 and 2½ percent in 2012, about ¼ percentage poi nt faster in both years 
than in the January Tealbook; we have made a similar upward adjustment to our forecast 
for the ECI.  Despite these upward revisions, the projected increas es in compensation, 
combined with the moderate gains in produc tivity in our forecast, imply only a small 
increase in unit labor costs over the medium term. 
After increasing at an annual rate of 4¼ pe rcent in the last qu arter of 2010, prices 
of imported core goods (all goods excluding fu els, computers, and semiconductors) are 
projected to rise 7½ percent in the current quarter, the fastest pace of increase since the first half of 2008.  This jump in core import prices is driven by rising commodity prices,

dollar depreciation, and increased foreign in flation.  With more-modest changes in 
commodity prices projected for the second quart er of this year, we expect core import 
price inflation to move down to 5½ percent.  Th is forecast for the first half of the year is 
2 percentage points higher than we had writ ten down in January, mainly because of the 
recent rise in commodity prices.  We expect core import price inflation to fall back to 
1½ percent next year, unchanged from our projection in January. 
As in previous Tealbooks, we anticipate that low levels of  resource utilization will 
put downward pressure on core PCE inflation over the projection pe riod, but that further 
disinfla
tion will be checked by continued stability in inflation expectations.  However, 
given the diminished amount of slack in this forecast and the higher prices of energy and 
imports, we have raised our estimate of core PCE inflation to 1¼ percent in both 2011 
and 2012, up ¼ percentage point in each year from the January Tealbook.  We project that headline PCE price inflation will step down from almost 2 percent in 2011 to just 
over 1 percent in 2012, reflecting an anticipated deceleration in energy and food prices.  
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2015 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assessments of long-run supply- side conditions, fisc al policy, and other factors.  The 
contour of the long-run outlook depe nds on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long 
run, consistent with th e majority of longer-term inflation projections 
provided by FOMC participants  at the January meeting. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities follow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B.  The projected decline in the System’s 
holdings beginning in the second half of 2012 is forecast to contribute 
about 25 basis points to the rise in  the 10-year Treasury yield over the 
2013–15 period.  
  Beyond 2012, risk premiums on corporate equities decline gradually to 
normal levels, and banks ease their lendi ng standards somewhat further.   
  The federal government budget deficit narrows to 4¾ pe rcent of GDP by 
the end of 2015.  This improvement reflects the effects of the economic

recovery on tax receipts and transfer payments as well as further policy 
actions after 2012 aimed at  reducing the deficit. 
  The real foreign exchan ge value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate 
½ percent per year in the 2013–15 peri od.  The price of WTI crude oil 
edges up further after 2012 and reaches $105 per barrel by 2015, 
consistent with futures prices.  Foreign real GDP expands, on average, 3¼ percent per year from 2013 thr ough 2015, a bit above its trend rate. 
  Over the 2013–15 period, the NAIRU declines from 6 percent to 5¼ percent, as the functioning of the labor market improves.  Potential 
GDP expands 2¾ percent per year.  
The economy enters 2013 with the staff’s estimate of the output gap still wide by 
historical standards, the unemployment rate well above the projected NAIRU, and 
inflation very low.  In the long-run pr ojection, improving confidence, diminishing 
uncertainty, and supportive financial conditions eventually enab le the level of aggregate 
demand to catch up with aggregate supply, helpi ng inflation move closer to 2 percent.  
Specifically, real GDP rises at an averag e annual rate of 4¼ pe rcent in 2013 and 2014, 
considerably faster than its potential p ace; as a result, unemployment declines 
appreciably and inflation rise s slowly.  In response, the federal funds rate gradually 
increases to 3¾ percent by late 2014.
4  By 2015, with improvements in confidence and 
financial conditions largely comp lete, and with the federal funds rate climbing further to 
4¼ percent, gains in real GDP  moderate.  Nevertheless, ove rall economic growth remains 
robust enough relative to potential to reduce the unemployment rate to the NAIRU by late 
2015 while inflation rises to 1¾ percent. 
4 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions of the outcome-based 
rule, which is described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Incoming data on economic activity abroad have been more upbeat than we were 
anticipating at the time of the  January  Tealbook, especially in the euro area, China , and 
Mexico.  Nevertheless , we see the foreign economies facing  greater headwinds as a result  
of the turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa, which has  driven up world oil prices  
and increased  uncertainty about the global recovery.   The higher oil prices  have also  
highlighted concerns about rising inflation, and we now expect a number of  central banks  
to tighten monetary policy  sooner than we previously assumed.  Based on these factors, 
our overall outlook for foreign  growth  is slig htly softer beyond the  current  quarter than in 
the January Tealbook.  We see foreign  GDP  increasing about  3½ percent  this  year and 
next, propelled by continuing robust  growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs)  
and some firming  of activity  in the advan ced foreign economies (AFEs) .  The possibility  
that political upheaval  will spread further in the Middle East and North Africa poses a  
significant downside  risk to the global outlook.1   Moreover, vulnerabilities  in the euro -
area periphery  stemming f  rom ongoing f  iscal and banking stresses continue to be an 
important risk to the outlook.  
Foreign consumer price inflation, which increased sharply in both AFEs and 
EMEs in the fourth quarter, is estimated to remain elevated in the current quarter , at  
4¼ percent,  reflecting  accelerating  energy prices  and continued food price increases .2   
With  upward pressures on oil and other commodity  prices projected to subside, foreign 
inflation  should ease to about 2½ percent late this  year.  Relative to the  January  
Tealbook, our outlook for foreign inflation has been revised up somewhat this  year  
because of the higher path of  oil and other commodity prices.   
We continue to expect that AFE central banks will keep policy accommodative  
over the forecast period but have brought forward their policy  rate hikes, as  several  
central banks  have expressed heightened concerns about  inflation  risks.  Although EME  
authorities will likely  remain cautious about monetary  tightening f  or fear  of boosting  
capital inflows , we nonetheless anticipate additional  rate hikes  in these economies as a 
response to recent increases in headline inflation and to mitigate  the risk of  overheating.

ADVANCED FOREIGN  ECONOMIES  
Real GDP  in the AFEs  expanded at a  lackluster pace of  1¾ percent in the fourth 
quarter, with activity restrained by  adverse  weather in Europe and the  expiration of  
incentives for automobile purchases in Japan.  Indicators  for the first quarter, such as  
industrial production, purchasing managers indexes (PMIs), and retail sales , have been 
more upbeat.  The  greater momentum in the recent data has led us to raise our forecast for 
AFE growth  in the near term , but further out we have trimmed growth slightly  as a result  
of higher oil prices.  We  now expect growth to average only 2 percent over the remainder  
of this  year and rise to 2½ percent by the  end of next  year, as the drag f  rom  financial  
stresses and fiscal consolidation lessens.       
Rising commodity prices pushed up consumer price inflation in the AFEs to an 
annual rate of 3½  percent in the fourth quarter, a bit  more than we had anticipated in the  
January Tealbook.  With commodity prices  even higher now, we  revised up our inflation 
forecast for the  first half  of 2011 about ½ percentage point, to 2½ percent.   Inflation  
should gradually subside  to about 1½ percent by the end of the  year, reflecting our  
projection that  commodity prices  will stabilize  and that resource slack will  diminish only  
slowly .  
Euro Area  
Euro -area GDP grew  at an annual rate of 1 percent in th e fourth quarter, slightly  
less than anticipated in the January Tealbook, reflecting  inventory destocking and adverse 
effects of severe weather  across northern Europe.  Recent indicators  suggest  a pickup in 
activity in the current quarter.  Retail sales surged in January after contracting for five 
consecutive months.  In February, the  euro-area PMI  for manufacturing rose to its highest  
level since 2000, and the services PMI climbed further into ex pansionary territory.  The  
divergence in economic performance within the euro area remains large,  however, with  
indicators pointing to relatively vigorous  growth in Germany, moderate  growth in France  
and Italy, weak growth in Ireland and Spain, and contractions of activity in Greece and  
Portugal.   
We project euro -area GDP growth to  rise to 2 percent in the current quarter,  
reflecting in part a rebound from weather -related softness.  Growth falls to 1¼ percent  for  
the remainder of  this year, held down by higher oil prices, a stronger euro, and monetary  
and fiscal policy tightening, before  rising to 2½ percent by the  end of 2012.  In particular,  
we expect a subdued recovery of private consumption this year , with higher  energy prices

draining disposable income and with employment and consumer  confidence improving  
only slowly.  In addition, aggressive fiscal consolidation and persistent financial stresses  
should continue to weigh on activity in peripheral  euro-area countries.       
Euro -ar ea consumer prices  rose nearly 2½ percent  in February from their  year-
earlier level,  the third consecutive monthly figure above the E uropean Central Bank’s  
(ECB)  definition of price stability .  We revised up our projection for inflation in the  
region somewhat, to 2½ percent  this  year  and 1¾ percent  next year,  because l  argely  of  
recent increases in commodity prices.   At its March 3 policy meeting, the ECB kept its  
benchmark policy  rate unchanged at 1 percent and reaffirmed its commitment to provide  
ample liquidity to banks  until, at least, this summer.   However, the ECB statement  noted 
that risks to the outlook for inflation are now  distinctly  on the upside, and President  
Trichet suggested  that the ECB  may tighten policy  as  early  as April.  Accordingly, w e 
now expect the ECB to begin to raise policy rates  in the second quarter of  this year,  
three quarters earlier than assumed  in the January Tealbook, with gradual further  
increases to a rate of  2 percent  by the end of 2012.    
European Union (EU) leaders have committed to announce  a “comprehensive”  
policy response to the sovereign de bt crisis  at their upcoming summit on March 24  
and 25.  Reportedly, discussions include the possibility of strengthening the existing  
facility  for emergency len ding to distressed governments and easing terms  for exist ing 
loans to Ireland and Greece.  Howe ver, EU leaders currently appear to be far from an  
agreement on substantive measures , posing the risk that markets will be disappointed in 
the summit’s outcome .   
Japan  
Japanese real GDP declined at a 1 percent pace in the fourth quarter, as the end of  
a government subsidy for automobile purchases in September shifted overall  
consumption into reverse.  However, readings on industrial production and retail sales in 
January suggest that  GDP  growth has  resumed this quarter .  Going forward, we anticipate 
growth to rise to 2 percent by next  year, a s improving labor market conditions stimulate  
household spending a  nd Japanese exporters benefit from robust demand out of  emerging 
Asia.   This outlook is little changed from the January Tealbook.     
Consumer pric e inflation on a 12-month basis remained zero in January, 
supported by higher food and energy prices.  However, the  end of deflation is likely to be

 Economic  Risks from the Middle East and North Africa 
The global  economy  faces new risks from  the spread of political unrest in the Middle East 
and North Africa.  Following the  relatively  peaceful  ouster of the leaders of  Tunisia and 
Egypt in late January  and early February, violent clashes  erupted in Libya, where fighting 
between government  forces and the opposition  continues.   Unrest has also spread—to  
varying degrees—to  Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Oman, Morocco,  and Yemen. 
The turmoil  has increased  global risk concerns,  sending equity markets lower and  
triggering  further capital  outflows  from emerging  market economies.  The key economic  
risk from  unrest in the Middle East and North Africa stems  from the region’s importance 
in the world oil market.  Other trade and financial linkages to the United States and to the 
world economy  are less worrisome.1   
At present,  the only significant  disruption  to oil production  has been in Libya, following  
the violent civil unrest  that began in  the latter half of February.  The size  of this disruption  
is estimated  to be around 1.2 million barrels per day out of Libya’s total productive  
capacity of 1.8 million barrels per day.  Although  Saudi Arabia  has reportedly  increased  its 
oil output to help make up for this shortfall,  spot oil prices are about $15 per barrel  above 
mid‐February  levels, in  part reflecting  fears that additional  supply disruptions  could occur 
in the region.  Taken togeth er, countries  in the Middle East and North Africa (many  of 
which are experiencing  protests  of some type) produce nearly 30 million barrels of oil per 
day (see figure  below), equivalent  to more than one‐third of world production.    
  
                                                 
1 The share of the Middle East  and North Africa in non‐oil U.S. trade  is less than 2 percent,  and the 
region accounts  for about  2 percent of world GDP.  As of the end of September  2010, U.S. bank 
exposure  to the region was only $27 billion, about 3 percent of Tier 1 capital.  Bank exposure  of Western 
Europe was $203  billion,  about  9 percent of Tier 1 capital.  Large sovereign  wealth funds  in the region 
could pose risks to global financial markets if their holdings were  liquidated  rapidly, but the probability 
of such an outcome  seems remote.   
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook

Spare  oil  production   capacity  among  the  Organization   of  the  Petroleum   Exporting   
Countries   (OPEC),  which  stood  at  about  5  million  barrels  per  day  as  of  January  (lower‐left  
figure),  can  provide  a  significant   offset  to  global  supply  disruptions.2   However,  if  oil  
production   is  disrupted   in  other  countries   as  well,  this  spare  production   capacity  could  be  
rapidly  exhausted.     
As  Saudi  Arabia  is  the  main  oil  producer   in  the  region—and   as  it  holds  the  majority  of  
spare  production   capacity—a   key  risk  going  forward  is  whether  the  kingdom  will  itself  
experience  political  turmoi l.   In  an  attempt  to  preempt  unrest,  the  Saudi   monarch   
recently  announced   new  social  spending   programs  amounting   to  $36  billion  (8  percent  of  
GDP).   At  present,  significant   unrest  in  Saudi  Arabia  appears  unlikely.   But  with  an  aging  
leadership,   limited  political  freedoms,  and  sectarian   tensions,   the  possibility   of  upheaval   
in  Saudi  Arabia  should  not  be  discounted   completely.   In  such  a  scenario,   oil  prices  could  
soar  to  unpre cedented   levels.  
Temporary   oil  supply  disruptions   can  also  be  buffered  to  some  degree  by  drawing  down  
oil  inventories.   Private  commercial   oil  inventories   in  countries   belonging   to  the  
Organisation   for  Economic   Co‐operation   and  Development  (OECD)  were  equivalent   to  
58  days  of  oil  consumption   at  the  end  of  2010,  down  somewhat   from  the  very  high  levels  
in  mid‐2009  but  still  above  historical   norms  (lower‐right  figure).   In  addition,  strategic  
stocks  held  by  governments,   including   the  U.S.  Strategic   Petroleum   Reserve,  could  also  
be  released  to  manage   supply  outages.     
Since  the  January  Tealbook,   near‐term  futures  prices  for  crude  oil  have  moved  up  by  
more  than  prices  for  delivery  further  in  the  future,  suggesting   that  market  participants   
expect  the  current  supply  dislocations   to  ease  somewhat   over  time.   That  said,  futures  
prices  have  risen  considerably   at  all  maturities,   likely  reflecting   some  combination   of  
diminished   expectations   for  supply,  higher  expectations   for  demand,   and  a  larger  risk  
premium   embedded   in  futures  prices.    
2 There is essentially no spare production capacity outside of OPEC.

Japanese consumer prices to decline at an annual rate of  about ½ percent  for the  
remainder of the forecast period .   
Canada  
Real GDP expanded at a robust  pace of  3¼ percent in the fourth quarter, led by a  
rebound in commodity exports and strong consumer spending on durables.  We look for  
GDP  growth to step down to about 2½ percent over the remainder of the forecast period, 
as the strength of the Canadian dollar provides some drag on net exports and the rise in  
oil prices squeezes households’ disposable income.  However, the rise in commodity  
prices should support investment in commodity-producing industries.   
Headline inflation stood at 2.3 percent in January  on a 12-month basis, pushed up 
by rising energy prices and hikes  in sales taxes .  Energy price  increases  are likely to  
continue to exert upward  pressure on headline inflation in the first half of 2011, and , with  
growth  projected  to remain solid, we brought forward the next policy rate hike to the  
third quarter of  this year .  That said, we believe t hat the softness of core inflation and the  
strength of the currency  will bring headline inflation back down and keep the  
Bank of Canada  from tightening monetary policy  rapidly, even as the output gap 
continues to close.   
United Kingdom  
Real GDP in the Un ited Kingdom declined at  a surprising 2¼ percent  pace in the  
fourth quarter.  Exceptionally bad weather accounted for most of the decline, and a  
payback from that factor  should help boost growth to 2¾ percent in the current quarter .  
Thereafter, o ur growth  forecast  averages about  2½  percent , which is slightly  softer than 
in the January Tealbook in light of higher oil prices and, as noted below, somewhat  
tighter monetary policy .  Rising commodity prices, higher taxes, and continued pass-
through from the earlier  depreciation of sterling pushed 12-month inflation to 4 percent in  
January.  Inflation should remain elevated in 2011 before  falling back to the 2 percent  
target in early 2012 as the  aforementioned  effects dissipate.  We brought forward our first  
rate hike  by the  Bank of  England to the third quarter of this  year, as members of the 
Monetary Policy Committee  have shown heightened concerns about the risk that inflation 
expectations could become unanchored after a prolonged period of above- target inflation.

EMERGING MARKET  ECONOMIES  
Real GDP growth in the  EMEs rebounded to 5½ percent in the  fourth quarter, 
½ percentage point higher than estimated  in the January Tealbook.  The upward revision 
primarily reflects stronger- than-expected growth in China and Mexico.  For  the EMEs as 
a whole, i ncoming data on industrial production, exports, and PMIs  continue to be  
upbeat.  As with the  AFEs , however, stronger near -term momentum is likely  to be  offset  
in part  by the glo bal effects of turmoil in  the Middle East and North Africa, including  
deterioratin g  investor sentiment and ris ing  oil prices  (despite the benefit to  some EMEs  
that export oil).  All told,  we still see EME growth  proceeding  at a solid 5 percent pace on  
average over the forecast period but  a bit weaker than in the previous Tealbook.   
Headline inflation  has  picked up sharply in the EMEs in recent months.  Although 
this rise has largely  been driven by the recent run-up in food prices, in some countries, 
such as Brazil and China, nonfood inflation  has also increased .  Moreover, the  recent  
sharp increase in oil prices  should add to inflation  pressures .  As  a result, we revised up 
our inflation forecast for  the EMEs in t he current  quarter to 5¾ percent .  Thereafter , with  
commodity prices  projected to  flatten out, we  see inflation settling  down to about  
3¼ percent , as in the January Teal book.  This  decline in inflation  assumes that EME 
authorities  will continue to tighten  monetary policy  and allow  some moderate exchange 
rate appreciation.    
China  
Revised data show that Chinese real GDP  rose 10½ percent in the second half of  
last  year, nearly 1 percentage point stronger than previously  reported.  For the current  
quarter, we see  growth slowing to 9 percent, in line with somewhat lower PMI  readings  
in January and February.  Exports and imports increased sharply in January, with the  
trade balance turning to a small deficit.   Going forward, we have revised the forecast  
down a touch, to a still robust pace of 8½ percent  on average over the next two years.    
Headline inflation in China edged higher in January, to around 5 percent on a  
12-month basis.  Moreover, nonfood inflation moved up to about 2½ percent.  We see 
headline inflation coming down later this  year  as  commodity prices stabilize and credit  
growth is reined in.  Since late January, Chinese authorities have continued their gradual  
tightening of monetary policy, raising both the one- year  lending and deposit rates  
¼ percentage point and banks’ reserve  requirement ratios ½ percentage point.  The  
renminbi has been flat against the dollar since the  previous Tealbook and has appreciated

Food  Prices  and  Foreign  Inflation   
Food  commodity   prices  have  jumped  dramatically   since  mid‐2010,   regaining   their  
2008  peaks,  as  prices  for  corn,  soybeans,   and  wheat,  among  other  products,  
have  surged  (see  the  figures  below).   These  increases   are  raising  headline  
inflation,  particularly   in  emerging   market  economies   (EMEs),  and  are  placing  an  
increased   burden   on  the  poor.    
Both  demand  and  supply  factors  are  contributing   to  the  food  price  run‐up.   The  
global  recovery,  with   especially   robust  growth  in  EMEs,  has  boosted  world  
demand  for  food.   At  the  same  time,  the  supply  of  wheat   has  been   reduced  by  
droughts   in  Russia  and  Ukraine  this  past  summer  and  in  Argentina,   East  Africa,  
and  China  more  recently,   as  well   as  excessive  and  untimely  rains  last  summer  in  
Canada,  Europe,  and  Australia.    Likewise,   high  temperatures   in  the  United  States  
led  to  disappointing   corn  yields  in  the  fall.   Prices  for  soybeans   have  also  been   
boosted  by  poor  weather.    (Unlike  prices  for  other  staple  crops,   rice  prices  have  
increased   only  modestly   amid  record  production.)    Policy  decisions   are  also  
raising  prices:   A  few  food‐importing   countries   have  made  large  precautionary   
purchases,   and  some  major  producing   countries   have  curtailed  food  exports.   
Barring  further   supply  shocks,  there   is  good  reason  to  expect  that  food  price  
increases   will  be  more  moderate  going  forward.   For  corn  and  soybeans,   the  
futures  markets  predict  that  prices  will  begin  to  ease  later  this  year,  consistent   
with   the  return  of  more  normal  weather  conditions   and  an  expansion   of  the  
acreage  devoted  to  these  crops.   Futures  markets  currently   show  wheat   prices  
increasing   but  at  a  more  subdued  pace  over  the  next  year.    
For  the  advanced   foreign  economies,  as  for  the  United  States,  the  jump  in  food  
commodity   prices  has  increased   headline   inflation  only  minimally:    Consumer   
prices  for  food  have  risen  at  about  the  same  pace  as  overall  inflation  during  the  
past  year  (lower‐left  figure  on  the  facing  page),  although  larger  increases   may  
yet  come.

In  contrast,   surging  crop  prices  have  had  a  significant  effect  on  consumer   prices  
for  food  in  the  EMEs.   These   prices  jumped  nearly  7  percent   over  the  12  months  
ending  in  January,   accounting   for  most  of  the  increase  in  EME  headline  inflation  
over   the  past  year  (lower‐right  figure).   The  relatively   larger  effect  of  food  
commodity   prices  on  EME   inflation  in  part  reflects  the  fact  that  food  products   
consumed   in  the  EMEs  are  more  heavily  weighted   toward   less  processed  foods,  
the  prices  of  which  are  influenced   more  directly   by  raw  commodity  prices.   In  
addition,  food  products   comprise  one‐fourth   to  one‐third  of  the  weight  in  the  
typical   EME   consumer   price  index  compared   with  a  less  than  10  percent  weight  
for  the  advanced   economies.  
The  surge  in  food  commodity   prices  poses  challenges   for  monetary   policymakers,  
especially   in  the  EMEs.   As  output   gaps  in  the  EMEs  have  narrowed,  central  banks  
have  struggled   to  calibrate  a  pace  of  monetary   tighte ning  that  would  keep  
inflation  in  check  without  attracting   substantial   capital  inflows  and  inducing  
unwelcome  currency  appreciation.    Rising  food  prices  further  complicate   the  
policymaker’s  task:   Should  the  commodity   boom  lose  steam,  as  indicated   by  
futures  markets,  monetary   policy  would  have  increased   room  for  maneuver.   
Conversely,  further  shocks  to  food  prices,  especially   in  an  environ ment  of  
dwindling   resource  slack,  could  spill  over  into  inflation  expectations,   wages,  and  
core  inflation,  requiring   a  step‐up  in  the  pace  of  monetary   tightening.

about 4 percent  since Chinese authorities announced greater flexibility of the exchange 
rate in late June.   However, on a real trade-weighted basis, the renminbi has depreciated 
about 1¾ percent since June. 
Other Emerging Asia  
Elsewhere in  emerging Asia, economic activity  in the fourth quarter  generally  
rebounded from its  soft third quarter.  This bounceback was particularly evident  in the  
ASEAN-4 countries.  In the current quarter, we  expect  growth in emerging Asia  
excluding China to pick up further.  Exports rose  significantly in a number of  these 
economies in January, and industrial production growth was  generally positive.  Beyond 
the current quarter, growth holds steady  at about 4¾ percent.  This outlook is a touch 
weaker than in the January  Tealbook, as  the recent rise in commodity prices  is likely to  
exert some drag on economic activity .  
Sharp increases in food prices in December  and January boosted overall consumer  
prices more  rapidly than we had anticipated, and we expect further upward pressure in 
the near term after the recent  jump in oil prices.   Barring additional  increases in  
commodity prices, spillovers to nonfood inflation should gen erally  remain contained, and 
we expect inflation to moderate later this  year.  We assume that central banks  will 
continue to withdraw monetary stimulus , albeit  at a restrained pace,  while allow ing  some 
moderate further currency appreciation , in line with p rojected movements in the  
renminbi. 
Latin America  
We now estimate that real GDP in  Latin America rose at  an annual rate of  
4¼ percent in the fourth quarter, about  1¼ percentage points faster than we projected in 
the January Tealbook.  This upward revision reflects  stronger- than-expected growth  of 
5 percent in Mexico , where both industrial output and the services sector  grew solidly , as  
labor market  conditions improved.  Brazil ian growth  in the fourth quarter , at 3 percent , 
was a bit lower than we had anticipated; consumption was strong, but investment  
spending slowed significantly.  We have boosted our forecast for  Latin American growth 
this quarter and next, to about 4¼ percent,  reflecting strong incoming data  for Mexico.  In 
the remainder of the forecast period, growth holds steady  at about 4 percent, a little lower  
than in the previous outlook on account of  the weaker  outlook for U.S. manufacturing  
production.  With Latin America being  a net exporter of commodities, the recent

increases in the price of  oil and other commodities should not  restrain activity  for the  
region as a whole.    
Headline i nf lation has  eased a bit in Mexico  recently , with the 12-month rate  
edging below the upper  end of the central bank’s 2  to  4 percent target range in January.   
But this decline entirely reflects the passing out of  last year’s rise in sales taxes and  
administered prices  from the 12- month inflation calculation; in recent quarters , inflation  
has picked up.  In Brazil, 12-month inflation  rose to  6 percent in  February .  In addition to 
commodity price increases, higher inflation in Brazil is being driven by continued lax  
fiscal policy and rapid consumer credit  growth, pointing to possible overheating of the  
economy.  In response, the Brazilian cent ral bank raised its target policy rate   
50 basis points to 11.75 percent  in early March.  The policy  rate has been  raised a 
cumulative  300 basis points since  early last  year.

Financial Developments  
Market participants  appeared to read the incoming economic data  over the 
intermeeting period  as somewhat better than  expected , but  the escalation of  unrest in the  
Middle East and North Africa (MENA)  and the consequent rise in oil prices have  
weighed on market sentiment  since mid -February .  Over the period as a  whole, the 
expected policy  path  shifted up beyond the one-year horizon, yields on nominal Treasury  
securities  increased  about 10 to 30 basis points, broad stock price indexes posted modest  
gains, and risk spreads on corporate bonds  narrowed moderately .   TIPS -based inflation 
compensation at the five-year horizon increased  notably  amid rising oil pric es,  while  
measures of  forward inflation compensation beyond the five-year horizon increased  
considerably less .  Conditions in short-term funding  markets were little changed  over the 
intermeeting period .  The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the  U.S. dollar  
declined about 1 percent, as relatively  good incoming macroeconomic data  for Europe, 
combined with prospective tightening of monetary  polic y by  several foreign central  
banks, appeared to outweigh the effects of flight -to-safety flows  related to  concerns about  
the MENA region .  
Borrowing by nonfinancial corporations moderated a bit but stayed robust in the  
first two months of 2011.  Indicators of business  and consumer credit quality  continued to 
improve.  However, f inancing c  onditions for commercial real es tate  generally remained  
tight.  In addition, house  prices continued to decline , reflecting the large inventory of  
unsold homes, still-tight financing conditions, and perhaps households ’ concern that  
house prices  might fall further.  
Bank credit declined, on average, in January and  February because of  a 
contraction in core loans,  while  holdings  of securities  were about flat .  Bank  profitability  
improved somewhat  further in the fourth quarter  of 2010, but the increase was  
attributable to reduced loan loss provisioning rather than higher  revenues .  Responses to 
the March 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey  on Dealer Financing Terms  
(SCOOS)  indicated an easing of price and nonprice credit terms  for a wide range of  
counterparties over the past three months  (see appendix) .  M2 expanded moderately in 
the first two months of 2011, mainly  because of  continued robust growth in liquid 
deposits.

POLICY  EXPECTATIONS  AND TREASURY  YIELDS   
The January  FOMC statement was largely in line with market expectations  and 
elicited only a modest market reaction , although the  characterization  of the economic 
outlook was reportedly  marginally less optimistic than some  investors had anticipa ted.1   
Over  the weeks following the  FOMC meeting,  policy expectations  moved higher , as  
market participant s  read  the incoming  economic data as somewhat better than  expected , 
on balance,  and viewed the minutes of the January  FOMC  meeting as slightly more  
upbeat about the strength of the economic  expansion than the  FOMC statement.   
However, s ince mid -February , policy expectations  have retraced a portion of their  earlier  
rise amid  concerns about  the possible economic fallout from the  escalation of  unrest in 
the MENA region .  The flatter policy path  may have been  reinforced by Chairman  
Bernanke’s semi annual  monetary policy  testimony , which market participants reportedly  
interpreted as  emphasiz ing  that  the current  stance of  monetary policy would likely be  
maintained  for some  time .  
On net, both the  mean  and modal paths of the  expected federal funds rate shifted 
higher beyond the one-year horizon.  Futures quotes, combined with the staff’s usual  
assumption about term premiums, suggest  that market participants ’ mean expected pat h 
for the federal funds rate  rises above the  current target range during the first quar ter of 
2012 and reaches  about 1.5 percent two years  from now.  The modal policy  path derived 
from q uotes on interest rate caps  moves  above the c urrent target range in th e second  
quarter of 2012, one  quarter earlier than  at the time of  the most recent  FOMC  meeting .  
Results from the  Open Market  Desk’s latest survey  of  primar y dealers also  
suggest that investors’  expectations regarding the  outlook for policy have changed little  
since January.    The median expectation for the total size of the asset purchase program  
was unchanged at $600 billion, although the range of estimates across dealers narrowed  
considerably.  Dealers  revised up  slightly  their forecasts  for economic g rowth and 
inflation  in the current and next two years, and they revised down their outlook for the  
unemployment rate over  the same period.  
Intermediate - and longer- term Treasury  yields generally  followed a pattern  
similar to  those of policy expectations.  Yields rose strongly  early in the period but  
subsequently retraced  those gains, with 2 -, 5-, and 10- year  yields ending the period up 13, 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 16 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 3 basis points .

27, and 20 basis points, respectively.  The decline in yields  since mid -February seemed to  
reflect , in part, flight -to-safety flows ;  yields dropped appreciably on days when stock 
prices fell , and staff term premium  estimates  declined as well .  Market -based measures  of 
uncertainty about long-term Treasury y  ields ended the period slightly lower on net. 
TIPS - based inflation compensation over the next 5 years rose  32 basis points, on 
net, over the intermeeting period.  Most of the increas e was concentrated at the front  end 
of the curve, mainly  reflecting the jump in oil prices resulting  from the political unrest in  
the MENA r egion, as well as  slightly  stronger -than- expected January  PPI  and CPI data.  
Inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was  up only 14 basis points over the  
intermeeting period .  Staff models attribute about  one-half of this increase to a rise in  
expected  inflation.  Forward inflation compensation derived from inflation swaps  also  
increased  14 basis points.  M easures of short - and long- term inflation expectations  from  
the Thomson Reuters/Michigan survey  rose a bit , while those from the Survey of  
Professiona l Forecasters  were unchanged.  
ASSET MARKET  DEVELOPMENTS 
Broad stock price indexes  rose  about 2½ percent , on net, over the intermeeting  
period.  Stock prices trended up through mid- February, reportedly  as investors  read the 
incoming economic data  as somewhat better than expected, on balance, and as corporate 
earnings reports continued to come in above analyst s’  forecasts.  However,  the escalati on 
of political turmoil in  the MENA region weighed on stock prices over the  past few  
weeks.   Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index rose sharply in mid -February  
from about 16 percent to about 23 percent  and has  since remained somewhat elevated at  
around 20 percent.  T he staff’s estimate of the spread between the  expected real  equity  
return for S &P 500 firms and the real  10-year  Treasury yield —a measure of the equity  
risk premium—narrowed a touch more over the period but continued to be quite  elevated  
by historical standards.   
Spreads of  yields on BBB- rated and speculative- grade corporate bonds  relative to  
those on comparable- maturity Treasury securities  declined  10 basis points and 33 basis 
points , respectively, over the intermeeting period .   The modest  narrowing  of  corporate 
bond spreads reflect ed  substantial declines in  near -term forward  spreads , consistent with 
a more upbeat assessment of the near -term outlook for corporate  credit quality.  Far-term 
forward spreads for s peculative- grade bonds  remained  near the bottom of their range over

the past two decades .  In the  secondary  market for syndicated  leveraged loan s, the 
average bid price continued to increase.   
Conditions in short- te rm funding markets were little chang ed over the 
intermeeting period.   Overnight  rates on federal funds, general collateral  repo s, and 
Eurodollars moved slightly lower, on balance, while  rates at other tenors were roughly  
flat  (see box “ Recent  Developments in Overnight Money Market Rates”).  N ear-term 
spread s of dollar  Libor over comparable- maturity  OIS rates  continued to edge higher, but  
forward  measures of dollar funding pressures  were little changed .  Thirty -day s preads  of 
yields  on both A2/P2- rated nonfinancial  commercial paper  and AA -rated ABCP  over  
rates on AA -rated nonfinancial paper  remained low .  In addition, haircuts  in the repo 
market edged down, on balance, across most  collateral types.    
In the March 2011 SCOOS , dealers reported  a further easing in  price and nonprice  
terms  across different counterparty types over the  past three months for  all transaction  
categories  covered in the  survey (see appendix).  Dealers  also noted that demand for  
funding  had increased for a broad  range of securities  over the  same period .  Despite these 
changes , measures of activity in a number of funding  markets (for example, the triparty  
repo market) remained  well below levels seen prior to the financial crisis.   In response to 
special  questions , dealers reported  an increase in the use of leverage over the past six  
months by traditionally unlevered investors—in particular , asset managers,  insurance 
companies, and pension funds.  Dealers  also noted that increased leverage was  
widespread  across hedge funds over the same reference period .  
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations was solid in January and 
February , although it did not match the sizable  figure posted in the  fourth quarter.   Net  
issuance of  investment-  and speculative- grade bonds was robust  in each of the first two  
months of this  year.  The outstanding amount of c ommercial and industrial (C&I )  loans  
increased , on balance, while outstanding  nonfinancial commercial paper  was  little  
changed .   Institutional investors’  gross purchases  of newly issued l  everaged syndicated 
loans  have remained  robust, as borrowers have  refinanc ed  a substantial volume of  loan s 
originally  issued in 2010.  Demand for  this asset class by  retail investors has  shown no 
signs of aba ting  since the beginning of the  year, contributing to a  further narrow ing of  
credit  spreads, an  erosion of traditional maintenance covenants, and a  gradual rise in  the 
leverage embedded in buyout transactions.

Recent  Developments  in  Overnight  Money  Market  Rates  
Since  the  beginning   of  the  year,  some  key  overnight  money  market  rates  have  
declined  somewhat   relative  to  the  interest  rate  paid  on  excess   reserves   (the  
IOER  rate).    As  shown  in  the  figure  below,  the  February   averages   for  the  
overnight  federal  funds,  Treasury  general   collateral   (GC)  repo,   and  Eurodollar   
rates  were  3  to  6  basis  points  lower  than  their  average  values  in  the  fourth  
quarter   of  last  year.   This  recent   softening   in  rates  likely  reflects  in  part  the  
ongoing  large‐scale  asset  purchases   (LSAPs)  and  the  decline  of  balances  in  the  
Treasury’s  Supplementary   Financing   Account  (SFA),  both  of  which   have  
boosted  the  quantity  of  reserves   in  the  banking  system  and  reduced  the  
available  supply  of  collateral   in  the  repo  market.   These  factors  are  expected   to  
continue  to  put  downward   pressure  on  overnight  rates  in  coming  months.   A  
forthcoming   change  to  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC)  insurance   
assessments   is  expected   to  further   depress  overnight  rates  relative  to  the  rate  
paid  on  excess   reserves,  although  the  size  of  the  effect  is  uncertain.     
The  ongoing  LSAPs  by  the  Federal  Reser ve  and  the  decline  in  the  Treasury’s  SFA  
would  tend  to  affect  money  markets  in  the  same  way,  so  separating   the  effects

of  the  two  changes  is  difficult.   Since  the  beginning   of  2011,   the  Federal  Reserve  
has  purchased   about  $230  billion  of  Treasury  securities,   of  which  about  
$50  billion  have   been   reinvestments   of  payments   of  principal  on  agency  debt  
and  agency  mortgage ‐backed  securities;   in  addition,   over  recent  weeks,  
Treasury  bills  issued  to  fund  the  SFA  have  declined   by  $125  billion.   These  factors  
have  contributed   to  an  increase  in  reserve  balances  of  about  $340  billion.   
Although  estimates   are  subject  to  considerable  uncertainty,  the  declines  in  
overnight  rates  this  year  are  consistent  with  results   from  econometric   models   
of  the  relationship   between  money  market  rates,  reserve  balances,   and  the  
amounts  of  repo  collateral   outstanding.  
The  upcoming   modification  of  the  FDIC   premium   assessment  base  could  put  
further  downward   pressure  on  overnight  rates  relative  to  the  IOER  rate.1   While  
the  FDIC  previously   assessed  premiums   only  on  domestic   deposits,   the  new  
rule,  effective  April  1,  2011,   effectively   expands  the  assessment  base  to  banks’  
total  liabilities,   raising  the  dollar   amount   of  the  assessment  base  by  over  50  
percent.2   Notably,  the  new  regulation   does  not  exempt  federal  funds  
purchased   from  the  assessment   base,  increasing   the  implicit  cost  of  borrowing   
in  the  federal  funds  market.   Given  the  substantial  amount  of  reserve  balances  
in  the  banking  system,  it  seems  that  most  borrowing   in  the  federal  funds  
market  likely  is  motivated   by  the  ability  to  earn  the  IOER  rate  at  a  spread  above  
the  market  federal  funds  rate.   The  new  regulation  would,  all  else  being  equal,  
make  this  arbitrage   more  costly,  pushing  down  the  rate  at  which  banks  would  
be  willing  to  borrow  funds  in  order  to  earn  the  IOER  rate.   The  effect  of  the  
modified   FDIC  premium   assessment   base  on  the  federal  funds  rate  is  uncertain,   
but  some  industry  estimates   suggest  a  decline  in  the  federal  funds  rate  in  the  
range  of  2  to  5  basis  points.    
1 The new Basel liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), which is slated to become effective in 
2015, could be another factor introducing a wedge between money market rates and the 
IOER rate. To the extent that banks respond to the LCR by lengthening the term of their 
funding, demand for overnight funding may decline, pushing down overnight rates. 
Although market contacts have not suggested that the current softness in overnight money 
market rates is related to the LCR given the substantial time until the implementation date of 
the new requirement, banks could begin to shift their funding patterns in advance of the 
actual implementation date. This adjustment could be incremental, so discerning a specific 
effect on market rates may be difficult even if the ultimate effect is significant. 
2 The assessment continues to be applied only to FDIC insured institutions. As the 
assessment is meant to be revenue neutral, the FDIC is lowering average marginal premiums.

Gross public equity issua nce by nonfinancial firms was  relatively  subdued in 
January  and February .  In the fourth quarter, gross equity issuance  had increased , but  
equity retirements from share repurchases and  cash-financed mergers  had risen more 
strongly, pushing net equity issuance  a bit further into negative territory.  Recent  
announcements of  cash- financed mergers and new share repurchase programs suggest  
that th e pace of net  equity retirements  will increase further  in the  current  quarter.  
The majority of  fourth- quarter  earnings reports came in  over  the intermeeting  
period.  For the earnings  season as a whole,  the ratio of positive  earnings surprise s  to  
negative surprises  was nearly 3 to 1, compa rable to the average ratio  in the past few  
quarters.   Operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms  appear  to have  grow n about  
5 percent  in the  fourth quarter.  Despite the generally favorable news, over  the four weeks  
ending  in  mid-February, analysts’ forecasts  of  year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms  
were little changed  on balance.   
The credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued to improve.  In the fourth 
quarter, the  ratio of aggregate liquid assets to total assets for nonfinancial corporations  
remained near its record high, while the  aggregate debt- to-asset ratio declined a bit.   In  
January  and February , upgrades of nonfinancial  corporate bonds by Moody’s  Investors  
Service again outpaced downgrades, and the six-month trailing bond default rate for  
nonfinancial firms remained close to zero.  Meanwhile, the C&I loan delinquency rate  
fell to 3 percent in the fourth quarter, its lowest level in two years .  The expected default  
rate for nonfinancial fir ms from Moody’s  KMV declined a little  in January  and February,  
in part reflecting higher estimated asset valuations.  
Commercial mortgage debt is estimated to have  declined further in  the fourth 
quarter, a nd financing  conditions for commercial real estate  have generally  remained  
tight in 2011.  Delinquency  rates on loans in pools of commercial mortgage- backed  
securities ( CMBS )  edged  up to a record high in February .  However, in the  fourth quarter, 
delinquency rates  on commercial  mortgages  at life insurance companies and at banks  
ticked down from elevated levels.  Moreover, in the first quarter  of 2011, i ssuance of  
CMBS , which are often used to finance large  existing  properties in strong m  arkets, is 
estimated to have about maintain ed its modest fourth-quarter pace.  Data through the end 
of 2010 suggest that prices of investment- grade c ommercial real estate have stabilized at 
low level s, while those of other types of  commercial  real estate have continued to decline.

HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Mortgage rates  rose  about in line with  yields  on long er-term Treasury securities  
over the intermeeting period, leaving their spreads roughly  unchanged .  Nonetheless, with 
conforming mortgage rates remaining close to 5 percent —about 70 basis points above  
their lows last fall—r efinancing act ivity  was  tepid .   
House prices  continued to decrease, reflecting the  large inventory of unsold 
homes, still- tight financing conditions, and perhaps households ’ concern that house prices  
might fall further .  According to the repeat -sales index from CoreLogic, house prices fell  
at an annual rate of  about 6 percent in January —the  eighth  consecutive monthly decline.  
Mortgage debt  is estimated to have fa llen  again in  the fourth quarter, while  rates of  
serious delinquency—defined as the percentage of mortgage loans that are  in the  
foreclosure process or at  least 90 days delinquent—for subprime and prime mortgages  
were little changed in December  and January , respectively, at levels a little  below  their  
prior peaks.   
Consumer credit increased at an annual rate of  2.5 percent in January.  As was the  
case in the prior quarter, nonrevolving c  redit increased while revolving c  redit ran off.  
Delinquency rates on credit card  loan s in securitized pools  and on auto  loans at finance 
companies  continued to de cline through January  and have nearly returned  to their  longer-
run averages .  The number of credit card offers mailed to households  fell slightly in  
January  after having  posted significant increases over 2010.  Consumer  ABS issuance, 
which  weakened  around the end of the  year, post ed  a moderate  gain in February.   
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Over the intermeeting period, the spread of political unrest across the MENA  
region  and the subsequent spike in oil prices dominated the news in global  financial  
market s, raising concerns about global  growth prospects and causing some  flight- to-
safety flows.   However, better -than-expected  foreign macro economic  data p rovided some  
offset to the negative news.   
Advanced economy equity pri ces, which had been rising for most of the  
intermeeting period, nearly reversed  their  earlier  gains, as oil prices rose  with the  
escalation of political turmoil in Libya  and the associated disruptions  to oil production.  
Emerging market  equity indexes , which had been underperforming in recent months, 
Financial Developments

ended the period little changed.  Emerging market equity funds  continued to experience  
outflows.     
Ten-year sovereign  bond  yields in Europe  and Canada climbed early in the  
intermeeting  period but reversed most of those  increases  as tensions in the MENA region 
mounted.  Inflation compensation rose in these  economies, with most of the increase  
concentrated in the near  term and likely reflecting  the spike in oil prices.   The European 
Central Bank  (ECB) left its benchmark policy rate unchanged  at its March  meeting.   
However, during the press conference following the meeting, ECB  president Trichet  
noted that “strong vigilance” would be needed in light of upside  risks to inflation, leading  
market participants to expect a policy rate hike at the April meeting .  Market expectations  
of overnight policy rates  at the end of 2011 in the  euro area  and the  United Kingdom  
increased  35 basis points and 25 basis points , respectively,  over the intermeeting period, 
while expect ations for policy rates in Canada  and  Japan  were little changed .     
Facing more  immediate  inflation pressures, authorities in s everal emerging  market  
economies  (EMEs) acted to tighten policy over the period.  Policymakers in China again 
raised reserve req uirements and announced several new measures to cool  domestic  
property markets.  Russia and Turkey  also raised their  reserve requirements, and the  
central banks of Brazil,  Chile, Colombia, and  Indonesia  increased their policy rates.   
Yield spreads on the 10-year sovereign bonds of  Greece  relative to Ger man bunds  
increased  135 basis  points, while those of  Ireland and Portugal moved up about 50 basis 
points over the period.  Moody’s reduced Greece’s credit rating three notches to B1, and 
S&P downgraded several Portuguese  government-linked enterprises.  The increases  in 
spreads may also have reflected  concerns that European leaders will fail to  agree on  an  
expansion of the European Union’s financial assistance facilities sufficient to backstop peripheral Europe.  Even so, spreads on Spanish and Italian bonds  were little changed.  
Despite  the flight -to-safety flows related to concerns about the MENA region, the  
broad nominal index of the U.S. dollar declined about 1 percent over the period.  The  
dollar  fell only modestly  against  most EME currencies  but depreciated 1½ percent  
against the euro , likely  owing  to relatively  good incoming macro news  from Europe and 
market perceptions that the E CB  will begin raising policy rates  sooner than had been 
previously  expected.

Foreign official purchases of U.S. securities  were weak  in December and  January, 
but data on custody holdings at the  Feder al Reserve Bank of New York indicate t  hat  they 
picked up notably in February.  In particular,  foreign off icial acquisitions of Treasury  
securities  resumed in February, likely reflecting  in part investments of proceeds from  
foreign exchange intervention.  In addition, official investors acquired moderate  amounts  
of agency securities in both January and February, reversing the trend of net sales of  
these securities over the second half of last  year.  
Official published estimates on foreign holdings of U.S. debt, released at the  
beg
inning of this month, showed that China held $1.16 trillion in Treasury securities at  
the end of December 2010, substantially more than the previous  official  estimate of  
$892 billion.  The revised figures were in line with internal estimates.  
GOVERNMENT  FINANCE  
During the intermeeting pe  riod, the Treasury auctioned $267 billion of nominal  
coupon securities across  the maturity spectrum  as  well as  $9 billion of 30- year TIPS ; its  
auction  sizes were unchanged.  Overall, the auctions were well received, with bid- to-
cover ratios close to recent averages .  The 10-year note and 30-year TIPS auctions  
registered  very high shares awarded to indirect bidders, suggesting r  obust demand from  
foreign  official institutions .  As previously  announced, to provide flexibility  in debt

Supplementary  Financing Account (SFA) held at  the Federal Reserve to run off  as  total 
federal debt  outstanding approaches  the statutory  debt limit ( see box “Balance Sheet  
Developments over the Intermeeting Period ”).  
Conditions in the municipal bond market improved over the intermeeting period, 
as  heightened concerns over the  financial health  of state and local governments  
diminished somewhat  (see box “The Municipal Bond Market”).  Yields on long- term 
general obligation bonds  fell notably, le aving the ir  ratios  to  yields o n comparable -
maturity Treasury securities and to those on AAA-rated corporate bonds  narrower  but  
still  elevated  by historical standards.  Issuance of long-term municipal bonds was modest  
in January and February  following extre mely robust issuance in the fourth quarter  as the 
end of the  Build America Bond program neared.  Issuance of s hort-term municipal 
securities has  been muted so far  this  year, consistent with typical seasonal patterns.

Balance  Sheet  Developments   over  the  Intermeeting  Period  
Total  assets  of  the  Federal   Reserve  increased   by  $128  billion  over  the  
intermeeting   period  to  reach  a  level   of  about  $2.6  trillion  (see  table  on  facing  
page).   The  Federal  Reserve’s  ongoing  asset  purchase  program   boosted  
outright  securities   holdings  by  $128  billion.  
The  Open   Market  Desk   at  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  New   York   conducted   
26  operatio ns  to  purchase  longer‐term  Treasury  securities   since  the  January  
meeting.    The  operations,   which  covered  a  range  of  maturities   for  nominal  
securities   as  well  as  3  operations   in  TIPS,  totaled  $143  billion.1   To  provide  
flexibility   in  conducting   the  asset  purchase   program,  the  Desk  temporarily   
relaxed  its  per  issue  limit  on  System  Open  Market   Account  (SOMA)  holdings  of  
individual   Treasury  issues  late  last  year;  SOMA  holdings   of  40  individual   issues  
now  exceed  35  percent  of  the  total  outstanding   for  each   issue,  and   SOMA  
holdings  of  5  issues  exceed  50  percent.   Cases  in  which  SOMA  holdings   exceed  
50  percent  of  the  total  outstanding   are  all  high‐coupon  30‐year  bonds  with   a  
remaining   maturity  between   4  and  10  years.  
Loans  outstanding   under  the  Term  Asset‐Backed  Securities   Loan   Facility  (TALF)  
fell  about   $3  billion  over  the  intermeeting   period,  reflecting   additional   
prepayments   of  TALF  loans.   The  net  portfolio  holdings  of  Maiden  Lane  LLC,  
Maiden   Lane  II  LLC,  and  Maiden   Lane  III  LLC  were  little  changed.    Finally,  
foreign  central  bank  liquidity  swaps  fell  to  zero  from  an  already  very  low  level.  
On  the  liability  side  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s   balance  sheet,  Federal  Reserve  
notes  in  circulation   expanded   by  a  substantial   $23  billion  over  the  period,  likely  
boosted  by  strong  international   demand  for  U.S.  banknotes.    The  Treasury’s   
general  account,  which  is  volatile   from  month  to  month,  decreased  $59  billion,  
on  net,  and  balances  in  the  Treasury’s   supplementary   financing   account  fell  by  
$125  billion  to  about  $75  billion.   The  Treasury  has  allowed  bills  that  fund  
balances  in  the  supplementary   financing   account  to  roll  off  in  order  to  provide  
greater  flexibility   in  debt  management   as  total  Federal  debt  outstanding   
approaches   the  statutory   debt  limit.   Term  deposits  increased   to  $5  billion  as  
another  small‐value  Term  Deposit   Facility  offering  settled  on  Februa ry  10;  it  will  
mature   on  March  10.   Reflecting   these  factors  and  the  effects  of  the  asset  
purchase   program,   reserve  balances  of  depository   institutions   rose  $284  billion  
over  the  intermeeting   period.   
1 These operations include purchases conducted between January 27, 2011, and March 7, 
2011. During this period total settlements were $137 billion.

The  Municipal  Bond  Market  
The  municipal   bond  market  is  used  by  state  and  local  governments   and  their  authorities   
to  raise  money  for  schools,   highways,   utilities,   hospitals,   and  other  public  infrastructure.    
About  $3  trillion  of  municipal   bonds  are  outstanding,   with  over  50,000  borrowers;  and  
the  median  deal  size  at  issuance  over  the  past  decade  was  only  $6  million.1   This  vastly  
diverse  composition   creates  a  rather  illiquid   market,   where  disclosure  is  limited  and  
trading  is  decentralized.   Moreover,  relatively   unsophisticated   retail  investors   hold  a  
dominate   share  of  outstanding   securities   in  this  market,   either   through  direct  holdings  or  
ownership   of  shares  in  tax‐exempt  mutual  funds.2  
Over  the  past  few
  months,  tax‐exempt  mutual  funds  have  experienced   unusually   large  
net  outflows,   on  balance,  as  persistent  concerns   about  the  credit  risk  of  municipal   bonds  
were  exacerbated   by  negative  publicity.    However,  some  of  the  outflows   probably   were  
induced  by  rising  interest  rates,  which  drove  down  returns  in  such  funds.   Indeed,  net  
outflows   from  federal  government   bond  mutual  funds,  returns  in  which  tend  to  move  
inversely  with  interest  rates,   have  also  been  heavy.    
1 Of the roughly $3 trillion in outstanding municipal securities, about $2.5 trillion represents debt of 
state and local governments. The remainder represents industrial revenue bonds and the debt of some 
nonprofits. 
2 About one third of municipal securities are held directly by households and one sixth by mutual 
funds. The secondary market of municipal bonds is also opaque due to its over thecounter nature, 
despite significant improvements in trading transparency in recent years. In addition, tax and contract 
laws governing municipal bonds vary significantly across states, contributing to the market inefficiency.

Conditions   in  the  municipal   bond  market  appear  to  have  improved   significantly   over  the  
past  several  weeks.   The  pace  of  net  outflows   from  municipal   funds  has  slowed  in  recent   
weeks  (see  the  lower‐ left  figure  on  the  facing  page).   The  ratios  of  yields  on  long‐term  
general  obligation   municipal   bonds  to  those  on  comparable‐maturity   Treasury  securities   
and  to  those  on  AAA‐ rated  corporate   bonds  spiked  toward  the  end  of  2010  amid  surging  
issuance   of  Build  America  Bonds  before  the  program  expired  by  year  end   (see  the  lower‐
right  figure  on  the  facing  page).   However,  yield  ratios  have  fallen  sharply  since  Illinois  
substantially   raised  the  state’s  personal  and  corporate  income  tax  rates  in  mid‐ January,  
an  event  that  apparently   made  investors  more  confident  that  most  issuers  would  take  
necessary  measures   to  address  their  fiscal  imbalances.     
The  recent  improvements   have  been  broad  based.   On  net,  credit  default  swap   spreads  
for  most  of  the  major  municipal   bond  issuers  have  more  than  retraced   the  spikes  that  
occurred   late  last  year  (see  the  lower‐ left  figure  below).   For  most  issuers,  the  municipal   
bond  market  appears   to  have  remained   receptive.   
Despite  these  improvements,  substantial   concerns   remain  over  the  credit  quality  of  
municipal   bonds.   Yield  ratios  continue  to  be  high  by  historical   standards.   Also,  
downgrades  of  municipal   bonds  by  Moody’s  again  outpaced   upgrades   during  the  fourth  
quarter  of  2010  (see  the  lower‐right  figure  below).   Municipal   bond  defaults  are  expected   
to  pick  up  somewhat  in  the  next  few  years  after  having  come  down  from  their  recent  
peak  in  2008.   Even  so,  the  rate  of  defaults  is  expected   to  remain  fairly  low.

COMMERCIAL  BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit declined at an annual rate of about 2½  percent,  on average, over  
January and  February , reflecting a   contraction in core loans, while holdings of securi ties  
were about flat .  C&I loans  increased  about 3 percent, on average, over the  two months.  
In  contrast, c ommercial real estate loans decrease d, although the rate of  the decline  was  
somewhat below the pace of  contraction  in the second half of 2010.  Closed-end 
residential mortgage loans, which had grown for five consecutive months at the end of  
last  year,  fell a bit in  January and  more substantially in  February,  reportedly  owing 
mostly  to a significant slowing in the pace of originations.  Banks indicated that loan 
sales to the GSEs  continued at about the heavy pace of the previous few months.  Home  
equity loans and consumer loans also declined  in the first two months of 2011.2    
The Survey of Terms of  Business  Lending conducted in the first week of  
February showed that, at  domestic banks, the weighted -average  spread  of the rate on  C&I  
loans of less than $25 million over Eurodollar and swap rates of comparable maturity  
decreased noticeably in the first quarter  but remained elevated .  Spreads declined most  
notably at small domestic banks, which were  responsible for about 10 percent of  the 
gross loan ori ginations  in the  most recent  survey.  
The fourth -quarter  Call Report data , on a seasonally adjusted basis, show ed  a 
further rise in  bank profitability , although aggregate profits  remained somewhat  below  
pre-crisis levels.  Profitability  was aga in supported by reduced loan  loss provisioning  
rather than improved revenues, as pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue decreased.  The  
decline in  loss provisioning  was consistent with  improvements in broad measures of  
credit quality, but  net charge- offs nonetheless  continued to exceed  provisioning.  
Regulatory  capital ratios  generally increased further, although the pace of increase 
appears to have ebbed somewhat at larger banks.   Unused home equity lines of credit and 
credit card lines  continued to shrink in the fourth quarter , but unused commitments to 
fund C&I loans  rose somewhat  for the second  consecutive quarter .  
2 The large decline in consumer loans other than credit cards has mostly reflected two changes in 
the seasonal pattern of loan disbur sements relative to recent years.  First, r ulings by the IRS and the OCC 
stifled banks’ issuance of refund anticipation loans this year, which would normally have fueled other 
consumer loans. Second, student loans had usually been disbursed by banks in Ja nuary, but the federal 
government is now making a substantial share of these loans.  Not seasonally adjusted, this category 
decreased only slightly over the past two months.

M2 grew at a moderate  annual rate of 5 percent, on average, over January and 
February.  Liquid deposits, the largest component  of M2, expanded at about  a 9½ percent  
annual rate over the same period , down from the 13 percent pace posted in the fourth 
quarter of 2010.  Small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds contracted 
further over the first two months of the  year.  As has been the  case  for some  time, the  
compositional shift within M2 toward liquid deposits likely reflects their higher  yields  
relative to  other M2 components.  Currency  advanced at a notable 8½ percent annual rate  
over January and February, likely boosted by strong g  rowth in foreign holdings of U.S. 
bank notes as weather -related transportation difficulties , which delayed previous  
shipments, abated and  as several  regio ns experiencing  political unrest tu  rned to the safety  
of U.S. dollars .  The monetary base expanded at  a 60 percent  annual rate  in  the first two  
months of the  year as both the Desk’s ongoing purchases of Treasury securities and the 
Treasury’s  reduction of the SFA  balance in  February  boosted reserve balances.

Appendix  
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey  on Dealer Financing Terms  
Overall, respondents  to the  March 2011 Senior Credit  Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer  
Financing Terms indicated  a further easing in credit  terms across different counterparty types  and 
securities financing transactions over  the previous three months.1   Dea lers also noted an increase 
in demand for funding for all  types of  securities  considered in the  survey over the  same period.  
By contrast, respondents  generally reported little change in the terms and conditions preva iling in 
over-the-counter (OTC) derivat ives markets.2    
•  Dealer
s reported that  they had eased credit  terms, on net, for each counterparty type  
covered  in the survey .  The most important  reason  cited for  easing terms was more-
aggressive competition  from other institutions.   Other  factors cited in cluded an  
improvement in the current or expected financial strength of counterparties and an 
improvement in general market liquidity and functioning.  Respondents  again reported  an 
increase in the intensity of  efforts by clients in each major class to nego tiate more -
favorable terms.  
• Similar  to the December survey, the majority of respondents indicated that  the  amount of  
resources and attention devoted  to management of concentrated exposures to  dealers and  
other  financial intermediaries had remained basicall y unchanged over  the past three 
months.  One -fourth of respondents, however, did point to an increase.  
•  Responses  to questions about OTC derivatives transactions suggest  that nonprice terms 
on both plain and customized derivatives  were again  generally littl e changed across 
different types of underlying asset classes (underlyings).   However, moderate net  
1 The March survey collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three months in 
credit terms and conditions in securities financing and OTC derivatives markets.  In addition to the core set 
of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about the use of leverage by traditionally 
unlevered investors during the past six months; a special question on the use of leverage by hedge funds 
pursuing specific investment strategies during the past six months ; another set of special questions 
regarding third -party custody of independent amounts (initial margin) and collateral; and a final set of 
special question s about dealers’ exposure to st ates, localities, and other issuers of tax -exempt debt . The 
20 institutions participating in the survey provide almost all dealer financing of dollar -denominated 
securities to nondealers and are the most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives markets. The survey was 
conducted during the period from February 14, 2011 , to February 25, 2011 .  The core questions ask about 
changes between December 2010 and February 2010. 
2 For questions that ask about credit terms , reported net percentages equal the percentage of 
institutions that reported tightening terms (“tightened considerably ” or “tightened somewhat ”) minus the 
percentage of institutions that reported easing terms (“eased considerably ” or “eased somewhat ”). For 
questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the percentage of institutions that reported 
increased demand ( “increased considerably” or “increased somewhat”) minus the percentage of institutions 
that reported decreased demand ( “decreased considerably” or “decreased somewhat”).

fractions of dealers noted  that they had eased  certain  nonprice  terms with regard to  total 
return swaps (TRS)  with  nonsecurities ( such as bank loans)  as the underlying.3   
•  Dealers  reported  th at  they had eased  some terms on securities financing transactions on  
each  type of collateral  considered in the survey, with the most pronounced easing  being  
for asset -backed securities  (ABS)  other than agency  residential mortgage -backed  
securities ( RMBS ).  
• Dealers noted that demand for  funding of all  types of securities  covered  in the survey  had 
increased over  the past three months.   
•  In response to a set  of special questions, a number of dealers indicated  that  traditionally  
unlevered investors (asset  managers, insurance companies,  and pension  funds) increased  
somewhat their  use of  leverage over the past six months.  Respondents reported that the 
preferred  products  used to generate leverage  were OTC derivatives and rep urchase  
agreements (  repos) .  
• In response to a special question about  changes  in the use of  leverage by hedge funds 
pursuing different investment strategies, dealers  indicated that the  increase in  leverage 
was widespread across funds pursuing the strategies listed  in the survey.  The  increase in  
leverage was reported to be the greatest  among funds focused on fixed- income arbitrage,  
followed by those  pursuing  credit -trading strategies and global- macro .  
• In response to  special question s  about whether institutions’  clients have sought to arrange  
for third -party custody of  independent amounts ( initial margin ) and other  collateral  
postings, only a small  number of dealers indicated  that this issue is a significant  and 
widespread  component of discussions with clients ; howeve r, 40 percent of respondents  
indicated  that the issue has arisen  in some discussions.  
•  In response t o  speci al questions regarding  counterparty exposures to states, localities, 
and other  issuers of tax-exempt debt, three- fourths of dealers re ported  that they have  
tightened  price and nonprice  terms over  the past three months for such counterparties.  
Respondents indicated that  the sources of exposure to these counterparties that have 
necessitated  the greatest  allocation of resources and attention were OTC deri vative  
contracts  entered into in the context of debt  issuance and underwriting commitments.

financial  intermediaries had remained basically unchanged over the past  three months, although  
one-fourth of respondents pointed to an increase.  The  majority of  responden ts also noted that the  
volume of mark and collateral  disputes with dealers and other financial  intermediaries had 
remained basically unchanged over the previous  three  months, with one- fifth  of dealers reporting  
a decrease.4  
Hedge funds, private equity firm s, and other similar private pools of capital   
As has been  true for the past three surveys, the responses  indicated  that,  across all types 
of transactions covered in the survey, dealers had eased somewhat the credit  terms they provide to  
hedge funds, priva te equity firms, and  other similar private pools of capital  (private pools of  
capital) over  the past three  months.  About one-third of respondents, on net, eased somewhat their  
price terms such  as financing rates.  A  similar net fraction of  institutions reported  having eased  
nonprice  terms such as haircuts, maximum  maturities, covenants, cure periods, and cross-default  
provisions or other documentation features.   The  institutions that reported having eased terms  
pointed to more-aggressive competition from other institutions, an improvement in the current or  
expected financial strength of counterparties, and an improveme nt in general market liquidity and  
functioning  as the main  reasons for the changes.5   Nearly two -thirds of dealers noted an increase 
in the intensity of efforts by private pools of capital to negotiate more- favorable price and  
nonprice  terms over the past three months.  Looking forward over  the next three months, one-half  
of the respondents  to the March survey, on balance, indicated that  they anticipated a further  
easing of terms for  such  counterparties.  
Insurance companies, pension funds, and other institutional investors  
The survey responses indicated  that dealers also provided more- favorable credit terms  for 
insurance companies, pension funds, and other  institutional  investors  (institutional investors). A  
small net fraction of  respondents reported having  eased price terms over the past  three months,  
while one -fourth of dealers noted  an easing of nonprice terms over the same period.  As was the 
case for private pools of  capital,  the most  important reason  indicated  for  easing terms was more -
aggressive compet ition from other institutions.  Improvements in the  current or expected financial  
strength of  counterparties  and improvement in general  market liquidity and functioning were  also 
cited as important  reasons  for the change.  About  one-third of dealers report ed an  increase in the 
intensity of efforts by institutional  investors to negotiate more- favorable price and nonprice terms  
over the past three months.  Looking forward over the  next  three months, about one-third of  
respondents, on balance, expected credit  terms applicable  to institutional investors to ease  
somewhat.  
4 A rise in the volume of mark and collateral disputes is generally viewed as a leading indicator of 
market stress. 
5 An ordinal ranking of reasons for loosening or tightening is produced by adding the number of 
respondents characterizing each reason as “very important” to the number characterizing the reason as 
“somewhat important” and then sorting the sums in descending order.  For reasons with the same ranking 
based on the sums, the response that the greater number of dealers characterizes as “very important” takes 
priority.

Nonfinancial corporations  
The responses  to questions  about  credit terms applicable to nonfinancial corporations also 
pointed to an easing over the past three months.  Nearly one-third of respondents, on balance, 
indicated  that they had eased price terms, while a small net  fraction of dealers also  noted  an  
easing of nonprice terms.   As was the case for private pools of capital and institutional investors,  
the most important reason cited for easing terms for nonfinancial corporations was more-
aggressive competition from other institutions, followed by the  improvement in current or  
expected financial strength of counterparties.  About one-third of respondents indicated that  there  
had been an increase  in the  intensity of efforts by nonfinancial  corporations  to negotiate more-
favorable price and nonprice terms over the past  three  months.  Looking forward over the next  
three months, one-fifth of dealers, on balance, indicated that they anticipated somew hat looser  
terms for these counterparties.

As in  the previous three surveys, responses to questions dealing with OTC derivatives 
trades generally pointed  to  little change over  the past three months in most of the terms for “plain  
vanilla” and customized derivatives across the various underlyings—fo reign exchange, interest  
rates, equities, credit, commodities, and TRS  referencing nonsecurities.  However, about one-
fourth of respondents indicated that  they had tightened somewhat initial margins (for highly  
customized derivatives) and requirements, tim elines, and thresholds for posting additional  
margins (for  both plain vanilla and highly customized derivatives)  on trades with foreign 
exchange as the underlying.  In addition, with regard to TRS with nonsecurities as  the underlying, 
about one -third of de alers active in this market, on  net,  reported having eased somewhat initial  
margin requirements, while one-fifth of  respondents noted that they had increased somewhat their  
recognition of portfolio or  diversification benefits  in  establishing collateral requirements for  
clients’ positions.6   
SECURITIES  FINANCING  
As in the previous  survey, responses  to questions on securities  financing pointed to an 
easing of terms applicable to many different  types of  securities.7   While  generally evident for  
both average an d most-favored clients, this reported loosening of terms was more pronounced for  
most -favored clients over  the past three months.  With regard to terms under which high- grade 
corporate bonds are  funded, net shares of survey respondents ranging between about 15 and 
30 percent reported an increase  in the maximum amount of  funding, an extension in the  
maximum  maturity, a reduction in the  financing rate, and a decrease  in haircuts.  With respect  to 
terms under which equities  are  funded (including through repo-l ike stock loan  transactions), net  
fractions  of dealers ranging between about 15 and 30 percent  indicated that they had increased the  
6 In managing their counterparty exposures, dealers may require a lower amount of collateral from 
clients in recognition of potential risk -reducing correlations among positions. 
7 In this survey, securities financing includes lending to clients collateraliz ed by high -grade 
corporate bonds, equities, agency RMBS, and other ABS.

 maximum amount of  funding, extended the maximum  maturity, and eased covenants and triggers.  
Regarding terms under which agency RMBS are funded, net  portions of respondents  ranging  
between about 20 and 30 percent noted that  they had decreased haircuts  and financing rates, 
extended the maximum  maturity, and increased the maximum amount of  funding.  Finally, with 
respect  to term s under which ABS other than agency RMBS are funded, net  fractions of  dealers  
ranging between about 20 and 55 percent  reported an increase  in the maximum amount of  
funding, a decrease in haircuts, an extension in the maximum  maturity, and a decrease  in the  
financing rate.  
Survey respondents indicated that demand for  fundi ng for all types of securities  
considered in the survey had increased over  the  past three months.  Notably, demand for funding  
for ABS other than agency RMBS was reported  to have increased  by 80 percent of survey 
participants. More than one -half of dealers noted an increase  in demand for funding for agency  
RMBS, while about one-third of  survey respondents  that lend against high-grade corporate bonds  
and equities indicated that  demand for such funding had increased.  
Respondents indicated that  liquidity and functioning in several markets had continued to 
improve over the past  three months.8   Nearly 60 percent of dealers  reported an improvement in 
markets for ABS other than agency RMBS, while 40  percent of respondents noted an  
improvement in the high- grade corporate bond market.  Nearly one-fifth of dealers, on balance, 
pointed to an improvement in liquidity and functioning in the agency RMBS market.  
Survey respondents generally reported that the  volume of collateral and mark disputes 
with clients related to the  funding of collateral of all  types had remained unchanged.   
SPECIAL  QUESTIONS ON THE  USE OF  LEVERAGE BY  TRADITIONALLY  
UNLEVERED  INVESTORS  
The low interest rates that  have prevailed in recent quarters have posed particular  
challenges to  investors who, because of their investment goals or  liability structure, effectively  
have nominal return targets.  A set  of special questions  asked  dealers  about the degree to which 
their clients who  traditionally employ little or no  financial leverage and  face such  challenges have 
sought to boost returns t hrough the use of  leverage over the past six months.  The  questions also 
asked about the specific mechanisms employed in such instanc es.  About one-third of respondents  
indicated  that asset managers (acting on behalf of holders of separately managed accounts) have 
increased somewhat  their  use of  leverage over the reference period, while nearly one- fifth of 
dealers noted that insurance companies and pension funds have also done so.  The  most important  
exposure mechanisms and transaction  types used  to attain such  leverage over  the past  six months,  
according to  survey respondents, were OTC  derivatives (including  TRS) and repos. Some dealers 
also  pointed to margin loans and,  to a smaller extent, exchange- traded funds (ETFs)  as vehicles 
8 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repos and similar secured financing transactions, 
not changes in the funding market itself.

by which traditionally unlevered investors have attained higher degrees of  leverage over the 
reference period.9   
SPECIAL  QUESTION ON THE  USE OF  LEVERAGE BY  HEDGE  FUNDS  
A special  question sought information from dealers regarding possible changes during  the  
past six  months in the  amounts of  leverage applied by  their  hedge fund clients pursuing  various  
investment strategies .  Respondents reported that  the increase in the use of leverage was 
widespread across hedge funds pursuing the strategies listed  in  the survey.  In particular, more 
than one- half of dealers  indicated  that fixed -income arbitrage hedge funds increased their use of  
leverage over the past  six  months,  while about 45 percent  of  respondents noted that credit  trading  
hedge funds and global macro funds  had done so.   
SPECIAL  QUESTIONS ON THIRD -PARTY CUSTODY OF  INDEPENDENT  AMOUNTS  
(INITIAL  MARGIN )  AND COLLATERAL  
Following the  financial crisis, market partic ipants have reportedly become more 
concerned about the possible consequences  of  financial distress on the part of a dealer with whom  
they have posted collateral  pursuant  to OTC derivatives transactions, securities financings, or  
other activities.   A set of  special questions  explore d the intensity with which clients have sought 
to arrange for third -party custody of such collateral  as a risk mitigant .  In addition, these questions  
sought information concerning the classes of  clients that have most actively pu rsued this option in 
negotiations with dealers.  Although 40 percent of  respondents  indicated that the  issue has arisen 
in some discussions with current  and potential new clients  and about one- third noted  that the  
issue has occasionally arisen in such disc ussions, only  a small number of dealers  indicated that  
this issue  is  a significant and widespread component of discussions. Nonetheless, two-thirds of  
respondents  reported efforts by asset managers, including those advising mutual funds and hedge  
funds, to i  ncorporate provisions in the relevant agreements providing for the third- party custody 
of collateral have been intense.  
SPECIAL  QUESTIONS ON EXPOSURE TO  STATES ,  LOCALITIES ,  AND OTHER  
ISSUERS OF  TAX-EXEMPT  DEBT  
In recent months,  investor concerns have rep ortedly risen regarding the  fiscal pressures 
facing states, localities, and other issuers of  tax-exempt debt ( for example,  school systems,  sewer  
and water districts, and hospitals).  A final set of special questions explored the degree to which  
these  concern s have  led to changes in  credit terms applied  to such counterparties and  the reasons 
for these changes.   The questions also addressed  the sources of  exposure that have warranted the 
most attention and the changes in the frequency of mark and collateral d isputes with  
counterparties of these types.  Three -fourths of  dealers  with counterparty exposure to states, 
localities,  and other issuers of tax -exempt debt reported that they had tightened somewhat  price

and nonprice  terms  offered to  these counterparties over the past three months .  The institutions  
that reported a tightening of terms pointed to a deterioration in the current or expected financial  
strength of  counterparties, a worsening in general market liquidity and functioning, a reduced  
willingness to  take on additional risk, and higher  internal capital charges for such  transactions as 
the main reasons for  the changes.10   With regard to  the sources of exposure  to these entities that 
have warranted the most attention from  their risk -management functions over the past three 
months, dealers pointed to OTC derivative  contracts  entered into in the context of debt issuance  
(for example, to swap fixed- rate  debt to floating -rate debt) , underwriting commitments  (for 
example, to manage the sale of new debt instr uments to investors),  and credit enhancement  (for 
example, of  debt instruments or loans).  When asked about changes in the volume of mark and 
collateral disputes with states, localities, and other  issuers of tax -exempt debt over the  past three 
months, dealers with exposures  to such entities  reported no change relative to the  prior period.  
10 Higher internal capital charges effectively require a trading desk to allocate more economic 
capital to the specified transaction under the firm’s risk -governance procedures, reducing the return on a 
risk-adjusted basis.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the  risks to the outlook, we consider several alternatives to 
the baseline projection using simulations of staff  models.  We begin with a trio of  
simulations involving risks to the  inflatio n projection.  In the  first scenario, commodity  
prices  rise considerably  more  than  assumed in the staff projection while other aspects of  
the baseline forecast  (including stable inflation expectations)  remain largely  unchanged.   
The second scenario examine s a more adverse situation, in which supply bottlenecks, 
lower potential output, and an unmooring of inflation expectations accompany higher  
commodity prices.  In contrast, the third scenario considers the risk that core inflation 
may  continue to decline, along the lines pr edicted  by some of the staff’s reduced -form  
models.  We then turn to a pair of scenarios examining the risks to aggregate spending— either  that confi dence and credit availability may  not recover as quickly as  we anticipate, 
or that economic activity  may rebound more  robustly.  The final scenario consider s  the 
implications for  the outlook if geopolitical instability were to intensif y, driving up oil  
prices  and disrupting  financial conditions  in emerging market economies  (EMEs)  and in 
financi ally vulnerable economies in Europe.  
In the  alternative scenarios, monetary policy responds to movements in real  
activity and inflation as prescribed by  a simple policy rule for the  federal funds rate, 
while nontraditional policy is assumed to follow the  baseline path.  We generate the first  
five scenarios using the FRB/US model and an estimated policy  rule.  The last scenario  is 
generated using the multicountry SIGMA model, which uses a different policy rule  for  
the federal funds rate.
1  
Greater  Commodity  Price Increases  
Although oil and other  commodity prices have risen sharply in recent months, we  
have assume d that the se prices  will be roughly flat going forward , in line with futures  
markets .  However,  world supply and demand balances may well work out di fferently   
1 For FRB/US, the federal funds rate follows the outcome -based rule described in the appendix on 
policy rule s in Book B. The rule in SIGMA is broadly similar but uses a measure of slack equal to the 
difference between actual output and the model ’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the 
absence of a slow adjustment in wages and prices.

about $50 per barrel above baseline by the end of 2012 and only thereafter level out.  In 
addition, other commodit y prices continue rising and are 20 percent above baseline by the 
end of this year and 40 percent higher by late 2012.2   Mostly because of the rapid rise in 
oil prices, total PCE prices rise  2¾ percent this year  and 2¼ percent next year, about 
1 percentage point each year , on average,  above baseline.  Nonetheless, the effects of 
these substantial increases in commodity prices on core consumer prices and nominal 
wages are relatively modest because we ass ume that inflation expectations remain well-
anchored and because (following the usual predictions of our models) pass-through effects are limited (see text table “Measures of PCE Inflation in Selected Alternative 
Scenarios”).  Core PCE inflation is only about ¼ percentage point higher than in the 
baseline, on average, over the next two years. Real activity is somewhat weaker over the 
period of 2011 through 2013 than in the staff forecast , in part because higher prices for 
commodities that we import, on net, reduce real household incomes.  Monetary policy is 
little changed from baseline over this period as the additional slack is mostly offset by 
higher inflation .  This outcome is remin iscent of the 2007-08 period when some 
noticeable, but transitory, increases in total inflation coincided with only a modes t step -
up in core inflation.  
2 As a result of the increase in non -energy commodity prices, nonoil import prices are almost 
4 percent above baseline by early 2013.

Persistent Rise  in Inflation  
Something more than rising commodity prices  alone would likely  be required to 
ignite a more serious  and persistent rise in inflation.  In this scenario, we consider the  
possibility  that the higher commodity prices occur  in an environment in which the  
NAIRU is  1 percentage point above  the staff  estimate,  accelerating real activity creates  
temporary  bottlenecks that intensify price pressures, and long-run inflation expectations  
are more sensitive to persistent movements in headline inflation .  Under these conditions, 
the restraint on nominal  wage  gains is less pronounced and firms  face greater pressure to 
pass on cost increases  relative to the baseline.  All told , total inflation averages nearly  
3½ percent  over the next  five  years , and c ore infla tion climbs to  3¾ percent  by 2013.  In  
response, t he federal funds rate rises  more rapidly than in the staff projection and reaches  
5½ percent  by 2015.  The higher NAIRU and the more restrictive monetary  policy imply  
an appreciably slower  fall in  the unemployment rate —to only 7½ percent at the end of  
2015.      
Further  Disinflation  
Of course, the inflation outlook remains subject to downside risks as well.  In the  
baseline, inflation remains relatively stable over the next several  years and then edges up  
as unemployment declines in an environment of well-anchored inflation expectations.  
But the stability of various measures of  expected  inflation to date may be  misleading us  
about the potential for further disinflation in a persistently  weak economy.  In thi s 
scenario,  core  inflation falls a bit below ½ percent  by late 2013 and remains  at that level 
thereafter —a decline that is in line with the predictions of some of our forecasting  
equations that do not condition on survey measures of expected inflation.  In addition, 
investors become more concerned about the possibility of  an outcome in which the  
economy  is mired in a weak deflationary state with monetary policy persistently  
constrained by the zero lower bound.  As a  result, bond premiums rise and put upward 
pressure on real long-term interest rates, thereby  modestly damping spending and 
boosting unemployment relative to baseline over the next few  years.  In response to lower  
inflation and greater economic slack, the federal  funds rate remains at its effective lower  
bound until  the middle  of 2013.  In the longer run, monetary policy is sufficiently  
stimulative to bring the unemployment rate eventually below baseline and to check the  
deflationary pressure.

Weaker Recovery 
Our baseline forecast of  continued recovery depends importantly on steady  
improvements in credit availability, consumer  and business confidence, and the  
willingness  of firms  to hire.  In this scenario, however, these further improvements are  
slower to materialize.   These developments  cause risk  aversion to increase,  boosti ng 
precautionary saving by  households  and making  firms more reluctant to boost capital 
spending a  nd increase payrolls.  As a  result, the personal saving rate  climbs to 7 ½ percent  
by the  end of 2012, residential investment is flat , and spending on equipment and 
software rises less rapidly  than in the baseline.  In addition, risk premiums increase,  
putting downward pressure on equity and house prices.  By the  end of 2012, house prices  
are 7 percent below  baseline  while  stock  prices are about 7 percent  below  baseline.   
Under these  conditions, r eal GDP  expands at only  a 2½ percent annual pace over the next  
two year s and labor market conditions stagnate, so that the unemplo yment rate is still 
above 8¾ percent through the end of 2012.  Inflation falls in response to more- persistent 
slack and remains below  baseline through 2015.  Liftoff of the federal funds rate from its  
effective lower bound is  delayed until  early  2014.  
Stronger Expansion  
Overall, recent indicators appear to be consist ent with a  moderate strengthening in 
real activity this  year  and next.   In this scenario, we consider the  risk that a  more robust  
expansion is under way, spurred by a mutually reinforcing dynamic of improved 
optimism, higher spending, greater hiring, and i ncreasing  credit availability.  The 
stronger activity and improved optimism buoy financial markets  and push equity prices  
about 11 percent above baseline by the end of this year.  This virtuous circle causes  real  
GDP  to expand 4½ percent  this year  and 5½ percent in 2012, bringing  the unemployment 
rate down to 6¾ percent  by late 2012.  With less slack, inflation is higher; however, the  
upward pressure on prices is partially checked by  more capital deepening, and thus by  
larger productivity  gains, which hold down unit labor costs.  Under these conditions, the  
federal funds rate lifts off this  year,  rising to almost 2 percent by the  end of  2012, and 
remains above baseline thereafter.  
Greater Geopolitical Risks  
Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa  could intensify in coming months, 
reducing  global oil supplies and prompting  further  increases  in oil prices.  With global 
economic and political prospects more uncertain, investors could become less willing to

hold risky assets, potentially leading them to withdr aw capital from both the EMEs and 
the financially vulnerable economies in Europe’s periphery.  To capture this possibility, 
this scenario assumes that oil prices rise 30 percent above baseline by the  end of this  year  
before  gradually receding, corporate bond spreads rise about 100 basis points above  
baseline in the EMEs and peripheral  Europe, and the broad real dollar  appreciates  
5 percent because of  flight- to-safety  effect s.  In response, real activity is weaker than  
baseline as higher oil prices restrain  consumer spending a  nd business investment, and as  
dollar appreciation and weaker  foreign activity dampen real net  exports.  All told, growth 
in U.S. real GDP  is  only 2¾ percent in 2011, and the unemployment rate  remains above  
8½ percent th rough most of 2012, about 1 percentage point higher than in our baseline.  
Core inflation falls to about ¾ percent in 2012, as the positive impact of higher oil prices  
on core inflation is more  than offset by sharply lower U.S. real activity and a stronger  
dollar.   
OUTSIDE FORECASTS  
An updated Blue Chip forecast  will be released  on March 10, and we will  
circulate  a note to the Committee then summarizing its results.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
