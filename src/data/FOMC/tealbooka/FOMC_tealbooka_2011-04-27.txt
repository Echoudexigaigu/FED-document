Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received in r ecent weeks suggests that the recovery in 
economic activity is proceeding at a somewhat slower pace than we had projected in the 
March Tealbook.  In particular, both private and public construction spending fell in the 
first few months of the year by considerably more than we expected, and federal defense 
purchases dropped sharply in the first quarter , though a large part of  that shortfall is 
probably transitory.  Consumer spending in th e first quarter appears to have proceeded 
about as expected, but weak readings on consumer sentiment have caused us to temper 
the acceleration in spending that we expect in coming months.  In contrast, gains in 
business outlays on equipment and software (E&S) remain robust, and forward-looking 
indicators of business conditions continue to be upbeat.  In addition, we remain 
encouraged by the ongoing improvements in the labor market and by factory output, which posted a robust gain in the first quarter .  Taken together, the available information 
points to an increase in real GDP of roughly 2½ percent at an annual rate in the first half 
of 2011, about 1 percentage point below our forecast in the previous Tealbook. 
Although the key background factors shaping our forecast—such as equity and 
house prices, oil prices, the ex change value of the dollar,  and monetary and fiscal 
policy—are not much different,  on balance, than in our pr evious projection, the weaker-
than-expected data for spending have le d us to trim our medium-term outlook for 
economic activity.  Nevertheless, we project th at real GDP will increas e at an annual rate 
of 4 percent over the second half of 2011 and 4¼ percent in 2012.  As in recent 
Tealbooks, the economic recovery is projected to be supported by accommodative monetary policy, increasing cred it availability, the waning e ffects of earlier declines in  
wealth, and improving household and business confidence.  We view the pace of the 
expansion as sufficient to reduce the unemplo yment rate to 7¾ percent by the end of 
2012.  
We have raised our forecast for inflation relative to the March Tealbook in 
response to higher-than-expected incoming da ta on consumer prices, along with small 
upward revisions to the projec ted paths of oil and other imported goods prices.  In 
particular, we now expect core  PCE price inflation to rise  almost 1½ percent in both 2011 
and 2012, about ¼ percentage point above our  previous projection.  Folding in our

forecast for a large jump in food and energy prices in 2011, we project that overall PCE 
prices will rise 2¼ percent th is year and then decelerate  to about 1¼ percent in 2012. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
As in the March Tealbook, we assume that the FOMC will hold the target federal 
funds rate in the current range of 0 to ¼ percent until the third quarter of 2012 and begin 
raising the target rate at the September meeting.  Regarding nontraditional monetary 
policy, we continue to assume that the Fede ral Reserve will expand its holding of longer-
term Treasury securities through the end of the current quarter but will not undertake any 
additional expansion of the balance sheet over th e rest of this year.  We now assume that 
the FOMC will commence a gradual and transparent removal of policy accommodation 
by stopping the reinvestment of principal payments from its securities holdings in 
December 2011.  This cessation of reinvestment is about half a year earlier than we 
assumed in the March Tealbook, resulting in a slightly smaller balance sheet in 2012 than we projected in the previous round.   
Financial Conditions  
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities  has declined about 15 basis points, on 
net, since the March Tealbook, but we have ca rried forward only a portion of this decline 
into the next few quarters.  We continue to  expect the 10-year Treasury yield to increase 
about 1 percentage point by the end of 2012, primarily reflecting the movement of the 
valuation window through the projected period of  near-zero short-term  interest rates.  
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds a nd interest rates on fixed-rate conforming 
home mortgages have been revised down about in line with the modest revisions to yields 
on longer-term Treasury securities  over the next few quarters. 
The level of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index is about 1.5 percent 
lower than we anticipated in the March T ealbook, and we have adjusted the projected 
path of equity prices down by nearly th at amount throughout the medium term.  The 
equity premium remains well above longer-r un norms, and we expect it to decline 
gradually toward a more typical level.  Thus, we expect stock prices to increase at an 
annual rate of about 9 percen t over the projection period. 
According to the latest data from CoreL ogic, home prices decreased 1½ percent in 
February, a weaker reading than we had anticipated.  In re sponse, we have trimmed our

forecast over the projection period and now exp ect home prices to decrease 4½ percent in 
2011—1 percentage point weaker than in our March projection—and to be flat in 2012. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are li ttle changed in this projection.1  We continue 
to expect federal fiscal policy actions to be a neutral influence on aggregate demand in 
2011, as the impetus from the one-year cut in pa yroll taxes and the full expensing 
allowance for business investment is offset by a reduction in stimulus-related grants to 
state and local governments.  In 2012, federal fi scal policy is anticipat ed to impose a drag 
of about 1 percent of GDP as  the payroll tax cuts lapse,  the Emergency Unemployment 
Compensation program is phased out, the stimulus grants for states and localities are 
essentially exhausted, real fe deral purchases are restraine d, and the expensing provision 
for business investment is scaled back. 
As in the March projection, we expect the budget deficit to reach $1.4 trillion 
(9 percent of GDP) in fiscal 2011 and th en narrow to $1.1 trillion in fiscal 2012 
(7 percent of GDP), primarily reflecting th e further tapering off of stimulus-related 
policies and the higher revenues associated with a faster pace of economic activity.  
Correspondingly, federal debt is projected to ri se to over 70 percent of GDP by the end of 
fiscal 2012. 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Recent information on economic activity abroad has generally been stronger than 
we had expected, with foreign real GDP estimat ed to have increased at an annual rate of 
4 percent in the first quarter , about ½ percentage point hi gher than in our previous 
forecast.  Looking ahead, we expect the effects of the March 11 earthquake in Japan to  
shave about ½ percentage point  from aggregate foreign growth in the current quarter, 
pushing the rate down to 2¾ percent.  Most of the downward revision is in the forecast 
for Japan itself, but Japan’s trading partners, particularly in emerging Asia, will likely see 
somewhat weaker output because of a decl ine in exports to Japan as well as some 
disruptions to supply chains.  These effects are assumed to fade over the course of this 
1 Although the advertised size of the cuts to disc retionary budget authority in the recent budget 
agreement is larger than wh at we had assumed in our previous for ecast, we, like the CBO, expect that only 
a small portion of those reductions will show through to spending within the projection period.  As a result, 
the anticipated effect of the budget deal on federal purchases is similar to what we had assumed in the 
March Tealbook.

year, and foreign GDP is projected to expa nd at an average annua l rate of 3½ percent 
over the rest of the forecast period, li ttle changed from the March Tealbook.  
The foreign exchange value of  the do llar in real terms is currently about ½ percent 
lower than we had projected at the time of the March forecast.  From this lower starting 
point we assume that the dollar will depreciate  at an annual rate of about 3 percent over 
the forecast period, a pace that is little change d from what we had written down in March. 
Most of the dollar’s projected  decline occurs against the currencies of the emerging 
market economies.  
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
Amid considerable volatilit y, oil prices have moved up only slightly, on net, since 
the March Tealbook, with the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil 
closing on April 19 at $108 per barrel.  The price of crude oil fell sharply following the 
March 11 earthquake in Ja pan but then recovered as initial fears of an  even more serious 
impact on Japanese economic activity receded.  Oil prices were also boosted in early  
April by news that the disruption of Libyan pr oduction is likely to be more prolonged 
than initially thought and by evidence that ot her members of OPEC, contrary to earlier 
reports, have not significantly increased pr oduction to offset the Libyan shortfall.  
Consistent with futures prices, we project th at the spot price of WTI will remain near 
$108 per barrel through the end of 2011 and th en ease to about $106 by the end of 2012; 
this projected path for oil prices is ab out $1.50 higher than in the previous Tealbook. 
Nonfuel commodity prices, on average, are roughly unchanged since the March 
Tealbook, although many individual commodities have experienced sharp swings.  As 
with oil, prices for many other commoditie s fell in the immediate aftermath of the 
earthquake in Japan but subsequently bounced  back.  Among individual commodities, 
corn prices have recorded part icularly large gains in response  to further news about tight 
inventories in the United States; nevertheless, given the reported intentions of U.S. 
farmers to substantially increase acreage devot ed to corn and other crops, it would appear 
that futures markets expect this tightness in s upply to ease later this  year as stocks are 
replenished.  Going forward, we project that commodity prices for both food and metals will remain near their current elevated le vels, consistent with quotes from futures 
markets.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
The incoming data have led us to mark down our outlook for economic activity in 
the first half of 2011.  We now  estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of 
1¾ percent in the first quarter,  1½ percentage points below our previous projection.  In 
large part, the downward revisi on reflects a combination of un expectedly sharp declines 
in outlays for private and public construction and weaker-than-antici pated federal defense 
purchases.  In the second quarter, we still expect real GDP to accelerate, though now only 
to a 3 percent pace, about ¾ percentage point below our previous projection.  Part of this downward revision is attributable  to the effects of the even ts in Japan on U.S. economic 
activity, mainly in the motor vehicle sector.  However, we also marked down our forecast for consumer spending in response to the recen t retrenchment in consumer sentiment, and 
we carried forward some of the first-quarter weakness in construction spending.   
The Labor Market  
Consistent with our expectations in the March Tealbook, the labor market has 
continued to improve gradually.  Private nonfarm payrolls increased 230,000 in March 
and rose about 190,000 per month on average in the first quarter, up from 150,000 per month in the fourth quarter.  In addition, the unemployment rate declined further in 
March to 8.8 percent.  Other informati on, including initial claims for unemployment 
insurance and indicators of hi ring plans, point to further j ob gains at a roughly similar 
pace in coming months.  Accordingly, our proj ection calls for private payrolls to rise  
220,000 per month, on average, in the second quarter (unchanged from our previous 
projection) and for the unemployment rate to remain near its current level through June.  
The Industrial Sector 
Indicators of industrial activ ity have remained quite positive.  In the first quarter, 
total industrial production (IP) rose at a robust annual rate of 6 percen t, led by a 9 percent 
jump in manufacturing output.  Total moto r vehicle assemblies increased 700,000 units to 
an annual rate of 8.5 million units in the fi rst quarter, while production gains elsewhere in 
manufacturing were widespread  across industries.  With r eadings from the new-orders 
diffusion indexes in the nationa l and regional surveys of purchasing managers still quite 
elevated, we project that total IP will rise at a solid 5½ pe rcent pace in the second quarter.  
The natural disaster in Ja pan is disrupting supply chains for the U.S. motor 
vehicle industry and is a dding uncertainty to the ou tlook for the output of high-

technology products.  Because of shortages of specialized com ponents imported from 
Japan, the staff’s assumption for total motor vehicle assemblies in the second quarter—an 
annual rate of 8.5 million units—is about 350,000 un its lower than it would be otherwise; 
production will be further impeded if parts manufacturers are unable to achieve normal 
operations soon.  In the high-tec hnology sector, we expect the cris is in Japan to have little 
direct effect on near-term U. S. production, but the outlook beyond the current quarter is 
less certain.  Inventorie s of electronic components were re latively high at the time of the 
disaster, mitigating the near-term disruption to  U.S. production.  However, if plants in  
Japan do not come fully on line soon, shorta ges of some of these components may 
develop as the manufacture of  electronics using those comp onents ramps up in the third 
quarter ahead of the holiday season.2  Moreover, production of certain critical 
components, such as raw silicon wafers, is hi ghly concentrated in the affected region of 
Japan.  If production of these components is not restored by about midyear, serious chokepoints may develop.  The supply chain disruptions already have led to upward 
pressure on prices for some  components, but these effects have been damped somewhat 
by increased production activity elsewher e in the global supply network.   
Household Spending 
We continue to view the recovery in  consumer spending as proceeding at a 
moderate pace.  The data we have in hand sugge st that real PCE rose at an annual rate of 
2½ percent in the first quarte r, the same as our projection in the March Tealbook.  In 
addition, we continue to exp ect real PCE to pick up mode stly over the next several 
months, as labor income strengthens, the si zable income boost from the payroll tax cut 
continues to feed through to spending, negative wealth effe cts wane further, and credit 
conditions continue to improve.  However, sh arp increases in food and energy prices are 
eroding a greater portion of the nominal gains in  disposable income than we had expected 
previously, and they also appear to have weighed on consumer confidence, which 
dropped markedly in March and only edged up in April.  As a result, we trimmed our 
forecast for real PCE growth in the second quart er to 3 percent, ½ percentage point below 
our projection in the previous Tealbook. 
2 There is still considerable uncertainty about when the plants in the affected region of Japan will 
return to full operation.  Several facilities were in the course of ramping up production when a large 
aftershock on April 7 led them to shut down again.  Maintaining a steady power supply, which is 
particularly critical for the production of semiconductors, has been a lingering problem.

The recent data on home sales and construction suggest the housing market is on 
an even weaker trajectory than we were pr ojecting in March.  Sale s of new single-family 
homes fell sharply in Februar y, and resales declined, on net,  in February and March.  
Single-family housing starts averaged 410,000 un its in the first quarter and were down 
noticeably from the pace in the fourth quarter.  With the considerable overhang of vacant 
homes evidently still weighing quite heavily on the sector, we marked down our forecast 
for starts in the second quarter to an av erage pace of 420,000, about 40,000 less than our 
forecast in the March Tealbook.  Starts of mu ltifamily units, which also dropped back in 
February, firmed only a little in March.  However, rental demand for these units 
reportedly has picked up recently, and anecdotes  from builders suggest that construction  
in this segment of the market is turning up; as a result, we left  our near-term projection 
for this sector essentially unrevised.  In all,  we now estimate that residential investment 
declined at an annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter, and we exp ect it to be about flat 
this quarter; in the March Tealbook we had pr ojected gains averaging a 5½ percent pace 
during the first half of the year. 
Business Investment 
Real business investment in E&S is expect ed to rise at a r obust annual rate of 
about 11 percent over the first half of the year.  Spending on transportation equipment is on track to post a sizable rebound from the drop that occurred at the end of last year, and 
outlays for other types of equipment should re gister solid gains as firms continue to 
replace aging capital, resume investment pr ojects that were postponed during the crisis, 
and expand capacity in response to rising sa les.  Available indi cators support this 
projection.  Recent gains in shipments have be en widespread across industries, and while 
overall orders dropped back in February, they have continued to run ahead of shipments.  
In addition, survey measures of business sentiment and capital spending plans remain quite positive, borrowing cost s are generally low, analysts ’ earnings expectations for 
producers of capital goods continue to predic t solid growth, and anecdotal reports from 
equipment manufacturers remain upbeat.   
By contrast, the near-term outlook for investment in nonresidential structures has 
grown even darker, as the recent data on c onstruction expenditures suggest a steeper 
decline in real spending in the first quarter th an we had previously projected.  Outlays for 
power-generating structures appear to have plunged in the first quarter following the end-
of-year expiration of a renewable-energy tax incentive, and spending on other types of 
buildings has continued to trend down.  As a result, we have marked down our forecast

for building construction in the second quarter  as well.  The outlook is more positive for 
drilling and mining structures, where elev ated energy prices should sustain solid 
increases in expenditures in coming months.  All told, we now proj ect that spending for 
real nonresidential structures will decline at an a nnual rate of about 10 percent over the 
first half of the year, comp ared with a decline of about  5¾ percent in the previous 
Tealbook. 
After slowing sharply in th e fourth quarter, real n onfarm inventory investment 
appears to have picked up to a moderate pace in the first quarter.  Motor vehicle 
inventories were drawn down more  slowly last quarter than in the fourth quarter, while 
the available data suggest that the pace of stockbuilding outside of  motor vehicles has 
moved up somewhat.  Overall, both the Census Bureau’s book-value data and the staff’s 
flow-of-goods system suggest that inventories are well aligned with th e pace of sales.  
One exception is motor vehicles, where inventories are quite lean and are likely to remain 
so through the second quarter given the disruptio ns to the supply chain from the disaster 
in Japan.  Altogether, we think nonfarm inve ntory investment boosted real GDP growth 
about 1 percentage point in the first quarter a nd that it will subtract ¼ percentage point in 
the current quarter.  Our estimate of the trans itory effects of the disa ster in Japan on U.S. 
motor vehicle production and inventories can more than account for the negative 
contribution from inventory invest ment in the current quarter.  
Government 
Spending data from the Monthly Treasury Statement, which tend to be volatile, 
suggest that total real federal purchases fell at  an annual rate of more than 11 percent in 
the first quarter, with the w eakness concentrated in defense spending.  However, we 
expect real federal purchases  to rebound at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second 
quarter, as defense spending returns to a le vel more consistent with appropriations. 
The incoming information on the state and local sector has been markedly weaker 
than expected.  Real state and local purchase s are currently estimated to have decreased 
at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent in the first quarter of this year—about twice the pace 
of decline projected in the March Tealbook.  While this drop in total spending primarily 
reflects a sizable step-down in expenditure s for construction, th ese governments also 
trimmed employment during the previous quarter by an average of 28,000 jobs per 
month.  In the second quarter, we expect real state and local purchases to decrease at an

annual rate of about 1 percent, as states and localities make further cutbacks in 
construction spending and employment.  
Foreign Trade 
Exports in February came in weaker than we had expected across a broad range of 
categories.  As a result, we now estimate  that real exports of goods and services 
decelerated to an annual growth rate of  6½ percent in the first quarter, nearly 
6 percentage points weaker than projecte d in the March Tealbook.  We believe this 
slowdown is likely to have been temporary and project that exports will pick back up to 
an 8½ percent pace in the current quarter, supported by solid foreign real activity and 
dollar depreciation.  We revised down a bit ou r forecast for export growth in the current 
quarter, reflecting the likely e ffect of economic disruptions from the earthquake in Japan 
on foreign demand for U.S. goods. 
We estimate that real imports expanded at  a moderate 4½ percent rate in the first 
quarter after falling sharply in the fourth; we expect real imports to accelerate to a 
7½ percent rate of growth in the current quarter.  We revised down our first quarter 
estimate by 3½ percentage points,  largely reflecting soft in coming data on oil imports.  
We also revised down our projection for the cu rrent-quarter increase in imports primarily 
because of anticipated disruptions to  automobile imports from Japan.   
For the first half of the year , we expect the external se ctor’s contribution to real 
GDP growth to be about neutral:  Compared with the March Tealbook, our estimate of 
the contribution has been revised down slightly in the first quarter but is little changed in 
the current quarter.    
Prices and Wages 
We raised our near-term inflation forecas t this round and now project that total 
PCE prices will increase at an annual rate of 3¾ percent in the first quarter and 
2¾ percent in the second, about ½ percentage  point higher in both cases than in our 
previous projection.  In part, the upward revision to our near -term price forecast reflects 
higher-than-expected readings on consumer  food and energy prices.  However, the 
monthly data on core consumer prices have also been a little higher than we were 
anticipating, and we now estimate that core  PCE price inflation moved up to an annual 
rate of almost 1½ percent last quarter—about  ¼ percentage point higher than in our 
previous projection—from what we  had judged to be a transito rily low rate of ½ percent 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook

in the fourth quarter of last year.  With import and commodity prices rising further and 
with tight supplies likely putting some additional upward pressure on motor vehicle 
prices, we raised our projection for core inflation in the sec ond quarter to 1½ percent as 
well.  
Median year-ahead inflation expectations  from the Mich igan survey jumped to 
4.6 percent in March and held at that elevated level in early April.  Median 5-to-10-year-
ahead inflation expectations, which popped up to 3.2 percent in March, fell back to 
2.9 percent in early April.  (See the box “H ousehold Inflation Expectations and Food and 
Energy Prices” for further discussion.)  Mean while, the TIPS-based measure of the five-
year forward rate of inflation compensation has edged up since the March Tealbook.   
We have received little information on labor compensation since the previous 
projection.  Average hourly earnings for March came in somewhat below our 
expectations, and we lowered our projection for the increase in the Productivity and Cost 
measure of nonfarm hourly compensation in the first quarter of 2011 to an annual rate of 
2¾ percent, about ¼ percenta ge point below the March Tealbook projection.  As in 
previous Tealbook forecasts, we estimate that the first-quarter increase in hourly 
compensation was temporarily boosted by an in crease in employer contributions to state 
unemployment insurance funds, and we projec t that the growth of hourly compensation 
will slow to about 1¾ percen t in the second quarter.  
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
In our medium-term outlook, we carried forw ard the lower level of real GDP into 
the second half of this year and also ma rked down the rate of growth in 2012 by 
¼ percentage point.  Real GDP is now projected  to increase at an annual rate of 4 percent 
over the second half of 2011 and 4¼ percent in 2012, leaving the level of real GDP at the 
end of 2012 about ¾ percent below the previous forecast.  We have carried forward some  
of the near-term weakness in construction ac tivity.  In addition, over the medium term 
these negative influences are amplified by follow-on effects to aggregate income and 
output.  However, we have been persuaded by the recent solid readings on labor market activity and on industrial production not to dow ngrade the outlook more substantially.  
The broad factors shaping the contour of our forecast are much the same as in the 
March Tealbook and suggest a continued cycl ical rebound in economic activity that is 
subpar relative to the depth of the recession.  We still expect economic activity to

Household Inflation Expectations and Food and Energy Prices                
The  median  year‐ahead   inflation  expectations   from  the  Michigan   survey  jumped  
noticeably   in  March  and  remained   high  in  early  April.   The  median  5‐to‐ 10‐year‐ ahead  
expectations   also  moved  up  a  little  in  March,  though  that  rise  was  reversed   in  early  April  
(see  the  top  and  middle  figures   on  the  facing  page).   Here  we  examine  the  extent  to  
which   these  movements   in  household   expectations   have  been  driven  by  the  sizable  
increases   in  consumer   food  and  energy  prices  seen  in  recent  months.  
Simple  regression   models  that  key  off  of  movements   in  consumer   food,  energy,   and  core  
prices  can  explain  a  significant   proportion   of  the  variation  in  Michigan   survey  measures,   
as  demonstrated   by  simulated   values  from  two  such  models  (the  red  lines  in  the  top  and  
middle  figures).1   In  these  models,   the  consumer   food  and  energy  terms   explain  a  large  
fraction  of  the  variation  in  the  expectations   measures.    For  example,   a  model  that   
includes  only  lags  of  food  and  energy  price  inflation  can  explain  about  two‐thirds  of  the  
variation  of  the  year‐ ahead  measure  since  1998,  considerably   more  than  a  model  that  
includes  only  lags  of  core  price  inflation.    The  5‐to‐10‐year‐ ahead  measure  has  been  quite  
stable  in  recent  years,  and  less  of  its  variation  is  explained   by  simple  models;  
nevertheless,   a  model  that  includes  only  lags  of  consumer   food  and  energy  price  inflation  
can  still  explain  about  40  percent   of  the  variation  in  the  longer‐run  measure.   
From  time  to  time,  the  year‐ahead  expectations   measure—and   to  a  much  lesser  extent,  
the  longer‐run  measure—jump   noticeably.    These  jumps  have  often  been  associated   with  
sharp  increases   in  consumer   food  and  energy  prices  (shown  in  the  bottom  figure  on  the  
facing  page,   with  periods  of  especially   large  increases   in  food  or  energy  prices  
highlighted   in  yellow).2   Indeed,  the  model  captures  a  substantial   portion  of  the  spikes  in  
year‐ ahead  expectations   that  occurred   in  2005  (following   Hurricane   Katrina),  in  2008,  and  
in  the  current  period.   However,   at  other  times  the  movements   in  expectations   are  more  
difficult  to  explain.   For  example,   the  expectation   measures   jumped  in  2006  when  the  
model  did  not  expect  them  to,  given  the  offsetting   moves  in  consumer   food  and  energy  
prices;  conversely,   expectations   did  not  jump  as  the  model  expected   them  to  in  the  first  
half  of  2007,  when   both  consumer   food  and  energy  prices  rose  appreciably.  
Whether  well  explained   or  not,  since  the  mid‐1990s  the  previous  large  jumps  in  
expectations   have  tended  to  be  transitory,   and  given  the  staff’s  projected   paths  for  food  
and  energy  prices,  we  expect  that  to  be  the  case  this  time  as  well.   Indeed,  the  early  April  
reading  on  the  longer‐run  expectations   measure  is  encouraging   in  that  regard. 
1 In the models, the consumer food and energy price inflation terms are multiplied by their time
varying expenditure shares. Interestingly, household expectations are better correlated with 
movements in food and energy prices that are not seasonally adjusted, and these prices are used in the 
models. It may not be a coincidence that the temporary jumps in household expectations in recent 
years have often occurred in the spring, when there is a seasonal increase in gasoline prices. 
2 In particular, a large price increase is defined as a share weighted three month change that is 
2 standard deviations above its mean over the period from 1998 to the present.

accelerate this year and next as the drag from earlier declines in wealth diminishes, 
lending standards ease further, the labor market gradually recovers, and household and 
business confidence continues to recuperate.  Partly offsetting these positive influences 
on our forecast, however, are a large overhang of vacant residential and nonresidential  
properties, the waning of federal fiscal st imulus, and budgetary pressures on state and 
local governments.   
Consumer spending is expected to acceler ate slow ly over the projection period for 
the same reasons as described earlier for the overall forecast.  We expect that real PCE 
will rise 3 percent over the second half of 2011, a somewhat slower pace than in the 
March Tealbook, reflecting our judgment that the rise in energy and food prices will 
continue to weigh on household purchasing power and consumer sentiment for a while longer.  However, PCE growth is then projected to pick up to a 3¾ percent pace in 2012 as consumer confidence recovers and the drag from past declines in  wealth continue to 
wane.  As in the previous Tealbook, the payr oll tax cut boosts dis posable income this 
year; because household spending responds only gradually to the extra income, some of 
the tax cut shows through to th e saving rate this year.  Afte r the tax cuts expire in 2012, 
the saving rate drops back to 5½ percent.   
Business outlays for E&S are projected to  rise at a solid pace over the medium  
term.  In particular, we anticipate that real E&S spending will increa se at an annual rate 
of 13 percent over the se cond half of 2011, primarily supported by the ongoing 
replacement of aging capital,  the resumption of projects deferred during the recession, 
and the need to expand capacity amid impr oving sales prospects.  In 2012, we expect 
growth to slow to about 9 pe rcent, as pent-up demand for investment is worked off. 
In contrast, we expect that weakness in the private construction sector will 
continue to restrain the economic recovery over the medium term; indeed, the latest 
information suggests that this restraint will be even greater than we had anticipated in the 
March Tealbook.  In the residential sector, st ill-tight credit conditions and a voluminous 
inventory of vacant homes continue to weigh on house prices and new construction, and we now think that single-family housing star ts will move up to an annual rate of only 
560,000 units by the end of 2012—100,000 units less than in our previous projection— 
despite the noticeable improvements we exp ect to see in income and employment over 
the forecast period.  In the nonresidential sect or, we anticipate that a steep decline in 
structures investment in early 2011 will give wa y to a fairly flat investment profile later

continue to damp private nonresidential buildi ng activity in coming quarters, and 
although the market for commercial mortgage -backed securities has improved recently, 
financing for new projects, which largely comes from banks, remains tight.   Meanwhile, 
high energy prices are expected to continue to boost investment in drilling and mining 
structures, but to a markedly lesser degree than was the case in 2010.   
Real federal purchases are projected to d ecelerate from a 5 percent rise in 2010 to 
small declines in 2011 and 2012.  The slowdow n reflects anticipated reductions in 
spending related to military operations, th e phasing out of stimulus-related nondefense 
spending, and the tightened environment for di scretionary appropriations.  In the state 
and local sector, we project that total real  purchases by these governments will fall more 
than 1 percent in 2011—a somewhat steeper decl ine than previously pr ojected in light of 
the weaker outlook for construction spe nding—and then only edge up in 2012.  Although 
state and local budgets are expected to be bol stered by further gains in tax receipts over 
the projection period, the phase-out of federal stimulus grants will partially offset the 
anticipated increases in tax revenues.  
Continued dollar depreciation and robust foreign economic activity should 
support real exports of goods and services in  the medium term; in our forecast, exports 
expand at an average annual rate of about 9 percent in the second half of 2011 and in 
2012.  Real imports are projected to rise at a 4¾ percent pace, on average, over the same 
period, as the effect of expa nding domestic real activity outweighs the drag from the 
depreciating dollar.  In all, net exports are expected to cont ribute positively to real GDP 
growth over the projection pe riod, adding about ½ percentage  point to growth in the 
second half of 2011 and in 2012.  This projection is slightly stronger than in the March 
Tealbook, as the lower value of the dollar boosts  exports and lowers imports and as the 
weaker outlook for U.S. economic ac tivity further restrains imports.

Analysis.3  As a result, our assumptions for st ructural productivity growth and for 
potential GDP growth are 0.1 percentage poi nt lower in each year from 2010 to 2012.  
We continue to assume that the NAIRU will remain at 6 percent though 2012.4   
Productivity and the Labor Market 
Given the available data on hours worked and our estimate of real GDP growth, 
we now estimate that labor productivity rose at an annual rate of only ¾ percent in the 
first quarter following a gain of about 3 percent in the f ourth quarter.  The relatively 
small first-quarter increase reduced, but did not eliminate, the estimated degree to which 
the actual level of produc tivity currently stands above its structural le vel.  We expect the 
gap between the levels of actual and structural productivity to na rrow further over the 
medium term as firms add workers both to meet rising production needs and to relieve 
pressures on their existing workforces.  Our forecast therefore calls for payroll 
employment gains to pick up steadily over th e projection period and for the growth of 
actual labor productivity to average 1¾ percent over the se cond half of 2011 and in 2012, 
a little below our estimate of its structur al growth rate of about 2 percent. 
Our forecast for the labor market is slight ly softer than in the March Tealbook, in 
line with the softer profile of real GDP growt h.  In particular, we now  project that private 
em
ployment gains will step up from an average pace of 200,000 per month in the first 
half of 2011 to 250,000 per month in the s econd half of 2011 and 275,000 per month in 
2012; the gains in the second half of 2011 and in 2012 are about 20,000 per month less 
than in our previous projection.  Given the tr immed pace of job growth in this projection 
and the unrevised participation rate, the path for the unemployment rate in this forecast is 
a touch higher than in the March Tealbook, ending 2012 at 7¾ percent. 
3 We incorporated new and revised estimates covering 2009 and earlier years for multifactor 
productivity (MFP) and capital services from the Bureau  of Labor Statistics, as well as new capital stock 
data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis for the same period.  The new data led us to lower our estimate 
of the contribution of capital deepening to structural productivity growth from 2009 to 2012.  In addition, the BLS data showed a slightly higher rate of actual MFP growth in 2009, which we passed through to structural MFP growth on the view that the improvements to efficiency that year we re a little larger than we 
had previously assumed.  Because we see the surge in structural MFP in 2009 as reflecting one-time 
influences rather than a higher trend rate of growth, we did not raise the assumed rate of growth in structural MFP for 2010 to 2012. 
4 Our estimate of the “effective” NAIRU, which includes the influence of extended and emergency 
unemployment benefits and is the level of the unemploymen t rate that we view as being consistent with no 
slack in resource utilization, is unrevised from the Ma rch projection and is now about 6½ percent.  As 
before, we expect the effective NAIRU to decline to  around 6 percent by the end of 2012 as the extended 
and emergency unemployment benefit programs expire.

Resource Utilization 
Our estimates of economic slack in this pr ojection are just a little wider than those 
in the March Tealbook.  By our reckoni ng, the unemployment rate is about 
2½ percentage points above the “effective” NAIRU in the current quarter, and at the end 
of next year, the unemployment gap—at 1¾ pe rcentage points—is ne arly ¼ percentage 
point larger than in the prev ious Tealbook.  This extended period of labor market slack is 
likely to be associated with other features of a weak labor market, including below-trend 
labor force participation, a high percentage of workers who are involuntarily on part-time 
schedules, and an unusually la rge concentration of worker s experiencing long-duration 
unemployment spells.  Similarly, the downward revision we made to the path for 
potential output was smaller th an the downward revision to real  GDP over the          
2011–12 period, leaving the output gap by th e end of 2012 at 3½ percent, about 
½ percentage point wider than in the previ ous forecast.  In the manufacturing sector, 
capacity utilization rises appr eciably over the projection pe riod, and unlike the broader 
measures of economic slack, it tightens a bit fast er than in the previous forecast.  (See the 
box “Capacity Utilization in the Manufacturing Sector” for further discussion.) 
Compensation and Prices 
Despite the slightly greater amount of labor market slack  in this projection, we 
nudged up our forecast of hourly labor compensation in response to our projection of higher headline inflation.  We now project that the Productivity and Costs measure of 
nonfarm hourly compensation will increase 2¼ percent in 2011 and 2¾ percent in 2012, a 
touch more in each year than we projected  in the March Tealbook.  We have made a 
similar upward adjustment to our forecast for the employment cost index over this period.  
The projected increases in compensation, combined with the downward revision to 
productivity growth this year, imply a larger increase in unit labor co sts over the medium  
term than in the March Tealbook, though at an annual rate of about 1 percent, that 
increase remains quite modest. 
Prices for imported core goods (all goods  excluding fuels, computers, and 
semiconductors) are estimated to have increased  at an annual rate of 8¼ percent in the 
first quarter, reflecting the rise  in commodity prices, elevat ed foreign inflation, and the 
depreciation of the dollar.  We expect core import price inflation to slow to 5¾ percent in 
the current quarter and then to ease further to 1½ percent in 2012 as commodity prices 
level out, foreign inflation subsid es, and dollar depreciation slows.

Capacity Utilization in the Manufacturing Sector            
During  the  recovery,  economic   slack  in  the  manufacturing   sector  has  been   
narrowing   more  rapidly  than  it  has  for  the  economy   as  a  whole,  and  this  trend  is  
expected   to  continue.    Indeed,  although  the  capacity  utilization   rate  in  
manufacturing   is  currently   well  below  its  long‐run  average,  it  is  projected   to  
move  a  bit  above  that  level  by  the  end  of  the  projectio n  period  (shown  in  the  
figure  below).    Capacity  utilization   is  rising  rapidly  for  two  reasons:   First,  
manufacturing   production   is  rebounding   more  quickly   than  overall  economic  
activity;   second,  manufacturing   capacity  is  expanding   only  modestly—much  
more  slowly,  in  particular,   than  our  estimate  of  potenti al  GDP.  
Inferences   about  aggregate  economic  slack  rely  on  a  measure  of  potential,   which  
typically  is  unobserved.    In  contrast,  the  Federal  Reserve’s  measures   of  
manufacturing   capacity  are  principally   derived  from  data  on  the  reported   
productive  capability   of  individual   manufacturing   plants.1   Importantly,   these  data  
include  information   on  the  operating   status  of  plants—active,   idled,  or  closed— 
which  enables  the  staff  to  remove  from  its  estimates   of  aggregate   capacity  those  
plants  that  are  permanently   closed  as  well  as  idled  plants  that  would  be  quite  
slow  and  costly  to  restart.   For  example,   hot‐idled  steel  furnaces  are  kept  in  
capacity,  while  cold‐idled  furnaces  are  removed,  reflecting   the  considerable   time  
and  expense  associated   with  restarting   them.   Similarly,   an  auto  assembly   plant  
that  is  temporarily   closed  for  a  model‐year   changeover  is  kept  in  capacity  while  a  
plant  that  is  closed  for  a  lengthy  period  for  major  retooling   is  removed.  
1 The primary data source is the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity, which 
is jointly funded by the Federal Reserve Board and the Department of Defense. In the survey, 
plant managers are explicitly asked about full, sustainable productive capability using only the 
equipment in place and ready to use, ignoring labor and material input constraints but 
considering normal downtime and shift patterns.

Following   the  2001  recession,   the  recovery  in  the  manufacturing   sector  was  quite  
sluggish,  as  the  rebound  in  domestic   demand  for  manufactured   goods  was  
mainly  satisfied  by  increases   in  imports.    With   output  growth  lethargic,   producers   
expanded   domestic   capacity  only  slowly.   Reflecting   these   trends,   the  factory  
operating   rate  had  only  just  returned   to  its  long‐run  average  when  the  most  
recent  recession   began.   When  manufacturing   production   plunged  a  total  of  
20  percent  during  2008  and  the  first  half  of  2009,  utilization   rates  fell  to  postwar  
lows,  prompt ing  manufacturers   to  shutter  unproductive   capacity  and  sharply  
curtail  already  weak  capital  spending.    Accordingly,   manufacturing   capacity  
contracted   nearly   2  percent  per  year  over  the  period  from  2008  through  2010  
(shown  in  the  figure  below);   these  large  and  sustained   declines  were  
unprecedented   in  the  history  of  the  series,  which  begins  in  1948.  
Looking  ahea d,  indicators   of  future  capital  spending   suggest  that  manufacturing   
capacity  will  expand  at  an  annual  rate  of  a  little  over  1  percent  this  year  and  next .   
However,  these  anticipated   increases   in  capacity  are  smaller  than  the  continued   
strong  gains  expected   in  manufacturing   production.    As  a  result,  we  project  that  
economic   slack  in  the  manufacturing   sector  will  continue  to  be  taken  up  more  
quickly  than   in  the  rest  of  the  economy.   Rapidly  tightening   resource  availability   
in  the  manufacturing   sector  could  lead  to  production   bottlenecks  and  shortages   
in  some  industries.   While  these  developments   could  put  upward  pressure  on  the  
prices  of  some  manufactured   goods,   we  expect  that  these  effects  would  be  
transitory   and  would  not  be  widespread,   in  part  because   utilization   is  projected   
to  be  only  a  bit  above  its  long‐run  average  by  the  end  of  next  year.   Moreover,   
since  manufacturing   production   accounts   for  only  11  percent  of  overall   domestic  
value  added   and  because  significant   labor   market  slack  remains  in  the  overall   
economy,  we  do  not  expect  the  projected   rapid   increases   in  capacity  utilization   
to  lead  to  appreciable   upward  pressure  on  aggregate  inflation.

We project that core PCE pri ces will rise 1.4 percent both this year and next.  This 
projection is 0.2 percentage point higher in both years than in the March Tealbook, 
reflecting incoming data on core inflation and import prices that have been a touch higher 
than we had anticipated as well as the indir ect effect of some small upward surprises in 
energy prices; these influences outweigh the effe cts of slightly greater slack in resource 
utilization in this proj ection.  As before, the flat contour  of core infla tion between this 
year and next reflects offsetting influences:  With inflation expectations projected to 
remain stable, the anticipated  narrowing of the unemploymen t gap implies a reduction in 
the downward pressure on inflation from resource slack, but we also expect the impetus 
to core inflation from higher import and energy prices to diminish as  we move into next 
year.  Meanwhile, headline PCE price inflation is projected to step down from 2¼ percent 
in 2011 to 1¼ percent in 2012, reflecting the a ssumed flattening of prices for crude oil 
and other raw commodities and the associated deceleration in energy and food prices at 
the consumer level.    
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2015 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assessments of long-run supply- side conditions, fisc al policy, and other factors.  The 
contour of the long-run outlook depe nds on the following key assumptions: 
  Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long 
run, consistent with th e majority of longer-term inflation projections 
provided by FOMC participants  at the January meeting. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities follow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B.  The projected longer-run decline in the 
System’s holdings is forecast to contri bute about 20 basis points to the rise 
in the 10-year Treasury yield over the period from 2013 to 2015.  
  Beyond 2012, risk premiums on corporate equities decline gradually to 
normal levels and banks ease their lendi ng standards somewhat further.   
  The federal government budget deficit narrows to 4½ pe rcent of GDP by 
the end of 2015.  This improvement reflects the effects of the economic recovery on tax receipts and transfer payments as well as further policy 
actions after 2012 aimed at  reducing the deficit.

  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to deprec iate 
½ percent per year from 2013 through 2015.  The price of WTI crude oil is 
roughly flat at about $105 per ba rrel during the extension period, 
consistent with futures prices.  Foreign real GDP expands, on average, 
3¼ percent per year from 2013 thr ough 2015, a bit above its trend rate. 
 The NAIRU declines from 6 percent in late 2012 to 5¼ percent by 2015 as 
the functioning of the labor market improves.  Potential GDP expands 2¾ percent per year.  
The economy enters 2013 with output still well below its potential, the 
unemployment rate well above the projected NAIRU, and inflation below its assumed 
objective.  In the long-run forecast, improvi ng confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and 
supportive financial conditions eventually enab le the level of aggregate demand to catch 
up with aggregate supply.  The real federal funds rate moves up only gradually until 2015, when it finally reaches its historical average value over the past 40 years of 2¼ percent.
5  In this environment, real GDP rises at an average annual rate of 4¼ percent 
in 2013 and 2014, considerably faster than its potential pace; as a re sult, unemployment 
declines appreciably and inflation edges up.  By 2015, with improvements in confidence and financial conditions largely complete, and with the nominal federal funds rate 
climbing further to 3¾ percent, gains in real  GDP are moderate.  Nevertheless, overall 
economic growth remains robust enough relativ e to potential to bri ng the unemployment 
rate close to the NAIRU by late 2015 while core inflation rises to 1¾ percent. 
5 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions of the outcome-based 
rule, which is described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Indicators suggest that the recovery strengthened in the first quarter in both the 
advanced foreign  economies (AFEs)  and the emerging market economies  (EMEs) , but 
recent  events have clouded the near -term outlook.   We estimate that foreign economic 
growth averaged  4 percent  in the first quarter , about ½ percentage point more than in our 
March forecast.   However, t he disaster in Japan  has driven a downward revision to our  
current -quarter forecast  of about ½ percentage point.  This revision includes a substantial  
markdown to Japanese GDP, which is now expected to contract in the  current quarter.  
We also have made small reductions  to the forecast for Japan’s  trading partners, a s their  
exports  to Japan should weaken and some supply  chains  may be  disrupt ed.  As the 
Japanese economy recovers and production constraints ease, aggregate foreign growth 
should rebound in the second half of the  year.  (See the box “Economic Effects of the 
Earthquake  in Japan .”)  
Foreign GDP  is still expected to increase at an  average rate of  about 3½ percent  
over the rest of the forecast period, with growth of  nearly  5 percent in the EMEs and 
almost 2½ percent in the  AFEs.  D ownside risks  to this outlook include a more prolonged 
effect of the  Japanese disaster,  higher oil prices due to intensified  unrest in the Middle  
East  and North Africa, and a more adverse effect  of the softer U.S. economy.  In addition, 
the recent rise in credit spreads  for some peripheral European countries  amid concerns  
about a restructuring of  Greek debt suggests that  associated  risks have not dissipated.  
However, markets  appear to be increasingly differentiating Spain and Italy  from the more  
vulnerable economies, and strong recent indicators suggest that  there may be  some upside  
risk  to our forecast for the euro area  as a whole.   
Foreign i nflation  is expected to ease in the current quarter to around  3¼ percent  
from about 4½ percent in the previous quarter, largely reflecting  a recent slowing in food 
price inflation .  Inflation is expected to average a little less than 2½ percent  over  the rest  
of the forecast period as  commodity prices  flatten out.  China has continued to tighten 
monetary policy  to contain inflation , and policy rates also have risen in a number of other  
EMEs.   Although monetary policy  remains  generally accommodative in the  AFEs, t he 
European Central Bank ( ECB )  began what is expected to be a series  of  gradual rate 
increases on April 7 , and the Bank of England (BOE)  and the  Bank of Canada  (BOC) are 
both expected to rais e  rates later this  year.

Economic Effects of the Earthquake in Japan              
The  earthquake  and  subsequent   tsunami  that  hit  Japan  on  March  11  are  expected   
to  have  a  large  near‐term  effect  on  the  Japanese  economy   and  noticeable   but  
smaller   effects  on  other  foreign  economies,   primarily  in  Asia.   Here  we  discuss  
our  estimates   of  the  economic   effect  on  Japan,  review  spillover  channels   to  
other  economies,  and  identify   key  risks.    
The  disaster  is  reported   to  have  left  nearly  30,000  people  dead  or  missing,  and  
damage  to  physical  capital  is  estimated   at  3  to  5  percent  of  Japan’s  GDP.   The  
areas  directly   hit  by  the  earthquake  and  tsunami  account  for  only  4  percent  of  
Japanese  output.   However,  damage  to  infrastructure  and  power  plants  goes  
well  beyond  the  troubling   nuclear  accident   at  the  Fukushima  Daiichi  plant.   
National  electricity   production   capacity  is  currently   down  10  to  15  percent,  and  
the  resulting  power  shortfall  is  importantly   affecting   the  region  around  Tokyo,  
which  is  responsible  for  about  40  percent  of  the  country’s   GDP.   Rolling  
blackouts   and  damage  to  transportatio n  and  manufacturing   facilities  have  kept  
plants  offline  and  severed  supply  chains.  
The  limited  data   we  have  received  since  the  earthquake  suggest  a  significant   
near‐term  decline  in  Japanese  output   (see  lower‐left  figure).   The  composite  PMI  
for  March  posted  the  largest  monthly  decline  in  the  survey’s  history,  even  
greater  than  those  immediately   after  the  September  11  terrorist  attacks  and  the  
2008  collapse  of  Lehman  Brothers.   An  early  read  on  consumer   confidence   shows  
it  also  falling  in  March.  
Our  views  have  also  been   informed  by  Japan’s  experience  following   the  last  
major   earthquake,   near  Kobe  in  January  1995.   In  1995,  damage  to  the  capital  
stock  was  substantial,  but  the  decline  in  economic   activity  was  limited   and  short‐
lived  (see  lower‐ right  figure).   We  think  that  the  March  11  earthquake  will  have  a  
larger  negative  effect:   The  loss  of  capital   is  estimated   to  be  roughly  twice  that  of  
Kobe,   and  disruption  to  electricity   generation  capacity  is  expected   to  affect  
Tokyo  through  the  summer.

Based  on  incoming   data  and  the  historical   experience,  we  project  flat  GDP  
growth  in  the  first  quarter  and  a  3½  percent  decline  (annual  rate)  this  quarter,   
down  1¾  percentage  points  and  5  percentage  points,  respectively,   from  the  last  
Tealbook.    The  economy   should  start  recovering   rapidly  in  the  third  quarter,  as  
the  nuclear  situation   is  assumed  to  stabilize,   consume r  and  business  confidence   
strengthen,   rebuilding  efforts  begin,  and  macroeconomic   policy  is  supportive.    By  
the  end  of  2012,  the  level   of  GDP  is  just  a  touch  lower  than  that  for  the  March   
Tealbook.    Overall,  our  projection   is  close  to  the  consensus   view  among  
professional   forecasters,  although  the  range  of  forecasts   is  particul arly  wide.  
Dislocations   in   Japan  resulting  from  the  earthquake  are  likely  to  affect  foreign  
economies   through  three   main  channels:    Diminished  Japanese  demand  for  other  
countries’  exports,   lower  foreign  direct  investment   and  portfolio  flows  from  
Japan,  and  disruptions   to  cross‐country  supply  chains.   We  expect  the  first  two  
channels  to  be  fairly  minor,  given  that  Japan  accounts   for  a  relatively   small  share  
of  trade  and  investment   inflows  for  most  countries,  especially   outside  of  Asia.    
Disruptions   to  supply  chains  represent  the  main  concern  at  present.   Some  Asian  
producers,  particularly   in  the  high‐tech  sector,  are  highly  dependent  on  
intermediate  inputs  imported   from  Japan.   However,  although  production  in  
certain  firms  and  sectors   is  being  disrupt ed,  the  aggregate  results  will  likely  be  
limited.   Many  of  the  Japanese  plants  that  shut  down  in  the  aftermath  of  the  
earthquake  are  already  back  on  line,  though  not  yet  at  full  capacity,  and  there  is  
scope  for  resourcing   to  alternative  suppliers.   All  told,  we  expect  the  earthquake  
to  shave  about  ½  percentage  point  from  GDP  growth  in  emerging   Asia  in  the  
second  quarter,  with  this  negative  effect  unwinding   in  the  second  half  of  2011  as  
normalization   in  activity  and  Japanese  reconstruction  increase  demand  for  
industrial   supplies  and  capital  goods.   The  effect  on  GDP  growth  in  the  advanced   
economies   is  likely  to  be  even  smaller,  with  modest  disruptions   reported  to  
production  of  motor  vehicles  in  the  United  States,  Europe,  and  Canada  because  
of  shortages   of  auto  parts  from  Japan.1  
That  said,  considerable   risks  surround   our  estimates   of  the  earthquake’s   effects  
on  Japan  as  well  as  its  trading  partners.    In  particular,   the  situation  at  the  
Fukushima   Daiichi  plant  has  yet  to  stabilize,  and  recent  reports  are  worrisome.    
Moreover,   the  country  continues   to  experience   sizable  aftershocks,   slowing  
recovery  efforts  and  raising  the  possibility   of  further  damage.   These  concerns   
could  weigh  on  consumer   and  business  confidence,   and  hence  economic   activity,  
more  heavily  and  for  longer  than  we  are  currently   anticipating.    Finally,  the  
disruption   to  supply  chains,  both  within  Japan  and  globally,  could  be  larger  and  
more  sustained   than  in  our  baseline,  especially   if  the  bounceback   in  production   is  
not  as  rapid  as  projected.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES   
First-quarter data for the  AFEs were  generally  stronger than we had  expected , 
prompting us to revise up our  GDP  growth estimate by  ¼ percentage point to 2½ percent .  
The economic effect of the massive earthquake  and tsunami w ill be most  apparent in the  
current quarter,  most notably for  the Japanese economy,  although there should also be  
some spillover to the other  AFEs .  These effects are expected  to be  reversed in the second 
half o f the  year as Japanese production rebounds  and the recons truction effort gathers  
speed.  For the AFEs as a whole, w e expect real GDP growth of 1½ percent in the current  
quarter, followed by increases averaging nearly 2½ percent over the rest of the forecas t 
period.  Relative to  the March  Tealbook, our forecast  for the AFEs  is down ½ percentage 
point in the current quarter but is up ¼ percentage point in the second half  of this  year, 
largely reflecting  the pattern of  Japanese activity .  
Inflation was 3 ¼ percent  on average in the  AFEs  in the first quarter , ½ percentage 
point higher than projected in the March Tealbook.  However, we  continue to expect  that 
inflation will drop back to about 1½ percent over the forecast period, as  commodity  
prices stabilize  and mo netary policy outside Japan tighten s.  Core inflation remains  
contained, especially excluding hikes in value-added taxes and other duties.  Subdued 
underlying inflation and continuing resource slack underpin our assumption that central  
banks will remove monetary stimulus only  gradually.  
Japan  
Japan ’s economy appeared to be bouncing back from  its  fourth -quarter lull  before  
being struck by the massive earthquake and tsunami on March 11.  The disaster sharply  
curtailed  economic activity by damaging production facilities, disrupting supply chains, 
and reducing  electricity  generation capacity.   In the near term,  we expect  a rapid  
destocking of inventories and sharp declines in exports and private investment.  In addition, loss of wealth and confidence  is  likely  to weigh on household spending.  
Accordingly, we estimate that real GDP was flat  in the first quarter  and we project a  
3½ percent decline in the second.  Economic  activity should rebound in the second half  
of the year as  electricity is restored,  plants res ume  normal operations, reconstruction 
efforts intensify, and exports and inventories bounce back.  Over time, private investment  
also should pick up, but private consumption will likely remain cautious for an extended  
period.  All told, we forecast real GDP to rise  about ¾ percent in 2011, half the projected  
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook

gain in the March Tealbook, and then to increase at  a 2¾  percent pace in 2012.  W e 
continue to expect  prices  to decline at a ½  percent  pace over this  year  and next.   
We  h ave assume d that the Japanese go vernment ’s  reconstruction effort s will  
boost real GDP  growth ½ percentage point both this  year and next.  The disaster  
preempted Japan’s plans  to reduce its fiscal deficit, which we now  expect to  edge up to 
more than 8 percent  of GDP by  2012.  In addition, t he Bank of Japan (BOJ) has taken a 
series of steps to  support  the financial system and economy.  It quickly injected record 
levels of liquidity into money markets, doubled the size of its asset purchase program to 
¥10 trillion (about $120 billion, or 2 percent of GDP), and, more recently, unveiled a  
¥1 trillion program to foster lending in the disaster -hit areas.  Going f  orward, we  
anticipate the BOJ to further increase its asset purchase program to ¥15  trillion.  
Euro Area  
Recent indicators for the euro area point to an upward shift in economic  growth, 
to 2¼ percent,  in the first quarter.  Industrial production expanded  through February, with 
solid gains recorded in France and  Germany.   Business sentiment has remained upbeat, 
and the composite purchasing managers index (PMI) stands substantially  higher than its  
fourth -quarter average.   However, private consumption indicators—retail sales, consumer  
confidence measures, and new car registrations —have been weak.  Moreover, 
divergences in economic performance across euro -area countries  remain large,  with  
strong cyclical rebounds  in Germany and, to a lesser extent, France, but a  further  
deterioration in economic conditions in Greece and Portugal.  We expect  euro -area GDP  
growth to slow in the current quarter to about 1½ percent  and to stay  in that range for the  
remainder of the year, restrained by  high energy  prices,  monetary and fiscal policy  
tightening, and a stronger euro.  We  anticipate  that  growth  will pick up gradually to 
2½ percent by the  end of  2012 as  financial stresses continue to moderate  and household 
spending  strengthens .   
Euro -area consumer prices rose 2.7 percent in March from their  year- earlier level,  
the fourth consecutive monthly figure  exceeding the ECB’s 2 percent inflation target 
ceiling.   Inflation is expected to ease gradually  to 1¾ percent in 2012 as  commodity  
prices level out and slack persists.   At its April 7 meeting, the ECB raised  its benchmark  
policy rate by 25 basis points to 1¼ percent, the first rate hike since June 2008, and 
furthe r stressed its concerns about upside risks to the inflation outlook.  W e now expect

the ECB to raise its  policy  rate to 2¼  percent by the end of 2012, ¼ percentage point  
more than assumed in the March Tealbook.   
At their meetings in March, European Union (EU) leaders made some progress  
tow
ard establishing stronger crisis resolution frameworks to cope  with the sovereign debt  
crisis.  They pledged to increase the effective lending capacity of the European Financial  
Stability  Facility to €440 billion and agreed upon the final terms of its permanent  
successor, the  European Stability Mechanism, although bot h of these agreem ents will 
require  approval by individual countries.  In addition, they  eased the terms  of existing  
rescue loans to Greece and persuaded the Irish  government to  table its proposal to impose  
losses on bank creditors.  In early April, the Portuguese  government officially requested 
an  EU–IMF  assistance package, which is expected to be roughly €60 billion to € 100 
billion.  Despite pressures on Portugal and increasing discussion about the  possibility of a  
Greek debt restructuring, markets remained less concerned  about the prospects for Spain 
and Italy .  Thus, we  continue to believe that, even if  Greece eventually restructures its  
debt, there will not be significant spillovers to large euro- area countries .  
Canada  
We estimate that r eal GDP  expanded 3¼ percent in the first quarter, up 
¾ percentage point from  the forecast in the March  Tealbook.  Pro duction rose across a 
wide range of industries in January and manufacturing orders perked up, mainly  
reflecting  strong domestic demand.  Production at  several  automobile plants has been 
disrupted by  a shortage of parts in the wake of the Japanese earthquak e, but  the  effect  on 
overall  activity should be small.  We look for GDP growth to step down to around 
2½ percent over the remainder of the forecast period, as  consumption growth is restrained 
by high household debt, although investment should remain strong ,  especially in  
commodity- related sectors.   Headline inflation  leaped  to 3.3 percent in March  on a  
12-month basis, a noticeably higher  figure than we had anticipated.  However, we 
continue to expect that inflation will  fall back close to  the BOC’s 2 percen t target by  
early next  year  as the effects of tax hikes and sharp  increases in energy prices drop out.  
We now  expect the BOC  to gradually  raise its  target for the overnight  rate from 1 percent  
at present to  2¼ percent  by the end of the forecast period , ¼ percentage point more than 
in the March Tealbook.

United Kingdom  
We marked up our estimate of first- quarter  U.K.  GDP growth nearly  
½ percentage point to about  3 percent  in response to strong employment  gains and a  
composite PMI consistent with continued solid  expansion.  We also expect some p  ayback  
from the  weather -related  contraction  in the fourth quarter.  However,  weakening  
consumer confidence and  production disruptions  from  the Japanese ear  thquake led us to 
shave ¼ percentage point  from  GDP growth in the current quarter.   Growth is expected to 
average a little  less than 2½ percent over the rest  of the forecast period, as  strong foreign  
demand spurred by  a weak sterling is offset by  sharp fiscal consolidation.  Headline  
inflation eased to 4 percent in March  but should remain high  for most of this  year before  
dropping rapidly toward the 2 percent target at the  beginning of 2012, a s the effect of tax  
increases  drops out and energy price hikes  wane.  We continue to project that the  BOE  
will begin  raising  its  policy rate  in the third quarter of this  year, and we expect the rate to 
reach  1.75 percent by the end of the forecast period. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES   
We estimate that a ggregate  real GDP  growth in the EMEs  remained robust  in the  
first quarter, averaging nearly 6  percent, ¾ percentage point above our projection in the 
March Tealbook.  On the whole, recent data on industrial production and exports remain 
upbeat.  In the current quarter, we anticipate that  growth will moderate to  4½ percent , 
½ percentage poi nt below our previous forecast , restrained by  the slower  growth  
projected for  the United  States  as well  as the adverse effect s of the earthquake in Japan.  
GDP growth  is expected  to average a little less than  5 percent  for the remainder of the  
forecast per iod, little changed from the previous projection.   
Inflation in  the EMEs  appears to have eased to an  annual rate of 5 ½ percent in the 
first quarter from nearly  7 percent in the  fourth quarter , as  pressures from  food price s 
have lessened .  With  commodity prices  projected to level out, inflation in the EMEs  
should moderate further, to about 3¼ percent by next  year.  
In response to the  recent inflation readings as well as solid economic  growth, a 
number of  EME central banks have tighten ed  monetary policy  further.  We expect that  
central banks  will continue to tighten , albeit at a restrained pace  amid  continued concerns  
about capital inflows, while allowing some moderate currency  appreciation.  The latest 
data on flows to emerging market dedicated funds suggest  that capital inflows into EMEs

have picked up again  in recent weeks  after recording outflows  earlier this  year.  
Authorities in Brazil, Indonesia , and Korea have announced new  capital control measures
since the previous  Tealbook .  (See the box “C apital Controls in E merging Market  
Economies.”)    
China    
Chinese real GDP increased at a rate of nearly 9  percent in the  first quarter,  
supported by strong f  ixed asset investment, down a little from the double- digit pace in the  
second half of last  year.  Robust domestic demand and rising c  ommodity prices  
substantially boosted first- quarter i mports, contributing to a quarterly trade deficit on a 
nonseasonally adjusted basis, the first such deficit  since 2004.  We view this development  
as temporary,  and we still expect China to show substantial trade and current account  
surpluses both this  year and next.  We marked  down GDP growth in the second quarter  
nearly ½  percentage point, owing to disruptions to supply chains and, to a lesser extent, 
decreased demand from Japan  for Chinese exports.  However, t he March  PMI  edged up 
after falling  in the previous three months, and we  continue to project that real GDP  
growth in China will be around 8½ percent through 2012.   
Inflation came in  at an annual rate of  about 4½ percent in  the first quarter, down 
sharply  from 9 percent in the previous quarter, as  prices of the housing component  
slowed, and authorities adjusted the weights of the consumption basket.  (Effective  
January  2011, the new basket reflects a smaller weight on food and a larger  weight on 
housing.)  Chinese inflation is projected to moderate further to about 2¾ percent by the 
beginning of next  year as food price inflation comes off the boil.  Chinese  authorities  
have continued their  gradual tightening of monetary  policy, raising the one-year lending  
and deposit rates ¼ percentage point  and banks’ reserve requirement ratios   
1 percentage point  since the March Tealbook .  Over this period, the authorities also have 
let the renminbi appreciate about ½ percent against the dollar.  The renminbi has now  
appreciated about 4½ percent against the dollar since Chinese authorities  announced 
greater flexibility of the exchange rate last June, although, on a real trade- weighted basis,  
it has depreciated  only about 2½ percent.  We continue to expect the renminbi to 
appreciate gradually  both against the dollar and on a trade- weighted basis over the 
forecast period .

Other Emerging Asia  
Elsewhere in  emerging Asia,  we estimate that economic activity  accelerated in the 
first  quarter  to post a  gain of about 7¼ percent, led by an outsized increase in GDP in 
Singapore.  On the whole, industrial production and PMIs have remained upbeat in recent  
months, and exports were strong in a number of  economies.  We project that  economic 
growth in the regi on will decline to about 3½ percent in the second quarter, before  
picking up again to about 4¾ percent  for the remainder of the forecast period .  We have 
revised down our projection for the current quarter on the negative  effects  of the crisis in 
Japan and  the softness in the U.S. economy, with larger  revisions for  economies with 
greater reliance on  supply chains  and final demand from Japan  (Hong Kong, Singapore, 
Taiwan , and Thailand ).  For the second half of 2011, the outlook is revised up a touch as  
the positive effects of a Japanese  recover y  more than offset the negative effect from  a 
weaker U.S. outlook.     
We  estimate that quarterly  inflation rose to an annual rate of  about 7½ percent in 
the first quarter , mainly  as a result of higher  food prices.  How ever, monthly  data suggest  
that inflation  already  has  begun to recede, as  food price pressures have dissipated across  
most of the region.  We expect  inflation  to moderat e  further to about 3 percent by the  end 
of this  year, partly in response to monetary policy tightening across the region, including  
in India, the Philippines , Singapore, Taiwan , and Thailand.  We also continue to expect  
that central banks  in the  region will allow for some moderate  currency  appreciation in  
line with projected movements in the  renminbi.   
Latin America  
We now  estimate  that real GDP  growth in Mexico  stepped down to 4¼ percent in 
the first quarter,  about ¼ percentage point lower than in the March Tealbook, reflecting  
recent softer readings on industrial production.  We e xpect Mexican  growth to moderate 
further, to about 3½ percent, over the rest of the year , about ½ percentage  point below the  
previous projection, in response  to a weaker forecast for U.S.  manufacturing activity.   
Real GDP growth in South America  is estimated to hav e picked up to about  4¾ percent  
in the first quarter , a little above our previous projection, but is still expected to fall 
gradually to just under 4 percent by  next year  as  monetary policy tightens  across the  
region .  In  Brazil, strong r  ecent data on industrial  production suggest that real GDP  
accelerated in the first quarter.   Brazilian  consumer credit  growth remained robust despite  
ongoing attempts by the  central bank to  curtail the expansion, and exports continued to

Capital Controls in Emerging Market Economies
Private capital inflows to the emerging market economies (EMEs) have surged since mid- 
2009 and have also been quite volatile (see figures below), putting upward pressure on 
currencies and asset prices in recipient countries. In response, a number of governments 
have implemented measures to limit capital inflows and affect their composition. Here 
we provide an overview of recent capital control measures and review the resurgent 
debate regarding their potential effectiveness.
The capital control measures adopted over the past few years are summarized in the 
table on the facing page. Some measures target the overall volume of portfolio and bank 
inflows to curtail currency appreciation and overheating pressures. Examples include 
Brazil’s tax on foreign investments in local securities, and taxes in South Korea and 
Thailand on foreign investors’ interest income and capital gains from holding local 
government bonds.  1  [ F o o t n o t e  1 .  F o r  T h a i l a n d ,  t h e  m e a s u r e  r e m o v e s  t h e  p r e f e r e n t i a l  t r e a t m e n t  o f  f o r e i g n  i n v e s t o r s ,  s i n c e  d o m e s t i c  i n v e s t o r s  w e r e  a l r e a d y  s u b j e c t  t o  t h e  t a x .  E n d  f o o t n o t e  1 . ]   Other types of capital controls more specifically target the 
composition of capital inflows in an attempt to direct them toward longer-term 
investments. For example, Indonesia will require investors to hold their short-term 
central bank bills for at least six months starting in May. Similarly, Brazil has imposed a 
tax on the short-term external borrowing of banks and firms to lengthen the maturity 
profile of these liabilities. South Korea and Taiwan have set quantitative limits on banks’ 
exposure to foreign exchange derivatives in the forward market, in part seeking to 
reduce the short-term external debt that banks would use to hedge these derivatives.
Some of the capital controls recently implemented likely will be more successful in 
achieving their objectives than others. Past studies do not find significant effects of 
capital controls on the aggregate volume of inflows or on exchange rates beyond the 
short run. 2  [ F o o t n o t e  2 .  F o r  a  s u r v e y  o n  t h e  e f f e c t i v e n e s s  o f  c a p i t a l  c o n t r o l s  p r i o r  t o  2 0 0 9 ,  s e e  J o h n a t h a n  O s t r y ,  A t i s h  R .

power of controls over time. However, it should also be recognized that gauging the

effect  of  controls  on  inflows  is  difficult,  particularly   as  controls  are  more  likely  to  be  
imposed  when  capital  flows  are  stronger.    There  is  greater  evidence  that  capital  controls  
alter  the  composition   of  inflows.   Studies  find  that  controls  implemented   by  Chile  and  
Colombia   during  the  1990s  were  successful   in  tilting  the  composition  of  inflows  toward  
investments   with   longer  maturities.3   Systematic   empirical  studies  on  capital  controls  
implemented   since  2009  have  not  yet  been  conducted,   and  it  is  too  early  to  judge  the  
effectiveness   of  the  recent  measures.   
Until  recently,  the  weight  of  opinion  in  the  international   official  community   was  against  
the  use  of  capital  controls,  arguing  that  the  longer‐term  costs  of  the  distortions   they  
create  excee d  any  short‐term   benefits  they  might  offer  in  stabilizing   domestic  financial  
conditions.    However,  the  academic   and  policy  literature  has  recently  become  more  open  
to  capital  controls,  partly  reflecting   a  reassessment  of  the  extent  to  which  sudden  surges  
in  inflows  can  complicate   macroeconomic   management   and  create  financial  risks.   Recent  
publications   by  the  Intern ational  Monetary   Fund  (IMF),  for  example,   support  the  use  of  
controls  under  certain  circumstances.    These  include  cases  in  which  the  currency  is  not  
undervalued,  the  level  of  reserves  is  already  more  than  adequate,   and  the  economy   is  in  
danger  of  overheating   despite  significant   macroeconomic   policy  steps.4   However,  the  
IMF  work  does  not  encourage   the  indiscriminate   use  of  controls,  particularly   given  the  
difficulty  in  determining   if  these  conditions   are  satisfied.    
All  told,  capital  controls  may  well  be  an  appropriate  part  of  a  toolkit  to  address  the  policy  
challenges   currently   facing  some  EMEs.   But  at  the  same  time,  the  longer‐term  benefits  of  
free  capital  markets  as  well  as  the  costs  of  capital  controls—for   example,   distortions   of  
market  signals  and  incentives   for  evasion—should   not  be  forgotten.    In  particular,   capital  
controls  should  not  be  viewed  as  substitutes   for  needed  policy  adjustments.    Some  EMEs  
need  greater  exchange  rate  flexibility   to  address  the  challenges   posed  by  capital  inflows  
on  a  longer‐term  basis.   Other  EMEs  could  address  the  problems   of  overheating   and  
currency  appreciation   by  changing   the  mix  of  policy  toward  fiscal  tightening   before  
turning  to  capital  controls.

to be much affected by the earthquake in Japan.     
In flation  in Mexico fell to 3½ percent in the  first quarter, 1 percentage point  
below our previous forecast, owing to appreciation of the peso as well a s to increases in  
supply for some  food products.  For the  remainder of the forecast period, we project  
Mexican inflation to come in  just under the upper  bound of the Bank of Mexico’s   
2 to 4 percent target range.   Price pressures appear to have increased  significantly  in 
Brazil, with headline inflation rising to a near double- digit annual pace in the first 
quarter.  While food price inflation has eased, core inflation has continued to rise in 
recent months, and house  prices  have risen  in major cities.  In response, the central bank 
raised its policy  rate by  an additional 50 basis points in March, and the  government  
doubled a tax on consumer loans in early  April.  Brazilian authorities continue to be  
concerned about capital inflows, prompting them to introduce a 6 percent tax on new ly  
issued external  bonds and loans with maturity of less than two years.

Financial Developments 
Market sentiment over the intermeeting period was buffeted by a number of 
unfolding global risks.  Around the time of the March FOMC meeting, global bond yields 
and equity markets fell sharply in response to the Japanese earthquake and continuing 
political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa regi on.  Markets subsequently 
recovered somewhat, but incoming economic data were weaker than investors had 
expected, on balance, and they appeared to pull back from risk-taking again in mid-April 
amid heightened attention to peripheral Eur ope and the U.S. fiscal outlook.  On net over 
the period, yields on most nominal Treasury securities inched up, broad stock price 
indexes posted small gains, and risk spr eads on corporate bonds narrowed a bit.  
Although concerns about the eff ects of the continuing rise in  commodity prices garnered 
significant market attention, near-term TIPS-based inflat ion compensation rose only 
slightly on net; longer-term inflation comp ensation, however, increased more notably.  
The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by derivatives pr ices ended the period 
little changed, while measures of uncertainty around the path edged higher.  Short-term 
funding rates, including the eff ective federal funds rate, shif ted down several basis points 
in early April following a change in the FDIC ’s deposit insurance assessment system.   
The broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar declined 
about 1½ percent as several fo reign central banks tightened  monetary policy and as 
foreign economic data continued to improve re lative to those for th e United States.  The 
dollar appreciated against the Japanese yen fo llowing official interventions to weaken the 
yen in the aftermath of the Tohoku earthquake.   
Borrowing conditions for businesses a nd households eased further over the 
period.  Borrowing by nonfinancial  corporations remained robus t in the first quarter of 
2011, and indicators of business credit quality continued to recover.  Commercial 
mortgage markets showed additional signs of  stabilization.  Consumer credit markets 
improved further, although home  prices saw additional declin es and residential mortgage 
lending remained tight. 
Overall bank credit was roughly unchanged in  March, as declines in real estate 
and consumer loans offset further increases in commercial and indus trial (C&I) loans and 
securities holdings.  The April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending

Practices (SLOOS) indicated that  banks’ lending standards con tinued to ease in the first 
quarter for C&I and consumer loans, while demand for bank loans other than residential 
mortgages generally increased.  The expansion of  M2 slowed slightly in the first quarter, 
compared with the second half of 2010.  A robust increase in li quid deposits outweighed 
a further sharp contraction in  small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds. 
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Over the intermeeting period, money market  futures rates were little changed on 
net, and Treasury note yields edged up, amid not able swings in risk sentiment in response 
to global events.1  The March FOMC statement prom pted a modest rise in nominal 
yields, as market participants perceived a somewhat more optimistic tone in the 
Committee’s economic outlook and heightened concerns about inflation risks.  The 
content of the March FOMC minutes was largel y in line with expectations and prompted 
little price action; however, market participan ts noted the range of viewpoints within the 
Committee about the prospects for the policy ou tlook.  Market particip ants appeared to 
read the incoming economic data as somewhat weaker than expected, on balance, and 
potentially suggestive of slower economi c growth in the near term.     
On net, both the mean and modal paths of the expected federal funds rate over the 
next two years were little changed over the intermeeting perio d.  Futures quotes, 
combined with the staff’s usual assumption about term premiums, indicate that market  
participants expect the federal funds rate to fi rst rise above the current  target range in the 
first quarter of 2012 and to reach about 1.4 percent by the second quarter of 2013, similar 
to indications at the time of the March FOMC meeting.  The modal policy path derived from quotes on interest rate cap s still rises above the current target range in late 2012.  
Comments by Federal Reserve officials during the intermeeting period highlighted 
divergent views on the possible course of future monetary policy tightening, contributing 
to somewhat higher market-based measures of policy uncertainty 12 months ahead. 
Results from the Open Market Desk’s latest survey of primary dealers also 
suggested little change since March in the an ticipated path of policy.  Average forecasts 
for the federal funds rate through the end of 2012 stayed essentially the same as in the 
previous survey, although the distribution of d ealers’ forecasts for the timing of the first 
policy-rate increase shifted marginally toward  earlier tightening, with  the first half of 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 12 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 3 basis points.

2012 seen as the most likely time for lifto ff.  Respondents did not anticipate major 
changes to the language of the statement at the upcoming FOMC meeting, and they 
unanimously expected the Federal Reserve’s current Treasury purchase program to end in 
June with a total program size of $600 billion.2  Dealers forecast near-term core PCE 
inflation to edge modestly higher, while forecasts for longer-term CPI inflation, and the 
reported uncertainty about those forecasts, we re little changed.  They downgraded their 
forecasts for GDP growth in 2011 to an average of 3.0 percent from 3.5 percent but 
maintained their forecasts for 2012 and 2013. 
In response to questions about the seque nce in which they expected various 
measures for the removal of policy accommodati on to occur, dealers indicated that they  
anticipated a sequence involving the removal of the “extended  period” language first, 
followed by the use of short-term reserve drai ning tools, followed by an increase in the 
interest rate paid on reserve balances, follo wed by asset sales.  This sequence was the 
same as that reported in the survey conducte d in January 2010, the last time dealers were 
specifically asked about this issue.  Howeve r, dealers suggested that sales of Treasury 
securities, agency debt, and agency mortga ge-backed securities (MBS) were likely to 
take place much sooner after liftoff than they had expected in January 2010.  In addition, 
dealers now expect that, prior to an incr ease in policy rates or asset sales, the 
reinvestment of principal payments on Federal Reserve securities holdings will end, a 
possibility that was not incl uded in the prior survey.  
Yields on 2- to 10-year nominal Treasury securities increased 3 to 9 basis points, 
on balance, over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting in part some reversal of the 
safe-haven flows witnessed in mid-March.  Market-based measures of near-term  
uncertainty about long-term Treasury yields decl ined a bit, on net.  Late in the period, 
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) revised its outlook for the long-term credit rating of the United 
States from stable to negative.  Although the announcement, which also reaffirmed the 
United States’ AAA rating, led investors to focus on risks related to fiscal imbalances and 
current budgetary challenges in  the United States, market  participants reportedly 
perceived little new information in the announcement itself, and, after some initial volatility, the net effect on Treas ury yields appeared modest.  Indicative quotes suggested 
that spreads on credit default swaps (CDS) on U.S. Treasury securities increased a few

basis points following the announcement but remained well below their levels of 2008 
and early 2009. 
TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next five years rose early in the 
period, in part because of the ongoing rise
 in commodity prices, but it fell sharply 
following the release of lower-than-expected core March CPI figures in mid-April and 
ended the period only slightly higher on net.   Forward inflation compensation 5 to 10 
years ahead rose 16 basis points,  putting it close to the upper end of its historical range, 
with staff models suggesting th at the rise was driven prim arily by changes in liquidity 
and inflation-risk premiums rather than by increases in expected inflation.  Inflation 
compensation measured from inflation swap s shifted up 15 to 20 ba sis points across the 
term structure.  Short-term inflation exp ectations from the Michigan survey were 
unchanged in March after jumping notably in February; however, the survey’s measures 
of long-term inflation expectations fell, reversing the increas e registered in the previous 
month.   
ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad stock price indexes rose about 1 percent, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, despite losses triggered by tensions associated with global events around the time  
of the March FOMC meeting and a noticeable drop following S&P’s revision to the long-
term rating outlook of the United States.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index 
spiked briefly in mid-March but posted a moderate net drop, closing the intermeeting 
period at the low end of recent ranges.  The staff’s estimate of the spread between the 
expected real equity return for S&P 500 fi rms and the real 10-year Treasury yield—a 
rough gauge of the equity risk premium— was little changed, on net, over the period, 
remaining elevated by historical standards.  
Based on first-quarter earnings reports  from about 100 firms in the S&P 500 
index and private-sector analysts’ forecasts for firms that have yet to report, we estimate 
that operating earnings per share of firms in the index rose at a quarterly rate of about 
3 percent relative to the fourth quarter.  Over the four weeks ending in mid-April, 
analysts’ forecasts of year-a head earnings for S&P 500 firms were revised upward, owing 
mostly to revisions from the energy sector. 
Earnings reports for banks generally met or exceeded analysts’ expectations.  
Profits rose slightly in the first quarter at most of the largest and regional banks, again in

large part because of lower loan-loss provisions, while net interest income fell on a 
quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year basis at most of the largest banks. The results of the 
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) were generally in line with market 
expectations. On average, stock prices and CDS spreads for large banks were little 
changed around the time of the CCAR’s release and subsequent announcements by 
several banks of plans for dividend increases or share repurchases. Over the period as a 
whole, large-bank stock prices fell about 3 percent, while CDS spreads edged lower.
Yields on corporate bonds were generally little changed, on net, over the 
intermeeting period; as a result, spreads of BBB-rated and speculative-grade corporate- 
bonds narrowed slightly. The average bid price in the secondary market for syndicated 
leveraged loans moved up further.
Hedge funds reportedly saw inflows during the first quarter, with the bulk of these 
flows directed toward funds with mandates that involve comparatively liquid assets. 
However, the appetite for leverage on the part of the hedge fund industry reportedly 
remained muted. Hedge funds posted modest returns over the intermeeting period; 
incoming information suggests that, although several large funds reported modest losses 
in March as a result of developments in Japan, those losses were not widespread, and 
there were no reports of significant deleveraging. Mutual funds also attracted robust 
inflows, on average, in March and early April, with the bulk of the net inflows going to 
taxable bond funds and flows into bank loan funds continuing apace. Equity funds had 
small net inflows, but tax-exempt bond funds continued to experience moderate net 
redemptions.
Rates in short-term funding markets shifted lower in the days immediately 
following the FDIC’s April 1  implementation of a change in its deposit insurance 
assessment system. (See the box "Effects of the FDIC’s New Deposit Insurance 
Assessment System on Short-Term Market Interest Rates.") The move to lower levels of 
the effective federal funds and general collateral repo rates pushed other short-term 
money market yields lower, including yields on Treasury bills, commercial paper, and 
Eurodollar deposits. Although these rates saw some volatility in early April, they were 
generally down a few basis points over the intermeeting period. The change reportedly 
had few immediate adverse effects on the operations of money market mutual funds or 
securities lenders. Haircuts in the repo market exhibited mixed changes across collateral 
types over the period. Spreads on both 30-day A2/P2-rated nonfinancial commercial

Effects  of  the  FDIC’s  New   Deposit  Insurance   Assessment  
System  on  Short‐Term   Market  Interest  Rates    
On  April  1,  2011,  the  Federal   Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  (FDIC)  implemented   
changes  to  its  deposit  insurance   assessment  system  that  broadened   the  
definition   of  the  assessment  base  and  altered  assessment  rates,  especially   for  
large  banks.   The  new  assessment  system  has  resulted  in  downward   pressure  on  
overnight  federal  funds  and  repo  rates,  evidently   as  banks’  demand  for  short‐
term  funding  declined  in  light  of  the  higher   all‐in  costs  of  borrowing   in  these   
markets.   The  lower  levels   of  these  rates,  in  turn,  have  led  to  a  softening   in  other  
short‐term   interest   rates,  such  as  rates  on  Treasury  bills,  Eurodollar   deposits,   and  
commercial   paper,  as  investors,   particularly   money  market   mutual  funds,  have  
reportedly   reallocated   their  investments   across  alternative   short‐term   
investments.   
Under  the  FDIC’s  new  system,  insurance   premiums   are  assessed   based  on  an  
insured  depository   institution’s   total  assets  less  tangible  capital—essentially   all  
liabilities—rather   than  domestic   deposits.1   In  addition,  the  FDIC  implemented   a  
new  assessment  rate  schedule.   The  new  schedule  continues   to  assign  higher  
assessment  rates  to  banks  that  pose  greater  risks  to  the  insurance  system.   The  
changes  in  the  assessment  system  are  intended   to  be  revenue‐neutral  in  the  
aggregate.    While  individual   bank’s   actual  assessment  rates  will  not  be  known  
until  the  second  quarter  Call  Reports  become  available  in  August,  market  
participants   have  suggested   that  the  assessment  rates  for  some  of  the  largest  
banks  could  range  from  9  to  20  basis  points.  
Under  the  new  assessment   system,  federal  funds  purchased   and  funds  borrowed   
in  repo  markets  are,  for  the  first  time,  included  in  the  FDIC’s  assessment  base,  
raising  banks’  short‐term  marginal   funding  costs  for  these  instruments,  all  else  
being  equal.   As  a  result,  in  the  federal  funds  market,  the  costs  associated   with  
the  arbitrage  in  which  banks  borrow  at  the  federal  funds  rate  and  hold   the  
proceeds  as  balances  in  their  reserve  accounts   to  earn  the  interest  rate  paid  on  
excess  reserves  (the  IOER  rate)  have  risen.   In  response,  the  average  federal  
funds  rate  has  declined  and  the  gap  between  the  federal  funds  rate  and  the  IOER  
rate  has  widened.   As  shown  in  the  table  below,  the  federal  funds  rate  declined

from  an  average  level   of  14  basis  points  in  March   to  an  average  level  of  10  basis  
points  in  the  first  week  after  the  new  assessment  system  was  implemented,   
about  in  line  with   market  expectations.    Judging  from  futures  market  quotes,  
federal   funds  are  expected   to  trade  close  to  10  basis  points  for  some  time.   The  
volume  of  trades  in  the  brokered   federal   funds  market  decreased   from  an  
average  level   in  March   of  about  $50  billion  to  an  average  level   of  $45  billion  in  the  
first  week  after  implementation.2    
Repo  rates  for  Treasury   and  agency  collateral   have  also  softened—Treasury   
general   collateral   (GC)  repo  traded  at  5  basis  points,  on  average,  in  the  first  week  
after  the  new  assessment  system  was  implemented   compared   with  13  basis   
points  in  March.    The  initial  effect  on  the  overnight  Treasury  GC  repo  rate  was  
much  greater  than  anticipated.    Indeed,  in  the  first  few  days  after  
implementation,   Treasury  GC  repo  traded   near  zero  basis   points.    Market  
contacts  generally   attributed   this  initial   decline  to  some  banks’  withdrawal   of  
collateral   from  the  market  in  an  effort  to  pare  the  size  of  their  balance  sheets,  as  
well  as  to  a  host  of  other  temporary  factors.3   Over  the  subsequent  few  days,  
however,  the  Treasury  GC  repo  rate  moved  up  to  an  average  of  7  basis  points.     
Lower  Treasury  GC  repo  rates  have  reportedly  raised  money  market  investors’  
demand   for  other  high‐quality,  short‐term  assets,  such  as  Treasury  bills,  
Eurodollar  deposits,  and  commercial  paper,  putting  downward  pressure  on  the  
yields  of  these  assets.4   In  particular,   in  the  week  after  the  new  assessment  
system  was  implemented,  the  rates  on  four‐week  Treasury  bills,  overnight   
Eurodollar  deposits,  and  overnight  AA‐rated  nonfinancial   commercial  paper  each  
moved  down  about  4  basis  points  relative  to  their  average  levels  in  March.  
More  recently,  short‐term  market  interest  rates  associated   with  federal  funds,  GC  
repo,  and  other  money  market  instruments   have  generally  remained   near  the  
levels  seen  in  the  first  week  of  April,  although  the  occurrence  of  several  tax‐
related   heavy  payment  days  since  then  have  complicated   our  ability  to  isolate  the  
ongoing  effects  of  the  new  FDIC  assessment  system  on  interest  rates.    
2 The Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports that in the 
market for federal funds, trading activity and rates bid by domestic banks have decreased, 
while trading activity of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks has declined only a bit. 
3 The effects in the repo market may initially have been amplified by constraints on the 
availability of collateral in the market reflecting quarter end and Japanese fiscal year end 
effects. In addition, the ongoing decline in Treasury collateral stemming from the Federal 
Reserve’s large scale asset purchases and the decline in the Treasury’s Supplementary 
Financing Account balance may have exacerbated the collateral shortage. The shortage of 
collateral in the few days after the implementation of the new FDIC assessment may have also 
caused increased specialness of individual securities issues; the amount of securities borrowed 
in the Federal Reserve’s overnight securities lending operations moved up relative to the 
average amount of securities borrowed through the facility in March. 
4 From March 29 to April 4, 2011, money market mutual funds reported declines in total 
assets in funds that hold primarily short term Treasury assets and engage in repo, while assets 
in prime funds increased. This reallocation of assets is consistent with the significant decline in 
repo rates and consequent decline in short term Treasury yields over this period.

slightly, on net, while spreads between term Libor and OIS ra tes were little changed.   
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Overall, net debt financing by nonfinanci al corporations remained robust in 
March, capping off a solid first quarter.  Net issuance of both investment- and 
speculative-grade bonds by nonfinancial corpor ations remained strong, and outstanding 
amounts of C&I loans and nonfinan cial commercial paper incr eased notably.  Consistent 
with the growth in C&I loans, the SLOOS condu cted in April indicated that, over the past 
three months, banks’ lending standards and terms had eased while demand for C&I loans 
from large and middle-market firms had im proved (see SLOOS appendix). Increases in 
loan demand from smaller firms were reportedly less widespread than for larger firms.   
Gross issuance of syndicated leveraged lo ans continued to climb in the first 
quarter.  Most of this issuance again consis ted of opportunistic refinancing activity amid 
attractive financing conditions, supported by strong demand for leveraged loans from  
institutional investors, partic ularly those asset managers catering to retail investors 
seeking floating-rate exposures.  The vigor ous increase in issuance occurred despite the 
postponement of some refinancing deals in  mid-March, when investors pushed back 
against pressures on pricing a nd terms that had been eviden t during the first two months 
of the year.  
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinanci al firms, including both primary and 
secondary offerings, was quite strong in March, ev en relative to pre-crisis levels.  In the 
fourth quarter, share repurchases and cas h-financed mergers continued to rebound, 
implying strongly negative net equity issuan ce.  Heavy volumes of announcements of 
mergers and new share repurchase programs in  the first quarter suggest that equity 
retirements will continue apace.  
Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued to improve.  
Through the first quarter, the pace at wh ich Moody’s Investors Service upgraded 
nonfinancial corporate bonds exceeded the pace of downgrades, and the six-month 
trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial firm s remained close to zero.  The expected 
year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial  firms from Moody’s KMV, although still 
somewhat elevated, moved a bit lower in Marc h and April.  Moreover, a considerable net 
fraction of respondents to a special question in  the SLOOS indicated that overall credit

quality improved among large and middle-market  firms that inquired about or applied for 
credit in the first quarter.  Such improvement s in the credit quality of smaller firms were 
reportedly less widespread. 
Commercial mortgage markets showed some  signs of continued stabilization 
despite an ongoing contraction in mortgage de bt.  Property sales increased but remained 
tepid, and prices, though still at depressed le vels, increased a bit further.  Delinquency 
rates for commercial real estate (CRE) loans a ppear to have leveled off in recent months, 
perhaps signaling a possible turn in the performance of th ese loans, although delinquency 
rates remained elevated relative to their hi storical averages.  The April SLOOS found that 
standards on CRE loans were little changed, on net, last quarter, but that demand for such 
loans increased, particularly at  larger banks, probably reflecting financing for buyers of 
distressed properties and some increase in construction in the multifamily sector.  
However, there remains little demand for new construction loans in other sectors.  
Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed secu rities picked up in the first quarter, 
reaching a volume that was close to total issuance in 2010.   
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Mortgage interest rates and yields on current-coupon agency MBS both rose 
modestly during the intermeeting period, a nd their spreads to longer-term Treasury 
securities narrowed slightly.  Mortgage refinancing activity re mained near its lowest level 
in more than two years, suggesting that ma ny homeowners were unable to refinance their 
mortgages despite mortgage rates that are st ill favorable by historical standards.  The 
Treasury Department announced on March 21 th at it would begin to sell its $142 billion 
agency MBS portfolio at a pace of about $10 billion per month; yields on Treasury 
securities and agency MBS both edged hi gher immediately following the announcement, 
but there appears to have been little lasting effect on MBS spreads.  In addition, Maiden Lane II LLC began competitive sales of its non-agency residential MBS holdings; in the 
wake of the success of its in itial auctions, the prices of  non-agency residential MBS 
securities more broadly were  reportedly little changed, but  some market participants 
noted that investor interest in this market has increase d.  (See the box “Balance Sheet

Balance  Sheet  Developments   over  the  Intermeeting  Period  
Total  assets  of  the  Federal   Reserve  increased   $92  billion  over  the  intermeeting   period  to  
reach  a  level   of  about  $2.7  trillion  (refer   to  table  on  the  next  page).   Nearly  all  of  this  
change  was  due  to  the  Federal   Reserve’s  ongoing  asset   purchase  program,  which  
boosted  outright  securities   holdings  $91  billion.  
The  Open   Market  Desk  at  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  New   York   (FRBNY)  conducted   
23  permanent  operations   to  purchase  longer‐term  Treasury  securities   since  the  March  
meeting.    These  operations,   which  covered  a  range  of  maturities   for  nominal  securities   as  
well  as  2  operations   in  TIPS,  totaled  $129  billion.1   To  provide  flexibility   in  conducting   the  
asset  purchase  program,  the  Desk  temporarily  relaxed   its  per‐issue  limit  on  System  Open  
Market  Account  (SOMA)  holdings  of  individual   Treasury   issues  late  last  year.   SOMA  
holdings  of  49  individual   issues  now  exceed  35  percent  of  the  total  outstanding   for  each  
issue,  and  SOMA  holdings  of  11  issues  exceed  50  percent  of  the  total  outstanding   for  each  
issue;  the  latter  are  all  high‐coupon  30‐year  bonds  with   remaining   maturities   between   
4  and  10  years.  
In  other  asset  categories,   loans  outstanding   under  the  Term  Asset‐Backed  Securities   Loan   
Facility  (TALF)  fell  about  $2  billion  over  the  intermeeting   period,  reflecting   additional   
prepayments   of  TALF  loans.   The  FRBNY  began  selling  securities   in  the  Maiden  Lane  II  
portfolio  through  a  competitive  auction  process;  to  date,  a  total  of  $2.5  billion   in  face  
amount  of  these  securities   has  been  sold.   These  transactions   will  reduce  the  loan  from  
the  FRBNY  to  Maiden  Lane  II  on  monthly  loan  paydown  dates.   Overall,  the  net  portfolio  
holdings  of  Maiden   Lane   LLC,  Maiden  Lane   II  LLC,  and  Maiden  Lane   III  LLC  were  little  
changed.   The  Federal  Reserve’s  participation   in  the  G‐7  foreign  exchange   intervention  
resulted  in  a  modest  decrease  in  foreign  currency–denominated   assets  (not  shown).2   
Finally,  foreign  central  bank  liquidity  swaps  remained   at  zero.  
On  the  liability  side  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s  balance  sheet,  Federal  Reserve  notes  in  
circulation   increased   $9  billion  over   the  period.    The  Treasury’s  General  Account,   which  is  
volatile  from  month   to  month,   rose  $65  billion   on  net.   The  Treasury’s  Supplementary   
Financing   Account  fell  $45  billion  to  about   $5  billion;  it  will  remain  at  this  $5  billion   level  
until  the  debt  ceiling  is  raised.   Term   deposits  increased   to  $5  billion   as  another  small‐
value  Term  Deposit  Facility  offering  settled  on  April  7;  it  will  mature  on  May  5.   Reflecting   
these  factors  and  the  effects  of  the  asset  purchase  program,  reserve  balances  of  
depository   institutions   rose  $91  billion  over  the  period;  foreign  depository  institutions   
accounted   for  the  bulk  of  the  increase  in  these  balances.    
1 These operations include purchases conducted between March 14 and April 19, 2011. During this 
period, $123 billion in Treasury securities purchases settled on the balance sheet and agency debt and 
MBS holdings declined $31 billion.

index from CoreLogic, house prices tumble d at an annual rate of 16½ percent in 
February, the ninth consecutive monthly dec line.  The sustained downtrend in house 
prices and still-tight lendi ng conditions continued to depr ess demand for housing.  Rates 
of serious delinquency—defined as the percen tage of mortgage loans that are 90 days 
past due or in foreclosure—for subprime and prime mortgages were little changed at 
elevated levels.  However, the rate of new delinquencies on prime mortgages declined 
further.   
Conditions in consumer credit markets continued their gradual improvement.  
Growth of consumer credit picked u
p in February because of another solid gain in 
nonrevolving credit.  Revolving cr edit, in contrast, contracted further, albeit at a slower 
rate.  Delinquency and charge-off rates for cr edit card debt have moved down in recent 
months toward their pre-crisis levels.  The number of credit card offers mailed to households ticked up slightly in February, re turning to levels seen  in October 2008.  The 
April SLOOS showed that several large ba nks eased lending policies on credit card and 
auto loans, and the net fracti on of banks that reported havi ng become more willing to 
make consumer installment loans registered its strongest reading sin ce the first half of 
1994.  In addition, demand for auto loans reportedly strengthened last quarter, whereas demand was little changed for credit card a nd other consumer loans.  Issuance of 
consumer ABS remained steady in the first th ree months of 2011, a nd investor appetite 
for securitizations collat eralized by relatively riskier loan s, such as sub-prime auto loans 
and private student loans,  continued to increase. 
FOREIGN  DEVELOPMENTS  
Foreign equity prices and sovereign bond yields fell sharply following the 
Japanese earthquake on March 11, but by the en d of March they had generally recovered 
in markets outside of Japan as concerns a bout the extent of the resulting disruption 
diminished.  On net, most foreign yields and equity prices have increased since the 
March 15 FOMC meeting, although they have  changed little, on balance, since the 
March 8 data reported in the Tealbook for that  meeting.  Japanese equity prices remain 
about 10 percent below their pre-earthquake le vel, as concerns over the economic outlook 
persist.  
The broad nominal index of the U.S. dolla r declined about 1½ percent over the

earthquake, as reduced risk a ppetite led to an unwinding of  carry trades.  In addition, 
investors bid up the yen in anticipation of large earthquake-related  repatriation flows, 
similar to those following the 1995 earthquake in Kobe.  In response, the G-7 conducted 
its first coordinated intervention since Se ptember 2000.  The yen depreciated sharply 
immediately following the intervention announcem ent and continued to depreciate into 
early April.   
To reassure financial markets, the Ba nk of Japan injected record amounts of 
liquid
ity immediately after th e earthquake and expanded its asset purchase program.  In 
contrast, as expected, the European Central Bank (ECB) increased its main policy rate 
25 basis points to 1¼ percent on April 7, and mark ets are pricing in further rate increases 
by the ECB by the end of the year.  The Bank of England and the Bank of Canada left 
policy rates unchanged, but expectations for the pa th of short-term interest rates in both 
countries continue to indicate one or two policy rate hikes later this year.  Near-term  
inflation compensation measured from indexe d debt moved up in the euro area and the 
United Kingdom over the intermeeting period, like ly reflecting in part the recent rise in 
energy prices; long-term inflation co mpensation moved up more modestly. 
In early April, the Portuguese government requested financial support from the 
European Union and the International Monetary Fund, but markets remain concerned over the capacity of the Portuguese government to reach agreement on an appropriate fiscal consolidation program.  Later in th e period, yields on Greek and other peripheral 
sovereign debt jumped following statements by German officials that highlighted an 
ongoing debate about the advisab ility of restructuring Greek sovereign debt.  Over the 
intermeeting period as a whole, spreads of Greek sovereign debt relative to German 
bunds rose nearly 200 basis points, and Portugue se spreads increased 150 basis points.  In 
contrast, Spanish, Italian, and Irish spreads were little changed.  In addition, Libor–OIS 
spreads, along with indicators of dollar f unding pressure in Europe, moved down, on net, 
indicating that funding conditions for core European banks continue to improve.   
Monetary authorities in China increase d banks’ lending and deposit rates 25 basis 
points, the fourth increase si nce October, and continued to tighten reserve requirements.  
In addition, monetary policy in a number of other emerging market economies— including Chile, India, Singapore, and Taiw an—was tightened over the period.  Equity 
and bond flows into emerging market economies turned positive in early April following 
outflows earlier in the year.  The dollar depr eciated against almost all emerging market

market monetary authorities.  
Foreign official investors ma de sizable purchases of U.S. Trea sury securities in 
February, in part reflecting investments of proceeds from foreign exchange intervention.  
Partial and confidential data on custody acc ounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York show continued solid acquisitions of  Treasury securities through mid-April.  
Foreign official investors con tinued to make moderate purchases of agency securities 
through March, while foreign private investor s sold agency bonds in both January and 
February. 
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
During the intermeeting period, the Treasur y auctioned $165 b illion of nominal 
coupon securities across the maturity spectrum  and $11 billion of TIPS.  Issuance sizes of 
nominal securities were uncha nged, and the auctions were ge nerally well received, with 
bid-to-cover ratios close to re cent averages.  Announced issuance sizes for 5- and 10-year 
TIPS were somewhat larger than those in the past.  The reopening of the 10-year TIPS 
was very well received, with a higher-than-av erage bid-to-cover ratio and better-than-
expected pricing, likely refl ecting strong investor demand fo r protection against inflation 
amid rising commodity prices. 
U.S. fiscal issues garnered market a ttention as the Congress grappled with 
passage of the 2011 budget, debated an increase in the statutory debt limit, and outlined 
proposals for longer-term fiscal consolidati on.  On April 4, Treasury Secretary Geithner 
wrote to the Congress to provi de an update on the Treasury’ s projections regarding when 
the statutory debt limit would be reached and to make the case for a timely increase.  The 
Treasury projected that the st atutory debt limit of $14.29 tr illion would be reached no 
later than May 16, after which extraordinar y measures—including the disinvestment of 
two government retirement funds and the Ex change Stabilization Fund—would need to 
be taken to temporarily finance the governme nt if the debt ceiling was not raised.  The 
extra leeway for the United States to borrow within the limit provided by these measures 
is projected to be exhausted around July 8.3  Yields on Treasury bills maturing after  
July 8 do not currently suggest widespread market concerns about the debt ceiling. 
3 The Treasury’s projection is consistent with the current staff projection. The box “Debt Subject 
to Limit” in the January 2011 Tealbook, Book A, outlined a variety of extraordinary measures used by the

Conditions in the municipal bond market remained somewhat strained.  Yields on 
long-term general-obligation bonds rose moderately.  The ratios of  the yields on these 
bonds to those on comparable-maturity Treas ury securities and AAA-rated corporate 
bonds—gauges of relative risks in the muni cipal bond market—changed little, on net, and 
remained high by historical standards.  Th e spreads of CDS on the broad municipal 
market (as measured by the MCDX index) and state-specific CDS spreads for California 
and Illinois were also little changed at relatively high le vels.  Issuance of long-term  
municipal bonds continued to be weak in Ma rch, in part because issuance was unusually 
heavy in the fourth quarter of 2010 ahead of  the expiration of the Build America Bond 
program, but the weakness likely also reflect ed weak investor demand.  The pace of 
issuance of short-term municipa l securities was slow in March, consistent with seasonal 
patterns.     
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND  MONEY  
Bank credit was about unchanged in Marc h after having declined at an average 
annual rate of 3 percent over the first two months of the year.  Core loans on banks’ 
books fell at a 4½ percent rate for the month, a somewhat slower pace of decline than 
earlier in the year.  Commer cial and industrial loans, which have grown moderately, on 
average, since last fall, expanded briskl y in March, though the recent increases have  
occurred mainly at large domestic banks and the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign 
banks.  By contrast, commercial real estate loans continued to contract at roughly the 
same rate as in recent quarters.  Closed-e nd residential real estate loans held on banks’ 
books, after increasing over th e second half of 2010, shrank during the first quarter.  
Though much of the decline can be attributed to  substantial sales of loans to the GSEs by 
a few large banks, the decreases are also c onsistent with the w eakening in demand for 
these loans reported in the SLOOS.  Home e quity loans also contracted further.  
Consumer loans declined modestly in March, as the pace of contrac tion in credit card 
loans slowed and other consumer loans, whic h continued to be damp ed by policy changes 
affecting refund anticipation and student loans, remained flat.  Banks’ securities holdings 
increased moderately in March, reflecting pu rchases of Treasury and agency securities, 
particularly by one large bank.

the Treasury has not exhausted the funds accessible thr ough these measures, it has av ailable to it a one-time

Disability Fund, to avoid breaching the ceiling on this date.

M2 expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in March and at a 4½ percent pace 
over the first quarter of 2011, a slightly slower rate of increase than that observed over 
the second half of last year.  Liquid deposits rose moderately in Ma rch, likely boosted in 
part by a shift from lower-yielding M2 co mponents.  Small time deposits and retail 
money market mutual funds contracted further last month and stand at levels not seen since 2005, as yields on these assets remain ed extremely low.  Currency advanced 
significantly in March, supporte d mostly by robust demand for bank notes from abroad.

Appendix 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
The April 2011 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey  on Bank Lending Practices 
indicated that, on net, bank lending standards and terms generally had eased somewhat further 
during the first quarter of this year, and th at the demand for bank loans from businesses and 
households increased slightly on balance.1  Banks continued to loosen standards and terms for 
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and consumer  loans, and standards were little changed for 
loans secured by real estate.2  Demand for C&I loans and for commercial mortgages increased, 
while that for residential mort gages continued to decrease.   
The majority  of respondents that had eased  standards and terms on C&I loans cited 
increased competition from other banks and nonbank lenders as the most important reason for the 
easing.  Only  a few pointed to an increased tolera nce for risk, consistent with the small number 
that reported having reduced premiums  on riskie r loans.  Banks that had eased standards and 
terms also pointed to a more favorable or l ess uncertain economic outlook, although the fraction 
that did so in  this survey was smaller than in the previous one.  Of the handful of banks that 
reported having tightened terms, all cited a redu ced tolerance for risk as a factor driving the 
tightening in terms, and most also pointed to  a less favorable or more uncertain economic  
outlook, decreased liquidity in the secondary market for C&I loans, and increased concerns about 
recent legislative changes, supervisory ac tions, or changes in accounting standards. 
Regarding changes in standards and terms on loans to households, several large banks 
eased lending policies on credit card and auto loans, and the net fraction of banks that reported 
having become more willing to make consumer in stallment loans rose to its highest level since 
the first half of 1994.3  Moderate net fractions of banks reported a net easing of the spreads of 
auto loan rates over their own cost of funds, a nd roughly similar fractions of large banks also 
eased several other terms on such loans.  
1 The April 2011 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses 
and households over the past three m onths.  The survey also included sets  of special questions on changes 
in the overall credit quality of potential business borr owers and on changes in applications for new or 
increased credit card lines and in the quality of app licants.  This appendix is based on responses from 
55 domestic banks and 22 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Resp ondent banks received the 
survey on or after March 29, 2011, and responses were due by April 12, 2011. 
2 For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction 
of banks that reported having tightened standards minus the fraction of banks that reported having eased 
standards.  For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fraction of banks that reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand. 
3 Large banks are defined as banks with assets greater than or equal to $20 billion as of December 
31, 2010, and other banks as those with assets of less than $20 billion.

 Responses to the questions on loan demand were mixed.  Demand for C&I loans from  
large and middle-market firms reportedly increased over the past three months.4  Moreover, in 
response to a special question, a considerable net fraction of banks indicated that the overall 
credit quality  of large and middle-market firms that had inquired about or applied for credit 
improved during the first quarter of this year.  Increases in demand for C&I loans from smaller  
firms and improvements in the credit quality of t hose applicants were reportedly less widespread 
than for larger firms.  Demand for commercial r eal estate (CRE) loans also reportedly increased, 
particularly at larger banks.  In contrast, relatively large fractions noted that demand for each type 
of residential mortgage covered in the survey  had declined.  Demand for auto loans reportedly  
strengthened this quarter, while demand improve d slightly for credit card loans and was little 
changed for other consumer loans. 
LENDING TO BUSINESSES  
Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending 
The survey showed that the market for C&I loans continued to recover in the first quarter 
of this year.  About 15 percent of banks re ported having eased standards on C&I loans to large 
and middle-market firms and to small firms, as did 20 percent of branches and agencies of foreign banks (foreign banks).  No domestic or foreign banks tightened standards on C&I loans during this period, and the easing of standards among domestic banks was somewhat more widespread  
than in the previous survey.   
Positive net fractions of banks eased most loan terms on C&I loans for firms of all sizes.  
The easing of terms was notably more pronounced at larger domestic banks and at foreign banks.  
Loan spreads were eased by somewhat more responde nts than in the previous quarter, with about 
55 percent of domestic banks, on net, narrowing spr eads over their cost of funds on loans to large 
and middle-market firms and 50 percent, on net, na rrowing spreads on loans to small firms.  Both 
of those net fractions are near the highest on record.  Also, about 50 percent of foreign banks reported a net easing of the spreads of loan rates ove r their own cost of funds.  Somewhat smaller 
net fractions of domestic banks lowered the cost of  credit lines and reduced the use of interest rate 
floors (a new loan term  added to this survey) in lending to firms of all sizes.  On net, about 
30 percent of foreign banks reduced the use of inte rest rate floors.  Moderate net fractions of 
larger domestic banks and foreign banks eased loan covenants, with several banks adding 
comments noting the reemergence of syndicated loans with few or no loan covenants.  
4 Large and middle-market firms are generally define d as firms with annual sales of $50 million or 
more and small firms as those with annual sales of less than $50 million.

 Most domestic respondents that had eased standards or terms on C&I loans cited 
increased competition from other banks and nonbank lenders.  About 45 percent of respondents 
also cited a more favorable or less uncertain economic outlook—a smaller fraction than in the 
previous survey.  About 30 percent noted increased liquidity in the secondary market for C&I  
loans, consistent with reports from participants  in the syndicated loan  market.  Only about 
20 percent pointed to an increased  tolerance for risk at their in stitution as a reason for easing, and

only a few banks reported having reduced interest ra te premiums on riskier loans.  Of the five 
banks that reported having tightened one or more lo an terms, all cited a reduced tolerance for risk 
as a factor contributing to the tightening, and most  pointed to a less favorable or more uncertain  
economic outlook, decreased liquidity in the secondary market for C&I loans, and increased 
concerns about legislative changes, supervisor y actions, or changes in accounting standards. 
 A moderate net fraction of domestic respondents—about 25 percent—reported stronger 
demand for C&I loans from large and middle-market fi rms.  However, as in the previous quarter, 
a much smaller net fraction of banks (about 10 percent) reported stronger demand from small 
firms.  Of the banks reporting stronger demand for C&I loans by firms of any size, substantial 
fractions indicated that the greater demand was due  to an increase in customers’ financing needs 
for inventories, merger and acquisition activity, and accounts receivable, as well as to a reduction 
in borrowing from other banks a nd nonbank sources.  The most often cited reason for stronger 
demand noted by larger banks was greater demand for financing merger and acquisition activity, 
whereas for other banks it was a rise in financing needs for inventories.  On net, about 35 percent 
of banks reported a pickup in inquiries from bus iness borrowers about new or increased credit  
lines.  Foreign banks also reported a slight im provement in demand, on net, and a moderate 
increase in inquiries regarding lines of credit. 
Special Question on Changes in the Overall Credit Quality  
of Potential Business Borrowers 
In response to a special question regardi ng changes in the overall credit quality  of 
potential business borrowers over the past three months, about 55 percent of domestic  
respondents reported improvements in the overall cr edit quality of large and middle-market loan 
applicants, whereas only about 35 percent of respondents reported improvements, on net, in the 
overall credit quality of small firms that applied for loans.5  Large domestic banks were 
considerably  more upbeat than their smaller and foreign counterparts re garding improvements in 
the overall credit quality  of business loan applicants, with about 75 percent of the large bank 
respondents reporting that the overall credit quality  of large and middle-market applicants 
improved over the past three months.      
Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending 
In the April survey, most domestic banks reported no change in their standards for 
approving CRE loans; however, a few large banks and foreign banks reportedly eased such 
standards somewhat.  
About 35 percent of domestic banks repor ted having seen increased demand for CRE 
loans—the strongest reading since the mid-199 0s.  Foreign banks reported little change in 
demand for CRE loans on net.  The results for dom estic banks are consistent with reports of 
increased demand for new mortgages to buy  distressed properties, a pickup in multifamily  
5 This special question asked respondents to consider the average credit quality of applications that 
were denied as well as of those that were approved.

construction due to an improvement in fundamentals for that sector, and demand for refinancing 
maturing CRE loans, although many such loans lack  sufficient equity to be easily refinanced.  
Despite the reported pickup in demand for CRE lo ans, the volume of such loans on banks’ books 
continues to decline because so many  of the loans are being charged off. 
LENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS  
Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending 
On net, standards on prime closed-end residen tial real estate loans and home  equity lines 
of credit were about unchanged during the first quarter of 2011.  As in the previous two surveys, about 10 percent of banks, on net, tightened standards on nontraditional mortgages.  The 
tightening of standards on nontraditional mortgages primarily reflected changes at smaller banks; larger banks left those standards about unchanged.   
Moderate net fractions of banks reporte d weakening demand for both prime and 
nontraditional closed-end loans as well as for home eq uity lines of credit.  Demand for closed-end 
loans has now declined for three consecutive quarters, and the week ly bank credit data suggest a 
marked decline in mortgage originations in the first quarter.   
Questions on Consumer Lending 
In the April survey, for the first time, the questions about consumer loans were split into  
three separate categories:  credit card, auto, and ot her consumer loans.  On net, about 20 percent 
of banks reported having eased standards for a pproving credit card applications.  But because this 
easing was concentrated at large banks, credit card standards were eased by respondents accounting for about 65 percent of such loans held  by  banks in the survey panel.  Terms and 
demand for credit card loans were little changed, on balance, over the preceding three months.  However, if the responses are weighted by the outstanding amount of credit card loans held by 
each respondent—as such loans are highly concen trated among larger banks—demand increased 
at banks accounting for about 15 percent of such loans, on net, during this period. 
The net fraction of banks that reported havi ng become more willing to make consumer 
installment loans registered its strongest readi ng since the first half of 1994.  Those responses 
appeared to be reflected in some easing of sta ndards and terms for auto loans, although standards 
and terms for other types of consumer loans we re little changed over the past three months.  
Standards for loans to purch ase new and used autos were ea sed by  about 15 percent of 
banks on net.  As with credit card loans, only  the larger banks in the sample reported having 
eased such standards.  Moderate net fractions of  large banks also eased spreads and other terms 
on these loans.  Other banks eased loan spreads, but other loan terms and lending standards were 
about unchanged.   
Demand for auto loans re portedly strengthened last quarte r, consistent with reports citing 
an improvement in demand as well as easier credit at banks and auto finance companies as factors contributing to recent increases in auto sales.

Special Questions on Changes in Credit Card Applications and in the Overall 
Credit Quality of Applicants  
Banks’ holdings of credit card lo ans continued to decline at a significant pace in the first 
quarter of 2011, even as the number of credit card offers mailed to households returned to levels 
seen before the escalation of the financial crisis  in 2008.  To better understand these trends, the 
survey included two special questions about chang es in applications for new or increased credit  
card lines and in the overall credit quality of app licants over the preceding three months.  Despite 
the increase in credit card solicitation volume and a significant net fraction of larger banks having eased standards, only a modest net fraction of ba nks reported an increase in the number of credit 
card applications over the past three months.  Mo reover, just a small net percentage of banks 
reported an improvement in the credit quality of  individuals or households submitting credit card 
applications during the same period, as consumers likely continued to repair their balance sheets 
and more-creditworthy  househol ds remained less willing to borrow to fund consumption 
spending.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF  FORECAST  UNCERTAINTY  
We continue to see the risks around our projection for economic  activity  as  
elevated relative to the average experience of the past 20  years (the benchmark used by  
the Committee).  As we have emphasized previously, the severe financial  crisis and  
subsequent recession were both large and historically unusual.  As a  result, the relative  
influences of supply and demand in generating the contraction are difficult to gauge, 
implying unusual uncertainty with regard to the level of slack and strength of the  
recove ry.  Moreover, the  pace  at which households and financial institutions will  
continue to repair their balance sheets, and hence the rate at which the associated drag on  
spending  and credit extension will ease, is difficult to assess.  While lending conditio ns  
are  gradually improving a  long the lines  anticipated by the staff, the risks to the outlook 
for credit conditions remain sizable.  We continue to judge the risks to our  projection for  
real activity as roughly balanced:   For example, while spending data have been  
disappointing of late, indications from the labor market, industrial production, and 
surveys of business confidence have remained solid.  
We also continue to see the risks around our inflation projection as elevated 
relative to the experience of t he past 20 years.  The prospects for inflation expectations  
remain highly uncertain, given that the underlying pace of inflation remains at an 
unusually low level, even as commodity prices have moved sharply higher.  The  
difficulties associated with gaugin g e conomic slack in the wake of  an unusually deep 
recession imply larger risks, in both directions, to our assessment of the  role that slack 
will play in influencing inflation going forward.  Moreover, the federal funds rate is  
effectively at the zero lower bound and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is historically  
large.  Prospects for the dollar and hence import prices also remain uncertain.  Finally, under current law, the path for fiscal policy is unsustainable and, with the  prospect for  
resolution murky, some observers worry that this situation could lead to higher inflation.  Weighing these risks to both the upside and downside, we continue to see the risks  
around our inflation projection as roughly balanced.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the  risks to the outlook, we consider several alternatives to 
the baseline projection using simulations of staff  models.  We begin with a simulation in  
which the level of potential output is assumed to be lower currently than in the baseline  
projectio n and policymakers are slow to recognize the less favorable supply- side 
conditions, setting the stage  for higher inflation and weaker activity than in the baseline  
forecast.  We then consider the possibility that we  have underestimated the  underlying  
stren gth of the recovery, and hence the inflation pressures that will emerge  over time.  
The third scenario considers the opposite risk—that we have taken too little signal from 
the recent softness in the  spending indicators, and that the recovery will be  even more 
sluggish than we have projected in the baseline.  The fourth scenario builds on this  
weakness by  further  assuming that, in an environment in which the unemployment rate  
remains persistently elevated, the underlying trend in inflation will continue to  drift down 
noticeably.  The final two scenarios consider the  consequences of higher oil prices under  
different  assumptions about the monetary policy response abroad.  In all of these 
scenarios, monetary policy  responds to movements in real activity  and inf lation as  
prescribed by  a simple policy rule  for the  federal  funds rate, while nontraditional policy is  
assumed to follow the baseline path.1    
Lower Potential 
Estimates of resource utilization are inherently imprecise and we could be 
significantly oversta ting the amount of slack in the economy.  If so, inflationary pressures  
would be stronger than we anticipate, particularly if the public recognizes that monetary  
policymakers are too optimistic about supply- side  conditions.  At the same time, the  
outlook for aggregate spending would be weaker because lower potential output would imply lower long -run household and business income.  In this scenario, the actual output  
gap is currently about 60  percent  as wide as the staff estimates, reflecting a lower level o f 
1 The first scenario is simulated using the staff’s domestic DSGE model, EDO, whose structure 
allows us to model consistently the impact of gradual learning by the monetary authority on private -sector 
expectations.  The following three scenarios are run in FRB/US, while the final pair is run in the 
multicountry SIGMA model. 
The three models employ somewhat different monetary policy rules.  In the FRB/US simulations, 
the federal funds rate follows the outcome -based rule described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B. 
The policy rule in SIGMA is broadly similar but uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between 
actual output and the model ’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of a slow 
adjustment in wages and prices . Finally, monetary policy in EDO is set using an estimated rule in which 
the federal funds rate depends on both core PCE inflation and the deviation of output from its trend.

structural productivity.  Policymakers initially share the baseline view of economic slack, 
but revise their estimates  gradually over the next few  years in response to unexpectedly  
high inflation and weak real activity.  In contrast, firms and households  have a better  
understanding of the true state of supply- side conditions; as a result, they see that 
monetary policy is persistently too accommodative and thus raise their expectations for  
inflation.  In response to a narrower output  gap and higher inflation expectations, core  
inflation climbs to 2½  percent by the middle of next  year and  remains near  that level  
thereafter.  Through 2013, real GDP expands 1 percentage point more slowly per  year, on 
average, than in the baseline as consumption and investment  adjust to the lower level of  
trend output and income; the unemployment rate is also somewhat higher.  Faced with 
both higher inflation and the growing recognition that there is less slack than previously  
thought, monetary policy tightens appreciably faster than in the baseline projection, with the federal funds rate reaching ½ percent by the end of this  year and 1½ percent by the  
end of 2012.   
Stronger Recovery  
In putting together the baseline projection, we have balanced the disappointing  
news on spending against encouraging readings on the labor market, industrial  
production, and business  sentiment.  In this scenario, the latter indicators turn out to be  
correctly signaling that a  more robust expansion is under way than we  anticipate, spurred 
by a mutuall y reinforcing dynamic of improved optimism, higher spending, greater  
hiring, and increasing c  redit availability.  As a result, real GDP rises at an annualized 
pace of 4½  percent in the second half of this  year  and 5 percent in 2012, boosting the  
demand for labor enough to push the unemployment rate down to 7 percent  by late next  
year.  Initially, the stronger pace of the  recovery has little effect on inflation, both 
because higher investment increases labor productivity  and therefore holds down unit  
labor costs, and because long-run inflation expectations are well anchored.  In time, however, tighter labor and product markets cause inflation to move up noticeably more  
than in the baseline.  In response to stronger near- term real  activity, the federal funds rate 
lifts off from zero late this  year.  
Weaker Recovery  
Although recent spending indicators have been unexpectedly soft, we have  
interpreted that weakness as likely to be largely transitory.  In this scenario, however, the  
incoming data signal  a more sluggish recovery in which anticipated improvements in 
credit availability, consumer confidence, and the  willingness of firms to hire are slower to

materialize than in the baseline.  Corporate equity  prices decline rather than rise,  
reflecting  a reduced appetit e for risk as well as poorer economic outcomes, with the result  
that stock market wealth is more than 15  percent below the baseline by the  middle of next  
year.  Lower consumer confidence  and wealth lead households to limit their spending by  
enough to keep the personal saving  rate close to 6 percent.  All told, real GDP advances  
less than 3  percent in both 2011 and 2012 and the  unemployment rate edges down only to 
8½ percent by the  end of  2013.  With greater slack, core inflation declines to about  
1 percent  by 2015, rather than rising to 1½ percent as in the baseline.  Liftoff of the  
federal funds rate from its effective lower bound is delayed until early 2014.   
Weaker Recovery with Further Disinflation  
In the previous scenario, despite persistent economic s lack, core inflation declines  
only slightly because of  well-anchored long-run inflation expectations.  But the relative  
stability of various measures of expected inflation over the past several  years may be 
misleading us about the potential for further dis inflation, particularly if the  
unemployment rate were  to remain very  elevated.  This scenario builds on the previous  
one by  assuming inflation dynamics similar to those in some of the staff’s reduced -form  
price equations.  Accordingly, core inflation falls to around ½ percent by the middle of  
the decade.  Outcomes  for real GDP and unemployment are similar to those in the 
preceding scenario, largely because long -term nominal interest rates decline with actual 
and expected inflation, implying little effective  change in financial conditions.  In the  
face of continued disinflation and high unemployment, the federal funds rate remains  
near zero until late 2014.   
Higher Oil Prices  
Although we project that oil prices will remain near their current level, there is  a 
high degree of uncertainty  around this projection.  An upside risk is that unrest in the  
Middle East and North Africa  could intensify  further, reducing g  lobal oil supplies.  This  
scenario  assumes that oil prices  rise $30 per barrel  above baseline by the end of 2011 
before  gradually receding.  R eal activity  in the United States  is weaker than baseline, 
notwithstanding some improvement in real net exports arising f  rom a slight  endogenous  
depreciation of the dollar, because higher oil prices restrain consume r spending and 
business investment.  All told, U.S. real GDP rises only around 3½ percent  at an annual  
rate in the second half of  this  year and 3¾ percent  in 2012.  Because firms eventually  
pass on some of their higher production costs to households, core inflation runs above  
1½ percent through 2012, ¼ percentage point higher than in our baseline.  Headline

inflation runs at nearly 2¼ percent in the second half of this  year  and then falls to around 
1½ percent next  year.  Monetary policy is little changed from baseline because the 
upward pressure on the  federal  funds rate  from higher inflation roughly offsets the  
downward pressure  from weaker real activity.  
Higher Oil Prices with  Weaker Dollar  
Given that headline inflation is already running at  an elevated level in many  
foreign economies, their  central banks might tighten aggressively in response to a further  
run-up in oil prices.  In addition, in this environment, sentiment toward the dollar could 
weaken as well.  This scenario builds on the previous one by  assuming that foreign 
central banks boost policy  rates 50 to 75 basis points more than in the previous scenario.  
In addition, the dollar falls about 8 percent below  baseline by the end of 2011; about half  
of this decline reflects an endogenous reaction to higher oil prices and higher interest  
rates abroad, while the  remainder reflects the exogenous shift in sentiment away from  
dollar- denominated  assets.  This depreciation of the dollar mitigates the adverse effect of  
the oil price rise on U.S. activity but contributes to greater near- term pressure on  
inflation.  Consequently, the unemployment rate in late 2012 is about 8 percent, 
¼ percentage point above baseline.  Core inflation exceeds 1¾  percent through 2012, 
about ½ percentage point above baseline, while headline inflation runs above 2½ percent  
in the second half of this  year before  falling to about 1¾ percent next  year.  The rise in 
core inflation pulls the liftoff date for the federal funds rate to early 2012.   
OUTSIDE  FORECASTS  
In its April iteration,  the Blue Chip consensus forecast for this  year’s increase in 
real GDP edged down since its March release and is now at 3.1 percent, similar to the  
staff projection of 3.2 percent; the downward revision was concentrated in the first  
quarter, reportedly reflecting the weaker incoming spending data.  The  consensus  
projection anticipates a 3.2 percent  rise in real GDP over the course of 2012,  
1 percentage point below the staff projection.  The Blue Chip forecast for the  
unemployment rate at the end of 2012 is 7.9 percent, 0.2 percentage point higher than the  
staff’s projection.  Regarding inflation, the  Blue Chip anticipates the overall CPI  
increasing 2.9  percent over the four quarters of 2011, about the same as projected by the  
staff.  In contrast, the consensus projection for CPI inflation in 2012 equals 2.2 percent,  
1 percentage point above the staff projection.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
