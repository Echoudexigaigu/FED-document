Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information on economic activity we have received since the April Tealbook 
has been weaker than we had expected.  Part  of the downside surpri se reflects a larger 
transitory effect of the Japan earthquake on second-quarter motor vehicle production than 
we had assumed previously.  But we also re ad the incoming data as suggesting that the 
underlying pace of recovery is less vigorous than we had anticipated in the April 
projection.  In particular, income growth over the fourth and first qu arters is now reported 
to have been substantially weaker than we had thought, employment growth slowed 
noticeably in May, and initial claims for une mployment insurance remain above levels 
reached earlier in the year.  Moreover, consumer spending outside of motor vehicles has increased only modestly in recent months, the construction sector remains depressed, and 
indicators of business sentiment and production have softened of late.  As a result, we 
now project real GDP to increase  at an annual rate of just 2 percent this quarter before 
moving up to a 4 percent pace next quarter, as supply chain disruptions dissipate and 
motor vehicle production rebounds. 
With economic activity showing less momentum than previously seemed to be the 
case, we have revised down our projection fo r output growth over the medium term as 
well.  While the factors driving an expected acceleration in activity over the forecast 
period—accommodative monetary policy, impr oved credit availability, and some  
improvement in business and consumer conf idence—are the same as in previous 
forecasts, the recent data suggest that the pace of the recovery is being held back by some  
combination of less impetus from these fact ors and greater restra ints on spending from 
other factors.  Changes in other key conditi oning factors since th e April Tealbook provide 
a small offset to the apparent ly weaker thrust in economic activity, with reductions in the 
expected paths of interest rates and oil pr ices slightly outweighing lower stock market 
prices in their projected e ffect on output growth.  On ne t, we now expect real GDP 
excluding Japan effects to increase 3 per cent over the second half of the year and 
3½ percent in 2012, both down ¾ percentage poin t from the April Tealbook.  With output 
growth weaker, the unemployment  rate is projected to decline more gradually than in the 
April Tealbook, remaining close to 9 percent for the remainder of this year before falling 
to nearly 8 percent—about ½ percentage point above the Apri l Tealbook projection—by 
the end of 2012.

The incoming data on core inflation have  been above our expectations.  Although 
we still think that part of th e recent acceleration in core prices  reflects transitory factors, 
we have taken a bit more signal from the data for the path of inflation going forward.  In 
contrast, energy and commodity prices have su rprised us to the downside, and we have 
lowered our projection of resource utilization ove r the medium term.  In all, we revised 
up our projection of total PCE inflation 0.1 perc entage point this year , to 2.3 percent, and 
0.3 percentage point in 2012, to  1.5 percent.  The projecte d deceleration in total PCE 
prices largely reflects the expected leve ling out of energy pri ces next year.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
In light of the significantly weaker outl ook for real GDP, offset only in part by the 
upward revision to inflation, we now assume  that the FOMC will hold the target federal 
funds rate in the current range of 0 to  ¼ percent until the fourth quarter of 2012, one 
quarter later than we assumed in the April Tealbook.  Regarding nonconventional 
monetary policy, we assume that the FOMC will complete the expansion of its holdings 
of Treasury securities by the end of this month and will not undertake any further 
portfolio expansion.  In addition, we assume  that the Federal Reserve will reinvest 
principal payments from its securities hol dings until the first quarter of 2012—also one 
quarter later than assumed last round—and then will commence a gradual removal of 
nonconventional policy accommodation by allowing principal payments to reduce its 
securities holdings over time.  
Financial Conditions   
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities  has dropped about 30 basis points since 
the date of the April Tealbook, as market part icipants appeared to become less optimistic 
about the outlook for economic activity and as investor demand shifted toward relatively 
safe assets.  Although we have lowered the pr ojected path of the 10-year Treasury yield 
this round, we continue to antici pate a sizable increas e in that yield over the next year and 
a half.  The projected increase importantly reflects the movement of the valuation 
window through the period of near-zero short-term  interest rates.  In addition, we expect 
the term premium to rise, as the normaliza tion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet 
adds to the available supply of longer-dat ed Treasury bonds, and as investors regain

confidence in the durability of the economi c recovery and reduce their demand for low-
risk assets.  
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds and interest rates on confor ming 
fixed-rate mortgages also decreased over the intermeeting peri od, though by a little less 
than yields on Treasury securities, implying a sm all increase in spreads.  While we raised  
slightly our projection for thos e spreads this round, the projec ted levels of corporate bond 
yields and mortgage rates lie noticea bly below those in the April Tealbook. 
The Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market  Index has decreased about 3 percent 
since the April Tealbook.  This decline left th e projected level of st ock prices at the end 
of this quarter close to 5 percent lower th an we had forecast in the previous round, and 
we reduced the medium-term projection by this  amount.  Nonetheless, we continue to 
expect stock prices to appreci ate at an annual rate close to  9 percent thro ugh the end of 
next year—a pace that we expect to bring the implied equity risk premium down toward 
longer-run norms. 
The latest data from CoreLogic showed  another noticeable decrease in house 
prices in April, but one that was in line w ith our expectations.  Thus, as in the April 
Tealbook, we anticipate that house prices will fall  4½ percent this year and then be little 
changed in 2012. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are unrevised in this projection.  We continue to 
expect federal fiscal policy actions to be a roughly neutral influence on aggregate demand 
in 2011, as the impetus from the one-year cut in payroll taxes is about offset by the 
expiration of the Making Work Pay tax cut at the end of last year and some reduction in 
stimulus-related grants to state and local governments.  In 2012, federal fiscal actions are 
expected to impose a drag on aggregate demand of about 1 percent of GDP, as the 
temporary payroll tax cut expires, the Em ergency Unemployment Compensation program  
is phased out, the stimulus grants for states and localities are esse ntially exhausted, and 
real federal purchases decline.  
Recent income tax collections have been a little stronger than expected, which has 
led us to nudge down our projection of the fiscal year 2011 deficit to $1.3 trillion (about 
8½ percent of GDP) from $1.4 tril lion in the April Tealbook.  Th e deficit is still projected 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Page 4 of 102
Authorized for Public Release
to narrow to $1.1 trillion in fiscal 2012 (about  7 percent of GDP), primarily reflecting the 
further tapering of stimulus-related policies a nd continued gains in tax receipts as the 
pace of economic activity picks up.  Federal de bt is projected to rise to more than 
70 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal 2012.  
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Foreign real GDP accelerated in the first quarter to an  annual pace of 4 percent, 
nearly ½ percentage point grea ter than we projected in Apri l.  Surprisingly strong activity 
in many emerging market economies and the euro area more than offset a much sharper-
than-expected contraction of Japanese activity following the March 11 earthquake.  Data 
through May, however, show a deceleration in global manufacturing activity, and we 
expect foreign GDP growth to step down to a 2¾ percent pace in the second quarter, slightly softer than in the April projection.  As Japan recovers fr om its post-earthquake 
slump and the effects of supply chain disr uptions on other economies wane, foreign 
growth is projected to rebound to 3¾ percent in the third quarter and to average about 
3½ percent for the remainder of the forecast pe riod.  This outlook is a bit lower than the 
April Tealbook projection, largely reflecti ng the lower trajectory for U.S. economic 
activity.  
The starting point of our projected path for the broad real dollar is about 
¼ percent lower than we anticipat ed in the April forecast.  From  this slightly lower level, 
the dollar is assumed to depreciate at an annual rate of about  3 percent over  the forecast 
period, a pace that is little changed from what we had written down in April. Most of the 
dollar’s projected decline occurs agains t the currencies of the emerging market 
economies. 
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
Oil prices have declined since April, with the spot price of West Texas 
Intermediate (WTI) crude oil closing on June  14 at $99 per barrel, $8 dollars per barrel 
lower than at the time of the previous forecast.   The price of all grad es of crude oil fell 
sharply in early May, likely refl ecting diminished expectations  for the strength of global 
oil demand.  Last week, disagreement within OPEC prevented an anticipated increase in 
oil production quotas, but rumors have surfaced that Saudi Arabia may be raising its oil 
production anyway.  Consistent with futures pric es, we project that the spot price of WTI 
will edge up to $102 per barrel by the end of  2012.  Compared with the April Tealbook  
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook

projection, this path is about $10 lower in the second half of this year and $4 lower at the 
end of next year.   
As with oil, prices of many other commod ities, particularly industrial metals, fell 
sharply in early May am
id mounting concerns  about the strength of global demand.  In 
contrast, corn and soybean prices have m oved up in recent weeks on worries about 
growing conditions in the United States.  We  project that nonfuel commodity prices will 
remain near their current elevated levels, c onsistent with quotes from futures markets.  
(See the box “Forecasting Commodity Prices” for further discussion.) 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have revised down our near-term pr ojection of economic activity.  We now 
think that the effects of the Japan disaster will weigh more heavily on U.S. real GDP this 
quarter than we thought at th e time of the April Tealbook, although much of this effect is 
expected to be unwound next quarter.  In a ddition, we have marked down our near-term 
projection of consumption in response to weaker data on real incomes, employment, and 
spending.  In all, we project real GDP to in crease at an annual rate of 2 percent this 
quarter and 4 percent in the third quarter, down ¾ percentage  point, on average, from the 
April Tealbook; excluding the effects of the Japan disaster , real GDP is projected to 
increase around 2¾ percent in both quarters. 
Almost all of the effect on U.S. economic activity resulting from the Japan 
disaster appears to be concentrated in the motor vehicle sector.1  Following the disaster, 
shortages of auto parts forced several Japa nese firms to slow production at their U.S. 
assembly plants this quarter, lowering domestic motor vehicl e production by about 
1 million units at an annual rate.  However,  industry reports suggest that bottlenecks in  
parts supplies have started to ease in r ecent weeks, and assembly plans point to a 
substantial increase of 1½ million units in the third quarter.   
1 We have not yet seen any significant direct effect on domestic IT production from the Japan 
earthquake, but the full ramifications of the disaster are still uncertain.  Alth ough high inventories of 
electronic components have likely mitigated the effects of the disaster, there are still supply chain concerns 
going forward, as manufacturers will soon begin to ra mp up production in advance of the back-to-school 
and holiday season increases in demand. In addition, some major high-tech companies have noted that 
adjusting to the disruptions in the supply chain has been costly.  However, prices for some components that 
had been moving higher in the weeks following the earthquake stabilized in the second half of May.

Forecasting Commodity Prices      
The  Tealbook   forecasts   for  oil  and  non‐fuel  commodity   prices  are  based  on  quotes  from  futures  
markets.   Futures  prices  should,  in  principle,   embody  all  available  information   affecting   commodity   
prices,   including   developments   specific  to  individual   commodities   as  well  as  those  shaping  the  
global  economy   more  generally.    As  is  well  known,  however,   futures  prices  have  a  poor  track  
record  in  predicting   commodity   price  movements.    Here  we  summarize   recent  work  conducted   in  
the  Division  of  International   Finance   to  assess  the  forecasting   properties   of  commodity   futures,  
with   the  goal  of  improving   our  forecasting   methodology.1  
To  assess  the  fundamental   drivers   of  commodity   prices,  we  evaluated   several  reduced‐form  
equations   that  model   commodity   prices  as  a  function  of  macroeconomic   variables.   Although  many  
variables  should  affect   (and  be  affected   by)  commodity   prices,  the  key  determinants   we  identified   
are  world  economic   activity  and  the  exchange  value  of  the  dollar.    In  addition,  activity  in  the  
emerging   market  economies,   which  is  relatively   intensive   in  the  use  of  commodities,   is  particularly   
informative.   
By  incorporating   expectations   about  these   fundamentals,   futures  should  provide  a  reasonable  
forecast  of  commodity   prices.    Yet,  on  average  over   long  periods  of  time,  futures  prices  barely  
outperform   a  random  walk,  as  they  frequently   trace   out  a  relatively   flat  trajectory,   similar   to  a  
random  walk  forecast.   Considering   the  centrality   of  global  economic   growth  to  commodity   prices,  
it  may  appear  surprising   that  futures  curves  remain  flat  even  though  global  demand  is  steadily  
increasing.    Theoretically,   however,   such  a  configuration   of  forward   prices  is  justified  when   market  
participants   can  arbitrage  away  differences   in  spot  and  futures  prices  through  adjustments   in  
commodity   inventories   or  supply  decisions.    For  example,   expectations   that  strong  demand  will  
push  up  commodity   prices  in  the  future  will  induce   market  participants   to  boost  current  holdings  of  
commodities,  thus  pushing  up  spot  prices.   When  eith er  the  costs  or  the  benefits  of  holding  
inventories   are  particularly   high,  however,   futures  prices  can  differ  greatly  from  spot  prices,  
resulting  in  a  meaningful   slope  in  the  futures  curve.   Our  empirical   analysis  indicates   that  futures

prices  outperform   a  random  walk  forecast  by  a  considerable  margin  when  there  is  a  sizable  
difference  between   spot  and  futures  prices.   Thus,  futures  prices  contain  useful  information  for  
forecasting   commodity   prices.    
Where   futures   go  astray  is  that  they  are  often  conditioned   on  expectations   of  the  fundamentals   
that  subsequently   prove  to  be  incorrec t.   As  shown  in  the  lower‐ left  figure  on  the  facing  page,  
market  analysts  repeatedly   underestimated   the  rate  of  growth  in  emerging   Asian   economies   over  
much   of  the  last  decade  as  the  forecast  path  was  regularly  revised   up.   Coinciding   with   these  
demand  surprises,  as  shown  in  the  lower‐ right  figure  on  the  facing  page,  were  analogous   upward  
revisions  to  the  path  of  crude  oil  futures  prices.   Futures  curves  for  other  commodities   were  revised   
in  a  similar  manner.    More  generally,   we  find  that  surprises   to  analysts’   expectations   for  global  
activity  explain  much   more  of  the  variation  in  commodity   prices  than  do  underlying   trends.   
Additionally,   changes  in  the  dollar   (which  presumably  are  largely  unanticipated)   are  also  quite  
influential.     
Based  on  these  results,  we  propose  an  alternative  forecasting   methodology   for  commodity   prices  
to  be  introduced   in  the  August  Tealbook.    It  starts  with  the  futures   curve,   but  then  adjusts   that  
curve  in  light  of  how  much  market  participants   would  be  surprised  if  the  staff’s  Tealbook   forecasts   
of  economic   growth  and  exch ange  rates  prove  correct,  as  determined  by  the  divergence  between  
the  Tealbook   forecast  and  private  forecasts.   As  shown  in  the  two  panels  below,  at  present,  the  
proposed  forecast  for  oil  prices  lies  slightly  above  the  futures  path,  largely  reflecting   the  staff’s  
expectation  of  further  dollar  depreciation.   On  average  over  the  past  decade,  this  alternative  
approach  would  have  done  only  about  as  well  as  simply  using  futures  prices,  as  both  the  staff  and  
private  forecasters  were  surprised  by  the  rate  of  acceleration  in  emerging  market  economies  over  
this  period.   However,  this  alternative  approach  has  the  advantage  that  it  incorporates   both  market  
information  and  the  staff’s  forecast  of  activity   and  exchange  rates  in  a  conceptually  coherent  way.   
An  added  benefit  of  this  approach  is  that  it  provides  a  simple  framework  for  assessing  the  risks  to  
commodity   prices  in  terms  of  their  underlying   drivers.   For  example,  the  dotted  lines  in  the  two  
figures  below  show  a  range  of  oil  price  paths  that  might  prevail  under  different  assumptions   for  
how  market  participants   could  be  surprised  by  the  evolution  of  global  activity   and  the  dollar.

The constraints on motor vehicle produc tion led to a sharp drop in vehicle 
inventories, and days’ supply for domestic auto s dipped to 39 days at the end of April, 
one of the lowest levels on record.  The limited availability of some vehicle models, 
particularly smaller cars produced by the Japanese automakers, curtailed light-vehicle 
sales, accounting for much of the 1¼ million unit drop in May (bringing the total to an  
annual rate of 11.8 million units).  However, so me of the decline in sales may have also 
reflected recent increases in gasoline prices as well as weakness in other factors affecting 
consumer demand.  As production rebounds and i nventories are rebuilt, we project sales 
to move back up to a 13¼ million unit pace in the third quarter.   
The Industrial Sector 
We expect growth in manufacturing IP to step down from a robust annual rate of 
6½ percent in the first quarter (2½ percentage points below our estimate in the April 
Tealbook) to only 1½ percent this quarter.  Although the effects of the Japan disaster on 
motor vehicle production account for much of this deceleration, the most recent 
indicators—such as diffusion i ndexes of new orders from th e manufacturing ISM survey 
and the various regional manufact uring surveys, as well as ad justed orders for durable 
goods—suggest a slowing in the pace of manufact uring activity more broadly.  Given the 
projected rebound in motor vehicle production, we expect manufacturing IP to rise at an 
annual rate of 8½ percent next quarter.  Howeve r, the weaker tone of recent indicators 
has led us to revise down our  projection of the average annual rate of increase in 
manufacturing output outside the motor vehicle sector over the sec ond and third quarters 
to 3¾ percent, ¾ percentage point lower than in the April Tealbook.  
The Labor Market  
After increasing by an average of 200,000 in  the first four months of the year, 
private nonfarm payroll employment increased only 83,000 in May.  The step-down in private employment gains last month was widespread across industries.  Meanwhile, 
employment in the state and local government  sector fell an average of 23,000 in April 
and May, similar to the average pace of  decline since the middle of 2009.  Recent 
indicators of labor market activity suggest that employment grow th in coming months 
will move above the pace in May but fall shy of the increases we had expected in the 
April Tealbook.  Although the help-wanted index remained near recent highs last month 
and initial claims for unemployment insuranc e have moved lower in recent weeks, the 
most recent readings on initial claims are sti ll above levels seen ear lier in the year, and

the pace of hiring remains low.  Factoring in these data, we expect private employment to 
increase 150,000 in June and to average ga ins of about 200,000 per month in the third 
quarter, 50,000 lower than we had writt en down in the April Tealbook.  The 
unemployment rate has hovered around 9 percent since the beginning of the year, and the 
labor force participation rate has been flat at a depressed level.  With labor demand projected to increase only modestly in the ne ar term, we expect the unemployment rate to 
stay near 9 percent through the third quarter and the participation rate to only edge up.   
Household Spending 
Consumer spending looks to be rising at a significantly slower pace in the first 
half of the year than we had expected in  the April Tealbook.  As described previously, 
part of this weakness is due to what we believe to be a temporary reduction in motor 
vehicle purchases.  However, spending for ot her goods and services has also come in 
weaker than expected, as has disposable personal income (DPI).  We estimate that real spending in the control category of personal consumption expenditures increased at an 
annual rate of about 1½ percent in the th ree months ending in May, down noticeably 
from rates around the turn of the year.  More over, the BEA now estimates that real DPI 
increased at only a 1 percent average annual rate over the fourth and first quarters, leaving the published first-quarter level nearly $70 billion lower than we had projected in 
the April Tealbook.  In addition, while the Mi chigan survey’s measure of consumer 
sentiment has reversed some of the plunge in  March that accompanied higher gasoline 
prices, it remains at a low level.   Putting these pieces together, we project that after 
increasing at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first quarter, real PCE will rise a modest 
1½ percent in the current quarter before picking up to a 2½ percent pace in the third quarter as motor vehicle sales step back up.  Our projection of consumption growth in the 
second and third quarters is 1 percentage point  lower, on average, than we had written 
down in the April Tealbook. 
Housing activity remains moribund.  Single- family housing starts edged down to 
an extremely depressed annual rate of about  400,000 units in April.  Similarly, sales of 
new single-family homes remained near recent lows.  High vacancy rates for existing 
homes, tight underwriting standards for mort gage loans, and uncertainty about future 
home prices will likely continue to constr ain demand for new homes over the near term, 
while limited availability of credit for build ers is reportedly impeding supply in the few 
areas where demand is improving.  As a result, we expect single-family housing starts to

remain relatively flat over the near term at a level similar to our projection in the April 
Tealbook.  In contrast, starts in the multifamily  sector are expected to edge up in coming 
months, as demand shifts toward rental units and away from  owner-occupied single-
family homes.    
Business Investment 
After rising at a robust annual rate of 10 percent in the fi rst quarter, real business 
spending on equipment and software (E&S) is  projected to increase 7 percent in the 
current quarter.  Some of the step-down in gr owth reflects the transitory effect of the 
Japan earthquake on business pur chases of motor vehicles.  However, the incoming data 
on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods (excluding aircra ft), together with 
the recent downturn in indicators of business se ntiment, also led us to reduce slightly our 
near-term forecast of spending for other types of business equipment.  In all, we now 
project growth in real E&S spending to pick up to a 13 percent pace in the third quarter— 
boosted by the rebound in motor vehicle purchas es—putting the average rate of increase 
in the second and third quarters at 10 percent, still a robust pace but nonetheless 
2¼ percentage points lower th an in the April Tealbook.   
Real business outlays on nonres idential structures remain at a low level.  After 
falling at an annual rate of 25 percent in the first quarter, ou tlays for buildings appear to 
be edging up in the current quarter.  Howe ver, with financing still tight, vacancies 
elevated, and architectural work for new pr ojects having softened some, we expect 
building outlays to edge lower next quarter.  In contrast, outlays for drilling and mining 
structures rose at an annual rate of 10 percent in the first quarter, and high oil prices and 
recent increases in drilling rigs point to c ontinued strong growth in the second and third 
quarters.     
Inventory investment outside of the motor ve hicle sector is projected to subtract a 
small amount, on average, from real GDP grow th in the second and third quarters.  Book-
value inventory-to-sales rati os outside of the motor vehicle sector remain near pre-
recession norms, and the staff’s flow-of-goods system reveals no evidence of significant 
imbalances.  As noted previously, the effects of the Japan earthquake have led to a sharp 
drop in motor vehicle inventories in the current quarter, but the projected rebound in 
third-quarter production is expected to result  in a substantial rebu ilding of inventories 
next quarter.

Government 
Consistent with incoming data for defens e spending in April and May, we project 
total real federal purchases to rise at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the current 
quarter after falling 8 percent in the first qu arter, when defense expenditures declined 
significantly.  Assuming that defense spendi ng continues to move closer to a level 
consistent with enacted appropriations , we expect real federal purchases to rise at an 
annual rate of almost 5 per cent in the third quarter.   
At the state and local level,  real purchases have con tinued to decrease as budget 
conditions have remained tight.  While recen t declines in state and local employment 
have been about as expected, constructi on spending has been much weaker than 
anticipated, and we now project that real st ate and local purchases will decline at an 
annual rate of about 2 percent in the current  quarter, compared with the roughly 1 percent 
reduction we foresaw in the April Tealbook.  We expect both employment and 
construction spending to continue to fall in th e third quarter; as a result, total real state 
and local purchases are projecte d to contract again next qua rter—albeit less rapidly than 
in the first half of the year.  
Foreign Trade 
Exports were surprisingly strong in March and April, especially in the categories 
of industrial supplies and capital goods.  We now estimate that real exports of goods and 
services rose at an annual pace of 7¾ percent in the first quarter and will accelerate to 
about 10¼ percent in both the second and th ird quarters, supported by continued robust 
foreign demand and the lower value of th e dollar.  These estimates are roughly 
1½ percentage points above t hose projected in April. 
After rising at a 5½ percent annual rate in the first quarter, real imports of goods 
and services are projected to decelerate to a 2¾ percent rate of growth in the current 
quarter.  Our second-quarter projection is down 5 percentage poi nts from the April 
Tealbook, as disruptions to automobile imports from Japan now appear to be more severe 
than we anticipated in April and U.S. econom ic activity is now proj ected to be weaker.2   
2 Some of the downward revision also reflects our expectation that the BEA will change its 
seasonal adjustment of oil imports when it publis hes the advance estimate of second-quarter GDP this 
summer.

For the third quarter, we project that real imports will rebound to close to an 11 percent 
pace, as motor vehicle production in Japan bounc es back and U.S. activity strengthens.   
In the current quarter, we expect the exte rnal sector’s contribution to real G DP 
growth to be nearly 1 percen tage point, compared with a roughly neutral contribution in 
the April Tealbook.  As imports rebound, we expect  the external sector to subtract nearly 
½ percentage point from GDP growth in th e third quarter, little  changed from the 
previous Tealbook.  
Prices and Wages 
Total PCE price inflation is expected to  edge down from an annual rate of 
3¾ percent in the first quarte r to 3½ percent in the current quarter and then to slow 
considerably further to ¾ percent in the third quarter.  The projected step-down in 
inflation over the middle of the year reflect s the recent sharp deceleration in consumer 
energy prices—which is expected to conti nue into the third quarter—as well as a 
projected reduction in food price inflation.  (See the box “The Outlook for Consumer 
Food Prices” for further discussion.)  In re action to higher-than-expected incoming data, 
we have revised up our projection of core PC E inflation ¾ percentage point in the second 
quarter and ½ percentage point in the third quarter, to annu al rates of 2¼ and 1¾ percent 
respectively.  The projected slowing in core PCE inflation next quart er reflects our view 
that some of the step-up in second-quarter in flation is due to transitory factors.  For 
example, extremely low motor vehicle invent ories contributed to higher motor vehicle 
prices in April and May, and this influen ce should lessen as inventories are rebuilt.  
Upward pressures from the prices of commod ities and other imports also appear to have 
been a factor; given the recent drop in commod ity prices, these pressures should start to 
fade in coming months.   
The incoming data on labor compensation have remained quite soft.  Hourly 
compensation in the fourth quarter of 2010 was revised lower after the BEA incorporated 
data from unemployment insurance tax record s and now is estimated to have been about 
unchanged.  Growth in compensation per hour in  the first quarter of 2011, at 2½ percent, 
was also a little weaker than we expected, as  was that quarter’s ri se in the employment  
cost index.  Monthly data on average hour ly earnings through May suggest that 
compensation per hour will increase at annual ra tes of close to 2 percent in the middle 
two quarters of the year.

THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
The accumulation of weaker data on spending and production over the past 
several months suggests less underlying momentum in economic activity than we 
previously thought.  Accordingly, we marked  down our projection of output growth in 
the second half of this year and in 2012.  Th at said, the forces sh aping the recovery and 
its general contour—a gradual and modestly pa ced upturn—are largely the same as in the 
April Tealbook.  Acting to boost growth are accommodative mone tary policy, easing 
credit conditions, and improvements in busin ess and consumer confidence; acting to 
restrain it are the increasing drag from federal fiscal pol icy (reflecting, in part, the 
winding down of grants to state and local governments) and a large overhang of vacant residential and nonresidential buildings.  A ll told, excluding Japa n effects, we now 
project real GDP growth to move up from an annual rate of 2½ percent in the first half of 
this year to 3 percent in th e second half and to 3½ percen t in 2012, with the latter two 
figures both ¾ percentage  point lower than in the April Tealbook.   
A key area of concern is the labor market.  In a more normal economic 
environment, current high levels of profita bility would typically be associated with 
stronger hiring than we have seen recently.  But in the current un certain environment, 
firms seem reluctant to expand their work forces, and—aided, perhaps, by the strong 
bargaining position generated by a depresse d labor market—seem focused instead on 
increasing returns from existing workforces.  As uncertainty about the outlook diminishes 
and credit availability improves, we expect bus inesses to become more aggressive in their 
hiring, leading job growth to gradually strengthen over the medium term.  Nevertheless, 
the recent labor market data have led us to conclude that businesses remain exceedingly  
cautious about adding to payrolls and will rema in so for longer than we had projected in  
the April Tealbook. 
The slow pace of improvement in the labor  market influences our projection for 
consumer spending.  As job growth picks up and the effects of energy price increases 
earlier in the year fade, hous ehold incomes and confidence should rise, driving a modest 
acceleration in consumption over the medium  term.  However, the projected pace of 
acceleration is considerably slower than in  the April Tealbook, with our forecast of 
consumption growth marked down ½ percentage point in the second half  of this year, to 
an annual rate of 2¼ percent (excluding Japan effects), and 1 percentage point in 2012, to 
2¾ percent.  In addition to  the influence of the weaker medium-term paths for

The Outlook for Consumer Food Prices            
After  rising  modestly   last  year,  the  prices  of  PCE  food  and  beverages   have  
accelerated;   we  currently   estimate  that  they  will  have  increased   at  an  annual  rate  
of  about  6½  percent  in  the  first  half  of  this  year.   As  with   energy  prices,  we  view   
these  increases   in  food  prices  as  being  driven  importantly   by  developments   in  
international   commodity   markets.   We  expect  that  food  price  increases   will  slow  
appreciably   in  the  second  half  of  this  year  and  in  2012,  contributing   to  the  
projected   slowdown  of  overall  consumer   price  inflation.     
Farm  commodity   prices  have  surged   over  the  past  year  as  the  emerging   recovery  
in  the  global  economy   has  coincided   with  poor  harves ts  in  several  major  
producing   countries.   For  key  crops   (corn,  wheat,  soybeans,   and  sugar),  prices  
are  up  roughly  60  percent  since  the  middle  of  2010  (the  black  line  in  the  lower‐
left  figure).   Weather  has  been  unusually   troublesome,   causing  the  2010  grain  
harvest  to  drop  below  world  consumption   (lower‐right  figure)  and  pushing  world  
inventories   down  to  very  low  levels.   As  the  extent  of  these  production   shortfalls   
became  apparent   last  year,  crop  prices  moved  up  sharply.   Meanwhile,   livestock  
prices  (the  red  line  in  the  lower‐left  figure)  have  increased   about  40  percent  since  
the  end  of  2009,  owing  to  robust  global  demand  and  the  rising  cost  of  feed  
grains.   
Reflecting   the  recent  surge  in  the  prices  of  crops   and  livestock,  PCE  prices  for  
meats  and  a  wide  range  of  other  more‐processed   foods  have  risen  appreciably    
(see  the  figure  on  the  facing  page).   In  addition,  a  freeze‐related  swing  in  
consumer   prices  for  fruits  and  vegetables—unrelated   to  the  price  increases   for  
other  crops—temporarily   boosted  PCE  food  prices  earlier  this  year.   All  told,  the  
recent  increases   in  the  prices  of  PCE  food  and  beverages   are  estimated   to  
contribute   ½  percentage  point  to  total  PCE  inflation  in  the  first  half  of  this  year  
(right   scale).

 Looking ahead, the relatively  flat trajectories  for crop and livestock  prices implied 
by futures markets appear consistent  with current  U.S. Department of  
Agriculture (USDA)  projections  of expanding  production  of crops and livestock  
this year.  Given the  speed at which farm prices are estimated  to pass through to 
retail prices  of food, we expect that the upward pressure  on consumer  food 
prices coming from farm commodities  will ease  significantly  later this year.  In 
addition, the prices of fruits and vegetables  have already started to retreat  as 
spring‐season supplies have come on line.  In all, food price inflation is projected  
to slow to an  annual rate of about 2½ percent in the second half of this year and  
to rise about in line with core  inflation next year (left  scale).  The deceleration in  
food prices is expected  to contribute  0.4 percentage point to our  projected  
slowing in the overall rate  of PCE inflation.   
While we anticipate that the recent rapid  increases  in food prices will be 
transitory,  significant  risks  are associated  with this  projection.   Given the very low  
levels of inventories  and the mediocre  start for this season’s  grain crop in the 
United States, the  most prominent  risk is that commodity  prices could continue 
to rise appreciably  because of  further adverse supply developments.   While the  
risks at this  point to ou r projected  path for farm commodity  prices seem to be 
skewed to the upside, a significant  chance remains that better‐than‐expected  
growing conditions  over the rest  of the year would boost expected  yields and 
would put downward  pressure  on crop prices.

employment and income growth, the downward adjustment to the consumption outlook 
reflects the lagged effects of the downward revi sions to income in recent quarters and our 
sense that a recovery in consumer confidence will be slower to materialize than we had 
previously been anticipating.  In  this environment, the personal  saving rate is projected to 
remain about flat over the medium term.3  
Rising income and confidence should eventu ally support a gradua l increase in the 
demand for housing as well.  But, with house prices projected to continue declining 
through the first part of next year, demand will likely be restrained by fears of purchasing 
into a falling market.  Moreover, a substant ial part of the expect ed increase in housing 
demand will likely be satisfied by the large stock of low-priced vacant homes and less 
expensive dwellings in multiunit buildings, rather than new single-family housing.  
Indeed, single-family starts are projecte d to move up to an annual rate of only 
500,000 units by the end of next year, less than ha lf of the average rate over the past 40 
years.  We expect residential investment to edge up at an annual rate of about 2 percent 
over the second half of this year and to rise only 6 percent next year, slightly less than our 
projection in th e April Tealbook. 
High vacancy rates, as well as tight fina ncing, will also likely restrain business 
investment in nonresidential buildings over th e medium term.  In addition, because of 
substantial planning lags and ot her factors, the sector typically trails the rest of the 
economy, and we expect this pattern to hold in the current recovery as  well.  As a result, 
we project investment in nonresidential stru ctures to continue to edge lower through 
2012.   In contrast, any overhang in equipmen t and software capital was likely quickly 
eliminated by the dramatic plunge in investment during the recession and by the 
relatively fast depreciation rates of E&S capital.  Thus, as uncertainty about the economic 
outlook diminishes and credit becomes mo re widely available, we expect E&S 
investment to continue its relatively r obust expansion, supported by the resumption of 
projects deferred during the recession as well as the need to replace aging equipment and 
expand capital to keep pace with rising sales.      
In the government sector, budgetary pressu res will likely continue to restrict 
spending over the medium term.  At the fe deral level, a tighten ed environment for 
3 The temporary drop in the saving rate in the fi rst quarter of 2012 refl ects the expected gradual 
response of consumption to the projected sharp rebound in taxes following the expiration of the 2011 
payroll tax cut.

discretionary appropriations, the phasing out  of stimulus-related nondefense spending, 
and anticipated reductions in spending related to overseas military operations are 
projected to cause real federa l purchases to decelerate from a modest increase in the 
second half of 2011 to a small decline in 2012.  At the state and local level, tight budgets 
appear to have exerted more restraint on sp ending than we had anticipated in the April 
Tealbook, and we now expect real state and local  purchases to decrease at an annual rate 
of 1 percent in the second half  of this year, a slightly steeper decline than in the April 
Tealbook.  Although states’ tax receipts have continued to rise and should move up 
further over the projection period, federal stim ulus payments will mostly wind down next 
year, and we project spending in the state and local sector  to be about flat in 2012.  
Net exports are expected to contribute about ½ percentage point to GDP growth in 
both 2011 and 2012, up from
 the April Tealbook la rgely in response to the effect of 
weaker U.S. economic activity on imports.  Continued modest dollar depreciation and 
solid increases in foreign activity should suppor t an annual rate of r eal export growth of 
close to 9 percent over the medi um term.  Real imports are pr ojected to rise at only about 
a 4½ percent pace, on average, over this pe riod, as the effects of strengthening U.S. 
demand are tempered by the drag from the depreciating dollar.   
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION   
Potential GDP and the NAIRU 
We project that potential output  will increase 2¼ percent this year and 2½ percent 
in 2012, and that structural labor productivity wi ll rise 2 percent this  year and next.  We  
have maintained our assumption that the NAIRU will remain at 6 percent through 2012.4   
Productivity and the Labor Market 
After increasing at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the fi rst quarter, labor 
productivity is anticipated to edge down this  quarter; despite the small decline, we judge 
that actual productivity continue s to remain above its structural level.  As firms become 
more aggressive in expanding their workforces  next year, seeking to attract new workers 
4 Our estimate of the “effective” NAIRU, which includes the influence of extended and emergency 
unemployment benefits and is the level of the unemploymen t rate that we view as being consistent with no 
slack in resource utilization, is unrevised from the Ap ril projection and is now about 6½ percent.  As 
before, we expect the effective NAIRU to decline to around 6 percent by the end of 2012 when the 
extended and emergency unemployment benefit programs wind down.

and retain existing ones, they will likely ease some of the pressures on workers that seem 
to have boosted productivity above its struct ural level during the recovery.  Thus, we 
project productivity to in crease at about its structural rate of 2 percent in the second half 
of this year before rising 1¾ percent next year, somewhat  below its structural rate. 
As noted above, our projection of employment  growth is w eaker than in the April 
Tealbook.  Specifically, we now project that average monthly private employment gains 
will edge up from 175,000 in the first half of this year to 220,000 in the second half— 
30,000 less than in the April Tealbook—a nd then to 225,000 in 2012—50,000 lower than 
in our previous projection.  We expect government empl oyment to trend lower through 
the middle of next year.  With job opportuni ties expected to be more limited over the 
medium term, the projected path for the unemp loyment rate is higher than anticipated in 
the April Tealbook.   
Resource Utilization 
Our estimates now show somewhat more economic slack than was anticipated in 
the April Tealbook.  We judge the unemployment  rate to be 2½ percentage points above 
the “effective” NAIRU in the current quarter, an d at the end of next year, we project the 
unemployment rate gap to be 2 percentage points, about ½ per centage point wider than in 
the April Tealbook.  This extended period of labor market slack is likely to be associated 
with below-trend labor force participation, a high per centage of workers who are 
involuntarily on part-time schedules, and an unusually large concen tration of workers 
experiencing long-duration spells of unemploymen t.  Indeed, almost half of all currently 
unemployed workers have been unemployed fo r longer than 6 months.  We have also 
widened our estimate of the GDP gap over th e projection period, leaving the output gap 
at the end of 2012 at 4¼ percent, about ¾ pe rcentage point wider than in the April 
Tealbook.  Capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector retu rns to close to its longer 
run average by the end of 2012.  The difference in  gaps between the i ndustrial sector and 
the economy as a whole reflects more-modest in creases in industrial capacity relative to 
potential output over the recovery  as well as faster growth in industrial output than in the 
rest of the economy.  
Compensation and Prices 
With the unemployment rate projected to be  somewhat higher than in the previous 
forecast over the medium term, we have nudge d down our projection of the increase in 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Authorized for Public Release
compensation per hour in 2011 and 2012, to 2 and 2½ percent respectively.  We have  
also made a small downward revision to our projection of changes in the employment  
cost index.  Given our forecast for pr oductivity, these low projected rates of 
compensation growth limit the anticipated rise  in unit labor costs to ¾ percent in 2011 
and 2012. 
Prices for imported core goods (which  exclude fuels, com puters, and 
semiconductors) are estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 8 percent in the first 
quarter, reflecting the rise in commodity pr ices, elevated foreign inflation, and the 
depreciation of the dollar.  We expect core import prices to post another sizable increase 
in the current quarter and then to decelerate substantially to a rate  of 1½ percent in 2012, 
as commodity prices level out, foreign infl ation subsides, and do llar depreciation slows 
from its brisk pace of the past several quarters.  
Recent readings on inflation expectations have been mixed but generally suggest 
that longer-term expectations have remained stable.  Median 5-to-10-year-ahead expected 
inflation from the Michigan survey was 2.9 percent in May, unchanged from the previous 
month and well within the range seen over the past decade.5  Meanwhile, in the second-
quarter reading from the Survey of Professi onal Forecasters, median expectations of PCE 
inflation over the next 10 years moved up to 2.3 percent from 2.1 percent in the first 
quarter.  In contrast, TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation over the next 
5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead have both declined about ¼ percen tage point since the 
April Tealbook. 
We see the higher-than-expected incoming data on core inflation as suggesting 
that inflationary pressures will be somewhat greater over the medium term than anticipated in the April Tealbook.  However, next  year these influences are partly offset 
in our forecast by the lower projected paths of crude oil and commodity prices and our 
expectation of greater economic sl ack.  On net, we project that core PCE prices will rise 
1.7 percent in 2011 and 1.5 percent in 2012, up 0.3 and 0.1 percentage point, 
respectively, from our previous forecast.   
The contour of core inflation over the me dium term reflects opposing influences:  
With inflation expectations projected to re main stable, the anticipated narrowing of the 
unemployment rate gap implie s a reduction in the downward pressure on production costs 
5 The preliminary reading for June will be published on Friday.

and hence inflation from resour ce slack, but we also expect the impetus to core inflation 
from higher import and energy prices to diminish  as we move into next year.  Reflecting 
an expected deceleration in consumer energy and food prices, headline PCE price 
inflation is projected to step down from 2¼ percent in 2011 to 1½ percent in 2012. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
  Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long 
run, consistent with th e majority of longer-term inflation projections 
provided by FOMC participan ts at the April meeting. 
  The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities follow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B.  The projected longer-run decline in the System’s holdings is forecast to contri bute about 20 basis points to the rise 
in the 10-year Treasury yield over the period from 2013 to 2015.  
 Beyond 2012, risk premiums on corporate equities decline gradually to 
normal levels and banks ease their lendi ng standards somewhat further.   
  As in the April Tealbook, the fede ral government budget deficit (NIPA 
basis) narrows from about 7 percen t of GDP in 2012 to 4½ percent of 
GDP in 2015.  While the effects of th e economic recovery on tax receipts 
make a large contribution to this narrowing of the deficit, about 1 percentage point reflects our assumption of policy actions starting in 2013 that will restrain spending and boos t taxes relative to a “current 
policy” budget.  With this trajectory for the budget deficit, the ratio of debt to GDP would rise from its current le vel of 65 percent to  about 75 percent 
in 2015.  If the budget deficit were to remain around 4½ percent of GDP, 
the debt-to-GDP ratio would continue  to rise, approaching 80 percent by 
the end of the decade.

during the extension period, consistent with futures prices.  Foreign real 
GDP expands, on average, 3¼ percent per year from 2013 through 2015, 
a bit above its trend rate. 
  The NAIRU declines from 6 percen t in late 2012 to 5¼ percent by 2015 
as the functioning of the labor m
arket improves.  Potential GDP expands 
2½ percent per year.  
The economy enters 2013 with  output still considerably  below its potential, the 
unemployment rate well above the projected NAIRU, and inflation below the assumed 
objective.  In the long-run forecast, improvi ng confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and 
supportive financial conditions eventually enab le the level of aggregate demand to catch 
up with aggregate supply.  In this environment, real GDP ri ses at an average annual rate 
of 4¼ percent in 2013 and 2014, considerably fast er than its potential  pace; as a result, 
unemployment declines appreciably and infl ation edges up.  By 2015, with improvements 
in confidence and financial conditions larg ely complete, and with the nominal federal 
funds rate approaching 4 percent, ga ins in real GDP are more moderate.6  Nevertheless, 
overall economic growth remains robust e nough relative to potential to bring the 
unemployment rate close to the NAIRU by la te 2015 while core inflation edges up to 
1.7 percent. 
6 In the long-run outlook, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions of the outcome-based 
rule, which is described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Recent  information on economic activity abroad has been mixed.  Foreign real  
GDP expanded at a 4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, nearly ½ percentage point  
more than we projected in April, as strength in emerging market  economies  (EMEs) and  
the euro area more than offset a sharper -than-expected contraction in Japan  following the  
March 11 earthquake.1   Data through May show  a  softening in  global manufacturing  
activity, and we expect foreign GDP  growth to step down to a 2¾ percent  pace in the  
second quarter .  This slowing was largely  anticipated in the April projection  and mostly  
reflects further  contraction in Japan and moderation in EME growth to a more sustainable  
pace.  As Japan recovers  from its post-earthquake  slump and the effects of  supply  chain  
disruptions on other economies wane, foreign growth is projected to rebound to about  a 
3½ percent  rate for the remainder of the forecast  period .   
This outlook is  a bit lo wer than in the April Tealbook, largely owing to the  
weaker path for  U.S. GDP growth.  However, the  softer tone of incoming U  .S. data  
highlights the possibility  that the pace of recovery  abroad could be substantially weaker 
going forward than we  have written down.  Other  risks are that financial tensions in the  
euro area will intensify if financing for  Greece does not come through as expected and 
that unrest in the Middle East and North Africa  will trigger  another run -up in oil prices. 
Foreign consumer price inflation is expected to ease in the current quarter to an  
annual rate of  around 3 percent  from about 4½ percent in the first quarter, largely  
reflecting a   recent slowing in food and energy  price s, and to average  a little less than  
2½ percent over the rest  of the forecast period.  Emerging market central banks have 
continued to tighten monetary policy to contain inflation.  I n the advanced foreign  
economies ( AFEs ), monetary policy has remained accommodative, although the  
European Central Bank (ECB)  has signaled that it will likely  raise official rates again at 
its  July meeting, and the  Bank of  England (BOE)  and the Bank of Canada (BOC) are  
both expected to raise rates later this  year.   Even so, we now expect the se  central  banks to 
tighten  monetary policy  at a slower pace than assumed in April . 
1 Note that our April Tealbook estimate of foreign growth has been adjusted to be consistent with 
changes in country weights and methodology adopted for the June Tealbook.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES   
GDP in the AFEs rose at  a 2¼ percent  annual rate in the first quarter.  Economic  
performance was uneven across the major  economies, however, with output expanding  
briskly in Canada  and the euro area, rising modestly  in the United Kingdom, and 
contracting in Japan.  As projected in the April Tealbook, incoming data are consistent  
with a step -down in GDP growth to about 1½ percent in the second quarter, with a ctivity  
being held down in Japan and elsewhere by supply chain disruptions associated with the  
earthq uake.  GDP  growth is expected to rebound to about a 2¼ percent pace over the 
remainder of the forecast  period as these disruptions wane.  Relative to the  April 
Tealbook, our GDP outlook for 2012 is slightly  weaker,  largely  reflecting some modest 
drag from a softer U.S. outlook. 
We estimate that AFE headline inflation fell to 2½  percent in the second quarter  
from a first -quarter  rate of 3½ percent, which had been boosted in part by the January  
VAT increase in the United Kingdom.  The appreciation of AFE currencies  in recent  
months and the fall in oil prices should lead inflation to moderate further, to 1¼ percent  
in the third quarter, a bit  lower than previously anticipated, and to average just below  
1½ percent  over the remainder of the forecast period.   
Japan  
The March 11 Japanese earthquake disrupted  economic activity more severely  
than we had anticipated in the April Tealbook.  Japanese  GDP  dropped 3.5 percent in the  
first quarter,  a  substantial slide given that pre- earthquake data were consistent with a 
moderate expansion.  As  a result of damaged production facilities and disrupted supply  
chains, real merchandise  exports dropped 14 percent over March and April  even as  
imports were little changed, indicating that the external sector will likely be a major drag  
on second -quarter GDP.  More recent news has been encouraging, however.  R eal  
consumption rose 2½ percent in April.  Industrial  output, which had  plumm eted in  
March, edged up in April, and manufacturers  reported plans for increasing pr  oduction by  
16 percent over May  and June.  In addition, the electricity shortages  expected this  
summer should be less severe than previously  feared.  The resumption in economic  
activity should also benefit from a surge in government spending as  well as from a  
bounceback in exports and inventory  accumulation.

All told, data suggest that activity bottomed out in April and that a recovery  is  
already under way.   Even so, we expect real GDP to decline 3¾ percent in the second 
quarter, a touch weaker than in the April Tealbook forecast, because of the plunge in 
output in March.  Although we revised up the pace of the rebound from the earthquake, the level of real GDP at the end of 2012 is forecast to be 1 percent lower than in the  
previous Tealbook, mainly reflecting the  larger -than-expected effect of the earthquake.  
Japanese consumer prices rose nearly ½  percent in the first quarter,  boosted by  
commodity price increases, but  we pr oject deflation to return in the current quarter and to 
persist  at about a ½ percent rate this year and next.  
We co
ntinue to assume that the Japanese Diet will approve a fiscal stimulus  
package equivalent to 1 percent of GDP later this  year.  Monetary poli cy should also 
become more supportive of activity,  as we expect the Bank  of Japan to increase the size 
of its asset purchase program from ¥10 trillion to ¥15 trillion (about $180 billion, or   
3 percent of GDP) in the  third quarter.  
Euro Area  
Euro -area GDP expanded  at a stronger -than-expected 3.4 percent pace in the first  
quarter , largely reflecting strong domestic demand.  Germany and France pos ted  
6 percent  and 4  percent  growth respectively.  GDP  managed  mild increases  in Italy, 
Spain, and Greece but contracted in Portugal.  
With the run-up in euro-area  growth in the first quarter boosted in part by a  
rebound in construction after severe weather at the end of last  year, we  expect GDP  
growth to slow to 1½ percent in the second quarter.  Recent indicators support our  
expectation of slowing, as business confidence and the composite PMI declined in May, albeit  to a level  consi stent with  moderate expansion .  In addition, the underlying trend of  
retail sales is weak, consumer confidence has been flat, and the unemployment rate  
remains near its peak.  We project that GDP  growth will average 1½ percent in the 
second half of 2011 as restrictive f iscal policy, tight bank lending c  onditions, and a strong  
currency weigh on the  recovery.  GDP growth should rise to 2¼ percent by  the end of  
2012 as some of these headwinds dissipate. 
Sovereign spreads over  German bunds for Greece, Portugal, and Ireland rose  
sharply  as investors worried about a potential restructuring of Greek debt (see the box  
“Developments in Greece”) , although spillovers to Spain, Italy, and core European banks

Developments in Greece      
Greek  sovereign  spreads  have  soared  to  new  heights  since  mid‐April   (see  lower‐
left  figure  on  the  facing  page),  reflecting   mounting   concerns   about  the  
government’s   ability  to  finance  its  debt.    Greece’s  planned  return  to  the  market  
next  year   for  substantial   medium‐ and  long‐term  debt  financing   (see  lower‐ right  
figure  on  the  facing  page)  now  seems  highly  unlikely.    The  country  is  scheduled   
to  run  out  of  funds  by  mid‐July  without  the  next  disbursement   under  its  
European   Union–International   Monetary   Fund  (EU‐IMF)  program,  but  the  IMF  
has  indicated   it  will  not  be  able  to  approve  further  disbursements   until  a  plan  for  
filling  the  financing   gap  for  at  least  the  next  12  months  is  in  place.   In  recent  
weeks,  European   officials,  the  IMF,  and  the  Greek  government   have   been   
negotiating   over  additional   fiscal  measures,   enhanced   official‐sector  financing,   
and  potential   burden   sharing  with   private  creditors   in  order  to  fill  the  financing   
gap.    
On  June  3,  the  European  Commission,   the  European   Central  Bank  (ECB),  and  the  
IMF  reached  preliminary   agreement  with   Greek  authorities   on  stepped‐up  
policies  to  meet  program   objectives.    First,  the  government   committed   to  further  
austerity  measures   to  reduce  its  deficit  to  7½  percent  of  GDP  in  2011  and  to  below  
3  percent  of  GDP  by  2014.   These  measures   include  significant   public‐sector  job  
cuts,  a  ration alization  of  entitlements,   reductions   in  tax  exemptions,   and  
enhanced   efforts  to  fight  tax  evasion.   Second,   the  government  agreed  to  
increase  and  accelerate  its  privatization  program,  which  now  aims  to  raise  
revenues   of  €50  billion   by  the  end  of  2015.   Third,  the  government   will  continue  
structural   reforms  designed  to  reinvigorate  growth.    However,  as  of  this  writing,  
securing  approval  by  the  Greek  Parliament  appears   to  be  a  substantial   political  
challenge,   and  a  parliamentary   vote  is  not  expected   until  late  June.     
To  further  address  the  Greek  government’s   financing   gap,  since  May,  European  
policymakers   have  publicly  debated   whether   a  restructuring   of  Greek  debt  owed   
to  the  private  sector   should  be  pursued  in  tandem  with  enhanced   official‐sector   
support.   Some  officials,  notably  the  German   finance  minister,  have  advocated   a  
limited  restructuring,  possibly  via  bond  swaps   to  extend   the  maturity  of  
outstanding   Greek  sovereign  bonds.   However,  officials  at  the  ECB  have  
repeatedly  declared  their  opposition   to  such  a  restructuring,  warning  of  dire  
consequence s  for  the  financial  stability   of  the  euro  area.   Moreover,  they  have  
even  threatened  to  stop  accepting   Greek  bonds  as  collateral  if  rating  agencies  
conclude  that  a  restructuring   constitutes   default.   Some  officials   at  the  ECB  have  
instead   expressed  openness  to  a  less  coercive  approach,  such  as  encouraging   
financial  institutions   to  voluntarily   maintain  their  credit  exposures  to  the  Greek   
government.

A  plan  to  fully  address   Greece’s  financing   needs  has  yet  to  be  finalized.    Our  
forecast  for  the  euro  area  assumes  that  European   authorities   ultimately   manage  
the  Greek  debt  crisis  in  a  manner  that  limits  broader  disruptions.    In  the  near  
term,  we  expect  that  additional   official  financing   will  be  pledged  in  time  to  avert  
a  disorderly  default  in  July,  likely  involving   an  expression   of  intent  to  elicit  
contributions   from  private  creditors.   Although  some  combination   of  additional   
official  financing,   private‐creditor  contributions,   privatization   receipts,  and  fiscal  
measures   may  cover  Greece  for  some  time  to  come,  ultimately,   more  ambitious   
steps  will  likely  be  needed  to  put  Greec e’s  debt  on  a  sustainable  basis.

have been modest.  Notably, Portugal’s spreads climbed even though it secured a  
€78 billion ($114 billion) financing package  from  the European Union (EU) and 
Inter national Monetary Fund.  EU policymakers have  yet to implement their pledge  made 
earlier in the spring  to increase the effective lending capacity of the European Financial  
Stability  Facility  (EFSF)  to €440 billion.  Moreover, they have not  yet reached agre ement  
on key terms of the European Stability Mechanism,  the EFSF’s permanent successor .  
Euro -ar ea 12 -month consumer price inflation edged down to 2.7 percent in May.   
Looking ahead, we expect headline inflation to moderate to 1¾ percent in 2012 amid 
lower  energy prices and persistent slack.  The ECB left its key policy rate  unchanged at  
its June  9 meeting, but  President Trichet signaled that a rate increase was likely in July.   
In addition, he announced that the ECB will continue to conduct its refinancing  
operations as fixed -rate tenders with full allotment at least until this fall.   We now expect 
the ECB to raise its  main policy rate to 2  percent by  the  end of 2012, ¼ percentage point  
less than assumed in the  April Tealbook.  
Canada  
Canadian GDP expanded  3.9 percent in the  first quarter, boosted by strong  
investment activit y and faster inventory accumulation.  Output should expand at a more  
moderate 2¼ percent pace in the second quarter, ¼ percentage point less than projected  in 
the April Tealbook.  Although employment and production advanced through May, soft er  
U.S. demand for Canadian exports and the  more disruptive  effect  of the Japanese 
earthquake on Canadian automobile production likely weighed  on activity.  Going  
forward, we  expect Canadian GDP growth to hover around 2½ percent.   
Twelve-month headline inflation edged up to 3.4 percent in April, boosted by 
higher  gasoline prices.  Excluding volatile components and taxes, inflation remained 
contained at 1.7 percent.  The Bank of Canada kept it s target rate unchanged at 1  percent  
in May and stated that  excess capacity is rapidly vanishing.  However, the BOC  also  
stressed the downside risks to growth presented by  a strong c  urrency.  This concern, 
along with subdued core  inflation and a softer  U.S. outlook, led us to pencil in a slightly  
slower  rise in policy  rates  over the forecast period. 
United Kingdom  
U.K.  GDP rose  a disappointing 1.9 percent in the first quarter, barely enough to 
erase its losses from the  previous quarter.  Consumption was pushed down by the January

value-added tax hike, and construction spending c  ollapsed.  Some rebound in 
construction should help lift GDP growth to about 2¼ percent in the second quarter , but  
incoming data on employment and production have been softer than anticipated.  Going  
forward,  domestic demand growth is projected to remain weak as  government spending  
falls and households  further repair their balance sheets.  External demand  should offer  
some relief as  U.K. exporters continue to take  advantage of the  low value of  sterling .  
Even so, GDP growth  averages only  2¼ percent  this  year and next .  
Headline inflation  remained at  4.5 percent in  May on a 12-month basis  and  is 
projected to stay near that level for most of this  year, before tumbling toward the  
2 percent target as the effect s  of tax increases, energy price hikes,  and the weak sterling  
dissipate.  Although oil prices have receded of late, there remains a risk that utility  
companies could hike  prices  later this  year to reestablish margins.  Given  weak  domestic  
demand and downside  risks to growth stemming from fiscal consolidation plans, we now  
expect the BOE  to lift the  bank r ate to  only 1½ percent by the end of 2012,  ¼ percentage  
point less than assumed in the April Tealbook.  
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES   
Aggregate  real GDP in the EMEs expanded at a strong 6¼ percent pace in the  
first quarter, 1 percentage point faster than estimated in the April Tealbook.  We expect  
growth to moderate in the current quarter, albeit to a still-solid rate of 4½ percent.  Th e 
slowing partly reflects a  step-down from the unsustainable pace of  growth in the   
first quarter,  and we had  anticipated  some of that in the April Tealbook.  In addition, we  
have lowered our second- quarter projection a little in reaction to softer reading s on 
exports, industrial production, and PMIs, which likely reflect spillovers from Japan’s  
earthquake and slower U.S. growth.  In the third quarter, we see  EME  growth rebounding  
to 5½ percent, up ½ percentage point from our previous projection, as U.S. gr owth  
improves and the Japanese earthquake effects unwind.   Thereafter,  we see growth  
averaging r  oughly 5 percent, close to potential and slightly lower than the  April Tealbook 
forecast, reflecting the markdown in the path for  U.S. GDP growth.  
We project i nflation in the EMEs to decline further in the current quarter to an 
annual rate of 3¼ percent  from  5¼ percent in the first, reflecting the general easing of  
commodity prices.  With little slack remaining, inflation is projected to  bottom out  at  
about 3 pe rcent  through 2012.  Since the time of the April Tealbook, central banks in 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

several EMEs  have tightened monetary policy, and we expect further tightening over the  
forecast period to keep inflation in check.  
China    
Chinese economic growth appears to be slowing in line with our projection in the  
April Tealbook, owing to tighter monetary policy  and the effects of the Japanese 
earthquake.   We estimate that real GDP is  expand ing  at  an 8  percent pace in the current  
quarter, down from 8¾ percent in the  first.  Although the trade surplus widened over  
April and May, industrial production growth moderated  and the PMI  edged down.  In the  
second half of the  year and in 2012, we expect real GDP growth of 8½ percen t, with  
Chinese monetary policy walking a   fine line between allowing the economy  to overheat  
and pushing down growth too sharply.  
The People’s  Bank of China raised the reserve requirement ratio another  100 basis  
points  since April .  The renminbi has appreciated about 1 percent against the dollar  since 
the April  Tealbook and about 5 percent over the past  year, but it has depreciated on a real  
trade-weighted basis since last June.  We assume that t he Chinese authorities will allow a  
gradual appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar over the forecast period, resulting  
in a real effective appreciation as well.  
In May, headline inflation ticked up to 5.5 percent  on a 12-month basis, but  
monthly  increases in prices have been moderating.   With the economy having slowed in 
recent quarters, monetary policy continuing to tighten, and global commodity  prices  
lower , inflation should fall to 2¾ percent next  year.  
Other Emerging Asia  
Elsewhere in  emerging Asia,  GDP  growth was surprisingly buoyant in the first  
quarter , with India, Hong Kong, and Taiwan all posting double-digit increases .  In the  
current quarter,  we expect some payback , as  well as a drag from the deceleration in  
global activity and spillover effects of Japan’s  earthquake, to slow growth in the region to 
about 4 percent; r ecent data on exports, industrial production, and PMIs  have come in  
soft.  Beyond this quarter, growth should move back up to average about 4¾ percent over  
the forecast period .  This  projection is ¼ percentage point  lower  than the April Tealbook 
forecast  in reaction to the weaker path for  U.S. growth.     
We estimate that inflation in the region will decline sharply to an annual rate of  
2¾ percent in the  current quarter from 7 percent in the first, as food price  pressures have

dissipated.  We expect inflation to average about 3 percent  for the remainder of  the 
forecast period, restrained by monetary policy tightening.  Central banks in India, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand have raised policy rates since the  
time of the April Tealbook.  
Latin America  
Economic performance in Mexico has con tinued to lag that of other EMEs, with  
reported real  GDP increasing at an  annual rate of  only 2 percent in the first quarter, 
although monthly indicators pointed to somewhat greater underlying strength.  Accordingly, we estimate that growth picked up to 3 percent in the second quarter.  This  
estimate is ¾ percentage  point less than in the April Tealbook, as problems  obtaining  
supplies from Japan depressed auto exports and U.S. manufacturing activity  was marked 
down.  With the unwinding of the Japanese effec t and the accompanying  bounceback in 
U.S. manufacturing, we expect Mexico’s growth to rebound to 5 percent in the   
third  quarter, about 1½ percentage points higher than previously projected.  Thereafter, 
growth should moderate  to about 3¾ percent.  
Real GDP  in South America  grew  at a surprisingly fast 7 percent pace in the   
first quarter.  We expect  growth to step down to a  still healthy  4¼ percent in the  
second quarter, partly reflecting reduced impetus from commodity prices, and to remain near  this pace in  the second half of this  year  and in 2012.  
We expect inflation in Mexico to decline to an annual rate of 2 percent in the 
current quarter  from 3½ percent in the  first, largely  reflecting lower food prices.  With 
food prices  bottoming out and core prices continuing to rise, we project Mexican inflation 
to average 3¾ percent over the remainder of the forecast period.  In South America, by  
contrast, we  expect inflation to decline from an estimated 6½ percent in the current  
quarter to a relatively high rate of  5½ percent in the second half of this  year and in 2012.  
Reflecting continued concerns over inflationary pressures, central banks in Brazil, Chile, and Colombia have raised their policy  rates since  the time of the April Tealbook.

Financial Developments 
The economic news received  over the intermeeting pe riod indicated that the 
recovery in economic activity was proceeding at  a slower pace than market participants 
had anticipated, prompting a broad pullback from  riskier financial asse ts.  Concerns about 
a moderation in global growth and the challenges faced by peripheral European 
economies also weighed on market sentiment.  The expected path for the federal funds 
rate, yields on nominal Treas ury securities, and TIPS-based inflation compensation all 
declined appreciably.  Equity markets saw a broad selloff, and spreads between yields on 
corporate bonds and those on comparable -maturity Treasury securities widened. 
Information on credit flows and financ ial intermediation over the intermeeting 
period suggests that financing flows remained supportive of growth outsi de of real estate 
sectors that remain under stress.  Since th e April FOMC meeting, most indicators of 
business credit quality have improved further.  Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations has been robust,  driven by record-high bond issu ance in May.  Commercial 
and industrial (C&I) loans have also incr eased briskly in recent months, though overall 
bank lending was about flat, held down mainly  by declines in holdi ngs of real estate 
loans.  Real estate price inde xes hit new post-crisis lows in April, and both residential and 
commercial mortgage debt contracted further in the first quarter of this year.  M2 
continued to grow at a robust pace in April and May, fueled again by solid increases in 
liquid deposits and currency. 
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Money market futures rates and Treasury yields declined modestly following the 
release of the April FOMC statement and the Chairman’s subsequent press briefing; these 
communications suggested a somewhat weaker  outlook than investors had anticipated.  
Interest rates declined significantly further over the remainder of the intermeeting period, 
as the majority of economic data were more downbeat than had been expected. 
Both the mean and modal paths of the exp ected federal funds ra te over the next 
two years moved down over the period.1  The mean path implied by futures quotes (with 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 9 basi s points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 3 basis points.

the usual staff assumptions for term premiums ) now rises above the current target range 
in the third quarter of 2012, two quarters late r than at the time of the April FOMC 
meeting.  The modal path for the federal f unds rate derived from interest rate caps 
suggests that the policy outcome market pa rticipants now see as most likely would 
involve no liftoff before mid-2013.  The smaller decline in the modal pa th relative to that 
in the mean path likely reflects a drop in the perceived probability  of aggressive policy 
tightening in 2012.  Staff analysis  suggests that part of the decrease in futures rates might 
also reflect a lower term premium, consistent with the decline in market-based measures 
of policy uncertainty over  the intermeeting period. 
Results from the Open Market Desk’s latest survey of primary dealers also 
suggested a modest decline in the anticipa ted policy path, with the second and third 
quarters of 2012 seen as the m
ost likely time  for liftoff—about one quarter later than at 
the time of the April survey.  Respondents did not anticipate ma jor changes to the 
language of the statement at the upcom ing FOMC meeting beyond an acknowledgment 
of the softness in recent economic data.  Dealers revised up slightly their forecasts of core 
PCE inflation through 2012 and downgraded so mewhat their forecasts of GDP growth 
over the same period.   
Yields on nominal Treasury securities fell significantly, with  5- and 10-year 
yields decreasing about 35 basis points and 25 basis points respectively.  Market-based 
measures of uncertainty about long-term Tr easury yields edged up slightly on net.  
Despite speculation by some inve stors about the potential for a jump in Treasury yields 
following the completion of the Federal Rese rve’s $600 billion purchase program at the 
end of this month, futures and options quotes do  not suggest that much weight is attached 
to such a scenario.  Moreover, as discusse d later in the box “Debt Subject to Limit,” 
investors do not appear to be pr icing in any financial market disruption that could result if 
the debt ceiling were not increased prior to the anticipated exhausti on of the Treasury’s 
“extraordinary measures” in early August. 
TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead 
decreased about 25 basis points and 15 basis points respectively.  St aff models suggest 
that the decrease in inflation compensation reflects both lower expected inflation and 
lower inflation risk premiums.  A lower path for expected inflation is consistent with the 
weaker-than-expected economic data and the decrease in oil and ot her commodity prices

over the period.  Swap-based measures of in flation compensation also declined, though 
by a touch less than TIPS-based measures.  
ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS   
In response to the disappointing econo mic data, broad stock price indexes 
dropped about 4½ percent, on net, over the inte rmeeting period.  Stock prices of financial 
firms underperformed the broader market, and some of the largest banks’ CDS spreads 
widened, reflecting the weaker economic outlo ok, potential credit rating downgrades, and 
the heightened concerns about the expected capital surcharge for systemically important 
financial institutions.  Even so, option-imp lied volatility on the S&P 500 index moved up 
only modestly.  The staff’s estimate of the spr ead between the expected  real equity return 
for the S&P 500 index and the real 10-year  Treasury yield—a gauge of the equity 
premium—widened noticeably.   
The broad pullback from risk also affected  legacy RMBS and CMBS markets.  In 
recent weeks, as investors tried to reduce their exposures to these assets, liquidity dried 
up in these markets and CDS index prices of legacy MBS declined.  The price declines 
were reportedly exacerbated by the Federal Re serve sales of mortga ge securities in the 
Maiden Lane II LLC portfolio. 
Yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds fell modestly over the period, and those on 
speculative-grade corporate bonds moved a bit higher; thus, across the rating spectrum, 
spreads relative to yields on comparable-m aturity Treasury securities widened.  In the 
secondary market for syndicated loans, c onditions changed little over the intermeeting 
period, with the average bid price for levera ged loans holding about steady in a range 
near par.   
Conditions in short-term funding ma rkets were little changed over the 
intermeeting period.  Spreads between Libor and OIS rates edged down at one- and three-
month tenors and were generally fairly low.   Activity in markets for repurchase 
agreements was up slightly over the interm eeting period, although it remains below the 
post-crisis peak of last November.  On net over the intermeeting peri od, spreads of yields 
on A2/P2-rated and asset-backed commercial paper relative to those on AA-rated paper were stable at low levels, while spreads for financial institutions with parents based in 
peripheral European countries remained elev ated.   Quarter-end pressures in money 
markets appeared quite muted.

Overall, respondents to the June 2011 Se nior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on 
Dealer Financing Terms pointed to a con tinued gradual easing in credit terms with 
respect to major classes of counterparties over the past three months (see the appendix).  
Dealers also noted that demand for funding for almost all types of securities (with the 
exception of equities) had increased over th e same period.  In response to a special 
question, the current use of le verage was generally charac terized as “roughly in the 
middle”—that is, between the pre-crisis peak and the post-crisis trough.  In recent weeks, 
however, against a back drop of weak performance and in creasing uncertainties about the 
pace of the economic recovery, levered investor s have reportedly pulled back from risk-
taking and reduced their exposures.   
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS   
Investor concerns about an apparent moderation in the pace of global growth have 
weighed on foreign equity prices and bond yi elds over the intermeeting period.  At the 
same time, ongoing concerns about the possibility of a Greek debt re structuring added to 
the market’s sense of risk and placed downward pressure on the euro.  
In response to signs of a global slowdow n, headline equity indexes have fallen 
between 3 and 6 percent in most economies, and 10-year sovereign yields have fallen 
10 to 20 basis points.  The anticipated pace of monetary policy tightening in the advanced 
foreign economies has also been pared back.  Market-based expecta tions of policy rates 
at the end of 2012 are now 40 to 60 basis point s lower for the ECB, the Bank of England, 
and the Bank of Canada.  
The dollar appreciated over most of May as concerns  about peripheral Europe 
prompted some flight to safety, halting seve ral months of dollar depreciation.  However, 
relatively weak U.S. economic data helped  push the dollar down later in the period, 
leaving the broad nominal dollar index littl e changed, on net, since the April FOMC 
meeting. 
Spreads of yields on Greek, Irish, and Po rtuguese sovereign debt over yields on 
German bunds rose to record highs over th e period.  There were also signs of some  
increased funding pressures in Europe, as im plied basis spreads fr om euro–dollar foreign 
exchange swaps widened for most of the pe riod.  Implied volatilities on the euro–dollar 
exchange rate and European equity markets also increased.  These measures reversed

some of their increases as a new package of aid for Greece appeared more likely, but they 
began to rise again as negotiations bogged down.  
Flows to emerging market equity funds turn ed negative in May as investors’ sense 
of risk increased, but inflows resum
ed mode stly in June and several emerging market 
monetary authorities apparently  stepped up intervention to re strain appreciation of their 
currencies.  Monetary authorities in China fu rther increased required reserve ratios, and a 
number of other central banks in the emer ging market economies also continued to 
tighten policy.   
Foreign official purchases of U.S. secu rities were robust in April, but data on 
custody holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York suggest that the pace of these 
purchases softened again in May.  Foreign priv ate investors have shown little appetite for 
U.S. debt securities this year, but their purch ases of U.S. equities have remained strong. 
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Net debt financing by nonfinan cial corporations was robus t in April and surged in 
May.  Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial co rporations hit a record high in May, 
reflecting very strong issuance of investment-grade bonds and record -high issuance of 
speculative-grade bonds, before slowing somewh at in early June.  The strength in bond 
issuance appears to have been driven mainly by firms’ desire to refinance existing debt 
and lock in new funding at current low yields .  In addition, in recent months, speculative-
grade issuance earmarked for acquisition activity  for and payments to equity holders has 
increased.   
Nonfinancial commercial paper and C&I lo ans outstanding posted solid gains in 
April and May.  Supported by strong demand for floating-rate assets from institutional 
investors, issuance of syndicated leveraged lo ans reportedly continue d to be robust over 
the two months.  Refinancing deals remain the main driver in the market, but M&A 
activity appears to be picking up.  In addition, the CLO market ha s shown modest signs 
of revival, as a few new CLOs have  been brought to market lately.  
So far this year, gross pub lic equity issuance by nonfinancial firms has maintained 
a solid pace, boosted by strength in IPOs.  In the first quarter, net equity issuance 
remained deeply negative, reflecting the c ontinued strength of share repurchases and 
cash-financed mergers.  Announcements of share repurchases and cash-financed mergers

suggest that net equity issuance may move deeper into negative territory in the second 
quarter. 
Aggregate operating earnings per shar e for S&P 500 firm s increased a brisk 
6 percent at a quarterly rate in the first quarter of 2011.  Ov er the four weeks ending in 
mid-May, Wall Street analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms 
continued to be revised up; however, our i ndicators suggest that the streak of positive 
revisions may end this month. 
Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms improved further over the 
intermeeting period.  Liquid assets remained at  record-high levels in  the first quarter, and 
leverage, as measured by the aggregate debt-to- asset ratio, has yet to turn up.  In April 
and May, many more nonfinancial corporate bonds were upgraded than downgraded, and 
the six-month trailing bond default rate for nonf inancial firms remained close to zero.  
The delinquency rate on C&I loans fell again in the first quarter—to about the middle of 
its range over the past two decades.  
There continue to be tentative signs of  stabilization in commercial mortgage 
markets.  In recent months, delinquency rates for commercial real esta te loans have come  
off their recent peaks.  However, commercial real estate markets remain extremely weak.  
Property sales have been tepid, prices have remained at depressed levels, and mortgage 
debt has continued to contract .  Issuance of commercial CMBS slowed somewhat in the 
second quarter.  In addition, CDS index prices of legacy CMBS have retreated noticeably since the April FOMC meeting, in  part reflecting the broader pu llback from risky assets.   
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Mortgage interest rates and yields on current-coupon agen cy MBS declined 
during the intermeeting period, roughly in line with the decrease in longer-term Treasury 
yields.  Mortgage refinancing activity e dged up in recent weeks but remained subdued  
because of tight underwriting and low levels of home equity. 
Mortgage debt contracted further in the first quarter of 2011.  Amid a large 
inventory of unsold properti es and tight mortgage underw riting, the CoreLogic repeat-
sales house price index fell in April for the 11th consecutive mont h, reaching its lowest 
level since 2003.  Rates of serious mortgage  delinquency—defined as the percentage of 
mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or in foreclosure—for subprime and prime

mortgages were little changed at elevated le vels.  The rate of new delinquencies on prime 
mortgages ticked up in April but remained we ll below the level of a few months ago.  
Delinquencies on FHA-backed mortgages declined noticeably in March and April. 
On the whole, conditions in consumer credit markets have continued to improve.  
Consum
er credit increased at an annual rate of 3 percent in April, reflecting another solid 
gain in nonrevolving credit and a contraction in revolving credit that was much smaller 
than in previous quarters.  Over the in termeeting period, issuance of consumer credit 
ABS remained robust.  Delinquency rates for va rious types of consumer debt have moved 
down further in recent months, with some b ack to levels not seen since before the 
recession.  The number of credit card offers mailed to households edged down slightly in 
April but remained on a general upward tre nd.  That said, credit card terms are still 
somewhat tight relative to historical norms, especially for households with weaker credit 
histories, and the volume of credit card mail offerings sent to low-income consumers 
remains well below pre-crisis levels.  
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
During the intermeeting period, the Treasury Department issued about 
$300 billion of nominal coupon securities across the maturity  spectrum and $11 billion of 
TIPS; these auctions were generally well re ceived.  On May 16, Treasury debt reached its 
statutory limit, and the Treasury began to im plement so-called extraordinary measures 
that are expected to allow it to continue to finance the federal defici t into early August.  
(See the box “Debt Subject to Limit.”) 
Although concerns remain about the fi nancial health of state and local 
governments, over the intermeeting period c onditions in the m unicipal bond market 
showed modest signs of improvement.  Yiel ds on long-term general obligation bonds fell 
notably, and their ratios to yiel ds on comparable-maturity Treasury securities and to those 
on AAA-rated corporate bonds—gauges of the relative risk of municipal bonds— 
narrowed.  Issuance of municipal bonds picked  up slightly in May but remained quite 
sluggish by historical standards.

Debt Subject to Limit        
Over  the  intermeeting   period,   the  Treasury  began  using  extraordinary   accounting   measures   to  avoid  
breaching   the  $14.294  trillion   debt  limit.   As  of  June  15,  the  Board  staff  estimates   that  the  Treasury  has  
used  approximately   $45  billion  of  the  roughly  $245  billion  in  total  capacity  provided  by  the  
extraordinary   measures.   
All  forecasts   for  the  date   when  the  Treasury’s   extraordinary   measures   are  exhausted   are  uncertain,   
and  a  critical   factor  affecting   the  projections   is  the  assumed  level  of  June   tax  receipts.   As  shown  in  
the  top  figure  on  the  facing  page,  the  Board  staff  currently   estimates   that  on  August  2  the  Treasury   
will  exhaust  the  capacity  provided   by  the  extraordinary   measures.    On  August  3,  the  staff  projects  
that  the  Treasury   will  not  have  enough  cash  balances  to  meet  that   day’s  large  payments,   including   
about   $20  billion   in  Social  Security  payments.      
There  have  been  some  reports  of  major  financial  firms  beginning   to  develop   contingency   plans  in  case  
the  debt  ceiling  is  not  raised.   However,  such  efforts   are  not  widespread   or  well  coordinated   at  this  
time.    Market  participants   generally   do  not  appear  to  be  pricing  in  any  financial  market  disru ptions  in  
early  August,  apparently   because  they  have  confidence  that  the  debt  ceiling  will  be  raised  in  time  to  
avoid  any  delays  in  the  receipt  of  funds  associated   with  Treasury   debt  and  other  payments.    As  shown  
in  the  middle  and  bottom  figures  on  the  facing  page,  the  Treasury   bill  yield  curve  does  not  exhibit   
sharp  spikes  around  August  3,  and  spreads   on  five‐year  U.S.  credit  default  swaps  were  little  changed  
over  the  intermeeting   period  (although  the  illiquidity   of  this  market  makes   it  difficult  to  use  this  
information   to  draw   inferences   regarding   investor   expectations).    
Various  observers  have  noted  that  the  Treasury   has  a  few  other  options  available  for  postponing   the  
date  that  a  payment  would  be  missed.   First,  the  Treasury   Secretary   could  extend  the  Debt  Issuance  
Suspension   Period  (DISP),  which  would  free  up  some  additional   borrowing   capacity.1   However,  each  
month  that  the  DISP  is  extended   provides  only  about  $7  billion  in  additional   capacity,  so  the  Treasury  
would  need  a  lengthy  DISP  extension   to  obtain  a  sizable  amount  of  funds.   Second,  the  Treasury  
could  sell  gold.   In  this  case,  the  Treasury  would  sell  gold  at  market  prices  and  redeem  its  gold  
certificate   liabilities  held  at  the  Federal  Reserve,  valued  at  $42  per  ounce.  2   Third,  the  Treasury  could  
increase  the  pace  of  its  sales  of  mortgage ‐backed  securities   (MBS).  3  Fourth,  the  Treasury  could  
request  early  payment  of  Federal   Reserve  remittances   or  legislation   could  require  the  Federal   
1 The DISP allows the Treasury to redeem existing Treasury securities in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability 
Fund (CSRDF) up to the amount of civil service benefit payments authorized to be made during the DISP and to 
suspend new investments. Extending the DISP would provide roughly $7 billion of additional capacity for each month 
that the DISP is extended. 
2 The Treasury does have a small amount of unmonetized gold that it could sell without redeeming gold 
certificates. In principle, the Treasury might be able to raise about $387 billion in cash from gold sales. However, the 
possible adverse response of gold prices and broader financial markets to such sales would be a significant risk. 
3 There is a lag between the sales of MBS and the settlement of the cash, so accelerated sales would have to 
begin shortly to raise additional cash before August. However, the Treasury previously announced that MBS sales 
would be conducted at a gradual and orderly pace to protect the process of repair of the housing market. A rapid 
pace of sales could prompt an adverse response of MBS prices, causing strains on the functioning of financial markets.

May the strength broadened to include sma ll domestic banks.  In contrast, the ongoing 
contraction in commercial real estate loan s has continued unabated, while closed-end 
residential mortgage loans held by banks  dropped significantly, partly owing to 
substantial loan sales to the GSEs.  In addi tion, outstanding home equity loan balances 
fell in May at the fastest pace since the star t of the recession in 2007—consistent with the 
further reduction in home equity lines of credit reported in the first quarter.  On a 
somewhat positive note, the contraction in both credit card and other consumer loans held 
by banks slowed markedly over the past two months. 
On a seasonally adjusted basis, Call  Report data for bank holding com panies 
showed that industry profitability edged down in the first quarter of 2011 and remained at 
a somewhat depressed level.  A decline in pre-provision net revenue  was about offset by 
a further reduction in loan loss provisions, which likely reflected an improvement in most 
measures of the quality of banks’ assets .  Nonetheless, net charge-offs exceeded 
provisions for the fifth consecutive quarter, and loan loss reserves remained quite low 
relative to delinquent loans and charge-offs.  The regulatory capital ratios of bank holding 
companies continued to rise, with large inst itutions likely continuing to prepare for more-
stringent requirements associated with the implementation of Basel II and Basel III as 
well as the expected capital surcharge for sy stemically important institutions required by 
the Dodd–Frank Act.   
The most recent Survey of Terms of Business Lending, conducted the week of 
May 2, showed that banks had eased some terms on C&I loans.  Spreads of C&I loan 
rates over banks’ cost of funds  decreased further but remain quite elevated.  Of note, the 
weighted-average spread on C&I loans at small domestic banks—an indicator of lending 
conditions faced by small firms—fell to its lowe st level since the f ourth quarter of 2008.  
Moreover, the survey suggested that the av erage size of loan commitments at domestic 
banks and their average maturity have  trended up in recent quarters. 
M2 expanded at an annual rate of 6 pe rcent, on average, in April and May.  
Liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, continued to increase markedly, while 
small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds, whose yields remain extremely low, shrank to their lowest levels since 2005.  In the past two months, currency 
advanced significantly, likely  reflecting solid domestic demand and strengthening 
demand from abroad.  Meanwhile, the monetary  base rose considerably as the Federal

Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period              
Over  the  intermeeting   period,   total  assets  of  the  Federal  Reserve  increased   $140  billion  to  
reach  a  level  of  about  $2.8  trillion   (see  table   on  the  facing  page).   Purchases   of  Treasury  
securities   associated   with  the  Federal  Reserve’s  large  scale  asset  purchase   program  
accounted   for  the  entire  increase  in  total  assets.  
Since  the  April  FOMC  meeting,   the  Open  Market  Desk  at  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  
New  York  (FRBNY)  conducted   30  permanent  operations,   purchasing   $161  billion  in  longer‐
term  Treasury  securities.1   To  provide  flexibility   in  conducting   the  asset  purchase  
program,  late  last  year,  the  Desk  temporarily   relaxed   its  per‐issue  limit  on  System  Open  
Market  Account  (SOMA)  holdings   of  individual   Treasury   issues.   As  of  mid‐June,  SOMA  
holdings  of  15  Treasury   issues  exceed  50  percent  of  the  total  outstanding   for  each  issue,  
of  which  2  issues  have  reached  70  percent  of  the  total  outstanding   for  these  issues.   
In  other  asset  categories,  loans  outstanding   under   the  Term   Asset‐Backed   Securities   Loan  
Facility  (TALF)  fell  about  $4  billion,  reflecting   additional   prepayments   of  loans  extended

the  net  portfolio  holdings  of  Maiden  Lane   LLC  and  Maiden  Lane   III  LLC  were  little  
changed,  while  the  holdings  of  Maiden  Lane  II  LLC  declined  a  bit  reflecting   recent  sales  of  
assets.   Although  initial  auctions  of  Maiden  Lane   II  assets  went  smoothly,  the  most  recent  
auctions  have  experienced   less  attractive  bids  with  declining   prices  in  the  non‐agency  
RMBS  markets.   
On  the  liability  side  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s  balance  sheet,  Federal  Reserve  notes  in  
circulation   increased   $10  billion  over   the  period.   The  Treasury’s   general  account,  which  is  
highly  volatile  from  month  to  month,  fell  $95  billion  on  net.   The  Treasury’s   
Supplementary   Financing   Account  remained   at  the  $5  billion  level.   Reflecting   these  
factors  and  the  effects  of  the  asset  purchase  program,   reserve  balances  of  depository   
institutions   rose  $215  billion  over  the  period.   The  increase   in  reserve  balances   was  again   
concentrated   at  the  U.S.  branches   and  agencies  of  foreign  banks.    
The  Federal  Reserve  continued   its  program  of  conducting   regular  auctions  of  term  
deposits,   with   $5  billion  of  28‐day  term  deposits  auctioned   in  late  May.2   In  addition,  the  
FRBNY   conducted   a  series  of  small‐ scale,  real‐value  reverse  repurchase  transactions   that  
included  32  additional   money  market  mutual  fund  counterparties.   Overall,  the  Federal  
Reserve  now  has  110  counterparties   to  participate  in  reverse  repurchase  agreement  
operations.    The  FRBNY  also  announced   the  eligibility   criteria  for  government ‐sponsored

1 These operations include purchases in a range of maturities for nominal securities as well as 
three operations in TIPS conducted between April 28 and June 14, 2011. During this period, $157 billion in 
Treasury securities purchases settled on the balance sheet, and agency debt and MBS holdings declined 
$16 billion.

Appendix 
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Surve y on Dealer Financing Terms  
Overall, respondents to the June 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer 
Financing Terms pointed to a continued gradua l easing in credit terms with respect to major 
classes of counterparties, including hedge funds and other private pools of capital, insurance 
companies and other institutional investors, and nonfinancial firms.1  Reasons cited as most 
important across the major classes of counterparties in explaining the changes were more-aggressive competition from other institutions and an improvement in general market liquidity 
and functioning.  Most dealers also indicated th at the time and attention devoted to managing 
concentrated credit exposures to other dealers re mained basically unchanged, although a minority 
of respondents reported an increase in resources allocated to such management.  As in prior surveys, responses to questions regarding over-t he-counter (OTC) derivatives trades pointed to 
little change over the past three months in the terms for both “plain vanilla” and customized 
derivatives.  With respect to securities financ ing, respondents reported an easing of some  
financing terms for a broad spectrum of securities, including high-grade corporate bonds, equities, agency residential mortgage-bac ked securities (RMBS), and asset-backed securities 
(ABS) other than RMBS.  As in the March 2011  survey, the reported easing of terms over the 
past three months was generally evident for both average and most-favored clients but much more  
pronounced for the latter group.  Dealers also noted that demand for funding for almost all types of securities covered in the surv ey, with the exception of equities, had increased over the past 
three months.  The results of the June survey also  indicated that the volume of mark and collateral 
disputes, often viewed as a leading indicator of  market stress, remained generally unchanged 
across the entire range of counterparty and transaction types covered by the survey.  
The June survey also contained special qu estions focused on three topics:  unused 
funding capacity available to clients under existi ng agreements, the financing of less-liquid assets, 
and the current deployment of leverage relative to the pre-crisis peak and post-crisis trough.  With respect to additional funding capacity under existing agreements, large net fractions of 
respondents indicated that there was significan t unused capacity for all types of institutional 
clients and that unused capacity had generally  increased since the beginning of 2011.  With 
regard to funding of less-liquid assets, respondents generally reported an increase in such funding 
1 The June survey collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three months in 
credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.  In 
addition to the core set of questions, this survey includ ed a set of special questions about current levels and 
changes since the beginning of 2011 in clients’ unused financing capacity under the terms of existing 
agreements; a second set of special questions focused on changes over the past year in funding of less-
liquid assets by classes of counterparties and product types; and a final special question asked for respondents’ assessments of the current use of leverage by client types adopting the pre-crisis peak and post-crisis trough as reference points.  The 20 instituti ons participating in the survey account for almost all 
of the dealer financing of dollar-denominated securities to nondealers and are the most active 
intermediaries in OTC derivatives markets.  The survey was conducted during the period from May 23, 
2011, to June 3, 2011.  The core questions ask about changes between March 2011 and May 2011.

over the past year for all specified types of count erparties.  In characterizing the types of less-
liquid collateral being funded in greater amounts, high-yield corporate bonds, legacy non-agency  
RMBS, and legacy commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) were most frequently cited.  
Finally, the current use of leverage was ge nerally characterized as “roughly in the middle”— 
between the pre-crisis peak and the post-crisis trough.   
COUNTERPARTY TYPES  
Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries  
As in previous surveys, a significant majority of respondents reported that the amount of 
resources and attention devoted to management of  concentrated exposures to dealers and other 
financial intermediaries had rema ined basically unchanged over the past three months, although 
one-fourth of respondents pointed to an increas e.  More than one-half of respondents also 
characterized the volume of mark and collatera l disputes with dealers and other financial 
intermediaries as basically  unchanged over the previous three months.  A modest net fraction of  
dealers, however, pointed to a decrease.   
Hedge Funds, Private Equity Firms, a nd Other Similar Pools of Capital  
As has been true since the inaugural survey in June of last year, dealers reported, on net, 
that they had provided somewhat more-favorable credit terms over the past three months to hedge 
funds, private equity firms, and other similar pr ivate pools of capital (private pools of capital) 
across all types of transactions covered in the survey. 2  Forty percent of respondents eased 
somewhat their price terms, including, most importantly, financing rates.  A similar fraction of institutions indicated that they  had eased somewhat  their nonprice terms, which include haircuts, 
maximum  maturity, covenants, cure periods, cross-default provisions, or other documentation 
features.  As in previous surveys, the institutions  that reported an easing of terms pointed to more-
aggressive competition from other institutions, an improvement in general market liquidity and 
functioning, and, to a lesser extent, an improvement  in the current or expected financial strength 
of counterparties as the main reasons for the changes.
3  More than one-half of the respondents to  
the June survey noted an increase in the intensity  of efforts by private pools of capital to negotiate 
more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the past three months.  Looking forward over the next three months, a majority of dealers expected price and nonprice terms applicable to private 
2 For questions that ask about credit terms, reported net percentages equal the percentage of 
institutions that reported tightening terms (“tightened considerably” or “tightened somewhat”) minus the 
percentage of institutions that reported easing term s (“eased considerably” or “eased somewhat”).  For 
questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the percentage of institutions that reported increased demand (“increased considerably” or “increas ed somewhat”) minus the percentage of institutions 
that reported decreased demand (“decreased considerably” or “decreased somewhat”). 
3 An ordinal ranking of reasons for loosening or tightening is produced by adding the number of 
respondents characterizing each reason as “very impor tant” to the number char acterizing the reason as 
“somewhat important” and then sorting the sums in descending order.  For reasons with the same ranking 
based on the sums, the response that the greater number of dealers characterizes as “very important” takes 
priority.

pools of capital to remain basically unchanged,  while one-fifth of respondents, on balance, 
indicated that they anticipated further easing of terms.  
Insurance Companies, Pension Funds, and Other Institutional Investors 
The survey responses indicated that, on balance, dealers also provided more-favorable 
credit terms for insurance companies, pens ion funds, and other institutional investors 
(institutional investors) over the past three months .  About one-third of respondents indicated that 
they had eased price terms for such counterparties,  while one-fourth of dealers noted an easing of 
nonprice terms.  The most important reasons cited for the easing of credit terms were more-
aggressive competition from other institutions and an improvement in general market liquidity 
and functioning.  Increased willingness to take on ri sk was also noted as an important reason for 
the change.  Nearly one-third of dealers reported an increase in the intensity of efforts by  
institutional investors to negotiate more-favorab le price and nonprice terms over the past three 
months.  Looking forward over the next three mont hs, one-fifth of respondents, on net, expected 
credit terms applicable to institutional investors to ease somewhat further. 
Nonfinancial Corporations 
The responses to questions about credit terms applicable to nonfinancial corporations also 
pointed to some net easing over the past three months.  About one-third of respondents indicated that they had eased price terms for such count erparties; by contrast, nonprice terms were 
generally little changed.  As was the case for pr ivate pools of capital and institutional investors, 
the most important reasons cited for the easi ng were more-aggressive competition from other 
institutions and an improvement in general market  liquidity and functioning.  An improvement in 
the current or expected financial strength of co unterparties was also cited as an important reason 
for the change.  One-fourth of respondents i ndicated that there had been an increase in the 
intensity of efforts by nonfinancial corporations  to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice 
terms over the past three months.  Looking forward over the next three months, the majority  of 
dealers noted that they expected credit terms to  remain basically unchanged, although one-fourth 
of respondents, on balance, indicated that they anticipate somewhat looser terms. 
 
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES   
As has been the case since the inaugural survey in June of last year, responses to 
questions dealing with OTC derivatives trades pointed to little change over the past three months in the terms for plain vanilla and customized derivatives across different types of underlying asset classes (underlyings)—foreign exchange, interest ra tes, equities, credit, commodities, and total 
return swaps (TRS) referencing nonsecurities (such as syndicated loans).  However, a small fraction of dealers indicated that they  had eased somewhat initial margin requirements on trades 
with interest rates and credit as the underlying (for  plain vanilla derivatives).  In addition, with 
regard to TRS referencing nonsecurities as the underlyi ng, nearly one-half of the dealers active in 
this market reported having reduced somewh at initial margin requirements, and a few 
respondents also noted that they had eased some what the range of acceptable reference assets, 
maximum  maturity, and triggers and covenants.  Despite significant decline in some commodity 
Financial Developments

markets during the reference period for the survey , there was no clear evidence of an increase in  
mark or collateral disputes or of an increase in initial margin requirements.  
SECURITIES FINANCING  
As in the previous surveys, responses to qu estions focused on securities financing pointed 
to an easing of certain terms under which a broad spectrum of securities was being funded.4  The 
reported loosening of terms over the past three months was generally evident for both average  
and most-favored clients.  For average clients,  the easing of terms was most visible in the 
reduction of the financing rates applicable to funding of high-grade corporate bonds and agency 
RMBS, and in an increase in the maximum amount of funding and maximum  maturity of funding 
for ABS other than agency RMBS.  For the most-f avored clients—the focus of the remainder of 
this paragraph—the trend toward easing was more  pronounced.  With regard to terms applicable  
to the funding of high-grade corporate bonds, net fractions of survey respondents ranging 
between 25 and about 40 percen t reported an increase in the maximum amount of funding, an 
extension in the maximum  maturity, and a decline in financing rates.  With respect to terms 
applicable to the financing of equities (including through repo-like stock loan transactions), net 
fractions of dealers ranging between 15 and 20 pe rcent indicated that they had increased the 
maximum  amount of funding and extended the maximum maturity.  Regarding terms for the 
funding of agency RMBS, net portions of respondents ranging between about 20 and 35 percent noted that they had extended the maximum  matur ity, increased the maximum  amount of funding, 
reduced the financing rate, and decreased haircuts provide to most-favored clients.  With respect to terms under which ABS other than agency RMBS  are funded, net fractions of dealers ranging 
between about 25 and 50 percent reported an in crease in the maximum amount of funding, an 
extension in the maximum  maturity, a decline in  financing rates, and a decrease in haircuts. 
Survey respondents indicated that demand for funding for almost all types of securities 
considered in the survey had increased over th e past three months.  The only exception was 
equities, for which the demand for funding was reported as essentially  unchanged.  On balance, 
about one-third of dealers that lend against high-grade corporate bonds and agency RMBS reported an increase in demand for funding in the J une survey, while nearly one-half of survey  
respondents that lend against ABS other than agency RMBS indicated that demand for funding such securities had increased.  Small net fractions of respondents reported an increase in the amount of “vendor” financing—that is, the fundi ng on preferential terms of securities that the 
financing dealer has played a role in bringing to market—provided for high-grade corporate 
bonds, agency RMBS, and ABS other than agency RMBS.  
Respondents indicated that liquidity and functioning of several markets had improved 
over the past three months.
5  One-half of dealers pointed to an improvement in liquidity and 
4 In this survey, securities financing includes lending to clients collateralized by high-grade 
corporate bonds, equities, agency RMBS, and other ABS. 
5 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repurchase agreements and similar secured 
financing transactions, not changes in the funding market itself.

functioning in the high-grade corporate bond ma rket, and 40 percent of respondents noted an 
improvement in the market for ABS other than agency RMBS.  About 20 percent of dealers 
reported an improvement in the agency  RMBS market.  
As in the March 2011 survey, respondents generally reported that the volume of collateral 
and m
ark disputes with clients related to the fu nding of collateral of all types had remained 
unchanged.   
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING CAPACITY UNDER TERMS OF 
EXISTING AGREEMENTS   
Some counterparties reportedly maintain signi ficant unused financing capacity  under the 
terms of existing agreements, allowing them, for example, to fund additional assets or withdraw 
excess collateral left at the dealer.  Thus, the leve rage used by these counterparties is constrained 
not by the availability of additional funding but by their risk appetite and investment objectives. 
A set of special questions sought informati on regarding the amount of additional capacity  
currently available to different classes of counter parties as well as changes in this capacity since 
the beginning of 2011.  Overall, large net fractions of respondents indicated that there was some degree of unused capacity for all types of clients listed in the survey.
6  Of note, substantial 
capacity was reported by  nearly 40 percent of d ealers with respect to most-favored hedge funds, 
and by about 30 percent of dealers with respect to other hedge funds, asset managers (representing holders of separately managed account s), and mutual funds and pension funds.  
Respondents indicated that the unused funding capacity available to several types of clients had increased since the beginning of 2011.  In particular, one-half of dealers reported an increase in unused funding capacity for most-favored hedge funds, while nearly one-half noted such an 
increase for trading real estate investment trusts (REITs).
7  In addition, about 30 percent of 
respondents pointed to an increase in such funding capacity for other hedge funds.  More-modest net fractions of dealers indicated an increase in unused funding capacity over the same period for 
asset managers and insurance companies.  
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON FUNDING OF LESS-LIQUID ASSETS  
The gradual increase in leverage evident over the past year appears to have been driven 
by incremental funding of relatively liquid assets.  But, reportedly, there has also been some 
limited increase in the funding of less-liquid asset types using various mechanisms, including securities financing trades, prime brokerage accounts, and TRS that replicate the economics of  
collateralized lending.  Another set of special questions sought information about changes in the amount of funding of less-liquid assets by different types of counterparties over the past year and 
in the types of less-liquid assets being funded.  Overall, respondents reported an increase over the 
6 This question was posed with respect to eight types of counterparties:  most-favored hedge 
funds; other hedge funds; private equity firms; trading real estate investment trusts (REITs); asset 
managers; mutual funds and pension plans; insurance companies; and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), unit 
investment trusts (UITs), special purpose vehicles (SPVs), and similar entities. 
7 Trading REITs invest in assets backed by real estate, rather than directly in real estate.

past year by all specified classes of  counterparties listed in the survey.8  In particular, nearly  
three-fourths of respondents reported an increase for most-favored hedge funds, while around 
one-half of dealers noted an increase for other he dge funds, trading REITs, and private equity  
firms.  When asked about the types of less-liquid collateral being funded, net fractions of respondents ranging between about 50  and 80 percent pointed to an increase in funding for legacy  
CMBS, legacy RMBS, and high-yield corporate bonds over the past year.  A smaller number of respondents, about 40 percent, on net, also cited an increase in the funding of legacy  
collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs. 
SPECIAL QUESTION ON  OVERALL USE OF LEVERAGE  
The use of financial leverage has reportedl y increased modestly since it approached its 
apparent nadir in wake of the financial crisis.  One final special question asked about the current use of leverage by specific types of counterparti es relative to both the post-crisis trough in late 
2009 and pre-crisis peak in late 2006.  Responde nts were asked to assess leverage using a seven-
point scale, with responses ranging from “at or belo w the trough level” to “at or above the peak 
level.”  Overall, a large majority of respondent s reported that leverage was roughly in the middle 
of the range between the peak and trough levels  for all types of counterparties listed in the 
survey.
9  With regard to insurance companies, howev er, one-third of dealers noted that leverage 
was only moderately above the trough level.   
8 The question was posed with respect to the same  eight types of counterparties as was the prior 
question on unused funding capacity. 
9 Again, the question was posed with respect to the same eight types of counterparties as were the 
prior questions on unused funding capacity and financing of less-liquid assets.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY    
We continue to see the risks around our projection for economic  activity  as  
elevated relative to the average experience of the past 20  years  (the benchmark used by  
the Committee).   Because the financial crisis and the subsequent recession were both 
large and historically unusual, the relative influences of supply  and demand in generating  
the contraction are difficult to gauge, implying  elevated  uncertainty with regard to the  
level of slack  and  to the  timing and  strength of the recovery.  In particular, the  restraint 
being imposed by the impaired balance sheets of  households and financial  institutions  is  
hard to judge, as is the pace at which those balance sheets will be repaired.  In addition, it  
is difficult  to discern with confidence how much of the recent slowdown in activity  stems 
from  factors that likely will have little or no influence  on the long-run level of U.S. 
economic activity (such as the supply disruptions  associated with the earthquake in 
Japan) , from  factors that likely have had a more lasting  effect on the level of activity  
(such as higher  energy prices) , and from  forces that may have more -persistent effects on 
the growth rate of activity  going forward.  
We now judge the  risks to our proj ection for  real  activity as skewed to the 
downside.  Although we  have made  a sizable downward adjustment to our  projection of  
real GDP  growth in the  medium term in this Tealbook, the breadth of the  weakness in the  
recent data leaves us concerned that the contractionary  forces  that have weighed on the 
economy over the p ast several  years  may prove to be more persistent than we assumed or 
might even intensify .  In addition, we see downside tail risks emanating from sovereign 
debt concerns in Europe, from the  chance  that the Congress fails  to  enact a timely  
increase in the debt limit, and from the possibility  that financial market participants may  
become increasingly concerned that U.S. fiscal policy will remain on  an unsustainable 
path. 
We also see the risks ar ound our  baseline projection for inflation as elevated  
relative to the experience of the past 20  years , in part because the prospects  for inflation 
expectations  appear unusually  uncertain .  On the one hand, very  low levels  of resource 
utilization, meager  gains  in labor costs, and more- pessimistic views on the economic  
outlook could result in some downshift in inflation expect ations.  On the other hand, 
Risks & Uncertainty   
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

renewed increases in commodity prices, a more-pronounced weakening in the exchange 
value of the dollar, and concerns about undisciplined fiscal policy could cause inflation 
expectations to move up at some point.  In addition, the federal funds rate is near zero 
and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is historically large.   Moreover, the difficulties  
associated with gauging e  conomic slack in the wake of an unusually deep recession 
imply large  risks —in both directions—to our assessment of the role that slack will play in  
influe ncing inflation going forward.  Weighing these risk s to both the upside and 
downside, we continue to see the risks around our  inflation projection as roughly  
balanced.   (See the box “Uncertainty about the Macroeconomic Outlook” for a discussion 
of some empirical measures of uncertainty.)  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS   
To illustrate some of the  risks to the outlook, we consider several alternatives to 
the baseline projection using simulations of staff  models.  We begin with a simulation in  
which the NAIRU increases as the labor market remains distressed, lowering  the level of  
potential output  relativ e to  the baseline projection, and thereby setting the stage for higher  
inflation and weaker activity.  We next  consider the possibility that we have taken too 
much signal from the  weak recent data  and have  underestimated the underlying strength  
of the recovery  that is currently under  way.  The third scenario considers the opposite  
risk—that we have taken too little signal from the  recent softness in the spending  
indicators and that the recovery will be even more sluggish than we expect .  The fourth 
scenario  builds on this weakness by further  assuming that, in an environment in which 
the unemployment rate remains persistently  elevated, inflation will move down 
noticeably.  The fifth scenario assumes that a credible budget plan is enacted that  halts  
the rise i n the ratio of the debt  to  GDP  and then puts it on a downward trajectory  back  
toward its  current level.  The final two scenarios consider risks  arising from sovereign  
debt problems in Europe, including one that imbeds  financial spillover effects to  the 
United States and our major non-European trading partners .  We generate the first five 
scenarios using the  FRB/US model and an estimated policy  rule.  The last two scenarios  
are  generated using the  multicountry SIGMA model, which uses a different policy rule  
for the federal funds rate that employs an  alternative concept of resource utilization.1   
1 In the FRB/US simulations, the federal funds rate follows the outcome -based rule described in 
the appendix on policy rules in Book B.  In the case of SIGMA, its rule is broadly similar but responds to 
slack as gauged by the difference between actual output and the model ’s estimate of the level that would 
occur in the absence of a slow adjustment in wages and prices.

available only for a very recent sample period. 
Risks & Uncertainty

June 15, 2011A variety of indicators , both survey -based and statistical, suggest that 
uncertainty about the outlook for real activity and inflation —although generally 
down from the very high levels that prevailed during the recession —remains 
somewhat above the typical level of uncertainty experienced over the past two 
decades.  
Survey -based measures provide one indication that uncertainty remains elevated.  
For example, responses to the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) can be 
used to examin e the degree to which private forecasters disagree about the 
outlook for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  Although 
such disagreement is conceptually distinct from uncertainty, it seems likely that 
wider disagreement is correlated with greater uncertainty, in part because 
opinions about the correct interpretation of incoming data are likely to be more 
diverse than normal when the economy has been hit by unusual disturbances . 
Currently, disagreement among SPF participants , as measured by the 
interquartile range of their forecasts , is elevated relative to the average of the 
past 20 years for both the unemployment rate and CPI inflation (as shown in the 
lower- left figure).1 
A more statistical approach to assessing uncertainty uses time- series models that 
allow for shifts in the volatility of shocks to activity, inflation, and other factors.  
One such approach assumes that the shocks to a simple regression model 
Page 76 of 102

explaining either real activity or inflation have a standard  deviation  that varies  
over time; movements in  these estimated standard deviations provide a simple 
metric  of changes in uncertainty about the economic  outlook .2   Results  from  
such an exercise for the  unemployment  rate  and PCE  inflation  are reported in  the 
lower- right  figure  on the  facing  page .  These estimates indicate that  uncertainty  
about  the  unemployment  rate increased  sharp ly  at the onset of  the recession ; 
this uncertainty  has since moderated  but  remains  somewhat  elevated  relative to 
historical norms.  The results also indicate a sharp  increase over the last few  years  
in uncertainty  about  the inflation outlook:  Although  the  estimated standard  
deviation  of  shocks to headline PCE inflation  is  down from  its  peak last  year, it  
remain s  near the h  igh end  of  the range observed  since the late 1980s.   
Another set of indicators  can be  derived from  prices in  options markets.  As  
shown in  the figure below, t he S&P  implied  volatility index ( VIX)  and the 
analogous  measure for oil prices, which we call the “ oil VIX ,”  have both fallen  
substantially  from their crisis  peaks  and  are currently  at  relatively  low  levels.  
Although  these readings  could be consistent with low  macroeconomic  
uncertainty, the evidence is only suggestive.  For one, the VIX and oil VIX  pertain  
to variables  related  to  real activity and consumer prices but do not pertain  to real 
activity and consumer prices themselves.  For another, movements in variables  
like the VIX and oil VIX reflect  the price of risk  as well  as the level of risk.   
All told, these indicators  present a diverse picture, but  on balance we view them  
as continuing  to suggest somewhat elevated uncertainty regarding  the outlook  
for both  real activity and inflation.   
2 The particular approach used here assumes that the unemployment rate and headline 
PCE price inflation follow an autoregressi ve process and that the standard deviation of the 
errors follows a T -GARCH (threshold generalized autoregressive conditional 
heteroskedasticity) process. S&P VIX and Oil VIX

Labor Market Damage  
The unusual depth and breadth of the downturn and the prolonged state of high 
unemployment  may  have impaired labor- market efficiency  and boosted t he NAIRU by 
more than assumed in the baseline projection, perhaps  by  creating the need  for unusually  
large and  costly intersectoral  reallocations of productive resources or through the  adverse  
effects of prolonged unemployment on individuals’ reemployment possibilities .  In  this  
scenario , we assume that  the NAIRU is 6¾ percent currently, ¾ percentage  point above  
baseline; although it declines gradually after 2012, it remains above baseline by that  
amount.  I n addition, persistently  poor labor market prospec ts could lead to weaker  
attachment s to the labor  force and hence to lower  potential employment through a lower  
trend labor force participation rate.  We thus also assume that  trend labor force 
participation  declines  more rapidly than the staff estimates, s o that  labor force 
participation  is 0.6 percentage point  below baseline by the end of 2015.  With the lower  
levels of potential labor input, output, and income, and their  attendant  effects on  
consumption and investment, real GDP and employment expand le ss rapidly  than in the  
baseline, causing  the unemployment rate  to fall more slowly  and to reach  only 6¼ percent  
by late 2015.  Nevertheless, because of the higher  NAIRU, there is less slack  in labor  
markets , leading to  cost pressures that are  greater  than in the baseline, with the result that 
core PCE prices increase about ¼ percentage point  a year  faster than in the baseline over  
the next few  years .  Over time, as  policymakers take on board the  evidence of   
less-favorable supply-side conditions, monetary poli cy tightens a bit faster  than in the  
baseline.  
Stronger Recovery  
In the baseline, we have interpreted  the disappointing news on spending and the  
labor market  as signaling that the  economic recovery  will be persistently  more sluggish 
than we had previously  envisioned.  In this scenario, the disappointing news  instead  
reflect s, to a greater degree than in the baseline, the effects of  transitory factors  that are 
masking the emergence of a more robust recovery .  As a result,  real GDP rises at an  
annual rate  of about 4 percent in the second half of this  year and 4½ percent in 2012, 
boosting the demand for  labor enough to push the  unemployment rate down to about  
7½ percent by late next  year.   Initially, the stronger pace of the recovery has little effect  
on inflation because higher investment increases labor productivity and therefore holds  
down unit labor costs and because long-run inflation expectations are well  anchored.  In 
time, however, tighter labor and product markets  cause inflation to move up more than in

the baseline.   Largely i n response to stronger real activity, the federal  funds  rate lifts off  
from  its effective lower bound at the end of  this year.  
Weaker Recovery  
As a mirror image of the  previous scenario, this scenario considers the possibility  
that we did not react enough to the recent incoming data, and that  balance sheet  
difficulties and other  factors  will  weigh  more heavily  on household and business  
spending, and hence overall production and hiring , for longer  than assumed in the  
baseline.  Consistent with these developments, c orporate equity prices fall  rather than  
rise, reflecting  both poorer earnings prospects and higher  risk premiums , with the result 
that stock market wealth is about 1 5 percent below baseline by late next  year.  Under  
these co nditions, households limit  their spending b  y enough to boost  the personal saving  
rate cl ose to 6  percent  by the end of 2012, about ¾ percentage point higher than in the  
baseline.  In addition, business investment is about 7 percent  below baseline by late next  
year.   As  a result, real GDP  expands only 2¾ percent  on average in 2012 and 2013, 
causing the improvement in labor market conditions to be even  slower so that  the 
unemployment  rate is still at 8¼ percent by the  end of 2013.  With  such an anemic 
recover y,  core inflation gradually moves down to about 1 percent  by 2015, and t he 
federal funds rate stays near zero  until mid -2014. 
Weaker Recovery with Further Disinflation  
In the previous scenario, despite persistent economic slack, core inflation declines  
only modestly relative  to baseline  because long -run inflation expectations  are assumed to  
remain well  anchored .  But the relative stability of various measures of expected inflation 
over the past several  years may be misleading us  about the potential for furt her  
disinflation,  particularly if the unemployment rate remain s  elevated.   In this scenar io, 
inflation expectations become unanchored and c ore inflation falls  below ½  percent by  
mid-decade.  Outcomes for real GDP and unemployment are similar to those in th e 
preceding scenario, largely because long -term nominal interest rates decline with actual 
and expected inflation, implying little effective  change in financial conditions.  In 
response to continued disinflation and high unemployment, the federal funds rat e remains  
near zero until the  end of 2014.

Fiscal Consolidation  
Although the baseline incorporates more fiscal restraint beyond 2012 than would 
be implied by a  “current  policy”  assumption, federal debt  nonetheless rises  from about  
65 percent  of GDP  this  year  to 75 percent by 2015 and to around 80 percent at the end of  
the decade.   In this scenario, however, the Congress and the Administration agree  this  
summer  on a  credible budget plan that  gradually raises  taxes and cut s government  
spending by  enough to bring the budget deficit down from about 7 percent  of GDP in 
2012 to less than 3  percent by 2015 and somewhat further thereafter.  Such a pace of  
deficit reduction  would be broadly consistent with  the proposal from the National  
Commission  on Fiscal Responsibility  and Reform  that aims  first to halt the rise in  the 
debt- to-GDP ratio  and then  to bring it back down to near  its current level a decade from  
now.  In this scenario, the public is  assumed to understand fully and promptly  the 
economic implications of  the new fiscal policy  and to respond accordingly.  As a result, 
long- term interest rates fall about 30 basis points  this summer  in anticipation of lower  
short- term interest rates  later in the decade  as fiscal restraint builds.  These and other  
financial  market effects cushion the decline in real activity that would otherwise  occur ; as  
a result, unemployment is only a  little higher  and inflation a little lower .  Under these 
conditions, monetary policy tightens more slowly  and the federal funds  rate is about   
50 basis points below baseline in 2015. 
Mild Recession in Europe  
In the baseline forecast,  we project that European economies will expand at a 
modest pace while financial stresses remain largely  confined to the euro -area periphery.     
In this scenario, we  assume those financial stresses intensify, perhaps  reflecting  concerns  
about how debt problems in Greece and other peripheral countries will be resolved, and 
spillovers push Europe into a mild recession by the second half of this  year.  Specifically, 
a heightening of investor  concerns not only elevates many European sovereign spreads  
but also leads to a 200 basis point rise in European corporate bond spreads, a tightening  
of consumer credit, and weakened confidence.  Consequently , European real GDP  
declines about 2½ percent relative to baseline by the second half of 2012, 
notwithstanding a real depreciation of the European currencies of  about 10 percent  
against the dollar.  The stronger dollar  and weaker foreign activity cause U.S. real net  
exports to fall relative to baseline, but the overall effects of the recession in Europe for  
the United States are limited in the absence of significant spillovers to U.S. financial 
markets.  All told, U.S. real GDP rises about 3¼ percent in 2012, only a ¼ percentage

point lower than in the baseline.  Lower import prices and greater  resource  slack push 
down core PCE inflation to 1¼ percent in 2012, and the federal funds rate remains near  
zero until early 2013.  
Severe Recession in Europe  
In this scenario, we assume a much l arger rise in European sovereign and private  
spreads  than in the previous scenario—perhaps triggered by a disorderly default on Greek 
debt—and a much larger  decline in the European currencies .  Specifically, European 
corporate spreads rise about 400 basis points relative to baseline in the second half of this  
year, and the euro plummets more than 30 percent against the dollar.  With  domestic  
demand contracting sharply, European GDP falls  more than  5 percent relative to baseline 
by the  end of next  year.  Moreover, the problems in Europe are assumed to have  
pronounced spillover effects on financial markets  throughout the world, including in the  
United States.  U.S. net exports are depressed by  weaker foreign activity  and the stronger  
dollar, which is buoyed by  flight -to-safety flows.   Domestic demand is restrained by  
rising U.S. corporate bond yields , declining stock prices , and falling  confidence.   
Altogether, U.S. real GDP growth dips below 2 percent in 2012, and the unemployment  
rate remains near  9 percent next  year.  The greater resource slack,  coupled  with lower  
import prices, pushes down core PCE inflation to around ½ percent  in 2012.  The federal  
funds rate remains near zero until the end of 2013.2  
OUTSIDE FORECASTS   
In its June survey, the  Blue Chip conse nsus forecast for this  year’s increase in real  
GDP  revised down 0.4 percentage point compared with the  April release that was  
available at the time of the  previous Tealbook.  The consensus  forecast  is now at   
2.8 percent,  essentially the same as  the staff projection.  The consensus projection 
anticipates a 3.1 percent rise in real GDP  in 2012, about ½ percentage point below the  
staff projection.  Nonetheless, t he Blue Chip forecast for the unemployment rate at the 
end of 2012 is 8.0 percent,  a touch lower than  the  staff’s projection.  Regarding inflation, 
the Blue Chip anticipates that the overall CPI  will  increas e 3.4 percent over the four  
2 The liftoff of the federal funds rate is several quarters earlier in this scenario than in the “Weaker 
Recovery” scenar ios, notwithstanding that both output growth and inflation fall more sharply in the former. 
This difference arises because the funds rate paths in the two European recession scenarios are generated 
using SIGMA’s policy rule, which differs from the rule us ed in the FRB/US model.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
