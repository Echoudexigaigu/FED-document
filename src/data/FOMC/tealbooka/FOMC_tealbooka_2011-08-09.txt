Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information on economic activity that  we have received since the June 
Tealbook has been notably weak er than we had expected, extending a string of several 
months of disappointing economic news.  Real  GDP is now estimated to have increased 
at an average annual rate of onl y 1 percent in the first half of  this year, compared with our 
estimate of 2 percent in the previous projection.  Consumer spending outside of motor 
vehicles has been quite sluggish in recen t months, consumer confidence has slumped 
again, indicators of business sentiment and production have softened noticeably, and the 
housing market remains depressed.  Moreover, the labor market appears to be in worse 
shape than earlier in the y ear, with employment growth stepping down sharply in May 
and June and the unemployment rate edging up. 
The specific identity of the forces imposing greater-than-expected restraint on the 
expansion is not readily appare nt.  One possibility is that the shocks that have hit the 
economy are more severe and more persistent  in their effects on aggregate demand than 
we previously recognized.  A nother possibility is that th e self-equilibrating tendency of 
the economy has been greatly weakened by the damage resulting from the financial crisis.  
A third possibility is that the economic wea kness reflects structural  factors—and a lower 
path of potential GDP—to a gr eater degree than we had b een assuming.  We have, in 
fact, put greater weight on all of these possi bilities and have adjusted the forecast 
accordingly.  Thus, while we continue to anticipate that a rebound in motor vehicle production will produce a noticeab le acceleration in the near term, we have marked down 
our forecast for the growth of real GDP over th e second half of the year to 2¾ percent at 
an annual rate, about ¾ percentage point w eaker than we anticipated in the June 
Tealbook, and for 2012,  we now project real GDP  to increase 3 perc ent, ½ percentage 
point less than in the June Tealbook.  On th e supply side of the projection, we have 
interpreted the BEA’s downward revisions to  real GDP over the past three years as 
implying a slower growth rate of potentia l GDP, both during those years and in 2011 and 
2012.  (The appendix at the end of this section provides a summary of the annual 
revisions to the NIPA.)  With output grow th revised down both this year and next by 
more than our adjustment to potential grow th, the unemployment rate is projected to 
decline even more gradually than in the June Tealbook, rema ining close to 9¼ percent for 
the remainder of this year before falling to 8½ percent—about ½ percentage point above 
the June projection—by the end of 2012.

The incoming data on consumer price inflat ion have been above our expectations 
on balance.  We continue to think that much  of the recent acceleration in core consumer 
prices reflects transitory fact ors.  But we have also propagated forward to some extent the 
surprises of the past few months, putting so me upward pressure on our core inflation 
projection over the second half of  this year and early next year.  Going the other way, the 
larger margin of resource slack in this forecast is expected to exert slightly greater 
downward pressure on inflation over the medium term than in the June Tealbook.  In all, 
we revised up our projection of total PCE inflation slightly to 2½ pe rcent this year but 
left it unrevised in 2012 at 1½ percent.  Th e projected step-down in total PCE price 
inflation next year reflects an expected decel eration in energy and food prices as well as a 
lower rate of core inflation, as the pass-through from the earlier run-ups in commodity 
and import prices wanes. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
In light of the appreciably weaker ou tlook for real GDP and the little-changed 
projection for inflation this round, we now a ssume that the FOMC will hold the target 
federal funds rate in the curre nt range of 0 to ¼ percent until the third quarter of 2013, 
three quarters later than we assumed in June.  Regarding nonconventional monetary 
policy, our forecast is conditioned on the a ssumption that the FOMC will not undertake 
any further expansion of its portfolio and that it will continue to reinvest principal 
payments from its securities holdings until the first quarter of 2013—also three quarters 
later than we assumed in the previous round.  In the first quarter of  2013, we assume that 
the FOMC will begin allowing principal paymen ts to reduce its securities holdings, and 
we expect the Federal Reserve to begin selling assets in early 2014. 
Financial Conditions   
Earlier this week, legislation was enacted that raised the statutory debt limit and 
restrains expected budget defic its by a total of about $2¼ tri llion over the next decade.  
While those actions are sufficient to avoid a default by the Treasury, the magnitude of the 
deficit reduction over the longer term may well be insufficient to prevent a one-notch downgrade to Treasury debt by one or more of  the major credit rating agencies in the 
months ahead.

We think a downgrade would not come as a surprise to market participants in 
light of the extensive news c overage given to the issue, as well as the well-publicized 
pronouncements by the credit rating agencies.  Thus, while specula tion about the timing 
or specific elements of a credit rating dow ngrade could spark a period of heightened 
volatility across U.S. financial markets, we have assumed that, over the medium term, a 
downgrade will not leave a lasting imprint on in termediate-term Treasury yields or risk 
spreads on investment-grade cor porate bonds or mortgage rates re lative to what is already 
priced into the market.  That said, while such a relatively benign outcome seems most  
likely to us at this point, we  cannot rule out the tail risk that even a one-notch downgrade 
of Treasury debt could end up destabilizing financial markets,  resulting in much higher 
interest rates and much lower stock prices , with significant adverse effects on economic  
activity.   
Since the time of the June Tealbook, the yield on 10-year T reasury securities has 
decreased 45 basis points, on net, as market  participants—like the staff—shifted their 
expectations down significantly for the federal funds rate over the medium term.  As a 
result, we lowered the projected trajectory for the 10-year Treasury yield noticeably this 
round.  As in June, we expect this yield to ri se markedly over the next year and a half; 
this expectation reflects the movement of the valuation window through the period of 
near-zero short-term interest rates, as well as  an increase in the term premium associated 
with the gradual normalization of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and with some investors gradually shifting their portfolios aw ay from the safest assets as the economic 
recovery gains a firmer footing over time. 
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  have decreased about in line with 
Treasury yields since the June Tealbook, l eaving their implied risk spreads about 
unchanged at a level that remains somewhat el evated by historical standards.  With the 
pace of economic growth picking up over the medium term, we expect the spread for investment-grade bond yields to decrease a litt le through the end of next year, so that 
yields on these bonds rise only slightly le ss than Treasury yields .  Since mid-June, 
interest rates on conforming fi xed-rate mortgages have stay ed close to 4½ percent and 
their spreads to intermediate-term Treasury yields have moved up some.  In June, we 
expected mortgage spreads to increase in coming months, but they came up sooner than 
we had anticipated.  Looking ahead, we see conforming mortgage ra tes rising to just 
under 5½ percent by the end of 2012, somewhat less than what was projected in the 
previous round.

The Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market  Index has decreased about 2 percent 
since the June Tealbook, including a fairly sharp recent decline amid some weaker-than-
expected economic data and heightened concerns about global growth.  Although we 
have marked down the projected level of stock prices this round, we expect them to rise 
at an average annual rate close to 9 percen t through the end of 2012.  That pace of stock 
price appreciation should bri ng the equity premium down gr adually toward longer-run 
norms. 
The latest data from CoreLogic showed existing home prices falling through June 
at about the pace we had
 anticip ated in the June Tealbook.  We continue to expect prices 
to decrease about 4 percent this year and to edge down a bit further in 2012. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are unch anged in this projection.  The June 
Tealbook already incorporated an assumption that the Congress would enact legislation 
sufficient to reduce federal deficits by a total of about $2¼ trillion over the next 
10 years—an outcome that is in line with th e recent budget legislati on.  We continue to 
expect federal fiscal policy actions to be a roughly neutral influence on aggregate demand 
in 2011.  In 2012, federal fiscal actions are expe cted to impose a drag of about 1 percent 
of GDP as the payroll tax cuts lapse, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation 
program is phased out, the stimulus grants for states and localities are essentially 
exhausted, real federal purchases decline,  and the expensing provision for business 
investment is scaled back. 
Our projections for the federal deficit ar e essentially unchanged since the June 
Tealbook.  The deficit is projected to narro w from $1.3 trillion (about 8½ percent of 
GDP) in fiscal year 2011 to $1.1 trillion in  fiscal 2012 (around 7 percent of GDP), 
primarily reflecting the further waning of s timulus-related policies.  Federal debt is 
projected to rise to more than 70 percen t of GDP by the end of fiscal 2012, up from  
36 percent at the end of fiscal 2007 at the start of the financial crisis.  
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
We estimate that foreign real GDP growth  slowed from 4¼ percent in the first 
quarter to 2¼ percent in the second, held dow n by the direct and spillover effects of the 
earthquake in Japan, ongoing financial stre sses in Europe, and a downshift in many

economies toward more sustainable growth ra tes.  Although the deceleration in foreign 
economic activity was somewhat more pronounc ed than we expected in June, we 
anticipate that a bounceback in Japan’s economy,  together with a pickup in U.S. growth, 
will boost foreign real GDP growth to about 3½ percent in the second half of this year 
and next.  The projected pace of growth this year and next is nearly ¼ percentage point 
slower than in the June Tealbook, main ly reflecting the weaker U.S. outlook. 
The starting point of our pr ojected path for the broad real dollar is nearly 
1 percen
t lower than we anticipat ed in the June forecast.  From  this slightly lower level, 
the dollar is assumed to deprec iate at an annual rate of a bout 2¾ percent over the forecast 
period, a pace similar to what we wrote down in June.  Most of the dollar’s projected 
decline occurs against th e currencies of the emerging market economies.   
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
The spot price of West Texas Intermedia te (WTI) crude oil closed on August 2 at 
$94 per barrel, $3.50 lower than the closing price in the previous forecast.1  We project 
that the spot price of WTI will edge up to almost $100 per barrel by the end of 2012.  
Compared with the June Teal book projection, that path is about $3.50 lower in the second 
half of this year and about $2 lower by the e nd of next year.  In c ontrast, we revised up 
our projection for the price of imported oil by an average of almost $6 per barrel.  The 
spread of the price of importe d oil over the price of WTI wa s much wider in May than we 
anticipated in the June Tealbook, and recent i ndicators suggest that the wider spread 
persisted in June.  We carried some of  this widening forward in our forecast. 
Prices for nonfuel commodities have change d little in the aggregate over the past 
six weeks despite large movements in the prices of individual commodities.  For 
example, cotton prices have declined 30 percent since the June  Tealbook and are now 
only about half of the peak value reached in March.  Although U.S. growing conditions 
have been unfavorable for cotton, global co tton production is projec ted to be strong.  
1 Starting with this forecast, we have adopted a new methodology for projecting the prices of oil 
and other commodities (see the box “Forecasting Commodity Prices” in the June Tealbook for details). 
Whereas previously we had based our forecasts directly on quotes from futures markets, we now adjust futures prices in light of the divergences between pr ivate and staff forecasts fo r global economic growth 
and exchange rates, with the assumption that privat e forecasters believe that  exchange rates follow a 
random walk.  The adjusted fo recast for crude oil prices is slightly lower than the forecast based solely on 
the futures markets, largely reflecting the fact that th e staff’s projection for economic growth is lower than 
that reported in the Consensus Forecasts , our proxy for the market expectation of global growth.

Metals prices, in contrast, have moved up si nce mid-June.  Although recent disruptions to 
copper production may account for some of this run-up, the increase in metals prices has 
been broad based, suggesting an important ro le for demand.  Given quotes from futures 
markets, combined with our adjustments for divergences between staff and private 
economic forecasts, we project that nonfuel commodity prices will remain near their 
current elevated levels over the forecast period.  
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have marked down our near-term proj ection of economic activity yet again.  
Much of the downward revision reflects a re duction in our forecast of consumer spending 
in response to weaker-than-expected recent r eadings on spending itself, as well as real 
incomes, employment, and sentiment.  But we have also marked down our expectation 
for the increase in business spending over th e second half of this year.  We have not 
materially changed our estimates of the eff ects of the Japan disaster on U.S. real GDP 
since the June Tealbook, and we continue to expect that most  of the Japan-related hit to 
second-quarter production will be unwound this qua rter.  As a result, we currently project 
real GDP growth to step up to an annual ra te of 3 percent this quarter.  Excluding the 
effects of the Japan disaster, we estimate that real GDP would have increased roughly 2 percent in both the second and third quarters, about ¾ percentage point lower, on average, than we expected in June.  Of c ourse, the labor market report that we will 
receive at the end of the w eek will play an important role in shaping our near-term  
outlook. 
The Industrial Sector 
Manufacturing production decelerated from  a 7¼ percent rate of increase in the 
first quarter to a gain of only ¼ percent in the second.  Altho ugh the slowdown mainly 
reflected the effects of the Japan disaster  on the motor vehicle producers and the firms 
that supply them, the pace of manufacturi ng activity also slowed appreciably among 
industries that were unlikely to have been affect ed by supply chain disruptions.  
Moreover, indicators of near -term manufacturing activity—suc h as diffusion indexes of 
new orders from the manufacturing ISM survey and the various regional manufacturing 
surveys—have softened considerably in rece nt months to levels consistent with only 
meager gains in production in coming months.  Manufacturing IP is expected to increase 
at an annual rate of 4¾ percent in the second half of this y ear, supported in large part by 
the scheduled rebound in motor vehicle assemblies and the a ssociated boost to production

in upstream industries.  (See the box “The Near-Term Outlook for Light Motor Vehicle 
Production” for further discussi on.)  Outside of motor vehicl es and related industries, 
production is expected to post only sluggi sh gains during the next few months. 
The Labor Market  
Labor demand appears to have slowed noticeably in recent months.  After 
increasing an average of 200,000 in the first four months of the year, private nonfarm  
payroll employment rose only 73,000 in Ma y and 57,000 in June.  The step-down in 
private employment gains was widespread acro ss industries.  In addition, employment in 
the state and local government sector fe ll 35,000 on average in May and June, as 
governments continued to trim payrolls in response to budget pressures.  Meanwhile, 
initial claims for unemployment insurance ha ve come down in recent weeks but remain 
elevated, while the latest indicators of hiri ng show no signs of improvement.  Taking into 
account these signals from within the labor market as well as the evidence of weaker 
economic activity more generally, we now expect private employment to increase about 130,000 per month during the sec ond half of the year, a bout 80,000 less than we had 
written down in the June Tealbook.  The unemployment rate edged up further in June to 
9.2 percent; with labor demand pr ojected to increase only mode stly in the near term, we 
expect the unemployment rate to stay near this level through the end of the year.   
Household Spending 
After having increased at an annual rate of  about 2 percent in th e first quarter, real 
PCE was nearly unchanged last quarter and looks to be rising  at a significantly slower 
pace in the current quarter than we expected  in the June Tealbook.  Much of the second-
quarter deceleration in consumer spending refl ected a drop in outlays for motor vehicles 
that we expect to be largely re versed this quarter as the availability of models affected by 
supply chain disruptions improves.  Spendi ng on other goods and services, however, has 
also been quite soft in recent months.  In addition, the latest re adings on sentiment, 
income, and employment have been more downbeat than we were expecting.  In 
particular, the Michigan index of consumer sentiment dropped sharply in July to levels 
last seen in early 2009, while the disappointing data on the labor market led us to mark 
down our forecast of real disposable income in the second half of this year.  All told, we  
now project that real PCE will rise at an annual rate of about 1¾ percent over the second 
half, ¾ percentage point less than our projection in the June Tealbook.

The Near-Term Outlook for Light Motor Vehicle Production
A significant portion of the acceleration in real GDP in the third quarter projected by the Board staff can 
be traced to an expected sizable increase in motor vehicle assemblies. As the supply chain disruptions 
resulting from the earthquake in Japan that restrained production in the second quarter continue to 
fade, U.S. automakers plan to step up their assembly rates to replenish their current extremely low 
level of dealer inventories. Indeed, given the tight level of inventories at present, we believe that 
automakers’ near-term production goals would not be affected even if vehicle sales failed to increase 
this quarter.
Although the planned increase in vehicle assemblies is historically large, three factors suggest that the 
anticipated increase in third-quarter production is attainable. First, while the projected pace of 
production for the third quarter stands 1 1/2  million units above second-quarter production, it would 
exceed the pre-earthquake pace by only about 1 /2  million units. As shown by the red circle in the lower- 
left figure, production of Japanese nameplate vehicles is scheduled to rise only a bit above pre- 
earthquake levels in the third quarter. Scheduled production for the non-Japanese nameplates, the 
black circle, is boosted by a modest increase in light truck assemblies at General Motors and Chrysler— 
who have announced plans to add production shifts at several plants this quarter—and additional 
output from a newly opened Volkswagen plant in Tennessee. Second, U.S. automakers’ capacity is not 
binding at present: A rate of production at about 9  million units in the third quarter remains well below 
U.S. production capacity of more than 12 million units. Moreover, at the firm level, almost all 
automakers would have a noticeable margin of slack capacity if production were to proceed in the third 
quarter at the forecasted rate. (The only exception is Toyota, for which the implied utilization rate for 
autos, but not light trucks, would be somewhat elevated.) Finally, while reliable data on production in 
July are not yet available, industry contacts and the business press remain confident that parts 
availability has improved and that increases in assemblies along the lines of what we envision are 
already in progress. 1  [ F o o t n o t e  1 .  R e p o r t s  o n  T o y o t a  a n d  N i s s a n  i n d i c a t e  t h a t  a s s e m b l i e s  i n  b o t h  J a p a n  a n d  t h e  U n i t e d  S t a t e s  a r e  r e c o v e r i n g  m o r e  q u i c k l y  t h a n  o r i g i n a l l y  e x p e c t e d ;  h o w e v e r ,  t h e  r e s u m p t i o n  o f  n o r m a l  p r o d u c t i o n  a t  H o n d a  i s  r e p o r t e d l y  l a g g i n g  a  b i t .

from Japan to the United States began to recover in June.
1 Reports on Toyota and Nissan indicate that assemblies in both Japan and the United States are 
recovering more quickly than originally expected; however, the resumption of normal production at 
Honda is reportedly lagging a bit.

Housing activity remains exceptionally weak.  Although single-family housing 
starts moved up to an annual rate of 453,000 units in June, a low level of permit issuance 
in the sector suggests that most of this gain  will be reversed in the next few months.  
Similarly, sales of new and existing single-fam ily homes have failed to gain traction in 
recent months.  The overhang of unsold existi ng homes, tight underwriting standards for 
mortgage loans, and uncertainty about future home prices will likely continue to 
constrain demand for new homes over the near term, while limited availability of credit 
for builders is report edly impeding supply in the few areas where demand is improving.  
As a result, we expect single-family housing starts to remain relatively flat over the second half of the year at an annual rate  of about 420,000 units, a level similar to our 
projection in the June Tealbook.  In contrast, starts in the mu ltifamily sector are expected 
to continue edging up, as rising demand for apartments has pushed down vacancy rates 
and put upward pressure on rents. 
Business Investment 
We have downgraded our near-term projec tion for equipment and software (E&S) 
spending considerably.  In th e first half of this year, real E&S outlays rose about 
1½ percentage points more slowly than we had previously estimated, primarily due to 
downward revisions to software expenditures.   In addition, orders  and shipments of 
nondefense capital goods through June came in modestly below our expectations, and 
indicators of business sentiment have deterior ated considerably in recent months.  These 
softer data, in conjunction with the much weaker business output  growth—both in recent 
history and in our projection—led  us to revise down our proj ection for E&S growth in the 
second half of this year to an annual rate of  about 6 percent, compared with an 11 percent 
pace in the June Tealbook.  
Real business outlays on nonres idential structures appear  to have stabilized at a 
very low level in recent months.  In the firs t half of this year, outlays for buildings 
continued to decline on average.  And with  vacancies elevated, construction financing  
still tight, and architectural billings having softened some, we expect building outlays to 
slip a bit further in the sec ond half of this year.  In c ontrast, outlays for drilling and 
mining structures surged in the first half of  this year, and high oil prices and recent  
increases in indicators of drilling activity poi nt to further solid ga ins in the second half. 
As noted previously, the supply disrupti ons associated with the earthquake in 
Japan led to a sharp drop in motor vehicl e inventories in the second quarter, but the

projected rebound in production is  expected to result in a s ubstantial rebuilding of these 
stocks this quarter and next.  Elsewhere, the available data su ggest that inventory 
investment picked up in the second quarter by more than we were expecting.  Given the 
sluggish pace of business sales last quarter,  we suspect that this  run-up was at least 
partially unintended.  Indeed, the ISM surv ey responses suggest some businesses may 
have become less comfortable with the curren t level of inventories.  We expect that 
stockbuilding will slow over the second half of this year as businesses work to keep 
inventory imbalances from emerging. 
Government 
Real federal purchases turned up in th e second quarter and are expected to 
increase moderately in the second half of this year.  Earlier this year, defense purchases 
were well below the level of appropriations, bu t real defense expenditures rose briskly in 
the second quarter.  We expect similar increas es in the current quarter as spending moves 
back in line with appropri ations and then no further ch ange in the fourth quarter. 
At the state and local level,  real purchases have conti nued to decline in response 
to budgetary pressures.  Real state and local purchases fell at an annual rate of about 
3 percent in the second quarter, a decline about ½ percentage point larger than we had 
expected in the June Tealbook, as governme nts continued to trim payrolls and 
construction outlays fell sharply.  We expect job cuts to contin ue at close to their recent 
pace through autumn, whereas declines in cons truction spending are anticipated to start to 
taper off.  As a result, total real state and lo cal purchases are projecte d to contract further 
in the second half of this year, albeit less rapidly than in the first half.  
Foreign Trade 
Real exports of goods and serv ices rose at an annual rate of 6 percent in the 
second quarter, down from an 8 percent rate in  the first quarter and 4¼ percentage points 
slower than we anticipated in the June T ealbook.  We view this w eakness as transitory 
and expect export growth to pick up to a 10 pe rcent pace in the second half of this year, 
supported by solid foreign growth a nd the lower value of the dollar. 
Real imports of goods and services incr eased a modest 1¼ pe rcent in the second 
quarter of this year, about 1¼ percentage points lower th an previously estimated on 
account of weaker-than-expected real imports of oil.  In th e current quarter, we expect

imports to rise more than 8 percent, pu shed up by a rebound in automotive imports from 
Japan, before flattening out in th e fourth quarter as the surge in auto imports fades.  Our 
forecast for import growth in the second half of the year is about 1½ percentage points 
lower than in the June Tealbook, reflecting the markdown in U.S. GDP growth and the 
lower path for the dollar.  
With exports outpacing imports, the extern al sector added roughly ½ percentage 
point to real GDP gr owth in the second quarter, about ¼ percentage point less than 
estim
ated in the June Tealbook because of w eaker exports.  We expect net exports to 
make another ½ percentage point contribution to  GDP growth in the s econd half of this 
year, ¼ percentage point hi gher than in the June Tealbook, as slower U.S. demand 
restrains imports.  
Prices and Wages 
The incoming data on inflation have been somewhat higher than we expected on 
balance.  In the June CPI release, the increa ses in prices for both core goods and services 
were a bit larger than we anticipated—a th ird month of upward surprises—and these data 
were reflected in higher market-based core PCE inflation in June.  Ho wever, the effect of 
that miss on core PCE inflation was masked by a large, unexpected decline in nonmarket-
based PCE prices that month.  On net, core PC E prices are estimated to have increased at 
an annual rate of a littl e more than 2 percent in the second quarter, in line with the June 
Tealbook; core PCE inflation is e xpected to remain near 2 perc ent in the current quarter.  
We continue to think that the midyear bulge in  core inflation reflects temporary factors to 
a large degree.  For example, tight supplies have boosted motor vehicle prices in recent 
months, and this influence should lessen as in ventories are rebuilt.  In addition, increases 
in import and commodity prices have helped  push up other goods prices, particularly 
apparel, this year.  However, given the striking drop in cotton prices  in recent weeks and 
the projected deceleration in import prices, th ese pressures should start to fade in coming 
months.  As a result, we have core PCE inflation slowing to a 1¾ percent pace in the 
fourth quarter.  Nonetheless, our forecast for core inflation in the second half is 
¼ percentage point higher than in the previ ous Tealbook, as we now expect some of these 
transitory factors to unwind more slowly.  Meanwhile, total PCE price inflation is 
expected to slow from an averag e annual rate of 3½ per cent in the first half of this year to 
about 1¼ percent in the second half, reflecting an outright decline in consumer energy 
prices and a significant slowi ng in food price inflation.

We now estimate that compensation pe r hour in the nonfarm business sector 
increased at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in  the first half of th is year, and the ECI 
measure of hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 2½ percent over the same  
period.  Both increases are up a little from  their pace in 2010 but remain moderate.  
Increases in the first half were boosted in part by a surge in empl oyer contributions to 
retirement and savings plans and a large increase in nonproducti on bonuses, neither of 
which are likely to be repeated in the near  term.  In addition, the monthly data on wages 
and salaries through June sugge st that compensation is on a lower trajectory going into 
the second half of this year than we had projected previously; these data, coupled with the 
weaker outlook for the labor market, led us to nudge down our forecast for compensation 
growth in the third and fourth quarters. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
Broadly speaking, the forces shaping the recovery and its general contour of a 
gradual and modestly paced upturn are the same as in recent projections.  In an 
environment of highly accommodative mone tary policy, we still expect a gradual 
improvement in credit availability and a pickup in consumer confidence from today’s 
extraordinarily low levels to generate an increase in economic growth.  But the further 
accumulation of weaker data on spending, production, and the labor market during the intermeeting period, together with the recent deterioration in measures of business and  
consumer sentiment, have led us to project a persistently weaker trajectory for economic 
growth in the second half of this year and in 2012.  All told, excl uding the effects of the 
earthquake in Japan, we now project real GDP growth to move up from a downward-
revised annual rate of 1¼ percen t in the first half of this y ear to 2 percent in the second 
half and 3 percent in 2012.  On this basis, our projection for real GDP growth is nearly 
1 percentage point lower than in the June Tealbook in the second half and ½ percentage 
point lower next year. 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook   
   Perhaps the most significant area of concer n on the spending side of the picture is 
the household sector.  The disappointing news on consumer spending, employment, 
income, and sentiment suggest that consumers will remain on the sidelines until a more substantial recovery materializes in the labor  market.  As in previous projections, we 
assume that as job growth begins to impr ove and energy prices level out, real household 
incomes should gradually rise and confidence should improve, driving a modest 
acceleration in consumption over the medium te rm.  But relative to the June Tealbook,

we have marked down our projection for r eal PCE growth by ¾ percentage point this 
year to 1½ percent and by ¼ percentage point next year to 2½ per cent.  We have the 
personal saving rate remaining fair ly flat over the medium term. 
We continue to see no meaningful rec overy in the housing sector within the 
projection period.  Eventually, rising incom
e and confiden ce, along with improving credit 
availability, should support some pickup in the demand for housing.  But with house 
prices likely to continue dec lining through most of next year, demand is projected to be 
restrained by fears of purchas ing into a falling market.  More over, much of the expected 
increase in housing demand will likely be satisfied by the large stock of low-priced 
vacant homes and less-expensive dwellings in  multiunit buildings rather than new single-
family housing.  As a result, single-family starts  are projected to inch  up to an annual rate 
of only 500,000 units by the end of next year, le ss than half of the average rate over the 
past 40 years. 
Spending by all levels of government is  projected to remain subdued over the 
medium term.  At the federal level, the r ecently enacted legislation raising the debt 
ceiling imposes a tight environment for discretio nary appropriations, as we expected, and 
with stimulus-related nondefense spending pha sing out and outlays related to overseas 
military operations expected to wind down, real federal purchases are projected to decelerate from a modest increase in the s econd half of 2011 to a small decline in 2012.  
At the state and local level, tight budgets wi ll continue to restrain spending over the 
medium term, and we expect real state and lo cal purchases to decrease at an annual rate 
of 1¼ percent in the second half of this year, a slightly weaker project ion than in the June 
Tealbook, and to be about flat in 2012.  Alt hough states’ tax receipts  have posted solid 
gains in recent quarters, federal stimulus payments will mostly wind down next year, and 
further increases in tax revenues will be lim ited by the relatively subdued expansion in 
economic activity in our current forecast. 
In the business sector, elevated vacancy rates, as well as tight financing for 
construction, are expected to continue to rest rain outlays for nonresid ential buildings over 
the medium term.  In addition, because of subs tantial planning lags and other factors, the 
sector typically trails  the rest of the economy, and we e xpect this pattern to hold in the 
current recovery as well.  As a result, we project investment in nonresidential structures 
to continue to edge lower through 2012.

tepid pace of the overall recovery and the climate of uncer tainty that businesses are 
facing.  To be sure, business outlays on E&S have registered several quarters of brisk 
increases over the past two years, but the level of investment remains low enough that, 
after accounting for the rapid pace at which E& S depreciates, the expansion of productive 
capacity has been fairly subdued.  Of c ourse, as business prospects improve and 
uncertainty diminishes, businesses with access to capital markets or with substantial 
retained earnings seem well positioned to e xpand capacity more rapidly.  That said, we  
have marked down our forecast for E&S spending over the forecast period in response to the recent retrenchment in business sentiment and the weaker outlook for sales growth in 
our projection.  In particular, we now project growth in real E&S investment to average 
about 5½ percent next year, about 2½ percenta ge points less than in the June Tealbook 
projection.    
Foreign demand is projected to provide an im
 portant source of support to real 
activity.  Real exports are pr ojected to rise 9 percent in  2012, supported by solid foreign 
growth—especially in the emerging market economies—and by past and projected dollar depreciation.  We estimate that real imports  will increase 3¼ percent next year, with the 
pull of U.S. economic activity restrained somewh at by the weak dollar.  In all, net exports 
are expected to contribute ¾ percentage point to real GDP  growth in 2012, a slightly 
larger contribution than in the June Tealbook, primarily due to the effect of the weaker 
U.S. outlook on import growth. 
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR  MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU 
With no reason to doubt our prior estimate  of the unemployment rate gap, we 
responded to the BEA’s downward revisions to  actual GDP in recent years by marking 
down our estimates of potential GDP from 2008 to 2010 by an equal amount, thus preserving our previous estimate of the GDP  gap at the end of 2010.  We implemented 
this revision to potential GDP growth by adjusting our estimate of multifactor 
productivity (MFP) growth.  Previously, the data indicated that output per hour held up 
surprisingly well during the r ecession, which we had interp reted as partly reflecting 
structural factors.  However, with actu al productivity growth revised down, there no 
longer appears to have been a substantial pi ckup in the underlying tr end in MFP growth.

Indeed, we now estimate that structural M FP has been increasing at about a 1 percent 
annual pace since 2005 and assume that a similar rate will prevail over the forecast 
period.  As a result, we have potential GDP increasing just over 2 percent in 2011 and 
2012, ¼ percentage point lower than in the June Tealbook.  We have maintained our 
assumption that the NAIRU will remain at 6 percent through 2012.2   
Productivity and the Labor Market 
In line with the weaker outlook for out put growth, we have adjusted down our 
forecast for employment growth.  Specifica lly, we now project that average monthly 
private employment gains will edge up from  about 130,000 in the second half of this year 
to about 200,000 in 2012; next year’s proj ected pace is about 30,000 per month lower 
than in our previous projection.  We also expect government employment to trend lower 
through the middle of next year.  With job opportunities expected to be more limited over 
the medium term, the projected path for the une mployment rate is higher than anticipated 
in the June Tealbook, while the path for the labor fo rce participation rate is  a little lower.      
   We judge the current level of labor produc tivity to be roughly in line with our 
estimate of its structural level.  As a re sult, our forecast calls for job growth that 
strengthens with the projected  acceleration in production ove r the medium term and for 
labor productivity to increase roughly in line with  its structural rate of growth.   
                                                 
  
  
  
  
   Resource Utilization 
We now expect greater economic slack to prevail over the projection period than 
was anticipated in the June  Tealbook.  We judge the unemployment rate to be 
2¾ percentage points above th e “effective” NAIRU in the current quarter, and our 
projection has the unemployment gap bare ly narrowing—to about 2½ percentage 
points—by the end of 2012; at that point, it  would be about ½ pe rcentage point wider 
than in the June Tealbook.  We have also increased our estimate of the GDP gap over the 
projection period, with the output gap at th e end of 2012 at 5¼ per cent, 1 percentage 
point wider than in the June Tealbook.  Li kewise, we lowered our forecast for capacity 
utilization in the manufacturing sector, but it returns fairly close to its longer-run average 
2 Our estimate of the “effective” NAIRU, which includes the influence of extended and emergency 
unemployment benefits and is the level of the unemploymen t rate that we view as being consistent with no 
slack in resource utilization, is unrevised from the June projection and is now about 6½ percent.  As before, 
we expect the effective NAIRU to d ecline to around 6 percent by the end of 2012 when the extended and 
emergency unemployment benefit programs wind down.

by the end of 2012.  The difference in gaps between the industri al sector and the 
economy as a whole reflects more-modest incr eases in industrial capacity relative to 
potential output over the recove ry period, as well as faster  growth in industrial output 
than in the rest of the economy. 
Compensation and Prices 
With the unemployment rate projected to be higher than in the previous forecast, 
we have lowered our projection of the incr ease in compensation per hour in the second 
half of 2011 and in 2012, to 1¾ percent and 2¼ percent, respectivel y.  We have also 
made a small downward revision to our projec tion of changes in the employment cost 
index.  As in the June Tealbook, the projecte d increases in compen sation, combined with 
our forecast for productivity, im ply little change, on average,  in unit labor costs over the 
forecast period. 
Prices for imported core goods (all goods  excluding fuels, computers, and 
semiconductors) are projected to rise 3 percent in the current quarter, considerably slower 
than the 6¼ percent increase recorded in th e second quarter, as foreign inflation steps 
down, commodity prices flatten out, and dolla r depreciation slows.  Over the remainder 
of the projection period, core import price inflation is e xpected to run at about a 
1½ percent pace as commodity prices remain relatively flat and the dollar depreciates 
only modestly.  
Recent readings on inflation expectations have been mixed but generally suggest 
that longer-term expectations have remained stable.  Median 5-to-10-year-ahead expected 
inflation from the Michigan survey was 2.9 pe rcent in July, a touch below the 3 percent 
reading in June and in the middle of the ra nge seen over the past  decade.  TIPS-based 
measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead have 
both increased nearly ¼ percentage point si nce the June Tealbook, but changes in those 
measures have been particularly hard to interpret in light of safe-haven flows. 
The contour of our core inflation projec tion over the medium term reflects the 
anticipated fading of transito ry pressures that have booste d inflation this year.  We  
assume that inflation expectations will remain stable and that the unemployment rate gap 
will decline only slightly next year.  As a result, with pressures from commodity and 
import prices fading, core inflation is expected to slow from about 1¾ percent this year to 
1½ percent in 2012.  Given this step-down in co re inflation and an expected deceleration

in consumer energy and food prices, headline PCE price inflation is  projected to slow 
from 2½ percent in 2011 to 1½ percent in  2012.  Relative to the June Tealbook, our 
topline inflation forecast is  a little higher this year in response to the higher-than-
expected incoming data on core prices.  However, the small resulting inflationary impetus 
to our forecast next year is offset by the lower level of resource utilization.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2015 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assessments of long-run supply- side conditions, fisc al policy, and other factors.  The 
contour of the long-run outlook depe nds on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long 
run, consistent with th e majority of longer-term inflation projections 
provided by FOMC participan ts at the June meeting. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities follow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B.  The projected longer-run decline in the 
System’s holdings is forecast to contri bute about 25 basis points to the rise 
in the 10-year Treasury yiel d over the period from 2013 to 2015. 
  The modest effects of the anticipa ted credit rating downgrade that we 
assume are already priced into yields  on U.S. Treasury securities persist 
beyond 2012; those effects are also assumed to lift private yields 
somewhat.  In addition, risk premiu ms on corporate equities decline 
gradually to normal levels, and banks ease their lending standards 
somewhat further.   
  The federal government budget defic it (NIPA basis) narrows from  
6¾ percent of GDP in 2012 to 4½ pe rcent of GDP in 2015.  While the 
effects of the economic recovery on ta x receipts make a large contribution 
to this narrowing of the deficit, about 1 percentage point of the narrowing reflects our assumption of policy actions starting in 2013 that are consistent with the recent budget legislation. 
  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate 
2¼ percent in 2013 and then declin e 1 percent in both 2014 and 2015.  
The price of WTI crude oil is roughly flat at slightly more than $100 per

barrel during the extension period, consistent with futures prices adjusted 
for divergences between staff and market expectations for economic 
activity and exchange rates.  Fore ign real GDP expands, on average, 
3½ percent per year from 2013 th rough 2015, above its trend rate. 
  The NAIRU declines from 6 percen t in late 2012 to 5¼ percent by 2015 
as the functioning of the labor m
arket improves.  Potential GDP expands 
almost 2½ percent per year, on average, over the 2013–15 period. 
The economy enters 2013 with  output still considerably  below its potential, the 
unemployment rate well above the projected NAIRU, and inflation below the assumed 
objective.  In the long-run forecast, improvi ng confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and 
supportive financial conditions eventually en able the level of aggregate demand to 
approach aggregate supply.  In this environment, real GDP rises at an average annual rate 
of almost 4 percent from 2013 to 2015, faster than its potential pace; as a result, 
unemployment declines appreciably, reachi ng 5¾ percent by late 2015, while inflation 
edges up to 1.6 percent in 2015.

Appendix 
Annual Revision of the National  Income and Product Accounts 
On July 29, the Bureau of Economic Analysis  (BEA) released its annual revision to the 
national income and product accounts (NIPA).  The adjusted estimates incorporate newly  
available or revised data—such as the Census Bureau’s annual surveys and tabulations from the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)—as well as so me changes in methodology.  These revisions 
mainly affected historical NIPA estimates from 2008 to 2010.1  The four-quarter change in real 
GDP was revised down ½ percentage point in 2008 and ¾ percentage point in 2009, while the 
four-quarter change in 2010 was revised up about ¼ percentage point.   
These estimates indicate that the recent cycli cal downturn was deeper than previously 
reported and that the recovery proceeded at a s lightly slower pace through the first quarter of 
2011.  Although the dates of the peak (2007:Q4) and trough (2009:Q2) of real GDP remain the 
same, the contraction from  peak to trough is now estimated to have been about 5 percent— 
1 percentage point larger than in previous estim ates and nearly 1½ percentage points steeper than 
the next-largest postwar contraction in late 1957 and early 1958.  Moreover, in contrast to previous estimates, it now appears that as of the second quarter of 2011, real GDP remained 
slightly below its peak level in the fourth quarter of 2007.  Quarterly estimates of real gross domestic income (GDI) were also marked down a little, on net, and these revisions now place real 
GDP and real GDI on very  similar growth trajectories from 2008 to 2010.  
The pattern of revisions to real GDP between 2008 and 2010 largely resulted from  
revised estimates for private domestic final expe nditures.  Most notably, real PCE is now 
estimated to have fallen more s ubstantially in both 2008 and 2009 th an previously thought and to 
have rebounded at a somewhat faster rate in 2010.
2  The downward revision to real PCE in recent 
years was widespread across major spending categories and was accompanied by a downward revision to real disposable personal income (DPI).   These revisions left the personal saving rate at 
the end of 2010—5¼ percent—only a little below the previous estimate, and still well above the rate that had prevailed at the end of 2007.  The downward revision to DPI is mainly explained by  
much lower estimates of personal interest inco me, reflecting newly  available IRS tabulations 
through 2009 and changes to the methodology used to calculate mortgage interest.  In addition, 
1 This release marked the debut of “flexible an nual revisions” wherein the BEA may choose to 
revise NIPA estimates further back in history than th e traditional three-year window in order to incorporate 
new source data or changes in methodology.  In this year’s revision, relatively small changes were made to 
current-dollar estimates for some series—such as GDP, PCE, and fixed investment—from 2003 to 2007, and chained-dollar estimates for these series were revised throughout history. 
2 Revisions to fixed investment followed a similar yearly pattern as those to PCE and were 
concentrated in the nonresidential sector.  Change s to estimates of government spending, inventory 
investment, and net exports were fairly modest on balance.

employee compensation was marked down somewh at, on net, mostly in response to downward-
revised estimates of employer contributions to employee pensions and insurance funds.  
By contrast, corporate profits were marked up substantially in both 2009 and 2010.  
These latest esti
mates place the share of economic profits in gross national product at the end of 
2010 at nearly 12½ percent, about 1¼ percenta ge points above the previous estimate.  Both 
domestic financial and nonfina ncial profits were revised up noticeably on balance. 
Revisions to the BEA’s estimates of consumer prices were modest and were largely  
concentrated in 2010.  Estimated rates of increase in both total and core PCE prices were 
unchanged in 2008 and 2009 but were revised up ab out ¼ percentage point in 2010, reflecting 
upward-revised price increases in the nonmarket category.  Revisions to the market-based 
component of PCE prices were minor. 
The annual NIPA revision also provided inform ation about the likely magnitude of the 
upcoming revision to estimates of  productivity and hourly comp ensation in the nonfarm business 
sector.  Working from the updated NIPA data, the Bo ard staff estimates that output per hour in 
the nonfarm  business sector dropped 1¼ percent over the four quarters of 2008 before jumping 
5¼ percent in 2009 and rising 2½ percent in 20 10; the new figures would leave the productivity  
level in the fourth quarter of 2010 about  1½ pe rcent below the previous estimate.  The downward-
revised estimates of employee compensation imply somewhat smaller increases in hourly  
compensation in recent years, on balance, with th e level of compensation per hour in the fourth 
quarter of 2010 down about ½ percent from prev ious estimates.  Taken together, these revised 
productivity and compensation figures would imply that the level of unit labor costs at the end of 
2010 was about 1 percent higher than previously thought.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
As expected at the time of the June Tealbook, foreign activity slowed 
significantly in the second quarter, but data indicate a somewhat larger deceleration than  
anticipated.  We estimate  that r eal GDP  growth  fell from  4¼ percent at an annual rate in  
the first quarter to  2¼ percent in the second , about  ½ percentage point below our previous  
forecast .  The step -down in foreign GDP  growth reflected  a slowing of  many  economies  
toward more sustainable  growth rates, the spillover  effects of the Japanese earthquake 
and tsunami, and anemic  growth in the United States.  So far,  we are not interpreting the 
step-down in foreign economic performance  as  reflect ing  a persistent and deep -seated  
softening of private domestic demand, but staff  will be alert to signs of such weakness in  
the coming quarters.  
The contour of our forecast remains roughly the same as in June, with economic 
growth rebounding in the second half of this  year, as the downdrafts from Japan’s  
earthquake abate and the U.S. economy  accelerates.  However, increased headwinds — 
from a weaker  U.S. outlook and greater concerns  over sovereign debt in Europe—have 
led us to mark down real GDP growth abroad about ¼ percentage point over the forecast  
period.  Foreign aggregate r eal GDP is  now  projected to increase 3½  percent at an annual  
rate both in the second half of this  year  and in 2012. 
Since the June Tealbook, financial conditions in Europe have  worsened, despite  
the passage of Greece’s fiscal  austerity program and the announcement of  measures  
designed to shore up vulnerable  countries.  Most troubling  has been the increase in  
market scrutiny of  Italy  and Spain.  Our baseline forecast  assume s  that Europe will  
manage to avoid a major  crisis but that continued financial  stresses and  more stringent  
fiscal consolidation  will weigh on  economic growth.  Moreover, the  risk of  severe 
financial  disruptions in Italy, Spain, and perhaps other euro -area countries  has increased  
since June. 
Foreign inflation was 3¼ percent  at  an annual rate  in the second quarter, down 
from its peak of 5¼ percent in the fourth quarter  of last  year, and is expected to continue  
to edge lower  as the effects of  previous food and energy price increases dissipate.  
Inflation is projected to fall to just under 2½ percent in 2012, contingent on the staff’s  
expectation  that commodity prices  flatten out.

ADVANCED FOREIGN  ECONOMIES  
We estimate that GDP  growth in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) slowed 
sharply  from 2½ percent  in the first quarter to a meager ¾  percent in the second.  
Although we had built in some moderation, the step-down was nearly ¾ percentage point  
greater than we had projected i n June, reflecting downward surprises  related to temporary  
factors  in Canada and the United Kingdom.  We expect the pace of  growth to recover to a 
modest 2½ percent in the third quarter, as Japan’s  economy snaps back, and then to hover  
around a 2¼ percent  pace through 2012.  This pace is ¼  percentage point lower than that 
in the June Tealbook in view of the weaker trajectory  for U.S. growth and the  
intensification of  financial  stresses in Europe.  Greece’s near -term prospects improved 
over the intermeeting  period, but the spread of contagion to Spain and Italy, and the  
failure of the European leaders’ summit agreement to address that problem, point to 
continued risks to the outlook in  Europe.  We expect  Italy  and Spain now will  enact  
greater austerity measur es to try to  assuage market concerns.  
We estimate that AFE inflation fell from 3¼ percent  at an  annual rate in the first 
quarter to 2¼ percent in the second, partly  reflecting the waning influence of the earlier  
jump  in energy prices .  Going forward, with energy  and food prices projected to flatten 
and output gaps  closing slowly, we have AF E inflation stabilizing near 1½  percent over  
the remainder of the forecast period.  Given greater concerns about  economic growth, we  
now expect the major central b anks to conduct  somewhat  more accommodative monetary  
policies than previously  anticipated.  
Japan  
The Japanese economy is recovering from the March earthquake and tsunami  
more rapidly than we had expected.  Exports and industrial production have already  
retraced m uch of their substantial losses, while significant progress has been made to 
restart operations in the hard-hit automobile industry.  Survey  data also have been  
encouraging, with the June  PMI  indicating  that supply chain bottlenecks have largely  
waned.  We  now estimate that real GDP fell 3 percent last quarter, a contraction that was  
¾ percent age point smaller  than projected in the June Tealbook.  Going forward, w e have 
output rising at a 4½ percent pace in the second half of the  year, an estimate which has  
been  revised up a bit  as downside risks have receded .  GDP g rowth  should then slow to 
2½ percent in 2012, down ¼ percentage point from the previous Tealbook,  in line with  
somewhat weaker  U.S. growth and a stronger  yen.

The swift Japanese recovery has  been facilitated by  government relief programs.   
On July 15, the Japanese  Diet approved a ¥2 trillion (about $25 billion, or nearly  
½ percent of GDP) disaster -relief package, which followed the ¥4 trillion supplementary  
budget  enacted in May.  We expect that a third and larger supplementary budget will be  
passed before the  end of  the  year.  Although Japan has continued to run large budget  
deficits —with gross  debt reaching  an estimated 200  percent of GDP in 2010—sovereign 
yields have actually  edged down , and financial markets expect the rate on  10-year JGBs  
to remain below 1.5 percent over the forecast period.  We assume that the Bank of Japan  
will incr ease the size of its asset purchase program from ¥10 trillion to ¥15 trillion by 
year-end.  
Consumer prices resumed declining in the second quarter ,  as  expected,  after rising  
½ percent  at an annual rate in the first .  As the output gap narrows, de flation sh ould 
moderate from ½  percent in the second half of 2011 to ¼ percent at the  end of 2012. 
Euro Area  
Our assessment of  economic conditions in the euro area  has worsened over the  
intermeeting period .  We had expected  economic  growth to step down in the second 
quarter after  an  unsustainably strong f  irst-quarter  performance in the largest euro -area 
economies, and this view has been supported by incoming indicators.  Industrial  
production barely  edged up in May, and retail sales  were down in the second quarter.  
Business  confidence and the composite PMI  also  weakened in the second  quarter  and fell  
further in July.  
The sharp decline in sentiment in July  likely  reflected  the ratcheting up  of 
financial tensions in Europe.  Sovereign spreads initially declined in resp onse to the  
successful passage of  Greek austerity measures,  which secured official financing needed  
to avert a disorderly Greek default in July.  But subsequently, spreads soar ed to new  
heights  amid c ontentious and protracted negotiations about  a second  rescue package for  
Greece.  Even more  worrisome , spreads for  Spain and Italy  ran up substantially, in part  
reflecting  concerns about the coherence of the regional crisis management strategy , and 
have climbed even higher in early August.  On July  21, euro- area leaders announced the  
rescue package for Greece, which was  intended to cover much of Greece’s funding needs  
for the next decade and to elicit some debt relief from private creditors.  In addition to 
€109 billion in new  official financing  for Greece , the leaders  agreed to  significantly  
reduce the costs and extend the maturities  of euro -area  financing to Greece,  Ireland,  and  
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Portugal and to broaden the scope and flexibility of the European Financial  Stability  
Facility (EFSF) .  
While the package offered Greece some  c lear help in meeting its obligations,  
several risks remain for  Greece and  for the euro area.  T he extent  to which the private 
sector  will participat e in the debt restructuring  and  how successful Greece will be in  
achiev ing  its fiscal and privatization targets  are not clear .  The willingness  of the  official 
sector t o make up any  future  financing  shortfalls  is also not certain,  and regaining market  
access is doubtful given that  Greek  sovereign debt  is still not on a convincingly 
sustainable trajectory.   In addition, the package did not increase  the  overall size  of the  
EFSF, leaving it inadequate to  backstop Italy and Spain should financial troubles  
intensify there .  
On balance, since the June forecast financial  conditions have improved somewhat  
for Greece but  are demonstrably worse for  Italy and Spain, where sovereign , bank, and 
corporate spreads are well above levels observed in mid -June.  Over the next several  
years , we expect that financial conditions in the euro area  will remain strained with  
occasional bouts of more pronounced turbulence.  These stresses  will keep borrowing  
costs elevated, weigh on consumer and business  confidence, and add to pressures for  
near-term fiscal  consolidation.  Although we  assume European pol icymakers will manage  
to avert a deeper crisis that generates  global financial spillovers,  such a crisis  remain s  a 
distinct possibility.   (See t he Risks and Uncertainty  section for a discussion of  the 
implications of a  severe crisis in Italy and Spain.)   Moreover, Greece wi ll require more  
drastic private -sector  restructuring, more official funds, or both, by 2014 (when Greece is  
slated to return to private financial markets for additional financing), if not earlier .  
With tighter financial conditions,  more -restrictive fiscal policy, and weaker  
external demand , we  have  lowered our projection for euro-area output  and  now  expect  
GDP  growth  to be only 1 percent in the second half of 2011 before  it ris es to 1¾ percent  
by the  end of 2012.  This forecast is about ¼ percentage point lower than in the June  
Tealbook.  
Euro -area inflation, after  surging  to an annual rate  of 3¾ percent in the first  
quarter on the back of higher energy prices, fell to 2¾ percent  in the second, and the July  
data are consistent with a sharp  further decline this quarter.  Amid persistent slack, we  
expect inflation to  average about 1½ percent  over the forecast period, a touch lower than 
that in the June Tealbook.  On July 7, the ECB raised its benchmark policy  rate 25 basis 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook

points to 1½ percent.  Given the weaker outlook for  economic growth and inflation, we  
now expect the ECB to raise its policy rate  only  once more by the  end of 2012, to 
1¾ percent .  
Canada  
We significantly lowered our estimate of second -quarter GDP growth to 
¾ percent  at an annual rate in response  to weaker  external demand and  lower oil 
production in May , the latter a result of  maintenance operations and  forest fires  that 
limited access to oil fields .  Nonetheless , incoming indicators  for domestic  activity ha ve 
remained positive overall, with employment posting strong g  ains through June, 
investment activities continuing at a solid pace, and credit conditions easing further.  We  
expect GDP growth to snap back to almost 3 percent in the third quarter, higher than 
projected in the June Tealbook, as oil production recovers  and part shortages at auto 
plants are resolved.  Thereafter, output is projected to rise at a moderate 2¼  percent pace 
over the remainder of the forecast period.  Relative to the previous Tealbook, GDP  
growth is down ¼ percentage point this  year and next, reflecting the  recent  appreciation 
of the Canadian dollar  and the weaker U.S. outlook. 
Inflation  was 3 percent in the second quarter, ½ percentage point less than 
projected in the previous  Tealbook, as core prices  decelerated noticeably in June.  The 
June surprise is largely  attributable to aggressive discounts on automobiles  that are 
expected to last through most of the summer, prompting us to revise down our third-
quarter inflation f orecast  to an annual pace of ½ percent .  Thereafter,  inflation should 
move back up to around the  Bank  of Canada’s (BOC)  2 percent target over the remainder  
of the forecast period.  Given subdued inflation and somewhat softer  external demand, 
we have lowered the BOC’s path of monetary tightening and now expect  its main policy  
rate to rise to 1½ percent  by the  end of 2012, ½ percentage point less than in the previous  
Tealbook.  
United Kingdom  
According to the preliminary estimate, U.K.  GDP grew  only ¾ percent  at an  
annual rate in the second quarter, significantly less than we projected in June.  T he 
downside surprise is attributable to a greater -than-expected drag on activity associated  
with the Royal Wedding hol  iday and production disruptions following the Ja panese 
earthquake.   Accordingly, w e expect GDP  growth to bounce back to 2½ percent in the 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Page 41 of 110
Authorized for Public Release
third quarter as these factors abate before settling dow  n to a roughly 2¼ percent pace 
over the remainder of the forecast period.  This forecast is a touch lower than in June due  
to weaker  external demand.  
Amid weaker -t han-expected core prices, second -quarter inflation declined to 
3½ percent, ½ percentage point less than projected in the June Tealbook.  Inflation should 
decline further  to 1¾ percent in the current  quarter.  However, hikes in energy tariffs  
have been announced for later this  year, prompting us to bump up our forecast to 
2½ percent on  average over the forecast period , although underlying price  pressures  
should remain contained.  Given recent and prosp ective softer economic growth, and 
despite year -on-year inflation readings exceeding  4 percent  for the next couple of  
quarters, we now assume that the Bank of England will wait until the middle of 2012 
before raising  the Bank Rate to ¾ percent. 
EMERGING MARKET  ECONOMIES  
We estimate that real GDP  growth in the  emerging market economies  (EMEs )  
slowed from an annual rate of 6¼ percent in the first quarter to about 4 percent in the  
second, restrained by the effects of the earthquake in Japan  and weak U.S. growth, and 
reflecting  a return to  a more sustainable pace of activity .  Although these factors  were 
largely built in to the June Tealbook, the tone of the incoming data  was  weaker than we 
had anticipated, leading us   to push down our  estimate  of second- quarter g rowth about  
½ percentage point.  In the current quarter, we see growth in the EMEs  moving up to 
5 percent  with the  restoration of supply chains  that were disrupted by the  crisis in  Japan.   
Real  GDP  growth is then projected to average 4¾ percent  over the remainder of the 
forecast period , roughly  at its trend pace, but  about ¼ percentage point lower than 
forecast  in June, primarily  reflecting the  weaker U.S. outlook.  
Headline consumer price inflation in the EMEs slowed from 5 percent  at an  
annual rate in th e  first quarter to  about 4 percent in the second.  Inflation  over the near  
term is projected to be  a little higher than  anticipated  at the time of the June  Tealbook, 
primarily reflecting  a  renewed burst of  food price  inflation in China.  Nonetheless, w e 
expect that inflation  in the EMEs  will moderate  to about 3 percent  next year , as the 
effects of earlier  increases in commodity prices recede and as  authorities in many  
countries continue to tighten monetary policy.

China  
Chinese real GDP increased 9 percent  at an annual rate in the second quarter, 
around the same pace as  in the first, but other data suggest  that the economy is  slowing a  
touch.  The PMI edged down in recent months, and  industrial production growth 
moderated  in the second quarter.  Domestic demand also  appears to have softened 
somewhat , with retail sales slowing and imports falling in the second quarter.  We have 
lowered our projection of Chinese growth about ¼ percentage point in the second half of  
this year , to 8¼ percent , reflecting the weake r outlook in the advanced economies .  We 
project  growth will remain at about that pace in 2012 as Chinese authorities try to 
modulate fiscal and monetary policy to keep growth solid  while  preventing t  he economy  
from  overheating.  The  possibility that the  authorities will be unable to fine tune  its  
Goldilocks policy, such that the economy either overheats or slows sharply, is a risk to  
the forecast.  
Chinese headline consumer price inflation surged to 6½ percent on a 12-month 
basis in June, up from 5½ percent in May.  Although the  authorities remain concerned  
about inflation, the most recent  run-up appears  to almost entirely  reflect  rising  pork 
prices .  Anecdotes suggest that a supply response  is already in train and that pork prices  
should come down by the end of the summer.  In response to the higher inflation and a s 
part of ongoing efforts to normalize monetary policy, Chinese authorities raised the   
one-year lending and deposit rates to 6.56 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively.  As the 
most recent bout of  food price increases reverses ,  we expect Chinese in flation to move  
down to 2¾ percent early next  year  and then stay  at about that level thereafter.  
Other Emerging Asia  
Elsewhere in  emerging Asia, indicators  suggest that  real GDP  growth  moved 
down to only 2½ percent  in the second quarter  from nearly 8½  percent in the first, a more 
pronounced slow ing than we anticipated at the time of the June Tealbook.  In Korea,  
real GDP  growth  moderated to 3½ percent , as expected,  with  external demand weaken ing  
but domestic demand remaining robust.  However, advance GDP releases  in Taiwan  and 
Singapore were below what  we had projected .  For the rest of the  region, we do not  yet  
have second -quarter GDP  figures  in hand, but PMIs softened and industrial- sector  output  
declined .  Late in the second quarter, the effects of the Japanese earthquake appear to 
have abated ; for example,  auto production has  mostly normalized  in Thailand, a regional  
hub for Japanese automakers.  Going forward , real GDP  growth is projected to bounce

back to a 4½ percent pace through the end of 2012.  This  forecast  is  somewhat lower  than 
in the June Tealbook, as a weaker outlook for the  advanced economies— especially the 
United States —is projected to weigh on Asian exporters.  
Latin America  
Mexico is one of the few  EMEs to retain an appreciable degree of resource slack,  
and little progress in eroding that slack was made in the first half of this  year.   We now  
estimate that real GDP in Mexico  expanded only 2½ percent in the second quarter, 
slightly above  its  anemic first -quarter rate .  This estimate is ½  percentage point below our  
projection in the June Tealbook, in large part  reflecting a downward revision to  
U.S. industrial production, which is an important influence on Mexican activity .  Looking  
ahead, we expect  a rebound in Mexican industrial  production, mirroring that in the  
United States,  to temporarily boost  Mexican  growth to 4¼ percent in the second half of  
the year , with growth then stepping down to about 3½ percent in 2012.  
In South A merica, where economic performance has been far more robust,  
boosted by high commodity prices, data point to a  moderation of activity, from  
7½ pe rcent in the  first quarter to 4  percent  in the second, roughly in line with that in t he 
June Tealbook.  We expe ct  GDP  growth to moderate further, to 3½ percent in 2012, a 
pace which  is somewhat  weaker than our June Tealbook forecast, owing largely to the  
markdown in global  activity .  
Inflation in Mexico fell in the second quarter to 1¾ percent  at an annual rate, 
reflecting  a  temporary  energy subsidy .  Inflation is projected to pick up to 3 percent in the  
current quarter  and  to then settle  at 3¾ percent over the remainder of the  forecast period, 
within the upper bound of the central bank’s target range of 2 to 4 percent.  In Brazil, 
inflation edged down to a still-high 7½ percent in the second quarter.  Since the June  
Tealbook, the central bank of Brazil has raised its benchmark policy  rate 25 basis points  
to 12½ percent in continuing efforts to damp inflation pressures and slow the economy.  Partly as  a result of these efforts, we project  inflation to average 5 percent  over the 
forecast period .  However, with credit  growth still strong, the  risk of overheating persists  
in Brazil.

Financial Developments 
U.S. financial markets were buffeted ove r the intermeeting period by a number of 
developments regarding the fiscal situati on in the United States and Europe and by 
readings on domestic economic activity that were almost uniformly disappointing.  For 
most of July, investor sentiment mainly swung in response to news about the severity of 
the European sovereign debt crisis, alternati ng between disappointment and relief.  Later 
in the period, market particip ants focused on the debate over the U.S. fiscal situation, and 
as the wrangling dragged on and the apparent deadline for raising the debt ceiling neared, 
investors became increasingly anxious.  For a time, a number of money markets exhibited 
significant strains, and there was a surge in the level of domestic bank deposits, sizable 
declines in equity prices, and some pullback in the provision of cred it to both the business 
and household sectors.  The strains in U.S. money markets eased notably in response to 
the legislation to raise the debt ceiling and cut the federal budget deficit that was signed 
into law on August 2.  Nonetheless, investor s’ concerns about the long-term fiscal 
outlook in the United States and Europe persiste d, particularly in light of the apparent 
slowing in global economic activity, and stock prices and Treasury yi elds dropped.     
On balance over the intermeeting period, financial markets reflected a growing 
sense of pessimism regarding the prospect s for global economic growth.  Broad U.S. 
equity price indexes ended the period down a bout 3 percent.  Interest rates declined 
markedly—the 2-year nominal Treasury yiel d decreased 9 basis points, the 10-year 
Treasury yield declined 34 basis points, a nd the 10-year TIPS yield dropped 53 basis 
points.  Moreover, the expected  path for the federal funds ra te flattened substantially, 
with Eurodollar futures rates two years hence down about 60 basis points.  The foreign 
exchange value of the dollar decl ined about 1 percent on net.   
EFFECTS OF SOVEREIGN FISCAL STRESSES ON U.S.  FINANCIAL MARKETS  
For much of the intermeeting period, investor s’ concerns about the fiscal situation  
in Europe were a major driver of U.S. asset prices.  In late June, relief was evident in  
financial markets when Greece appeared to have  narrowly avoided a disorderly default.  
However, over the first half of July, investors generally pulled back from riskier assets as 
scrutiny of sovereign funding needs in the eu ro area intensified and concerns about Italy 
and Spain ratcheted up.  Later in  July, the retreat from risk-t aking abated in reaction to

the agreement reached among European lead ers on July 21 to provide assistance to 
financially vulnerable European countries.  But concerns about the fiscal situation in 
Europe resurfaced amid signs of a slowdown in  global activity.  Further analysis of the 
imprint that these events left on U.S. fina ncial markets over the intermeeting period is 
presented in the box “The European Fiscal Crisis and U.S. Asset Prices.”     
In late July, investors’ focus turned to th e debate over raising the U.S. debt ceiling 
and the potential for delayed or mi
ssed de bt service payments by the Treasury 
Department, the possibility of a downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, and the prospects for 
significant longer-term fiscal consolidation.  Up until the last week in July, these 
concerns were not especially evident in fi nancial markets.  But investor sentiment 
changed markedly that week, and short-date d CDS premiums on Treasury debt climbed.   
At the same time, against the backdrop of i nvestors’ continuing anxiety about European 
exposures, outflows from institutional mone y market mutual funds (MMMFs) ramped up, 
accumulating to about 8 percent of institutional taxable MMMF assets.  Amid surging net 
outflows, fund managers reportedly shortened their investment maturities, pulled back 
from investing in some money markets, and increasingly chose to park cash at their 
custodian banks.   
Reflecting these developments, liquid ity and functioning in money markets 
deteriorated for a time.  Interest rates on a host of short-term funding instruments— 
including federal funds, yields on short-da ted Treasury bills, repurchase agreements 
backed by general collateral (GC repos), agency discount notes, and commercial paper— 
increased markedly.1  Markets for secured funding backed by government-issued or 
government-guaranteed collateral were the most  affected, as evidenced by elevated bid-
asked spreads on GC repos at a range of tenor s, including overnight, and a sharp decline 
in transactions volume.  The spreads between Libor and overn ight index swap (OIS) rates 
increased at one- and three-month horizons but remained within their recent ranges, while 
spreads between forward rate agreements and OIS rates rose, and euro Libor–OIS spreads 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 8 basi s points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.  Late in the period, federal funds traded in the 
high end of their recent range, and the daily effective rate touched 17 basis points on August 1, a rate not seen since March. 
In contrast to the conditions in Treasury bill mark ets, yields on 10- and 30-year nominal Treasury 
securities declined over the same time frame, and liquidity in the markets for longer-term Treasury securities generally remained robust.  Partial and c onfidential data on custody accounts at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York show a slight pickup in U.S. Treasury holdings by foreign official investors in July.

The  European   Fiscal  Crisis  and  U.S.  Asset  Prices  
The  intensification   of  the  European  sovereign  debt  crisis  over  the  intermeeting   
period  exacerbated   conditions   in  some  U.S.  financial  markets.   Most  notably,  the  
U.S.  commercial   paper  (CP)  market  experienced   substantial   strains  as  money  
market  funds  reportedly   increased   their  cash  positions   and  sought  to  decrease  
exposures   to  CP  issued  by  entities  with  less‐than‐stellar  credit.   As  concerns   over  
the  European   crisis  worsened,   the  level  of  U.S.  CP  outstanding   from  institutions   
with  European  parents  contracted   substantially.    Although  these  slides  have  
been  something   of  an  ongoing  trend  in  recent  months,  the  intermeeting   declines  
of  some  issuers  with  parents  from  core  European   countries   were  much  steeper  
than  in  previous  months  (see  top‐left  panel  on  the  facing  page).   In  particular,   the  
CP  outstanding   of  a  few  large  French   banks  contracted  sharply  after  Moody’s  
placed  the  banks  on  watch  for  credit  rating  downgrades.    Moreover,   the  share  of  
CP  issuance  accounted   for  by  tenors  of  four  days  or  less  increased   markedly   for  
European   issuers.     
To  date,  price  adjustments   in  the  CP  market  have  generally   been  orderly.   The  
market  exhibited   increased   rate  tiering,  with   spreads  on  paper  issued  by  
institutions   with  Italian  and  Spanish  parents  widening   to  levels  that  prevailed   last  
summer  (see  top‐right  panel  on  the  facing  page).   However,   spreads  on  paper  
issued  by  institutions   from  other  European   nations  remained   generally   low.   A  
similar  pattern  was  evident  in  the  federal  funds  market  (not  shown),  where  
affected  European   banks  experienced   higher  borrowing   costs  than  their  peers.   
Developments   in  Europe  also  affected  U.S.  financial  markets  more  broadly.   As  
indicated   by  the  negative  covariance   between   the  change  in  the  average  
sovereign   credit  default  swap  (CDS)  premium   of  the  most  debt‐burdened   
European   countries   and  the  daily  percentage   change  in  the  S&P  500  stock  price  
index  (see  middle  panel  on  the  facing  page),  on  many  days  during  the  
intermeeting   period,  U.S.  equity  prices  fell  when  conc erns  about  the  European   
sovereign   debt  crisis  intensified   and  rose  when  they  eased.   The  effect  was  even  
more  apparent   for  the  equity  prices  of  firms  in  the  financial  sector,   presumably   
due  to  concerns   about  the  exposure  of  U.S.  financial  firms  to  European   entities.   
Similarly,  as  indicated   by  the  negative  covariance   between   sovereign  CDS  
spreads  and  changes  in  the  yield  on  the  10‐year  Treasury  note,  Treasury  yields  
were  buffeted  by  flight‐to‐quality  inflows  and  outflows   in  response   to  investors’  
changing   sentiment   regarding   the  fiscal  situation  in  Europe  (see  bottom  panel  on  
the  facing  page).

and euro–dollar implied basis spreads also increased.  In addition, investors in 
commercial paper markets began to require noticeably shorter maturities and higher 
interest rates, even for large, highly rate d nonfinancial corporati ons.  Conditions eased 
noticeably once the agreement in the Congress was enacted, as Treasury bill yields and other money market interest rates generall y declined, transactions volumes increased, 
outflows from MMMFs abated, and fund managers reportedly began working down their 
stockpiles of cash.
2  By contrast, conditions in European money markets remained 
relatively strained.   
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Over the intermeeting period, interest rates seesawed in response to news 
regarding the fiscal situation in the United St ates and European, as well as incoming U.S. 
economic data.  On net, nominal Treasury yi elds declined between  about 10 and 35 basis 
points across the yield curve.  Market-based  measures of uncerta inty about long-term 
Treasury yields increased for a time but then fell back.  The on-schedule completion of 
the Federal Reserve’s Treasury purchase progr am on June 30 appears to have had little 
effect on Treasury yields.3    
Both market- and survey-based expectati ons for the path of monetary policy 
shifted down significantly beyond mid-2012.  The mean path of the federal funds rate 
implied by current futures quotes (with the us ual staff assumptions for term premiums) 
rises above the current target range in the th ird quarter of 2013, three quarters later than 
observed at the time of the June FOMC mee ting.  Quotes on interest rate caps suggest 
that the modal path of the federal funds ra te also declined ove r the period, although by a 
much smaller amount.4  According to the Open Market  Desk’s latest survey, primary 
2 After the close of markets on August 2, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings affirmed 
their AAA credit ratings for the United States but warn ed that downgrades were possible if the Congress 
fails to enact debt reduction measures.  
3 The Open Market Desk completed its purcha ses of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury 
securities under the  second large-scale asset purchase program, which was announced by the FOMC at its 
November 2010 meeting.  Since November 12, 2010, the Desk has purchased a total of $784 billion of 
Treasury securities, reflecting $600 billion of purchases under the second asset purchase program and $184 billion of purchases associated with the reinvestment of principal payments on Federal Reserve holdings of agency MBS and agency debt. The Desk also continued its existing policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities. 
4 The modal path does not incorporate the staff’s usual adjustment for term premiums because 
doing so would lead to some negative values.  Term premiums may currently be unusually low, reflecting investors’ confidence that policy will remain on hold for some time.

dealers pushed out the timing for policy liftoff to around the end of 2012, about two 
quarters later than at the time of the June survey.   
Regarding other results from the dealer  survey, m ost respondents expect the 
upcoming FOMC statement to recognize recent economic weakness and to further 
downgrade the Committee’s outlook for ec onomic growth.  Dealers revised down 
significantly their forecasts of real GDP growth in 2011—to an average of 1.9 percent 
from 2.8 percent at the time of the June su rvey.  They also revised down their growth 
forecasts for 2012 and 2013, but by considerably less.  Regarding their inflation forecasts,  
the dealers marked up slightly their forecas ts of core PCE inflation for 2011 and 2012 
and revised down their forecasts  for 2013 a little, while their forecasts of longer-term CPI 
inflation, and the reported uncertainty about those forecasts, were little changed.    
Indicators of inflation expectations were mixed over the intermeeting period.  
TIPS-based measures of inflation compensati on over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years 
ahead increased about 25 basis points, roughly reversing their declines  over the previous 
intermeeting period.  Both measures rose notab ly in late June when earlier safe-haven 
demands for nominal securities were likely re versing.  More recentl y, the release in mid-
July of a second consecutive higher-than-expected  increase in core CPI, as well as some  
technical factors, reportedly c ontributed to the rise in th ese measures.  By comparison, 
swaps-based measures of inflation compensa tion, which are much less affected by factors 
related to nominal Treasury markets, were litt le changed.  Survey measures of inflation 
expectations have generally moved down in r ecent months.  In the Michigan survey, the 
median measure of shorter-term inflation expe ctations has declined 60 basis points since 
the time of the June FOMC meeting, a nd the longer-term measure has edged down 
10 basis points on net. 
ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS   
Broad stock price indexes declined about 3 percent, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, as generally strong second-quarter earn ings reports appeared to be overshadowed 
by growing concerns about the macroeconom ic outlook.  Stock price movements were 
also influenced over the period by bouts of a nxiety regarding the fiscal situation in the 
United States and Europe.  Equity prices of  banks and other financial firms declined 
roughly as much as the broader market , and CDS premiums for larger banking 
institutions were not much changed on net.  Option-implied volat ility on the S&P 500 
index rose notably.

The staff’s estimate of the spread between the expected real equity return for the 
S&P 500 index and the real 10-year Treasur y yield—a gauge of the equity premium— 
edged up over the intermeeting period from  already substantial levels by historical 
standards.  Spreads on both BBB-rated and sp eculative-grade corporat e bonds relative to 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities  changed little, on net, although spreads on 
speculative-grade issues incr eased some late in the pe riod.  Secondary prices for 
syndicated leveraged loans were also little changed.  As noted earlier, conditions in 
commercial paper markets deteriorated for a time late in the period.  The yields on 
A2/P2-rated nonfinancial unsecured commerc ial paper and AA-rated asset-backed 
commercial paper ended the period up a bit, on net, amid the significant outflows from 
MMMFs.   
Hedge funds reported modest positive returns in the a ggregate during the 
interm
eeting period.  Nevertheless, these institutions appear to have remained quite 
cautious, further reducing leverage.  Invest ment flows to hedge funds in the second 
quarter occurred at about the same solid  pace as in the preceding quarter. 
FOREIGN  DEVELOPMENTS  
Swings in investors’ concerns about fiscal stresses in  Europe were the dominant 
driver of asset prices in foreign markets over the intermeeting period.  Sovereign spreads 
over German bunds for Greek, Irish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian sovereign debt rose 
to their highest levels since the adoption of the euro.  Mark ets were temporarily reassured 
in late June by the passage of Greek aust erity measures and again by an announcement on 
July 21 following a summit of European leader s that there would be additional official 
financing for Greece; easier terms on official  lending to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal; 
and a plan for private creditor rollovers of Gr eek debt.  However, on net over the period, 
peripheral European sovereign spreads na rrowed appreciably only for Greek debt.  
Notably, Italian and Spanish sovereign spread s have soared to almost 400 basis points 
despite approval by the Italian Parliament on July 15 of austerity measures that would 
balance the government budget by 2014.  
On balance over the period, equity prices in  the euro area dropped 9 percent, and 
euro-area bank stocks declined substantially more, as concerns about banks’ exposure to 
peripheral debt lingered and incoming economic da ta were lackluster.  Market reaction to 
the release on July 15 of the European Ba nking Authority’s stress tests of European 
banks was muted.  (See the box “Summary of the 2011 European Union–Wide Bank

Summary   of  the  2011  European  Union–Wide  Bank  Stress  Test  
One  key  factor  keeping  financial  markets  on  edge  since  the  beginning   of  the  
fiscal  crisis  in  the  euro‐area  periphery   has  been   uncertainty   about  the  underlying   
strength  of  European   banks  and  their  vulnerability   to  sovereign  default.   To  help  
allay  that  concern,  the  European   Union  (EU)  began  conducting   stress  tests  of  its  
banking  system.   Although  the  test  results  released  last  year   improved   
confidence   for  a  time,  this  confidence   unwound   as  several   Irish  banks  that  had  
passed  the  test  subsequently   required  large  government   injections   of  capital.    
On  July  15  of  this  year,  the  European   Banking  Authority   (EBA)  published   the  
results  of  its  2011  EU‐wide  stress  test.   The  results  were  drawn  from  a  test  of  
90  of  the  largest  banks,   which  hold  65  percent  of  the  total  assets  of  the  EU  
banking  sector.   Under  the  test’s  adverse  scenario,   eight  banks—five   Spanish,  
two  Greek,   and  one  Austrian—failed   to  meet  the  benchmark   of  5  percent  core  
Tier  1  capital  to  risk‐ weighted   assets.    The  aggregate  capital  shortfall  of  the  failing  
institutions   totaled  only  €2.5  billion,  a  manageable  sum  given  the  substantial   
resources   of  the  EU  as  a  whole.   
Although  market  analysts  were  surprised   by  the  relatively   low  capital  shortfall  
this  year,  the  results   do  not  appear  to  reflect  any  obvious  leniency  on  the  part  of  
the  EBA.   The  assumptions   used  in  the  stress  test,  including   those  on  
macroeconomic   performance  and  banks’  profits  and  losses,  appear  generally   
credible.   The  relatively   modest  capital  shortfall  was  due,  in  part,  to  the  
successful   efforts  of  the  banks  to  strengthen  their  capital  positions   in  the  run‐up  
to  the  test:   EU  banks  raised  €46  billion  of  capital  from  January  through  the  end  
of  April  2011.  
The  EBA  also  implemented   a  number  of  improvements   in  the  2011  test.   Banks  
were  asked  to  assess  the  effect  of  heightened   sovereign  risk  on  the  sovereign  
exposures   not  only  in  their  trading  books,  as  in  last  year’s  test,  but  also  in  their  
banking  books,  where  most  such  exposures   are  held.   Additionally,   this  year  the  
EBA  applied  a  more  stringent  capital  benchmark   of  a  5  percent  core  Tier  1  ratio  
(CT1R),  which  excludes  all  hybrid  capital  instruments   except  those   injected  by  
governments   in  response  to  the  financial  crisis.1   This  year’s  test  also  included  a  
month‐long  peer  review  by  the  EBA,  the  European   Systemic  Risk  Board,  the  
European   Central  Bank,  and  national  supervisory   authorities   that  resulted  in  
greater  consistency   of  banks’  submissions.    Finally,  the  disclosure  of  banks’  
sovereign  and  private  sector  exposures   and  components   of  bank  capital  was  
significantly   enhanced,   allowing  market  participants   to  make  their  own  
evaluations   of  banks’  capital  adequacy.   
1 The benchmark in last year’s test was a 6 percent Tier 1 capital ratio. This year’s 
benchmark is generally more stringent, despite the lower threshold, because many European 
banks include significant amounts of hybrid instruments in their Tier 1 capital.

Although  the  2011  stress  test  assumed   moderate   haircuts  on  sovereign  debt  held  
by  banks,  it  did  not  assume  an  explicit  sovereign  default.   Using  data  on  
sovereign  debt  holdings   released  by  the  EBA,  the  Board  staff  analyzed  the  
implications   of  default  on  Greek  debt,   applying  haircuts  to  the  trading  book  that  
are  double  those  considered   under  the  adverse  scenario  and  allowing  for  a  
40  percent  recovery  rate  on  holdings  in  the  banking  book.   Across  all  90  banks   
covered  by  the  stress  test,  we  estimated   about  €44  billion   in  total  losses  
assuming   such  a  default.   In  addition,  we  estimated   that  a  total  of  16  banks  
(8  banks  in  addition  to  the  8  that  failed  under  the  EBA’s  test)  would  fall  short  of  
the  5  percent  CT1R  benchmark,  resulting  in  an  additional   €25  billion  capital  
shortfall—a  material  but  manageable  sum,  we  think,  given  the  EU’s  resources.   
Most  of  the  banks  requiring  additional  capital  would  be  Greek.   No  additional  
core  European  banks  would  see  their  CT1R  fall  below  5  percent,  but  some  would  
experience  sizable  losses.   Notably,  the  four  large  French  banks  in  the  test  would  
have  total  losses  of  €7  billion,  which  is  about  4  percent  of  these  banks’  aggregate  
core  Tier  1  capital.    If  the  sovereign   debt  of  another  peripheral   country— 
especially   Italy  or  Spain—were   also  to  suffer  a  default,  bank  losses  would  be  
considerably   larger.  
As  the  above  exercise  suggests,   the  capital  positions   of  some  institutions,   while  
sufficient   for  the  benchmark,   remain
  vulnerable.    Recognizing   this  vulnerability,   
the  EBA  made  two  main  recommendations   to  further  strengthen   banks’  capital  
positions:    (1)  Banks  that  fell  below  the  5  percent  CT1R  benchmark   under  the  
adverse   scenario  should  develop  a  plan  before  mid‐October  2011  to  strengthen   
their  capital  positions   and  take  action  by  the  end  of  2011,  and  (2)  banks  that  
narrowly   exceeded   the  5  percent  CT1R  and  have  sizable  exposure   to  the  
sovereigns   under  stress  should  also  develop  a  plan  before  mid‐October  2011  to  
strengthen   their  capital  positions   and  take  action  by  April  2012.   (Sixteen  banks,  
also  concentrated   in  the  periphery,   fell  between   5  percent  and  6  percent  CT1R.)    
Although   more  capital  raising  by  EU  banks  is  needed,  the  EBA  has  no  direct  
authority   over  the  banks.   Given  that  few  banks  “failed”  the  test,  it  seems  
unlikely  that  the  test  itself  will  spur  banks  to  raise  more  capital.   It  is  left  to  
national  authorities   to  compel  banks  to  comply  with  the  EBA’s  recommendations   
and  to  establish  bank  recapitalization   facilities  at  the  national  level  that  are  
accessible   under  a  range  of  circumstances.    In  addition,  EU‐wide  mechanisms   to  
support  vulnerable  countries   in  these  recapitalization   efforts  may  be  helpful.   The  
decision  at  the  July  21  summit  has  made  the  European  Financial  Stability  Facility  
better  able  to  provide  such  support,   although  sufficient   funding  for  the  facility  to  
carry  out  its  tasks  has  yet  to  be  arranged.

Stress Test.”)  Headline equity prices for other major advanced foreign economies were 
flat to down, except in Japan, where surp risingly strong economic data boosted prices 
4 percent.  German and U.K. 10-year government bond yields declined more than 
40 basis points over the intermeeting period, re flecting concerns about the prospects for 
economic growth, related exp ectations of slower mone tary policy tightening, and 
possibly some safe-haven flows prompted by developments in peripheral Europe.   
The softer outlook for economic activity prompted market-based measures of 
expected future ECB and Bank of England policy rates to de
cline relative to their levels 
at the time of the June FOMC meeting.  In contrast, higher infla tion prompted central 
banks in the emerging market economies (EMEs) to continue  to withdraw the monetary 
stimulus that they had provided in the wake of the financial crisis.  In particular, the 
People’s Bank of China continue d to tighten monetary policy,  increasing its policy rates 
during the period another 25 basis points.  The central banks of Brazil, Colombia, India, 
Taiwan, and Thailand also tightened monetary policy over the period.  Pa rtly as a result, a 
number of EME currencies rose sharply agains t the dollar, and the governments of China, 
Brazil, and Korea took further steps to lim it capital inflows and credit growth.   
The broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar declined 
1 percent, on net, over the period.  The do llar was up 1¼ percent against the euro but 
declined against other major currencies.  Th e protracted U.S. de bt ceiling negotiations 
appeared to weigh on the dolla r for a time toward the end of the period, but the dollar 
appreciated somewhat following the announcement of  the deal to raise the debt limit.   
Demand by foreign official i nvestors for U.S. assets fell back in May and June, 
with official investors in Latin America and Asia both contributing to the decline.  These 
investors acquired Treasury securities at a sl ower pace in May and made no net purchases 
in June, and they continued to shed long- term agency securities.  Foreign private 
investors sold Treasury securities and corporat e bonds, on net, in the second quarter but 
made moderate purchases of U.S. equities.  
BUSINESS FINANCE   
Conditions in markets for business finan ce generally remained robust through the 
second quarter, but investor s’ appetite for risk appeared to  cool some in July as incoming 
data pointed to a weaker outlook for economic  activity.  The pace of net debt financing 
by nonfinancial corporations was solid in Ju ly, although a bit below its elevated second-

quarter pace.  The rate of gross bond issuance fell, as some firms reportedly were 
reluctant to issue bonds amid heightened uncertainty about prospects for economic 
growth, and C&I loans on banks’ books were ab out flat.  Nonfinancial commercial paper 
outstanding posted a sizable ga in in July, reflecting issu ance from a handful of large 
corporations.  (As noted ear lier, MMMFs pulled back from  investments in commercial 
paper in late July on concerns a bout the approaching debt limit.)  
Issuance of syndicated leveraged loans rema ined strong last quarter, reportedly 
due to continued refinancing activity, but activ ity appears to have sl owed som
e in recent 
weeks.  Indeed, investors app ear to have become more cautio us of late, requiring greater 
compensation for risk, and recent deals have embodied wider spreads and more-conservative structures, especially  for lower-rated borrowers.   
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial  firms weakened in July from its 
solid second-quarter pace, though a steady st ream of firms continued to tap equity 
markets through IPOs.  Net equity issuance is projected to have remained deeply negative 
in the second quarter, as share repurchase volumes and cash-financed merger activity continued to be robust.  Th e calendar of mergers and new repurchase programs suggests  
that net equity issuance will remain d eeply negative in the third quarter.  
With the bulk of second-quarter earnings reports in hand and private-sector 
analysts’ estimates for the rest, the staff estimates that aggregate operating earnings per share for firms in the S&P 500 index largely beat analysts’ expect ations, even though 
aggregate earnings are estimated to have falle n a bit relative to the first quarter.  The 
decline in profits was concentrated in the fina ncial sector, due in la rge part to a costly  
mortgage-related legal settlement at a large banking institution (see note 6).  In contrast, 
the earnings of nonfinancial co rporations grew at a rapid 5 percent quarterly rate, with 
nearly all of the gains account ed for by large internationally active firms.  Despite the 
strong results, analysts’ forecasts for nonfinan cial firms were not revised appreciably, 
possibly reflecting a view that the recent gains may not be sustained. 
The credit quality of nonfinancial cor porations remained solid.  The latest 
available data showed that these firms’ aggreg ate ratio of debt to assets edged down a bit 
further in the first quarter, a nd their liquid-asset ratio remain ed near its highest level in 
over 20 years.  Moody’s Investors Service’s ratings upgrades of corporate bonds of nonfinancial companies continued to outpace do wngrades substantially in July, and the 
six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial  firms inched closer to zero in June.

Commercial real estate markets remained weak, and despite a few signs of 
stabilization in the first half of the year, condi tions appeared to worsen somewhat in July.  
Available data for the second quarter indicate that commercial mortgage debt contracted 
again, prices of most commercial propert ies remained depressed, and issuance of 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMB S) slowed somewhat.  The delinquency 
rate in June for loans that back existing CMBS stayed below its recent peaks, and vacancy rates for commercial pr operties generally continued to  edge lower.  In July, 
however, investors appeared to demand more compensation for risk, and they exhibited 
some resistance to the recent decline in credit support in new deals.  Renewed uncertainty about credit rating agency criteria for rating ne w deals cast a further pall on the market.   
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE   
Residential mortgage interest rates and yields on current-coupon agency MBS 
declined, on net, over the intermeeting period and remained at low levels.  The low rates 
supported mortgage refinancing activity that was, on average, higher than that seen earlier this year, although such activity nonetheless stayed subdued because of tight 
underwriting standards and low levels of home equity.  
Residential mortgage debt is estimated to  have contracted further in the second 
quarter of 2011.  Amid a large inventory of unsold properties and tight mortgage 
underwriting standards, the CoreLogic repeat-s ales house price index fell in June for the 
13th consecutive month, reaching its lowest level since the spring of 2003.  Rates of 
serious mortgage delinquency—defined as the percentage of mortgage loans that are 
90 days past due or in foreclosure—continued to moderate but remained high, in part due 
to persistent delays in the foreclosure process.  The rate  of new delinquencies on prime 
mortgages had been declining but has flattened out in recent months at an elevated level.     
On the whole, conditions in consumer credit markets continued to gradually 
improve.  Consumer credit increased at an annual rate of 2½ percent in May, as both 
nonrevolving and revolving credit posted ga ins.  Consumer credit ABS issuance 
continued apace in July, although some deals later in the month were postponed a few 
days while issuers awaited the outcome of the debt ceiling deliberations.  Delinquency 
rates for various types of consumer debt re ceded further in recent months, with some  
rates back to levels not seen  since the recession began.  Ho wever, the decline in these 
rates partly reflects tighter unde rwriting standards that have re stricted access to credit for 
borrowers with weaker credit histories.

GOVERNMENT FINANCE   
Despite investors’ angst regarding federal fiscal conditions, the Treasury issued 
about $264 billion of nominal coupon securiti es across the maturity spectrum and 
$20 billion of TIPS during the intermeeting peri od.  The amounts issued of the nominal 
securities were consistent with past auctions , while issuance sizes of TIPS continued their 
steady expansion.  With sentiment about sovereign fiscal conditions in Europe 
improving, demand at auctions of nominal Trea sury securities in the end of June was 
lackluster, but auctions later in the intermeeting period were generally well received.  
TIPS auctions over the period reflected conti nued strong demand for in flation protection.   
Investors remained concerned about the financial health of state and local 
governments over the intermeeting period.  Alth ough issuance of municipal bonds picked 
up slightly in July, it remained sluggish by hist orical standards.  In addition, in mid-July, 
Moody’s placed the AAA credit ratings of five states on watch for downgrades, citing the 
financial vulnerability of these states to a federal government downgrade.  CDS spreads 
on the debt of these and some other AAA -rated states increased a bit over the 
intermeeting period.  Yields on long-term gene ral obligation bonds ch anged little, on net, 
and their ratios to yields on comparable -maturity Treasury se curities—a gauge of 
investors’ assessment of the relative risk  of municipal bonds—edged down but remained 
elevated.   
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND  MONEY  
Core bank loans, which include C&I, real estate, and consumer loans, were flat, 
on net, over the months of June and July, as a slowdown in lending to businesses was 
offset by a notable pickup in loans to households.5  Indeed, after running off for several 
quarters, consumer loans on banks’ books expanded solidly in June and July, as both 
credit card and other consumer loans in creased significantly.  In addition, following 
several months of contraction, closed-end reside ntial real estate loan s increased slightly 
over the period, although home equity loans continued to decline at a moderate pace.  In 
contrast, after posting sizable increases ear lier in the year, C&I loans expanded only 
modestly in June and were about  flat in July.  Commercial re al estate loans continued to 
run off.

through July 20.

The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey on Bank Lending Practices conducted in 
July indicated that banks ag ain eased lending standards to some degree on all major loan 
types other than residential real  estate loans.  Even so, in  response to a special question, 
banks indicated that the current level of their lending standards was moderate to 
relatively tight—for all loan types, at least tw o-thirds of respondents reported that their 
lending standards were at or tighter than the middle of the range that has prevailed since 
2005.  In addition, modest fractions of res pondents indicated an increase in demand for 
business loans, while reported changes in demand were mixed across consumer lending 
categories.  (See the appendix on the su rvey at the end of this section.) 
Banks shed Treasury securities, on balance,  over June and July, with the sales 
concentrated at a handful of  large dome
stic banks.  Thes e banks’ holdings are relatively 
volatile, and the activity does not appear to have  been related to conc erns about the debt 
ceiling.  Indeed, banks’ holdings of  Treasury securities rose for a time in mid-July.  In 
recent months, growth in banks’ total assets has been accounted for mainly by U.S 
branches and agencies of foreign banks, wh ich reportedly continued to build up their 
dollar cash reserves instead of sending funds to their related foreign offices abroad—a 
pattern that has prevailed fo r several months.  On the f unding side of banks’ balance 
sheets, several large domestic banks saw a subs tantial rise in deposits late in the period 
(discussed later).    
Large banking companies reported second-quart er earnings in July, and nearly all 
reports exceeded expectations at least slightly.6  Banks continued to report that 
improvements in asset quality supported subs tantial reductions in loan loss reserves, 
though weaker net interest margins offset these gains in part.  Many banks, but 
particularly the largest ones, anticipated that profitability will come under pressure in 
coming quarters from mortgage repurchasing costs, litigati on expenses, and lower debit 
fee revenues.    
M2 expanded at an average annual rate of  about 18 percent over June and July, 
the fastest pace since the period following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a marked acceleration from the 5½ percent average growth rate over the first five months of the 
6 One significant exception was the large loss re ported by Bank of America, which reached an 
$8.5 billion settlement of mortgage repurchase claims related to loans originated by its Countrywide unit.  
Following the loss, some market commentators expre ssed concern about the bank’s ability to meet Basel III 
regulatory capital requirements without raising external capital.

year.7  The rapid growth of M2 was driven by si zable increases in liquid deposits over the 
intermeeting period that were due primarily to three special factors.  First, the parent 
holding company of one large bank transferred a substantial portion of deposits it held 
abroad (and so not included in M2) to its larg e domestic bank in June, reportedly in order 
to obtain more-favorable treatment under the FDIC’s new risk-based insurance 
assessment rules.8  Second, as noted previously, invest ors reportedly rea llocated some of 
their assets out of instit utional MMMFs and into demand deposits over the period 
because of concerns about the funds’ exposures  to U.S. government debt and to European 
banks.  These investors reportedly viewed demand deposits as having a higher risk-
adjusted return in light of the unlimite d FDIC insurance currently available on 
noninterest-bearing transaction accounts.9  Third, as also noted earlier, MMMFs 
reportedly began placing substantial amount s of cash in demand deposits at their 
custodian banks at the end of July to position for the possibility of heavy redemptions in 
the event of an impasse over the debt ceiling.     
Retail MMMFs expanded in June and Ju ly, driven by growth in Treasury-only 
funds.  Small time deposits continued to run off unabated as yields on CDs remained 
extremely low.  Currency growth moderated in  June and July but remained robust.  The 
monetary base continued to expand briskly in June, supported by increases in reserve 
balances as the Open Market Desk comp leted the Committee’s $600 billion large-scale 
asset purchase program; growth in the moneta ry base dropped back in July.  (See the box 
“Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period.”)   
7 At the close of this Tealbook, Book A, deposit data used to construct the M2 monetary aggregate 
were available through July 25, and MMMF data used to construct M2 were available through July 27. 
8 This activity accounted for an estimated 4¾ per centage points of the 18 percent average annual 
growth in M2 over June and July.  This activity is not expected to affect M2 growth going forward. 
9 Effective with the July 21, 2011, repeal of Re gulation Q that was required by the Dodd–Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, financial institutions are permitted to pay interest on 
demand deposits.  The FDIC’s unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts 
does not apply to demand deposits that earn interest.

Balance  Sheet  Developments   over  the  Intermeeting  Period  
Over  the  intermeeting   period,   total  assets  of  the  Federal  Reserve  increased   $15  billion  
to  about  $2,870  billion  (see  table  on  the  facing  page).   Net  purchases  of  Treasury  
securities   associated   with  the  Federal  Reserve’s  second  large‐scale  asset  purchase  
program  (LSAP)  more  than  accounted   for  the  increase  in  total  assets.    
Since   the  most  recent  FOMC  meeting,   the  Open   Market  Desk  at  the  Federal  Reserve  
Bank  of  New  York  (FRBNY)  conducted   14  permanent  operations,   purchasing   
$43  billion  in  longer‐term  Treasury  securities.1   The  last  operation  associated   with  the  
second  LSAP  occurred   on  June  30.   Since  June  30,  the  Desk’s  0perations   have  been  
conducted   based  on  the  FOMC’s  existing  policy  of  reinvesting   principal  payments  
from  its  securities   holdings.  
Other  asset  categories   generally   declined  over  the  intermeeting   period.   Loans  
outstanding   under  the  Term  Asset‐Backed  Securities   Loan  Facility  (TALF)  decreased  
about  $1  billion  as  a  result  of  prepayments   and  principal  payments;  these  outstanding   
loans  totaled  $12  billion  at  the  end  of  the  period.   On  June  29,  the  Federal  Reserve  and  
other  central  banks  announced   an  extension  of  the  foreign  central  bank  liquidity  swap  
arrangements   from  August  1,  2011,  to  August  1,  2012.   Foreign  central  bank  liquidity  
swaps  remained  at  zero.   Finally,  the  net  portfolio  holdings  of  all  three  Maiden  Lane  
LLCs  declined,  generally   reflecting   sales  and  maturities   of  underlying   securities.   On  
June  30,  the  sales  of  Maiden  Lane  II  assets  were  suspended  due  to  the  deterioration  in  
market  conditions   for  non‐agency  RMBS.    
On  the  liability  side  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s  balance  sheet,  Federal  Reserve  notes  in  
circulation   increased   $9  billion  over  the  intermeeting   period.   The  U.S.  Treasury’s  
General  Account  balance,  which  is  highly  volatile  from  month  to  month,  declined  
$68  billion  on  net.   In  order  to  provide  greater  flexibility   in  the  conduct  of  its  debt  
management   policy,  the  Treasury  reduced  the  Supplementary   Financing   Account  
balance  from  $5  billion  to  zero.   Reserve  balances  of  depository  institutions   increased   
$23  billion,  with  the  rise  again  concentrated   at  U.S.  branches  and  agencies  of  foreign  
banks.    
The  Federal  Reserve  continued  its  program  of  conducting   regular  auctions  of  term  
deposits,  with  $5  billion  of  28‐day  term  deposits  auctioned   in  late  July.   In  addition,  on  
July  27,  the  FRBNY  announced   the  expansion  of  its  reverse  repurchase  transaction  
counterparties   to  include  Fannie  Mae  and  Freddie  Mac.   Moreover,  the  eligibility  
criteria  for  banks  and  savings  associatio ns  to  serve  as  counterparties  for  reverse  
repurchase  agreement  transactions   were  released  to  the  public  on  July  28.  
1 Over the intermeeting period, $44 billion in Treasury securities purchases settled on the 
balance sheet, and agency debt and MBS holdings declined $23 billion.

Appendix  
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey  on Bank Lending Practices  
The July Seni or Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicated that, 
on net, banks continued to ease  lending standards  and most  terms on all  types of  loans other than 
loans secured by  real estate over the  past three months.1  Modest  net  fractions of re spondents  
noted an increase in demand for  business loans over the  same period; at  the same time,  banks  
reported ly experienced, on net, slightly  weaker demand for  residential  real estate loans.2   In  
response  to a  special question, most banks  indicated that they expected  originations of  residential  
real estate  loans in the second half of 2011 to stay about the same  as  in the first  half of the year.   
Responses  to another  special question  about the level s  of lending  standards indicated  that the  
current  levels  of lending standards  were  at or  tighter  than the middle of  their  recent historical  
range  for commercial and industrial  (C&I) and commercial  real estate (CRE)  loans.  Respondents 
generally indicated  that standards were tighter  than the middle of  their  histo rical range for  
residential  real estate and consumer loans, though the reported degrees  of tightness  varied  
noticeably  across loan categories.  
Domestic banks  further  ease d standards  on C&I loans to firms of all sizes over the past  
three months. T he  net  fraction of banks reporting easing on loans to smaller firms remained  
relatively  low and below  the net  fraction reporting easing for large and middle- market  firms. 3   On  
net, domestic  banks  and branches as well as  agencies of foreign banks ( hereafter  foreign bank s)  
indicated that they had eased most terms on C&I loans  over the  survey period, and the reported 
easing was especially  pronounced for price -related  terms .  As in the past several  surveys, the 
most commonly  cited reason for  easing standards or terms on C&I loans was increased  
competition from other lenders.  As in the April survey, modest net fraction s  of  domestic and  
foreign banks reported an increase  in demand for  C&I  loans over the past  three months.  
Domes tic banks indicated that  standards on  both commercial and  residential real estate 
loans were about unchanged over the past three months.  On net, about 10 percent of respondents  
indicated that they had  eased  standards on home equity lines of credit.  The n et portion of  
domestic respondents indicating an increase in demand for CRE  loans in the current survey  
1 The July 2011 survey addressed changes in the supply of and demand for loans to businesses and 
households over the past three months. This appendix is based on responses from 55 domestic banks and 
21 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Respondent banks received the survey on or after 
July 12, 2011, and responses were due by July 26, 2011. 
2 For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction 
of banks that reported having tightened standards minus the fraction of banks that reported having eased 
standards.  For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fraction of banks that 
reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand. 
3 Large and middle -market firm s are generally defined as firms with annual sales of $50 million 
or more and small firms as those with annual sales of less than $50 million.

declined  in comparison with  the April survey, but  it  remained comfortably in positive territory .  
In contrast, small net  fractions of  respondents indicated that demand for both prime and 
nontraditional  residential  real  estate loans  as well as  for home equity lines  of credit had weakened  
or remained basically unchanged . 
With respect  to c onsumer lending, the net percentages  of banks that reported easing 
standards were low and roughly in line with the previous  survey.  While positive net  fractions of  
respondents reported ly experienced  an increase  in demand for both credit  card and auto loans  
over the past three months, the  pickup in demand was not  widespread ; moreover, demand for  
other consumer loans  was about unchanged.  
LENDING TO BUSINESSES  
Questions on Commercial and Industrial  Lending  
The net fraction of  domestic banks that  indicated  that they had eased standards on  C&I 
loans to large and middle- market firms rose slightly  to around 20 percent.  On net, f ewer  
domestic banks indicated an easing of standards on loans to smaller firms, with only about   
10 percent of respondents  noting that standards  for such firms had eased.  On balance, domestic 
banks  eased  all of the listed terms on C&I loans to large and middle- market firms, with  the most 
sizable net fractions of respondents reporting easing on price terms such  as the spread of loan  
rates over  the bank's cost of funds, the u se of interest rate floors, and  the cost of  credit lines.  
Domestic survey respondents also  indicated  some easing  of loan terms  for smaller firms, though 
the reported easing was less widespread than for  loans to larger firms.   For standards and for most  
terms on C&I loans, reported easing among domestic survey respondents was concentrated  at  
large banks.4   At foreign banks, almost all respondents  indicated that standards on C&I loans had 
remained basically unchanged, though between 5 and 35 percent of  foreign banks reported easing  
various  C&I loan  terms  on balance.  
Among  both domestic and foreign banks that  had  eased standards or terms on C&I loans, 
the most commonly cited reason for doing so was increased competition from other lenders ; this  
has been the most commonly cited reason for  easing  standards and terms since  mid-2009.  A 
number of domestic banks also pointed to a more favorable or less uncertain  economic outlook as 
an important reason  for the change in the ir  lending policies .  The reasons  that w ere  most widely  
cited by  domestic banks that reported that they had tightened C&I standards and terms over the  
past three months were  a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, and increased  
concerns about the effects of legislative changes, supervi sory actions, or changes in accounting  
standards.  
A modest net  fraction of  domestic respondents indicated that demand for C&I loans from  
large and middle- market firms had increased  over the past three months, while the net fraction 
that reported stronger l oan demand from smaller firms remained positive but  low.  Most  domestic

banks that  experienced  a strengthening of  demand cited  a shift to bank borrowing from other  
funding sources  as an  important  reason for  the change in demand, as well as to  an increase i n 
customers’ inventory financing needs.  About 15 percent of  foreign banks  reported  in  the July 
survey that demand for C&I loans had increased on net.   
A  s pecial question on the July survey  asked respondents to describe the current level of  
lending standards at  their  bank,  rather than changes in standards over the  survey period.  For  
several lending categories,  including syndicated  and nonsyndicated C&I loans, banks were asked  
to describe the current  level of standards relative to the range of  such  standards  at  their bank  
between 2005 and the present .  Weighting responses by banks’  C&I loan s outstanding, between  
45 and 70  percent of domestic respondents  indicated  that their bank’s  current  standards were near  
the middle of  that  range, though the distribution of banks’ responses varied with credit quality  
classification, syndication status, and borrower size.  For all  types of  C&I loan s, the fraction of  
banks that reported  that their current level of standards  was tighter  than the middle  of its historic al  
range was roughly similar  to the  fraction of banks that  stated standards were easier than the  
middle of  that range.  For  syndicated and nonsyndicated loans to large and middle- market firms,  
between one-fourth and one-third of  foreign banks described standards as near the middle of  their  
bank’s  recent historical  range.5   One -half of  foreign banks  characterized  their standards  for 
nonsyndicated loans  to large  and middle- market  firms  as tighter  than the middle of their historical  
range, while  the corresponding percentages among foreign banks for  syndicated loans and 
nonsyndicated loans  to small er  firms were somewhat lower.   
Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending  
For CRE lending, the net fraction of  domestic banks that reported that  standards had 
eased  over the past  three months remained positive but close to zero, about  the same as in the 
previous  two surveys.  Though few  domestic banks have  reported a  change in CRE standards 
over the past year, the July survey’s special question  revealed that  standards  for construction and 
land development (CLD) loans, nonfarm nonresidential CRE loans, and for multifamily CRE  
loans  remain  somewhat  tight relative to  their  recent historical  range .  For  all  types of CRE  loans, 
about  50 percent of respondents  on a weighted basis described the current  level  of standards at  
their bank as tighter  than the middle of the range that standards at their bank have occupied since  
2005.  Most  of  the remaining banks characterized  standards as near the middle of  that range, with  
less  than 10 percent of banks describing standards as easier  than  the middle of the range for each  
CRE loan type.   Nearly 20 percent of foreign respondents reported that their CRE lending  
standards had eased, on net , over the  past three months.  Almost all foreign  banks  that responded 
to the special  question about the level of CRE  lending standards  indicated  that the current le  vel of  
standards was at or  tighter than  the middle of  its  recent  historical range for all types of  CRE  
loans.  
5 Because of a lack of data, responses of foreign banks to special questions on C&I and CRE loans 
are reported on an unweighted basis.

On net, more than one -third of  large domestic banks described demand for  CRE loans  as  
having strengthened  over the  previous  three months, while smaller banks indicated that demand 
for such loans  had remained about unchanged on net.  At foreign banks, about  10 percent of  
respondents noted an increase in demand.  The reported  increases in  demand  for CRE loans  
occurred despite signs  of  continued distress  in CRE lending markets , including  elevated  
delinquency rates, depressed  property prices, and high vacancy rates.  
LENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS  
Questions on Residential Real Estate  Lending  
On net, banks reported  that  standards on  residential real estate l oans  were little  changed 
for both prime and nontraditional  loans.6   Similarly, only small net fraction s of banks indicated a  
change in demand for  prime and nontraditional mortgages.   
Across residential real  estate loan categories,  the fraction of banks that described their  
standards as tighter  than the middle of  their  bank’s  recent  historical  range was abo ut 90 percent or  
greater,  when weight ed  by  banks’ holdings of residential real estate loans.   For all residential real  
estate loan categories,  less than 5 percent of banks  characterized  their standards as easier than  the 
middle of their  recent  range .   
Another special question queried  banks  about whether they expected their originations of  
residential real  estate loans,  which  were  quite weak over  the first  half of 2011, to increase or  
decrease over the remainder of  the year.  About three-quarters of banks reported that  they  
expected their originations to remain at  about the same level  through the rest of  2011; t he  
remaining banks  were split between respondents that  expected an increase and  those that  
expected a decrease in  originations.   A  follow-up question asked banks that did not expect  any  
increase why they  anticipated their originations to remain  flat or to decrease.   All respondents  to 
this question cited reduced or unchanged demand from creditworthy borrowers and almost all  
responden ts  pointed to  unfavorable or uncertain  forecasts  for  the broad economy and for house  
prices.  Another common but less frequently cited reason for the lack of expected expansion in 
originations was increased  concerns about the effects of legislative changes, supervisory actions, 
or changes in  accounting standards.  
Questions on Consumer Lending  
Moderate net fractions of ba nks reported  an easing  of their lending standards on 
consumer loans over  the past three months.  For credit  card loans and for consumer loans other  
than credit card and auto loans, positive net fractions of banks reported an easing of standards, but  
these fractions were less than  10 percent .  For  auto loans, the reported easing of standards was  
more  substantial, at nearly  20 percent.  For all  three consumer loan  categories,  the net  fraction of  
large banks reporting an easing of standards was greater than  the corresponding fraction of other  
6 Three banks responded to a question that asked about changes in standards on subprime 
mortgage loans. Responses are not reported when the number of respondents is 3 or fewer.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS   
The central challenge that we confronted in putting the forecast together  was how  
to interpret the persistently disappointing pace of  economic recovery thus far this  year.  
In the baseline, we attribute the weakness to a combination of persistent demand an d 
supply influences.  In this section, we use simulations of staff models to sketch in greater  
detail several alternatives to the baseline explanation of the recent weakness that would  
result in markedly different economic outcomes over the next several  years.   In the  first  
scenario, the recent disappointing pace of recovery  reflects even -more- persistent restraint 
on aggregate demand from impaired balance sheets and other factors than is assumed in 
the baseline, implying that the economy will expand only sl ightly faster than its potential 
for several  years.  The second scenario builds on the first by recognizing the possibility  
that such a protracted period of weakness  could have adverse effects on labor supply, 
thereby restraining future growth even further.  In the third scenario, we interpret the  
recent weakness in real  activity as evidence that the supply side of the economy has  
already been damaged more than we have judged, and that there is less slack now than  
assumed in the baseline.  In the  fourth sce nario, we assume that the recent  weakness is  
largely transitory, and that the self -correcting mechanisms that helped to stabilize the  
economy during past recoveries are still operating with full force and will cause the  
economy to snap back more quickly than in the baseline.  Finally, we  consider the  
additional risk that Europe experiences  a very severe bout of financial stress and  
recession, with major spillover effects to the rest of the world.  We generate the first  four  
scenarios using the  FRB/US model and an estimated policy  rule.  The last scenario is  
generated using the multicountry SIGMA model, which uses a different policy rule  for  
the federal funds rate.1  
More-Persistent Spending Weakness  
One possible explanation for the disappointing pace of the recovery this  year is  
that balance sheet restructuring by households and businesses, financial institutions’  
1 In the FRB/US simulations, the federal funds rate follows the outcome -based rule described in 
the appendix on policy rules in Book B.  In the case of SIGMA, its rule is broadly similar but uses a 
measure of slack that is the difference between actual output and the model ’s estimate of the level of output 
that would occur in the absence of a slow adjustment in wages and prices.

adjustments to more -stringent regulations, and other demand- related factors may be 
weighing more heavily on borrowing and spending than we had antic ipated.  Similarly,  
consumer sentiment—rather than gradually improving over time, as in the  baseline—may 
be caught up in an adverse dynamic in which pessimistic households continue to restrain 
their spending, thereby holding back the pace of recovery  and s o ratifying their  
pessimism.  In this scenario, these factors restrain the growth of private spending and employment over the next several  years relative to baseline and also lead to   
less-favorable financial conditions.  In particular, the personal saving  rate gradually rises  
above 6 percent  over the  next few  years, rather than remaining r  oughly flat  at about   
5 percent; capital spending expands about 3 percentage points more slowly per  year  
relative to baseline; and poorer earnings prospects and higher risk premiums push stock prices about 10 percent below baseline by late next  year.  As a result,  real GDP  expands  
only 2½ percent in 2012 and 2013 before slowly picking up to a 3½ percent pace by  
2015.  Improvements in labor market conditions are correspondi ngly slower to emerge 
than in the baseline, and the unemployment rate is  still 8¼ percent at the end of 2013.  In  
the face of such  an anemic recovery,  core inflation gradually moves down to 1¼ percent  
and t he federal funds  rate  stays near zero  until mid -2015. 
An important reason for the modest inflation response is our assumption that  
i
nflation expectations remain well anchored.  However, if  expectations were to become 
untethered in the face  of  such a persistently weak economy, inflation would move down 
much more decisively.  
More-Persistent Spending Weakness with Supply-Side Corrosion  
In the previous scenario, future  gains in labor productivity and potential output  
are somewhat smaller than in the baseline because the slower pace of investment implies  
less capital deepening.  However, a persistently sluggish economy might also have a  
broader  corrosive  effect  on the supply side of the  economy.  For example, a protracted 
period of high unemployment might erode the skills and labor force attachment of  
unemployed workers more than in the baseline, further slowing the expansion of potential  
output.  This scenario builds on the previous one by  assuming that a slower  labor market  
recovery would cause the downward trend in labor force participation to steepen and the  
NAIRU to rise  gradually  to 6¼ percent, rather than declining a  s assumed in the baseline.  
As a result, potential GDP expands about ½ percentage point more slowly  per  year  
through 2015.  Under these conditions, the unemployment rate declines even more slow ly

than in the previous scenario and is still 8 percent  at the end of 2015.  However, the  
negative effects on labor  supply imply that the unemployment  gap closes  a  bit more  
quickly than in the previous scenario.  Accordingly, inflation is higher and is now only a  
bit below baseline.   
Greater Supply-Side Damage  
Another possible explanation for the disappointing pace of the recovery this  year  
is that the supply side of  the economy may have suffered  greater damage over the past  
several  years than  we have estimated.  For example, the NAIRU may have increased  
more due to problems related to mismatch in the labor force, trend labor force  
participation may have declined more due to poorer job market opportunities, and gains  
in structural multifactor  productivity may have been slower than we think.  In this  
scenario, we assume that  the combination of these  forces  causes the  current  output gap to 
be only  about half as large as in the baseline.  These conditions imply lower long-run 
levels of household income and corporate earnings, and hence help to explain the recent  
weakness in consumption and investment; they  also point to a more-sluggish pace of  
recovery  going forward.  Accordingly, real GDP expands about ¾ percentage point less  
rapidly per  year, on average, through 2015 than in the baseline, while inflation is higher  
because of  both the direct effects of lower productivity on firms’ costs and a smaller  
margin of slack.  Although policymakers are assumed to recognize only  gradually the  
less-favorable supply- side conditions, the stability of long-run inflation expectations  
helps to keep inflation from rising above the assumed 2 percent objective.  If inflation 
expectations were instead to drift up (perhaps on worries that policymakers were  
overestimating slack), inf lation could rise considerably more and could become a  
persistent problem.  
An important distinction between this scenario and the previous one concerns  
their contrasting implications for monetary policy.  Here, monetary policy can do little to  
offset the w eakness in real activity because so much of it is driven by supply- side factors  
impervious to policy actions.  In the previous scenario, the weakness is fundamentally  
driven by  deficient demand, especially as the corrosive labor supply  effects are a result  of 
elevated unemployment.  Accordingly, in that scenario monetary policy has much greater  
scope to improve overall welfare through stimulative actions.

Faster Snapback  
In this scenario, we consider the possibility that the adverse shocks hitting the  
economy are fundamentally transitory in nature and so will soon give way to a   
more -robust recovery.  Thus, going forward, real  activity rebounds at a pace more in line  
with that following other  deep recessions.  Real GDP rises at an annual rate  of about   
3¼ percent in the second half of this  year  and 4 percent on average in 2012 and 2013, 
boosting the demand for  labor enough to bring the unemployment rate down below   
7 percent by  mid-2013.   Initially, the stronger pace of the recovery has little effect on  
inflation because higher investment increases labor productivity (thereby holding down  
unit labor costs) and because long-run inflation expectations are well anchored.  In time, 
however, tighter labor and product markets cause inflation to move up more than in the  
baseline.   Largely i n response to stronger real activity, the federal funds rate lifts off from  
its effective lower bound by the  end of  this year.  
Very Severe Financial Stress in  Europe  
In the baseline forecast,  we project that the European economies will expand at a 
modest pace over the next two  years as financial stresses remain elevated but generally  
contained while the  global economic environment improves.  In this scenario, w e assume 
that financial difficulties  intensify markedly in Spain and  Italy, and that spillovers — 
through trade, financial, and confidence channels—are substantial to both the United 
States and the core economies of Europe.  Specifically, a  worsening in inve stor sentiment 
causes European sovereign and private borrowing costs to soar, with European corporate  
bond spreads rising 400 basis points above baseline.  European real GDP  declines about   
7 percent  relative to baseline by the second half of 2012, notwithstanding a  20 percent  
depreciation of the euro.  Financial market spillovers to the United States push  U.S. corporate spreads up about 200 basis points.  U.S. net exports are depressed by  
weaker foreign activity  and the stronger dollar.  In addition, U.S. domestic demand is  
restrained by higher borrowing costs and declining stock prices.  All told, U.S. GDP  
growth dips to zero in 2012, and the unemployment rate rises to nearly 10 percent next  
year.  The  greater resource slack, coupled with lower import pri ces, pushes core PCE  
inflation  down to ¼ percent in 2012.  The federal  funds rate remains near zero until late  
2014, five quarters longer than in the baseline.

OUTSIDE  FORECASTS  
The most recent  Blue Chip survey is  almost a month old and was collected before 
the disappointing labor  market report released in early July.  In that survey, the Blue Chip 
consensus forecast for  the  increase in real GDP  in the second half of this  year was about  
3¼ percent  at an annual rate, about ½ percentage point higher than in the current staff  
projection.  The consensus projection also expected  real GDP  to rise at a 3  percent pace  
in 2012, about the same as  the staff  projection.  Nonetheless, the Blue Chip forecast for  
the unemployment rate at the end of 2012 wa s 8.1 percent,  almost ½ percentage point  
below the staff’s projection.  Regarding inflation, the Blue Chip anticipated  that the 
overall CPI  will  increas e  3.5 percent over the four  quarters of 2011 and 2.2 percent in  
2012, forecasts that are above the staff projection  by about ½ percentage point each  year.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
