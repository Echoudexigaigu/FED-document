Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
On balance, the incoming data on house hold and business spending have been in 
line with our expectations at  the time of the previous T ealbook, and the rebound in motor 
vehicle production associated with the unwinding of suppl y chain disruptions following 
the earthquake in Japan is proceeding pretty  much as we had anticipated.  However, 
several key nonspending indica tors of near-term economic activity have come in well 
below our expectations:  in pa rticular, the disappointing perf ormance of the labor market, 
the dramatic worsening of consumer and busin ess sentiment, and the sharp drop in stock 
prices.  As a consequence, although we conti nue to anticipate that  economic activity will 
increase more rapidly in the sec ond half of this year than it di d in the first, we now expect 
real GDP to rise at an annual rate of just  2¼ percent on average ove r the third and fourth 
quarters, ½ percentage point less th an in our previous projection.  
We have also lowered our projection for economic growth in the medium term, 
consistent with the deterioration of conditions in financ ial markets over the past six 
weeks.  This deterioration, which appears to  have reflected increased concerns about 
economic prospects both in the United Stat es and abroad, has extended beyond the drop 
in equity prices; it also includes widening spreads on corporate bonds and a rise in the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar.  A proj ected lower path for cr ude oil prices should 
provide a small offset to these negatives.  After factoring everything in, we now expect 
real GDP growth in 2012 to be ½ percentage point less than in our previous forecast.  
Despite the downward revision, we still expect economic activity to accelerate 
gradually over the forecast period.  Progre ss has been made in repairing household 
balance sheets, and credit avai lability has improved over the past couple of years; against 
a backdrop of continued accommodative monetary policy, we expect these developments 
to continue throughout the projection period.  In this environment, we anticipate that 
consumer and business confidence will move up from today’s extremely low levels and 
that businesses will expand hiring and capital spending as demand strengthens.  All told, 
our forecast has real GDP increasing 2½ pe rcent in 2012 and 3½ percent in 2013.  Even 
so, resource slack remains sizable th roughout the projection period, and the 
unemployment rate is projected to sti ll be around 8 percent at the end of 2013.

The outlook for inflation is similar to th at in the August Tealbook and continues 
to be shaped by our assessment that the recent upturn in core inflation is attributable 
largely to transitory factors, most notably the pass-through of the surge in commodity and 
import prices during the first half of the y ear; with commodity prices off their recent 
peaks and import prices slowi ng, these pressures should fade in coming quarters.  Thus, 
in an environment of well-anchored l ong-run inflation exp ectations, and with 
considerable slack in labor and product markets projected to persist over the projection 
period, we expect core inflation to drop from  nearly 2 percent this year to 1½ percent in 
2012 and then to edge down to 1¼ percent in 2013.  With consumer energy prices 
expected to decline for the next few quart ers and then to hold roughly steady over the 
remainder of the forecast period, we project ove rall consumer prices to rise 1¼ percent in 
each of the next two years afte r increasing 2½ percent in 2011. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
As a result of the staff’s weaker outl ook for real GDP growth and labor market 
conditions, and with little change to our in flation forecast, we now assume that the 
FOMC will hold the target federa l funds rate in the current range of 0 to ¼ percent until 
the third quarter of 2014, f our quarters later than in the August Tealbook.  Regarding 
nonconventional monetary policy, our forecast assumes that the FOMC will announce at 
the upcoming meeting that it will extend the average maturity of the SOMA portfolio by 
purchasing $400 billion of long-te rm securities while selli ng $400 billion of securities 
with remaining maturities of three years or le ss.  We also assume the FOMC will reinvest 
principal payments from its securities holdi ngs into long-term Tr easury securities until 
the first quarter of 2014, four quarter s later than in the August Tealbook.  
Financial Conditions  
Since the time of the August Tealbook, the yield on 10-year Treasury securities 
has decreased about 65 basis points on net as market participants have marked down their expectations for the federal funds rate in the medium term, and as investors have increased their demand for low-risk assets in  light of the weaker  global economic outlook 
and an intensification of fiscal and relate d financial strains in Europe.  The 10-year 
Treasury yield was also like ly pushed down by mounting exp ectations that the FOMC 
would announce additional nonconventional monetary policy s timulus.  In response to 
these developments, we lowered our projection for the 10-year Treasury yield in the near

term significantly.  However, we continue to expect this yield to rise markedly through 
2013; this expectation reflects the movement  of the valuation window through the period 
of near-zero short-term interest rates and a waning of Federal Reserve balance sheet 
effects, as well as an unwinding of flight-t o-safety demands as the economic recovery 
gains firmer footing and European authori ties over time manage to  provide substantial 
additional support to vulnerable countries and institutions.  
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  have increased a bit since the August 
Tealbook despite the substantial declines in Treasury yields.  As  a result, spreads on 
investment-grade corporate bonds have risen to  their highest levels since late 2009.  Over 
the projection period, we expect yields on investment-grade corporate bonds to increase, 
but by less than yields on 10-year Treasury secu rities, as risk spread s narrow in response 
to slowly improving economic conditions.  Since early August, interest rates on 
conforming fixed-rate mortgages have declined about 25 basis points to around 
4¼ percent and their spreads to intermediate-t erm Treasury yields ha ve risen sharply.  
Looking ahead, yields on conforming mortgages ar e projected to rise a bit less than yields 
on medium-term Treasury securities, as mortga ge spreads are also expected to narrow. 
The Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market  Index has dropped about 6½ percent on 
net since the August Tealbook am
id weaker-t han-expected economic data as well as 
continued concerns about the global economy an d fiscal and related financial strains in 
Europe.  Although we marked down the project ed level of stock prices this round, we 
expect them to rise at an average annual  rate of about 11½ percen t through the end of 
2013.  That pace of stock pri ce appreciation would bring the equity premium down 
toward longer-run norms. 
The latest data from CoreLogic show th at existing home pr ices were little 
changed in July, in line with the projec tion in the August Tealbook.  Looking ahead, we 
expect house prices to decline slightly in the near term  before flattening out over the 
remainder of the forecast period.  The current projected level of home prices is about 
1 percent above the previous one  because of upward revisions to home prices in previous 
months. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are uncha nged.  We continue to expect federal 
fiscal policy to be a roughly neutral infl uence on aggregate demand in 2011.  In 2012 and 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook

2013, federal fiscal policy is expected to impose a drag of around 1 percent of GDP per 
year as stimulus-related policies wind down and additional fiscal restraint is imposed by the recent Budget Control Act.  Consistent w ith the act, we assume that discretionary 
spending starting in fiscal year 2012 will be su bject to caps and that additional budgetary 
restraint totaling $1.2 trillion through  fiscal 2021 will be implemented.
1  
Our forecast for the federal deficit is little  changed.  The deficit is expected to 
narrow from $1.3 trillion (8½ percent of GDP)  in fiscal 2011 to $1.1 trillion in fiscal 
2012 (7 percent of GDP) and then to around $900  billion (5¼ percent of GDP) in fiscal 
2013, reflecting both the tightening of fiscal po licy and the effects of  the recovery on tax 
receipts.  Federal debt is pr ojected to rise to almost 75 percent of GDP by the end of 
fiscal 2013, up from 36 percent at the end of fiscal 2007 at the st art of the financial crisis. 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
We continue to expect foreign economic growth to pick up this quarter after 
having been depressed in the second quarter by supply chain disrupti ons resulting from 
Japan’s earthquake and by other special factors.  However, the underlying pace of growth 
abroad appears to be slower than we j udged in the August Tealbook:  Recent data on 
foreign activity, particularly for exports and manufacturing, have come in below our expectations, and financial conditions in th e euro area have worsened as policymakers 
there continue to struggle to find a solution to the region’s fiscal stresses  and attendant 
pressures on financial institutions.  As a re sult, we now expect foreign GDP growth to 
average just 3¼ percent over the second half of 2011 and to remain at roughly that pace 
in 2012; these projections are about ¼ per centage point below those in the August 
Tealbook.  Our projection for 2013 has forei gn growth picking up to 3½ percent as 
activity in the United States quickens somewhat and as the euro-area economy  
recuperates. 
The starting point for our projected path for the broad real dollar is 3½ percent 
higher than we anticipated in the August Tealbook.  From this  higher level, the dollar is 
1 The President has proposed a set of jobs measures that total almost $450 billion; the budget cost 
of these proposals would be offset mainly through higher taxes on high-income taxpayers.  Achieving 
agreement on the package—especially on the required o ffsets—is likely to be extremely difficult.  Indeed, 
the joint committee created by the Budget Control Act is already tasked with finding at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction (even before the offsets to the jobs measures are taken into account).  Because of this 
consideration, along with the usual uncertainties in the political environment, we have not included the 
President’s proposals in our baseline forecast.

assumed to depreciate at an annual rate of almost 3 percent over the forecast period, a 
slightly faster pace than we assumed in August.  Most of the proj ected decline in the 
dollar occurs against the currencies of the emerging market economies (EMEs).  
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
The spot price of West Texas Intermed iate (WTI) crude oil has fallen about 
$5 per barrel since the time of the previ ous forecast, as concerns over the global 
economic outlook have intensified and the dollar has strengthened; on September 13, it 
closed at $90 per barrel.  We  project that the spot price of  WTI will stay around that level 
throughout the forecast period, compared with a projection of $100 per barrel at the end 
of 2012 in the August Tealbook.  Because the pr ice of WTI has fallen by more than the 
prices of other types of crude oil, we ha ve made a somewhat smaller revision to our 
projection for the price of imported oil, which is expected to drift down from  
$97 per barrel this month to $94 per barrel by the end of 2013.   
Our aggregate index for nonfuel commodity prices is down slightly since early 
August.  Metals prices have fallen mode stly, reflecting the weaker global economic 
outlook and the stronger dollar, while prices for some agricultural commodities, such as 
corn and soybeans, have moved up on concerns  about supply.  In particular, the USDA 
recently marked down its estimates of U.S. corn yields because of the extreme summer 
heat.  Consistent with our interpretation of  quotes from futures markets, we expect 
nonfuel commodity prices to remain near thei r current elevated levels over the forecast 
period. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
We continue to expect economic activity to  pick up in the current quarter as the 
drag on domestic production from the Japan-re lated disruptions to global supply chains 
unwinds.2  As noted, on balance, the incoming data on household and business spending 
have been in line with our expectations.  However, govern ment purchases are running 
lower than we had anticipated, and we have  marked down our near-term forecasts for 
private-sector spending in light  of the sharp deterioration over the intermeeting period in 
household and business sentiment.  As a result, we now expect real GDP to increase at an 
2 As in the August Tealbook, we estimate that “Jap an effects” are adding about 1 percentage point 
to real GDP growth in the current quarter after subtracting about ¾ percentage point in the second quarter. 
Effects on GDP growth rates in subsequent quarters are small.

annual rate of just 2½ percent in the current quarter and 2 percent in the fourth quarter; 
both projections are ½ percentage point below those in the August Tealbook. 
The Labor Market  
Labor market conditions deteriorated over the course of the summer.  After rising 
156,000 in July, private nonfarm employment ro se only 62,000 (after adjusting for the 
Verizon strike) in August.  In addition, th e private nonfarm workweek fell another tenth 
of an hour last month, and aggregate hours worked declined 0.2 percent.  Meanwhile, 
employment in the state and local government  sector fell 40,000 on average in July and 
August—somewhat more than in the first half of the year. 
Other labor market indicators have also been disappointing and point to only tepid 
gains in payroll employment in coming m onths; in particular, initial claims for 
unemployment insurance have risen slightly  on net in recent weeks, and help-wanted  
advertising has dropped off.  Putting this info rmation together with the softer near-term 
outlook for real GDP growth, we now project private payroll employment to rise 75,000 
on a strike-adjusted basis in September; in the fourth quarter, private employment gains 
are expected to average 100,000 per month, roughly 35,000 per month less than we had 
anticipated previously.  With  state and local governments expected to make sizable 
further cuts to payrolls in response to budget pressures, m onthly gains in total payroll 
employment over the four-month period are expected to average only about 60,000 per 
month on a strike-adjusted basis. 
The unemployment rate has been essentially  flat at a bit above 9 percent since 
May, while the labor force participation rate  has edged down to 64 percent in recent 
months.  With labor demand expected to remain  anemic in the near term, we expect the 
unemployment rate and participa tion rate to stay near these levels through the end of the 
year.  
The Industrial Sector  
After having been held down in the second quarter by supply chain disruptions 
stemming from the earthquake in Japan, manu facturing production rose ½ percent in 
July; the available information on productio n-worker hours and the weekly physical 
product data point to another moderate increas e in August.  However,  these gains are due 
mainly to the direct and upstream effects of  the post-earthquake rebound in motor vehicle 
output.  After stripping out our estimates of the effects of the ear thquake on production, 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook

the underlying pace of growth in manufacturi ng output appears to have slowed this 
quarter.  Looking ahead, assemblies of motor vehi cles are expected to step up further in 
coming months as automakers continue to repl enish low dealer inventories.  Outside of 
motor vehicles, however, the softening in the various natio nal and regional 
manufacturing surveys led us to mark down our forecast for production, and we now 
expect relatively small gains in coming mont hs.  (See the box “The Information Content 
of the Monthly Business Surveys” for furthe r discussion.)  All told, we project that 
manufacturing production will increase at an annual rate of 4½ percent on average over 
the second half of the year. 
Household Spending  
Consumer spending rose at an annual rate of just 1¼ percent in real terms over the 
first half of the year, and we expect it to  continue to increase at about this pace on 
average in the second half.  To be sure, real PCE rose ½ percent in Ju ly as sales of light 
vehicles picked up and outlays for other goods and services firmed.  However, much of 
the July gain in non-auto spending reflected transitory factors—for example, demand for 
energy services was boosted by unseasonably hot weather.  In additi on, the available data 
for August—most notably, sales of light vehi cles and the advance retail sales report— 
point to little change in r eal consumer spending last mont h.  Forward-looking indicators 
suggest that spending is like ly to remain soft in comi ng months.  The stock market 
decline pulled down household net worth, and in come growth is projected to be quite 
modest given the tepid near-term employmen t gains we are forecasting.  In addition, 
consumer sentiment plunged in August, returni ng to levels comparable to those seen in 
late 2008.  As a result, we expect real PCE to rise just 1¾ percent in the current quarter 
and 1 percent in the fourth quarter. 
In an environment of weak demand and a large inventory of vacant properties on 
the market, homebuilding has remained at a very  low level.  In the single-family sector, 
starts and permits have been essentially fl at since last summer, and home sales have 
remained moribund.  Households’ concerns abou t the prospects for jobs and incomes are 
likely continuing to weigh on housing demand, and although conventional mortgage rates 
have fallen of late, many households do not have the down payment or good credit 
history required to obtain such loans.  More over, the large stock of vacant homes for sale 
will likely channel much of any improvement in demand toward existing homes rather  
than new homes.  At the same time, limited avai lability of credit for builders is reportedly 
impeding supply in the few areas where the demand for new homes is increasing.  Given

The  Information   Content  of  the  Monthly   Business  Surveys  
Information   from  the  national  and  regional  surveys  of  activity  at  manufacturing   firms  
contributes   importantly   to  the  Board  staff’s  projections   of  near‐term  economic   activity.   
In  particular,   these   surveys  help  inform  the  projections   of  industrial   production   (IP)  and  
business  spending   on  equipment   and  software   (E&S),  and  they  are  significant   inputs  into  
the  staff’s  factor‐model  projections   of  aggregate   economic   conditions.     
The  various  manufacturing   surveys  report  similar  information.1   Each   month,  purchasing   
managers   and  other  business   executives   are  asked  to  assess  whether   several  measures   
of  business  activity—such   as  new  orders,  production,   employment,   inventories,   and  
prices—are  greater   than,  less  than,  or  the  same  as  in  the  previous  month.   Their  answers  
are  then  aggregated   into  diffusion  indexes,  which  measure  the  difference  between  the  
share  of  positive  and  negative  responses   to  each  question.    The  surveys  also  include  a  
headline  index  that  is  either  the  average  of  these  different  measures  of  activity  or  a  
diffusion  index  of  responses   to  one  subjective  question  about  business   conditions.    
The  new  orders  diffusion  indexes  from  these  surveys  correlate  well  with  near‐term  
changes  in  manufacturing   IP  (see  the  figure  below).   The  staff  has  found  that  these  
indexes  contain  predictive  power  for  manufacturing   activity  several  months  out,  even  
when  other  data—such   as  the  Census  Bureau’s  monthly  data  on  manufacturing   orders,  
motor  vehicle  production   schedules,   and  past  movements   in  IP—are  taken  into  account.    
The  new  orders  indexes  have  fallen  sharply  since  the  spring.   By  themselves,   the  levels  of  
these  indexes  suggest  manufacturing   IP  should  be  roughly  flat  in  the  coming  months.   
However,   these  indexes  occasionally   diverge  from  actual  manufacturing   production   for  
periods  lasting  at  least  several  months.   For  example,   in  2004  and  in  early  2011,  the  survey‐
based  new  orders  indexes  rose  to  elevated  levels  and  suggested   much   stronger  growth  
in  IP  than  was  ultimately   realized;  in  the  second  half  of  1998,  by  contrast,   the  new  orders  
index  from  the  national  Institute  for  Supply  Management   (ISM)  survey  predicted  
noticeably   weaker   growth  in  IP  than  actually  occurred.

One  reason  such  divergences   can  arise  is  that  diffusion  indexes  capture  the  breadth  of  
changes  but  not  their  magnitude  (we  refer  to  this  as  the  “mile  wide  and  inch  deep”  
problem):   Small  but  broad‐based   decreases  (or  increases)  in  new  orders  would  register  
as  a  sharp   drop  (or  rise)  in  a  diffusion  index  and  thus  overstate  the  weakness  (or  
strength)  in  underlying  manufacturing   activity.   Conversely,  diffusion   indexes  can  
understate  the  changes  in  IP  that  result  from  large  movements   in  a  relatively   narrow  
segment  of  manufacturing;   indeed,  we  believe  this  is  currently   the  case,  as  a  post‐
earthquake  rebound  in  motor  vehicle  assemblies   is  expected   to  materially   boost  IP  in  the  
near  term,  even  as  the  new  orders   indexes  are  tepid.   
Surveys  of  manuf acturing  conditions   are  also  useful  for  predicting   E&S  spending   for  the  
current  quarter  and  the  upcoming   quarter.    The  headline   indexes  from  the  Federal   
Reserve  Bank  of  Philadelphia’s   survey  and  the  ISM  survey  do  particularly   well;  both   
surveys  have  a  long  history,  and  the  Philadelphia  survey  is  especially   timely.   The  sharp  
downturn  in  August  in  the  Philadelphia  survey  and  the  recent  softness  in  the  ISM  survey  
point  to  a  weakening   in  business  spending   in  the  second  half  of  this  year,  part  of  which  
we  have  taken  on  board  in  the  current  staff  projection   (see  the  figure  below).     
Purchases   by  manufacturers   account  for  only  about  15  percent  of  business   investment,   so  
it  is  perhaps  surprising   that  a  manufacturing   survey  would  do  well  forecasting   overall  E&S  
spending.    One  possibility   is  that  the  manufacturing   measures  partly  reflect  the  activity  
and  confidence   of  capital  goods  producers   (who  are  themselves   manufacturers),   which  
tend  to  improve  when  E&S  spending   is  rising.   These  manufacturing   measures   might  also  
be  correlated   with  the  activity  and  sentiment  of  firms  in  the  much  larger  
nonmanufacturing   sector,  where  there  are  few  similarly  constructed   surveys  and  none  
with  a  long  history.      
Finally,  the  monthly  business   surveys  also  have  some  predictive  power  for  broader  
measures   of  economic   activity.   For  example,   the  new  orders  and  headline   indexes  from  
the  ISM  and  Philadelphia   manufacturing   surveys  are  important  contributors   to  the  staff’s   
factor  models,  which  combine  information   from  a  large  number  of  data   series  to  forecast  
near‐term  GDP  and  other   measures   of  current  economic  conditions.    In  addition,  in  simple  
regressions,  the  staff   has  found  the  nonmanufacturing  ISM  survey,  despite  its  short  
history  (it  begins  in  1997),  to  have  some  predictive  power  for  real  GDP  growth.    However,  
as  other  high‐frequency  data  become  available  (such  as  retail  sales),  the  
nonmanufacturing   ISM  data  add  little  to  forecasts   of  GDP  growth.

these factors, we expect singl e-family housing starts to be essentially flat over the second 
half of the year at an annual rate of 420,000 units, a level similar to  our projection in the 
August Tealbook.  In contrast, starts in the multif amily sector are expected to continue to 
move up as rising demand for apartments has pushed down vacancy rates and put some  
upward pressure on rents.  
Business Investment  
Real investment in equipment and software (E&S) is projected to rise at an annual 
rate of 6 percent in the current quarter as businesses continue to replace aging capital and 
resume investment projects postponed during the recession.  Although business purchases 
of transportation equipment seem to be increas ing less rapidly than they did over the first 
half of the year, the incoming data on orde rs and shipments of nondefense capital goods 
point to a solid gain in spe nding on other types of business e quipment this quarter.  That 
said, other indicators imply a somewhat softer  investment picture be fore long:  Output 
growth is sluggish, the latest readings on bus iness sentiment have been dismal, and risk 
spreads on corporate bonds have widened mark edly.  In addition, analysts’ expectations 
for earnings of producers of capital goods have generally turned softer.  Putting these pieces together, we expect the pace of grow th in real E&S outlays to slow to around 
4 percent in the fourth quarter.  
After factoring in the latest monthly c onstruction data, we estimate that real 
investment in nonresidential structures (other than those for drilling and mining) rose at 
an annual rate of 18 percent in the second quarter—the firs t widespread increase since 
2007.  However, given the ongoing restraint fr om high vacancy rates, low prices of 
commercial real estate, and difficult financ ing conditions, we do not expect the recent 
upturn to continue.  Indeed, th e architectural billings inde x, which is a useful leading 
indicator of building activity, points to a decl ine in outlays over the remainder of this 
year.  Meanwhile, investment in drilling and mining structures should continue to move 
up over the near term, boosted by the expansi on of profitable drilli ng sites made possible 
by new technologies; however, because oil pri ces have fallen somewhat, the increases we 
are projecting for the second half of the year are smaller than those realized over the first 
half. 
 Inventory investment in the motor vehicle sector seems to be picking up as auto 
dealers rebuild stocks that were drawn down by production shortfalls in the aftermath of 
the Japan earthquake.  Outside of motor ve hicles, however, we expect the pace of

accumulation to slow noticeably this quarter and next.  By most benchmarks, non-auto 
stocks appear reasonably well aligned with  sales—for example, book-value inventory-to-
sales ratios in July were close to their pre-recession norms; we assume that firms will 
adjust production as necessary in coming qua rters to forestall the emergence of stock 
imbalances.  
Government  
Real federal purchases are projected to increase at an average annual rate of 
1½ percent in the second half of  this year.  The increase is ex pected to be concentrated in 
defense spending, which was running low relative to appropriations at midyear and is expected to move into closer  alignment with those funding le vels over the course of the 
second half.  Meanwhile, state and local governments have made  large cuts in payrolls 
and reduced construction expenditures in recent  months; we expect these adjustments to 
continue over the remainder of  the year.  In all, we now project real state and local 
purchases to contract at an annual rate of 2 percent on aver age over the third and fourth 
quarters, a decline that is ½ percentage point greater than we anticipated in the August 
Tealbook.  
Foreign Trade  
  We expect the external sector to c ontribute ½ percentage point to real GDP 
growth in the second half of 2011; this contribution is a bit smaller than in the previous 
Tealbook because of the highe r dollar and weaker outlook for foreign GDP.  After 
increasing at an annual rate of just 3¾ pe rcent in the second qua rter, exports rebounded 
strongly in July; over the second half as a whol e, they are expected to rise at an annual 
rate of 9 percent, supported by the previous  depreciation of the dollar and continued 
foreign growth.  Meanwhile, despite a boost from the end of earthquake-related disruptions to automotive imports, real impor ts of goods and services are projected to 
increase at only about a 4 percent rate on average over the second half; this subdued pace 
reflects the sluggishness in U.S. economic activ ity and previous declines in the dollar. 
Prices and Wages  
Core PCE inflation picked up to an a nnual rate of 2¼ percent in the second 
quarter, and the 0.2 percent reading for this m easure in July sets th e stage for a similar 
increase in the current quarter.  We continue to think that the recent higher pace of core 
inflation largely reflects transitory factors,  including an upturn in  motor vehicle prices 
stemming from post-earthquake supply shorta ges and the pass-through of the first-half

upswing in commodity and import prices.  Accord ingly, we expect core inflation to step 
down in coming months as these transitory factors recede.  Indeed, prices of motor 
vehicles barely rose in July as supp lies improved, and the recent slackening in 
commodity and import prices points to an eas ing of pressures from these sources.  All 
told, we expect core PCE inflation to slow fr om an annual rate of about 2 percent in the 
current quarter to 1¾ percent in the fourth quarter.   
With consumer food and energy prices  running to the high side of our 
expectations
, we revised up our near-term for ecast for total PCE inflation.  However, the 
story is essentially the same  as that in the August Teal book:  Total PCE inflation is 
projected to slow from an annual rate of about 3½ percent over the first half of the year to 
1¾ percent in the second half as energy prices  turn down after their first-half surge and 
food prices decelerate in response to the leve ling off of food commodity prices over the 
past several months. 
The incoming data on labor compensation have been mixed.  The increase in 
hourly compensation in the first half of the year was revised up to an annual rate of 
4 percent, in part reflecting the BEA’s in corporation of first-quarter data from  
unemployment insurance tax records.  However,  this outsized increase appears to have 
been due, at least in part, to an elevat ed level of nonproduction bonus payments, which 
we do not expect to be repeated.  Based on monthly data for average hourly earnings 
through August and the considerab le slack in labor markets,  we expect the rate of 
increase in compensation per hour to slow to about 1½ pe rcent over the second half.  
Given our projections for compensation and pr oductivity, unit labor co sts are expected to 
edge down on net over the th ird and fourth quarters. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
Although our current projection puts economic  activity on a lower trajectory than 
we anticipated in the August Tealbook, we ha ve not gone so far as to project another 
recession (although we explore the possibility in the Risks and Uncertainty section).  Rather, we continue to think the more likel y outcome is that the pace of activity will 
gradually firm over the next two years, w ith the basic contour of the medium-term  
projection similar to our previous forecast.  One reason for this judgment is that, as best we can tell, some of the headwinds that have restrained the recovery to date have already 
begun to diminish, and we expect them to  ease further over the projection period.  
Moreover, we anticipate that  the economy’s usual self-correcting mechanisms, which

have likely been attenuated by th e severity of the recession and financial crisis, will gain 
traction over the next two years, fostered by continued accommodative monetary policy.  
Indeed, many households and businesses are in better financial shape than they were a 
couple of years ago and thus should be positi oned to raise their spending as uncertainties 
about the outlook lessen and confidence revive s; pent-up demand for consumer durables 
and business equipment should also help suppor t spending over the next couple of years.  
That said, we see little prospect of a meaningful upturn in homebuilding given the 
overhang of vacant properties and other stre sses facing the sector, and nonresidential 
construction will probably remain in the doldrums as well.  Fiscal restraint at the federal 
level and the budget problems of state and loca l governments will also likely continue to 
weigh on the outlook.  As a result, the projec ted recovery in U.S. economic activity is 
modest by historical standards, and res ource slack remains sizable throughout the 
medium term, with the level of real GDP still 4¾ percent below the level of potential 
output at the end of 2013. 
This narrative of diminishing headwinds and the em ergence of  a self-sustaining 
recovery is evident in our forecast for consum er spending.  For instance, access to credit 
has improved, the declines in home prices—if our forecast is correct—should be largely 
behind us, and households in the aggregate curr ently face lower debt service burdens than 
they did earlier.  In addition, we assume that consumer sentiment will move up somewhat 
as the economic recovery proceeds.  After f actoring in these considerations, along with 
some pent-up demand for motor vehicles and ot her durables, we expect growth in real 
PCE to pick up to 2¼ percent in 2012 and to 3 percent in 2013.  The personal saving rate 
is expected to hover around 5½ percent thr ough the projection period, a little above its 
average for the first half of 2011. 
In the business sector, firms generally seem well positioned to step up their capital 
expenditures once sales prospects improve and uncertainty lessens.  Many corporations 
are flush with cash, and those with access to capital markets should not find it difficult to 
obtain financing at favorable terms; in addition, we expect credit availability for 
businesses more dependent on bank financing to improve.  That said, it will likely take some time for firms to become confid ent enough about the economic outlook to 
undertake more substantial increases in their productive capacity.  As a result, we expect growth in real E&S outlays to average only 4 pe rcent at an annual rate  over the first half 
of 2012 before moving up to 6½ percent in  the second half of 2012 and in 2013.

However, even with this faster rate of E&S growth, the resulting level of net investment 
implies only a modest further ri se in the E&S capital stock.  
Although we revised down our forecast for U.S. exports because of the higher 
assum
ed path for the dollar and a weaker fo reign outlook, we still expect exports to 
provide substantial support to domestic pr oduction over the medium term.  Indeed, 
spurred by robust growth in the EMEs and th e effect of past and prospective dollar 
depreciation, real exports ar e projected to increase 7¼ per cent per year in 2012 and 2013.  
Real imports are projected to increase just  3½ percent in 2012, held back by sluggish 
activity in the United States and dollar depr eciation; they accelerate a bit in 2013 in 
response to the faster pace of U.S. activit y.  Given these projections, we expect net 
exports to contribute ½ pe rcentage point to U.S. real GDP growth in 2012 and 
¼ percentage point in 2013. 
In contrast, the constructi on sector is not likely to provide much impetus to 
growth over the next two year s.  Although the declines in house prices are projected to 
taper off and prospects for jobs and income s to improve, many households will likely 
continue to find it difficult to finance ho me purchases, and the drag on homebuilding 
from the overhang of vacant homes will probably lessen only slowly.  Thus, we project 
just a gradual resuscitation of new cons truction, with single-family housing starts 
reaching an annual rate of 490,000 units by the end of 2012 and 570,000 units by the end 
of 2013—150,000 units higher than recent readin gs but still far below the pace we 
believe is consistent with the longer-run demand for housing.  Nonresidential 
construction is likely to remain depressed as  well, constrained by hi gh vacancy rates, low 
prices for commercial real estate, and lending conditions that will likely be tight for some 
time. 
Finally, given our fiscal a ssumptions, we expect the government sector to be a 
drag on economic growth over the medium term.  At the federal level, real purchases are 
projected to decline almost 1 percent in  2012 and 4 percent in 2013, as discretionary 
appropriations become subject to the caps imposed by the Budget Control Act and as 
outlays related to overseas military operations  begin to wind down.  Budgets at the state 
and local level are also exp ected to remain extremely tight over the medium term as 
stimulus-related federal payments are phase d out, nonstimulus grants are held down by 
the restraints on federal spending, and incr eases in tax receipts are limited by the

local purchases to fall anothe r ½ percent in 2012 and to rise  less than 1 percent in 2013. 
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR  MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU  
We have made no material changes in this  Tealbook to our estimates of aggregate 
supply in 2011 and 2012 and continue to estimate that potential GDP will increase about 
2 percent in each year.  Our projection ha s growth in potential output edging up to 
2¼ percent in 2013, mainly because a faster pa ce of capital deepening is expected to 
boost structural labor productivity.  We assume  that the NAIRU will remain at 6 percent 
through 2013.3   
Productivity and the Labor Market 
After having fallen slightly over the first half of the y ear, labor productivity seems 
likely to post a solid increase in the current quarter, putting its level somewhat above our 
estimate of the level of its structural tre nd.  We expect the gap between actual labor 
productivity and its structural level to na rrow over the next few quarters as firms add 
workers to meet rising production needs.  Ther eafter, productivity growth is expected to 
settle at an annual rate of about 1¾ percen t, roughly in line with its trend rate. 
The trajectory of employment largely re flects the acceleration in real GDP.  In 
particular, we expect private job gains to  average 170,000 per month in 2012 and to pick 
up to 220,000 per month in 2013.  In the state and local sector, job cuts are anticipated to 
lessen next year and be followed by small increases in 2013 as budget pressures ease a 
bit.  
Reflecting the downward revision to our forecast for output growth, the projected 
gains in employment in 2012 are somewhat sma ller than those in the August Tealbook.  
As a result, the unemployment rate is expected to still be in the area of 8¾ percent at the 
end of next year, ¼ percentage point above our  previous forecast; this projection implies 
little improvement in joblessness next year ap art from that attributable to the phasing out 
3 Our estimate of the “effective” NAIRU, which includes the influence of extended and emergency 
unemployment benefits and is the level of the unemploymen t rate that we view as being consistent with no 
slack in resource utilization, is unrevised from the Augu st projection and is about 6½ percent at present.  
We expect the gap between the effective NAIRU and th e traditional NAIRU to essentially disappear by the 
end of 2012 when the extended and emergency unemployment benefit programs wind down.

of extended and emergency unemployment benef its.  The unemployment rate is expected 
to decrease somewhat over the course of 2013 as the GDP gap narrows and job gains pick 
up, ending the year at about 8 percent. 
Resource Utilization 
We estimate the amount of economic slack to be sizable at presen t and expect it to 
remain so over the next 2½ years; in particular , the level of real GDP is projected to still 
be 5¾ percent below the level of potentia l output at the end of 2012 and 4¾ percent 
below potential at the end of  2013.  Similarly, by our reckoning, the unemployment rate 
will be 2 percentage points above the effective NAIRU at the end of 2013, compared with 
an estimated unemployment gap of 2½ percenta ge points in the current quarter.  This 
extended period of labor market slack is likely to be associated with other features of a 
weak labor market, including below-trend labor force participation, a high percentage of 
workers who are involuntarily on part- time schedules, and an unusually large 
concentration of workers experiencing long-duration unemployment spells. 
The margin of unused plant capacity in the industrial sector should be taken up 
more rapidly than the slack in the economy as a whole, in part because manufacturing 
capacity is projected to rise just 1 percen t in 2012 and 1½ percent in 2013, considerably 
below the rate of increase in potential GDP.  As a result, at the end of 2013, our 
projection calls for the factory operating rate to be around it s long-run average despite the 
still-sizable GDP gap prevailing at that time. 
Compensation and Prices 
Given the appreciable amount of labor market  slack persisting in our forecast, as 
well as the low rates of price inflation, we expect labor costs to remain subdued over the 
projection period.  In particular, both th e Productivity and Cost measure of nonfarm  
hourly compensation and the employment cost  index are projected to rise about 
2¼ percent per year in 2012 and 2013.  Co mbined with the moderate gains in 
productivity that we project, these increases in compensation imply only a small rise in 
unit labor costs. 
Prices for imported core goods (all goods  excluding fuels, computers, and 
semiconductors) are projected to rise at an  annual rate of 2¾ pe rcent in the current 
quarter, a notable deceleration from the 7½ pe rcent rate of increase recorded in the 
second quarter, as the effect of the run-up in non-fuel commodity prices that occurred

earlier this year fades.  Over the remai nder of the projection pe riod, core import price 
inflation is expected to run at about a 1½ percent pace as commodity prices remain 
relatively flat and the dollar depreciates only modestly.   
Recent readings on inflation expectations have been m ixed but generally suggest 
that long-run expectations have remained st able.  Median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation 
expectations from the Michigan survey for August stood at 2.9 percent, the same as in 
July and within the narrow range that has pr evailed over the past couple of years.  
Similarly, in the third-quarter reading from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, 
median expectations of PCE inflation over the next 10 years were 2.3 percent, the same  
as in the second quarter.  In contrast, th e TIPS-based measure of five-year inflation 
compensation has fallen nearly ½ percenta ge point since the time of the August 
Tealbook, and the five-year-forward measure has fallen a similar amount; however, much 
of the decline likely reflects safe-haven  flows into nominal Treasury securities.  
As in the August Tealbook, the contour of  our medium-term projection for core 
inflation reflects the anticipated fading of the transitory pressures that have boosted 
inflation this year.  We also continue to a ssume that inflation expectations will remain 
stable and that the unemployment rate gap w ill narrow only slightly.  As a result, with 
pressures from commodity and im port prices diminishing, core  inflation is expected to 
drop from nearly 2 percent this year to 1½ pe rcent in 2012 and to decrease a bit further, 
to 1¼ percent, in 2013.  This slowing in core inflation occurs despite a modest expected 
increase in its rental component.  (See the box “Rents and Inflation” for further 
discussion.)  Given the anticipated paths for food and energy prices, to tal PCE inflation is 
expected to be a little below core infla tion in 2012 and in line  with core in 2013.  
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2016 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assessments of long-run supply- side conditions, fisc al policy, and other factors.  The 
contour of the long-run outlook depe nds on the following key assumptions: 
  Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long run, 
consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections provided by 
FOMC participants at the June meeting.

Rents  and  Inflation   
Rental  markets  have  tightened   over  the  past  year,  as  shown  in  the  lower‐ left  figure  by  the  declines  in  
several  measures   of  rental  vacancy  rates.   Over   the  same  period,   rental  inflation  (the  black  line  in  the  
lower‐ right  figure,  which  includes  owners’  equivalent   rent  as  well  as  tenants’  rent)  has  picked   up  to  a  rate  
of  1¼  percent  in  the  first  half  of  this  year,  and  it  appears  to  have  stepped  up  to  above  2  percent  in  the  
current  quarter.  
Our  models—which  relate  PCE  rental  inflation  to  the  Census  vacancy  rate  as  well  as  to  its  own  lags,  
changes  in  utilities  prices,  the  unemployment   rate,  and  measures   of  housing  affordability—have  tracked  
actual  rental  inflation  reasonably   well  in  recent  quarters.   In  particular,   as  shown  by  the  solid  red  line  in  
the  lower‐ right  figure,  a  simulation   from  one  of  our  models  starting  in  2006  captures  the  upturn  in  actual  
rental  price  inflation  quite  well.   Over  the  projection   period,  this  simulation   projects  rental  inflation   close  
to  2  percent,  as  does  the  Board  staff   forecast.  
Of  course,  the  projection   from  the  model  simulation   depends  on  our  forecasts   of  the  model  
determinants—in  particular,   the  vacancy  rate.   Based  on  lags  of  the  unemployment   rate,  multifamily   
housing  starts,  and  rental  inflation,   we  project  the  vacancy  rate  to  remain  near  current  levels  over  the  
medium  term.   However,  if  rental  demand  proves  much  stronger  than  anticipated,  vacancy  rates  likely  
would  fall  more  sharply  and  rents  would  increase  more  than  we  project.    For  instance,   if  the  Census  
vacancy  rate  were  to  fall  to  8  percent  in  early  2012  (the  dotted  line  in  the  lower‐ left  figure),  a  rate  last  
seen  in  the  mid‐1980s,  the  model  predicts  that  rental   inflation   would  move  up  to  3  percent   by  the  end  of  
next  year  (the  dotted  line  in  the  lower‐ right  figure),  ¾  percentage  point  higher  than  the  Tealbook   
projection.    Still,  because  rents  constitute   only  about   18  percent  of  the  core  PCE  price  index,  an  increase  
of  this  magnitude  would  add,  all  else  being  equal,  only  a  little  more  than  0.1  percentage  point  to  core  PCE  
inflation  in  2012.   (The  effect  on  the  core  CPI  would  be  about  twice  as  large,  reflecting   the  larger  weight  of  
housing  in  the  CPI.)

  The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities f ollow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B.  The projected longer-run decline in the 
System’s holdings is forecast to contribut e about 30 basis points to the rise in 
the 10-year Treasury yi eld from 2013 to 2016. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds decline gradually to normal levels, and banks ease their lendi ng standards somewhat further. 
  The federal government budget deficit (N IPA basis) narrows from 5¼ percent 
of GDP in 2013 to 3¾ percent of GDP in 2016.  This narrowing reflects both 
the effects of the economic recovery on tax receipts and budgetary restraint 
consistent with the recently  enacted Budget Control Act. 
  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to depreciate 
1½ percent per year from 2014 to 2016.  Th e price of WTI crude oil is roughly 
flat at around $95 per barrel during th e extension period, consistent with 
futures prices adjusted for divergences between staff and market expectations 
for economic activity and exchange ra tes.  Foreign real GDP expands, on 
average, 3½ percent per year from 2 014 through 2016, slightly above its trend 
rate.  
  The NAIRU declines from 6 percent in  late 2013 to 5¼ percent in late 2016 
as the functioning of the labor market  gradually improves.  Potential GDP 
expands 2½ percent per year on average from 2014 to 2016. 
The economy enters 2014 with  output still considerably  below its potential, the 
unemployment rate well above the projected NAIRU, and inflation below the assumed 
objective.  In the long-run forecast, improvi ng confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and 
supportive financial conditions enable real GDP to rise at an average annual rate of 
almost 4 percent from 2014 to 2016.  With actual output expanding appreciably faster 
than potential, labor market  conditions improve consider ably.  Nevertheless, the 
unemployment rate does not fall below 6 per cent until late 2016, when it still stands 
about ¾ percentage point above  the assumed NAIRU.  With  downward pressures from  
slack on unit labor costs gradually abating after 2013, inflation e dges up to 1.6 percent by 
2016.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Our  forecast  for the foreign economies is one of continuing recovery  but with less  
vigor and  more  uncertainty than we foresaw in August.  The inability of European 
policymakers to get ahead of the ongoing f  iscal and banking turmoil has raised the odds  
of a severe financial crisis.  In our baseline outlook, the euro area avoid s  such an extreme 
outcome, but intensified financial stresses  and i ncreased pressure for  fiscal  austerity have 
led us to mark down our  projections for  euro -area growth.   And even this  lackluster  
outcome  will require  that  European authoriti es provide substantial additional support to 
vulnerable countries  and institutions.   With the  situation in Europe evolving rapidly, we 
see a substantial risk  that  the outlook could deteriorate sharply.  
In  other foreign economies, r ecent data on  activity have also suggested  a 
somewhat slower pace of expansion  than we had anticipated .  Canadian real  GDP  
unexpectedly  contracted in the second quarter because of a notable fall in exports.  F or 
many emerging market economies  (EMEs) , the recent softness also has been  
concentrated in the external sector —likely reflecting  less demand from Europe and the 
United States —and raises concerns  that domestic  demand will begin to stumble as well, 
especially  in  the more export-dependent economies.   
We now expect aggregate foreign real GDP  growth to pick up to 3½ percent in 
the current quarter from the meager 2¼ percent  second- quarter pace, largely  reflecting  
the unwinding of supply  chain disruptions caused by the Japanese earthquake.  As these  
effects wear off,  GDP  growth should step back down to 3 percent later this year and then  
move up to 3½ percent  by  2013, a s private demand strengthens, the pace of  U.S. 
economic activity  picks up, and the euro -area economy improves.   Compared with the  
August projection, we marked down our  foreign growth projection ¼ percentage point in 
the second half of this  year and in 2012.   
We estimate that inflation in the advanced foreign economies ( AFEs )  is falling  to 
an annual rate of  ¾ percent in the third quarter, down from 2 percent in the  second 
quarter.  This decline  is partly the  result of the recent drop in oil and othe r commodity  
prices .  With resource slack in the AFEs  dwindl ing only slowly, inflation should remain 
subdued at around 1¼ percent over the remainder  of the forecast period.  I nflation in the  
EMEs  is running higher than in the AFEs, at an estimated 4½ percent in the current

quarter, but  has also  moved down since early this year  with  the decline in commodity  
prices  and is projected to  average 3¼ percent during 2012 and 2013.  With diminishing  
inflationary pressures  and a less favorable  growth outlook, we  expect monetary policy  
abroad to be  more accommodative than in the previous Tealbook. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN  ECONOMIES  
Real  GDP growth in the  AFEs  stalled  in the second quarter following a  
2¼ percent  expansion in the previous quarter.  The slowdown was more pronounced than 
anticipated in the August Tealbook, mainly  in Canada and the  euro area.  Indicators for 
the third quarter have been on the soft side, with recent readings of the manufacturin g 
PMIs in Europe  falling into contractionary territory  for the first time  since mid -2009.  
That said, with  supply chain disruptions resulting f  rom the Japanese earthquake  largely  
resolved and as other temporary factors abate, AFE growth should rebound to 2¼ percent  
in the current quarter.   
Going forward, AFE  growth is projected to languish below 2 percent through 
2012 before picking up to 2¼ percent in 2013.  This  forecast  is lower than  that in the  
previous Tealbook, reflecting  a bleaker assessment of the euro -area debt crisis, negative 
wealth effects from the significant drop in global equity prices, and the weaker U.S. 
outlook.  Although we have stopped shy of projecting outright recession in the euro area, 
we now expect that heightened financial tensions in the region will weigh on growth for longer than previously anticipated. 
We project that AFE inflation will fall from 2 percent in the second quarter to  
¾ percent  in the third quarter, owing  in part to declines  in energy  prices .  Over the rest of  
the forecast period, we expect inflation to hover around 1¼ percent  amid persistent 
resource slack.   Given the weaker  growth outlook and increased downside  risks, we now  
anticipate that all major foreign  central banks  will keep policy rates on hold until 2013.   
Euro Area  
The fiscal  and financial turmoil  in the euro area has  intensified  further.  T he risk  
of a disorderly  Greek default has risen , and market participants  have become increasingly  
doubtful about the ability of policymakers to contain the spread of the  region’s  debt  
crisis.   Although w e expect financial conditions to remain strained  for quite  some time,  
we continue to assume— albeit with diminishing confidence —that European 
policymakers will avert a major  financial  crisis.   For this  relatively  benign scenario to 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook

materialize,  however, policymakers must implement the measures  agreed to at  their  
July  21 summit (see the  box “Recent Policy Developments in the Euro A rea”).  Even  
with these actions , there is a significant risk  that Greece will experience a disorderly  
default as its failure to meet its fiscal targets is putting official financing disbursements in  
jeopardy and as  private- sector interest in its  voluntary  restructuring plan is  falling short of  
expectations.   Accordingly, policymakers also need to take further actions  to provide a  
credibl e backstop for Italy  and Spain  as well as  the entire region’s banks, perhaps through 
a considerable expansion of the European Financial Stabili ty Facility .  In  any case , the 
ECB  will have to play a central role in  preserv ing financial stability in the  euro area , such 
as through purchases of  sovereign bonds and provision of liquidity to banks. 
In part because of the difficult  financial conditions, real GDP  grew a meager  
0.6 percent  in the second quarter, nearly 1 percentage point below our expectations, as  
private consumption contracted for the first time  since mid -2009.  France and Germany  
saw their  growth  come to a halt , part ly reflecting a  step-down from a  rapid first -quarter  
pace.  For the  current quarter, data point to continued weak growth:   In  August, t he 
manufacturing PMI fell below 50 for the  first time in two years, business confidence  
declined  further, and consumer confidence plummeted.  In addition, funding pressures for  
some euro -area banks are likely restraining  credit availability.   Against this backdrop of  
disappointing economic indicators, elevated financial stress, and tight fiscal policy, we  
marked down the  euro-area  growth outlook almost ½ percentage point.  We  now expect  
GDP growth to remain around ¾ percent in the second half of 2011, to barely  break 
1 percent in 2012, and then to rise to a modest 1¾ percent by 2013.   
Euro -area inflation  is projected to fall from 2¾ percent in the second quarter to 
less than 1 percent in the third quarter, largely reflecting the decline in  energy prices .  
Amid persistent resource slack, we expect inflation to  remain around 1½ percent  in 2012 
and 2013.  This forecast is  a touch lower in 2012 than in the August Tealbook.  At its  
September  meeting, the  ECB kept its main policy rate unchanged  but signaled that  
downside risks to economic growth had increased and that inflation risks had eased 
somewhat.  Given the weaker outlook for  growth and inflation, we no longer  expect the 
ECB to  raise its policy rate  over the forecast period . 
Japan  
Real  GDP declined 2.1 percent in the second quarter  amid  the devastation 
wrought by the March earthquake and tsunami.  This outturn is ¾ percentage point

Recent  Policy  Developments   in  the  Euro  Area  
In  response  to  the  ongoing  European   fiscal  crisis,  euro‐area  leaders  agreed  on  
July  21  to  significantly   increase  financing   for  Greece—conditional   on  some  
voluntary   restructuring   of  private‐sector  debt—and   to  increase  the  scope  and  
flexibility   of  the  European   Financial  Stability  Facility  (EFSF),  the  financial  backstop   
for  the  euro  area.   Unfortunately,   progress  on  implementing   these   measures   has  
lagged,  Greece  is  scheduled   to  run  out  of  cash  shortly  without  another  
disbursement   by  the  European   Union  (EU)  and  the  International  Monetary   Fund  
(IMF),  and  financial  conditions   for  European   sovereigns   and  banks  have  
worsened   dramatically.    As  a  result,  the  European  Central   Bank  (ECB)  has  had  to  
take  a  more  active  role  in  supporting   sovereign  debt  markets  and  providing   
liquidity  to  European   banks.    
Beginning   with   Greece,  delays   in  disbursing   funds  under  the  existing  aid  program  
and  in  negotiating   a  new  rescue  package   have  pushed  the  probability   of  
disorderly  default  uncomfortably   high  and  have  sent  Greek  sovereign  spreads  
soaring  (see  lower‐ left  figure  on  facing  page).    
The  delays  reflect  three   key  stumbling   block s.   First,  the  Greek  government   is  
falling  well  short  of  this  year’s  fiscal  targets,  reflecting   poor  implementation   of  
agreed  reforms  and  a  deeper‐than ‐expected   recession.    As  a  precondition   for  the  
next  disbursement   and  any  new  assistance,   European   leaders  and  the  IMF  are  
seeking  much  stronger  execution   of  existing  commitments   as  well  as  additional   
austerity  measures.    However,   the  Greek  government   has  reportedly   been  
reluctant   to  undertake  additional   consolidation.    As  a  result,  negotiations   
between   Greece,  the  EU,  and  the  IMF  were  suspended   in  early  September.    
Subsequently,   the  Greek  government  announced   plans  to  revive  key  reforms,  
levy  a  special   tax  on  real  estate,  cut  public  wages,  and  accelerate   approval  of  the  
2012  budget.   It  is  not  yet  clear  whether  these  steps  will  suffice;  negotiations   are  
expected   to  resume  in  mid‐ September.  
Second,  several  smaller   euro‐area  members,  particularly   Finland,  are  requiring   
collateral   to  secure  any  new  commitments   to  Greece,  a  demand  that  is  opposed  
by  other  countries   and  the  IMF.   Despite  weeks  of  discussions,   euro‐area  officials  
have  yet  to  reach  a  compromise  that  would  allow  negotiations   on  a  new  Greek  
aid  package  to  proceed.  
Third,  it  appears  that  private  creditor  participation   in  the  proposed   debt  
restructuring   will  fall  short  of  its  90  percent  target.   Such  a  shortfall  would  likely  
force  the  EU  and  the  IMF  to  choose  between  providing   even  more  official  
financing   or  moving  toward   a  more  coercive  restructuring.   Uncertainty   over  the  
success  of  this  debt  exchange  is  unlikely  to  be  resolved  before  October.

The precarious situation in Greece has made the need for a euro-area financial 
backstop to stem contagion to other vulnerable economies all the more crucial. 
However, efforts on this score have also fallen short. This month, euro-area 
parliaments were expected to ratify both the July agreement making the EFSF 
more flexible and a March agreement increasing its effective lending capacity to 
€440 billion. But the timetable for passage may slip because of pockets of 
resistance in various countries. In addition, although Germany’s Constitutional 
Court recently approved Germany’s participation in the EFSF, it required that the 
government obtain parliamentary approval for future commitments, reducing 
the potential effectiveness of the EFSF. The court also ruled out German 
participation in some other types of support, such as Eurobonds. Finally, and 
most worrisome, many observers now believe that, even with the proposed 
changes, the EFSF would be too small to serve as the primary backstop for Italy 
and Spain.
Page 39 of 102
Int'l Econ Devel & OutlookIndeed, the lack of an effective backstop has led to an intensification of financial 
market stresses, notably for Italy and Spain (see lower-left figure) and for euro- 
area banks. In response, the ECB re-activated its Securities Markets Programme 
to buy Italian and Spanish government debt as well as that of Greece, Ireland, 
and Portugal. The ECB partly conditioned this action on greater commitment to 
fiscal discipline by the Italian and Spanish governments. Since restarting 
purchases in early August, the ECB has bought about €70 billion through the 
week of September 9  (see lower-right figure). In addition, the ECB has 
significantly increased liquidity to euro-area banks through its repurchase 
facilities and by extending its fixed-rate tenders to the end of 2011. Italian and 
Spanish 10-year sovereign spreads initially dropped almost 125 basis points but 
have recently retraced much of these declines, and conditions for banks continue 
to worsen, indicating that more dramatic policy measures by euro-area leaders 
will likely be needed to resolve the fiscal crisis.

stronger than we estimated in the August Tealbook, as the supply- side constraints caused  
by the  disaster  were resolved faster than we had anticipated .  Indeed, by July, industrial  
production had recovered most of its losses.  Other indicators, by  contrast, have been 
somewhat  disappointing :  Real exports and consumption spending stalled in July, and the  
composite  PMI fell  in August.  The less -than-expected decline in second -quarter output  
combined with sluggish incoming data have led us to revise down our  estimates for the  
bounceback in growth in the second half of this  year to 4 percent.   Thereafter , we see 
growth slowing to 2¼ percent in 2012 and to 1½ percent  in 2013.  This outlook is weaker  
than that in the August Tealbook, given the markdown to global  growth and the sharp 
decline in equity prices.  
On  S eptember 2, Yoshihiko Noda  became Japan’s  new prime minister, replacing  
Naoto Kan , who  came under attack  for his  government’s handling of the nuclear  accident  
at the Fukushima power  plant.  We do not expect the new  government to change  fiscal 
policy , which is expected  to add nearly 1 percentage point to growth this  year before  
graduall y turning contractionary over the remainder of the forecast period.  
Statistical revisions to the  CPI lowered second- quarter  inflation ½  percentage  
point to negative ¾ percent.  However, led by  a surge in  food prices, the new CPI rose  
sharply in July, prompting  us to raise our forecast  of th ird-quarter inflation to nearly  
1 percent .  As  food price inflation moderates , we expect  deflation to  resume over the rest  
of the forecast period.  We do not expect the Bank of Japan to change its policy rate or  
the size of its asset purchase program  through 2013. 
Canada  
Contrary to our expectations for a small increase,  Canadian  real GDP declined  
0.4 percent in the second quarter  because of  a drop i n exports related  in part to production 
disruptions at automobile plants and temporary shutdowns at oil extraction sites.  In  
contrast, final domestic demand expanded briskly, led by investment spending.   We 
expect GDP growth to  pick up to 2¾ percent in the third quarter, as  production of  
automobiles and oil recovers.  GDP  growth is then projected to hover around 2 percent  
through 2012 before  rising  to about 2½ percent by  the end of the forecast period.  
Relative to the August Tealbook, our forecast is down ¼ percentage point in the second half of this  year  and in 2012 due to weaker external demand and lower  equity  prices.  
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
September 14, 2011
Page 40 of 102
Authorized for Public Release
Automobile price discounts and t he decline  in oil prices  likely depressed  inflation  
to just ¼ percent in the third quarter.  Over the remainder of the  forecast period, we  
expect i nflation to average just under 2 percent,  which is  consistent with the stabilization  
of commodity prices and moderate resource slack.  With inflation in check and a further  
weakening of  external demand, we now e xpect the B ank of Canada to hold its  target for 
the overnight rate  at 1 percent through early 2013.  
United Kingdom  
Second -quarter GDP  growth was a meager 0.7 percent, held down in part  by the  
Royal Wedding holiday  and parts shortages at automobile plants.  With  these temporary  
factors  revers ing, we estimate real  GDP  will expand 2¼ percent in the  current quarter.  
But recent data have been soft:  U nemployment claims  rose  through July, and the  
composite PMI dropped  in August  to a level consistent with  very li ttle growth .  Given 
these weak  indicators, the recent fall in equity prices, and the bleaker  euro -area outlook, 
we trimmed our GDP  growth forecast ½ percentage point  for the second half of this  year  
and a few tenths of a percentage point  next year .  We now  expect GDP growth to average 
2 percent through the end of 2012 and 2½ percent  in 2013, leaving output  well below  
potential. 
Despite the fall in oil prices, we expect quarterly  inflation to average 3 percent  in 
the near term , as utility companies hike  tariffs.  Although current  inflation  is elevated , 
measures of medium - to long- term inflation expectations  have declined,  and we forecast  
that inflation will s  low to  nearly  2 percent  by 2013, weighed  down by considerable  
resource slack.   In light of  the  softer GDP  outlook, we  delayed the first policy  rate hike to  
the second half of 2013 and see a greater chance that the Bank of England  will expand its  
asset purchase  program .  
EMERGING MARKET  ECONOMIES  
Economic activity  in the  emerging market economies  rose at an  annual pace of  
4½ percent in the second quarter, a  little stronger than in  our August projection.  In the  
current quarter,  we expect  EME growth to edge up, in part reflecting some  bounceback 
from the effects of the Japanese earthquake.  However, recent readings on industrial  
production, exports, and manufacturing PMIs reinforce our view that the  underlying pace 
of growth is slowing in the EMEs, and we  expect some deceleration of activity in the 
next couple of quarters.  By the end of 2013, growth should ret urn to nearly 5  percent , 
supported by  the projected recovery in the advanced economies.  Relative to the August  
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
September 14, 2011
Page 41 of 102
Authorized for Public Release
Tealbook, our  growth projection is marked down ¼ percentage point for the second half  
of this  year and for 2012, as the softer tone of the incom ing EME data and  the weaker  
U.S. outlook suggest more  weakness in external demand than we anticipated .  A key 
downside  risk to this forecast is th at  softer exports induce a much more pronounced 
slowdown in domestic demand . 
Even though headline inflation in EMEs  has moved down relative to the levels  
seen early this  year, we estimate that i n the current quarter  it  edges up to an  annual rate of  
4½ percent , reflecting  recent  idiosyncratic  increases  in food prices in some economies.  
Thereafter, inflation should moderate to about 3¼ percent over most of the forecast  
period.  Although inflation remains relatively  elevated , downside risks to growth from the  
deteriorating  external  outlook prompted us  to scale back our  expectations of monetary  
policy tightening for  a number of EMEs and to pencil in outright cuts in policy rates for  
Brazil and Mexico .  Indeed, Brazil already lowered its policy  rate 50 basis points  in late  
August.   
China     
Economic activity in China appears to have  remained robust in the third quarter, 
largely supported by domestic demand.  Retail sales growth slowed in July  and August  
but to a still strong 17 percent on a 12-month basis, and fixed- asset investment has  
maintained growth of 25 percent  all  year.  The manufacturing  PMI has stabilized at 
around 51 after declining earlier in the  year, but the new export orders subindex i ndicates  
weakening  external demand.  We project Chinese real GDP to grow at  an annual rate of  
around 8¼ percent over the forecast period, as Chinese authorities adjust the policy mix  
as necessary to prevent overheating but still maintain solid growth.  This forecast is a bit 
lower than in the August  Tealbook.  
Chinese headline inflation edged down in August  to 6¼ percent on a 12-month 
basis.  We project i nflation will continue to move down to a bit below 3 percent in 2012 
and 2013, reflecting the waning  effects of  previous increases in pork and other food 
prices.  In the  face of elevated inflation and continued high credit  growth, t he People’s  
Bank of China broadened the range of deposits subject to reserve requirements; when fully phased in, the broadening will be roughly  equivalent to an increase in reserve  
requirements under the old standard of about 1¼ percentage points.

Other Em erging Asia  
Elsewhere in  emerging Asia, data for July and August  indicate that  exports and 
industrial production declined in most of the region.  The PMI  readings fell abruptly  
below the 50 benchmark for a number  of economies, led by  declines in the  subindexes for  
new export orders.  We  expect real GDP  growth in the region to rise  to 4½  percent  in the  
current quarter , helped by  the temporary boost  from Japan’s recovery.  Thereafter, we 
estimate that real GDP growth will slow again toward  year-end before r ising to 5 percent  
by  late 2013.  Based on the weaker recent data on manufacturing a  ctivity, the growth 
forecast  for the  region is down a  bit relative to the  August Tealbook.  
Headline  in flation  in the  region is projected to rise to an annual rate of  3½ percent  
in the current quarter .  Concerns about heightened inflationary pressures prompted the  
Bank of  Thailand to rais e its  policy rate  again  in August.  However, the  central banks in 
Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines  refrained from  tightening in recent months, citing  
the heightened risk from the global slowdown.  
Latin America  
In Mexico, real GDP expanded at an  annual rate of  4½ percent in the  second  
quarter, about 2 percentage points faster than we estimated  in the August Tealbook.  
Economic growth was supported in part by a strong expansion of industrial  output.  We  
expect GDP growth in Mexico to remain robust at 4¼ percent in the current quarter  
before slowing to roughly  3¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast period.  On 
average, our projection for the next few quarters is marked down about ¼ percentage 
point, reflecting downward revisions to the outlook for U.S. manufacturing.   
In contrast, GDP  growth in South America  slowed  to 3¼ percent  in the second 
quarter, almost 1 percentage point below our August Tealbook projection, largely  
reflecting a   moderation of growth in Brazil .  In recent months, the PMI readings for  
Brazilian manufacturing ha  ve moved down sharply  to below the 50 benchmark, and the  
labor market has cooled somewhat, although the services sector remains resilient.  We 
project that growth in Brazil will persist at around 3¼  percent in the second half of 2011 
and next  year, as the  country’s  commodity export and manufacturing sectors are held 
back by the weakness in advanced economies.  We then expect that output  growth will 
improve to 4 percent by late 2013.

Headline inflation in Mexico is projected to  pick up to an annual rate of about  
3½ percent  in the second half of this  year  from 1¾  percent in the second quarter, 
reflecting  the reversal of  a temporary  energy subsidy  implemented in late spring .  In  
contrast, we  expect quarterly inflation in Brazil to moderate to an annual pace of roughly  
5 percent in the second half, down from 7½ percent in the second quarter.  Although 
12-month inflation is likely to persist above the  central bank’s  target range for the rest of  
the year,  the bank lowered its  policy  rate 50 basis points to 12 percent in late August in 
the face of the weaker outlook for  external demand .

Financial Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, investors cont inued to pull back from riskier assets 
on an intensification of concerns about the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and in 
response to weaker-than-expected incomi ng data on economic activity in the United 
States and abroad.  Safe-haven flows and mounting expectations for additional 
nonconventional monetary policy stimulus by th e FOMC contributed to an appreciable 
fall in intermediate- and longer- term nominal Treasury yields.  The expected path of the 
federal funds rate moved down, largely in response to the FOMC’s August statement that 
included firmer forward guidance.   Partly in reaction to the deterioration in the economic 
outlook, investors priced in somewhat lower inflation compensation.  Yield spreads on 
U.S. corporate bonds increased significantly, a nd broad indexes of U.S. equity prices 
fluctuated widely, although they ended the pe riod higher on net.  In the euro area, stock 
prices declined and spreads on most periphe ral sovereign bonds widened further because 
of investors’ worries about a default by Greece and the possible knock-on effects for 
other euro-area sovereigns and financial institutions.  In unsecured dollar funding 
markets, many European banks faced strain ed conditions, as funding costs climbed and 
term funding became even harder to obtain.  
The most recent data on credit flows in the United States were mixed.  In the 
nonfinancial corporate sector, issuance of inve stment-grade bonds was solid in August, as 
highly rated companies continued to find historically low yields  attractive.  In contrast, 
issuance of high-yield bonds last mont h was the weakest since December 2008, and 
issuance of leveraged loans to institutional inve stors appears to have fallen in August.  In 
the household sector, consumer credit expande d in July despite a decline in revolving 
credit, while measures of consumer credit  quality generally continued to improve.  
Interest rates on conforming home mortgages decreased a little since early August but 
appeared to elicit only mode st refinancing activity; meanwhile, the volume of mortgage 
applications for home purchases remained ve ry low.  Bank credit expanded moderately in 
August, reflecting increases in both loans and securi ties holdings.  In August, M2 surged 
again, as investors and money fund managers sought the sa fety of insured deposits.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Rates on money market futures maturing beyond the third quarter of 2012 and 
nominal Treasury yields declined signif icantly following the release of the August 
FOMC statement; market participants focused on the revision to the statement’s forward 
guidance indicating that the Co mmittee anticipated that econo mic conditions are likely to 
warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at  least through mid-2013.1   
Investors also took note of the FOMC’s  downbeat assessment of recent economic 
developments and its recognition of heightened downside risks to the outlook.   Over the 
following weeks, weaker data here and abro ad reinforced investors’ perceptions of 
increasing risks to the global economic outlook, and investors marked up their 
expectations for additional monetary accommodation.  Chairman Bernanke’s speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole 
and the August FOMC minutes were seen by mark et participants as consistent with their 
views that additional monetary policy stimulus was likely.  Subsequently, the much weaker-than-expected employ ment report for August report edly further raised the 
perceived odds of an easing of po licy at the September FOMC meeting. 
Over the intermeeting period as a whole, the mean path of the expected federal 
funds rate over the next two years moved down appreciably.
2  This path, which is 
estimated from OIS rates, indicates that market  participants expect the federal funds rate 
to first rise marginally above the current target range in the se cond quarter of 2013, one 
quarter later than had been expected at th e time of the August FO MC meeting.  (See the 
box “Policy Rate Expectations and Term Prem iums.”)  The modal path for the federal 
funds rate derived from interest rate caps remained extremely flat and indicates that 
market participants expect the federal funds ra te is most likely to stay within the current 
target range beyond the end of 2014.  The firmi ng of the FOMC’s forward guidance in its 
August statement contributed to a drop in market-based measures of policy uncertainty over the next few years. 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 9 basi s points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.  European banks continued to experience higher 
borrowing costs than their peers.  The Open Market Desk purchased a total of $14 billion of longer-term 
Treasury securities during the intermeeting period, consiste nt with the policy to reinvest principal payments 
from its securities holdings. 
2 As noted in the box “Policy Rate Expectations and Term Premiums,” the estimated federal funds 
rate paths now assume that there is no term premium in the OIS rate curve.  Term premiums currently 
appear to be unusually low, reflecting investors’ confidence that policy will remain on hold for quite some 
time.

Policy  Rate  Expectations  and  Term   Premiums   
The  Board  staff  recently  implemented   some  modest  changes  in  its  computations  of  the  
expected   federal  funds  rate  path.    
Traditionally,   the  staff  used  federal  funds  and  Eurodollar   futures  to  derive  the  expected   federal  
funds  rate  path  for  horizons  of  up  to  two  years;  these  contracts   are  quite  liquid  and  widely  used  
by  market  participants   as  indicators   of  policy  expectations.    Two  transformations   were  applied  
to  raw  futures  rates.   First,  federal  funds  versus  Libor  basis  swap  spreads  were  subtracted   from  
the  Eurodollar   futures  rates  to  make  them  comparable   to  federal  funds  futures  rates.   Second,   
federal   funds  futures  rates  were  converted   into  expected   federal   funds  rates  by  subtracting   a  
judgmental   estimate  of  the  term  premium   priced  into  the  futures  rates.   For  most  of  the  last  
few  years,  the  staff  assumed  a  term  premium   of  1  basis  point  per  month.   But  that  assumption   
recently  generated   estimates   of  expected   federal  funds   rates  that  were  negative.    As  a  result,  
since  August  7,  the  staff  has  been  assuming   a  term  premium   of  zero  basis  points  per  month  in  
this  calculation.     
Another  problem  that  the  staff  encountered   with  the  traditional   methodology   was  that  the  use  
of  federal  funds   and  Eurodollar  futures  rates  sometimes   generated   kinks  in  the  estimated   
expected   federal  funds  rate  path  on  the  date  of  the  shift  from  federal  funds  to  Eurodollar  
futures.   To  avoid  such  problems,  the  staff  recently  shifted  to  using  the  overnight  index  swap  
(OIS)  curve  as  the  basis  for  its  expected   funds  rate  calculations.    OIS  rates  are  analogous   to  
federal  funds  futures  rates,  and  the  OIS  market  has  become  increasingly   liquid  over  time.   By  
using  a  single  data  source,  policy  rate  expectations   based  on  the  OIS  curve  are  less  subject  to  
the  data  problems   present  under  our  previous  procedure.   Under  the  new  procedure,  the  staff  
uses  the  raw  OIS  data  to  estimate  forward  OIS  rates  and  then  subtracts   a  term  premium   
estimate  from  these  forward  rates  to  obtain  the  expected  funds  rate  path.   As  previously  noted,  
the  currently  assumed  monthly  term  premium  is  zero  basis  points  per  month.   The  figure  below  
shows  that  the  expected  funds  rate  paths  calculated   under  the  old  and  the  new  method  are  
quite  similar.

The  assumption   of  a  constant  term  premium   is  a  strong  one.   Indeed,  research  has  generally   
shown  that  term  premiums   are  time  varying.1   To  estimate  a  time‐varying  term  premium   
directly,  the  staff  is  developing   a  three‐factor   no‐arbitrage  term  structure  model  for  OIS  rates.2   
As  illustrated   in  the  lower‐ left  figure,  a  preliminary   version  of  this  model  suggests  that  the  term  
premium   has  varied  significantly   over  time  and  currently   stands  at  about  negative  1  basis  point  
per  month  at  the  12‐month  horizon.   With  a  negative  term  premium,  the  model‐ based  expected   
funds  rate  path  is  somewhat   above  the  path  calculated   with  the  assumed  term  premium   of  zero  
basis  points  and  implies  that  the  federal  fund  rate  will  first  rise  above  the  current  target  range  in  
the  first  quarter  of  2013  (lower‐right  figure).   For  now,  the  staff  will  employ  its  judgmental   term  
premium   assumption   along  with  OIS  rates  to  calculate  the  expected   funds  rate  path  but  will  
continue  to  refine  work  on  the  term  structure  modeling   of  the  OIS  curve  with  the  goal  of  
developing   reliable  joint  estimates   of  the  expected   funds  rate  path  and  a  time‐varying  term  
premium.   This  work  and  past  efforts  to  identify  a  time‐varying  term  premium   point  to  the  
uncertainties   associated   with  market‐based  estimates   of  the  expected   trajectory   of  the  federal  
funds  rate.

Results from the Open Market Desk’s latest survey of primary dealers also 
suggested a marked downward shift in the anti cipated path of the federal funds rate.  
Respondents pushed out the most likely timing fo r liftoff of the federa l funds rate target 
to the end of 2013, slightly more than one year later than at the time of the August 
survey.  Additionally, in response to ques tions about possible easing options, dealers 
assigned greater probabilities that each of five possible tools—re ducing the IOER rate, 
purchasing securities, increasing the durati on of SOMA holdings, changing the federal 
funds rate guidance, and providing guidance on the size of the SOMA portfolio—would 
be used within one year.  The rise in the pr obability that dealers put on an increase in the 
average duration of SOMA holdings (from a probability of 25 percent before the August 
meeting to a probability of 75 percent currentl y) was particularly notable and made this 
easing tool the one seen as most likely to be  used within one year.  Dealers revised down 
their forecasts of real GDP growth in 2011—to an average of 1¼ percent from  
1¾ percent at the time of th e August survey.  They also revised down their growth 
forecasts for 2012 and 2013, although to a somewhat lesser degree, and they marked up 
their forecasts for the unemployment rate for each of the next three years.  Dealers’  
forecasts for core and headline PCE inflation from 2011 through 2013 were revised down 
a touch, on balance, while their estimates of  longer-term CPI inflation were little 
changed.  The reported degree of uncertainty ab out their inflation forecasts was about the 
same as in August.    
Yields on intermediate-term nominal Treas ury securities have decreased further, 
on net, since the August FOMC m
eeting, reachi ng levels not seen since the 1940s.  Over 
the intermeeting period, yields on 2-year nomin al securities edged down 5 basis points, 
consistent with the decrease in money market  futures rates.  However, 5-year nominal 
yields fell about 20 basis points, and 10-  to 30-year yields dropped around 40 basis 
points, with the 10-year yield standing a touch above 2 percent at the end of the period.  
The larger declines in longer-dated yields were consistent with heightened concerns about slower global economic growth and i nvestors’ growing expectations that the 
FOMC would provide further monetary policy accommodation at the September meeting 
by extending the duration of the SOMA portfol io’s securities holdings.  Indeed, on the 
day of the August employment report, Treasur y yields at maturities of 10 years and 
longer fell 15 basis points or more while sh orter-term yields edged up, reportedly on the 
view that the Federal Reserv e would extend duration by purch asing long-term securities 
and selling short-term securities from the SOMA portfolio.  The downgrade of the long-
term sovereign credit rating of the Unite d States from AAA to AA+ by Standard &

Poor’s (S&P) just before the August FOMC meeting did not appear to reduce market 
participants’ preferences for the relative safe ty and liquidity of Treasury securities over 
the intermeeting period.  In September, res pondents to the Senior Credit Officer Opinion 
Survey on Dealer Financing Terms reported little change in funding terms for U.S. 
Treasury securities following the downgrade.  (See the appendix on the survey at the end 
of this section.) 
TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead 
fell about 35 basis points and 45 basis points, respectively, reaching the low ends of their 
ranges this year.  Safe-haven flows and incr eased speculation about a ma
turity extension 
program for the SOMA portfolio likely pushed down longer-dated nominal Treasury 
yields, amplifying the drop in measured infla tion compensation.  That said, staff models 
suggest that the intermeeti ng decrease in TIPS-based inflation compensation reflected 
importantly a combination of lower expected in flation and lower inflation risk premiums.  
Swaps-based measures of inflation compensa tion—which were probably less affected by 
the relative liquidity of nominal Treasury securities—also decreased considerably over 
the period.  Meanwhile, measures of short- and long-term inflation expectations from the 
Michigan survey were about unchanged last month. 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING  MARKETS  
Investor sentiment toward large bank ing organizations has deteriorated 
considerably since the beginning of August.  Fears of a slowdown in global growth, legal 
risks related to the marketing of private-label residential mortgage-b acked securities at 
the height of the housing boom, and concerns about spillovers of stress related to the 
fiscal crisis in Europe have all led investors to pull back from the equity and debt of U.S. 
financial firms.  Since early August, equity  prices for large U.S. banking firms have 
fallen 13 percent, significantly underperformi ng the broader market, and CDS spreads for 
large U.S. financial institutions have incr eased sharply.  More pronounced declines in 
equity prices and sharp increases in CDS spreads occurred for European financial 
institutions, and European authorities in se veral countries reacted by banning short sales 
of financial stocks.  For U.S. banks, equity prices and CDS spreads are near the levels 
seen in the middle of 2009, while for Europ ean banks, CDS spreads are higher than at 
any point in the global financia l crisis and equity prices are near their crisis lows. 
Pressures in unsecured dollar funding markets have increased in recent weeks for 
European banks.  Since the beginning of August, Libor–OIS spreads have moved up

significantly, particularly at horizons beyond one month.  In addition, there has been 
considerable tiering in funding costs based on investors’ perc eptions of the exposures of 
European financial institutions.  More fo rward-looking measures of interbank funding 
costs—such as the spread between a forward ra te agreement and the rate on an OIS three 
to six months ahead—also rose, suggesting that market participants may expect 
conditions in unsecured funding markets to de teriorate somewhat further.  The three-
month euro–dollar implied basis swap spr ead—an alternative meas ure of dollar funding 
costs facing European institutions—jumped to levels last seen in late 2008.  Market 
participants indicated that Eu ropean financial firms have fo und it increasingly difficult to 
obtain unsecured dollar funding for maturities beyond one week, increasing their rollover risk.  Pressures were most acute for French banks based on investors’ perceptions of their 
outsized exposures to vulnerable euro-area countries and their heavy use of wholesale 
dollar funding and relatively thin capital cushions.   
In contrast, conditions facing United States-chartered financ ial institutions in 
unsecured term dollar funding m 
arkets have changed relatively lit tle.  Given domestic 
institutions’ ample deposits and reserves, their need for unsecured short-term funding has 
likely been limited of late.   
The problems that European banks had obtaining unsecured dollar funding were 
evident in the balance sheets of their U.S br anches.   Large time deposits at their U.S. 
branches have been steadily  dropping since early June, wh ile other deposits have grown 
only slightly.  However, these institutions have  offset a sizable portion of the decline in 
large time deposits with increased net borro wing from their parent offices and other 
related institutions.  This compositional shift in managed liabilities was 
disproportionately seen on th e books of U.S. branches with French parents.   
U.S. money market funds and other invest ors continued to cut their exposures to 
French, Italian, and Spanish entities over the intermeeting period, partic ularly in terms of 
unsecured funding.3  Outstanding unsecured financial commercial paper (CP) for all 
European issuers decreased, on net, and CP  issued by firms with parents in France 
contracted sharply further.  In addition, the fraction of CP issued with very short 
maturities—one to four days—has remained extremely high for European financial firms (over 80 percent).  Similarly, the amount of negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs) 
issued in dollars by institutions with Eur opean parents continued to decline, and the 
3 Money fund exposures to Greece, Portugal,  and Ireland are essentially zero.

average maturity of these CDs continued to  shorten.  At the end of August, almost 
60 percent of the funding provided by U.S. m oney market funds to European banks had a 
maturity of one week or less—a fraction that is up from 45 percent in June. 
With regard to secured funding, the repo market for Treasury and agency 
collater
al is reported to have functioned well in recent weeks for both domestic and 
European financial institutions.  However, some strains began to emerge late in the 
intermeeting period in the market for re pos backed by lower-quality, nontraditional 
collateral.  Spreads of AA-rated asset-back ed commercial paper (ABCP) climbed notably 
in recent weeks, likely reflecting uncertainty about the health of the European sponsors of 
ABCP programs. 
FOREIGN  DEVELOPMENTS  
Investors’ concerns about the deepening of  the European sovereign debt crisis and 
generally weaker-than-expected incoming econo mic data kept foreign financial markets 
under pressure over the intermeeting period.  Foreign equity pr ices and benchmark 
sovereign yields declined, while the broad i ndex of the foreign exchange value of the 
dollar rose.   
Investors continued to demand greater co mpensation for exposure to peripheral 
euro-area sovereign debt over the period.  The yield on two-year Greek sovereign bonds 
soared to 75 percent amid a growing percep tion that euro-area leaders will not reach a 
solution to Greece’s debt problems in time to av oid a unilateral default.   In response to a 
spike in European sovereign bond yields, the ECB announced on August 7 a resumption 
of its Securities Markets Programme, which wa s extended to include purchases of Italian 
and Spanish bonds.  Since resumption, the E CB purchased about €70 billion in securities 
through September 9, and yields on Italian and Spanish securities declined even as CDS 
premiums on those securities continued to move higher.  French CDS premiums also 
rose, reaching 190 basis points, well above the levels normally associated with a rating of 
AAA.  (For additional discussion of inte rmeeting developments, see the box “Recent

grade corporate bonds relative to comparable-m aturity sovereign secu rities continued to 
rise in August, reachi ng elevated levels.   
Concerns over the global growth outlook a nd the European fiscal crisis prompted 
a drop in Canadian, German, 
and U.K. 10-year benchmark sovereign yields over the 
period; yields in all three countries fell more  than 30 basis points to  reach their lowest 
levels in decades.  For the euro area and United Kingdom, expected overnight rates 
derived from OIS rates for late 2013 fell more than 25 basis points.  Expected policy rates 
for the Bank of Canada are little changed since the August FOMC meeting but remain 
considerably lower than their levels in early August.  
On net, the broad nominal foreign excha nge value of the dollar increased over the 
period as the demand for safe-haven assets incr eased.  Safe-haven flows also continued to 
buoy the yen and the Swiss franc, and the Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank (SNB) separately intervened to count er further appreciation of th eir currencies.  On August 4, 
Japanese authorities intervened in forei gn exchange markets, purchasing $58 billion, 
more than double their previous one-day r ecord.  Although the yen immediately dropped, 
the currency more than retraced that move in subsequent weeks.  On September 6, the 
SNB announced it would establish an exchange  rate floor of 1.2 Swiss francs per euro, 
pledging to buy unlimited quantities of foreign currenc y to prevent a breach of this level.    
The SNB’s exchange rate announcement followe d large-scale injectio ns of Swiss-franc 
liquidity, which raised sight deposits from  30 billion to 200 billion Swiss francs over the 
course of August.   
After having fallen steeply in the we eks before the August FOMC meeting, 
emerging market equity prices moved lit tle, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
although emerging market equity funds expe rienced sharp outflows throughout August.  
Citing concerns over the global outlook, the central bank of Br azil unexpectedly reversed 
some of its recent tightening and cut its pol icy rate 50 basis points to 12 percent on 
August 31.  In contrast, China continued to ti ghten its monetary policy stance, extending 
reserve requirements to a wider range of bank liabilities as it attempted to rein in off-balance-sheet lending by its banks. 
In a continuation of the trend seen over th e first half of the year, foreign private 
investors sold Treasury securities, on net, in July and showed limited appetite for other 
U.S. securities.  Foreign official investors sold Treasury bills in July, when debt ceiling  
anxiety about near-term Treasury payments was at a peak, but maintained demand for

long-term Treasury securities.  FRBNY custody data suggest that, on balance, official 
holdings of all Treasury securiti es declined slightly in Augus t, also continuing the trend 
of slower official net purchases. 
DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
On net since the August FOMC meeting, broad stock price indexes increased 
almost 5 percent.  However, the increase over the intermeeting period followed sharp 
declines in equity prices in the days just  preceding the meeting, and since the publication 
of the August Tealbook, broad equity price inde xes have fallen more than 6 percent, on 
net.  Moreover, the intermeeting period has been punctuated by episodes of heightened 
volatility, with the VIX, an index of imp lied volatility, rising to  around 40 percentage 
points at times.  Since early August, news about faltering ne gotiations around solutions to 
the European sovereign debt crisis and w eaker-than-expected economic data releases 
appear to have contributed to a broad pullback in investors’ desire to  hold riskier assets.  
The staff’s estimate of the equity risk prem ium for shares in th e S&P 500—measured as 
the spread between the expect ed real equity return for the S&P 500 index and the real 
10-year Treasury yield—widened substantially,  on net, in August and early September to 
a level not seen since 2009.   
Since early August, the pr icing of a range of busin ess debt instruments has 
generally reflected an increase in compen sation for credit risk.  Most prominently, 
spreads of yields on investment- and specu lative-grade corporat e bonds over those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities increa sed sharply, reaching leve ls last registered 
in late 2009.  In addition, average bid pri ces in the secondary market for syndicated 
leveraged loans dropped in recent weeks, and bid-asked spreads in that market jumped.  
The most recent Survey of Terms of Busi ness Lending, conducted the week of August 1, 
showed that, adjusted for changes in com position, spreads of rates on C&I loans of less 
than $25 million over banks’ cost of funds stopped their recent declines and remained at 
very high levels.  Spreads of yields on A2 /P2-rated unsecured CP issued by nonfinancial 
firms over yields on A1/P1-rated issues edged up on net. 
Overall, respondents to the September 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey 
on Dealer Financing Terms pointed to small mixed changes in credit terms across major 
classes of counterparties over th e past three months; this c ontrasts with the broad-based 
easing that had been seen since the inaugur al survey in June 2010.  In addition, a 
significant majority of dealers indicated th at the amount of res ources and attention

devoted to management of concentrated e xposures to central c ounterparties and other 
financial intermediaries had increased, likel y reflecting concerns about exposures to 
European financial institutions and markets.   Dealers further noted that the use of 
financial leverage by hedge funds had decrease d somewhat over the past three months.   
In response to a special question, dealers indica ted that their clients’  appetite to bear 
investment risk had generally declined somewhat over the past three months for all types 
of clients, and the pullback from risk  was more pronounced among hedge funds.   
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Credit flows for nonfinancial firms were mi xed in August, with some evidence of 
strains for lower-rated firms.  Net bond issuance remained robust for investment-grade 
nonfinancial companies despite wider spread s, but issuance by sp eculative-grade firms 
nearly came to a halt amid sharply higher yields in that segment of the market.  In 
August, nonfinancial CP outstanding incr eased slightly and C&I loans outstanding 
expanded again.  In the leveraged loan market, issuance financed by institutional 
investors slowed in July and appears to have dropped sharply in August. 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinanci al firms weakened substantially in 
recent weeks, with a large number of firms sh elving planned IPOs amid substantial equity 
market volatility.  Net equity issuance is projected to have remained negative in the 
second quarter, reflecting the continued streng th of share repurchases and cash-financed 
mergers by nonfinancial firms, which are, on average, flush with cash and generating 
substantial profits.  Preliminary data on merger activity and announcements of new share repurchase programs suggest that net equity issuance will likely remain deeply negative 
in the third quarter.  
With virtually all firms in the S&P 5 00 having now reported, operating earnings 
per share are estimated to have decreased slig htly in the second quarter.  However, that 
decline reflects a substantial drop in prof its at a single large banking institution that 
reported a costly mortgage-rela ted legal settlement.  In co ntrast, earnings per share for 
nonfinancial firms grew at a to rrid 10 percent quar terly rate, with gain s widespread across 
industries.  Looking forward, analysts are curr ently forecasting solid earnings growth in 
the coming year for firms in the S&P 500, and those forecasts for year-ahead earnings 
were little revised, in the aggregate, ov er the four weeks ending in mid-August.

Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinan cial corporations have continued to be 
quite solid.  The aggregate ratio of debt to assets stayed lo w in the second quarter, and the 
liquid asset ratio ticked down but remained ne ar its highest level in over 20 years.  
Delinquency rates on C&I loans held by banks de creased further last quarter and are in 
the range last registered in the second half  of 2008.  The volume of corporate bonds that 
Moody’s Investors Service upgraded in July  and August substantially outpaced the 
volume that it downgraded, and the six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial 
firms inched down a bit closer to zero last month.  Nonetheless, the expected year-ahead 
default rate for nonfinancial firms from the Moody’s KMV model remained somewhat  
elevated in August, reflecting low equity valuations and high stock price volatility. 
Financing conditions for commercial real estate m arkets remained weak overall, 
and conditions appeared to have  deteriorated in some respects over the summer.  Issuance 
of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) slowed further in July and August, 
and investors appeared to demand greater co mpensation for risk, as implied by a further 
widening of spreads on CMBS index prices in August.  Prices of most types of 
commercial properties remained depressed desp ite a slight decline in aggregate vacancy 
rates for commercial properties last quarter.  Delinquency rates on loans in CMBS pools 
hovered at an elevated level in August, while  delinquency rates on commercial real estate 
loans held by banks decreased in the second quarter. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Residential mortgage interest rates and yields on current-coupon agency MBS 
declined, on net, over the intermeeting period to historically low levels even as their 
spreads to Treasury yields increased.  Th e low rates did not spur much mortgage 
refinancing activity, in part because tight underwriting and lo w levels of home equity 
continued to limit many households’ access to  the mortgage market.  Residential 
mortgage debt contracted further in the second quarter, and the volume of mortgage 
applications to purchase a home has moved down, on net, this quarter.   
Amid a large inventory of unsold propert ies and weak demand for homes, the 
seasonally adjusted repeat-sales house price index from CoreLogic inched down in July, 
although the rate of decline ha s slowed significantly in recen t months.  Rates of serious 
mortgage delinquency—defined as the percentage  of mortgage loans that are 90 days past 
due or in foreclosure—continued to modera te but remained high, in part reflecting 
persistent delays in the foreclosure proce ss.  The rate at which prime mortgages are

transitioning from “current” to delinquent, wh ich had flattened out ear lier in the year at  
an elevated level, has moved up, on balance, in recent months—a tre nd that could reflect 
the effects of the weaker labor market a nd deeper negative equity positions for many 
homeowners. 
Consumer credit increased at an annual ra te of 6 percent in July, a touch fa ster 
than in June.  In July, a sizable increas e in nonrevolving credit—driven by a surge in 
federally funded student loans—more than offset a decrease in revolving credit.  Weekly 
data on bank credit suggest that revolving cr edit remained weak in August.  Issuance of 
consumer credit ABS moved down in August, but  spreads remain low and the securities 
have generally performed well during the recen t market volatility.  Delinquency rates for 
several categories of consumer loans moved down further in recent months, and some  
reached levels not seen since the recession be gan; the delinquency rate on credit card 
loans in securitized pools has fallen to an all-time low.  However, the decline in 
delinquency rates partly reflects tighter unde rwriting, which has shifted the composition 
of borrowers toward those with stronger credit histories.  
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury Department issued about $237 billion 
of nominal coupon securities across the matur ity spectrum and $12 billion of TIPS.  The 
auctions were generally well received desp ite S&P’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign 
credit rating on August 5.  However, the 30-year bond auction on August 11, which took 
place following a sudden and steep decline in longer-term Treasury yields and amid 
pronounced volatility, experien ced weak demand, as evidenced by a low bid-to-cover 
ratio, a relatively small share of indirect bidding, and lower-than -expected pricing.   
Market participants remain concerned about the finances of state and local 
governments.  In particular, S&P downgraded so me state and local credits in the wake of 
its downgrade of long-term Treasury debt.  Long-term issuance of municipal bonds 
remained quite sluggish by historical standa rds in August but picked up slightly from  
July’s low level.  CDS spreads for states increased somewhat over the intermeeting 
period, and yields on long-term general obligation (GO) municipal bonds decreased less 
than Treasury yields.  As a consequence,  the ratio of GO bond yields to yields on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities—a gauge of the risk priced into municipal 
bonds—increased to levels la st seen in early 2009.

COMMERCIAL BANKING AND  MONEY  
The profitability of bank holding compan ies (BHCs) edged down in the second 
quarter of 2011 and remained significantly lowe r than the average levels seen before 
2007.  In the aggregate, profitability of the la rgest five BHCs declin ed, primarily because 
of mortgage-related losses at one large bank and disappointing trading results at another; 
profitability continued to trend higher among in stitutions outside the largest five.  For the 
industry as a whole, net income continued to be supported in the first half of this year by 
a lower level of loan loss provisions amid continued improvement in credit quality across 
most asset classes.  Net charge-offs again ex ceeded provisions last quarter, and the stock 
of loan loss reserves declined  to its lowest level since the first quarter of 2009.  Although 
the industry Tier 1 leverage ratio ticked dow n slightly, partially as  a result of balance 
sheet expansion related to the surge in deposits at commercial bank subsidiaries, 
regulatory capital ratios in the second quarter remained toward the high ends of their 
historical ranges. 
After falling slightly during the first half of the year, bank credit grew at an  
average annual rate of about 6 percent in July  and August, reflecting both an expansion of 
loans and a resumption of securities purchases.  Core loans expande d slightly, with the 
upturn in lending concentrated at large dom estic and foreign institutions.  At smaller 
banks, core loans declined in July and A ugust at about the same pace as in recent  
quarters.  Strong increases in C&I loans were fairly evenly distributed across most large 
domestic banks and many foreign-related institutions.  In contrast, growth of C&I loans 
at small banks—a rough proxy for lending to small businesses—remained sluggish.  Commercial real estate loans continued to contract in July  and August at about the same  
rate as earlier in the year.  Banks’ holdings  of closed-end residen tial loans, which had 
declined steeply over the first five months of 2011, rebounded slightly in June and grew 
at an average annual rate of about 4 percen t in July and August, an increase perhaps 
related to the small rise in refinancing activity in response to historically low mortgage 
rates.  However, home equity loans funded by ba nks declined further.  Consumer loans at 
banks were roughly flat, on balance, in July and August after accoun ting for purchases of 
loans from nonbanks.   
Substantial increases in banks’ holdings of noncore loans accounted for much of 
the growth in total loans in July and August.  In particular, reverse repurchase agreements 
with nonbank counterparties expanded, as did the “all other loans”  component, which 
Financial Developments

includes overdrafts and loans to municipali ties, foreign banks, and nonbank financial 
institutions.  However, banks’ holdings of noncore loans tend to be volatile, and they 
appear to have declined some since peaking in mid-August.  Banks’ holdings of securities 
grew at a moderate pace during the two mont hs as a decrease in Treasury securities was 
more than offset by a large increase in their hol dings of agency MBS and other securities.   
Core deposits at domestic banks have surged in recent months, prim arily 
reflecting large inflows of dema nd deposits at many large banks.4  On balance, these 
flows have been mostly offset by declin es in nondeposit liabilities, particularly 
borrowings from foreign affiliates as well as from nonbanks (the latter constituting a 
category that includes borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks).5  The staff estimates 
that the influx of core deposits over the summ er has left a few dome stic banks near the 
regulatory threshold for their leverage ra tio (5 percent of total average assets).6    
M2 expanded at an annual rate of 29 percent, on average, in July and August—the 
fastest pace since the fall of 2008—as investor s and asset m
anagers sought the relative 
safety and liquidity of M2 assets.  Spooke d by developments in Europe and wary of 
prime money funds’ exposures to European fi nancial institutions, in stitutional investors 
shifted from prime money funds to ba nk deposits, while money fund managers 
accumulated sizable bank deposits in antic ipation of potential large redemptions by 
investors.  In addition, retail investors evid ently placed their redemptions from equity and 
bond mutual funds into bank deposits and reta il money market funds.  All told, demand 
deposits—which are fully insured by the FDIC —surged at an annual rate of 140 percent 
over July and August.7  The monetary base contracted slightly as reserve balances of 
depository institutions decreased.  (See the box “Balance Sheet Developments over the 
Intermeeting Period.”) 
4 Core deposits are defined as total deposits minus large time deposits. 
5 A large share of the recent increases in deposits re flected the decision of one large domestic bank 
to book some deposits at its head office rather than at a foreign branch; those increases were about offset by 
reductions in borrowings from that branch, leaving little overall imprint on the balance sheet of that institution. 
6 Based on Call Report data and weekly balance sheet data, the staff estimates that one large 
custodian bank is likely very near the threshold, while one other large commercial bank and two relatively 
small banks are estimated to be fairly close to the threshold. 
7 Noninterest-bearing demand deposits are fully  insured by the FDIC until the end of 2012.

Balance  Sheet  Developments   over  the  Intermeeting  Period  
Over  the  intermeeting   period,   total  assets  of  the  Federal  Reserve  edged  down  to  
$2,866   billion  (see  table  on  facing  page).   Since   the  August  FOMC  meeting,   the  
Open   Market  Desk  at  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  New  York  (FRBNY)  conducted   
seven  permanent  operations,   purchasing   $14  billion  in  longer‐term  Treasury  
securities   as  part  of  the  policy  of  reinvesting   principal  payments   from  agency  
debt  and  agency  MBS.1  
The  net  portfo
lio  holdings  of  Maiden   Lane  LLC  declined  $3  billion,  reflecting   asset  
sales;  the  proceeds   from  these   sales  were  applied  in  mid‐ August  toward  the  
repayment   of  the  FRBNY’s  senior  loan  to  that  LLC.   The  net  portfolio  holdings   of  
Maiden   Lane  II  and  Maiden  Lane  III  LLCs  were  nearly  unchanged.    Loans  
outstanding   under  the  Term  Asset‐Backed  Securities   Loan   Facility  remained  
around  $12  billion.   Foreign   central  banks’  use  of  liquidity  swap  lines  remained   
modest;   two  draws  under  swap  arrangements   occurred   in  August,  one  by  the  
Swiss   National  Bank  for  roughly  $200   million  and  the  other  by  the  European   
Central  Bank  for  about  $500  million.   Accrued  interest  (not  shown)   also  stepped  
down  with   the  receipt  of  payments   of  interest  on  the  Federal  Reserve’s  total  
securities   holdings.  
On  the  liability  side  of  the  Federal   Reserve’s   balance  sheet,  Federal  Reserve  notes  
in  circulation   increased   $7  billion  over  the  period.   The  Treasury’s   General  
Account,   which  is  highly  volatile  from  month  to  month,  decreased  $15  billion.   
Reverse  repurchase   transactions   with  foreign   official  and  international   accounts   
increased   $22  billion  over  the  period.   Reserve  balances  of  depository   institutions   
typically  reflect   the  changes  in  various  asset  and  liability  categories,   and  declined  
$25  billion  over  the  period.    
On  August  12,  2011,  the  FRBNY  announced   that  it  would  conduct  another  series  of  
small‐ scale  reverse  repurchase   transactions   involving   all  eligible  collateral   types  
and  counterparties.    Over  the  intermeeting   period,  the  FRBNY  conducted   two  
reverse  repurchase   transactions   that  included,   for  the  first  time,  Fannie  Mae  and  
Freddie  Mac.   The  application   process  for  banks  and  saving s  associations   to  serve  
as  counterparties   for  reverse  repurchase   agreement   transactions   ended  on  
September   9,  2011.   About  a  dozen  applications   were  received  and  are  currently   
under  review.      
1 These operations include purchases in a range of maturities for nominal securities as well 
as one TIPS operation conducted between August 9 and September 12, 2011. During this 
period, $15 billion in Treasury securities purchases settled on the balance sheet and agency 
debt and MBS holdings declined $15 billion.

Appendix  
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms  
Responses to the September 2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer  
Financing Terms  pointed to  small mixed changes in credit  terms across major classes of  
counterparties, in contrast to the  broad -based easing  that had been seen since the inaugural  survey  
in June 2010.1   On  balance, credit terms offered to  most  major counterparty  types were little  
changed  over the past  three months.  However, nonprice  terms  applied to hedge funds continued 
to ease further while  terms applicable  to  trading real estate investment trusts ( trading REITs) and 
nonfinancial firms tightened a bit.2   A  significant  majority of dealers  reported an  increase in  the  
amount of resources and attention their  firm is  devot ing  to the  management of concentrated  
exposures to dealers and  other financial  intermediaries, as well as to central  counterparties and  
other financial utilities , over the past  three months.   
Regarding  over -the-counter ( OTC )  derivatives , respondents to the September survey  
indicated  that nonprice terms incorporated in new or renegotiated OTC derivatives master  
agreements were little changed over the past  three months.  Initial margin  requirements, which 
fall  outside the scope of the m  aster agreement s  and are set individually  for transactions of  
differing types, were also  little changed  across most underlying collateral types  (underlyings) , 
both for average customers and for most -favored customers.     
Responses  to questions on securities financing pointed to a  tightening of  some of the  
terms under which a broad  spectrum of securities  were financed , although terms on equities  
financing w ere little changed .  These responses stood in contrast  to prior surveys in which 
responses had  generally indicated an easing  of  terms.   The reported tightening  of terms over the  
past  three months was generally evident  for both average and most- favored clients .  Dealers  
further noted that demand for funding corporate bonds  and agency and non- agency residential  
mortgage -backed securities (RMBS )  increased over  the past three months.  Demand for term  
funding with a maturity  in excess of  30 days also  increased  for  these asset categories.   In contrast  
with prior surveys, respondents  indicated that  the  liquidity and f unctioning of  markets in which 
1 The September survey collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three 
months in credit terms and conditions in securities financing an d over -the-counter (OTC) derivatives 
markets.  In addition to the core set of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about 
conditions in funding markets for U.S. Treasury securities; in addition, a second set of special questions 
focuse d on changes in risk appetite for different client types over the past three months and since the 
beginning of the year, and a final set of special questions asked about changes in the use of leverage and in 
the financing of different asset types by trading REITs since the beginning of the year.  The 21 institutions 
participating in the survey account for almost all of the dealer financing of dollar -denominate d securities 
for nondealers and are the most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives markets.  The survey was 
conducted during the period from August 22, 2011, to September 2, 2011. The core questions ask about 
changes between June 2011 and August 2011.

the collateral types  covered by the survey (with the exception of the equity market ) trade  had 
deteriorated  over the past  three months.    
In response to special  ques tions focused on the funding of U.S.  Treasury securities,  
dealers reported  little change in  funding terms over the past  three months despite uncertainties  
surrounding the debt  ceiling negotiations  and the downgrade of  the  U.S. lo ng-term  credit rating  
by Standard & Poor’s  (S&P) .  However, respondents  did note  some  increase in  demand for the 
funding of  Treasury securities as well  as some  deterioration in the  liquidity and functioning of  the  
funding market.  In response to another  set of  special questions on risk appetite, r espondents  
indicated  that their clients’  willingness to bear risk had decreased somewhat, on net, over the past  
three months.  By contrast, risk appetite was little changed  since the start of 2011 for most client  
types except  hedge funds, which exhibited a more pronounced decline.  A f inal  set  of special  
questions found that  the use of  leverage by trading REITs had increased somewhat  since the 
beginning of  the year.  
Although the overall  structure of the survey was n ot altered, the September survey  
reflected  several enhancements introduced  in  response  to feedback from respondents and survey  
users.  For example, additional  detail  was added with  respect  to the coverage by  counterparty and 
collateral type.3   At the same time,  the number of  questions  focused on OTC  derivatives was  
reduced  to better  reflect  the current market practice of  relying upon master agreements, which  
specify many of the material credit  terms and apply across multiple transaction  types.  
COUNTERPARTY  TYPES  
Dealers and  Other Financial I ntermediaries   
In the September survey,  three-fourths  of  respondents reported that the amount of  
resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other  
financial intermedi aries had increased over  the past three months.  Some survey participants 
suggested  that t hese responses largely reflect increased concern about  exposures— whether direct 
or indirect—to European financial  institutions and markets.  
3 Prior surveys asked about four types of counterparties: dealers and other financial intermediaries; 
hedge funds, private equity firms, and other similar private pools of capital; insurance companies, pension 
funds, and other institutional investors; and nonfinancial corporations.  Beginning in September 2011, the survey includes questions regarding eight categories of counterparties:  dealers and other financial

considered lending collateralized by four distinct classes of assets:  high -grade corporate bonds, equities, 
agency RMBS, and other asset -backed securities ( ABS ).  Starting in September 2011, the survey has been 
expanded through the addition of high- yield corporate bonds.  In addition, other ABS has been replaced 
with three narrower categories:  non -agency RMBS, commercial mortgage -backed securities, and consumer 
ABS.

Central Counterparties an d Other Financial Utilities  
More than one-half  of respondents indicated that  the amount of resources  and attention 
devoted to management of  concentrated exposures to  central counterparties and  other  financial  
utilities had increased over  the past  three months.   Several of  these entities were downgraded as a 
direct  consequence of the U.S. sovereign downgrade  by S&P , likely contributing to the  increase  
in resources and attention reportedly brought to bear.  In addition, U.S. Treasury collateral is  
relied u pon for operational  purposes by some clearing organizations, and concerns about  a 
possible deterioration in the functioning of  the Treasury  market  may also have contributed to 
increased scrutiny of  these  organizations by dealers.  
Hedge F unds  
The survey res ponses  reflect , on balance, a slowing over the past  three months in the  
easing of credit  terms offered to hedge funds  that  has been  evident since the inaugural survey in 
June  2010.  In contrast to previous  surveys (in which hedge funds were grouped together with  
private equity firms and “other similar  private pools of  capital”) , responses did not  indicate any  
net easing of price terms.  4   However,  on net, almost one-fourth of respondents, a significantly  
smaller  share  than in the June  2011 survey,  reported having eased nonprice terms offered to 
hedge funds (including  haircuts, maximum  maturity, covenants, cure periods, cross-default  
provisions, or other documentation features)  across all types of  transactions covered in  the 
survey.   The institutions  that reported an easing of  terms pointed to more- aggressive competition  
from other institutions as the main reason for  the changes.  About one- half of respondents to  the 
survey continued to note  an increase in the intensity of  efforts by  hedge funds  to negotiat e more -
favorable price and nonprice terms over the past  three months.   Forty percent of respondents , on 
net, reported that  the use  of financial  leverage by hedge funds , considering the entire range of  
transactions facilitated,  had  decreased somewhat  over t he past three months.  The decline was 
largely evident in the responses of the broadly active firms with a significant presence in most of  
the business areas  covered in  the survey  (broad -scope dealers) .5   Respondents  also  reported that 
the availability of  additional unutilized financial leverage  under  agreements currently in place 
with hedge funds w as  little changed  over the  past three months.  This  response  stands in contrast 
to the  June survey, which indicated that hedge funds’  unused financing capacity had increased 
since the beginning of 2011.   
Trading R eal  Estate  Investment  Trusts 
The survey responses indicated  that, on balance, credit terms offered to trading REITs 
were little changed, alth ough a small net  fraction  of  respondents indicated that they had tightened  
4 For questions that ask about credit terms , reported net percentages equal the percentage of 
institutions that reported tightening terms (“tightened considerably ” or “tightened somewhat ”) minus the 
percentage of institutions that reported eas ing terms (“eased considerably ” or “eased somewh at”). For 
questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the percentage of institutions that reported 
increased demand ( “increased considerably” or “increased somewhat”) minus the percentage of institutions 
that reported decreased demand ( “decreased considerably” or “decreased somewhat”). 
5 Nine of the 21 respondents to the survey are classified as broad -scope dealers.

price terms for  such counterparties  over the past three months , citing worsening  market liquidity  
and functioning as the most important reason for the change.   
Mutual Funds, Exchan ge-Traded Funds, Pension Plans, and Endowments  
The survey responses showed  that, on balance, there had been little change in th  e  price  
and nonprice  credit terms provided to mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, pension plans, and 
endowments over the  past th ree months , as well as the use of leverage by such clients.   
Insurance Companies  
The survey responses indicated  that, on balance, price and nonprice  credit terms provided 
to insurance companies were basically unchanged over  the past  three months  despite a continued  
increase in the intensity of  the efforts of  such clients to negotiate more- favorable terms.  A small  
fraction of dealers , on net, noted  that  the use of financial leverage by insurance companies had  
increased  somewhat.    
Investment Advisors to  Separately Managed Accounts  
The survey responses indicated  that, on balance, price  and nonprice credit  terms  
negotiated by investment advisors on behalf of  separately managed accounts were little changed , 
on net,  over the past  three months.  Although a  small net fraction of respondents indicated that t he  
intensity of efforts by  these accounts  to negotiate more -favorable price and  nonprice terms  had 
increased during the survey period, d ealers reported  that the ir  use of financial  leverage  was 
basically unchanged .   
Nonfinancial Corporations  
Contrary to most other  categories of counterparties, a small net  fraction of respondents  
indicated that, on balance, credit  terms offered to nonfinancial  corporations had tightened 
somewhat  over the  past three months  despite continued efforts by these clients to negotiate more -
favorable terms.  The  tightening was mostly reflected  in  price terms.  Dealers  cited  a worsening in 
market liquidity and functioning  as the most important explanation for the c hange in lending  
posture.   
Mark and Collateral Disputes  
One-fifth of dealers  reported that the volume of mark and collateral  disputes with other  
dealers and hedge funds increased somewhat  over the past  three months, perhaps reflecting an  
environment of  increased market volatility and heightened concerns  about developments in 
Europe and the health  of  financial institutions.   Those respondents reporting  an  increase in  mark  
and collateral disputes, which are often viewed as a leading indicator  of market stress, were all  
broad- scope dealers.  A si milar fraction of respondents  also indicated an increase in the duration 
and persistence of  such disputes with other  dealers.  For all other counterparty types covered by  
the su rvey, the volume, duration, and persistence of mark and collateral disputes were reportedly  
little changed.

OVER-THE-COUNTER  DERIVATIVES  
Over the past  three months, nonprice  terms incorporated in new  or  renegotiated OTC  
derivatives master agreements ( such as requirements for posting additional margins, acceptable 
collateral, recognition of  portfolio or diversification benefits, triggers and covenants, and other  
documentation features  including cure periods and cross- default provisions)  were little changed.   
Initial margin requirements across most underlying collateral  types were also  little changed , 
although small net fractions  of respondents indicated  that initial margin requirements for  average 
clients had increased somewhat  for  foreign exchange and equity  derivatives.   Nearly one-third of  
dealers active in those markets reported  that the  volume of mark and collateral disputes  relating to  
credit derivatives, referencing  both corporate and securitized  products, increased somewhat.  
SECURITIES  FINANCING  
In contrast with  previous surveys, responses to questions focused on securities financing  
pointed to a tightening  of  some of the  terms under which all  specified types  of securities except  
equities were  financed.  The reported tightening  of terms over  the past  three months  was 
generally evident  for  both average and most -favored clients  and  was concentrated in higher  
haircuts and  wider  financing spreads over benchmark rates.    
Modest net fractions of survey  respondents  indicated  that demand for  funding of  
corporate bonds  (high  grade and high  yield)  as well as RMBS ( agency and non- agency ) had 
increased over  the past three months.   Indeed, notable net fractions  ranging from  one-fourth to 
nearly one-half  of  dealers reported  an increase in  demand for term funding with a  maturity of  
greater than 30 days for  high -grade corporate bonds and agency and non- agency  RMBS .  A 
smaller  net fraction  indicated  an increase in demand for term funding for high-yield corporate  
bonds.  By contrast,  a small sh are of  respondents pointed to a decline  in demand for funding of  
commercial mortgage- backed  securities (CMBS ).   
In contrast with recent surveys, respondents indicated that liquidity and functioning  of  all 
underlying asset markets covered by the survey (with the exception of equities)  had deteriorated 
over the past three months.6   Nearly two -thirds of respondents indicated a deterioration in markets  
trading high -yield corporate bonds  and CMBS, while  around one- third of dealers reported a 
decline in market l iquidity and functioning  with respect to high -grade corporate  bonds, RMBS, 
and consumer  asset -backed securities.  Modest portions of survey respondents reported an 
increase in the volume of mark and collateral disputes  related to non- agency RMBS and CMBS.     
6 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
market for the underlyin g collateral to be funded through repurchase agreements and similar secured 
financing transactions, not changes in the funding market itself.

SPECIAL  QUESTIONS ON FUNDING  OF U.S.  TREASURY SECURITIES  
To investigate the possible ramifications of the debt ceiling  debate and  the  subsequent  
U.S. sovereign downgrade  by S&P , a  set of special questions asked survey participants about  
conditions  in the market for  financing U.S. Treasury securities.  Despite the uncertainties 
surrounding the se events,  dealers  reported little change, over the  past three months, in terms  
under which U.S.  Treasury securities were funded  for both average and most- favored clients.  
About 15 percent of  respondents, on net, including two broad- scope dealers, reported an increase 
in demand for funding of U.S. Treasury securities.  A  similar net percentage reported a  
deterioration in  the liquidity and functioning of  the market for funding those  securities.    
SPECIAL  QUESTIONS ON CLIENT  RISK  APPETITE  
In light of the increase  in volatility and concurrent decline in  liquidity in some markets  
since June, a  second set of  special questions asked respondents to assess the current risk appetite 
of their clients of various types, relative both to three months  earlier  and to the start of 2011, 
considering activities across the entire range of  transactions included in t he survey.  Respondents  
indicated that their clients’  appetite to bear  risk had generally declined somewhat over the past  
three months for all types of clients.  T he most pronounced decreases were reported with respect  
to most-favored hedge funds and other hedge  funds, with nearly 40 percent and 50  percent of  
dealers, respectively, pointing to such  a decline.  Of note, a number of the broad- scope dealers 
reported  a decreased  risk appetite  for such clients .  For  other client  types, while  a small ne t 
fraction of dealers reported  a decrease,  the vast majority of respondents noted  that risk appetite  
had remained basically unchanged over the past  three  months .  A similar trend  in  risk appetite is  
visible over the longer horizon.  One- fifth of deale rs, with  respect to most -favored hedge fund 
clients, and one- third of dealers, with respect to other  hedge fund clients, reported  a decrease in  
risk appetite since  the beginning of 2011.  S mall net fraction s  of respondents indicated that, for  
other  client types , risk appetite ha d declined, although most dealers pointed to no change.  
SPECIAL  QUESTIONS  ON  USE OF  LEVERAGE BY  TRADING  REIT S  
Given that trading REITs have raised significant amounts of equity capital in  recent  
quarters and apparently represent  an import ant source of  demand  for  real estate–related assets,  the 
final set of special questions sought  information on  changes in  such REITs ’  use of leverage, both 
in the amounts deployed and the  types of assets being financed, since the beginning of the year.   
About one -fourth of survey respondents, on net, reported that use of leverage by trading REIT s  
had increased somewhat since the beginning of 2011.  Net fractions of respondents ranging from  
30 to 45  percent  noted that additional  funding capacity  was used primarily to finance purchases of  
agency pass-through securities  and agency  collateralized mortgage obligations .  Despite 
anecdotal reports  that s ome  trading  REITs  had reportedly begun warehousing  whole loans  for  
eventual securitization, survey responses d id not indicate  any increase in this sort of activity since  
the beginning of  the year.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS   
In this section, we consider several alternatives to our baseline projection using  
simulations of staff models.  In the  first scenario, we assume that the  economy is slipping  
into a recession, and the limited capacity of policymakers and the private sector  to buffer 
the downturn in spending cause what would otherwise be a modest retrenchment in 
activity to escalate into a major recession.   In the second scenario, the negative shocks  
that hit the economy in late 2010 and the first half  of 2011 are  assumed to dissipate more  
rapidly than in the baseline; as a result, real activity  snaps back more vigorously.  In the  
third scenario, we reinterpret the weakness in real  activity this  year as evidence that we 
have underestimated the  amount of damage that has occurred to the supply side of the  
economy, implying that there is currently less slack than assumed in the baseline  
forecast —something that policymakers are assumed to recognize only  gradually.  The  
fourth scenario builds on the previous one by assuming that this recognition lag a  nd the  
resulting delay in adjusting monetary policy cause longer-run inflation expectations to 
increase appreciably.  The final scenario considers the risk of a very severe recession in  
Europe, including significant financial spillover  effects to  the United States .  We generate 
the first four scenarios using the  FRB/US model and an estimated policy rule.  The last  
scenario is  generated using the multicountry SIGMA model, which uses a  different policy  
rule for the  federal funds  rate that  employs an  alternative concept of resource utilization.1  
Recession  
Some of the staff’s statistical models based on high frequency data suggest that  
the economy may be in the process of slipping into recession.  However, we assume that  
the downturn is deeper and more protracted than these models would predict because we  
believe that the economy is more fragile than these models judge.  In particular, we  
assume that some factors not adequately captured by these models, such as  the impaired 
balance sheets of m any households and financial institutions and the current constraint on 
1 In the simulations using the FRB/US model, the federal funds rate follows the outcome -based 
rule described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.  In the simulation using the SIGMA model, the 
policy rule is broadly similar, but it uses a measure of sl ack equal to the difference between actual output 
and the model ’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of a slow adjustment in 
wages and prices. In all the simulations, the Federal Reserve’s portfolio is assumed to follow the ba seline 
path.

fiscal and monetary policy, have made the economy  especially vulnerable to a vicious  
cycle in which falling c  onfidence, spending, and employment reinforce one another.  For  
these reaso ns, real  GDP contracts at  an average  annual rate of 2 percent through the end 
of next  year and the unemployment rate  rises to 1 1½ percent , considerably more than the  
statistical models predict.   Beyond 2012, the  economy  gradually  recovers but the  
unemploym ent rate still stands at 7  percent in late  2016.  The  greater economic slack in 
this scenario exerts substantial downward pressure on inflation, leading to a modest  
decline in consumer prices in 2014 and 2015.  Under these  conditions, the federal funds  
rate remains near zero through mid-2016.    
Faster Snapback  
In this scenario, the restraining effects of the adverse shocks that have hit the  
economy recently dissipate more rapidly than in the baseline, leading to a more robust  
recovery that is more in line  with those that typically follow other deep recessions.  Real  
GDP rises at an annual rate  of about 2¾ percent in the second half of this  year and   
3½ percent  on average  in 2012 and 2013, enough to bring the unemployment rate down 
to 7¼ percent by  the end of 2013 .   Initially, the stronger pace of the  recovery  has little  
effect on inflation because higher investment increases labor productivity  (thereby  
holding down unit labor  costs) and because long- run inflation expectations are well 
anchored.  In time, however, tighter labor  and product markets cause inflation to move up 
more than in the baseline.  Largely i n response to the stronger  pace of  real activity, the  
federal funds rate begins  to rise late this  year.  
Greater Supply-Side Damage  
A possible explanation for the disappointing pace of the recovery this  year  is that  
the supply side of the economy may have suffered  greater damage over the past several  
years than we have estimated.  For example, the NAIRU may have increased more 
because of problems related to mismatch  in the labor market, trend labor force  
participation may have declined more  as the weak job market led individuals to withdraw  
permanently from the labor force, and gains in structural multifactor productivity may  
have been slower than we think.  Because of these forces, the  current output gap in this  
scenario is only half  as large as in the baseline.  These conditions imply lower long-run 
levels of household income and corporate  earnings, and hence point to weaker  
consumption and investment, than in the baseline.  Accordingly, real GDP expands about  
¾ percentage point less rapidly per  year, on average, through 2016 than in the baseline

forecast, while inflation is higher because of both the direct effects of lower productivity  
on firms’ costs and a smaller  margin of slack.  Although policymakers are  assumed to 
recognize only  gradually  the less favorable supply-side conditions, the stability of   
long-run inflation expectations helps to keep inflation from rising above the assumed  
2 percent objective.   
Greater Supply -Side Damage with Higher Inflation Expectations  
In the previous scenario, we assumed that inflation expectations remained well  
anchored despite the fact  that policymakers are slow to recognize the full extent of the 
smaller margin of economic slac k and so keep monetary policy more  accommodative  
than they  would otherwise.  This scenario builds on the previous one by instead assuming  
that this delay in adjusting policy reduces the Federal Reserve’s credibility  and causes  
long- run inflation expectatio ns to move up to 3 percent by the end of next  year.  
Consequently, actual inflation rises considerably  more and remains persistently higher  
than in the preceding scenario; specifically, core PCE inflation moves above 2½ percent  
in 2013 and stays near that level through 2016.  In response to these more-inflationary  
conditions, monetary policy begins to firm in mid-2012.  The tighter stance of monetary  
policy in turn causes real GDP to expand somewhat more slowly than in the previous  
scenario, and the unemplo yment rate stays above 7  percent through 2016.  
Very Severe Financial Stress in  Europe  
In the baseline forecast,  we project that the European economies will expand at a 
subdued pace over the next two  years as financial  stresses remain  elevated  but generally  
contained.   In this scenario, we instead assume that financial difficulties intensify  
markedly in Spain and Italy, and that spillovers through trade, financial, and confidence  
channels are substantial  both in the core economies of Europe  and in the United States.   
Specifically, we assume that a worsening in investor sentiment causes European  
sovereign and private borrowing c  osts to soar, with European corporate bond spreads  
rising 400 basis points above baseline.  As  a result, European real GDP declines about   
8 percent  relative to baseline by the second half of 2012, notwithstanding a  nearly   
20 percent depreciation of the euro.  Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar, in 
turn, depress U.S. net exports.  In addition, our simulation assumes that U.S. corporate  
risk spreads rise  about 200 basis points above baseline.  Consequently, higher borrowing  
costs and declining stock prices restrain U.S. domestic demand.  All told, U.S. GDP  
contracts 1¼ percent in 2012, and the unemployment rate rises  above 10 percent.  Greater

resource slack, coupled with lower import prices, pushes core PCE inflation below   
¼ percent in 2012.  The federal  funds rate  remains near zero until mid-2015. 
OUTSIDE  FORECASTS  
In the September 10 survey, the Blue Chip consensus forecast for the  increase in  
real GDP  in the second half of this  year is about 2 percent  at an annual rate, slightly  
below the current staff projection.  The consensus  projection shows  real GDP  rising   
2½ percent in  2012, in line  with  the staff  projection.  The  Blue Chip forecast for the  
unemployment rate at the end of 2012 i s 8¾ percent,  the  same as the staff’s projection.  
Regarding inflation, the  Blue Chip panelists anticipate that the overall CPI  will  increas e  
3¼ percent over t he four  quarters of 2011 and 2 percent in 2012, in line with the staff  
projection in 2011, but almost 1 percentage point higher in 2012.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
