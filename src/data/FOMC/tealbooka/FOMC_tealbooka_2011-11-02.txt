Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The data on spending that have become  available during the intermeeting period 
have been somewhat stronger than we expected .  In particular, recen t readings on retail 
sales, capital goods orders and shipments, and nonresidential c onstruction have all 
surprised us to the upside.  However, impor tant indicators of near-term economic activity 
remain downbeat:  Measures of consumer sentiment are exceedingly low, business 
surveys point to continued caution, conditions in the labor market have not brightened,  
and gains in industrial producti on outside of the motor vehi cle supply chain have been 
sluggish.  Consequently, while the recent spen ding data led us to raise our projection 
about ¼ percentage point for real GDP growth in the second half of this year, to an 
annual rate of about 2½ percent, we have not  carried forward that positive revision into 
next year.   
Indeed, our medium-term projection for real activity is largely the same as in the 
September Tealbook.  The key conditioning fact ors shaping the forecast are not much 
different, on net, from our previous assump tions, and we think many of the factors that 
have been restraining the pace of the recovery—including the large overhang of vacant housing units, impaired credit availability, and el evated risk premiums—are still in place.  
We continue to expect the accommodative stance of monetary policy to eventually show  
through more forcefully to economic activ ity, as financial conditions improve and 
consumer and business confidence strengthen.  Bu t this progress is expected to be very 
gradual.  In all, we project real GDP to rise just 2½ percent in 2012 and to pick up to 
3¼ percent in 2013, similar to our projecti on in September.  Given the modest 
acceleration in real activity that we are projec ting, resource slack is expected to remain 
sizable.  The unemployment rate is projected  to fall to about 8 percent by the end of 
2013, but about half of the 1 percentage point decline from its current level reflects the 
expiration of the emergency unemployment benefit program.   
The trajectory of our inflation forecast  is little changed from the September 
Tealbook and continues to be shaped by our asse ssment that the upturn in core inflation 
this spring and summer stemmed largely from  transitory factors—most notably the pass-
through of the surge in commodity and import pr ices during the first half of the year.  
With commodity prices having pulled back fr om their peaks in the spring, we expect 
these pass-through pressures on consumer prices to continue to fade in coming quarters.

Thus, in an environment in which inflation expectations are anticipated to hold steady 
and slack in labor and product markets is expected  to remain substantia l, core inflation is 
projected to decline from about  1¾ percent this year to 1½ pe rcent next year and then to 
edge down slightly further in 2013.  With cons umer energy prices expected to fall into 
early next year and to rise only modestly thereafter, we project overall consumer price 
inflation to slow from around 2¾ percent this  year to about 1½ percent in both 2012 and 
2013. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
With little change to the staff’s outlook for real GDP, labor market conditions, 
and inflation, we continue to assume that  the FOMC will hold the target federal funds 
rate in the current range of 0 to ¼ percent until the third qua rter of 2014.  We also assume  
that the Committee will maintain its current portfolio-related policies.1    
Financial Conditions  
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities  has increased about 15 basis points, on 
net, since the September Tealbook.  Flight-to- safety demands have swung widely in both 
directions but, on balance, appear to have  eased a bit.  In response, we boosted our 
projection for the 10-year Treasu ry yield slightly in the near term.  Over the medium  
term, we continue to expect this yield to rise markedly, reflecting the movement of the  
valuation window through the period of near-zero short-term interest rates, a waning of 
the effects of nonconventional monetary pol icy, and a further unwinding of flight-to-
safety demands as the economic recovery gains firmer footing and concerns about the 
European situation gradually abate.  
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  have increased about 20 basis points, 
on net, since the September Tealbook, nudging up their spreads to comparable maturity 
Treasury securities by about 5 basis points.  Over the projection pe riod, we expect risk 
spreads to narrow gradually in response to slowly improving economic conditions,  
1 These policies include the reinvestment, until the first quarter of 2014, of principal payments 
from the FOMC’s Treasury holdings into Treasury secu rities as well as from its agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities into agency mortgage-backed securities.  The policies also include the 
purchase, by the end of June 2012, of $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturity of at least 
six years and the selling of an equa l amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturity of three years 
or less.

though not by enough to prevent the yields on these securities from increasing 
moderately.  Since the September Tealbook, interest rates on c onforming fixed-rate 
mortgages have changed little, on net, and th eir spreads to intermediate-term Treasury 
yields have narrowed somewhat.  Looking ahead, yields on conforming mortgages are 
projected to rise a bit less than yi elds on medium-term Treasury securities. 
The Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index increased more than we had 
projected in the Septem
ber Tealbook, leading us  to mark up the projected level of stock 
prices 1½ percent, on average, in 2012 and 2013.  We expect sh are prices to rise at an 
average annual rate of around 10 percent through the end of 2013, a pace that would help 
bring the equity premium down gr adually toward longer-run norms. 
According to the latest data from CoreLogic, existing home prices edged down in 
August, in line with the pr ojection in the September Tealbook.  Looking ahead, we 
expect house prices to decline slightly further next year before flattening out in 2013. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions ar e unchanged in this projection.2  As before, we 
expect federal fiscal policy to be a roughly neutral influence on aggregate demand in 
2011 but then to impose a drag of almost 1 percent of GDP per year in each of 2012 and 
2013, reflecting both the winding down of stim ulus-related policies and the additional 
fiscal restraint from the Budget Control Act. 
Our projection for the federal budget defi cit over the next two years is also 
essentially unchanged from the September Tealbook.  After ending fiscal year 2011 at 
$1.3 trillion (8½ percent of GDP) , the deficit is projected to slowly narrow to about 
$850 billion (5 percent of GDP) by fiscal 2013, reflecting the tighteni ng of fiscal policy 
and the boost to tax receipts from the continue d recovery.  Federal debt held by the public 
is projected to rise to about 73 per cent of GDP at the end of fiscal 2013.  
2 Consistent with the Budget Control Act, we assume that discretionary spending beginning in 
fiscal year 2012 will be re strained by the caps set in the act and th at additional measures will be put in place 
to reduce the budget deficit by $1.2 trillion in fiscal years 2013 through 2021.  Moreover, we assume that 
the current payroll tax reductions for employees will be allowed to expire at the end of this year and that 
the Congress will enact legislation to allow Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) benefits to be 
phased out over the course of 2012. (Absent such legislation, no new EUC recipients can be added after the 
end of this year and benefits for current recipients will run out near the middle of next year.)

Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
We expect that foreign real GDP will e xpand at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in 
the current quarter, down ¾ percentage point from the estimated third-quarter pace.  In 
part, the anticipated slowdown this quarter refl ects the fact that the bulk of the economic 
recovery from the effects of th e earlier disaster in Japan wa s accomplished last quarter.  
In addition, we expect that economic grow th in the European economies will remain 
considerably weaker than in most of our other trading partners, with euro-area GDP 
contracting slightly this qua rter and next.  By contra st, although export-dependent 
emerging market economies (EMEs) have seen some weakening in external demand, 
domestic demand should continue to support a m oderate pace of output growth there.  In 
the aggregate, the projection for foreign output  growth is down a bit from the September 
Tealbook.  Foreign real GDP is expected to incr ease at an annual rate  of about 3 percent 
next year and nearly 3½ pe rcent in 2013, as economic activity in the United States 
accelerates moderately and the euro -area economy recuperates.   
The dollar has appreciated amid continui ng concerns about the European debt 
crisis and the global economic outlook, boosting the starti ng point for our projection of 
the broad real dollar by about 1 percent relative to the September Tealbook.  We project 
that the dollar will depreciate at an average annual rate of  about 2¾ percent over the next 
two years, with most of that decline occurring against the currencies of the EMEs. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
 The spot price of West Texas Intermedia te (WTI) crude oil has risen about $5 per 
barrel since the time of the September Tealbook, in part re flecting reports of tighter 
domestic inventories.  On Oct ober 25, the spot price of WTI cl osed at $93 per barrel.  We  
anticipate that the pric e of WTI will gradually increase to  just under $96 per barrel by the 
end of the 2013, about $4 per barrel higher than  in the September Tealbook.  In contrast, 
the futures curve slopes downward to $89 pe r barrel by the end of 2013.  The difference 
between our projection and the futures curv e reflects both our expectation for dollar 
depreciation and a forecast for global growth  that is a touch more optimistic than the 
consensus among outside forecasters.  We raised  our forecast for the price of imported oil 
even more, so that at the end of 2013 it is about  $7 per barrel higher than in September.  
In recent months, the BEA’s price of importe d oil has been running higher than what we 
would ordinarily have expected given the pri ces of WTI and other t ypes of crude, and we 
have carried forward more of this differe ntial in the current forecast than we had 
previously.

Prices for most metals and agricultura l goods moved down sharply in the second 
half of September, likely reflecting concerns about th e outlook for global demand.  
Although prices rebounded somewhat in Octobe r, the broad index of nonfuel commodity 
prices that we follow is still about 6 percen t below the level at th e time of the September 
Tealbook.  We project that nonfue l commodity prices will increa se at an annual rate of 
about 3½ percent through 2013.  As with oil pr ices, our forecast is a touch higher than 
that implied by quotes from futures markets. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
The recent data on final sales have been stronger than we expected, with upward 
surprises notched in household spending, investment in equipment and software (E&S), 
and nonresidential construction.  However, ava ilable data on inventor y investment point 
to less accumulation that we had expected.  On balance, our estimate of the growth of real 
GDP in the third quarter, at 2¾ percent, is a bout ¼ percentage point stronger than in the 
September Tealbook.  The recent upside surprises also imply somewhat faster growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter; as a resu lt, we have boosted our forecast ½ percentage  
point to 2½ percent.
3  
The Labor Market  
Labor market conditions continue to di sappoint.  Private payrolls increased 
92,000 in September (after adjusting for the return to work of 45,000 Verizon workers 
who had been on strike during the August re ference period for the payroll survey) and 
rose an average of about 120,000 per month over the third quarter  as a whole, down 
somewhat from the average pace in the second quarter.  Meanwhile, government 
employment continued to decline last quarter , with employment in the state and local 
sector falling about 20,000 per month.  Job gains in recent months have been insufficient 
to bring down the unemployment rate, which has been essentially flat since May at a bit 
above 9 percent.   
3 We now estimate that the drag on production from the Japan-related disruptions to global supply 
chains subtracted about ½ percentage  point from real GDP growth in the second quarte r, and that the 
rebound from those disruptions added about ¾ percentage point to GDP growth in the third quarter and will 
add another ¼ percentage point in the current quarter. These effects are slightly smaller in magnitude than 
in the September Tealbook.  The GDP contributions through the end of this year are, on net, positive, as automakers not only attempt to achieve previous production levels but also endeavor to make up a portion 
of the lost production; as the pace of  this make-up slows in early 2012 and ends by the middle of the year, 
the effects become a small drag on  the growth rate of GDP.

Other labor market indicators  continue to point to tepid gains in employment in 
coming months.  Although initia l claims for unemployment insurance have fallen slightly 
in recent weeks, job openings and help-wan ted advertising have edged lower in recent 
months.  In all, we expect that privat e payroll employment will increase about 120,000 
per month this quarter, the same pace as in  the third quarter.  With state and local 
governments expected to make further cuts to  payrolls in response to budget pressures, 
total payroll employment in the fourth quarter is expect ed to increase a little under 
100,000 per month.  In light of these modest gains in em ployment, we expect the 
unemployment rate to remain  a little above 9 percent th rough the end of the year.  
The Industrial Sector  
Manufacturing production rose at an a nnual rate of 4¼ percent in the third 
quarter, largely reflecting a ramp-up in pr oduction along the motor vehicle supply chain 
following the earthquake-related disruptions earlier in the year.  Most manufacturers 
affected by the earthquake—both at home and abroad—have returned to roughly pre-earthquake rates of production, and some firms are attempting to further boost output in 
order to make up for production that was lost due to the supply chain interruptions.  In 
particular, with automobile dealers’ inve ntories still lean, we expect motor vehicle 
production to step up noticeably further this qua rter.  In contrast, the underlying pace of 
activity outside the motor vehicle sector ha s remained sluggish in recent months.  
Moreover, national and regional business surv eys have remained soft, on balance, and 
suggest little impetus to production outside moto r vehicles in the near term.  All told, we  
expect manufacturing output to  rise 4½ percent this quart er, about ½ percentage point 
faster than the September Tealbook, but to slow to more modest rates of increase in early 
2012. 
Household Spending  
The pace of consumer spending appears to have picked up in the third quarter.  
With the easing of the supply shortages indu ced by the Japan earthquake, motor vehicle 
sales rebounded appreciably, on net, during the summer, and sale s are expected to remain 
near their September pace in coming months.  Spending appears to have risen briskly 
recently in other categories as well:  The part  of nominal retail sales that the BEA uses in 
estimating PCE increased 0.6 percent in September—a much larger gain than we anticipated—and the figure for August was revi sed up noticeably.  As a result, we now 
estimate that real PCE increased at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the third quarter, about 
½ percentage point above the September Tealbo ok forecast.  Still, th e very low level of

sentiment, the earlier declines in the stock ma rket, and the tepid gains in employment and 
income projected for the coming months contin ue to weigh on consumer spending.  As a 
result, although the most recent retail sales da ta caused us to mark up our fourth-quarter 
projection by about 1 percentage point, we still look for real PC E to increase at a 
relatively modest pace of 2 percent.  (S ee the box “Consumer Sentiment and Consumer  
Spending” for further discussion.) 
In the market for single-family homes, activity remains at levels only modestly 
above the lows plumbed in the wake of the recession.  Recent data on starts and permits, 
as well as on home sales, have continued to  portray a sector generally moving sideways 
since early 2010.  With a host of factors c ontinuing to weigh on ho me construction, we 
expect single-family housing star ts to hold steady at an annu al rate of 430,000 units in the 
fourth quarter, a level similar to our projection in the September Tealbook.  By contrast, 
multifamily starts are expected to increase in coming months (albeit from still-low 
levels), with activity spurred by increase d demand for apartments, which has already 
pushed down vacancy rates for these structures  and boosted rental prices.  All told, we 
now estimate that residential investment edged up in the third quarter and will post 
another modest increase in the current quarter.  
Business Investment  
Recent data on shipments suggest that real investment in E&S rose about 
12½ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, faster than the 7½ percent increase 
recorded in the first half of  the year and likewise consider ably faster than the pace 
expected in the September Tealbook.  However, gains of this size are not expected to 
persist:  Business sentiment remains subdued, an alysts’ earnings exp ectations for capital 
goods producers have softened noticeably sin ce earlier in the year , and corporate bond 
spreads have remained elevated.  Accordingl y, we expect spending gains to slow to an 
annual rate of about 3¾ percen t this quarter, similar to our  projection in the September 
Tealbook. 
After factoring in the latest monthly c onstruction data, we estimate that real 
outlays for nonresidential structures (other th an those for drilling and mining) rose at an 
annual rate of 16 percent in the third quarter , similar to the increas e posted in the second 
quarter and considerably faster than we expected in th e September Tealbook.  These 
gains have been widespread across sectors.   Nonetheless, vacancy rates remain high, 
prices of commercial real estate are still lo w, financing conditions are likely to remain

difficult, and the architectural billings index, which is a useful leading indicator of  
building activity, points to a decline in outlays in the next several quarters.  As a result, 
we expect spending outside drilling and mining structures to fall nearly 10 percent this 
quarter.  By contrast, investment in drilling and mining structures will likely move up 
further over the near term, boosted by the pro liferation of new technologies that render 
drilling profitable at a wider ra nge of sites as well as by the continued high level of oil 
prices.  
The pace of inventory investment outside the motor vehicle sector stepped down 
in July and August, and we expect stockbuild ing to slow further in coming months as 
businesses work to keep inventories in better alignment with sales.  Then again, with 
dealers’ stocks of motor vehicles still fair ly lean following the supply problems induced 
by the earthquake in Japan, we expect automa kers to rebuild inventories through the end 
of the year.   
Government  
Incoming data suggest that real federa l purchases fell mode stly in the third 
quarter, reflecting a decline in nondefense pur chases and little change in defense 
purchases.  We expect federal purchases to move up in the current quarter as defense 
expenditures rise toward a level more c onsistent with appropriated funding.   
Meanwhile, recent declines in real expe nditures by state and local governments 
appear to have been somewhat smaller than expected in the September Tealbook.  In 
particular, the pace of job loss in July a nd August was revised down somewhat in the 
latest employment report, while real construction spending now appears to have risen 
modestly in the third quarter, in contrast to our expectation of a further decline.  
Nonetheless, the budgets of these governments remain strained:  Tax collections at the 
state level have been rising more quickly in recent quarters, but fe deral stimulus grants 
are being phased out and local tax collections have been quite  weak, reflecting the earlier 
collapse in property values.  Accordingly, we continue to expect real state and local 
government purchases to move down further in the fourth quarter. 
Foreign Trade  
In light of an unexpectedly weak reading for August, we now estimate that real 
exports of goods and services in the third qua rter as a whole rose at an annual rate of 
6 percent, about 3½ percentage  points less than we an ticipated in the September

Consumer  Sentiment  and  Consumer  Spending  
Measures   of  consumer   sentiment   play  an  important  role  in  the  Board  staff  forecast  of  consumption   
because  they  have  some  incremental   predictive  power  for  household   spending,  even   when   other  
conventional   determinants   (such  as  wealth,   income,  and  interest  rates)  are  taken  into  account.   One  
hypothesis   for  why  they  have   such   power  is  that  they  may  be  capturing   factors—such   as  expectations   of  
and  uncertainty   about  future  income  and  wealth—that   are  difficult   to  measure  directly  but  likely   
significantly   influence   consumer   spending.    For  example,   the  weakening   in  consumption   at  the  onset  of  
recessions   is  likely  due  not  only  to  already  experienced   changes  in  income  and  wealth,  but  also  to  
changes  in  households’   expectations   of  future  income  and  wealth.   As  shown  in  the  lower‐ left  figure,  a  
diffusion  index  of  households’   expectations   of  real  income  growth  from  the  Michigan   survey  often  drops  
at  the  beginning   of  recessions,  as  does  an  index  of  households’   expectations   of  their  future  financial  
situations   (not  shown).   In  addition,  for  many  households,  uncertainty   about   future  labor   income  likely   
rises   during  recessions,  increasing   precautionary   saving  and  further  damping  spending.   One  measure  of  
this  uncertainty—the  perceived  probability   of  losing  one’s  job  in  the  next  few  years—jumped   in  the  past  
two  recessions   (see  lower‐right  figure).    
The  staff   monitors   several  different  measures   of  households’  assessments   of  current  and  future  
economic   conditions,   all  of  which  tend  to  move  together.   One  measure  we  often  highlight  is  the  
Michigan   survey’s  composite  index  of  consumer   sentiment,   shown  in  the  top  figure  on  the  facing  page.   
The  figure  shows  that  sentiment  has  experienced  several  sharp   declines  during  the  past  30  years,  some  of  
which  are  marked  with  vertical  lines.   These  movements   are  often,  but  not  always,  followed  by  a  
weakening   in  economic   activity.   For  example,  in  mid‐1990,  late  2000,  late  2007,  and  September  2008,  
sharp  drops  in  sentiment  anticipated   or  coincided   with  the  onset  or  intensification   of  recessions.   In  other  
cases—the  stock  market  crash  of  1987  and  Hurricane  Katrina—sentiment  declined  noticeably,  but  activity  
did  not  weaken  significantly,  and  any  effect  on  consumption   was  relatively  short  lived.          
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
 
In  July  and  August  of  this  year,  sentiment  declined  sharply,  likely  reflecting   anxiety  about  the  possibility   
that  the  economy   was  slipping  back  into  recession,  as  well  as  heightened   concerns   about  financial  market  
stability—stemming,  in  large  part,  from  sovereign  debt  problems  in  Europe—and  increased  doubts  that

government   policy  would  address   important   economic   problems.   Indeed,  responses   to  the  Michigan  
survey  show  that  households’   views  of  government   economic   policy  dropped  sharply  over  the  summer,  
and  the  preliminary   reading  for  October   was  at  an  all‐time  low  (see  figure  below).    
In  our  forecast,  we  expect   weak  sentiment  to  weigh  on  consumer   spending   in  the  near   term.   But  over  
time—as   information   accumulates   that  the  economy,   while  weak,  is  not  deteriorating   further,  and  that  
policymakers   in  the  United  States  and  Europe  are  addressing   concerns   about  fiscal  sustainability   and  
financial  stability—we  expect  that  sentiment  will  move  back  up  from  its  recent  lows,  albeit  only  to  levels  
that  are  still  relatively   weak  historically.    This  projected   increase  in  consumer   sentiment   contributes   to  our  
expectation   that  consumer   spending   will  accelerate   next  year.

Tealbook.  We expect export growth to pick up to a 7½ percent pace in fourth quarter— 
about the same as in the September projection—supported by past dol lar depreciation and 
continued growth in foreign demand.  Real imports are estimated to have risen just 
2¼ percent in the third quarter, less than previo usly projected, as a decline in real imports 
of oil partially offset a bounceback in automotive imports following the earthquake-
related disruptions earlier in th e year.  We expect import growth  to pick up to 5 percent in 
the fourth quarter, in part as  real imports of oil rebound.   
We estimate that the external sector adde d about ½ percentage point at an annual 
rate to real GDP growth in the third quarter , a bit more than expected in the September 
Tealbook.  By contrast, we look for net exports to make only a small positive 
contribution to growth in the fourth quarter as import growth steps up a bit more than in 
the previous Tealbook. 
Prices and Wages  
Recent data on overall consumer prices have  come in close to our expectations, on 
net, and the contour of our n ear-term projection is essentially  the same as our September 
forecast.  Total PCE price inflation is projecte d to slow from an annual rate of 3½ percent 
in the first half of this year to 1¾ percent in the second half as energy prices turn down 
after their first-half surge, and both food pr ices and core prices  rise somewhat less 
quickly. 
With regard to core consumer prices, we continue to think that the faster pace of 
inflation evident in the spring and summer was mainly due to transito ry factors, including 
the pass-through of the first-half upswing in commodity and import prices as well as a boost to motor vehicle prices that stemmed from post-earthquake supply shortages.  
Indeed, the prices of new motor vehicles ha ve decelerated noticeably, and apparel prices, 
which had moved up sharply during the first half  of this year in response to a surge in 
cotton prices, turned back down in September and helped hold the rise in the core CPI in 
that month to less than 0.1 pe rcent.  As the slackening in  commodity and import prices 
since the spring further passes into prices of  final goods, core PCE inflation should slow 
from an annual rate of a little more than 2 percent in the second and third quarters to 
1½ percent in the fourth quarter. 
After moving up rapidly in the first half of the year, consumer energy prices 
decelerated considerably in the third quarter , and they are projected  to decline in the

fourth quarter.  While this contour mainly re flects the rise and subsequent reversal in 
crude oil prices, the d eceleration in retail energy prices has been attenuated somewhat by 
unusual supply conditions.  (See the box “Why Haven’t Gasoline Prices Fallen as Much 
as Oil Prices?” for further di scussion.)  PCE food pr ice increases also slowed in the third 
quarter, though to a still-elevated annual rate  of 4¾ percent.  We expect a further step-
down in food price inflation in  the fourth quarter as declines in crop prices since the 
spring begin to show through to the retail level.   
Based on the available data, we estimate that compensation per hour increased at 
an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the third quart er, and we are looking for a similar rate of 
increase in the fourth quarter.  This rate of increase would be a marked slowing from the 
4 percent pace recorded in the first half of the year, when compensation appears to have 
been boosted by a sharp step-up in bonuses.  
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
The fact that the recent data on house hold and business spending have been 
somewhat stronger than we expected has given us a little more confidence in our view 
that the economy is not currently slipping back  into a recession.  Bu t indicators of labor 
market conditions and consumer and business confidence are tepid at  best, and industrial 
activity outside the motor vehicle supply ch ain remains sluggish.  Moreover, events of 
the intermeeting period underscored the still-vulne rable nature of the financial system.  In 
light of these considerations, we have take n little signal from the incoming spending data 
about the broader thrust of economic activity.  Thus, we continue to expect that real 
activity will firm only gradually over the next two years.  In  particular, we project that, 
after increasing 1¾ percent this year, real GDP growth will step up to 2½ percent next year and to about 3¼ percent in  2013, leaving its le vel little changed from our previous 
projection.   
The projected pace of recovery remains qui te disappointing relati ve to historical 
experience, even taking into account that th e recession was sparked by a financial crisis 
and was of unusually long duration.  We expect  this disappointing performance to persist, 
notwithstanding the substantial stimulus being provided by monetary policy.  Among 
other factors, the oversupply of houses and commercial structures  shows little sign of 
abating in the near term; stat e and especially local governme nts appear likely to remain 
under substantial budgetary pressu re in the near term as pr operty-tax collections remain 
weak and federal support is withdrawn; and households and businesses look likely to

Why  Haven’t   Gasoline  Prices  Fallen  as  Much  as  Oil  Prices?    
In  recent  months,  gasoline  prices  have  not  fallen  as  much   as  would  typically  be  expected   given  
the  decline  in  the  main  domestic   benchmark   grade  of  oil  prices:   Since  April,   the  spot  price  of  
West  Texas  Intermediate  (WTI)  crude  oil  has  fallen  nearly  $20  per  barrel  (or  48  cents  per  gallon),  
while  retail   gasoline  prices  have  declined  only  about  15  cents  per  gallon.   The  failure  of  gasoline   
prices  to  respond  as  much  as  usual  this  year  to  the  decline  in  the  price  of  WTI  likely  reflects  a  
confluence  of  factors:   First,  owing  to  segmentation  in  the  domestic  market  for  crude  oil  and  
the  sudden  availability   of  more  oil  in  the  midsection  of  the  country,  the  recent  decline  in  the  
price  of  WTI  overstates   the  fall  in  average  crude  input  prices  faced  by  domestic  refiners.   
Second,  localized  capacity  constraints   in  the  refining  sector   have  limited  the  pass‐through  of  
lower  average  crude  input  prices  into  gasoline  prices.   We  anticipate  that  these  factors  will  
persist,  and  so  are  forecasting   that  the  price  of  gasoline   will  remain  high  relative  to  the  price  of  
domestic  crude  over  the  forecast  horizon.   
Over  the  past  year  or  so,  unusual  divergences  between  the  prices  of  different  types  of  crude  oil  
have  emerged.   As  shown  in  the  lower‐ left  figure,  the  typical  close  co‐movement  in  the  spot  
prices  of  WTI  and  Brent,  another  important  benchmark   crude,  has  broken  down.   Since  April,  
the  price  of  WTI  has  fallen  much  more  than  Brent,  largely  reflecting   continued   increases   in  the  
supply  of  oil,  primarily  from  Canada  and  North  Dakota,  that  is  available  to  flow  into  Cushing,  
Oklahoma—the  delivery  point  for  the  futures  contract  on  WTI  crude  oil.   The  existing  
infrastructure   is  insufficient  to  fully  integrate  this  region  to  global  markets.   As  a  result,  the  
influx  of  additional  landlocked   crude  has  depressed  the  price  of  oil  in  the  Midwest  relative  to  
the  rest  of  the  country,  where  refiners  are  more  reliant  on  seaborne  crude.

Unlike  the  market  for  crude  oil,  the  U.S.  gasoline  market  is  relatively   well  integrated,  and  there   
is  little  dispersion   in  wholesale  or  retail   gasoline  prices  across  the  country  (other  than  those  due  
to  tax  differentials   and  environmental   regulations   in  certain   metropolitan  areas).   With  common   
output  prices  for  gasoline,   refineries   in  the  Midwest,   with  access  to  cheaper  WTI‐ priced  crudes,  
have  enjoyed  sharp  increases   in  profit  margins  (the  red  line  in  the  lower‐left  figure  below),  
whereas  refineries   in  other  regions  that  rely  more  heavily  on  higher  priced  seaborne   crude,  such   
as  the  East  Coast  (the  blue  line),  have  margins  more  in  line  with   historical  averages.      
Normally,   one  would  expect   refineries   with   high  margins  to  boost   production,   resulting  in  an  
increase  in  gasoline  supply  and   a  decline  in  national  gasoline  prices.   However,  as  shown  in  the  
lower‐ right  figure,  refineries   in  the  Midwest  have  been  producing   at  utilization  rates  as  high  as  
they  ever  sustain,  and  thus  are  unable  to  increase  output  in  the  near  term.   Therefore,  refineries   
outside  the  Midwest  are  the  marginal   producers   at  present,  and  with  their  margins  near  
historical   norms,  these  refineries   have  little  or  no  incentive  to  boost  production.    Indeed,  
capacity  utilization  for  refineries  on  the  East  Coast  has  fallen  over  the  past  year  to  low  levels.      
Going  forward,  we  expect  the  price  of  seaborne  crude  oil  (including   Brent)  to  decline  only  
slightly  over  the  forecast  period  (lower‐left  figure  on  the  facing  page).   The  price  of  WTI  is  
expected   to  move  up  gradually  toward  Brent’s  level  as  improvements   in  transp ortation  
infrastructure   reduce  the  Midwest’s  relative  supply  glut  by  more  closely  linking  landlocked  WTI  
crude  to  global  markets.   Accordingly,  input  costs  for  noncapacity ‐constrained   refineries  outside  
the  Midwest  should  stay  high,  and  we  project  that  retail  gasoline  prices  will  therefore  remain  in  
the  vicinity  of  their  current  levels  (lower‐right  figure  on  the  facing  page).

remain relatively pessimistic in the face of   persistently weak employment growth, 
ongoing turmoil in the financial sector, and unsettling news from Europe.   
Consistent with previous projections, we continu e to assume the current settings 
of the monetary policy dials are probably de livering less support for aggregate demand 
than might be expected based on historical norms.  Residential cons truction provides the 
clearest example of the phenomenon.  As has been the case for some time, the prevalence 
of underwater mortgages combined with tight lending standards are preventing many 
households from taking advantage of historically low mortgage rates.4  Similarly, tight 
credit for builders is limiting the supply res ponse to such demand as there may be for new 
homes.  In addition, households’ uncertainty about their future income and employment 
prospects, concerns about the direction of house prices, and the large inventory of vacant 
single-family homes on the market (which s uggests increases in housing demand will be 
satisfied by existing structur es) continue to weigh on hous ing construction.  While we 
expect the drag from many of these factors to diminish over time, albeit slowly, we do 
not expect credit conditions to improve ma terially.  As a resu lt, despite the high 
affordability of housing for many potential buyers, single-family housing starts are 
projected to move up to an annual rate of 560,000 units by the end of 2013—only 
140,000 units higher than recent readings and fa r below the pace we think is consistent 
with the longer-run demand for housing.   
Similarly, we see few prospects for an appreciable gain in business spending on 
nonresidential structures over the medium te rm.  The headwinds facing this sector—such 
as high vacancy rates, low property prices, and difficult financing conditions—have not 
diminished materially, nor do we expect them to do so in coming quarters.  Thus, although business spending on stru ctures is reported to have picked up in the middle 
quarters of this year, we expect spending to resume its downward trajectory in 2012 and 
then to flatten out at an extr emely depressed level through 2013. 
We expect the forces that curren tly are restraining household spending— 
depressed confidence, poor employment and income expectations, the lingering effects of 
earlier declines in household wealth, and di minished access to credit—to gradually ease 
as the economic recovery proceeds.  Indeed, access to consumer credit already seems to 
4 We anticipate that an increase in mortgage refinancing spurred by the recently announced 
changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program will add only very slightly to household spending 
growth over the coming quarters.

be improving—for example, many households are now able to use credit to buy motor 
vehicles, and credit card solic itations have picked up marked ly for those with high credit 
scores.  All told, we expect growth in r eal PCE to pick up to 2½ percent in 2012 and 
3 percent in 2013, about the same as the September forecast and a pace that keeps the 
saving rate roughly flat over the medium term. 
The level of investment in equipment a nd software has been running only a little 
above the replacement level and, as a result, the growth rate of the capital stock is quite 
low by historical standards.  Although many firms are flush with cash and have ready 
access to capital markets, allowing them to take advantage of low interest rates and 
increase spending for profitable investments,  capital expenditures are likely being held 
back by a heightened degree of uncertainty.  However, as the recovery proceeds and 
uncertainty about its durability diminishes, we expect business conf idence will rise and 
businesses will be more willing to undertake increases in their productive capacity.  All 
told, we anticipate that real outlays for equi pment and software will increase 5¼ percent 
in 2012 and 6¾ percent in 2013.   
We also expect continued restraint from  the government sector.  Given our fiscal 
assumptions, we anticipate federal purchases to  decline modestly in 2012 and then to fall 
4 percent in 2013 as discretionary spending is restrained by the caps in the Budget 
Control Act and spending related to overseas mi litary operations is assumed to decline.  
With state and local budgets expected to re main tight, purchases by those jurisdictions 
should be about flat over the course of 2012 and 2013.  Our projection for state and local 
purchases reflects modest increases in tax re ceipts—limited by the moderate expansion in 
economic activity and the damping effect of  past house price depr eciation on property 
taxes—but also the phasing out of stimulus-related federal paym ents and restrained levels 
of regular federal grants. 
Finally, although we revised down our forecas t for U.S. exports in this projection 
because of the higher assumed path for the dol lar, real exports are nonetheless supported 
by the downward tilt in the dollar going forward and by con tinued foreign growth; we 
expect that real exports will increase 6¾ percent in both 2012 and 2013.  Real imports are 
projected to increase just 3¾ percent in 2012, held back by both the modest gains in 
activity in the United States and the deprecia tion of the dollar, before picking up to a 
5 percent pace in 2013, as U.S. GDP accelerates.  All told, the external sector is projected

to add ¼ percentage point to GDP growth in 2012 and to make a smaller positive 
contribution in 2013.  
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR  MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU  
Our projections of aggregate supply are largely unchanged from the September 
Tealbook.  We continue to assume that potential GDP will increase about 2 percent in  
both 2011 and 2012 and then accelerate slightly to 2¼ percent in 2013, as a pickup in the 
pace of capital deepening boosts structural la bor productivity growth a bit.  The NAIRU 
is assumed stay at 6 percent through 2013.5   
Productivity and the Labor Market 
After edging down in the firs t half of this ye ar, labor productivity seems to have 
risen briskly in the third quarter.  We expect it to increase  a bit further this quarter, 
leaving the level of productivity  somewhat above our estimate of its trend.  We expect 
that the gap between actual labor productivity and its stru ctural level will narrow over 
projection period as increased confidence in the durability of the recovery gradually 
induces firms to increase their staffing to more sustainable levels.  Consequently, the 
gains in productivity over the next two years are projected to be a bit less than trend.  
As the forecast for real GDP growth in 2012 and 2013 is little revised in this 
projection, so is the path of employment.  We expect the pace of em ployment growth to 
pick up moderately over the medium term, refl ecting the gradual acceleration in output as 
well as the additional hiring induced by impr oving business confidence.  After averaging 
monthly gains of about 140,000 this year, privat e employment is projected to rise about 
175,000 per month in 2012 and to quicken to  220,000 per month in 2013.  Meanwhile, 
state and local employment is projected to  decline further in 2012, though by less than in 
recent years, and to rise modestly in 2013, as budget pressures diminish somewhat. 
Because employment gains are not much different from the September forecast, 
the unemployment rate projection is similarly li ttle changed.  The jobl ess rate is expected 
5 Our estimate of the “effective” NAIRU, which includes the influence of extended and emergency 
unemployment benefits and is the level of the unemploymen t rate that we view as being consistent with no 
slack in resource utilization, is unrevised from the September projection and is about 6½ percent at present.  
We expect the gap between the effective NAIRU and th e traditional NAIRU to essentially disappear by the 
end of 2012 when the extended and emergency unemployment benefit programs wind down.

to edge down to about 8½ percent by the end of 2012, though this decline mainly stems 
from marginal workers leaving the la bor force as extended and emergency 
unemployment benefits are phased out rather th an from a material improvement in labor 
market conditions.  We expect the unemployment rate to fall further in 2013 to about 
8 percent, as GDP increases enough to narrow the GDP gap somewhat and the pace of 
hiring picks up. 
Resource Utilization 
The modest recoveries in output and empl oyment are expected to whittle away 
only very slowly at the curren tly high margins of economic sl ack.  The level of real GDP 
is expected to be nearly 6 percent below its po tential level at the end of this year and still 
to be 4¾ percent below potential at the e nd of 2013.  The unemployment rate gap closes 
similarly slowly:  The jobless rate in the four th quarter of this year  is expected to be 
2½ percentage points above our estimate of the effective NAIRU, and the gap is still 
2 percentage points at the end of 2013.  This  extended period of labor market slack is 
likely to be associated with a continuation of  other adverse aspects of the labor market 
seen during this episode, including below-trend labor force participation, a high percentage of workers who are involuntar ily on part-time schedules, and an unusually 
large concentration of workers experien cing long-duration un employment spells. 
The margin of unused plant capacity in the industrial sector should be taken up 
more rapidly than the slack in  the economy as a whole, in  part because manufacturing 
capacity has expanded only very slowly since the recession and is proj ected to rise just  
1 percent in 2012 and 1½ percen t in 2013, rates of increase c onsiderably below those of 
potential GDP.  As a result, at the end of 2013, our projection calls for the factory 
operating rate to be only a bit below its l ong-run average despite the still-sizable GDP 
gap prevailing at that time. 
Prices and Compensation  
Our current forecast for core PCE inflation over the four  quarters of 2011—at 
1¾ percent—is about the same as in the Se ptember Tealbook.  None theless, it is about 
¾ percentage point above our forecast as of the beginning of this year.  About one-half of 
this upward revision reflects changes in our conditioning assumptions, including unexpected increases in energy prices and import prices.  In the baseline, we assume that 
the bulk of the remainder of the surprise owes  to the pass-through to core prices from the 
sharp run-up in commodity prices having been gr eater than we expected as of a year ago.  
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
 
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
October 26, 2011
Page 27 of 108
Authorized for Public Release
Consistent with that hypothesis, upward revi sions to our forecast for inflation of core 
goods prices—that is, the prices  that are more likely to be affected by changes in 
commodity and import prices—account for more than one-half of the cumulative upward 
revision to overall core PCE inflation this ye ar despite the fact that core goods account 
for only one-fourth of the core PCE price i ndex.  Thus, we continue to expect the 
downturn in commodity prices to show th rough to core prices in coming quarters. 
Another possibility for the sequential upward revi sions in  our inflation forecast is 
that the margin of slack in resource utiliza tion is narrower than we  have assumed and so 
is putting less downward pressure on inflati on than we had expected.  However, the 
various labor market indicator s that we reference while as sessing our assumption for the 
NAIRU—such as the rate of permanent job lo ss, shifts in the Beveridge curve, and 
unemployment-to-employment tr ansition rates—do not  suggest a higher NAIRU than we 
have assumed.  Nonetheless, we could be  wrong about the NAIRU; we explore the 
implications of that possibility in an alte rnative scenario in th e Risks and Uncertainty 
section. 
The influence of the downturn in commodity  prices in the middle of the year can 
be readily seen in the price index for core intermediate goods, which decelerated from an annual rate of increase of 8 percent in the thr ee months ending in June to just 1 percent in 
the three months ending in September.  The in fluence of commodity prices is also evident 
in the price index for core imports, whic h excludes fuels but includes many other raw 
commodities and goods at intermediate stages  of production.  Prices of imported core 
goods are estimated to have decelerated to an  annual rate of less th an 3 percent in the 
third quarter after increasing at a rate of nearly 8 percent in the first half of the year.  
Moreover, factoring in more-recent declines in nonfuel commodity prices and the recent 
appreciation of the dollar, we expect that core import prices will be about flat in the 
current quarter and in the first quarter of next  year.  Over the remainder of the projection 
period, core import price inflation is expected to run at about a 1¾ percent pace as commodity prices remain relatively flat a nd the dollar depreciates only modestly.   
Various indicators suggest inflation expect ations remain subdued.  In particular, 
median 5- to 10-year-ahead expected infla tion in the preliminary Michigan survey in 
October was 2.7 percent, down 0.2 percentage point from the September reading and at 
the lower end of the range seen  over the past several years.  The TIPS-based measures of 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook

inflation compensation are little changed since the September Tealbook and are near the 
low end of their ranges over the past year. 
Putting it all together, the medium-term projection for core inflation is little 
revised in this forecast.  As noted ab
ove, the transitory pressures that have boosted 
inflation this year—namely, the pass through of earlier increases in commodity, import, 
and energy prices—are expected to fade in coming quarters.  In addition, the ongoing 
wide margin of slack should continue to  limit upward pressures on prices in an 
environment in which inflation expectations remain stable.  All told, we expect core 
inflation to decrease from 1¾ percent this y ear to 1½ percent next year and to move down 
slightly further in 2013.  With energy prices ex pected to be about flat  next year, total PCE 
inflation is expected to be a little below core inflation in 2012 and then to run at about the same pace as core inflation in 2013.  
Given the appreciable amount of labor market  slack persisting in our forecast, as 
well as the low rates of price inflation, we expect labor costs to remain subdued over the 
projection period.  In particular, both th e Productivity and Cost measure of nonfarm  
hourly compensation and the employment cost  index are projected to rise about 
2¼ percent per year in 2012 and 2013.  Co mbined with the moderate gains in 
productivity that we project, these increases in compensation imply only a small rise in 
unit labor costs.  
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2016 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assessments of long-run supply- side conditions, fisc al policy, and other factors.  The 
contour of the long-run outlook depe nds on the following key assumptions: 
  Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long run, 
consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections provided by 
FOMC participants at the June meeting. 
  The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities follow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B.  The projected longer-run decline in the 
System’s holdings is forecast to contribut e about 30 basis points to the rise in 
the 10-year Treasury yi eld from 2013 to 2016.

  Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds decline gradually to normal 
levels, and banks ease their lendi ng standards some
what further. 
  The federal government budget deficit (N IPA basis) narrows from 5 percent 
of GDP in 2013 to about 4 percent of GDP  in 2016.  This narrowing reflects 
both the effects of the economic r ecovery on tax receipts and budgetary 
restraint consistent with the Budget Control Act that wa s passed during the 
summer. 
  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to decline 1½ percent 
per year from 2014 to 2016.  The price of  WTI crude oil is roughly flat at 
around $95 per barrel during the extension period.  Foreign real GDP expands, 
on average, 3½ percent per year fr om 2014 through 2016, slightly above its 
trend rate.  
  The NAIRU declines from 6 percent in  late 2013 to 5¼ percent in late 2016 
as the functioning of the labor market  gradually improves.  Potential GDP 
expands 2½ percent per year on average from 2014 to 2016. 
The economy enters 2014 with  output still considerably  below its potential, the 
unemployment rate well above the projected NAIRU, and inflation below the assumed 
objective.  In the long-run forecast, improvi ng confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and 
supportive financial conditions enable real GDP to rise at an average annual rate of 
3¾ percent from 2014 to 2016.  With actual outpu t expanding faster th an potential, labor 
market conditions improve; nevertheless, the unemployment rate, at 6 percent at the end 
of 2016, is still ¾ percentage point a bove the assumed NAIRU.  With downward 
pressures from slack on unit labor costs grad ually abating after 2013, inflation edges up 
to 1.6 percent by 2016.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign economic  growth is estimated  to have picked up by more than  
1 percentage point to just over 3½ percent in the third quarter, in line with our  
expectations  and  largely  reflecting the fading of  the disr uptions to production and supply  
chains that followed the Japanese disaster .  However, recent data suggest that the 
underlying pace of expansion remains subdued, and with the effect of the bounceback 
diminishing, we see foreign  GDP  growth slackening to 2¾ percent in the current quarter, 
down about ¼ percentage point  from  the September Tealbook .   
The downward revision has been most pronounced for the  euro area, where 
economic activity  is being hurt  by fiscal con solidation , volatile financial conditions, and 
declining c  onsumer and business confidence.  We continue to assume that  European 
authorities will reach  agreement on measures to avert a full -blown financial crisis, but  
even so, financial and economic conditions in the region probably will  remain strained 
for some time.   The weakness in the European economies, along with modest  GDP  
growth in the United States, is likely to constrain  activity  in other advanced foreign  
economies  (AFEs) as well as in emerging market  economies  (EMEs) .  We expect  foreign  
growt h to average around 3 percent next  year, and then to pick up to nearly  3½ percent in 
2013, as  financial stresses abate and the U.S. economy improves.  This outlook is  a little  
lower than in the previous Tealbook.  
Foreign inflation remains contained, althou gh recent rates in the advanced  
economies have not declined quite as much as  we had expected, as  the boost from  
previous energy  price increases is fading more slowly than anticipated.  We continue to 
expect inflation abroad to average a bit below 2½  percen t over the next two  years,  down 
from 3¼  percent this  year, as  pressure from  earlier  run-ups in commodity prices  
diminishes  and  resource slack persists .  Some central banks in  advanced economies  
loosened policy during the intermeeting period, and we expect some further easing goi  ng  
forward .  In EMEs , a few  central banks have begun to ease policy in response to concerns  
about weakening  external demand .   
The outlook, especially for Europe, remains  highly uncert ain as  we await the 
results of today’s (October 2 6) summit of European leaders.  These officials continue to 
wrestle with the terms of  a Greek debt restructuring , the recapitalization of European

banks, and the  especially difficult issue of how to provide a credible backstop for  the 
larger vulnerable eco nomies.  (S ee the box “Recent Policy  Developments in the Euro  
Area” for  additional information).  In the absence of  an overarching solution to the  
region’s fiscal problems , any number of shocks  could trigger  a financial crisis of  
sufficient intensity to plunge  economies throughout the world into recession.  (See the 
“European Crisis with Severe Spillovers” scenario in the Risks and Uncertaint y section.)  
ADVANCED FOREIGN  ECONOMIES  
We estimate that r eal  GDP  growth in the  AFEs  rebounded from  near  zero in  the 
second quarter to about 2¼ percent in  the third quarter, as supply  chain disruptions from  
the Japanese earthquake  were largely resolved .  However, weak  recent indicators suggest  
that growth will step back down to a 1 ½ percent pace in the fourth quarter .  We expect  
growth to remain  around that  rate in 2012 and to pick up to just above 2 percent in 2013, 
a somewhat  weaker  outlook than in the September Tealbook.   
The largest downward revision has been for the  euro area,  reflecting  both recent  
disappointing  data as  well as  indications that banks are tightening lending standards.  We 
now expect economic activity in  the euro area to contract  slightly  this quarter and next, 
and we see a  greater risk that lackluster  growth in the United Kingdom  also  could turn 
into a  recession.   Elsewhere, the story is less bleak, and we have revised up our near- term 
outlook for  economic activity in Canada, partly in response to a surp risingly resilient 
labor market.  The Japanese economy  appears to have rebounded sharply in the third 
quarter, but we expect  growth to return to a more  subdued pace in the  current quarter.  
AFE inflation  declined from a recent peak of 3¼ percent in the  first quarter  to just  
above 1 percent in the third quarter.  This pa ce was a little higher than  we had expected , 
as  retail energy prices have fallen less  quickly  than anticipated .  With flat commodity  
prices and substantial output gaps, AFE inflation  should remain  subdued over the  
remainder of the forecast period .  Faced  with elevated financial stresses and a soft  
outlook, the European Central Bank (ECB)  announced a series of measures to boost  
liquidity and the Bank of England (BOE) expanded the size of its quantitative easing  
program.  We expect both central banks to ease monetary policy further over the  coming  
year.

Euro Area  
The fiscal and  financial turmoil in the euro area remain s  the most important  
influence on the outlook both in Europe and beyond.  Our baseline still assumes that 
European policymakers  will a vert a wider  financial crisis , although the re is a substantial  
risk that they will miscalculate and do too little, too late .  In any case, w e continue to 
expect financial conditions to remain strained for  quite some time . 
We estimate that real GDP rose only about 1 percent in the third quarter, as  
industrial production picked up in July and August but consumption indicators continued to disappoint and labor market conditions remained poor.  R ecent  indicators suggest that  
growth will be  much  weaker this quarter .  Business and consumer  confidence declined 
sharply  for the third consecutive month in September, while the composite  PMI entered 
contractionary territory in September and fell further in October.  Moreover, a ccording to  
the ECB’s  latest bank lending survey, euro-area banks  have reduced credit  availability as  
funding pressures  have increased.   In response to the worsening conditions , we marked  
down euro- area output growth a full  percentage point  over the next three quarters and  
somewhat less over the rest of the forecast period.  We now expect G DP to  contract  
slightly in the current quarter  and next before  edging up to an anemic 1½ percent pace in  
2013 as financial stresses gradually diminish. 
Twelve-month e uro-area inflation  rose to 3 percent in September, although third -
quarter inflation at  an annual rate dropped to about 1¼ percent .  However, the latter  rate 
was somewhat higher than in the September Tealbook, as recent declines in energy prices  
have passed through to the consumer level somewhat more slowly than we had expected .  
Amid sizable  resource slack , we  expect inflation to  remain near that rate in 2012 and to 
pick up to 1¾ percent in 2013.  The ECB did not cut rates at its October meeting, but it announced a series of  measures to provide liquidity, including  a €40 billion  covered bond  
purchase program  and 12-month refinancing operations in October and December.  Given 
the weaker outlook for  growth and inflation, we  now expect the ECB  to cut its main  
refinancing  rate 50 basis points  by early 2012 to 1 percent.  
Japan  
Real GDP snapped back in the third quarter, rising  at  an estimated  6¾ percent  
rate, as  a faster -than-expected  resolution of supply  chain disruptions led to a surge in 
exports.  However, more- recent data s  uggest that the recovery lost some momentum  
toward the end of the summer.  In S eptember , auto registrations tumbled after re bounding

October 26, 2011Over the intermeeting period, European leaders intensified their efforts to find a 
comprehensive solution to the fiscal and financial stresses plaguing the euro 
area. A long‐delayed aid disbursement to Greece was approved by European 
leaders, and national parliaments fully ratified increases in the effective capacity 
and flexibility of the euro‐area financial backstop, the European Financial Stability 
Facility (EFSF), that leaders had negotiated in July. In addition, policymakers 
focused on making progress on three issues: restructuring Greece’s debt to pave 
the way for a second loan package, shoring up European banks against losses on 
sovereign holdings, and building a larger financial backstop for the other 
vulnerable euro‐area countries. Although acknowledging the urgency of the 
situation, policymakers have had difficulty coalescing around solutions. Leaders 
of the European Union (EU) are meeting today (October 26) and have made early 
announcements about plans to shore up European banks. Additional decisions 
regarding Greece’s debt and the financia l backstop are expected later today. 
EU leaders recently approved their part of an €8 billion disbursement to Greece 
from its original EU‐IMF loan package, which should enable the country to avoid 
near‐term default, but if Greece is to meet its sizable debt service obligations 
going forward, agreement is urgently needed on the enhanced EU‐IMF loan 
package announced by leaders in July. Complicating matters, disappointing 
growth and fiscal performance since July suggest that Greece’s prospects for 
repaying its debt have deteriorated, increasing the need for more aggressive 
debt restructuring than was proposed in the summer. Recognizing this need, 
euro‐area leaders are now in discussions with private creditors over larger 
“haircuts” on private creditors’ claims than the 21 percent envisaged in the 
summer, possibly as high as 50 to 60 percent. These negotiations have 
reportedly been tense, and it is unclear whether a haircut of this size could be 
structured to avoid a credit event. 
Larger haircuts would reduce Greece’s crushing debt burden, but would also put 
further pressure on Europe’s already beleaguered banks and raise the risk of 
contagion to other vulnerable sovereigns. In response, euro‐area leaders have 
taken steps to address the loss of confidence in the European banking sector, 
including providing more details today on recapitalization plans. In July, the 
European Banking Authority’s (EBA) 2011 stress tests—which were based on a 
core Tier 1 capital ratio benchmark of 5 percent and did not severely stress banks’ 
Page 40 of 108
Authorized for Public Release
sovereign  exposures—identified   a  total  capital  shortfall  of  only  €2.5  billion.   The  
EBA  is  conducting   a  follow‐up  review  of  banks’  capital  needs  using  a  higher  
9  percent  core  Tier  1  capital  ratio  benchmark   and  writing  down  exposures   to  
stressed  sovereigns   based   on  market  values  on  September  30,  2011.   Most  market  
estimates   of  the  capital  shortfall  range  from  €100  billion  to  €200  billion,  with  
indications   that  the  EBA  figure  is  likely   to  be  toward   the  bottom  of  that  range.   
Once  the  EBA  has  made  its  assessments,  EU  leaders  announced   today  that  banks  
will  be  given  until  the  end  of  June  2012  to  raise  capital  privately,  after  which  
national  governments   will  be  called  upon  to  inject  funds  into  them,  financed  by  
the  EFSF,  if  necessary.    In  addition,  European   leaders  agreed  on  the  need  for  
coordinated   guarantees   of  bank  liabilities  to  reduce  banks’  considerable  funding  
risk  in  the  current  fragile  financial  environment.    
Euro‐ area  leaders  are  also  working  on  constructing   a  more   credible  firewall  for  
the  larger  vulnerable  countries.    The  recently  ratified  changes  to  the  EFSF  
increase  its  effective  lending  capacity  to  €440  billion.   However,   this  capacity  falls  
well  short  of  market   estimates   of  the  figure   needed  to  backstop   Spain  and  Italy  
should  they  come  under  funding  pressur e.   Given  political  opposition   within  
northern   European  countries   to  further  increasing   the  size  of  the  EFSF,  European  
leaders  have  considered   a  range  of  strategies   to  leverage  existing  EFSF  funds  to  
channel  a  much  larger  amount  of  financing   to  vulnerable   governments.    Leaders  
reportedly   are  supporting   two  options,  one  in  which  the  EFSF  bonds  would  be  
lent  to  collateralize   guarant ees  of  newly  issued  sovereign   debt  and  another  
where  the  EFSF  would  provide  capital  for  a  special  purpose  vehicle   designed   to  
combine  private  and  public  funds  to  purchase   sovereign   debt.   However,   
challenging   legal  and  technical   issues  remain  unresolved,   and  it  is  uncertain   that  
these  partial  guarantees   will  be  sufficient   to  convincingly   backstop   the  
vulnerable   countries.

through August, and the  manufacturing PMI fell into contractionary territory  for the first  
time  since March.   In addition, a third supplementary budget, which is needed to fund 
reconstruction activities, has  been delayed .  All told,  we have lowered our projection for  
fourth -quarter  GDP  growth by more than 1 percentage point to 2¼ percent.   GDP  growth  
is expected to average 2  percent  in 2012, supported by reconstruction activity, and then to 
slow to 1½ percent in 2013.   
We estimate that quarterly  inf lation turned slightly positive in the third quarter.  
However, the increase in  prices was led b y a temporary jump in food prices, while  core 
prices , excluding a  ll food and energy items, edged down.  Accordingly, we  project  
deflation to  resume in the current quarter  and to persist  at a rate of negative ¼ percent  
through 2013.  W e continue to expect the Bank of Japan to keep  policy on hold over the  
forecast period.  
Canada  
We estimate that Canadian GDP is rebounding a  bit more strongly  from its  
second -quarter slump than we had anticipated.   The PMI  for manufacturing t  icked up to a  
solid 55 in September , and trade data point to a large  contribution to GDP growth from  
exports in the third quarter.  Moreover, the labor  market appears especially  robust, with 
full-time employment advancing through September.   All told, we see Canadian GDP  
growth registering  2½ percent in the second half  of this  year before slowing to 
2¼ percent on  average in  2012 and 2013.   
Inflation  dipped to 1 percent in the third quarter, from an average of 3¼ percent in 
the first half of the  year, reflecting both declines in energy prices and a transitory plunge  
in car prices .  Going forward, inflation should bounce back to around 2 percent.  W e 
continue to expect the Bank of Canada  to maintain its main policy  rate  at 1  percent  
through early 2013.  
United Kingdom  
Recent  revisions  to th e U.K. national accounts showed that the  economy  
expanded at a m  eager 1 percent pace in the  first half of 2011, as consumption contracted 
while investment remained close to its recession trough.   Although much of that  
weakness reflected  temporary factors,  notably the Royal Wedding holiday  and parts  
shortages at automobile  plants, r ecent  indicators show little evidence of  a bounceback in 
activity.  The  composite PMI stood barely  above  50 in September, and average

employment from June to August fell more than ½ percent  relative to the  previous three-
month period.  In response  to these data and the weaker  euro-area outlook, we have 
lowered our  forecast  for the second half of 2011 more than  ½ percentage point, to 
1¼ percent.    
Growth is projected to pick up to 1¾ percent in 2012 and to 2½ percent in 2013, 
suppor
ted by  additional monetary easing.  Faced with  renewed fi nancial stresses and  a 
deteriorating outlook, the BOE announced a £75 b illion (5 percent of GDP) expansion of  
its quantitative easing program in early October that will bring total asset holdings to  
£275 billio n (19 percent  of GDP) upon its completion in early  February 2012.  We 
believe the B OE is likely to boost asset purchases  by another £50 billion by the middle of  
2012 and keep the  Bank Rate at 50 basis points over the forecast horizon. 
The B OE’s decision to implement further quantitative easing  was made even  
though U.K. inflation is running well above the  BOE’s 2 percent target;  12-month 
headline inflation rose to  5.2 percent in September  due to sharp hikes in electricity  and 
gas tariffs.   On  a quarter -to-quarter  basis,  we expect  inflation  to move down from  
3¼ percent  at an annual rate in the third quarter to near 2 percent in 2012 and 2013 as  
energy prices flatten out  and resource slack remains substantial.    
EMERGING MARKET  ECONOMIES  
In the EMEs, we estimate that aggregate real GDP  growth stepped up to nearly  
5 percent  in the third quarter, about unchanged from the September Tealbook projection, 
as stronger- than-expected economic  growth in China  was  offset  by weaker act ivity in  
some other countries.  Although the underlying pace of expansion in the EMEs  appears to  
have slowed from above- trend rates, we project that real GDP will rise  at a rate of  about  
4¼ percent in the  current quarter  and about 4½ percent  next  year.   Slower economic  
growth in the advanced economies  likely  will continue to weigh on external demand, but  
the EMEs appear to still have significant momentum in their domestic  spending.  By 
2013, firming  recovery in the advanced economies should help economic  growth in the  
EMEs step up to a trend- like pace of 4¾ percent.   The  forecast  over the next several  
quarters  is revised down  a little  from the previous  Tealbook, owing to weaker external  
demand .   
Headline inflation in the  EMEs  came in at an  annual rate of 4¾  percent in the 
third quarter, about  as  projected  in the September  Tealbook.  W e expect  inflation  to fal l

to 3½ percent  in the current quarter  as supply- related  spikes in food prices  unwind and to 
step down further to about 3¼ percent  over the next two years.  The moderation of  
inflation in recent months, along with greater uncertainty  about  global economic  
prospects, has prompted some central banks  (for example , Brazil, Indonesia, and 
Singapore) to loosen policy.   
Heightened concerns over risks in the global  economy and financial markets have  
led to sharp pullbacks from EME assets, as evi denced by  large capital outflows from  
EME-dedicated investor  funds .  These pullbacks have raised concerns about funding and 
financial stability  and also have put significant downward pressure on some EME 
exchange rates.  In response, a number of countries intervened in the foreign exchange  
markets in September  to support the value of their currencies.  Lately, however, these 
pressures  appear to have abated  as  global investor  sentiment has improved a bit .  
China     
Chinese real GDP expanded at an annual rate of 9½ percent in the third quarter, 
about 1½ percentage points higher than anticipated in  the September Tealbook.  
Domestic demand remains robust, with real retail  sales up more than 10 percent from  a  
year earlier  and fixed -asset investment posting  25 percent  growth.  In contrast, exports  
fell modestly while  imports  rose , resulting in  a narrowing of the trade surplus in the third 
quarter.  Recent data suggest that Chinese domestic demand  is stronger than we 
previously thought, but  weaker prospects for Europe  are expected  to have a restraining  
effect  on external demand.  Balancing these co  mpeting forces , our forecast  for Chinese  
GDP growth for the  current quarter is  a bit stronger at  8½ percent  and for the remainder 
of the forecast period is little changed  at about 8¼  percent.  
Chinese headline consumer price inflation moved a bit higher in the third quarter  
to an annual rate of 6¼ percent , largely as  a result  of supply- related  increases in food 
prices.  As these pressures abate,  inflation should fall to jus t over 3 percent in the current  
quarter and average  a bit under 3 percent over the  next two years.   
On October 11, t he U.S. Senate passed the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight  
Reform Act of 2011, which calls for specific  actions to be taken by the U.S. government  
against countries that are  found to keep their  currencies persistently undervalued.  The  
bill has not come up for a vote in the House.  At this point, w e do not  expect these 
developments to have a  material effect on  the outlook for Chinese exchange  rates.  We

continue to project a  gradual appreciation of the renminbi both against the dollar and on a  
real trade-weighted basis over the forecast period.  
Other Emerging Asia  
Elsewhere in  emerging Asia,  we estimate that the pace of  economic activity  
picked up in the third quarter to 4½ percent, supported by  a boost from Japan’s recovery, 
including the restoration of supply chains.  This estimate is down a bit from the previous  
Tealbook projection;  recent data on  exports and industrial production were surpr isingly  
strong for some countries, including Korea and Thailand, but in other countries, notably  
Taiwan and Singapore, data surprised on the downside.  As the boost from Japan’s  
recovery wanes, the region’s economic  growth is projected to fall back to 3½ percent in  
the current quarter, before rising gr  adually to nearly 5 percent by the  end of 2013.  This  
projection is  down a little from  the September Tealbook , reflecting in part  more 
pronounced weakness in Europe.  
Inflation in  the region has dropped back appreciably from  a peak near 7 percent in  
the first quarter of this  year to an annual rate of 3½ percent in the third quarter.  We 
expect it to remain around that pace in the  current quarter  and to step down a bit more 
over the  remainder of the forecast peri od.  T he general downward trend in inflation in 
recent quarters , along with  concerns  about the strength of the  global  economy, prompted 
central banks to loosen monetary policy in Indonesia and Singapore, while  most other  
central banks  refrained  from tighte ning.  In India, however, where inflationary pressures  
persist, the central bank raised its monetary policy rate  25 basis points  at each of its  past  
two meetings .  
Latin America  
Recent indicators suggest that Mexican real GDP  growth  edged down to a  still-
strong 4 percent in the third quarter, supported by  a rebound in auto production.  
However, we  expect growth to slow somewhat to an average pace of  about 3¼ percent  
over the forecast period, in line with the contour of U.S. manufacturing output, and down 
a bit from the September  Tealbook forecast.  
Real  GDP in South America appears to have moderated to 3 percent in the   
third quarter, ½ percentage point lower than we had expected, largely  reflecting  weakness  
in the Brazil ian economy.  In recent months, the PMI  readings for Brazilian  
manufacturing have moved down sharply into the  contractionary range, and exports have

fallen .  Accordingly, we  have marked down our  estimate  for Brazil’s economic growth  
by 1 percentage point to 2¼ percent in the third quarter.  Thereafter, we expect Brazilian  
growth to pick up gradually to 4 percent by the end of 2013.   
After having dipped to 2½ percent in the second quarter, h eadline inflation  in 
Latin America  picked back up to an annual rate of 3½ percent in the third quarter, as a 
temporary energy subsidy  in Mexico ended .  We  expect inflation to average roughly  
3¾ percent over the forecast period.  
Reflecting concerns about the strength of the economy, t he B razilian  central bank 
lowered the policy  rate  another 50 basis points  at  its most recent  meeting, even though at  
7.1 percent in early October,  12-month inflation is still running above the  6½  percent  
upper limit of its  target range.  The  Bank of Mexico, which has not tightened monetary  
policy since  before the  global financial crisis, signaled at its  latest  meeting that it might 
loosen policy further.

Financial Developments 
Financial markets were volatile over the intermeeting period, but market 
sentiment improved in recent weeks as investors apparently saw promise in the extended 
discussions regarding steps to contain the Eu ropean fiscal and banking crisis.  The more 
positive tone in financial markets was reinforc ed by economic data releases that were, on 
balance, somewhat better than market partic ipants had expected.  Consistent with those 
developments and probably some easing of flight-to-safety demands, Treasury yields generally moved higher, on net, over the intermeeting period amid some downward 
pressure on long-term Treasury rates from  the FOMC’s announcement of the maturity 
extension program (MEP).  Inflation compensation edged up and the expected path of the federal funds rate also increased some, on ne t, over the period.  Corporate yields for 
investment-grade issuers rose  about in line with  those on comparable-maturity Treasury 
securities.  In contrast, speculative-grade corporate yields decrease d, on balance, leaving 
their spreads notably lower.  Broad indexes of U.S. equity prices increased, on net, as 
stronger-than-expected third-qua rter earnings reports added to  the overall improvement in 
sentiment.  Implied volatility on the S&P 500 index remained elevated.  In the euro area, 
stock prices swung in a wide range but ended the period hi gher, while spreads on most 
peripheral sovereign bonds remained quite el evated.  The dollar was little changed on 
balance. 
The most recent data on credit flows in the United States have been mixed. 
Issuance of investment-grade bonds by nonfin ancial corporations slowed some in 
October from its robust September pace, a nd issuance of high-y ield bonds remained 
weak.  In contrast, both nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding and C&I loans have increased briskly thus far in October, and conditions in the institutional leveraged loan 
market reportedly have improved some.  In the household sector, consumer credit 
declined in August, while ne ar-record-low interest rates on conforming home mortgages 
continued to elicit on ly modest refinancing activity.  In the third quarter, bank loans 
registered their first quarter ly increase since the fourth quarter of 2008, but the October 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) suggested 
little net change in lending standards or overall loan demand over the past three months.  
In September and October, M2 slowed markedly following its surge earlier in the summer.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Yields on longer-dated nominal Treasury securities declined notably following 
the release of the September FOMC statemen t, while those on shorter-dated Treasury 
securities rose slightly.  Although widely anticipated, the MEP was apparently somewhat 
larger in scale, and the distribution of pur chases by maturity was skewed a bit more 
toward the long end of the curv e, than some market particip ants had expected.  The rise 
in shorter-term Treasury yields was reportedly driven to some  extent by the prospect of 
sales of shorter-term securities under the ME P as well as by the FOMC’s decision not to 
reduce the interest rate paid on reserves.  L onger-term yields declined  further in the wake 
of the announcement, reportedly in response to the Committee’s assessment of the 
economic outlook, which was seen as more nega tive than previously thought.  Investors 
also seemed to pay particular note to the statement’s indication of significant downside 
risks to the outlook.  Option-adjusted spread s of yields on current-coupon and other low-
coupon agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) over those on comparable-duration 
Treasury securities narrowed after the a nnouncement of the Committee’s decision to  
reinvest principal payments on agency debt  and agency MBS securities into new MBS 
rather than longer-term Treasury securities.1    
Over the following weeks, 2- and 10-year Treasury yields were volatile but rose, 
on balance, and ended the period higher by about 10 basis points and 20 basis points, 
respectively, as investors’ seemingly fa vorable assessment of the ongoing efforts to 
contain the European crisis appeared to trigger some reversal of fli ght-to-safety flows.  
Treasury yields were also boosted by U.S. economic data that were somewhat stronger than expected.  The yield on 30-year Treasur y bonds fell about 10 basis points over the 
period, leaving the long end of th e Treasury yield curve somewhat  flatter.  Market reports 
indicate that liquidity in the Treasury mark et has remained stable since the introduction 
of the MEP; the Open Market Desk’s purchase operations were well received, and sales  
of shorter-term securities me t with very robust demand.  In addition, option-adjusted 
spreads of yields on current-coupon and other low-coupon agency MBS ended the 
1 Gauging the response of MBS spreads to the FOMC announcement depends importantly on the 
MBS spread employed.  The commonly quoted “curre nt coupon” MBS spread presently captures the 
behavior of both the 3 percent and 3.5 percent coupon se curities, and the former is quite illiquid.  Based on 
the current-coupon series, MBS spreads dropped only a few basis points following the FOMC 
announcement.  However, the drop in MBS spreads based on just the 3.5 percent coupon securities—the 
most actively traded securities and most closely connected to current production of mortgages—was 
considerably larger at about 20 basis points.

intermeeting period somewhat lower, on net, than they had been before the announced 
change in the reinvestment program  after the September FOMC meeting. 
Over the intermeeting period as a whole, the m ean path of the expected federal 
funds rate over the next four years moved up appreciably.  This path rises above the 
current target range in the third quarter of 2013, one quarter earlier than at the time of the 
September FOMC meeting.2  The modal path for the federal funds rate derived from  
interest rate caps also shifte d up some and now suggests that market participants think the 
federal funds rate is most likely to first rise  above the current target range in the second 
quarter of 2014.  (See the box “Expected Time  and Pace of Tightening.”)  However, 
measures of policy uncer tainty also appear to have ri sen over the intermeeting period, 
suggesting that these increases may in part ha ve been driven by highe r term premiums.   
Results from the Desk’s latest survey of  primary dealers suggested that there was 
no overall change in the expected path of  policy through the fourth quarter of 2013.  
However, the mass of the probability distributi on of the expected quarter of the first rate 
liftoff shifted somewhat to the right, with more than half of the respondents now 
expecting that tightening would not commence until the first quarter of 2014 or later.  
Most respondents did not antici pate major changes in the lan guage of the statement at the 
upcoming FOMC meeting, although a few deal ers saw some chance that the Committee 
would make changes in its forward guidance with respect to the federal funds rate.  Dealers revised up their forecasts for real  GDP in 2011 on average; however, many noted 
that heightened uncertainty and concerns about Europe continued to weigh on their 
outlooks.  Meanwhile, there was little change to the dealers’ forecasts of near-term core 
PCE inflation or longer-term headline CPI inflation. 
Indicators of inflation expectations  posted small mixed changes over the 
intermeeting period.  TIPS-based inflation co mpensation over the next 5 years increased 
about 15 basis points, on net, reportedly due in  part to the rise in commodity prices.  
However, forward inflation compensation 5 to  10 years ahead was little changed, on net, 
over the intermeeting period.  Both measures re main close to their lows for the year.  
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 7 basi s points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4.3 basis points.  The Desk purchased a total of $41 billion of 
Treasury securities during the intermeeting period and sold a total of $28 billion of Treasury securities 
under the FOMC’s MEP.  In addition,  it purchased $1 billion in Treasu ry securities with  the proceeds of 
principal payments on its holdings of agency securitie s before shifting reinvestment into agency MBS, of 
which it purchased $19 billion.

Swaps-based readings on inflation compensation moved about in line with their TIPS 
counterparts.  In contrast, measures of short- and long-term infla tion expectations from 
the Michigan survey decreased slightly over the period.  
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING  MARKETS  
Credit default swap (CDS) spreads and equity prices of large U.S. banking 
organizations were again volatile over th e intermeeting period.   Bank CDS spreads 
spiked in early October, reflecting in part concerns about the expos ures of some U.S. 
firms to Europe and about the consequences fo r the broader financial system of a possible 
“stress event.”  Investor sentiment improved in  recent weeks amid discussions of plans to 
address pressures on euro-area sovereigns and recapitalize European banks.  In addition, 
third-quarter U.S. bank earnings reports rele ased in mid-October, while mixed, avoided 
large negative surprises and reportedly eased concerns of investor s about the size of 
European exposures at the reporting institutions.  Partly as a result, CDS spreads for U.S. 
banking firms retraced a large portion of their previous increases, and bank equity prices 
rose 3½ percent, on net, over the intermeeting period,  a little more than the broader 
market.  
In short-term bank funding markets over the period, U.S.-chartered financial 
institutions had little need for funding, while European institutions continued to face 
strained conditions.  The three-month Libor–OIS  spread widened a bit further, as did the 
spread between a three-month forward rate agreement and the OIS rate three to six 
months ahead, apparently reflecting continue d strained funding conditions for European 
banks.  The cost of dollar funding for euro-ar ea financial institutions implied by FX basis 
swaps declined but remained at high levels.  However, there were no reports of 
significant pressures related to funding over year-end.   
Negotiable certificates of deposit and unsecured commercial  paper outstanding 
from many European banks, especially Fren ch banks, fell further, and the average 
maturity of such paper remains below that of domestic issuers.  The amount of AA-rated 
asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) outst anding has also drifted down for programs 
with European sponsors; spreads of rates on such paper relative to those on AA-rated 
nonfinancial paper remained elevated.  U. S. money market mutual funds and other 
investors continued to cut their exposures to  French entities in September.  Direct 
exposures of money funds to Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Ire land were essentially 
zero.

Expected   Time  and  Pace  of  Tightening  
In  recent  FOMC  statements,   the  Committee  has  provided   forward  guidance   concerning   the  period  
over   which  the  federal  funds  rate  is  expected   to  remain  at  exceptionally   low  levels.   Investors’  
expectations   of  the  date  on  which  tightening   will  begin  and  the  anticipated   trajectory   of  the  
federal  funds  rate  once  tightening   is  under  way  are  two   important   elements   influencing   the  level  of  
intermediate‐term   rates.    Market   expectations   concerning   these   two  factors  can  be  inferred  from  
the  daily  OIS  curve  with   the  help  of  a  simple  model  of  policy  expectations.1    
In  that  model,  the  policy  paths  are  limited  to  those   where  the  target  federal   funds  rate  remains  at  
its  current  level   until  the  beginning   of  tightening,   and  the  target   is  then  raised  at  a  constant  pace   
over   time.   The  timing  of  the  date  of  first  tightening   is  uncertain  and  assumed  to  follow  a  standard   
statistical   distribution.   The  model’s  parameters   are  estimated   each  day  to  fit  the  observed   policy  
path   implied  by  futures  quotes  on  that  day.   By  imposing   this  structure  on  the  assumed   path  of  
policy  expectations,   one  can  estimate   the  expected   timing  of  tightening   (plotted  in  the  top  figure  
on  the  facing  page)   and  the  expected   pace  of  tightening   conditional   on  tightening   having  begun   
(plotted  in  the  bottom  figure  on  the  facing  page).   The  model   also  generates   a  probability   
distribution   around  the  expected   date   of  the  onset  of  tightening,   and  the  standard  deviation   of  this  
distribution   can  be  used  as  a  measure  of  the  uncertainty   about  the  timing  of  first  policy  tightening   
(shown   in  the  middle  figure  on  the  facing  page).    
As  the  figures  show,  these  three   measures   appear  to  vary  in  response  to  changes  in  investors’  
assessment  of  the  economic   outlook  and  to  FOMC  communications.    As  assessments   of  the  U.S.  
and  global  economic   outlo ok  deteriorated   beginning   in  the  second  quarter  of  both   2010  and  2011,  
investors   expected   tightening   to  begin  later  and  to  proceed   at  a  slower   pace;  in  addition,   
uncertainty   about  the  date  of  tightening   increased.    Following   the  FOMC  announcements   
regarding   large‐scale  asset  purchase   (LSAP)   programs   in  March   2009  and  November   2010,   
respectively,   the  expected   pace  of  tightening   trende d  higher,  perhaps  reflecting   market  
participants’   more  optimistic   assessment   of  the  economic   outlook;  the  expected   time  until  
tightening   and  the  associated   uncertainty   declined  following   the  announcement   of  the  second  
LSAP.    
More  recently,   over   the  months  leading  up  to  the  September  FOMC  meeting,   the  expected   time  
until  tighteni ng  lengthened   and  uncertainty   about  the  date   of  the  onset   of  policy  tightening   spiked  
as  the  European  debt  crisis  worsened   and  the  economic   outlook  deteriorated   again,  while  the  
expected   pace  of  tightening   hovered  at  around  7  basis  points  per  month.   That  pace  of  tightening   
is  rather  slow   by  historical   standards;  during  the  1994  and  2004  tightening   episodes,  for  example,  
the  federal  funds  rate  was  raised   at  an  average  pace  of  25  and  18  basis  points   per  month,  
respectively.   In  the  past  few  weeks,  however,  the  expected   date  of  tightening   has  moved  a  bit  
closer  and  uncertainty  has  declined  slightly  amid  some  improvement  in  investor  sentiment  related  
to  developments  in  Europe  and  somewhat  better‐than‐expected  U.S.  economic   data  releases.

FOREIGN  DEVELOPMENTS  
Over the intermeeting period, foreign fi nancial markets remained volatile and 
widespread funding pressures persisted.  Howe ver, investor sentiment improved a bit, on 
net, as concerns about the European sove reign debt crisis eased somewhat.  Although 
euro-area officials remained divided regarding proposals to leverage  the funds available 
to the European Financial Stability Facil ity and to recapitalize European banks, global 
investors seemed heartened that European leaders were attempting to face these 
challenges more directly (see the box “Recent Policy Developments in the Euro Area” in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section).  After falling sharply in 
August and early September, equity prices in  the euro area outperformed those in most 
other economies over the intermeeting peri od.  German and U.K. 10-year benchmark 
sovereign yields increased a bout 25 basis points a nd about 10 basis points, respectively.  
Some reversal of safe-haven flows led the dol lar to give back in October most of the 
gains it had registered in late September,  leaving the broad nominal foreign exchange 
value of the dollar little cha nged compared with its level at the time of the September 
FOMC meeting.  
Despite the somewhat more positive sen timent, spreads of 10-year sovereign 
bonds of most vulnerable euro-area countries over German bunds were little changed, on 
net, over the intermeeting period.  European funding markets also remained under 
pressure.  Dexia, a Belgian and French bank, en tered into a plan with  national regulators 
to nationalize some of its operations and sell off others.  The European Central Bank 
(ECB), the Bank of England (BOE), and th e Swiss National Bank (SNB) had announced 
on September 15 that they would reintroduce 84-day U.S. dollar auctions.
3  The first of 
these auctions was held in early October but saw only limited demand at the ECB and no 
demand at the BOE and the SNB.  The weak demand may have reflec ted potential stigma  
associated with the auctions or a desire by some banks to wait until the November or 
December auction in order to better gauge  their dollar funding needs over year-end.  
Reflecting a deteriorating economic outlook and continued funding pressures, the 
BOE and the ECB announced additional polic y easing.  The BOE announced a larger-
than-expected £75 billion expansion of its a sset purchase program to £275 billion.  U.K. 
gilt yields fell immediately after the announcemen t, but they were little changed, on net, 
3 In coordination, the Bank of Japan announced an 84-day dollar auction covering year-end, which 
was added to its established monthly schedule of 84-day dollar operations.

by the end of the day and rose over the s ubsequent week.  The ECB left its main 
refinancing rate unchanged at its October policy meeting but announced that it would 
conduct two new 12-month refinancing operation s in October and December and that it 
will launch a second covered bond purchase pr ogram with an intended amount of 
purchases of €40 billion.4  To contain pressures on the funding costs of vulnerable 
European governments, the ECB maintained  its purchases of s overeign debt, although 
these purchases slowed considerably from the pace seen in August.   
Emerging market stock prices fell sh arply in September and rebounded over 
October, leaving them little changed, on ne t, over the intermeeting period.  Emerging 
market equity and bond funds experienced large outflows in September, but these 
outflows slowed considerably in subsequent  weeks.  The central banks of Brazil, 
Indonesia, and Israel lowered their policy rates, citing a potential slowdown in global 
growth.  Amid heightened concerns about potential funding pressures, Korea and Japan 
announced that they would increase the size a nd scope of their bilateral currency swap 
arrangements, expanding the size of their existing yen–won swap facilities and 
establishing a new $30 billion yen–dollar swap  facility.  
In a reversal of the trend seen over the year through Ju ly, private foreign investors 
showed a revived appetite for U.S. Treasur y securities in Augus t, increasing their 
holdings substantially.  Official  holdings of U.S. Treasury securities rose only modestly, 
on net, but these movements masked large a nd offsetting flows.  Total Chinese holdings 
of U.S. Treasury securities dropped substantia lly in August.  In contrast, Japanese and 
Swiss holdings rose in line w ith currency interventions by au thorities in these countries.  
With the pace of intervention slowing, more recent data on custody holdings at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed some  decline.  In addition, some countries in 
emerging Asia apparently sold U.S. Treasur y securities in September as part of 
intervention efforts to support their currencies.  Cross-bo rder banking flows in August 
were modest, on net, the result of substantia l inflows from European entities, which built 
up their cash holdings at the Federal Reserv e, and outflows from U.S. entities, which 
shifted funds overseas. 
4 The first 12-month operation was held on October 26 and saw demand of €57 billion, which was 
in line with market expectations.

DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad price indexes for U.S. equities incr eased about 2¼  percent, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, as declines early in the period were more than retraced over the past 
few weeks.  Movements in share prices im portantly reflected changes in investor 
confidence about efforts to contain the Europ ean crisis.  Indeed, equity prices have 
remained unusually volatile, and option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index 
fluctuated in a high range.  Meanwhile, th e spread between the 12-month forward trend 
earnings–price ratio for S&P 500 firms and an  estimate of the real long-run Treasury 
yield—a rough measure of the equity premium in U.S. equ ity prices—was little changed, 
on net, and remained at an extraordinarily high level. 
Corporate yields for BBB-rated issuers rose about in line with those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities over the period.  In contra st, speculative-grade 
corporate yields were down a bit, on net, leav ing their spreads notably lower.  The levels 
of corporate bond spreads, however, remain  near the upper ends  of their ranges 
experienced since mid-2009.  Moreover, measures  of liquidity in the secondary market 
for speculative-grade corporate bonds worsened  noticeably at times but changed little, on 
net, over the intermeeting period as a whole.   In the secondary market for syndicated 
leveraged loans, average bid prices and bid-asked spreads were also little changed.  The 
spread of yields on A2/P2-rated unsecure d commercial paper issued by nonfinancial 
firms over yields on A1/P1-rated issues edged up, on net, but remained below its long-run 
average.  
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Credit flows for nonfinancial firms were mixed in September and October, with 
evidence of continued strains in some mark ets, particularly for credit to lower-rated 
firms.  The pace of bond financing by investme nt-grade nonfinancial corporations slowed 
some in October from its robust September pace, while bond issuance by speculative-grade firms returned to a near-zero pace in October.  Nonfinancial commercial paper 
outstanding posted solid growth in October, and C&I loans expanded briskly through the 
first part of the month.  In the leveraged loan  market, issuance financed by institutional 
investors slowed significantly in the third quarter, consistent with the broad reduction in 
risk appetite in late Augus t and September.  However, a few deals that had been 
underwritten earlier in the year , when conditions were more favorable, were successfully 
syndicated in early October.

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms continued to be very weak in 
September and October, with a large number of firms shelving planned IPOs amid 
substantial equity market volat ility.  Net equity issuance re mained negative in the second 
quarter, reflecting the continued strength of cash-financed mergers and share repurchases 
by nonfinancial firms that are, on average, flush with cash and generating substantial 
profits.  Preliminary data on merger activity and announcements of new share repurchase programs suggest that net equity issuance will remain deeply negative in the third quarter. 
About 200 firms in the S&P 500 index have reported operating earnings for the 
third quarter.  Based on those reports and W 
all Street analysts’ estimates for firms that 
have not yet reported, it app ears that earnings per share fo r S&P 500 firms in the third 
quarter grew a solid 7 percent relative to th e second quarter.  However, the majority of 
that gain reflects the fact th at the second quarter reading wa s depressed by a large loss at 
one financial institution.  In a ddition, an index of revisions to  analysts’ forecasts of year-
ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms fell deeper into negative territory  over the four weeks 
ending in mid-October, a decline due in large pa rt to substantial nega tive revisions for the 
financial and energy sectors. 
Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinan cial corporations have continued to be 
solid.  The aggregate ratio of debt to assets stayed low in the second quarter, and the 
liquid asset ratio remained near its highest le vel in more than 20 years.  The volume of 
corporate bonds of nonfinancial companies th at Moody’s upgraded in the third quarter 
substantially outpaced the volume that it downgraded.  Although the six-month trailing 
bond default rate for nonfinancial firms rose s lightly in September, it remained close to 
zero.  The expected year-ahead default rate  for such firms from the Moody’s KMV model 
inched up further, reflecting higher stock price volatility. 
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) markets appeared to have 
deteriorated in some respects over the in termeeting period.  Issuance of commercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) slowed further in the third quarter amid widening CMBS spreads, and only a small number of deal s are in the CMBS pipeline for the rest of 
the year.  In contrast to th is overall trend, life insurance co mpanies have increased their 
holdings of CRE loans by targeting higher-quality borrowers.  Prices of most types of commercial properties remained depressed, a nd aggregate vacancy and delinquency rates 
for commercial properties were close to their recent highs.

HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Interest rates on residential mortgages have moved up slightly, on net, over the 
intermeeting period but remain at historica lly low levels.  The low rates have had a 
relatively modest effect on mort gage refinancing, as tight underwriting standards and low 
home equity continue to limit the access of many households to the mortgage market (see 
the box “Why Haven’t More Borrowers Refi nanced?”).  On October 24, the Federal 
Housing Finance Agency announced change s to the Home Affordable Refinance 
Program, or HARP, to expand eligibility a nd take-up among borrowers with mortgages 
backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  High-coupon MBS underperformed on the day 
of the announcement, suggesting that market pa rticipants may be e xpecting increases in 
refinancing activity in that segment. 
Indicators of home prices and mortgage credit quality remained weak, as a large 
inventory of unsold properti es and tepid demand for home s continued to put downward 
pressure on house prices.  The seasonally ad justed repeat-sales house price index from 
CoreLogic inched down in August, leaving home prices about 4½ percent lower than a 
year earlier.  The rate of newly delinquent prime mortgages—the pace at which 
mortgages transition from “current” to deli nquent—rose over the summer but remained 
below last year’s levels.   
Consumer credit decreased at an annual rate of about 5 percent in August, with 
declines in both revolving and nonrevolving credit.  However, nonrevolving credit had 
grown briskly in July, with a shift in the tim ing of student loan or iginations from August 
into July apparently explaining much of  the recent swing.  Smoothing through this 
volatility, growth in nonrevolving credit has stepped down from earlier in the year but 
remained solid in recent months.  Issuan ce of consumer credit ABS continued apace 
through mid-October.  Delinquency rates for several categories of consumer loans 
remained low, with the delinquency rate on cred it cards in securitized pools at a historical 
low.  However, the decline in delinquency rates partly reflects  tighter underwriting 
standards, which have shifte d the composition of borrowers toward those with stronger 
credit histories.

Why  Haven’t   More  Borrowers   Refinanced?  
In  recent  months,  residential   mortgage  interest  rates  have  fallen  to  historically   low  levels.   
As  a  result,  mortgage  refinancing   has  risen,  but  not  as  much   as  would  have  been   
expected   based  on  historical   relationships.    Indeed,  more  borrowers   refinanced   in  2009  
and  2010  than  in  recent  months,  even  though  mortgage  rates  have  been  20  to  90  basis  
points  lower  this  summer  and  fall.   Here  we  examine   the  latest   available   data  on  the  
extent   to  which  negative  equity,  impaired   credit,  and  limited  credit  availability   are  
obstacles   to  refinancing.   
One  way  to  measure  the  strength  of  the  incentive   to  refinance  is  the  difference  between   
existing  interest  rates  on  outstanding   mortgages   and  the  current  offer  rate.   When  this  
difference  is  large—say,    75  basis  points  or  more—existing   mortgages   are  said  to  be  “in  
the  money”  for  a  refinance.   We  compare  the  interest  rate  on  prime  first  lien,  fixed‐ rate  
mortgages   outstanding   to  the  offer  rate  as  of  the  third  week  of  October   for  new  
originations,   taking  account  of  the  GSEs’  loan‐ level  pricing  adjustments.   As  shown  by  the  
height  of  the  blue  line  at  the  left  edge  of  the  shaded  “in  the  money”  region  in  the  figure  
below,  about  26  million  prime  fixed‐rate  mortgages   are  currently  in  the  money  to  
refinance.    Of  those  mortgages,  22  million   have  positive  equity  (the  red  line),   and  
17  million  have  estimated   current  loan‐ to‐value  (LTV)  ratios  of  80  percent  or  less  (the  
green  line).    Of  these,  14  million   borrowers  are  current  on  their  mortgage  payments   and  
likely  have  fairly  good  credit  (the  black  line).    Thus,  all  told,  just  over  half  of  the  in‐the‐
money  mortgages   are  likely  eligible  to  be  refinanced   but  could  face  additional   difficulties   
in  refinancing.  
Other  data  sources   on  refinancing   confirm  that  impaired  credit  and  negative  equity  have  
hampered   refinancing.   First,  estimates   from  the  Feder al  Reserve  Bank  of  New  York  
Consumer   Credit  Panel/Equifax   suggest  that  mortgage  refinancing   in  2010  was  highest  
among  consumers   with  pristine  credit  scores  and  was  lower  for  those  in  the  five  states  
that  experienced   the  sharpest  house  price  declines.   Second,   performance  data  on  GSE

mortgage  pools  suggest  that  borrowers   who  took  out  mortgages   in  2006  0r  2007  made  
up  only  a  small   share  of  total  refinancing   in  the  third  quarter  of  2011,   despite  facing  
average  interest   rates  of  over  6  percent.   Borrowers  who  obtained   mortgages   during  
these  years  experienced   the  largest  cumulative  house  price  declines  and  are  thus  more  
likely  to  have  negative  equity.  
One   final  piece  of  evidence  is  that  many  lenders  appear  not  to  be  offering  mortgages   to  
borrowers   with   lower  credit  quality.   The  figure   below  reports  the  percent  of  lenders  
posting  offer   rates  on  mortgages   eligible  for  GSE  purchase,   albeit  with   different  loan  
quality,  ranging  from  the  lowest  quality  in  the  left‐most  bars  to  the  highest  quality  in  the  
right‐ most  bars.1   Even  though  all  of  these  loans  have  remained  eligible   for  sale  to  the  
GSEs,  many  mortgage  lenders  have  seemingly   not  been  offering  them,  possibly  because  
of  the  “putback”   or  litigation  risks  that  might  still  be  associated   with  new  loans  to  
borrowers   with  less‐than ‐pristine  credit  histories.   That  said,  lenders   appear  to  have   
become  more  willing  to  extend  credit  to  borrowers   with  medium  credit  quality  compared   
with  a  year  ago.  
On  October  24,  the  Federal  Housing  Finance   Agency  (FHFA)  announced   changes  to  the  
Home  Affordable  Refinance  Program  (HARP)  to  expand  eligibility   and  take‐up  among  
borrowers  with  mortgages   backed  by  Fannie  Mae  and  Freddie  Mac.   Specifically,  the  
changes  remove  the  maximum  LTV  ceiling;  reduce  risk‐based  fees,  particularly   for  
borrowers  refinancing   into  shorter‐term  mortgages;  perm it  the  use  of  automated   
valuation  models  instead  of  new  property  appraisals;  and  extend  the  duration  of  HARP  to  
December   31,  2013.   Also,  the  announcement   suggested   that  the  FHFA  may  waive  many  
representations   and  warranties   for  lenders,  which  has  the  potential   to  significantly   
reduce  the  risks  lenders   assume  when  refinancing   loans  under  HARP  and  may  further  
encourage  lenders  to  offer  more  medium‐ and  low‐quality  mortgages.   The  FHFA  
estimates   that  an  additional  1  million   mortgages   will  be  refinanced   and  stated  that  
additional   details  about  the  HARP  expansion  would  be  released   in  mid‐November.

demand at the auctions remained strong, and bid-to-cover ratios were near or above 
recent averages.  Foreign participation was robust early in the period, although indirect 
bidding was a little below recent averages at the 10- and 30-year reopenings in mid-
October. 
For state and local governments, financi ng conditions were m ixed.  While gross 
long-term issuance of municipal bonds rema ined robust in September and October on 
strong refunding activity, the pace of new capital issuance continued to lag behind.  
Moody’s ratings downgrades of  municipal bonds again subs tantially outpaced upgrades 
in the second quarter, and higher-frequency da ta on ratings changes suggest that this 
trend is likely to persist in the third quarter.   CDS spreads for states increased further over 
the intermeeting period.  Yields on long-term  general obligation (GO) municipal bonds 
were about flat, on net, and the ratio of GO bond yields to yields on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities—a gauge of the relative  risk of municipal bonds—fluctuated around 
levels that are comparable to  those seen in early 2009.   
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND  MONEY  
Bank credit expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in  the third quarter, supported 
by the first quarterly expansion in loans sin ce the fourth quarter of  2008.  However, much 
of the increase was attributable to a surge in  noncore loans, which are volatile and tend to 
increase during periods of financ ial distress.  That growth wa s concentrated at a few large 
institutions and reflected pa rticularly rapid expansion in reverse repos with nonbank 
financial firms.  Banks’ securities holdings  edged down during the third quarter, as a 
steep decline in Treasury and agency debt securities was mostly offset by increases in 
agency MBS and other securities.  
Core loans expanded slightly, t hough with uneven movement across 
subcategories.  C&I loans acce lerated in the third quarter following the already strong 
increases seen over the first half of the year.  That growth has been fairly concentrated 
among large domestic banks and branches and agencies of non-European foreign banks.  
Consumer loans, which include credit card loans and other consumer loans, advanced 
modestly in the third quarter, ending a two-year string of quarterly declines.  Closed-end 
residential mortgage loans held on banks’ book s increased amid the moderate pickup in 
refinancing activity, but home e quity loans declined further.   CRE loans contracted for 
the 11th consecutive quarter.

The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surv ey on Bank Lending Practices conducted in 
October showed noticeably less net easing of  lending standards by domestic banks than 
in the previous surveys.  In particular, fe wer domestic banks eased standards and terms 
on C&I loans over the third quarter compared  with the previous several quarters, 
particularly for loans to large and middle-ma rket firms.  Moreover,  about one-third, on 
net, of the branches and agencies of European banks that participated in the survey 
reported having tightened lending standards on C& I loans, with most of those institutions 
attributing the change at least partly to c oncerns about their liqui dity positions.  In 
response to a special question, a large number of both domes tic and foreign respondents 
indicated considerable  tightening of standa rds on loans to European banks and their 
affiliates or subsidiaries.  Standards for commercial and residential real estate loans 
changed little over the past three months, wh ile a  modest net fracti on of banks indicated 
that they had eased standards on consumer loans. 
Demand for loans was little changed over the third quarter on balance.  Although 
a m
oderate net fraction of all SLOOS res pondents reported that demand for C&I loans 
had weakened, some large banks reported str onger demand for such lo ans.  Several large 
banks also reported increased demand for CRE loans.  On the household side, demand for 
loans to purchase homes reportedly imp roved, but we suspect respondents do not 
distinguish between purchase lo ans and refinancings, and th e gain likely reflects the 
moderate increase in refinancing activity in  recent months.  Demand for home equity 
loans decreased, and that for consumer loan s reportedly was little changed.  (See the 
appendix on the survey at the end of this section.) 
Third-quarter earnings reports of large banking institutions were mixed.  
Revenues from investment banking activities declined, as debt and equity underwriting 
fees fell substantially.  Lower net interest  margins also continued to put downward 
pressure on earnings.  These effects, however, were offset by unusually large gains from 
downward adjustments to the fair values of cer tain liabilities at a few institutions on the 
basis of the significant net increase in banks’ own credit spreads at the end of the third 
quarter.  Finally, banks continued to run off their loan loss reserves amid ongoing 
improvements in the performance of their outstanding loans and leases.  
M2 grew at an average a nnual rate of 5 percent in September and October, well 
below the rapid pace seen in July and August.   Some of the factors contributing to M2 
growth over the summer, such as concerns about European financ ial developments and

equity market volatility, persisted, supporting elevated levels of M2 deposits but not 
triggering additional sizable inflows.  Liquid deposit growth averaged a solid 8 percent at 
an annual rate in September and October, and retail money market mutual funds also 
expanded over the past two months on balance.   Small time deposits continued to run off 
amid extremely low yields that offered littl e benefit to investors over keeping funds in 
more-liquid savings deposits.  In September and October, on average, currency growth 
was somewhat below its historical rate.  Th e monetary base grew at an average annual 
rate of 2¾ percent as its major components— reserve balances and currency—increased 
over the period.  (See the box “Balance Sheet  Developments over the Intermeeting

Balance  Sheet  Developments   over  the  Intermeeting  Period  
Over  the  intermeeting   period,   total  assets  of  the  Federal  Reserve  were  little  
changed  at  $2,858  billion  (see  table   on  facing  page),  but  the  Federal  Reserve  
began  to  take  steps  to  extend  the  average  maturity   of  its  securities   holdings.     
Consistent   with  the  September  21,  2011,  FOMC  decision,   the  Open  Market  Desk  at  
the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  New  York  (FRBNY)  conducted   16  permanent  
operations   over  the  period,  purchasing   $41  billion  in  Treasury   securities   with  
remaining   maturities   of  6  to  30  years  and  selling  $28  billion  in  Treasury   securities   
with   maturities   of  3  years  or  less.1   Notably,   sale  operations   thus  far  have  resulted  
in  large  bid‐to‐cover  ratios,  and  the  awards  have  been  somewhat   concentrated   
among  dealers.   On  October  3,  the  Desk  began  reinvesting   principal  payments   
from  its  agency  debt  securities   and  agency  MBS  securities   into  agency  MBS  and,  
to  date,  has  reinvested   $19  billion.   Due  to  agency  MBS  market   conventions,   
settlements   of  these  transa ctions  can  occur  well  after  trade  execution;   most  
October  MBS  purchases   will  settle  in  December   and  do  not  yet  appear  on  the  
balance  sheet.  
The  net  portfolio  holdings  of  Maiden  Lane  LLC  declined  $2  billion,  while  holdings  
of  the  Maiden  Lane  II  and  Maiden  Lane  III  LLCs  were  nearly  uncha nged.   Loans  
outstanding   under  the  Term  Asset‐Backed  Securities   Loan  Facility  remained  
around  $11  billion.   Foreign  central  bank  liquidity  swaps  increased   about  $1  billion,  
reflecting   an  84‐day  draw  by  the  European   Central  Bank,  but  remained   very  low.  
On  the  liability  side  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s   balance  sheet,  the  other  deposits  
category  increased   $43  billion  over  the  period,  reflecting   relatively   high  GSE  
balances  at  the  end  of  the  intermeeting   period,  consistent   with  a  buildup  of  
funds  in  this  account  prior  to  payment  of  principal  and  interest  (P&I)  on  MBS.   
These  funds  tend  to  reverse  the  day  of  the  P&I  payment  date.   Federal  Reserve  
notes  in  circulation   increased   $5  billion  over   the  period.   The  Treasury’s   General  
Account  decreased   $12  billion.   Reserve  balances  of  depository   institutions   
decreased   $20  billion  over  the  period.   Reverse  repurchase   transactions   with  
foreign  official  and  international   accounts   decreased   $16  billion,  reflecting   an  
unwind  of  central  bank  intervention ‐related  flows.   The  $5  billion  Term  Deposit  
Facility  auction  conducted   on  September   19,  2011,  matured  on  October  20  and  so  
had  no  net  effect  over  the  period.    
On  October  4,  2011,  the  FRBNY  added  BMO  Capital  Markets  Corporation   and  
Bank  of  Nova  Scotia,  New  York  Agency,  to  its  list  of  primary  dealers,  bringing  the  
current  number  of  primary  dealers  to  22.  
1 Purchases of $7 billion conducted on October 24, 2011, and October 25, 2011, are not 
reflected in the table, as settlement occurred after October 24, 2011. The Desk also conducted

Appendix  
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey  on Bank Lending Practices  
In the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices , domestic 
banks, on balance, reported  little net change in lending standards or demand over the past   
three months.1  Foreign respondents, which  mainly lend to businesses, reported a noticeable net  
tightening of their lending standards.2   In response to  a special question, a large numb er of both  
domestic and foreign respondents indicated considerable tightening of standards on loans to  
European banks and their affiliates or subsidiaries.  
Regarding lending standards, f ewer domestic banks eased standards and  terms on  C&I  
loans over the third quarter compared with  recent quarters, particular ly on loans to large and 
middle- market firms. 3   Moreover, about one- third  of the  15 branches and agencies of European  
banks that participated in the survey reported that  they  had tightened lending standa rds on C&I  
loans, with most of  those institutions attributing the change at least partly to concerns about  their  
liquidity positions.   Standards for commercial and residential  real estate loans changed little over  
the past  three months, but a  small  net fra ction of  banks  indicated that they had eased standards on 
several types of consumer loans.  
According to the survey, demand for loans  was  roughly unchanged on balance.  Although 
a moderate net fraction of banks report ed  weaker demand for C&I loans—in  contrast to the  
increased d emand reported  in the previous  three  surveys—some  of the  large st  banks reported 
stronger demand.4   Several large banks also reported increased demand for  commercial  real estate 
loans.  On the household side, demand for loans  to purchase homes reportedly improved, though 
those reports  likely reflect ed  the moderate increase in refinancing activity .5   Demand for home  
equity loans decreased  and demand for consumer loans reportedly was little changed.    
1 The October 2011 survey addressed changes in the supply of and demand for loans to businesses 
and households over the past three months.  This appendix is based on responses from 51 domestic banks 
and 22 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Respondent banks received the survey on or after 
October 4, 2011, and responses were due by October 18, 2011.
2 For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction 
of banks that reported having tightened standards minus the fraction of banks tha t reported having eased 
standards.  For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fraction of banks that 
reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand. 
3 Large and middle -market firms are generally defined as firms with annual sales of $50 million or 
more and small firms as those with annual sales of less than $50 million. 
4 Large banks are defined as banks with assets greater than or equal to $20 billion as of 
March 31, 2011, and othe r banks as those with assets of less than $20 billion. 
5 Survey respondents are instructed to consider only demand for new originations as opposed to 
the refinancing of existing mortgages.  However, the responses to this question are highly correlated with measures of refinancing activity.

LENDING TO BUSINESS  
Questions on  Commercial and Industrial  Lending  
Only a small net fraction of  domestic banks reported having eased standards on C&I  
loans during the  third quarter, in contrast to more widespread reports  in previous  quarters.  This  
moderate net reduction in easing was co ncentrated in loans  to large and middle- market firms 
rather  than in  loans to smaller firms.  Moreover, branches and  agencies of foreign banks, which 
generally only lend to larger firms, reported a  tightening of standards  on C&I loans  for the first  
time in  several quarters.   Foreign survey respondents included subsidiaries of both European and  
non-European banks, but  this tightening was limited  to  subsidiaries of European banks, especially  
French  banks, and partly reflected  funding pressures at those banks.  Domestic banks continued to  
ease some terms on C&I loans to both large and small  firms, including  by cutti ng loan rate  
spreads over  banks’ costs of funds and  by reducing the  use of interest rate floors.  However, the  
fraction of banks  reporting such  easing  of terms on loans to  larger firms  declined  somewhat, and 
premiums on riskier loans reportedly increased on net .  Foreign banks tightened all terms on C&I  
loans on net.  Taken together, t hese developments are roughly consistent with  reports elsewhere 
of a  tightening of  terms in the syndicated loan market over the  third quarter.  
Banks that reported having eased  standards  or  terms on C&I loans continued to widely  
cite more -aggressive  competition  from other banks or nonbank  lenders.  F ewer banks cited a 
more favorable or  less uncertain economic outlook as a reason for easing compared with  the  
previous  survey.  In contrast, banks that reported having tightened standards unanimously cited a  
less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook.  These banks also noted  reduced tolerances 
for  risk, decreased liquidity in the secondary market, and increased concerns about government  
polic ies (legislative, supervisory, or accounting).  There is some evidence that dollar funding  
pressure s contributed to  the tightening at  subsidiaries of European banks ; most  respondents  cited  
a deterioration in their  liquidity positions  as a reason for tightening loan standards.  
Reports of weaker  demand for  C&I loans outnumbered reports of  stronger demand in a  
noticeable  reversal from  recent quarters,  particularly  with respect  to demand from large and 
middle- market firms.   However, a couple of  the  large st banks reported that demand had increased 
somewhat , and demand actually rose a bit  on a weighted basis.6   Reports of  increased  inquiries  
from potential business borrowers  for new credit lines also  decreased significantly  and, for the  
first time in several  quarters,  were  outnumbered by reports of decreased inquiries;  this strong  net  
shift  was also apparent on  a weighted basis.   Banks that saw stronger demand for C&I loans  cited  
many of the same determinants of demand as b  anks that saw weaker demand, perhaps reflecting  
the particular and varying needs of their customers.   These factors  included  the need to fina nce 
inventories, accounts  receivable, investments  in plants  and equipment, and merger and acquisition  
activities.   Banks that saw  weaker demand  for C&I loans  were much more likely to cite an

increase in customers’  internally generated funds, and banks that  saw stronger demand were more 
likely to cite  a  shift  in borrowing from other bank or nonbank sources.   
Special Questions on Lending to Firms with European Exposures  
A set of special  questions  in the October survey asked respondents about lending to banks  
headquartered in Europe and their  affiliates and subsidiaries (regardless of  the location of the 
affiliates and subsidiaries) and to nonfinancial firms  that have operations in the United States  and  
significant exposures to European economies  (regardless o f  whether the firms are domestic or  
foreign).   
About  one-half of  the  domestic bank respondents, mostly large banks, indicated that they 
make loans or extend credit lines to European banks or  their affiliates  or  subsidiaries, and about  
two-thirds of the foreign responden ts indicated the sa  me.  Among those domestic and  foreign  
respondents, a large amount—about  two-thirds—reported  having tightened standards on loans  to 
European banks over  the  third  quarter.  Many indicated that the tightening was considerable.   
About three- fifths of  the domestic  respondents, mostly l arge banks, and all foreign 
respondents  indicated  that they  make loans or extend  credit  lines to nonfinancial firms that have 
operations in the United States and significant exposures to European economies.  Among these  
domestic and foreign respondents, a moderate  fraction indicated that they had tightened standards 
on C&I loans  to such firms.  These loans reportedly constituted  a small  portion—less than   
5 percent —of outstanding C&I loans at a majority  of dome stic respondents, although the largest  
regional and national banks reported greater  exposures .  Such loans typically accounted  for larger  
portions of the foreign respondents’ lending .   
Small net  fractions of domestic respondents indicated  weaker demand for credit from  
European banks  (and their  affiliates  or subsidiaries) and from nonfinancial firms  with significant  
exposures to European economies.    
Questions on Commercial Real Estat e Lending  
Domestic b anks continued to report  little  change  in their standards  on CRE loans, which  
were widely described  in t he previous survey  as being at or near their tightest levels since 2005.  
In contrast, a  large fraction of foreign respondents  reported having tightened standards  on CRE  
loans, in a  substantial  shift from  the  net easing  reported by  those institutions  in  the  prior  two  
surveys.   Modest fractions of d omestic b anks continued to report  strengthening of demand for  
CRE loans, on net, although these reports were  a bit less widespread than in the two previous  
surveys .  Also, fewer  foreign respondents  reported that  CRE demand had strengthened than in the  
previous surv ey.

LENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS  
Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending  
Reports of strengthened demand for  mortgage loans to  purchase homes outnumbered 
reports of weaker demand for the first  time since early 2010 .  However , this series tends to  
respond to increased refinancing activity , as occurred  in the  third quarter, suggesting that  loan 
officers may have difficulty distinguishing  demand for  refinancing from demand for mortgages to 
purchase homes.  O n a weighted basis,  the net  change in demand was sligh tly negative,  although 
noticeably less negative than in recent  surveys .  The number of banks reporting weaker demand 
for home equity lines  of  credit  increased  notably in the third quarter,  particularly  among  smaller  
banks.   
Few banks reported changes in  standards on prime or nontraditional closed-end 
residential real estate  loans, in line with the past several surveys .  Therefore, standards  likely  
remain tighter  than the ir  average level since 2005  (as reported  in the July  survey).   Similarly,  very 
few banks  reported  any change in standards  for home equity lines of  credit, also  in line with  
recent  surveys .   
Questions on Consumer Lending  
Modest  fractions of banks reported having eased  standards on consumer credit card loans 
and on other non-auto loans.  As i n  the previous survey, somewhat larger fractions of banks 
reported having eased standards  on auto loans.  These reports  suggest  a continued modest  
unwinding of banks’ lending standards for these loans, as the July survey had indicated that  
standards on con sumer loans were generally the same as  or tight er  than the middle  of the  range of  
such standards since 2005.  
Banks, on net, continued to report having narrowed the spreads of i nterest rate s  on auto 
loans and other non- credit card loans over  their cost  of funds, though these reports have been 
volatile over  the past few quarters.   A modest net  fraction of banks also reported lengthening  
maximum maturities and lowering minimum  required credit scores on  auto loans.   Small numbers  
of banks reported having ea sed some terms on credit card loans  and other non-auto loans.  
A small number  of banks , on net, reported a strengthening of demand for consumer credit  
card and auto loans, in  line with  the past few quarters.   Few banks reported  any change in demand 
for oth er consumer loans.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF  FORECAST  UNCERTAINTY  
We continue to see the risks around our projection for  real  economic activity as  
skewed to the downside  and as elevated relative to the average experience of the past   
20 years  (the  benchmark used by the  FOMC  Committee).   The financial crisis and the 
subsequent recession were both large and historically unusual, making it difficult to judge  
the relative influences  of  supply and demand in generating the contraction as well as the  
likely pace of the  recovery  going forward.  In addition, uncertainty  about the ability of  
domestic monetary and fiscal policy to address near-term economic weakness is high and 
magnified , in  the case of  fiscal policy , by the fact that current policies are not sustainable  
over the longer  run.  In fact, r elative to the June Tealbook, when we last reported our  
views on this issue, our  uncertainty  about the outlook for real activity  has  increased  
somewhat.  Some of this  heightened  uncertainty  reflect s the  increased strains in European 
financial markets and the attendant question of whether  policymakers  there will 
successfully resolve the situation .  In addition, the  domestic financial system  appears  
more vulnerable to adverse developments now than it did in June.   
We continue to see the risks around our  baseline projection  for inflation as  
somewhat elevated  relative to the experience of the past 20  years , but—unlike the case 
with real activit y—we view them as roughly balanced .  With regard to balance, very  low 
levels of resource utilization,  small increases  in labor costs, the  federal  funds rate having  
reached its effective lower bound,  and more-pessimistic views on the economic outlook 
could, on the one hand, cause inflation  to drift down over time.  On the other hand, 
concerns  related to the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  and the  viability of  
executing a timely exit from the current stance of  policy  could cause inflation to move  
up, as might renewed increases in commodity prices, a more-pronounced weakening in the exchange value of the dollar, and concerns about undisciplined fiscal policy.  With  
regard  to the overall degree of uncertainty, difficulties associated with  gauging eco nomic  
slack in the wake of an unusually deep recession imply risks—in both directions—to our  
assessment of the role that slack will play in influencing inflation going  forward .  
Nevertheless, we see the relative stability of inflation expectations  over the  past   
four years (and  before)  as limiting the risk s  in this  area.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS   
To illustrate some of the  risks to the outlook, we construct  several alternatives to  
the baseline projection using simulations of staff  models.  In the  first scenar io, we assume 
that the economy is slipping into recession and that the fragile condition of  many  
households and some financial institutions, in conjunction with the limited capacity of  
policymakers to buffer the downturn, cause what  would otherwise be  a modest recession  
to escalate into a sizable retrenchment in economic activity.   In the second  simulation , we 
assume that several  factors , such as  the capacity of the financial system to support the  
expansion, are  more restrict ive than in the baseline and will m arkedly restrain the pace of  
economic recovery  for many  years , resulting in  a “lost decade”  reminiscent of the  
Japanese experience.  The third  scenario builds on the second  one by  assuming  that  
substantial damage to the supply side of the  economy  has  already been sustained,  
implying that the margin  of slack is narrower  than  assumed in  the  baseline, and  that 
gradual recognition of these less favorable supply-side conditions by policymakers cause  
long- run inflation expectations to increase appreciably .  The next two scenario s consider  
upside risks to real activity, with the first featuring a vigorous snapback in domestic  
demand , and the second centering on faster  foreign  economic  growth that sets off  a 
virtuous cycle  domestically  and abroad.  The final  scenario  considers the risk of a severe 
financial crisis in Europe, w ith significant spillover s  to the United States and the rest of  
the world.  
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and an estimated  
policy rule that responds  to core PC E inflation and the staff concept of  economic slack .  
The last  two  scenarios are generated using the multicountry SIGMA model, which uses a  
different policy  rule for the federal funds rate that  employs an alternative  concept of  
resource utilization.1  
Recession  
While the  recent  spending  data have had a somewhat firmer tone, the economic 
recovery has nonetheless been disappointingly slow and remains  precarious .  In  
particular, a moribund housing sector, restrict ed access to credit , and  ongoing balance 
1 In the simulations using the FRB/US model, the federal funds rate follows the outcome -based 
rule described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.  In the simulations using SIGMA, the policy rule 
is broadly similar, but uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the 
model ’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of a slow adjustment in wages and 
prices.

sheet repair  continue to weigh heavily on the spending decisions of households and firms. 
We assume in this scenario that , going forward, these factors contribute to an unusually  
high degree of pessimism and place  further strains on financial institutions , thereby  
tipping the economy into recession.  Moreover, the downturn is  markedly exacerbated by  
the limited ability of monetary and fiscal policy to counteract the weakness.  Real GDP  
contracts  2 percent  in 2012, causing the unemployment rate to rise to 11½  percent .  
Thereafter,  the economy  gradually recovers but the unemployment  rate  falls only to   
7¼ percent in late 2016.  Such a persistent and elevated degree of  economic slack  puts  
substantial downward pressure on inflation, and consumer prices  decline modestly  from  
2014 to 2016.  Under these conditions, the federal funds rate rem ains near  zero  until late  
2016. 
Lost Decade  
Our baseline forecast depends importantly on steady improvements in the balance 
sheet positions of households and financial institutions, credit availability, consumer and 
business confidence, and the willingness of firms to hire.  In this scenario, these  
improvements  are much  slower to  materialize  than in the baseline  and cause the pace of  
recovery to remain exceedingly slow, r esulting in a  “lost decade.”  Moreover, t he 
persistently sluggish growth in spending and output  has  a corrosive effect  on the supply  
side of the economy  because, with  unemployment remaining very high for  many  years,  
the skills and labor force  attachment of unemployed workers  erode more than in the 
baseline.   As a result , the downward trend in labor force  participation  steepen s  relative to  
the baseline and the NAIRU  edges up to 6¼ percent by 2014 (½ percentage point above  
baseline)  and  thereafter  falls at a slower pace.  In all, potential GDP expands about   
½ percentage point more  slowly per  year through 2016.  Under these  conditions, real  
GDP expands at only a 2¼ percent  annual rate on  average through the middle of the  
decade.  Because the expans ion in aggregate demand barely outpaces the growth of  
potential output on average, the unemployment rate remains close to 9 percent through 2016 and inflation  eventually  falls  below 1 percent .  With real activity so weak and  
inflation  so low, the federal funds rate remains  at its effective lower bound beyond 2016.  
Greater  Supply -Side Damage  
Although the previous scenario incorporated weaker  growth in potential output  
over the projection period, it assumed that the staff’s estimate of the  current level of  
economic slack is correct.   However, we may have  underestimated how much damage

has already occurred to the economy’s productive potential, and this scenario builds on 
the previous  one by further assum ing that the cur rent output gap is half  as  wide  as in the 
baseline, reflecting  both lower potential labor input  and smaller  multifactor productivity  
gains over the past few  years.  Accordingly, real  GDP rises at an annual rate of about   
1¾ percent for  the next three  years and about 2¼ percent thereafter.   Owing to the weaker  
supply conditions in this scenario, the rate of increase in real GDP is sufficient to push  
the unemployment rate  down a bit  next year  and in 2013; thereafter, the weak economy  
causes  the unemployment rate to settle  in  at slightly  below 9  percent.  Because 
policymakers are assumed to recognize only  gradually the less favorable supply- side 
conditions, long- run  inflation  expectations gradually drift up.  Reflecting  the upward 
movement in inflation expectations, as well as  the effects of lower  productivity  and a 
smaller margin of slack , core PCE  inflation  moves above 2½ per cent  in 2013 and stays  
near that level through 2016. 
Faster Snapback  
Recent spending data have been stronger than expected, suggesting some  upside  
risks to the outlook.  In this scenario, the effects of the adverse factors  that have held 
back the recovery to date dissipate more rapidly than in the baseline, leading to a more  
robust expansion.  Real GDP rises at  an annual rate of about 3 percent in the s econd half  
of this  year and 3½ percent  on average in 2012 and 2013, bring ing the unemployment  
rate down to 7¼ percent  by the  end of 2013, about ¾ percentage point below baseline.  
Initially, the stronger pace of recovery has little effect on inflation because  higher  
investment in creases labor productivity (thereby  holding down unit labor  costs) and 
because long -run inflation expectations are well anchored.  In time, however, tighter  
labor and product markets cause inflation to move up more than in the baseline.  Largely  
in response to the stronger pace of real activity, the federal funds rate begins to rise in 
mid-2013. 
Faster Global Recovery 
In this scenario, output  growth across our major trading partners  turns out to be  
modestly stronger  than  we expect, as favorable real -side d evelopments contribute to, and 
are reinforced by , a more rapid return of confidence and improvement in the tone of  
financial markets.  Specifically,  foreign output expands about 1 percentage  point faster  
than in the baseline through the  end of 2013, as  sentiment improves, consumption picks  
up, and corporate risk  spreads fall ; in addition, the broad real dollar depreciates about

5 percent  relative to baseline due to a reversal of safe- haven flows  and faster removal of  
monetary accommodation abroad.  The str onger foreign activity  and the weaker dollar  
cause U.S. real net exports  to rise relative to the baseline.   Moreover, a modest decline in  
U.S. corporate  risk spreads, which are  assumed to fall about 50 basis points relative to  
baseline, also helps to boost domestic spending.  All told, U.S. real  GDP rises  3¼ percent  
in 2012 and 4 percent in 2013, and the unemployment  rate falls to  7½ percent by the  end 
of 2013.  Higher import  prices and stronger activity boost core PCE inflation to  nearly   
2 percent in 2012 and 2013, and induce the federal funds rate to rise in early  2014, about  
two quarters sooner than in the  baseline.  
European Crisis with  Severe Spillovers  
In this scenario, Europe’s financial difficulties intensify markedly, perhaps  due to 
a disorderly sovereign default or the failure of a large financial institution.  Given 
substantial cross-border financial and macroeconomic linkages, Europe’s  financial  
difficulties are  assumed to have large spillovers to the United States and throughout  the 
world.  Specifically, European sovereign and private borrowing c  osts soar, with corporate  
bond spreads rising 400 basis points above baseline.  European real GDP  declines almost  
9 percent  relative to baseline by the second half of 2012, notwithstanding  a 20  percent  
depreciation of the euro.  Financial market spillovers to the United States push U.S. corporate spreads up by  over 300 basis points relative to baseline.  U.S domestic demand 
contracts sharply in response to higher borrowing costs, a weaker stock market, and eroding household and business confidence.  In addition, weaker foreign activity and the  
stronger dollar depress U.S. net exports.  All told, U.S. real GDP contracts  nearly   
4 percent next  year and the unemployment rate rises to nearly 12  percent by  mid-2013.
2   
This greater  resource slack, coupled with lower import prices, pushes core PCE inflation 
below zero in 2012.  Under these  conditions, the federal  funds rate  remains near zero 
until the third quarter of  2015.   
OUTSIDE  FORECASTS  
In  the  October 10 survey, the Blue Chip consensus forecast for the increase  in real  
GDP i n the second half of this  year  was  1.9 percent, somewhat below the current staff  
2 The contraction in U.S. GDP is much larger than in the “Very Severe Financial Stress in 
Europ e” scenario presented in the September Tealbook because this scenario assumes significantly larger 
financial spillovers to the United States and a greater decline in household and business confidence.  (By 
contrast, the shocks to Europe are essentially ide ntical to those included in the September Tealbook 
scenario.)

projection.  The consensus projection show ed real GDP rising 2.3 percent  over the   
four quarters of 2012, just a touch below the staff  projection.  The  Blue Chip forecast for  
the unemployment rate at the end of 2012 was  8.9 percent, which wa s above  the staff  
projection of 8.6 percent.  Regarding inflation, the Blue Chip panelists anticipate d that  
the overall CPI  will increase 3.4 percent over the four quarters of 2011 and 2 percent in 
2012, in line with the staff projection for 2011, but more than ½ percentage  point higher  
in 2012.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
