Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The near-term indicators of real GDP that we have received since the October 
Tealbook have been, on balance, in line with ou r expectations.  Retail sales were stronger 
than expected in October, motor vehicles sold  at a faster pace in November, and reports 
suggest that the holiday shopping season got off to a generally better-th an-expected start.  
In addition, news from the labor market has been a bit better th an anticipated.  In 
contrast, inventory accumulation fell shar ply in the third quart er, federal spending 
appears likely to post a sizable  decline this quarter, and households remain downbeat.  
All told, we project real GDP to increase at  an annual rate of 2½ percent over the second 
half of this year, the same pace as in the October Tealbook.  
Nonetheless, the medium-term projection fo r real GDP growth in this Tealbook is 
weaker than the one we presented in October.   The most important factor is our more 
pessimistic view about the European situati on and its implications for the U.S. economy.  
In our revised baseline projection, foreign demand for our output is diminished because 
of weaker activity abroad and a stronger exch ange value of the dollar.  We also expect 
the turmoil overseas to result in somewhat higher risk premiums, lower equity prices, and lower consumer and business confidence than we previously anticipated, thereby restraining domestic demand.  Separatel y, both real gross domestic income—an 
alternative measure of the same economic c oncept as real GDP—and disposable personal 
income (DPI) have, according to the latest estimates from the BEA, been on markedly 
lower trajectories than the information av ailable in October suggested.  The downward 
revision to real DPI weighs on our projection for the growth  of consumer spending going 
forward.   
Two other adjustments to our assumptions have important implications for the 
contour of economic growth and resource utiliz ation.  First, in light  of the substantial 
decline in the unemployment rate over the past year despite only modest growth of real 
activity, we reduced our assumption for the growth of potential output noticeably in 2011 and to a lesser degree going forward.  Second, we now assume that  the payroll tax cut 
and emergency unemployment benefits will be extended through the end of next year; 
this change adds to GDP growth in 2012.  So me of the fiscal increment to growth is 
unwound in 2013, but some remains to be run off in subsequent years.

Putting all of the pieces together, we now expect real GDP to rise 2¼ percent in 
2012 and 2½ percent in 2013, down ¼ percenta ge point and ¾ percentage point, 
respectively, from the October Tealbook.  B ecause only a small part of this revision 
reflects changes to our supply-side assumptions, we expect less progress will be made in 
lowering the unemployment rate from here forward; the unemployment rate declines  
from 8¾ percent in the current quarter, ¼ pe rcentage point lower than in October, to 
8¼ percent by the end of 2013, a bit higher than in the last proj ection.  More than half of 
the reduction in the unemployment rate reflec ts the expiration of unemployment benefits 
at the end of 2012 rather than a material strengthening of labor market conditions.  
The outlook for inflation is little changed from the Oc tober Tealbook.  The latest 
data appear to support our view that the faster  pace of core inflation evident in the spring 
and summ
er was mainly due to transitory f actors, most notably the pass-through of the 
surge in commodity and import prices during the first half of this year.  In an 
environment in which inflation expectations are anticipated to hol d steady and slack in 
labor and product markets is expected to remain substantial, core infl ation is projected to 
persist at 1½ percent over the ne xt two years.  With energy prices expected to edge down 
over the projection period, headline inflation runs just a bit belo w core in both 2012 and 
2013.  
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
The box on the consequences of the Eur opean crisis discusses the various 
channels through which the developments in  Europe affect our assumptions about 
financial conditions over the projection period.   
Monetary Policy 
With little change in the outlook for slack  in labor and product markets by the end 
of the medium-term projection, and with the inflation forecast essentially unrevised, we 
continue to assume that the FOMC will hold the target federa l funds rate in the current 
range of 0 to ¼ percent well into 2014.  On our revised projection, we now have liftoff 
occurring in the fourth quarter of 2014, one qua rter later than in the October Tealbook.  
We also assume that the Committee will maintain the Federal Reserve’s current portfolio-related policies.

Consequences  of  the  European   Crisis  for  the  U.S.  Outlook  
As  detailed  in  the  International   Developments   section,  European   policymakers   
continue  to  struggle  to  devise  a  credible,   comprehensive   solution  to  the  region’s  
fiscal  crisis,  and  prospects   for  the  region  remain  highly  uncertain.    Amid  
continued   financial  stresses  and  dismal  economic   indicators,   the  staff  now  
anticipates   that  the  euro‐area  economies   will  suffer  a  moderate  recession.    The  
revisions  to  the  projection   for  the  U.S.  economy   since  the  October  Tealbook   
reflect  the  changing   European   situation  in  three   main  ways.   The  first  influence   is  
through  foreign  trade:   In  this  projection,   the  export  forecast  has  been  weakened  
considerably,   reflecting   both  the  weaker  economic   outlook  abroad  (directly  in  
Europe  and  indirectly   in  other  countries   as  well)  and  the  stronger  exchange  value  
of  the  dollar,  reflecting   safe‐haven  demands   for  our  currency  while  the  European  
situation  remains  especially   unsettled.   
Second,  the  European   situation  affects  the  outlook  through  its  effect   on  U.S.  
asset  prices.   Due  in  part  to  strong  safe‐haven  demands,   long‐maturity  U.S.  
Treasury  yield s  have  remained   very  low,  and  private‐sector  bond  spreads  and  
equity  risk  premiums   have  moved  up  noticeably   on  balance.   Correlations   
between   changes  in  the  European  sovereign  bond  spreads  and  movements   in  
U.S.  financial  asset  prices  have  remained   high,  suggesting   that  the  low  levels  of  
long‐term  Treasury  yields  and  the  high  levels  of  the  equity  premium   have  
reflected   continued   concer n  about  the  European  sovereign  debt  crisis.  
Looking  forward,  the  baseline  forecast  assumes  that  the  heightened   uncertainty   
associated   with  the  European   crisis  will  extend  well  into  next  year,  as  European   
policymakers   continue  to  face  difficulties   in  designing  and  implementing   a  set  of  
policies  that  allays  investor  concerns.    As  a  result,  through  the  middle  of  next  
year,  Treasury  yields  are  projected   to  remain  lower  than  they  would  otherwise.    
U.S.  equity  prices  are  forecast  to  stay  roughly  flat,  rather  than  moving  up  steadily  
as  previously   assumed;   similarly,  spreads  on  BBB‐rated  corporate   bonds  and  
conforming   fixed‐ rate  mortgages   are  forecast  to  remain  wide.   Around  the  
middle  of  2012,  however,   we  assume  that  investors,   businesses,   and  households   
will  begin   to  regain   confidence   as  measures   to  address  the  debt  crisis  gain  
traction.   Accordingly,   we  assume   that  Treasury  yields  begin  to  rise  and  risk  
premiums   in  U.S.  financial  markets  start  to  narrow.   Moreover,   the  safe‐haven  
demands   for  dollar‐denominated   assets  begin  to  diminish,   leading  to  some  
unwinding   of  the  recent  dollar  appreciation.     
Finally,  the  heightened   uncertainty   and  pullback  in  risk‐taking  that  is  evident  in  
asset  prices  may  also  make  banks  more   hesitant  to  lend  and  households   and  
businesses   more   hesitant  to  commit  to  major  purchases.    As  with  our  
assumptions   about  asset  prices,  we  assume   that  such  factors  worsen  over  the  
next   several  quarters  but  then  gradually   improve.    As  a  consequence,   consumer

durables  and  investment   spending   have  been   weakened   some  in  2012  but,  
thereafter,   the  drag  from  this  source   eases.    
Despite   gradual  recuperation   beginning   around  the  middle  of  next  year,  our  
revised  thinking  about  the  implications   of  the  European   situation  leaves  a  
persistent  (though  not  permanent)  imprint  on  the  baseline  projection   for  
domestic  real  activity,   reducing  the  level  of  real  GDP  about  ½  percent  by  the  end  
of  2013.    
In  the  event  of  a  more  adverse  outcome  in  Europe,  financial  linkages  between  
Europe  and  the  United  States   could  come  into  play  to  a  greater  degree.   
Although  U.S.  banks  have  significantly   reduced  their  direct  exposures  to  
peripheral  Europe,  they  still  have  large  direct  exposures  to  entities  in  core  
European  countries.   Similarly,  while  U.S.  money  market  funds   (MMFs)  have  cut  
exposures   to  peripheral  Europe,  they  remain  heavily  exposed  to  financial  
institutions   in  core  European  countries.    
It  is  difficult  to  gauge  the  risks  to  the  U.S.  financial  system  should  events  turn  out  
to  be  worse  than  anticipated,  especially   as  some  segments   of  the  financial  
system  are  very  sensitive  even  to  small  losses.   For  example,  losses  in  the  MMF  
sector  could  cause  some  funds  to  “break  the  buck”  and  possibly  induce  a  
catastrophic  run  on  MMFs.   Similarly,  in  repo  markets,  the  recent  U.S.  financial  
crisis  showed  that  doubts  about  the  solvency  of  counterparties  can  trigger  runs.   
The  resulting  inability  to  obtain  short‐ter m  funding  can  lead  to  shortages  of  
liquidity  in  markets  for  longer‐term  assets  as  well  as  fire  sales,  leading  in  turn  to  
declines  in  asset  prices.   Such  an  environment  may  entail  a  more‐general  pullback  
from  risk‐taking,  causing   further  reductions  in  equity  prices,  wider  spreads  on  
risky  securities,  and  a  pullback  in  bank  lending.   Finally,  the  additional  uncertainty   
and  pullback  in  risk‐taking   may  also  make  households  and  businesses  still  more  
reticent  to  increase  their  spending.     
Although  the  staff’s  baseline  forecast  envisions  that  financial  conditions   in  
Europe  are  likely  to  remain  unsettled  through  roughly  the  first  half  of  next  year  
before  starting   to  improve,  the  timing   of  such  a  turnaround  cannot  be  predicted  
with  any  confidence.   Against  the  backdrop   of  very  fragile  financial  conditions   in  
Europe,  decelerating   econ omic  activity   around   the  world,  and  weak  confidence  
of  households   and  firms,  the  risks  associated   with  our  outlook  for  Europe  and  its  
consequences   for  the  U.S.  economy   appear  outsized.   Accordingly,  the   
“European  Crisis  with  Severe  Spillovers”  scenario  presented  in  the  Risks  and  
Uncertainty   section  explores   the  implications   of  a  more  substantial  deterioration   
in  Europe  for  the  U.S.  outlo ok.   Alternatively,  European  policymakers  could  
implement  a  credible  and  decisive  plan  that  restores  confidence  sooner  than  we  
anticipate,   and  these  actions  would  likely  spur  a  much  faster  economic  recovery.   
The  possible  implications   for  the  U.S.  outlook  are  explored  in  the  “Faster  
European  Recovery”  scenario.

Interest Rates 
Even though the yield on 10-year Treasury securities has change d little, on net, 
since the October Tealbook, we have lowered its projected path this round.  In the near 
term, the downward revision reflects our thinki ng that sluggish progress toward resolving 
the European debt crisis will prompt greater safe-haven demand for Treasury securities in coming quarters.  And, with real GDP now proj ected to barely outpace  its potential rate 
over the medium term, we have flattened the co ntour of the 10-year Treasury yield a little 
over the next two years. 
That said, as in previous projections, we expect the 10- year Treasury yield to rise 
markedly from the middle of next year through the end of 2013, ending that year at 
3½ percent—1½ percentage points above its cu rrent level.  This projected increase 
reflects the movement of the valuation wi ndow through the period of near-zero short-
term interest rates, a grad ual waning of the effects of nonconventional monetary policy, 
and an unwinding of safe-haven demands as ap prehensions related to  the European debt 
crisis eventually ab ate and the U.S. economic recovery gains a firmer footing. 
Spreads on BBB-rated corporate bonds and conforming fixed-rate mortgages have 
not changed much, on net, since the Octobe r Tealbook.  These spread s are currently well 
above their typical levels, and, as in previous forecasts, we expect them to narrow gradually over the medium term.  However,  given the less sanguine  outlook for progress 
on the European front in the near term, both spreads are now expected to be roughly flat 
over the next few quarters before narrowing further out.  Coupled with our forecast for 
Treasury rates, these assumptions imply a mode rate increase in yields on these private 
instruments over the next two years.   
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
Broad U.S. stock price indexes have exhi bited considerable volatility recently, 
reflecting the sometimes pronounced anxiety among investors about the European debt 
crisis; they now stand about 1 percent higher than expect ed in the October Tealbook.  
However, given our more pessimistic view of  the European situation, we have lowered 
our projection for U.S. stock prices a little ov er the projection period.  We now expect the 
U.S. equity premium to be essentially flat through the middle of next year and then to 
begin narrowing as investors gain confid ence that European authorities will make 
progress toward putting sovere ign debt on a more sustainable path as well as toward 
guarding against major default.  In all, the level of  stock prices is projected to be more 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook

than 3 percent lower than in the October Tealbook by the middle of 2012, narrowing to 
almost 2 percent lower by the end of 2013.     
According to the latest data, home prices have continued to edge down in recent 
months by a touch m
ore than we expected.  We reacted by shaving the level of home 
prices throughout the projection period.  Our forecast calls for the CoreLogic home price 
index to decrease 1 percent in 2012 and to be about unchanged in 2013.   
Fiscal Policy 
We have changed our fiscal policy a ssumptions and now assume that the 
Congress will extend for one year both the 2 percentage point payr oll tax reduction for 
employees and the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program.  We had 
previously assumed that the payroll tax reduction would expire at the end of this year and 
that the EUC benefits would phase out over the course of 2012.  Our other fiscal policy 
assumptions are unchanged:  We continue to assume that discretionary spending 
beginning in fiscal year 2012 will be restrained  by the caps set in the Budget Control Act, 
and that additional measures will be put in place to reduce the budget deficit by 
$1.2 trillion in fiscal 2013 through 2021, consiste nt with the spending sequester triggered 
by the failure of the so-called supercommitt ee.  On our revised assumptions, we now 
expect federal fiscal policy to impose restra int of only about ¼ pe rcentage point on the 
growth of real GDP in 2012; the remaining restraint reflects the winding down of earlier 
stimulus-related policies and the beginning of th e fiscal restraint from the Budget Control 
Act.  In 2013, federal fiscal pol icy is anticipated to impose a dr ag of 1 percentage point of 
GDP; this drop is larger than in the Oct ober Tealbook, reflecting the expiration of the 
payroll tax cut and EUC program.    
The markdown in economic activity and our new policy assumptions imply a 
forecast for the unified budget deficit that is a little larger than in the October projection.  
However, we continue to expect the budget de ficit to narrow over the forecast period as 
fiscal policy tightens and as tax revenues are boosted by the gradual pickup in the pace of 
economic activity.  The budget deficit in fi scal 2011 was $1.3 tril lion (8½ percent of 
GDP), and we expect it to decline to about  $900 billion (5½ percen t of GDP) in fiscal 
2013.  Federal debt held by the public is proj ected to rise to about 75 percent of GDP 
over this period.

Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
We expect that foreign real GDP will e xpand at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in 
the current quarter, down from a 3¾ percen t third-quarter pace.  The anticipated 
slowdown this quarter in part reflects the wa ning of several fact ors that temporarily 
boosted growth last quarter, including the econo mic recovery from the earlier disaster in 
Japan.  The slowing this quarter is also ex acerbated by the effects of floods in Thailand,  
which disrupted economic activity in that country and supply chains throughout Asia.  As 
discussed earlier, weak economic data and th e expectation that fina ncial tensions will 
persist have led us to revise down signif icantly our forecast for European economic 
activity, and we now expect euro-area GDP to contract this  quarter and throughout 2012.  
Economic growth in the emerging market econo mies (EMEs) is expected to slow to a 
moderate pace during the forecast period, larg ely because of weakening external demand, 
even as domestic demand continues to provide  solid support.  In all, the projection for 
overall foreign output growth is down near ly ½ percentage poin t per year over the 
forecast period relative to th e October Tealbook.  Foreign re al GDP is expected to 
increase about 2½ percent next year and th en move up to a 3 percent gain in 2013 as 
financial tensions eventually  abate and the euro-area econom y slowly recuperates.   
Since the previous Tealbook, the dollar has appreciated against most major 
currencies, likely as a reflection of increased  financial stress in Europe.  Going forward, 
we project the broad real dollar to depreci ate 1½ percent in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013, 
with most of this decline concentrated  against the emerging market currencies.  
Compared with the previous Tealbook, we have lessened the pace of dollar depreciation 
in 2012, as strains within the eu ro area continue to support the dollar, and have increased 
the rate of depreciation in 2013, when these fina ncial stresses are expect ed to abate.  On 
average over the forecast period, the level of  the broad real dollar is almost 2½ percent 
higher than we projected in the October Tealbook. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
The prices of near-dated futures contract s for Brent crude changed little since the 
previous Tealbook; accordingly, our forecast for the price of imported oil is also little 
changed in the near term.1  We project the price of imported oil to decline about $9 per 
1 The spot price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has risen about $8 per barrel since 
the time of the October Tealbook, closing at $101 per barrel on D ecember 5.  This increase largely 
reflected the mid-November announcement of plans to reverse the flow of a key pipeline currently 
delivering oil from the Gulf Coast into Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI crude.  This

barrel over the forecast period, ending 2013 at about $95 per barrel, in line with 
expectations of continued supply growth and only moderate increases in demand.  By the 
end of 2013, this forecast is about $6 per barrel below the forecast in the previous 
Tealbook.  The projected path is also a bit below the one evident in futures prices, 
reflecting our adjustment for a global growth outlook that is weaker than the consensus 
among outside forecasters.  
The broad index of nonfuel commodity prices  that we follow has fallen m ore than 
3 percent since the time of th e October Tealbook, largely on account of lower prices for 
agricultural products.  Field crops, including corn, soybeans,  and wheat, recorded some  
of the steepest drops, as the negative effect  of weaker demand prospects was reinforced 
by an improved global supply outlook.  Overall,  we expect nonfuel commodity prices to 
decline slightly further through 2013. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
Real GDP is projected to advance at an average pace of 2½ percent in the second 
half of the year, the same as in the October Tealbook.  Consumer spending appears to be 
a little firmer than we expected, but inve ntory accumulation and defense spending are 
likely to be weaker.  Our forecast calls for re al GDP to rise at an annual rate of about 
2 percent in the first quarter , down ¼ percentage point from the October Tealbook.  This 
projection reflects the weaker prospects for net exports and domestic demand in light of 
the European situation and the lower level of  disposable income, whic h is partly offset by 
the extension of the payroll tax cut and EUC benefits.   
The Labor Market  
Overall, the news about conditions in the labor market has been a bit more 
encouraging than we anticipated in the Octobe r forecast.  In particular, the unemployment 
rate fell 0.4 percentage point in November to 8.6 percent.  Although we think that this 
decline likely exaggerates the improvement in underlying conditions, we do take some  
signal from it.  We expect the unemploymen t rate to tick back up to 8.8 percent in 
December, which is below the 9.1 percent rate we had projected last Tealbook.  
Meanwhile, the news from the establis hment survey has been close to our 
expectations, with privat e nonfarm payroll employment  rising 130,000 per month, on 
reversal will help to alleviate the supply glut of cr ude oil in the Midwest and w ill better integrate WTI with 
global markets.

average, in October and November.  Looki ng forward, we now project that private 
employers will add 150,000 jobs per month from December through March, about the 
same pace of hiring as in the previous Tealbook.  With state and local governments 
expected to make further cuts to payrolls in response to budget pressures, total payroll 
employment is expected to increase about  125,000 per month through March.  In light of 
these modest gains in employment, we e xpect the unemployment rate to average 
8.8 percent through the first quarter. 
The Industrial Sector 
We expect manufacturing out put to rise only modestly  this quarter and next.  
Outside the motor vehicle supply chain, the pace of activity has been sluggish in recent 
months, and the available near-term indicat ors of manufacturing production remain 
lackluster on balance.  In contrast, automobile  dealers’ inventories are lean and we expect 
motor vehicle production to step up this quarter and next, rou ghly in line with 
manufacturers’ assembly schedul es.  (Disruptions associated  with flooding in Thailand 
are expected to have only a small effect on ve hicle assemblies.)  In total, we now expect 
manufacturing output to rise at an annual rate of about 2¾ percent on average over the 
fourth and first quarters, slightly weak er than the October Tealbook forecast.  
Household Spending  
Incoming indicators of consumer spending in the fourth qua rter have been 
somewhat firmer than we had been expec ting.  Sales of light vehicles averaged 
13.4 million units at an annual rate in Octobe r and November, a bit higher than projected 
in the previous Tealbook.  In addition, reta il sales in October were  noticeably stronger 
than expected, and some indicators suggest sa les growth in November was solid as well.  
As a result, we now project that real PCE will rise at an annual rate of about 2½ percent 
in the current quarter, ½ percentage point faster than in the October Tealbook.   
This pace of spending, however, seems stronger than can be explained by its usual 
determinants.  Revised data indicate that DPI last quarter was substantially lower than we 
had expected, and indicators of consumer se ntiment remain very low, even though they 
are up from their recent troughs.  The dow nward revision to income restrains our 
projection of consumption expenditures going forward, but the change in fiscal policy 
assumptions supports it.  All told, we expect  real PCE to rise at  an annual rate of 
2¼ percent next quarter, just a bit slower than in the fourth quarter and about ½ percentage point faster th an in the previous Tealbook.

Residential construction remains depressed.  Available data for starts, permits, 
and home sales through October continue to  show no meaningful upturn in housing 
demand since activity bottomed out at the end of the recession.  Although affordability  
has increased, many potential buyers  either lack the down paym ent and credit history to 
qualify for loans or are discouraged by ongoi ng uncertainty about future income and 
employment.  Moreover, new housing construction continues to be held down by the 
considerable overhang of vacant homes and by tight credit availability for builders.  
Accordingly, we expect single-family starts to continue to track sideways over the next 
few months at an annual rate  of 430,000 units, similar to r ecent Tealbook projections.  In 
contrast, in response to increased demand for apartments and falling vacancy rates, 
multifamily starts have been moving up slowly in recent quarters, albeit from very low 
levels.  We expect this gradua l improvement to continue.    
Business Investment  
Recent data suggest that real spending  on equipment and software (E&S) has 
softened considerably in recent months, about as expected.  After rising at an annual rate 
of 16 percent in the third quarter, real inve stment in E&S is projected to increase 
3 percent in the current quarter.  Moreover,  forward-looking indicators, including capital 
spending plans, analysts’ earnings expect ations for capital goods producers, and 
corporate bond spreads, have all become more  downbeat of late and point to continued 
near-term weakness in E&S.  As a result, we expect spending to be a bout flat in the first 
quarter of next year.  In th e previous Tealbook, we expected E&S to register gains at an 
annual rate of about 3 percent, on average, over the fourth and first quarters.  
Business outlays on nonresidential structur es rose at double-digit rates in the 
second and third quarters.  However, outside  the drilling and mini ng sector, that rapid 
pace seems unlikely to be sustained given the unfavorable conditions facing the sector, including high vacancy rates, low property values, and tight lending conditions.  
Moreover, the architectural bill ings index—a useful indicato r of building activity two to 
three quarters out—continues to register read ings consistent with spending declines.  
Nonetheless, recent construction data have been a bit more upbeat than we had expected, and we have boosted our near-term projection as a result.  Meanwhile, activity in the 
drilling and mining sector has continued to rise at a brisk pace in r ecent quarters, driven 
by the high price of crude oil a nd by new techniques that have raised the profitability of  
drilling for oil and natural gas.  We expect these innovations to con tinue to support robust 
growth in this sector over the next few quarters.

As noted earlier, motor vehicle dealers’ stocks are still lean, and we expect 
automakers to rebuild inventories slowly ove r the next few months.  Elsewhere, the pace 
of inventory investment slowed sharply in the third quarter, and inventory stocks look 
fairly well aligned with sales.  Therefore, we now expect inventory investment outside of 
motor vehicles to proceed at a moderate pa ce in the near term.  As a result, after 
subtracting considerably more than we exp ected from the growth of GDP in the third 
quarter, the contribution of i nventory investment to the growth of real GDP over the 
fourth and first quarters is a bit hi gher than in the previous Tealbook. 
Government  
Incoming data suggest that real federal purchases will likely decline this quarter 
as a result of a dip in defense spending.  We  expect purchases to rebound in the first 
quarter as defense spending returns to a le vel we judge to be more in line with 
appropriations.  Meanwhile, data for the state and local sector have come in broadly as 
expected at the time of the October Tealbook and provide some tentative signs that the 
rate of decline in real purc hases is moderating.  Since Jul y, employment has declined by 
an average of about 10,000 jobs per month, co mpared with declines of roughly 30,000 in 
the first half of the year.  Similarly, following extremely sharp decreases in real 
construction spending in the first half of th e year, data through October point toward a 
flattening out of these expenditures in the s econd half.  As in the October Tealbook, we 
project that real purchases by state and local gov ernments will decline at an annual rate of 
about 1 percent this quarter and next.   
Foreign Trade  
Real exports of goods and services are expect ed to increase at an average pace of 
6 percent in the current quarte r and the first quarter of ne xt year, supported by continued 
foreign growth, particularly in the EMEs, a nd past depreciation of the dollar.  This 
forecast is about 1½ percentage points lower th an in the previous Tealbook:  The path of 
the dollar is now higher and our outlook for fo reign GDP lower in light of the European 
crisis.   
After moving up at an annual rate of onl y ½ percent in the third quarter, real 
imports of goods and services are expected to rise at an average rate of about 4 percent 
over the current quarter and the first quarter of next year.  The pickup in import growth in 
part reflects a rebound in oil imports followi ng a sharp decline in the third quarter 
because of a large release from the Strategi c Petroleum Reserve.  The acceleration also

incorporates our view that non-oil imports w ill recover from their surprising third-quarter 
weakness.  
All together, we expect the external s ector to add ¼ percen tage point to GDP 
growth in the current qu arter and to be about neutral for gr owth in the first quarter of next 
year.  Altho
ugh this forecast is a touch more positive in the current quarter, the projection 
for the contribution in the first quarter of  next year has been revised down by over 
¼ percentage point.  
Prices and Wages  
Recent data on consumer prices have been  broadly consistent with our October 
forecast.  After rising at annual rates of 3½ percent in the first half of the year and 
2¼ percent in the third quarter, total PCE prices are now expected to edge up just 
¾ percent in the current quart er and 1½ percent in the first quarter of 2012, as energy 
prices turn down after their first-half surge and both food and core prices continue to 
decelerate.    
With regard to core consumer prices, the latest data reinforce our view that the 
faster pace of inflation evident in the spring and summer was mainly due to transitory 
factors, including the pass-through of the first-half surge in commodity and import prices 
as well as a boost to motor vehicle prices  that stemmed from post-earthquake supply 
shortages.  Indeed, the prices of new motor vehicles have already decelerated noticeably, 
as have the prices for most other durable goods.  We now project that core PCE price 
inflation will slow to 1 percent in the current  quarter from an average of about 2¼ percent 
in the second and third quarters.  The f ourth-quarter projection, which is about ½ 
percentage point below our forecast in the previous Tealbook, is held down by weak readings for prices for medical services in Oc tober that we do not e xpect to continue, and 
our forecast for core inflation in the first quar ter of next year is unchanged at 1½ percent. 
After moving up rapidly earlier  in the year, consumer energy prices declined in 
October and are expected to show further declines in November and December; this contour mainly reflects the rise and subsequent reversal in the price of imported crude oil.  
(As noted earlier, the recent run-up in the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil 
reflects idiosyncratic factors and has not been  matched by prices of imported grades.)  
Similarly, we expect the recent deceleration in  food prices to conti nue this quarter and 
next, as declines in crop pri ces since the spring continue to  pass through to retail prices.

The latest readings on labor compensation have come in considerably lower than 
we expected in the October Tealbook.  Base d on the BEA’s revised estimates of private 
compensation, the Productivity and Costs (P &C) measure of hourly compensation now 
appears to have edged lower in the sec ond and third quarters, whereas the October 
projection assumed it had increased at an annual rate of about 2 percent over this period.  
In addition, the employment cost index (ECI) for private industry workers decelerated 
last quarter to an increase of 1½ percent, almost 1 percentage point  lower than in the 
October Tealbook as payments for benefits slow ed considerably more than expected.  As 
these data tend to be noisy, we have not signi ficantly revised our co mpensation in light of 
the weaker incoming data.  We continue to project that both measures of hourly 
compensation will rise at an average annual rate in the neighborhood of 2¼ percent over 
the next couple of quarters. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
We have lowered our projection for real  GDP growth ¼ percentage point in 2012, 
to 2¼ percent, and ¾ percentage point in 2013, to 2½ percent.  These revisions reflect the 
interplay of a number of factors.  Most important, developments in Europe are now 
expected to weigh on U.S. economic growth  throughout the medium term.  Demand is 
also being held down by the much lower le vel of personal income as well as by our 
trimming of potential output gr owth.  Finally, the assumed ex tensions of the payroll tax 
cut and EUC benefits partially offset these downward revisions, adding about 
½ percentage point to real GDP growth  in 2012 and deducting a somewhat smaller 
amount from 2013.2  Absent these fiscal policy cha nges, we would have projected GDP 
growth to be just 1¾ percent in 2012 and to step up to 2¾ percent in 2013. 
Since the October Tealbook, we have lowe red our projection for the contribution 
of net exports to GDP growth by about ¼ perc entage point on average over the projection 
period, as the recession in Eu rope and the higher path for the dollar weigh on export 
demand.  Real export growth is expected to  average about 5¼ percent in 2012 and 2013, 
down from 6¾ percent in the October Tealbook.  R eal imports are projected to increase at 
a 4 percent pace in 2012 and 2013, consistent with the pace of U.S. demand growth.  In all, net exports are now expected to ma ke no contribution to GDP growth over the 
medium term.   
2 Because consumption responds only gradually to disposable income, the extension of the payroll 
tax cut still has a small positive effect on the level of GDP at the end of 2013.

The current forecast incorporates more-p essimistic projections for income and 
confidence.  As a result, we have lowered our forecast of PCE growth over the medium 
term by an average of almost ½ percentage po int per year.  In addi tion, the revisions to 
our fiscal policy assumptions have changed th e contour of the consumption forecast.  The 
October Tealbook projected a noticeable acceleration of consumer spending between 
2012 and 2013, but with the payroll tax cut a nd EUC benefits now lasting through the 
end of 2012, we now project real PCE to rise  at a pace of around 2¼ percent in both 
years.   
In light of the sharp downward revisi on to household incom e and surprisingly 
strong recent data on consumer spending, the personal saving rate is projected to average 
4¼ percent in the current quarter, down from  5 percent at the start of this year.  The 
projected path of the saving rate is buffeted by changes in fiscal policy, which affect the 
saving rate because of the gradual response of consumption to tax changes.  Excluding 
the effects of fiscal policy, the saving rate is expected to rise about ¾ percentage point 
over the projection period as consumption comes into better alignment with income. 
The downward revisions to output and the heightened uncertainty in the current  
forecast are expected to weigh on the business sector as well.  Although many 
corporations are flush with cash and have ready access to capital markets, we do not 
expect firms to undertake any substantial increases in their pr oductive capacity until 
financial conditions and business sentiment im prove later next year.  As a result, we 
expect real E&S outlays to ri se just 3 percent in 2012 and 6½ percent in 2013.  With this 
subdued level of investment, the growth ra te of the capital stoc k remains quite low 
throughout the forecast period.   
We continue to see no meaningful re covery in the housing sector over the 
medium term.  Households’ uncertainty about their future income and about the direction 
of house prices, combined with the prevalen ce of underwater mortag es and tight credit 
conditions, are likely to continue to restrain demand through the medium term.  
Moreover, to the extent demand is expected to  improve, much of the increase will likely 
be satisfied by the outsized stock of v acant houses, which, given the pipeline of 
delinquent and foreclosed homes, should remain  very large.  As a result, single-family 
housing starts are projected to move up to an annual rate of only 550,000 units by the end 
of 2013—far below the pace we think is c onsistent with the longer-run demand for 
housing.

Similarly, we see few prospects for an appreciable gain in business spending on 
nonresidential structures ex cluding drilling and mining over the medium term.  The 
headwinds facing this sector have not diminished materially, and we do not expect them 
to do so in coming quarters.  In contrast, we have become somewhat more optimistic 
about drilling and mining ac tivity based on an assessment that improvements in 
technologies are likely to provide a more prol onged boost to spending. 
Finally, we continue to expect restra ined governm ent spending to hold down 
economic growth over the medium term.  At  the federal level, real purchases are 
projected to be about flat in 2012 and then to fall 4 percent in 2013 as discretionary 
spending is restrained by the caps in th e Budget Control Act and expenditures for 
overseas military operations decl ine.  In the state and local sector, budgets are expected to 
remain extremely tight:  State tax revenues are rising at a solid pace, but the federal 
stimulus grants are being phased out and tax co llections (especially property taxes) at the 
local level have been weak.  Given thes e tight budget conditi ons, state and local 
government purchases are expected to be  about flat over the next two years. 
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR  MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU  
Even discounting somewhat the November reading on the unemployment rate, 
unemployment has declined roughly ¾ percenta ge point over the past year despite only 
modest growth of real activit y, suggesting that the growth of  potential output has been 
lower than we had previously estimated.  A ccordingly, we have reduced our estimate of 
potential GDP growth by 0.4 percentage point in 2011; we also nudged down our 
estimates of potential GDP growth in 2012 and 2013, reflecting both the lower 
investment spending in this projection and indications that trend multifactor productivity 
may be expanding a bit more slowly than we had previously estimat ed.  We now assume  
that potential GDP will increase roughly 2 percent in both 2012 and 2013.  The NAIRU 
is assumed stay at 6 percent through 2013.3   
3 In light of our revised fiscal policy assumptions, we have boosted our estimate of the “effective” 
NAIRU (which includes the influence of extended and emergency unemployment benefits) to 6.4 percent at 
the end of 2012, up ¼ percentage point from the October Tealbook assumption. However, the gap between 
the effective NAIRU and the traditional NAIRU is nearly gone by the end of 2013 when these benefits are 
almost fully wound down.

Productivity and the Labor Market 
We estimate that productivity increased at an annual rate of about 2¼ percent in 
the third quarter after edging lower in the first half of the year, and we project that it will 
increase at an annual rate of about 2 percent in  the current quarter.  This projection leaves 
the level of productivity at the end of this year somewhat above our estimate of its trend, 
and we expect this gap to na rrow over the forecast period.  
With little acceleration in economic activity projected over the medium term, we 
now expect the pace of private employment gr owth to be mostly flat as well, with 
monthly job gains averaging 170,000 over 2012 and 2013.  Meanwhile, we expect state 
and local employment to conti nue to decline in 2012, though by less than in recent years, 
and to rise modestly in 2013, as budget pressu res diminish somewhat.  With these tepid 
employment gains, the joble ss rate edges down to about 8¼ percent by the end of 2013; 
more than half of this decline is accounted for by effect of the phase out of EUC benefits 
on labor force participation.  
For a discussion of recent developments  and prospects in employment at small 
businesses, see the box “Small and New Business Employment and Financing.” 
Resource Utilization 
The recent unexpected decline in the unemployment rate and our revisions to 
potential GDP imply that the economy currently has a bit less slack than we assumed in 
the October Tealbook.  But the downward revi sion to our forecast of economic activity 
also means that the slack is taken up even more gradually than in the previous projection.  
By our estimate, the unemployment rate in th e current quarter is 2½ percentage points 
above the effective NAIRU; at the end of 2013, th e gap is expected to remain elevated at 
2¼ percentage points.  This extended period of labor market slack is likely to be 
associated with a continuation of other a dverse labor market conditions, including below-
trend labor force participation and an unusually large concentration of workers 
experiencing long-term unemployment spells. 
While we admit to considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of slack in labor 
and product markets, a wide range of other labor  market indicators also supports the view 
that, despite some recent improvement, slack re mains quite substantial.  (See the exhibit 
“How Much Slack Is There in the Labor Mark et?”)  For example, the deterioration in 
household perceptions of job availability, as  measured by the Conference Board survey,

Small  and  New  Business   Employment  and  Financing   
Both  employment   at  and  lending  to  small  businesses  declined   during  the  recession,   and  neither  has  
yet  shown  signs  of  recovering.    Although   these   two  developments   are  linked,  the  causal  relations  
are  not  clear:   Tight  credit  conditions   may  have  contributed   to  the  weak  employment   performance,   
but  we  think  that  they  probably   played  only  a  limited  role.   However,  reduced  household   net  
wealth   may  have  held  down  employment   at  start‐ups  and  young  businesses.  
Employment   at  both   small   and  large  businesses   fell  sharply,  and  by  similar  degrees,  from  their  pre‐
recession   levels  (the  lower‐left  figure),  whereas  historically,   large  firms  have  tended  to  shed  
proportionately   more  jobs  during  recessions.    While  employment   at  larger  businesses   began   to  pick  
up  modestly   by  early  2011,  employment   at  small  firms  remained   flat;  historically,   small  firms  have  
tended  to  grow  faster  than   large  ones  in  the  early  stages  of  recoveries.1  
Commercial   lending  by  domestic   banks  also
  declined   in  the  wake  of  the  financial  crisis.   According   
to  data   from  the  Call  Reports,  the  outstanding   value  of  large  loans  to  businesses   began  to  turn  
back  up  in  late  2010;  by  the  third  quarter  of  this  year,  this  value  had  nearly  returned  to  its  previous  
peak  level  (the  lower‐ right  figure).    However,  the  same  has  not  been  true  for  small  loans:   the  
outstanding   value  of  small  loans  to  businesses   (a  proxy  for  loans  to  small  businesses)  continued   to  
decline  through  the  third   quarter  of  this  year.  
Although  employment   and  borrowing   tend  to  move  together,  determining   the  causal  chain  from  
one  to  the  other   is  difficult.   Poor  customer  demand  likely  explains  most  of  the  weak  performance  
of  small  firms  as  well  as  their  larger  counterparts.   Overwhelmingly,  businesses   in  the  National  
Federation  of  Independent  Business  (NFIB)  survey   and  elsewhere  report  that  the  most  important

problem  they  face  is  weak  sales.   If  firms  anticipate   continued   slow  sales  growth,  then  they  may  be  
reluctant   to  hire  additional   employees   or  to  borrow   funds.    Indeed,  the  share  of  firms  in  the  NFIB  
survey  that  reported   having  any  borrowing   needs,  met  or  unmet,  has  fallen  substantially   since  2007  
and  remains  low  by  historical   standards   (the  black  line  in  the  lower‐left  figure).   At  the  same  time,  
financing   for  small   businesses   did  become  increasingly   difficult  to  obtain  over   this  period,   due  to  
both  tightened   lending  standards   and  borrowers’   weakened   balance  sheets.   The  net  percentage  
of  firms  in  the  NFIB  survey  reporting   that  credit  was  more  difficult  to  obtain  than  in  the  prior  three  
months  rose  markedly   during  the  recession,   and,  although  it  has  fallen  some  since  its  peak,  it  
remains  quite  elevated  (the  red  line).   Overall,  tight  credit   conditions   for  existing  small  businesses   
may  have  been  a  contributing   factor  to  the  employment  problem,   but  we  think  it  likely  played  only  
a  minor  independent   role.  
Potentially   mor e  important   is  the  role  played  by  new  and  young  firms.   A  dramatic   slowing  in  net  job  
creation  at  new  and  young  firms  (the  black  line  in  the  lower‐right  figure)  accounted   for  much  of  the  
anemic  employment  performance  at  small  firms  from  2006  to  2009.2   And  the  limited  data  available  
after  2009  suggest  that  job  creation  at  such  businesses   has  remained   weak  relative  to  historical   
norms.   Yet,  prior  to  this  recession,   job  creation  at  new  and  young  firms  varied  little  with  the  
business  cycle.   Why  might  this  cycle  have  been  different?   One  possibility   is  that  difficulties   in  
funding  new  businesses   have  hampered   business  creation.   Data  from  the  2007  Survey  of  Business  
Owners  indicate  that  at  least  60  percent  of  business  owners  used  personal  and  family  savings  or  
home  equity  to  start  their   businesses,  while  only  11  percent  used  bank  loans  to  do  so.   In  the  
aggregate,  household   net  worth  remains  well  below  its  pre‐recessi on  level,  reducing   this  major  
source  of  funding  and  possibly  holding  back  employment   growth  significantly.    Moreover,   we  
project  household   net  worth  to  recover  only  modestly   in  coming  years,  suggesting   that  funding  
troubles  may  continue  to  weigh  on  start‐ups  and  young  businesses.  
2 Historically, new and young firms have contributed disproportionately to net job creation, and the vast 
majority of these businesses are small. According to Census Bureau data, businesses less than three years old 
created almost 40 percent of all net new jobs from 1978 to 2009 despite accounting for less than 10 percent of 
employment.

is well aligned with the movements in the une mployment gap, as is the marked decline in 
the percent of small businesses reporting that  job openings are “hard to fill.”  Similarly, 
the percent of workers who are working pa rt time for economic reasons—workers who, 
almost by definition, are underutilized due to l ack of demand—rose to  a historically high 
share of employment in 2008 a nd remains elevated still. 
We expect slack in the industrial sector to be taken up somewhat less quickly over 
the medium
 term than in the previous projection, as gains in industrial production are 
tempered by weaker paths of domestic spending and export demand.  As a result, at the 
end of 2013, the factory operating rate is now forecast to be 1¼ percentage points lower 
than in the previous projection while th e still sizable GDP and unemployment gaps 
prevailing at that time are only a touch narrower. 
Prices and Compensation  
We expect that the wide margin of sl ack in resource utilization, along with low 
rates of price inflation, will continue to restrain labor costs over the forecast period.  Both 
the P&C measure of nonfarm hourly compensati on and ECI are projected to rise about 
2¼ percent per year in 2012 and 2013, unchanged from the October Tealbook.  
Combined with the moderate gains in productiv ity that we project, these increases in 
compensation imply only a small rise in unit labor costs.  
Prices for imported core goods are expect ed to decline abou t ¾ percent in the 
current quarter and the first quarter of ne xt year, reflecting both lower prices for 
commodities as well as the recent appreciation of  the dollar.  Core import price inflation 
is expected to pick up gradually in 2012, as  commodity prices flatten out and the dollar 
starts depreciating, and then run at about a 1½ percent rate in 2013.  This forecast is about 
½ percentage point lower in 2012 and 2013, on average, than in th e October Tealbook.  
Median inflation expectations from  the Michigan survey  have moved down 
somewhat at both the 1-year and 5-to-10-year  horizon since the s econd quarter, and long-
term expectations now stand at the lower edge  of the range they have moved in for most 
of the past 10 years.  In addition, inflati on compensation 5 to 10 years ahead derived from  
TIPS spreads has fallen since the middle of the year.  
As in previous Tealbooks, we anticipate that subdued labor costs and low levels 
of resource utilization will put downward pressure on core PCE inflation over the 
projection period, but that fu rther disinflation will be checked by stable inflation

expectations.  We continue to project that core PCE inflation will be about 1½ percent in 
both 2012 and 2013, the same as in the Octobe r Tealbook.  With energy prices expected 
to edge down over the medium term, headline infl ation runs just a bit below core in both 
2012 and 2013.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast through 2016 using the FRB/US model and 
staff assessments of long-run supply-side condi tions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  The 
contour of the long-run outlook depe nds on the following key assumptions: 
  Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long run, 
consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections provided by 
FOMC participants at the November meeting. 
  The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities follow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B.  The projected longer-run decline in the System’s holdings is forecast to contribut e about 30 basis points to the rise in 
the 10-year Treasury yi eld from 2013 to 2016. 
  Beyond 2013, risk premiums on corpor ate equities and bonds decline 
gradually to normal levels and credit av ailability improves somewhat further. 
  The federal government budget deficit (N IPA basis) narrows from 5½ percent 
of GDP in 2013 to 4 percent of GDP in  2016.  This narrowing reflects both 
the effects of the economic recovery on tax receipts and budgetary restraint 
consistent with this summer’s Budget Control Act (including the $1.2 trillion 
of spending cuts triggered by the failur e of the so-called supercommittee to 
propose a deficit reduction plan). 
  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar is assumed to decline 2 percent 
per year from 2014 to 2016.  The price of crude oil is roughly flat beyond 
2013.  Foreign real GDP expands, on aver age, 3½ percent per year from 2014 
through 2016, slightly a bove its trend rate. 
  The NAIRU remains at 6 percent in 2014 and then declines to 5½ percent by 
late 2016 as the functioning of the labor market gradually improves.  Potential 
GDP expands 2½ percent per year on average from 2014 to 2016.

The economy enters 2014 with  output still considerably  below its potential, the 
unemployment rate well above the projected NAIRU, and inflation below the assumed 
objective.  In the long-run forecast, improvi ng confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and 
supportive financial conditions enable real GDP to rise at an average annual rate of 
3¾ percent from 2014 to 2016.  With actual outpu t expanding faster th an potential, labor 
market conditions improve; nevertheless, th e unemployment rate, at 6½ percent at the  
end of 2016, is still 1 percen tage point above the assume d NAIRU.  With downward 
pressures from slack gradually abating after 2013, inflation edges up to 1.6 percent by 
2016.  The federal funds rate rises above ¼ percent at the end of 2014 and reaches 
2¾ percent by the end of 2016.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Prospects for the  global economy depend critically on the course of the financial 
crisis in  Europe.  After measures  agreed  upon at the late October  EU summit f  ailed to  
gain traction , financial tensions rebounded  amid growing doubts about  the  ability of  
Europe ’s authorities  to construct a credible backstop .  (See the box “Recent Policy and 
Market  Developments in the Euro Area.”)   At the time of this writing,  markets have 
improved a bit on hopes  that European le aders will agree to  significant actions  at  their  
meeting this Friday ( December 9 ), but  we believe  that, after the dust settles, substantial 
doubts will remain about  the specifics and  effectiveness  of any announced program .  
Accordingly, we expect that  inve stor confidence  will diminish  once again  in coming  
months, forcing European policymakers to take even stronger actions to ward off defaults  
by a major country—for example, Italy or Spain—and convince markets  that the euro 
area will remain largely intact .  Even afterward, we expect it will take som e  time for  
investor confidence to be fully restored.   
Our expectation of  persistent heightened  tensions, together with accumulating  
weak economic data, has led us to revise down significantly our forecast for European  
economic activity ; we now project  euro -area GDP  will  contract  more  sharply this quarter, 
and we are extending the contraction  throughout 2012.  Given how fluid the situation is at  
present, there is some chance  that European leaders will take actions  that are more 
decisive and effective than we  currently anticipate, leading to  an earlier  easing of  
financial tensions and recovery of economic activity.  (S ee the “Faster European  
Recovery” scenario  in the Risks and Uncertainty s ection .)   By the same token,  however, 
there is also some chance that financial conditions could deteriorate much  more severely .  
(See the “European Crisis with Severe Spillovers ” scenario  also  in the Risks and 
Uncertaint y section.)  
Reflecting th e  implications of the  euro -area revisio n and the lower path  for  U.S. 
econom ic activit y, the projection for foreign output growth is nearly ½ percentage point  
lower over the forecast period  than in the October Tealbook.  In the  current quarter, w e 
estimate  that foreign real  GDP expanded  at an annual rate of 2¼  percent, down from a  
3¾ percent third -quarter  pace.  Th is slowdown is  broad based , owing to the contraction in 
Europe and the  waning of factors that temporarily  boosted growth last quarter, including  
the rebound from the earlier disaster in  Japan.  In addition, floods in Thailand disrupted

Recent  Policy  and  Market  Developments   in  the  Euro  Area  
Since  the  time  of  the  October  Tealbook,   European   policymakers   have  continued   to  
struggle  to  contain  the  region’s  fiscal  and  financial  stresses,  with  developments   
unfolding   in  three  phases.     
The  first  phase  occurred   in  late  October  when  euro‐area  leaders  announced   additional   
policies  designed   to  reduce  financial  tensions.    First,  euro‐area  leaders  agreed  on  a  
new  €130  billion  official  financing   package  for  Greece,  predicated   on  a  voluntary   debt  
restructuring   that  would  halve  the  face  value  of  private  claims  on  the  Greek  
government.    Second,  leaders  planned  to  leverage  the  remaining   €270  billion  in  
uncommitted   resources   of  the  European   Financial  Stability  Facility  (EFSF)  with   private‐
sector  funds  to  achieve   over  €1  trillion  in  capacity.   Third,  they  required  banks  to  reach   
a  9  percent  core  Tier  1  risk‐based  capital  ratio  by  mid‐2012,  with   public  capital  
injections   if  necessary.    In  anticipation   of  and  following   these  agreements,   markets  
rallied  around  the  world.  
The  second  phase  began  in  early  November   when  political  developments   in  Greece  
helped  extinguish  the  market  rally.    Then‐Prime  Minister  Papandreou   announced   plans  
for  a  referendum   on  Greece’s  EU–IMF  rescue   program  and  its  membership   in  the  euro  
area.   The  resulting  uncertainty   propelled   Greek  sovereign  spreads  to  new  euro‐ era  
records  and  fuelled  concerns   about  a  possible  breakup  of  the  euro  area.   In  the  wake  
of  severe  political  backlash,   Papandreou   cancelled   the  referendum   and  resigned,   to  be  
replaced  by  former  ECB  Vice  President  Papademos.   The  new  caretaker  government   is  
expected   to  receive  a  long‐delayed   €8  billion  disbursement   from  Greece’s  existing  EU– 
IMF  program   shortly,  but  negotiations   between  the  Greek  government   and  its  private  
creditors   regarding   debt  restructuring   have  been  fractious.    Insufficient   progress  in  
these  negotiations   or  on  austerity  measures   over  the  next  few  months  could  
jeopardize   the  new  EU–IMF  program,  which   would  again  fuel  speculation   that  Greece  
will  default  and  possibly  withdraw   from  the  euro  area.     
Had  a  credible  sovereign  backstop   already  been  in  place,  the  Greek  situation  would  
likely  have  had  limited  consequences   for  broader  markets.   However,  initial  euphoria  
about  the  October  plan   to  leverage  the  EFSF  quickly  gave  way  to  skepticism.   Outside   
investors   demonstrated   little  interest  in  participating   directly  in  this  scheme,  and  the  
EFSF  itself  has  had  difficulty  raising  funds.    As  a  result,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  EFSF,  
alone,  will  be  able  to  protect  Italy  and  Spain   from  a  major  run  on  their   debt.    
In  the  absence  of  a  credible  backstop,  investor  concerns   about  sovereign  default  and  
the  future  of  the  euro  area  snowballed.   Alarmingly,  market  pressures  spread   to  core  
euro‐area  economies,   where  Belgian  and  French  sovereign  spreads  hit  their  highest  
levels  in  decades,  and  even  Germany   had  a  poor   bond  auction   in  late  November.   In  
turn,  soaring  borrowing   costs  and  weakening   economic   conditions   contributed   to  the  
demise  of  governments  in  both  Italy  and  Spain.1   Although  the  new  governments    
1 As financial market strains on Italy escalated, Premier Berlusconi resigned under pressure from 
members of his own party. Former EU Commissioner Monti replaced him and formed a new cabinet 
of unelected technocrats. In Spain, national elections previously scheduled for November 20 
deposed the ruling center left party and gave an outright parliamentary majority to the main center
right party.

appear  committed   to  fiscal  austerity  and  structural   reform,   it  is  uncertain  whether   
they  will  be  able  to  meet  fiscal  targets  as  economic   conditions   weaken.    In  addition,   
investors   remained   concerned   that  the  combined   financing   needs  of  the  two  
governments   over  the  next  two  years  substantially   exceed  the  existing  resources   of  
the  EFSF  and  the  IMF.      
To  stem  the  spreading   panic,  calls  mounted   for  a  more  active  role  for  the  ECB  in  
funding  vulnerable  governments.   However,  both  the  ECB  and  German   authorities   
resisted  greater  ECB  involvement,   not  least  because  it  would  undermine   incentives   for  
embattled   governments   to  implement  fiscal  reforms.   The  European  Commission   
formally  evaluated   an  alternative  approach,   involving   the  issuance  of  Eurobonds   
guaranteed   by  the  euro  area  as  a  whole  and  stronger  centralized   authority   over  
national  budgets.    
The  third  phase  began  in  late  November,  when  investor  sentiment  improved  following   
the  November  30  announcement   of  coordinated   central  bank  action  on  liquidity  swap  
lines,  as  well  as  signs  that  euro‐area  policymakers   were  moving  toward  agreement  on  
more  aggressive  measures  to  address  the  crisis.   On  December  1,  ECB  President  Draghi   
reiterated  the  ECB’s  long‐standing  call  for  stronger  rules  governing   national  fiscal  
policies  and  noted   that  “other  elements  might  follow,  but  the  sequencing   matters.”2   
This  statement  was  widely  interpreted   as  a  hint  that  the  ECB  may  enhance  its  support  
for  vulnerable  governments,  provided   euro‐area  governments   sufficiently   strengthen   
fiscal  discipline.    On  December   5,  in  advance  of  the  December   9  European   leaders’  
summit,  German  Chancellor   Merkel  and  French  President  Sarkozy  announced   their  
support  for  more  automatic   sanctions   for  fiscally  profligate   countries   and  for  
advancing   the  launch  of  the  €500  billion  European   Stability  Mechanism   (ESM),  the  
permanent  euro‐area  financial  support  facility,  to  2012,  a  year  earlier  than  originally   
scheduled.   If  the  ESM  is  allowed  to  overlap  with  the  EFSF  until  that  temporary   facility  
expires  in  2013,  it  could  expand  the  overall  size  of  the  euro‐area  backstop.  
Provided   the  broader  set  of  European  leaders  endorses   these  proposals   at  their  
summit  on  December  9,  sentiment  may  further  improve  for  a  time.   However,  
implementing   these  measures   will  be  a  difficult  and  time‐consuming   process,  possibly  
involving   a  new  treaty  among  euro‐area  members  or  substantial   changes  to  the  
existing  EU  treaty.   We  expect  the  summit  agreement  to  be  just  a  first  step  toward  
credibly  binding  and  integrating   national  fiscal  policies.   Hence,  it  is  doubtful  that  the  
ECB  will  immediately   and  decisively   step  up  its  support  of  sovereign  funding  needs.   
Our  baseline  forecast  accordingly   assumes  that  until  financial  conditions   have  
worsened   considerably   further,  progress  toward  an  effective  policy  response  will  
remain  incremental   and  insufficient  to  durably  contain  the  crisis.

economic activity in that country  and supply chains throughout Asia.  Going forward, we  
project that f oreign real GDP  will increase about 2½  percent next  year and 3  percent in  
2013, as financial tensions e ventually  abate and the euro -area economy  recuperates.  
Foreign inflation edged up to an estimated 3½ percent in the current quarter, with  
c
onsumer prices  in the advanced  economies  rising  more than  we had anticipated.  We 
expect inflation abroad to slow to 2½ percent  next quarter and to 2¼ percent  over the 
remainder of the forecast period , as  pressure s  from  earlier  run-ups in commodity prices  
diminish  and  resource slack persists .  Concerns  about slowing  economic growth have led 
some foreign central banks, such as the ECB, the Central  Bank  of Brazil , and the  
People’s Bank of China  (PBOC) , to loosen monetary policy during the intermeeting  
period, and in some cases we expect further easing g  oing forward.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN  ECONOMIES  
Real GDP in the AFEs rose near ly 2¾ percent in the third quarter  after stalling in  
the second quarter.  Economic activity rebounded sharply in Canada and Japan, where  
temporary factors had  restrained second -quarter  output, but growth remained weak in the 
euro area.  Amid increased  uncertainty  about the resolution of the euro- area crisis and  
heightened financial stresses, data suggest that economic conditions in Europe  are 
worsening at a  faster pace than previously anticipated.  Consequently, we  now expect the  
euro area to experience a  moderate recession  this quarter  and during 2012, with 
significant spillovers to the global economy.   
We project that AFE  growth will step down to 1 percent in the  current quarter and 
slow further to  below ¾ percent in the  first half of 2012 before picking up to only  a 
1¾ percent pace by the end of 2013.  Relative to the  October  Tealbook forecast , this  
projection is ¾ percentage point lower in 2012 and ½ percentage point lower in 2013, 
primarily owing to  the bleaker outlook for Europe.  
Headline inflation in  the AFEs  is projected to rise to a 3 percent pace this quarter, 
significantly higher than projected in the previous Tealbook.  Amid substantial output  
gaps  and flat commodity  prices, AFE inflation is  projected  to slow to 1½ percent next  
quarter  and to average just above 1 percent over the remainder of the  forecast period.  In  
the context of weak  outlooks for  growth and inflation, we  anticipate  the major foreign  
central banks  will  further ease monetary  policy.

Euro Area  
Our assessment of the euro -area out look has worsened significantly, for three 
main  reasons.  First, as discussed below, incoming economic indicators have been 
disappointingly weak.  Second, during the intermeeting period, concerns  about sovereign 
risk  spilled over from the  euro -area periphery to the core  economies , increasing the  scope  
and severity  of the  crisis .  And third, the ongoing failure of European policymakers to 
take  decisive action s in the face of increasingly dangerous financial strains has reinforced 
our sense  that domestic political considerations will continue to constrain  the policy  
response to the crisis. 
Accord ingly,  even taking into account the progress of negotiations by euro- area 
leaders  evidenced this week,  our baseline scenario envisions  further intensification of the  
crisis in the months ahead.  We believe this  development  will u ltimately forc e European 
policymakers to overcome  more  of  the domestic political constraints that have hampered 
their efforts thus far.   In  particular, we expect the ECB eventually to assume a m uch 
larger role in providing liquidity to vulnerable  governments—possibly  via purchases of  
their bonds or by contributing to the financing of  an IMF program—in exchange for  
credible commitments  by euro -area  governments to stronger  governance over national  
fiscal policies.   These actions  should prevent catastrophic events such as  a wave of  
sovereign defaults or bank failures.  However, this  response is unlikely to  come in time to  
prevent a substantial recession and likely will not fully  alleviate investor  concerns .   
Data released since the October Tealbook point to a  further deterioration of  
economic conditions in the euro area .  Real GDP  grew just over ½ percent in the third 
quarter .  Economic a ctivity  was  even weaker  toward  the end of the  quarter , with 
industrial production f alling  sharply  in September  and manufacturing orders retrac ing to 
their October 2010 level .  Preliminary indicators for the fourth quarter point to a  
recession , with PMIs remain ing  firmly in contractionary territory  in November, and 
business and consumer  confidence  continuing to slide.  Labor market conditions  
worsened further, as  the  unemployment rate r ose in October to 10.3 percent, its highest  
level in more than 10 years.  
Against this backdrop of  disappointing  data and elevated financial stresses,  we 
now forecast a more severe and prolonged contraction.  We expect real GDP to fall  at a 
1 percent  rate this quarter, with the recession deepening i n the first half of next  year.   
With policymakers  eventually forced to  act in order to prevent a catastrophic event, we 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook   
  
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

expect  financial conditions  to gradually  normalize and confidence to improve, such that  
the recession slowly attenuates late in 2012.  Thereafter, we expect a modest recovery to  
take place, with real GDP growth rising to  a still below-trend 1 percent pace by the end of  
2013, as fiscal  austerity  remain s  a significant headwind .      
We estimate that euro -area inflation  picked up from 1½ percent in the third  
quarter to 4 percent in the fourth quarter.  This surprising swing in inflation appears to be 
due  in large part to seasonal adjustment issues and, we believe, does not reflect a rise in  
underlying price pressures.  Going forward, we expect widening output gaps to lower  
inflation to 1 ¼ percent in 2012 and 1 percent in  2013.   
At its November meeting, the ECB cut its benchmark policy rate 25 basis points  
t
o 1.25 percent and ECB  President Draghi acknowledged that a mild recession was likely.  
In light of the weaker outlook for output and inflation, we now expect that the ECB will  
further reduce its policy rate 25 basis points  at  its  December  8 meeting and substantially  
expand its liquidity support to banks, allowing the overnight interest  rate to fall to near  
zero in coming months. 
United Kingdom  
U.K. real GDP rose 2 percent in the third quarter, nearly ½ percentage point  faster  
than our October Tealbook estimate.  However, the expansion wa s due  entirely to a large 
positive contribution from the change in inventories; private consumption was flat  and 
investment spending declined.  Recen t indicators suggest that economic activity  
weakened in the current  quarter, with the  composite PMI falling to just above 50 and 
business and consumer sentiment plunging to near two-year lows.  Thus, we project that  
real GDP will expand at a meager ½  percent pace  in the fourth quarter, down 
½ percentage point from  the  October  Tealbook.  The deepening of the recession in the 
euro area is expected to  continue  weigh ing on the  GDP outlook, as almost half of U.K. 
exports go to the euro area.  Thus, U.K.  real GDP  should grow  only ¾ percent in 2012 
before picking up to a still-modest 1¾ percent pace in 2013.  These figures  are down 
nearly  1 percentage point  from  the previous Tealbook.   
Twelve-month headline inflation came in at  5 percent in October.  Moreover, on a 
quarterly basis, we estimate that inflation rose from 3 ½ percent in the third quarter to 
4¼ percent in the  fourth quarter, reflecting higher  utility prices and pass -through of past  
increases in energy prices  to core inflation .  Going forward, with domest ic energy prices

projected to decline, ample resource slack,  and assuming no further VAT increases, 
inflation should decline to below 2 percent over the remainder of the  forecast period.     
Faced with renewed financial stresses and a deteriorating outlook, we expect that  
the Bank of England will increase the size of its asset purchase program from  the  
£275 billion  announced in October to £400 billion (28 percent of GDP) during the first  
half of 2012, £75 billion more than we had anticipated  in the previous Tealbook.   
Japan  
Japanese real GDP jumped 6  percent in the third quarter  as it rebounded from the  
disruptions of the March earthquake and tsunami.  Recent data have been mixed, with 
merchandise  exports falling almost 5 percent in October but industrial production rising  
2½ percent.  Floods in Thailand have  created shortages of parts in Japan, especially in the  
automotive sector, although this effect should be small and temporary.  All  told, we  
expect GDP growth to  slow to 2 percent in the fourth quarter,  down a bit from the  
October Tealbook.  Going forward, economic  growth should stay around 2 percent in 
2012 and slow to 1½ percent in 2013, as the boost from post- quake reconstruction is 
expected to wane.  This projection is down ¼ percentage point from  that in  the  October  
Tealbook because of the  weaker  global outlook.   
Core consumer  prices declined in October  at a somewhat more rapid pace than  
previously  expected, prompting us to lower our forecast for fourth- quarter inflation to  
negative ½  percent.  We p roject deflation to moderate only slightly over the forecast  
period, amid still sizable  output gaps.  Given the  weaker outlook for both output and 
inflation, we now expect  the Bank of Japan to expand its asset purchase program from  
¥20 trillion to ¥25 trillion (5 percent of GDP) in early 2012.  
Canada  
Real GDP rose 3.5  percent in the third quarter, a  full percentage point more than 
anticipated in the October Tealbook, as oil production rebounded faster than expected  
after several months of shutdowns.  Howeve r,  third -quarter  consumption and investment  
spending  were relatively disappointing , and recent  indicators point to slowing g  rowth.  In  
October , the manufacturing PMI edged down and the unemployment rate increased to 
7.3 percent.  We now  expect fourth- quarter  GDP  to increase 2  percent,  ½ percentage 
point less than in the previous Tealbook.  Looking ahead, we anticipate that Canadian output will grow 2 percent in 2012 and in 2013.  The forecast for 2013 is nearly

½ percentage point lower than in the previous  Tealbook, largely reflecting  weaker  
projected  demand from the United States. 
Canadian consumer prices rose more in October than we expected, driven entirely  
by a large increase in  domestic  energy prices.  This  development has led us to revise up 
significan tly our  estimate  for headline inflation in the current quarter to 3¾ percent.  
Going forward, amid a somewhat weaker  growth outlook, we now anticipate that  
inflation will average 2  percent in 2012 and slow to about 1½ percent in 2013.  We 
expect that the B ank of Canada will keep its target for the overnight  rate unchanged  at  
1 percent  throughout the  forecast period instead of  raising it in 2013, as  we had  
previously assumed.  
EMERGING MARKET  ECONOMIES  
In the EMEs, aggregate real GDP  grew 4¾ percent in the th ird quarter, about as  
expected in the October  Tealbook, with weaker -than-anticipated  growth in emerging Asia  
offsetting stronger  growth in Mexico.   In the current quarter, we estimate that EME  
growth slow ed to 3¾ percent, ½ percentage point lower than in t he previous Tealbook.  
This  slowing  reflects  both the adverse effects of severe  flooding in Thailand, which 
disrupted economic activity in that country and supply chains throughout Asia , as well as  
weaker external demand  from Europe.  In 2012 and 2013, GDP  growth  in the EMEs  
should pick up to around 4½ percent,  a bit below its trend pace  and a little weaker than in  
the October Tealbook, as solid domestic demand supports growth, but  an anemic 
recovery in the United States and the recession in Europe continue to weigh on external  
demand .  
Headline consumer price inflation, after  increasing  in the third quarter, is  
projected to fall in the fourth to a touch less than 4 percent  at an annual rate—not quite as  
sharp a fall as anticipated at the time of the October  Tealbook.  We project inflation will  
continue to edge lower to 3½ percent in the  first quarter of next  year, as the effects of  
previous food and energy price increases  fade.  Inflation should remain around 
3¼ percent thereafter.  The moderation of inflation in recent months, along with greater  
uncertainty about  global  economic prospects, has  prompted many  central banks to refrain 
from tightening monetary  policy further and some, including those in China and Brazil , 
to loosen policy.

China  
Chinese data indic ate that , on balance, economic activity is decelerating  amid  
weakening global growth .  The November manufacturing  PMI fell to  49, although for 
China and many  other  EMEs , a level of 50 has historically indicated still- significant  
growth as opposed to a  contraction.  Indicators of  domestic  demand  have remained  
strong.  In October, fixed- asset investment and industrial production growth  were  steady.   
Real retail sales decelerated slightly but  remained  10 percent higher than a  year earlier.  
In  contrast, extern al demand has been weak, with seasonally adjusted exports in October  
at  the lowe st  level since February.  We project that Chinese real GDP  growth will slow  to 
8¼ percent in the  fourth quarter from 9½ percent  in the third, reflecting weaker demand  
from the  advanced economies  and the effect of the Thai floods.  With the former  
expected to continue, our projection of Chinese  growth in 2012 and 2013—roughly  
8 percent throughout—has  been revised  down ¼ percentage point.   
Chinese headline consumer price inflation peaked in the third quarter at  an annual  
rate of 6¼  percent, reflecting very high inflation in June and July.  Since August, 
however, inflation has been much more muted, and we  estimate that inflation in the  
fourth quarter will  come in at  3½ percent.  As  food price pressures continue to wane  and 
Chinese econom ic growth  slows from this  year’s  pace, inflation should average  a little  
less than 3  percent over the next two years.  
With inflation moderating and growth slowing, the  PBOC  reversed course on  
monetar y policy and lowered the  reserve requirement ratio for banks 50 basis points in 
late November, bringing  the ratio to 21 percent for large banks.  The PBOC had been on 
hold since late August, when it broadened the range of deposits  subject to reserve 
requir ements .   
Other Emerging Asia  
Since the October  Tealbook, we have received third -quarter GDP for all of the  
other emerging Asian  economies.  Aggregate real GDP  growth  for these economies  
slowed to 2½ percent, hampered by weaker- than-expected external deman d; this rate is  
1¾ percentage points lower than the projection in the previous Tealbook.  In the  current  
quarter, we have lowered our estimate for  growth  1¼ percentage points to 2¼ percent , 
reflecting a   nearly 14 percent contraction in Thailand, the temporary disruption of  
regional supply  chains, and weaker demand from  Europe.  Growth should pick up to 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook

nearly  4½ percent  during the next two  years , a bit lower than in the October Tealbook 
owing to greater drag from the advanced economies.   
Inflation in the r egion is  expected to remain around  3½ percent in the  current  
quarter , with  falling inflation in some countries, including Korea, offset by  increases in 
Hong Kong a  nd Thailand.  We expect inflation to edge down to about 3¼ percent over  
the remainder of the forecast period.  Since the previous Tealbook, growth concerns have  
prompted Indonesia’s  central bank to lower its policy rate 50 basis points and Thailand’s  
central bank to cut its policy rate 25 basis points.  
Latin America  
Mexican real GDP  surged  5½ percent in the third quarter—1½ percentage  points  
faster  than estimated in the October  Tealbook—driven by soaring output in the volatile  
agricultural sector.  Services also grew robustly, but manufacturing g  rowth was weak.  
GDP is expected to decelerate to abo ut  a 3 percent pace in the  current quarter, held down 
in part by slow  growth in U.S. manufacturing  activity .  We expect that  real GDP will  
continue to grow at a 3 percent pace in 2012 and 2013.  This  projection is down 
¼ percentage point from  that in the October Tealbook, in line with revisions to U.S. 
manufacturing production. 
We estimate  that real GDP in South America moderated to a 2½ percent pace in 
the third quarter .   Brazilian real GDP was flat , down about 2½ percentage points  relative 
to the October Tealbook.  For the  current quarter, i ndicators of Brazilian activity  show  
modest improvement, and we  expect growth  of 2¼ percent,  still well  below trend.  Our  
forecast calls for  Brazilian GDP growth to gradually increase to 3¾ percent, our estimate  
of potential, by the  end of 2013.  Relative to the October Tealbook, this projection  is 
down about ¼ percentage point over the forecast period, reflecting the weaker  global  
environment. 
We have  headline  consumer price inflation in  Latin America climbing  to 
4¾ percent in the current quarter, led by increases  in Mexico, where electricity subsidies  
expired and the peso has  been depreciating  in recent months, and in Brazil, whe re  the 
real has also been trending downward.  Looking a  head, we expect inflation in Latin 
America to moderate to 3¾ percent by the end of next  year  and  hold at that  pace in 2013.  
In response to the deteriorating outlook for  global growth, the Brazilian central  
bank lowered its policy rate 50 basis points on November 30, bringing the  cumulative

loosening since this summer to 150 basis points.  The monetary policy  committee said  
that these reductions are  consistent with inflation falling to within its target range   
(2.5 to 6.5 percent)  by the end of 2012.

Financial Developments  
The crisis in Europe remained the focus of  financial markets  over the intermeeting  
period and contributed to  heightened  volatility  in a wide range of asset  market s.  Early in 
the period, investors became increasingly  concerned  that E uropean leaders  would fail to  
agree on actions forceful  enough to successfully address the mounting problems in the  
euro  area.  However, those co ncerns  eased later in the period  amid s igns  that European 
leaders  and the ECB might finally take decisive and effective steps to address the crisis  
and  after  the Federal Reserve and  five other major central banks  announced  that  they 
would lower the cost of dollar funds offered through their  swap  line arrangements .  
Somewhat better -than-expected readings on domestic  economic activity  also appeared to  
support  market sentiment .  
Over the intermeeting period, Treasury y  ields fluctuated within a  relatively  
narrow range and  were slightly higher  on net.  Inflation compensation and the  expected  
path of the federal  funds rat e were  also  little changed  on balance.  By contrast, yields  on 
investment-grade  corporate bonds  rose somewhat  over the period, leaving t  heir spreads to 
comparable Treasury  yields wider.   U.S. banks continued to have fairly normal  access to  
short-term fundi ng markets .  Broad indexes  of U.S. equity prices  fluctuated widely  and 
increased  a bit  on net.  The dollar strengthened  slightly  on balance over the period, 
though it  depreciat ed significantly  following the swap line announcement.  
Net debt financing of  nonfinancial firms  picked up in November  from  an already  
solid pace in October.  Nonfinancial corporate bond issuance was particularly robust, as  
some firms were reportedly eager to issue bonds  before  year-end.  N onfinancial  
commercial  paper outstanding and C&I loans continued to expand at a moderate pace.    
In the household sector,  consumer credit rose slightly in the  third  quarter, while  mortgage  
refinancing activit y  remained subdued amid tight  underwriting standards  and low levels  
of home equity.  Bank credi t continued to expand briskly over the intermeeting period, 
and banks reported moderately  higher earnings in the  third  quarter .  M2 growth  also  
remained solid in the autumn.    
POLICY  EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY  YIELDS  
Treasury y ields were little changed following the release of the November  FOMC  
statement  and fluctuated in a  fairly  narrow range o  ver subsequent  weeks , ending the

period slightly higher on net.  Yields were supported by generally stronger -than-expected  
news  on U.S. economic  activity but  were bu ffeted by  swings in  investor  sentiment 
regarding the European crisis.  The widely anticipated  failure of the Joint Select 
Committee on Deficit Reduction  to reach  an agreement  did not  appear to  elicit a 
sustained response in financial  market s.  Similarly,  markets largely shrugged off the  
Fitch  Ratings  announcement  of its  bleaker  outlook for the U.S. sovereign credit  rating.  
Consistent with relatively  low realized volatility,  the  implied volatility of  long- term 
Treasury  yields  declined  noticeably near the en d of the intermeeting period.  
Aside from the swap line announcement, FOMC communications during the  
inter
meeting period were generally in line with expectations and  prompted little market 
reaction.  M arket participants  reportedly did ta ke note of  the Chair man’s remarks  during  
the post- FOMC -meeting  press conference  that expanded mortgage -backed securities  
(MBS )  purchases constitute d a “viable option” under appropriate conditions.  Market  
participants also reportedly noted the discussion in the minutes regarding the  FOMC’s 
intention to improve policy  communications, but there were  no  apparent effect s in 
markets.   
The mean path of the expected federal funds rate was  about  unchanged over the 
period, and the expected  federal  funds rate continued to lie  within  the  current target range 
until the fourth quarter of 2013.1   The modal path of the federal funds  rate derived from  
quotes on interest rate  caps shifted up a bit but  remains within  the target range into  the 
middle of 2015.  
Results from the  Open Market  Desk’s latest survey  of primary dealers also  
suggested that the expected path of the policy rate  was little changed.  Respondents  
continued to view the second quarter of 2014 as the most likely time for liftoff of the  
federal funds rate.2   Most respondents did not anticipate major changes in the language  
of the statement at the upcoming F  OMC meeting.  In response to questions  about  
possible options  for easing, dealers revised  from 50 percent to 80 percent the likelihood 
they  assigned to the Committee making change s within one  year to its forward guidance  
regarding the  federal funds rate.   In addition, participants revised from 50 percent  to  
60 percent the likelihood they  assigned  to an  expansion of  the SOMA portfolio through

one  year there is a 75 percent chance  that the Committee will provide more information 
on its  policy objectives (such as  its  longer-run inflation goal)  and a 75 percent chance that  
the Committee will provide more information about  its  assessment of appropriate 
monetary policy in the Summary of Economic Projections.  Dealers upgraded notably  
their forecasts for  real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2011, while their growth 
forecasts for 2012 and 2013 w ere little  changed.  Respondents’ median forecasts for  core  
PCE inflation declined a little for 2011 and 2013 but increased a touch for 2012, while  
their estimates of headline PCE inflation for 2011 through 2013 declined slightly.  
The D esk’s o utr ight purchases  and sales  of Treasury securities  continued to be  
well received , and the operations did not appear to have any  adverse ef  fects on Treasury  
market functioning.3   Indeed , measures of liquidity  in nominal Treasury and TIPS  
markets  changed little over the intermeeting period . 
SHORT -TERM  FUNDING  MARKETS  
Over the intermeeting period, U.S. financial  institutions  were general ly  able to  
access  short-term funding  markets  on relatively normal  terms.  For  example,  spreads on 
unsecured financial commercial  paper , as well  as  haircuts and rates in the repurchase 
agreement (repo )  market , remained at  relatively low levels .  That said, U.S. firms i n the  
Libor panel  reported  somewhat elevated spreads over OIS rates .  
In  contrast, European institutions  have faced increased  strain s in such markets , 
especially for dollar funding (see the box “U.S. Dollar Funding Pressures and Dollar  
Liquidity Swap Arrangements ”).  In early November, the spread between the three -month 
forward rate agreement (FRA) and the OIS rate three to six months ahead increased  
sharply, and the cost of dollar funding implied  by FX basis swaps also spike d.  However,  
conditions improved following the  announcement on November 30 by the Federal  
Reserve and other major  central banks  that they would reduce the  cost of e xisting dollar  
liquidity swap  arrangements  by 50 basis points (to the OIS  rate plus 50 basis points) and 
that they would extend the swap arrangements until February 1, 2013.4   Strains were also  
eased by hopes that European leaders might finally  take decisive and effective steps  to

$100 billion of long -term securities under the maturity extension program .

arrangements to allow provision of liquidity in each jurisdiction in any of their currencies if needed.

U.S.  Dollar  Funding  Pressures  and   
Dollar  Liquidity  Swap  Arrangements   
As  the  euro‐area  crisis  has  intensified,   the  dollar  funding  pressures   faced  by  euro‐area  financial  
institutions   have  increased.    Many  institutions   have  found  it  increasingly   difficult  to  obtain  
unsecured   dollar  funding,  particularly   at  maturities   exceeding   one  week.    
A  number  of  euro‐area  financial  institutions   have  instead  obtained   dollar  funding  by  borrowing   
euros  and  swapping   them  into  dollars   via  the  private  foreign  exchange  (FX)  swap  market,   but  
the  cost  of  such  funding  has  also  increased.    The  impli ed  cost  of  dollar  funding  (the  black  line  in  
the  figure  on  the  facing  page),  under  the  assumption   that  euros  are  borrowed   at  euro  Libor  and  
swapped   into  dollars,  rose  from  40  basis  points  early  this  summer  to  about  200  basis  points  by  
late  November.   The  large  increase  in  dollar  funding  costs  through   the  FX  swap  market  is  likely   
due  to  both   heightened   demand  for  dollar  funds  relative  to  euros  in  that  market  and  fears   
about  the  solvency   of  European  financial  institutions.    Although  FX  swap   transactions   are  by  
nature  collateralized,  market  participants  may  fear  that,  if  the  euro‐area  crisis  were  to  worsen,  
the  value  of  the  euros   held  as  collateral  could  drop  sharply  at  the  same  time  as  some  of  their  
European  counterparties   were  unable  to  return  their  dollars.   
In  May  2010,  the  ECB  resumed  providing  dollar  loans  against  eligible  collateral,  using  funds  
obtained   through  its  swap  line  with  the  Federal  Reserve.   It  offered  these  loans  at  a  cost  of  
100  basis  points  plus  the  overnight  index  swap  (OIS)  rate  at  the  relevant  maturity.   As  shown  by  
the  red  line  in  the  figure  on  the  facing  page,  at  the  three‐month  maturity  the  cost  of  dollar  
funding  at  the  ECB  has  been  below  the  cost  of  dollar  funding  through  the  FX  swap  market  since  
late  summer,  and  a  significant  wedge  between  the  two  series  developed  in  November.1   Despite  
the  favorable   cost  differential,   demand  at  the  ECB’s  October  and  November   tenders  was  
extremely   small;  the  outstanding   amount  of  loans  totaled  only  $2.3  billion  at  the  end  of  
November.    
Three  potential   explanations   may  account  for  the  low  demand:   the  high  level  of  collateral   
haircuts  imposed  by  the  ECB,  the  ability  of  some  European   banks  to  access  low‐cost  euro  
funding,  and  the  poten tial  stigma  associated   with  borrowing   dollars  from  the  ECB.    
Regarding   haircuts,  in  addition  to  the  standard  levels  imposed  on  various  types  of  collateral,   to  
account  for  exchange  rate  risk,  the  ECB  has  required  an  additional   haircut  of  12  percent  at  a  one‐
week  maturity  and,  prior  to  December  7,  20  percent  at  a  three‐month  maturity.    The  extra  
collateral   required  likely  imposed  an  additional   cost  for  borrowing   dollars  from  the  ECB  in  the  
range  of  10  to  20  basis  points.   
The  second  possible  reason  for  low  demand  is  that  many  European  institutions  can  borrow  
euros  at  a  rate  below  euro  Libor,  lowering  the  implicit  cost  of  dollars  borrowed   through  FX  
1 The cost of one week dollar funding in the FX swap market, not shown, has remained below the cost of 
one week dollar funding from the ECB.

swaps  and  making  the  ECB  facility  less  attractive  by  comparison.    For  instance,   in  mid‐
November,  European   institutions   could  obtain   euro  liquidity  from  the  ECB  for  three  months  at  
125  basis  points,  about  15  basis  points  less  than  in  the  comparable‐maturity   euro  Libor  market,  
reducing  the  cost  of  dollar  borrowing   by  that  amoun t.   In  the  extreme,   institutions   with   
unencumbered   German   or  French  general  collateral   could  borrow  euros  through  repurchase  
agreements   for  about  30  basis  points,  lowering  the  final  cost  of  dollar  borrowing   via  an  FX  swap  
more  than   100  basis   points,  to  a  level  below  that  offered  by  the  ECB.  
Finally,  even  healthy  European  financial  institutions   may  fear   that  stigma  would  be  associated   
with  borrowing   from  the  ECB.   That  is,  they  may  be  concerned   that  borrowing   from  the  ECB  
might  by  viewed  by  creditors   and  counterparties   as  evidence  of  financial  weakness.   Although  
the  ECB  does  not  publish  the  names  of  participating   institutions,   some  banks  in  the  past  
announc ed  that  they  had  not  participated,   reportedly   leading  to  speculation  about  those  who  
may  have.   Moreover,   some  market  participants   believe  they  can  infer  participation   by  
monitoring   a  bank’s  trading  activity  (for  example,   the  institution   may  suddenly   stop  borrowing  
in  the  FX  swap  market).    
To  ease  the  growing  strains  in  dollar  funding  and  to  lower  any  hurdles  financial  institutions   
might  confront  in  taking  advantage  of  dollar  liquidity   offered  by  foreign  central  banks,  the  
Federal  Reserve  and  the  ECB,  along  with  four  other  central   banks,  agreed  on  November   30  to  
lower  the  pricing  of  dollar  liquidity  to  a  rate   of  50  basis  points  over  the  relevant‐ maturity  OIS  
rate.   In  addition,   the  ECB  lowered  its  additional   collateral   requirement  for  three‐ month  U.S.  
dollar   operations   to  12  percent.    The  cost  of  dollar  funding  through  private  FX  swap  markets  
dropped  about  40  basis  points  over  the  subsequent   two  days.   On  December   7,  at  the  first  
dollar   tender  under  the  new  pricing  scheme,  the  ECB  allocated   $50.7  billion  in  three‐ month  
funding  to  34  institutions,   a  substantial   increase  over  previous  operations.2  
2 The ECB also lent $1.6 billion in one week funds to five institutions.

address the crisis  in the euro area.  In an apparent  response to these developments, the  
FRA –OIS forward spread and the cost of dollar  funding implied by  FX basis swaps both 
retraced large part s  of their earlier increases.   On Dec ember 7, the ECB allocated   
$50.7 billion in three-month dollar funding to 34 institutions at its first tender under the  
new pricing, a substantial increase over previous auctions, and implied basis fell a bit  
further.   That said, the three- month Libor –OIS  spread continued to increase through the  
end of the intermeeting period, although apparently  very little, if any, activity is occurring  
at those maturities . 
In addition, unsecured  fin ancial commercial paper issued by  entities with  
European ( especially Fren ch)  parents  continued to run off, as did AA- rated asset -backed  
commercial paper  from programs with European sponsors.  Average ma turities for 
European issuers have stayed well below  those  for domestic issuers , as investors  such as  
money market funds have apparently  remained  reluctant to acquire all but the shortest  
exposures to European firms. 
FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS  
On balance o ver the intermeeting period, equity prices of large domestic financial  
institutions  increased  a bit, and CDS spreads for most  large domestic bank holding  
companies  (BHCs)  were about unchanged.  Within the period, both equity  prices and 
CDS spreads were buffeted by developments in Europe.  In addition, Standard  & Poor’s  
(S&P) downgraded the  credit rating s  of a large  number  of global  financial firms , 
including the six largest U.S. BHCs , as part of their implementation of new methods that 
were announced earlier in the year.  The downgrades  were generally not large an  d  
appeared to elicit  relatively little market response .    
Responses to the December 2011 Senior Credit Officer  Opinion Survey on Dealer  
Financing Terms indicated a broad but moderate tightening of  credit terms  over the past  
three months (s ee the appendix  on the survey at the end of this section).  Dealers  
generally tightened  terms applicable to important classes of counterparties across a range 
of transactions, as  well as those applicable when financing important types  of collateral.  
In addition, notable net shares of  respondents reported that liquidity  and functioning had 
deteriorated in a range of financial markets other than those for Treasur y securities  and 
U.S. equities.  The vast  majority of dealers indicated both that the amount of time and 
attention devoted to the  management of  concentrated credit exposures to other dealers  
had increased and, in response to a special question on the survey, that they decreased

credit limits for some specific financial institutions.  Th ese changes  may well reflect 
continuing concerns  about the potential effects of events in Europe on fi nancial  
institutions, as well as concerns about smaller broker–dealers in the wake of the failure of  
MF Global and funding  pressure s  on Jefferies  Group .  
On November 22, the  Federal Reserve announced  the details of the  supervisory  
stress test  that  will be  completed in March; market reaction was  generally  muted .  On the  
same day,  press reports indicated that Bank of America was  instructed by  regulators to 
strengthen its capital position to avoid facing a   public enforcement action.   
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Devel opments in international financial markets  remained  centered on the  
situation in Europe, which continued to be highly  volatile .  The positive  sentiment that 
followed the October summit of  euro -area leaders  quickly  gave way to pessimism amid  
political turmoil in Greece and  Italy and  a  growing realization that attempts to  provide an 
effective firewall by  leverag ing  the funds available to the European Financial Stability  
Facility (EFSF)  would be insufficient.  Despite stepped -up purchases of sovereign debt  
by the ECB, 10-year peripheral  government bond spreads over German bonds rose for  
most of the period.  Spreads on core European government bonds also increased.  
German sovereign yields rose, briefly surpassing r  ates on U.K. gilts despite a much  
higher  rate o f inflation in the United Kingdom, and the EFSF was forced to temporarily  
postpone a new debt issue as market  conditions worsened.  However, late in the period , in 
the lead -up to the December 9 European summit, investors’  fears  eased somewhat on  
hopes  that  euro -area leaders might agree to  a set of  tighter  fiscal rules  for the euro area 
and that the ECB might agree to take  further actions in response.  As a result,  yield  
spreads over German bonds declined substantially  for most European economies .  That  
said, spreads for the most vulnerable euro-area countries, including Greece  and Portugal, 
increased over the intermeeting period , and last  week,  S&P placed 15 euro- area countries  
and the EFSF on review  for potential downgrade.  
Several European banks  announced large declines in third -quarter profits owing to 
write -downs on holdings of Greek sovereign debt.  Notably, Italy’s largest bank, 
UniCredit, announced a surprise €10.5 billion third -quarter loss  and reportedly  asked the 
ECB to expand the range of collateral  it accepts  at its lending facilities.   Amid rising  
spreads on Italian sovereign debt, LCH.Clearnet , the main European clearinghouse  for  
the repo market,  raised margins on repos involving Italian  government securities .

Maturities  shortened notably  for repos  using the sovereign bonds of most euro- area 
countries as collateral.  However,  repos using  German  bonds showed little change in 
maturity , and their rates  declined sharply  as investors appeared to s hift activity to safe r 
assets.  
Investors shied away from risky assets for most of the period, although they  
rev
ersed course late in the  period as sentiment improved.  Equity prices in both 
developed and emerging m  arkets followed this pattern and ended the period little  
changed on net.  F light-to-safety flows boosted the dollar  by over 2 percent  against the 
euro, on ne t, over the intermeeting period  despite  the dollar’s sharp depreciation 
following t he swap line announcement.  The dollar rose less, on balance, against most 
other currencies, leaving t  he broad nominal index of the dollar only slightly higher than 
at the time of the November FOMC meeting.   Following a downward trend in the peso in 
recent  months, Mexico’s government announced that it would resume its program of  
dollar sales on days when the peso depreciates more than 2 percent  against the dollar.  In  
Brazil , whose currency has also been depreciating on balance  since last summer , 
authoritie s took measures to exempt foreign investors in equities and longer- term 
corporate bonds from  taxes on financial transactions.       
Citing  the implications of  a weakening  growth outlook for  price pressures , the  
ECB cut its  benchmark policy rate  by 25 basis points to 1¼ percent  in November.  
Several o ther  central banks also eased over the period.  The People’ s Bank of China  
lowered its reserve  requirement by 50 basis points—its first such cut in nearly three  
years —and Brazil’s central bank cut its  benchmark rate by 50 basis points  in late  
November on concerns that external demand would weaken further.  As a precautionary  
measure, the  Bank of England announced a new liquidity  facility, the Extended Collateral  
Term Repo Facility, which will auction term sterling  funds against a wide  range of  
collateral.    
Demand for  U.S. Treasury securities  by private  foreign investors  remained solid 
in October.  By contrast, official holdings of Treasur y securit ies fell in October , as large 
acquisitions from earlier  currency interventions  ran down.  However, more recent data on  
official holdings under custody  at  the Federal  Reserve Bank  of New York  suggest a 
return to strong inflows in November, likely reflecting  the renewed  intervention by Japan 
at the end of October  and in earl y November to counter upward pressure on  the yen.

DOMESTIC  ASSET MARKET  DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad U.S. equity  price i  ndexes  were volatile over the intermeeting period  but  
increased  about 3 percent on net.  Consistent with  the large swings in stock  prices,  
option-implied volatility  on the S&P 500 index remained somewhat  elevated.   
Meanwhile, the staff’s estimate of the spread between the expected  real  equity return  for  
the S&P 500 index and the real 10- year Treasury yield —a gauge of the equity  
premium—remained extr aordinarily wide.  
Nearly all firms in the S&P 500 index have reported operating earnings for the  
third quarter.  Although earnings per share  grew 8 percent  relative to the previous quarter, 
the overall level of earnings in the second quarter was depressed by a  large loss at Bank 
of America .  Excluding this effect, corporate earnings  grew 3 percent in the third quarter.  
Yields  on BBB -rated  corporate bonds  rose  somewhat , on balance, over the  
intermeeting period, and their spreads to yields  on  comparable -matu rity Treasury 
securities  widened 25 basis points;  yields and spreads for  speculative- grade co  rporate 
bonds  were about unchanged .  The spread of  yields on 30-day A2/P2- rated unsecured  
commercial paper issued by nonfinancial firms over  yields on A1/P1- rated  issues 
increased  a bit, on net, over  the intermeeting period , possibly  reflecting some moderate 
year-end pressures in that market.   
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Net debt financing of nonfinancial firms  increased  in November  from an already  
solid pace in October.  I nvestment - and speculative- grade issuance of nonfinancial  
corporate bonds was particularly  robust in November, as some firms were reportedly  
eager to issue bonds before year -end.  Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding a  nd 
C&I loans expanded at  a moderate p  ace.  Issuance of leveraged loans stepped up 
somewhat in October but remained sluggish relative to the  pace seen  earlier this  year.    
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms rebounded in November after  
a slow third quarter, as some previously  withdrawn IPOs were  reportedly brought back to 
the market.  However, net equity issuance became  more negative in the third quarter, 
reflecting the  continued strength of cash- financed  mergers and share repurchases.   
Preliminary data on merger activity  and announcements of new share- repurchase 
programs suggest continued sizable equity retirements in the fourth quarter.

Indicators of the  credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained solid.   
Based on preliminary data, the aggregate ratio of debt to asset s stayed low in the third 
quarter, and the  aggregate  liquid  asset ratio remained near its highest level  in more than  
20 years.  Upgrades by  Moody’s  Investors Service of corporate bonds issued by  
nonfinancial companies slightly outpaced downgrades in October  and November.  
Furthermore, the six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial firms remained 
close to zero  in October, and the expected  year-ahead default rate for such  firms ticked  
down a bit in November.  
Data received during the intermeeting period suggest that commercial real  est ate 
markets remained  depressed and financing  conditions for such property continued to be  
strained.  Delinquency rates on commercial  mortgages  remained  high , and prices of  
commercial real estate have been flat at depressed  levels.   In addition, vacancy  rates for  
most types of commercial properties  have stayed  elevated , exerting f  urther  downward 
pressure on property  prices and the performance of commercial mortgage loans.  W hile a 
small volume of commercial mortgage -backed securities ( CMBS ) issuance  continued to 
trickle  through the pipeline, liquidity  conditions in the  CMBS  market have  reportedly  
deteriorated in recent m onths, partly owing to increased volatility  related to the situation  
in Europe.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Inter est rates on residential mortgages  were little changed, on net, over the  
intermeeting period.  Rates on conforming mortgages  fluctuated within a narrow  range 
near the historically low level of 4 percent for 30- year  fixed -rate l oans, largely tracking  
the mo vements of  yields on agency MBS.  The Desk continued to reinvest receipts of  
principal payments from  SOMA holdings  of agency securities in  MBS.   Market reactions  
to the announcements by  Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac on November 15 regarding the  
details of an  expansion of the Home Affordable Refinance Program appeared to be quite  
limited and were contained within the high -coupon MBS  segment, where yields declined  
slightly as investor concerns about an i ncrease in refinancing -related prepayments  eased .  
In gener al,  mortgage  refinancing activity remained subdued, as tight underwriting  
standards and low home  equity continued to limit access of many households to the  
mortgage market.  
Mortgage credit quality  appears to have improved a bit  further  recently, as the 
three-month moving a  verage of the  entry rate into delinquency for  prime mortgages

returned to a downward trend after having moved sideways for several months.  That  
said, overall  delinquency rates  on residential mortgages remained elevated.   Moreover, 
house prices continued to decline, with the CoreLogic index edging lower in both 
September  and October.   
In contrast to the glo omy conditions in the market for home  mortgages,  consumer  
credit markets  have shown some signs of improvement.  In addition, consumer c redit rose 
slightly in the third quarter.  The a ggregate volume of  credit  card  solicitation s  in recent  
months  has remained at  levels  comparable to those seen before the escalation of the 
financial crisis in 2008, though the mail volume for low-income households  is still well 
below pre- crisis levels.   Issuance of  consumer ABS increased substantially  in November.  
Meanwhile, consumer credit quality improved further in recent months, with delinquency  
rates on credit card loans declining to near historical lows and delinquency  rates on 
nonrevolving c  onsumer credit at commercial banks retreating to pre- crisis level s.  
GOVERNMENT  FINANCE  
During the intermeeting  period, the Treasury auctioned  about $171 billion of  
nominal coupon securities across the maturity spectrum and $11 billion of 10- year TIPS.   
The auctions were generally well received, with the exception s of the 10-  and 30- year  
auctions in early November, which saw  slightly below -average shares of  indirect bidding  
and lower- than-expected pricing amid  heightened  market volatility.    
For state  and local  governments, financing conditions were somewhat mixed.  
Gross long-term issuance of municipal bonds remained robust in November, with a  
modest pickup in new capital issuance.  However, in the third quarter, Mood y’s again  
downgraded substantially  more municipal bonds than it upgraded, a trend that   
higher- frequency data suggest will  persist in the fourth quarter.  Yields on long- term 
general obligation (GO)  municipal bonds were  about flat, on net, and  the ratio of   
GO-bond yields to yields on comparable- maturity  Treasury securities —a gauge of the 
relative risk of municipal bonds—fluctuated at elevated levels .   
COMMERCIAL  BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit  grew briskly  in October and November, boosted by  growth in both 
loans and  securities.   Increases  in C&I loans remained widespread among domestic banks  
amid reports of strong appetite for better -quality syndicated credits, while  growth of C&I

loans at branches and agencies of foreign banks stalled.  However, commercial real  estate 
loans declined further  on balance.   Closed -end residential mortgage loans on banks’  
books increased rapidly in October and  early November , which was  due in part to the 
settlement of loans from last summer’s  pick up in refinanc ing activity.  By contrast, home  
equity loans continued to run off.   Credit  card loans remained about flat , and other  
consumer loans rose.   
Noncore loans  ra mped up further at large  domestic banks and at branches and  
agencies of foreign banks  in October and November, apparently in part  because of the 
extremely tight short -term funding conditions in Europe.  Indeed, w eekly  data combined  
with  information from the third -quarter Call Report suggest  that reverse repos  and other  
loans from U.S. banks to foreign banks  and to nonbank financial institutions  in the United 
States and abroad have  contributed importantly to the recent strength in noncore loans.  
Aggregate profitability o f BHCs  increased moderately in the third quarter  of  
2011, primarily  because of  accounting gains  related t o drops in the market  value of bank 
debt and reductions in noninterest expense  at the largest BHCs .  Net interest income  
continued to decline, reportedly owing to a  runoff of higher- yielding assets .  For the  
industry as  a whole, net income continued to be supported by the  release of  loan loss  
reserves, albeit to  a lesser extent than in previous quarters.  Delinquency and charge- off 
rates continued to improve across most major asset classes.   Overall, regulatory  capital  
ratios were about unchanged  and remain ed near the high end of their historical ranges. 
The leverage ratio s of the largest BHCs decreased a bit further in the third quarter, partly  
owing to balance sheet expansion related to the ongoing rapid growth in deposits. 
The November Survey of Terms of  Business  Lending showed that spreads  of rates  
on C&I loans over banks’ cost of funds were little changed since the August s urvey and 
remained  elevated.  Although spreads at domestic banks inched up because of  changes in  
loan composition, this  increase was  offset i n part by  a decrease in spread s  at U.S. 
branches  and agencies of foreign banks.  Reflecting the intensification of the  European 
crisis  last month , however, spreads on C&I loans originated by  European banks increased 
sharply in the November survey , and  the share of  originations  by those institutions  
relative to the total at all  foreign banks fell for the  third consecutive quarter.  
M2 expanded at a 4¾ percent annual rate in November amid ongoing   
flight- to-quality flows related to the European crisis.  Liquid deposits, the single largest  
component of M2, accelerated to an annual  growth rate of 9  percent, partly  because of

continued rebooking of offshore deposits to domestic  offices .  Offshore deposits have  
been included in the FDIC’s assessment base s ince April of this  year, negating some of  
the benefits to banks of booking these deposits abroad, and the  FDIC’ s insurance of  
onshore deposits makes them increasingly attractive when uncertainty rises.  Currency  
grew at an  annual rate of  8¼ percent in November, above its his torical average,  reflecting  
strong domestic and international demand.  The monetary base—reserve balances and  
currency —fell at  an annual rate of  18½ percent, in line with a  temporary  decline in the  
size of the SOMA portfolio (s ee the box  “Balance Sheet Developments over the 
Intermeeting Period”).

Balance  Sheet  Developments   over  the  Intermeeting  Period  
Over  the  intermeeting   period,   total  assets  of  the  Federal  Reserve  edged  down  
$21  billion  to  $2,812  billion  (see  the  table  on  the  facing  page).   
Since   the  November   FOMC  meeting,   the  Open   Market  Desk  at  the  Federal  
Reserve  Bank  of  New   York  (FRBNY)  has  conducted   22  operations   as  part  of  the  
maturity  extension   program:   The  Desk  purchased   $57  billion  in  Treasury  
securities   with  remaining   maturities   of  6  to  30  years   and  sold  $36  billion   in  
Treasury  securities   with  maturities   of  3  years   or  less.1   In  addition,  the  Desk  
purchased   $29  billion   in  agency  MBS  securities   as  part  of  the  policy  of  reinvesting   
principal  payments   from  agency  debt  and  agency  MBS.   Because  of  agency  MBS  
market  conventions,   settlements   of  these  transactions   can  occur  well  after  trade  
execution.    As  of  November  21,  the  FRBNY  required  primary  dealers  to  post  
margin  to  protect  the  FRBNY  against  counterparty   risk  associated   with  the  
forward   settlement  of  agency  MBS  transactions.    These  transactions   are  exposed   
to  market  value  changes  between  purchase  and  settlement.    In  addition,  to  
facilitate   December   and  January  settlements,   the  Desk  began  to  transact  dollar  
rolls  in  early  December.    
The  net  portf olio  holdings  of  Maiden  Lane   LLC  declined  $2  billion,  while  holdings  
of  the  Maiden  Lane   II  and  Maiden  Lane   III  LLCs  were  nearly  unchanged.   Loans  
outstanding   under  the  Term  Asset‐Backed   Securities   Loan  Facility  declined  about  
$1  billion   to  $10  billion.   Foreign  central  bank  liquidity  swaps  increased   a  bit  to  
$2  billion,  reflecting   several  small  draws  by  the  European   Central   Bank  and  the  
Bank  of  Japan.   On  November  30,  these  swap  lines  were  expanded   to  a  broader  
set  of  central  banks,  the  pricing  on  the  swap  lines  was  reduced,  and  swap  lines  in  
other  currencies   were  established.    The  authorization   of  the  swap  lines  was  
extended   through   February   1,  2013.2   
On  the  liability  side
  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s  balance  sheet,  Federal  Reserve  notes  
in  circulation   increased   $13  billion  over  the  period,  the  Treasury’s   General  Account  
decreased   $34  billion,  and  reverse  repurchase   transactions   with  foreign  official  
and  international   accounts   expanded   $4  billion.   The  Federal  Reserve  conducted   
an  additional   $5  billion  small‐ scale  operation  of  the  Term  Deposit  Facility.   
Reserve  balances,   deposits  of  depository   institutions,   declined  $30  billion  over  
the  period.   Other  deposits  increased   $17  billion,  primar ily  due  to  increases   in  GSE  
balances  reflecting   reduced  lending  in  the  federal  funds  market.  
1 Purchases of $9 billion conducted on December 5, 2011, and December 6, 2011, are not 
reflected in the table, as settlement occurred after December 5, 2011. 
2 The ECB subsequently drew $52 billion on the swap lines, including $1.6 billion maturing 
in 7 days and $50.7 billion maturing in 84 days. These transactions settle on December 8, 2011, 
and so are not reflected in the table.

Appendix  
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms  
Responses to  the December  2011 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer  
Financing Terms  indicate d a broad but moderate tightening of  credit terms  applicable to  
important classes of counterparties  over the past three months .1   This t ightening was  especially  
evident for hedge fund clients, trading  real  estate investment trusts  (REITs ), and nonfinancial  
corporations.2   Of note, respondents reported an increase  in the degree to which  more -favorable 
terms were offered to most -favored clients across  most  client  types .  An overwhelming majority  
of  firms  reported an increase in the  amount of  resources and attention devoted to the management  
of concentrated exposures to d ealers and other financial  intermediaries, as well as to  central  
counterparties and other  financial utilities, over the past three months.  These responses reflect an  
apparent continuation and intensification of developments already in evidence in the  Sept ember  
survey.   With respect  to a special question on aggregate counterparty credit limits to other  
financial institutions,  80 percent of dealers reported hav ing  decreased  limits for some specific 
counterparties.   
With regard to  over -the-counter (OTC)  derivatives, respondents to the December survey  
indicated  that nonprice terms incorporated in new or renegotiated OTC derivatives master  
agreements were for the most part  little changed , on net, during the past  three months.  However,  
a small net fraction  of respondents reported that  they had imposed more -stringent requirements , 
timelines, and thresholds for posting additional margin. 3   A small net fraction of dealers also  
reported a  tightening of  initial margin requirements, which fall outside  the scope  of the master  
agreement , over the past  three months.     
With respect  to securities financing,  survey respondents  reported a general  tightening 
over the past three months  of  the  terms on which  the securities  types included in  the survey are 
1 The December survey collected qualitative inform ation on changes over the previous three 
months in credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over -the-counter (OTC) derivatives 
markets.  In addition to the core set of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about the 
liquidity and functioning of markets for U.S. Treasury securities and equities, a second set of special 
questions focused on changes in aggregate risk limits applicable to other financial institutions, and a final set of special questions asked about clients’ efforts to negotiate credit terms for trades cleared through 
central counterparties.  The 20 institutions participating in the survey account for almost all of the dealer 
financing of dollar -denominated securities for nondealers and are the most active intermediaries in OTC 
derivatives markets.  The survey was conducted during the period from November 15, 2011, to 
November 28, 2011. The core questions ask about changes between September 2011 and November 2011. 
2 Trading REITs invest in assets backed by real estate rather than directly in real estate. 
3 For questions that ask about credit terms , reported net percentages equal the percentage of 
institutions that reported tightening terms (“tightened considerably ” or “tightened somewhat ”) minus the 
percentag e of institutions that reported eas ing terms (“eased considerably ” or “eased somewhat ”). For 
questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the percentage of institutions that reported 
increased demand ( “increased considerably” or “increased somewhat”) minus the percentage of institutions 
that reported decreased demand ( “decreased considerably” or “decreased somewhat”).

funded.  Tightening was more pronounced for  average clients than for  most -favored clients.   For  
each of the types of  collateral covered in the survey , notable  net fractions of respondents  reported 
that liquidity and functioning had deteriorated over the past three months  in the underlying asset  
market .  With regard to conditions  in those markets generally deemed the most liquid, r esponses 
to a set  of special questions  suggested  that liquidity and functioning in  the market for U.S. 
Treasury securities were  little chan ged  since the second quarter, while a  small net fraction of  
dealers r  eported that  conditions in equit y markets had de teriorated  somewhat  over the same 
period.  
Finally, in response to a  set o f  special question s on  client s’  efforts to  negotiate  terms  
applicable to trades  cleared through central counterparties , dealers  indicated that most -favored 
hedge funds  were the counterparty type most intensively seeking to  obtain terms  that entail lower  
margin requirements or  that provide protection against  changes in such requirements.  
COUNTERPARTY  TYPES  
Dealers and  Other Financial I ntermediaries   
In the  December  survey,  all but  two respondents  reported  that the amount  of resources 
and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial  
intermediaries had  increased over the past three months.  In the  September  survey,  three -fourths  
of respondents  noted such an increase.   These responses may  well reflect heightened concerns 
about the potential for  the s ituation  in Europe to negatively affect financial institutions  as well as  
worries stemming from the recent  failure  of MF Global. 
Central Counterparties and Other Financial Utilities  
Two-thirds  of  respondents indicated that  the  amount of resources and attention devoted to 
management of concentrated exposures to central  counterparties and other  financial utilities had  
also  increased  over the past three months.   In the September survey, s lightly more than  one-half  
of  dealers, o n balance, noted an increase.    
Hedge F unds  
The survey responses suggest ed  a modest  tightening of price  and nonprice  terms  
applicable  to hedge funds  over the past three months .  On net, about one-third of  dealers reported 
having tightened  price terms (such  as financing rates)  offered to hedge funds and one-fourth 
reported having tightened nonprice  terms  (including haircuts, maximum  maturity, covenants, 
cure periods, cross -default  provisions, or other documentation features)  across  the spectrum of  
securit ies  financing and OTC derivative transactions.   The institutions  that reported a  tightening 
of  credit  terms  most frequently pointed to a worsening in general market liquidity and functioning  
and to reduced willingness to take on risk  and, to a lesser extent , adoption of more- stringent 
market conventions and deterioration in  the  strength of counterparties a  s the reasons.  Twenty 
percent of respondents, a smaller net fraction than in September, reported  an increase in the 
intensity of efforts by hedge funds  to negotiate more- favorable price and nonprice terms over the

past three months.  More than  one-half of dealers, on balance, indicated that the use of  financial  
leverage by hedge funds, considering the entire range of transactions facilitated,  had decreased  
somewhat  over the past  three months.  Among the subsample of  firms with a significant presence 
in almost  all  of the business areas covered in the survey (broad -scope dealers) , nearly all  report ed  
a decline in the use of  financial leverage.4   Respondents  also  noted that the availability of  
additional unutilized financial leverage  under  agreements currently in place with  hedge funds was  
little changed , on net, over the  past three months, suggesting that  the tightening of  the supply of  
credit, as evidenced  by more -stringent credit terms , was presumably m  atched by a reduction in 
demand.  Finally, nearly one-third of respondents reported that  the provision of  more -favorable 
terms to most -favored hedge funds had increased over  the past  three months.  
Trading R eal Estate  Investment  Trusts 
One-fourth of surv ey respon dents reported  that they had tighten ed  price  terms offered to 
trading REITs , and a smaller net  fraction indicated that they had tighten ed nonprice terms.   
A worsening of market liquidity and functioning, reduced willingness  to take on risk, and a 
deterioration in  the  financial strength of counterparties were  cited as  the  most important  reason s  
for the change  in lending posture .     
Mutual Funds, Exchange -Traded Funds, Pension Plans, and Endowments  
The su rvey responses suggested  that, on balance, there had been little change in  the  price 
and nonprice  credit terms provided to mutual funds, exchange-traded funds  (ETFs) , pension 
plans, and endowments over the  past three months, as well  as the use of leverage by such clients.  
Of  note, one-fourth of respondents  indicated  an increase in  the intensity of efforts by clients  in  
this category to negotiate more- favorable credit  terms , and a similar  net  percentage reported an 
increase in the provision of  more -favorabl e terms to most -favored  clients over  the past three 
months. 
Insurance Companies  
Survey respondents indicated  that price and nonprice  terms applicable to insurance 
companies were basically unchanged over  the past three months  despite a continued  increase in  
the intensity of  efforts  by such clients  to negotiate more -favorable terms.  A modest fraction of  
dealers noted an increase  in the provision of  more -favorable t  erms to most -favored clients over  
the past  three months.    
Sepa rately Managed Accounts  Established with Investment Advisers  
Dealers  indicated  that price and nonprice  terms negotiated by investment  advisers on 
behalf of separately managed accounts were little changed , on net, over the past  three months.   
A  small net fraction of  respondents noted that t he intensity of efforts by these advis ers to 
negotiate more- favorable credit  terms  had increase d during the  survey period ; dealers reported , 
however, that  the use of financial  leverage by this client type  was b asically unchanged .  A small

net percentage of respondents noted an increase in the  provision of  more -favorable terms to   
most -favored clients over  the past three months.  
Nonfinancial Corporations  
About  one-third of respondents  indicated  that they had tight ened somewhat  price terms 
offered to nonfinancial corporations over  the past three months, while one- fifth of dealers  
reported  a tightening of nonprice terms.  Survey respondents  cited  higher internal treasury  
charges for funding  as the single  most  prominent  explanation for the change in lending posture , 
although they also cited a particularly wide range of reasons as important  for this  change.   
One-fifth  of dealers  noted that the  intensity of effort s by nonfinancial corporations to negotiate  
more -favorable terms  had increased over the past three months .   
Mark and Collateral Disputes  
Despite  the apparently heightened focus on management of  concentrated credit exposure  
to dealers  and other financial intermediaries, only a  small  net fraction of  dealers  reported that the  
volume of mark and collateral  disputes with other dealers  had  increased somewhat over the past  
three months.  Similar net shares of respondents noted an increase in  the volume of mark and 
collateral disputes with mutual  funds, ETFs, pension plans, and endowments , as well as with  
investment advis ers  acting  on behalf  of separately managed acccounts.  In addition, a small net  
fraction of respondents  reported  an increase in the duration and persistence of such disputes with 
other dealers.  
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES  
As in the September survey, dealers reported that nonprice terms incorporated in new or  
renegotiated OTC derivatives master  agreements were broadly unchanged  over the p  ast three 
months.5   However, a small  net  fraction of respondents  indicated that they had tightened 
requirements , timelines, and thresholds for posting additional margins  over the past  three months.  
Small net fractions of dealers also noted that they had  tightened  initial margins (which  fall outside  
the scope of  the master agreement) applied  to average clients on contracts referencing most  
underlying  collateral types (underlyings)  over the past three months.  The largest  changes were 
reported with respect to equity derivativ es and, to  a lesser  extent, interest rate derivatives.    
By contrast, initial margin requirements were generally little changed  for most -favored clients.    
A small  net percentage of respondents  noted  an increase in the volume, duration, and persistence  
of ma rk and collateral disputes across underlyings.   
SECURITIES  FINANCING  
As in September 20 11, survey respondents  indicate d a general  tightening  over  the past  
three months  of  credit  terms under which the types of  securities  included i  n the survey are  
financed.  This  tightening was especially evident  for the financing of corporate bonds ( both high

grade and high  yield ),  agency and  non- agency residential mortgage- backed  securities (RMBS ), 
and commercial mortgage -backed securities.  The  apparent  overall tightenin g of terms over the  
past three months  applied to both average and most- favored clients  (though it was less 
pronounced for most -favored clients).   
Dealers reported  th at demand for funding of most securities  was little changed  over the  
past three months.   However , demand for term funding  with a maturity greater than 30 days  
increased for all types of securities.  Most notably,  40 percent of respondents reported  an  
increased demand for  term funding of high-grade bonds.  For  agency RMBS and high-y ield  
corpo rate bonds, the  net  fractions  reporting increased demand for term funding  in the December  
survey were 33  percent  and 29 percent, respectively.  
Broadly consistent with the September  responses, dealers  reported a  further worsening in 
the liquidity  and functi oning of  the underlying asset markets covered by the survey .6   In  
particular, net fractions of respondents ranging between one-third and one -half  indicated  that 
liquidity  and functioning  in these markets had deteriorated over the past  three months.  Howeve r,  
this deterioration was not accompanied by an  increase in reported mark and collateral disputes.      
SPECIAL  QUESTIONS ON MARKET  FUNDING AND  LIQUIDITY  
Some  market observers have report ed  that liquidity has  recently  declined in a number of  
markets, including those generally considered to have the greatest depth and transparency.   A  set  
of special questions queried  dealers about changes since the  end of the second quarter of 2011 in 
the liquidity and functioning of  markets for U.S. Treasury securities  and for equities .  Survey 
respondents reported  that, on balance,  liquidity  and functioning  in the U.S. Treasur y  market had  
remained  basically  unchanged.  By contrast, one- fifth of respondents pointed to a deterioration in 
liquidity  and functioning  in equity market s. 
SPECIAL  QUESTIONS ON COUNTERPARTY  CREDIT  LIMITS  APPLICABLE TO  
OTHER  FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS  
In  recent months, many  financial  firms have been subject  to heightened scrutiny by  
clients and counterparties.  A  second  set of  special questions asked respondents  about changes in  
limits  on counterparty credit exposure to other  financial institutions since the end of the second 
quarter of 2011 and solic ited  the most  important reasons for reported  adjustments of these limits .  
Four- fifths  of respondents indicated  that counterparty credit limits  had  decreased , but only  for 
some specific institutions, while the rest of the respondents  reported  no chang e in these limits .  
Respondents  pointed to a  deterioration in  the  curre nt or expected financial  strength of other  
institutions  and  to  increased strains in global financial  markets as the most important  reasons for  
the change in  limits  on counterparty credit exposure to other financial  institutions.  
6 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repurchase agreements and similar secured 
financing transactions, not changes in the funding market itself.  This que stion is not asked with respect to 
equity markets in the core questions but is included in the December survey as a special question.

SPECIAL  QUESTIONS ON CLIENT S’  EFFORTS TO  NEGOTIATE  TERMS FOR  
TRADES  CLEARED THROUGH  CENTRAL  COUNTERPARTIES   
As increasing volumes of trades are centrally cleared,  clients are reportedly seeking to  
negotiate with dealers terms that address certain specific issues related to  such trades.   A third set  
of special questions asked respondents about demand for margin l ocks,  porting agreements, and 
cross -product margining.   
A margin lock  is  defined for  the  purpose of  this  survey  as a provision that insulate s  
clients over some period of  time from increases  in margin requirements  beyond those imposed by  
central counterparties.  About one-third of respondents  report ed  that these provisions had been a  
significant and widespread topic of  discussion with potential  new clients and with current c lients 
renegotiating agreements, while  about one-third indicated that the issue had arisen in some  
discussions  with clients.   The rest of  the dealers noted  that the issue  had arisen only  occasionally  
or not at all.  This issue  appears  to be particularly important for  the  subsample of broad-scope  
dealers :  Over one -half  of these firms  indicated that margin locks had been a significant and 
widespread topic  of discussion, and another  one-third  reported that the issue had arisen in  some 
discussions.   With regard to  the  client types  that ha d  more intensively pursued the incorporation 
of margin lock provisions  in agreements, dealers  pointed to hedge funds (particularly   
most -favored hedge funds), mutual funds, ETFs, pension plans, and endowments, as well as 
investment advisers operating on behalf of separately managed accounts.     
A porting agreement  is defined for  the  purpose  of th is  survey as a commitment by a 
dealer  to accept  the novation of centrally  cleared trades previously establ ished with other dealers.  
Only one dealer reported that this provision had been a significant  and widespread topic of  
discussion with potential  new clients and with current clients  renegotiating agreements, but  
another one- third  of respondents reported that  this  provision had arisen in  some discussions with  
such clients.  The rest of  the  respondents noted that the issue had arisen only occasionally or not  
at all.   Dealers indicated that this issue ha d been more intensively pursued by hedge funds, 
particularly  most -favored hedge funds.  
Cross-product margining entails  the computation of margin requirements by a dealer  on a  
portfolio basis .  Reflecting the recognition of  diversification benefits, this  approach will in 
general reduce the requirement  when there are potentially offsetting trades, including those  that 
are no t  cleared or  are cleared through multiple clearing  organizations.  None of the respondents 
indicated that this  approach to computing margi n requirements had been a significant and 
widespread topic  of discussion with potential new clients and with current c lients renegotiating  
agreements, but one-half  of dealers noted that the issue had arisen in some discussions .  As with  
margin locks and po rting agreements, hedge funds (particularly  most -favored hedge funds ) were 
said to  be most  intensively pursuing  cross -product margining.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS   
To illustrate some of the  risks to the outlook, we construct  several alternatives to  
the baseline projection using simulations of staff  models.  The first  two scenarios analyze 
risks  to the U.S. economic outlook associated with  Europe’s sovereign debt  crisis.  O ne 
scenario consider s  the effects of a more severe deterioration in European financial  
conditions than in the baseline  with  large r  spillovers to the United States an d the rest of  
the world; the other  scenario assumes that  European policymakers  mak e  unexpectedly  
rapid progress  in  stabilizing conditions  in the euro  area, thereby  reducing uncertainty  in 
global  financial  market s.  In the  third  scenario, we assume that  domestic factors cause the 
sluggish recovery in the  United States to stall and  push the economy into recession, 
which turns out to be severe because of financial fragility and a limited  response  of 
policymakers in  buffer ing the downturn.  In contrast, the fourth scenario features a faster  
recovery  of aggregate spending a  nd production than in the baseline because the process  
of balance sheet repair  and expanding credit availability  proves to be further along than 
we have assumed .  The final  two scenarios consider risks to the outlook for inflation:  
The margin of slack is narrower than assumed in the baseline and than policymakers  
estimate, resulting in more upward pressure on both actual and expected inflation; or, 
alternativ ely,  with s lack in labor and product markets  remaining so persistently elevated  
in the baseline projection, inflation will decline  by more than we anticipate.   
We generate most of  the scenarios using the FRB/US model and an estimated  
policy rule  that resp onds  to core PCE inflation and  a measure of economic slack  based on 
the staff’s estimate of potential output.  The first  two  scenario s  are  generated using the  
multicountry SIGMA model, which uses a different policy rule  for the federal funds rate  
that employs an  alternative concept of resource utilization.1  
1 In the simulations using the FRB/US model, the federal funds rate follows the outcome -based 
rule described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.  In the simulations using SIGMA, the policy rule 
is broadly similar, but uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the 
model ’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of a slow adjustment in wages and 
prices.

European Crisis with  Severe Spillovers  
In this scenario, Europe’s  fiscal and  financial difficulties intensify markedly  in 
coming months and to an even greater degree than in our baseline.  This outcome could 
result from  a disorderly sovereign default, a disruptive  failure of  a large financial  
institution , or because the public loses confidence in the ability of European governments  
to resolve the crisis.  Specifically,  Europe an sovereign and private borrowing costs soar, 
with corporate bond spreads rising 400 basis points above baseline, and household and 
business confidence plummet.  European real GDP declines almost  8 percent  relative to  
the  baseline by the end  of 2012, notwithstanding a 25 percent  real effective  depreciation  
of the euro.  Given substantial cross-border financial and macroeconomic linkages, 
Europe’s difficulties are  assumed to have  very large spillovers to financial markets in  the 
United States and throughout the world.  U.S dom estic demand contracts sharply in  
response to higher borrowing costs (corporate bond spre ads widen by more than  
300 basis points  relative to the baseline ), a much weaker stock market,  and  decreases in  
household and business confidence.  In addition, weaker foreign activity  and the stronger  
dollar depress U.S. net  exports.  All told, U.S. real  GDP contracts  3½ percent  next year  
and the unemployment rate rises to nearly 12 percent by  late 2013.  With substantially  
greater resource slack  and lower import pr ices, overall consumer  prices in the United  
States decline in 2012.2   Under these  conditions, t he federal funds rate remains near zero  
until  late 2016. 
Faster European Recovery  
Although we anticipate that  the European summit on Friday, December 9, will fail 
to stabilize financial conditions and that these conditions will deteriorate further , 
European policymakers  may be able to implement a credible and decisive plan  sooner  
than we anticipate, thereby restoring  financial market confidence more quickly.  In this  
scenario, such progress is achieved and spurs a  faster recovery in Europe with favorable  
spillovers to  the rest of the world.  Specifically, European sovereign and private -sector  
2 The marked rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects the 
forward -looking nature of inflation determination in SIGMA.  Thus, long -run inflation expectations remain 
firmly anchored at 2 percent, producer marginal costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, and 
productivity is weaker (reflecting reduced capital spending).  In addition, import price inflation runs 
significantly higher than in the baseline as the dollar’s initial appreciation is gradually reversed.  Under 
alternative specifications of SIGMA—that, for instance, allow for more structural per sistence in the 
inflation process or a less firm anchoring of inflation expectations— inflation would remain low for a 
considerably longer period.

borrowing costs decline  considerably  next year  with corporate bond spr eads eventually  
falling  more than  150 basis points  relative to baseline ; household and business confidence  
also improve.  As a result, European GDP stays  flat during 2012, rather than declining  
1½ percent  as in the baseline, and then rises almost 2 percent in 2013.  Stronger 
economic activity  in Europe and in other U.S. trading partners, in turn, boosts U.S. real  
exports.  In addition, a more rapid removal of monetary accommodation abroad and 
diminished safe- haven concerns cause the broad real dollar to depreciate 10 percent  
relative to baseline by the end  of 2012, thereby stimulating U.S. net exports further.  
Moreover, U.S. domestic demand is strengthened by improved financial  conditions, 
including diminished risk premiums in U.S. markets, and heightened confidence.   All told, U.S. real GDP rises  about 3½ percent  on average over the next two years, the 
unemployment rate falls to  7½ percent by the end  of 2013, and core PCE inflation 
increases  to nearly 2 percent in  2012 and 2013.  Under these  conditions, the federal funds  
rate begins to rise somewhat earlier, and subsequently climbs appreciably faster, than in 
the baseline.   
Homegrown Recession  
The economic  recovery has been disappointingly slow and remains tenuous , 
weighed down by a  depressed  housing sector, tight  credit  conditions, ongoing  balance 
sheet repair , and weak employment and income  growth.  We could be wrong about the  
amount  of restraint that will be imposed by these  factors .  Accordingly, this scenario  
assume s  that—relative to baseline —households and firms become more pessimistic and 
financial  stress intensifies .  As a result,  the recovery  stalls and the economy  slips into 
recession  early next  year.   Because discretionary  fiscal policy does  not respond to the  
weakness,  monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound until later in the  
decade, and the financial  position of many households and firms is already  impaired, t he 
downturn proves to be severe.  All told, r eal GDP contracts  3½ percent  in 2012, causing  
the unemployment rate  to rise to 1 1¾ percent  by late 2013.  Thereafter,  real activity  
gradually recovers but the unemployment  rate is still 8½ percent in  late 2016.  Such 
persistent  and elevated economic slack  puts substantial downward pressure on consumer  
prices and long-run inflation  expectations, resulting in a modest deflation from 2014 to 
2016.3   Under these conditions, the federal  funds rate rem ains near zero  through  2016.  
3 If this FRB/US simulation had been run under full rational expectations, inflation would begin to 
recover more appreciably by the middle of the decade, in a manner more akin to the behavior of inflation in 
the “European Crisis with Severe Spillovers” scenario.

Faster Snapback  
The economy may be further along in the financial recovery process than we have  
assumed :  Household debt service burdens have declined appreciably  and corporate bond 
issuance and C&I lending have been solid .  Moreover, r ecent  indicators  of consumer  
spending  have been  somewhat  stronger than expected , and pent- up demand  for durable  
goods may represent an upside risk to our outlook—f or example, the average age of  
motor vehicles on the road is still rising and the level of the  E&S  capital stock  is 
relatively low .  In this scenario, the underlying pace of consumption and investment is  
stronger than in the baseline, spurred in part by  easier credit conditions, more rapidly  
falling risk premiums , a reduced pace of household deleveraging, and pent-up demand.  
Real GDP rises  about 3¼  percent , on average , in 2012 and 2013, bringing  the 
unemployment rate  down to 7¼ per cent by the  end of 2013, almost 1 percentage point  
below  baseline.   Initially, the stronger pace of  recovery has little effect on inflation 
because greater capital  investment increases labor  productivity (thereby holding down 
unit labor costs) and because long-run inflation expectations  remain  well anchored.  Over  
time, however, tighter labor and product markets  cause inflation to move up more than in 
the baseline.  Largely in response to the stronger pace of  real activity, the  federal funds  
rate begins to rise at  the end of next  year.  
Greater Supply-Side Damage  
In the baseline projection, we have trimmed our estimate of the level of potential 
GDP.  But  the supply side of the economy may have  suffered  greater damage over the 
past several  years than  we have estimated , resulting in greater inflationary pressures than 
we have assumed .  In this scenario, the  current output gap is assumed to be only half  as  
large as in the baseline, and less slack  and lower productivity  imply  higher unit  labor  
costs and greater upward pressure on prices going forward .  These inflationar y forces are 
amplified  by the  assumption that policymakers  only gradually  recognize the 
less-favorable supply-side conditions, which in turn causes long-run inflation 
expectations  to  rise appreciably .  Under these assumptions, real GDP expands about   
¾ percentage point less rapidly per  year, on average, through 2016 than in the baseline, 
partly because households and businesses recognize the weaker trajectory for income and 
earnings.   Mean while , core PCE inflation gradually  moves up to 2¼ percent.  In response 
to higher inflation, the federal  funds rate  begins to rise  about a year earlier  than in the  
baseline.

Further Disinflation  
Of course, the inflation outlook remains subject to downside risks as well.  In 
particular,  the stability of various measures of expected inflation to date may  be  
misleading us about the potential for further disinflation , particularly  given the bas eline 
outlook in which the  economy  is persistently weak .  In this scenario, both expected and 
actual  inflation  drift down steadily  over time, with  inflation reaching zero  by  2015; such 
a  decline in inflation would be in line with the predictions of some  accelerationist Phillips  
curves that the staff monitors.  As disinflationary pressures mount, investors  become 
increasingly concerned about the economy becoming mired in deflation with monetary  
policy persistently constrained by the zero lower bound; as a result , bond and equity  
premiums  rise, thereby modestly damping spending and boosting unemployment relative  
to baseline.  In response to lower inflation and greater economic slack, the  federal funds  
rate remains at its effective lower bound  through 2016.  
OUTSIDE  FORECASTS  
The latest Blue Chip survey  was released on November 10, and so is quite stale; 
for example, it was collected too  early to incorporate the two  most recent labor  market  
reports.  With that caveat, the consensus projection show ed real GDP rising 2.3 percent  
over the four  quarters of  2012, about the same as  the staff projection.  The  Blue Chip 
forecast for the unemployme nt rate at the  end of 2012 was  8.9 percent, above  the staff  
projection of 8.6 percent.  Regarding inflation, the Blue Chip panelists anticipate d that 
the overall  CPI  will increase  2 percent  in 2012, ½ percentage point higher than the staff  
projection.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
