Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
A number of the indicators that we track  in gauging the current and near-future 
pace of economic activity have improve d since the December Tealbook.  Payroll 
employment increased a little more in Decem ber than in the average of the preceding 
several months and the unemployment ra te continued to decline, manufacturing 
production rebounded from a dip in November, and even residential construction has 
shown a bit more vigor recently.  In addi tion, measures of consumer and business 
sentiment have moved up.  However, these developments have not materially exceeded 
our expectations; rather, for the most part, th ey have only been sufficient to validate our 
forecast in previous Tealbooks of a gradually improving pace of real activity.  Moreover, 
despite the bounceback in consumer sentiment from recent lows, consumer spending appears to be on a somewhat shallower trajec tory than we had prev iously expected, and 
federal outlays for defense have been signifi cantly lower than anticipated.  All told, we 
now estimate that real GDP increased at an annu al rate of 3 percent in the fourth quarter 
of 2011 and will rise 1½ percent in the cu rrent quarter, ¼ percentage point and 
½ percentage point less, respectivel y, than in the December Tealbook. 
We also made a small downward adjustme nt to our medium-term projection.  The 
foreign exchange value of the dollar has moved up a little, on balance, since the 
December Tealbook and is anticipated to s ubtract a bit from the demand for U.S. 
products.  Real GDP growth is further tempered by a somewhat higher path for crude oil 
prices, while the changes in our  other conditioning factors are neutral, on balance, for the 
pace of activity:  The effects of  higher stock prices and lower interest rates are mostly 
offset in our projection by a downward revi sion to house prices.  With respect to our 
fiscal assumptions, we have marked down the projected trajectory of defense spending 
over the medium term.  As a result, real GDP  is projected to incr ease 2 percent in 2012, 
about ¼ percentage point less than in th e December Tealbook, and 2½ percent in 2013, 
about unchanged from the previous projection.  This average pace of growth only slightly 
exceeds our estimate of potential.  Accordingly, little progress is made in closing the 
estimated gap in either the ut ilization of the workforce or the productive capacity of the 
overall economy over the next two years.   
The outlook for inflation is about the same as in the December Tealbook.  Core 
PCE inflation appears to be slowing a bout as we thought it would based on our

assessment that last year’s upswing mostly represented the pass-th rough of a surge in 
import and commodity prices.  With labor a nd product market slack projected to remain 
considerable and inflation exp ectations anticipated to hold st eady, we continue to project 
that core PCE inflation will be 1½ percent in both 2012 and 2013.  Given our forecast for 
relatively slight changes in food and energy prices over the next two years, headline 
inflation is expected to run just a touch below core over the medium term. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
In line with the prescription of the outc ome-based policy rule, we continue to 
assume that the FOMC will hold the target fede ral funds rate in the current range of 0 to 
¼ percent until the fourth quarter of 2014, th e same span of time as in the December 
Tealbook.  We also assume that the Comm ittee will maintain the Federal Reserve’s 
current portfolio-related policies.1     
Interest Rates 
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities  has decreased about 25 basis points, on 
net, since the December Tealbook, reflecting in part a downward revision to the market’s 
expected policy path, and we have lowered our projection for the Treasury yield this 
round.  We still expect that sluggish progress toward resolving the European debt crisis 
will continue to result in safe-haven demands  for Treasury securities in coming quarters.  
Even so, as in previous projections, we expect the 10-year Treasury yield to rise 
substantially from the middle of this year through 2013, endi ng that year at 3½ percent—
about 1½ percentage points above its current level.  This proj ected increase reflects the 
movement of the valuation window through the period of near-zero short-term interest 
rates, a gradual waning of the effects of  nonconventional monetary policy, and an 
1 The path of the federal funds rate in the extended baseline projection, and in particular the date 
when conventional monetary policy begins to firm, depends importantly on our use of the estimated 
outcome-based rule to set policy.  If we had instead assumed that the federal funds rate would follow the 
prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) rule, liftoff would not begin until late  2015; an inertial version of this 
rule would delay the onset of conventional tightening until mid-2016.  In contrast, conventional monetary 
policy would begin tightening early this year under the Taylor (1993) rule and in mid-2013 under the first-difference rule.  These various prescriptions make no adjustment for the stimulus provided by the Federal Reserve’s nonconventional policy actions; if they did, the prescribed dates for tightening would be pulled forward.  However, in most cases, the advance in timing would be modest because the staff projects the 
downward pressure on term premiums from the SOMA portfolio to diminish appreciably over the next few 
years.

unwinding of safe-haven demands as apprehensi ons related to the European debt crisis 
eventually abate and the U.S. economic  recovery gains a firmer footing. 
Spreads on BBB-rated corporate bonds and conforming fixed-rate mortgages have 
widened a touch, on net, since the December Tealbook.  These spreads are currently well 
above their typical levels, and, as in previous forecasts, we expect them to narrow 
gradually over the medium term.  However,  given the outlook for limited progress in 
resolving the European situation in the near term, both spreads are expected to be roughly 
flat through the first half of this year before narrowing further out.  Coupled with our forecast for Treasury rates, these assumptions  imply a moderate increase in yields on 
these private instruments over the next two years.    
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
Broad U.S. stock price indexes have incr eased about 3 percent,  on net, since the 
December Tealbook.  We project that stock prices  will be about flat ove r the first half of 
this year and then move up rapidly in the second half of 2012 and in 2013, as investors 
gain confidence that European authorities will make progress toward resolving their fiscal and financial crisis.  On the current  projection, the equity premium will descend 
somewhat from its current extraordinarily high level.     
According to the latest data, home prices in November declined more than we 
expected.  We reacted by reducing the level of  home prices by about 1 percent throughout 
the projection period.  Our forecast calls for th e CoreLogic Home Price Index to decrease 
a bit more than 1 percent in 2012 and to be about unchanged in 2013.   
Fiscal Policy 
We have scaled back our projection for defense spending over the medium term.  
The spend-out of defense appropriations over the past year has persistently fallen short of our expectations.  Even more important, recent information indicates that appropriations for overseas military operations will be smalle r than we had previously expected.  Our 
other fiscal policy assumptions are unchanged.  In partic ular, we assume that the 
2 percentage point payroll tax reduc tion for employees and the Emergency 
Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program —both of which were recently extended 
through the end of February—wil l soon be extended through the end of this year.  We 
also continue to assume that discretionary spending will be restrained by the caps set in 
the Budget Control Act.  In addition, a lthough we assume that the Congress will not

allow the spending sequester tr iggered by the failure of the supercommittee last autumn 
to take full effect in 2013, we expect that  other, more gradual budget-saving measures 
will be enacted to achieve the same $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction over the fiscal 2013–
21 period.   
Given our revised assumptions, we now e xpect federal fiscal policy to impose 
restraint of 0.4 percentage point on the grow th of real GDP in 2012 (excluding multiplier 
effects), 0.1 percentage point more than in the previous Tealbook.  In 2013, federal fiscal policy is still anticipated to impose a drag of about 1 percentage point.
2 
We project the budget deficit to narrow fr om $1.3 trillion (8½ percent of GDP) in 
fiscal year 2011 to $1.1 trillion (7 percent of GDP) and $850 billion (5¼ percent of GDP) 
in fiscal 2012 and 2013, respectively.  As in the December Tealbook, the narrowing of the deficit primarily reflects the a ssumed tightening of fiscal policy.  
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Incoming data indicate that foreign economic  activity decelerated substantially in 
the fourth quarter, and by a little more than  we had expected.  In particular, we now 
estimate that aggregate real GDP growth in the foreign economies stepped down from an 
annual rate of 3½ percent in the third quarter to 2 percent last quart er, the latter figure 
being about ¼ percentage point lower than we projected in the December Tealbook.  Our overall foreign outlook is little changed from the December Tealbook; real GDP is 
projected to rise 2½ percent th is year and 3 percent in 2013.  We continue to believe that 
with a quick resolution to the euro-area crisis unlikely to materialize, financial tensions 
will persist for some time and lead to an appr eciable contraction of GDP in the euro area 
this year, restraining the pace of global economic activity.   
Since the time of the December Tealbook, the dollar has appreciated against the 
euro and has changed little, on net, against mo st other currencies, l eaving the broad real 
dollar about 1 percent higher than we had assumed in December.  From this higher 
starting point we project the broad real dollar to deprecia te 1¾ percent in 2012 and 
3 percent in 2013, with these declines c oncentrated against the emerging market 
2 If the payroll tax reduction and EUC benefits are not extended beyond February, then the 
restraint from federal fiscal policy on real GDP growth this year would be 0.5 percentage point greater.  
With the earlier expiration of these policies, the drag from fiscal policy on real GDP growth in 2013 would 
be 0.35 percentage point less.

currencies.  On average over the forecast period, the level of the broad real dollar is about 
1 percent higher than we projected in the December Tealbook.  
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
Global oil markets have been buffeted by a number of conflicting developments 
in recent weeks.  Spot prices for most grades  of oil are little changed, as greater concern 
over global growth prospects has largely balanced increased fears of potential supply 
disruptions, particularly hei ghtened tensions over Iran’s nuc lear development program.  
The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil closed at $100 per barrel on 
January 17, about the same as at the time of the December Tealbook.  In contrast to spot 
prices, WTI futures prices have risen slightly  since the previous T ealbook; as a result, the 
futures curve slopes down a bit le ss steeply.  In all, we expect  the price of imported oil to 
fall modestly from $104 per barrel in the cu rrent quarter to $101 per barrel by the end of 
2013, about $6 per barrel higher than projec ted in the December Tealbook.  The upward 
revision to the forecast importantly reflect s higher futures prices for both WTI and 
Brent.3  In light of the escalating tensions w ith Iran, the Risks and Uncertainty section 
considers the effects of a significant disruption in global oil supply. 
The broad index of nonfuel commodity pri ces that we follow is, on net, little 
changed since the time of the December Tealbo ok.  The prices of field crops, including 
corn, soybeans, and wheat, have moved up modestly in recent weeks because of concerns 
about growing conditions in Latin America; however, these prices remain well below the 
peaks reached in the first half  of 2011.  Meanwhile, metals prices are little changed, on 
net, from the time of the December Tealbook.  Overall, we expect nonfuel commodity 
prices to increase only sligh tly through 2013, in line with prices from futures markets 
adjusted for staff assumptions regarding the path of the dollar and the global growth 
outlook. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
As noted earlier, we now estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of 
3 percent in the fourth quar ter of 2011, ¼ percentage point less than in our previous 
projection, and that it will rise  just 1½ percent in the curr ent quarter, ½ percentage point 
3 Additionally, because private economists’ forecasts of global economic activity have moved 
down closer to ours, we now expect less downward pressure on oil prices going forward, and we have 
raised the adjustment factor we apply to the futures curves.

 less than before.  These downward revisions  mostly reflect sharply weaker incoming 
information on defense spending and a somewhat more moderate pace of increase in 
consumer spending than we had forecast prev iously.  Residential construction, which has 
shown a few surprising signs of life, provided a small offset to these downward revisions.  
Turning to the contour of our projection, the expected deceleration in real GDP growth 
this quarter is shaped most importantly by th e pattern of inventory investment, which is 
estimated to have contributed more than 1½ percentage points to real GDP growth last 
quarter but is expected to be a bout neutral in the current quarter. 
The Labor Market 
Labor market conditions have firmed somewhat recently.  Total nonfarm payroll 
employment increased 200,000 and private nonfarm payroll employment gained 212,000 
in December—both somewhat faster than in  recent months—and the unemployment rate 
edged down 0.2 percentage point in December to 8.5 percent.4  Other labor market 
indicators have also shown some improvement:  Initial claims for unemployment insurance have, on net, conti nued to move down, households upgraded their expectations 
of future labor market conditions after having tamped them down during the summer, and firms report that they expect to step up th eir rate of hiring in  the first quarter.  
Nonetheless, these indicators have improved le ss than generally would be consistent with 
the decline in the unemployment rate over the past four months.      
In light of this information and the weaker output growth that we have in this 
projection, we have marked up our near-term labor market forecast only slightly.  In particular, we now expect that private payroll gains will average 150,000 per month in 
the first quarter; this figure is about 10,000 per month stronger than in the December 
Tealbook after adjusting for the anticipated payback in January from the overstated 
December gain.  With state and local governme nts expected to make further cuts to 
payrolls in response to budget pressures, total payr oll employment is exp ected to increase 
about 125,000 per month through March.  We e xpect the unemployment rate to edge 
back up to 8.7 percent in the first quarter, a touch below our proj ection in the December 
Tealbook.   
                                                 
4 As we saw last year, the rise in payroll employment in December seems to have been 
exaggerated to some degree by a temporary increase in hiring by package delivery firms due to online 
retailing, which—as a relatively recent phenomenon—is  probably not yet fully captured in the BLS’s 
seasonal adjustment procedure.  We expect the payroll gain in January to be held down somewhat in seasonally adjusted terms as those workers are laid off.

 The Industrial Sector 
Manufacturing production posted a solid gain in the fourth quarter.  While a 
portion of this strength reflected  the continued recovery in th e motor vehicle supply chain 
from last year’s earthquake in Japan and the more recent flooding in Thailand, recent 
production gains outside the moto r vehicle sector also have been relatively firm.  After 
jumping nearly 1 percent in December, manufacturing output appears poised to 
decelerate in coming months, in part as th e temporary boost to factory output resulting 
from the recovery of the motor vehicle supply chain wanes.  Indeed, although the 
available indicators of near -term production changes—such as the new-orders diffusion 
indexes from the national and regional manufacturing surveys—have improved in recent months, they continue to suggest near-term ga ins in factory output th at are a bit less rapid 
than those we have seen since the summer.  Nevertheless, after fact oring in the strong 
increase in IP for December, manufacturing outpu t is now expected to rise at an annual 
rate of 4 percent this quart er, 1¼ percentage points stronger than in the previous 
Tealbook. 
Household Spending   
Real PCE appears to have increased at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter.  
Sales of light motor vehicles rose to an annual rate of 13½ million units last quarter, 
1 million units higher than in the third quarter when supply constraints related to the 
earthquake in Japan were still limiting sales to  some degree.  However, the increase in 
spending on goods other than motor vehicles was more moderate, and the available data 
suggest that spending on services has been somewhat restrained. 
If, as in our baseline projection, energy pr ices are stable in coming months and the 
payroll tax cut is extended through the end of  this year, then th e job gains that we 
anticipate should show through to  a moderate increase in real  disposable income over the 
near term.  Nevertheless, households’ expectat ions regarding their future incomes remain 
bleak, and consumer sentiment remains at re latively low levels despite having improved 
noticeably over the past several months.  A ll told, we now estimate that real PCE rose 
2¼ percent in the fourth quarter and look for a 2 percent increase in the current quarter.  
This trajectory is a bit weaker than in our previous projection, re flecting a disappointing 
retail sales report for December. 
Recent indicators of single-family housing activity—such as starts, permit 
issuance, and home sales—hint at incremen tal increases in demand over the past few

 months.  However, activity remains at deep ly depressed levels, as mortgage credit 
remains restrictive, the stock of vacant homes is still abundant , and credit availability for 
builders continues to be tight .  Accordingly, while we have taken on board the modestly 
better news in this sector and have raised our projection for homebuilding a bit, we still 
expect single-family starts to edge up in th e first quarter only to an average annual rate 
approaching 450,000 units.  In response to in creased demand for apartments and falling 
vacancy rates, multifamily starts have slowly risen from very low levels over the past 
year or so, and we expect further moderate gains in coming months.     
Business Investment  
Real business spending on equipment and so ftware (E&S) appears to have risen at 
an annual rate of only 3 per cent in the fourth quarter after posting a sizable gain of 
16 percent in the third quarte r.  Although spending on high-tech equipment has held up 
reasonably well in recent months, spending on a broad range of other equipment appears 
to have pulled back in the fourth quarter af ter a third-quarter surg e.  Forward-looking 
indicators are mixed:  Some indicators of  business sentiment and of capital spending 
plans have improved lately, but corporate bond spreads rema in elevated and analysts’ 
earnings expectations for producers of capita l goods remain subdued.  As a result, we 
expect E&S spending to rise at  only a 2 percent pace in the current quarter, similar to the 
previous quarter’s pace. 
After two quarters of surprisingly la rge increases, real investment in 
nonresidential structures appears to have dece lerated sharply in the fourth quarter and is 
expected to decline in  the current quarter.5  The architectural billings index—which is 
reasonably well correlated with changes in  outlays two to three quarters hence—has 
moved up recently but remains consistent with  near-term decreases in spending outside 
the drilling and mining sector.  In contrast, we continue to expect activity in the drilling 
and mining sector to rise at robust rates ove r the next few quarters, supported by the high 
price of crude oil and by the ongoing diffusion of technologies that have increased the 
expected profitability of drilling.  
Real inventory investment in the nonfarm business sector looks to have picked up 
noticeably in the fourth quarter—contributing more than 1½ percentage points to the rise in 
                                                 
5 Outside of drilling and mining, activity likely wo uld have fallen quite noticeably at the end of 
last year if not for an expiring tax provision for a lternative energy projects that probably pulled some 
spending from early this year into the fourth quarter.

 real GDP—after slowing abruptly  in the third quarter.  On the whole, inventory stocks 
generally appear well aligned with sales.  One exception is in motor vehicles, where 
dealers’ stocks remain lean and we an ticipate further stockbuilding—albeit at a 
diminishing pace—in coming quarters.  All tol d, we expect the contribution to real GDP 
growth from inventory investment to be  about neutral in th e current quarter. 
Government  
Incoming data suggest that total real fede ral purchases fell at an annual rate of 
nearly 10 percent in the fourth quarter, pulled down by defense spending that proved 
much weaker than we had expected.  Gi ven our revised assumptions for defense 
spending, we now anticipate that real federal purchases will only e dge up this quarter; 
previously, we expected a 4 percent rate of increase.  Meanwhile, data for the state and 
local sector continue to suggest  that the rate of decline in real purchases is moderating.  
Over the second half of 2011, state and local employmen t declined 11,000 jobs per 
month, on average, compared with decreases of roughly 30,000 per month over the first 
half of the year.  Moreover, real constructi on expenditures appear to  have leveled out in 
the second half of 2011 following sharp decreases in  the first half of the year.  As in our 
previous projection, we continue to expect  that real purchases  by state and local 
governments will decline at an annual rate of about 1 percent in the fourth and first quarters. 
Foreign Trade  
 After incorporating the trade data for October and November, we estimate that 
real exports of goods and services rose at an annual rate of 5 percent in the fourth quarter.  
In the current quarter we expect exports to increase at a similar pace, supported by 
continued growth in the emerging market ec onomies and by the lagged effect of the 
declines in the dollar that occurred in the first half of 2011.  Real imports of goods and 
services are estimated to have increased 3 pe rcent in the fourth quarter and are projected 
to rise at a 4 percent pace in the current qua rter as imports of oil pick up following a flat 
fourth quarter.  Given the relative strength of  exports, we expect th e contribution of net 
exports to U.S. GDP growth to be about ¼ pe rcentage point in the fourth quarter and to 
be slightly positive in the current quarter, a forecast largely unchanged from the 
December Tealbook.

 Prices and Wages  
Recent data on consumer prices have b een mostly in line with our December 
forecast.  With regard to core inflation, the latest readings continue to suggest that the 
upswing in the spring and summer was mainly due to transitory factors, including the 
first-half surge in commodity and import prices as well as th e increase in motor vehicle 
prices that stemmed from s upply shortages related to the earthquake in Japan.  Indeed, 
prices for motor vehicles declined again in November.  In addition, core prices in the 
fourth quarter were held down by two tempor ary factors—a decline in nonmarket prices 
from which we take little signal, and a weak  reading on prices for medical services that 
appears unlikely to persist.  A ll told, we continue to expect co re PCE prices to rise at an 
annual rate of about 1 percent in the four th quarter and to increase 1½ percent this 
quarter. 
  Consumer food prices look to have deceler ated a bit more than we anticipated in 
the fourth quarter, and we exp ect food price increases to slow further over the first half of 
this year, as the declines in crop prices sin ce last spring continue to pass through to retail 
prices.  Meanwhile, our forecast for consum er energy prices—a sharp decline in the 
fourth quarter and little change  in the current quarter—is largely unrevised relative to the 
previous projection.  All told, total PCE price inflation appears on track to slow from an 
annual rate of 2¼ percent in the third quarter to ½ percent in the f ourth, a bit below our 
previous projection, and then to step back up to 1½ percent in the first quarter. 
We have received little new inform ation on labor compensation since the 
December Tealbook.  Employee compensation in November was lower than anticipated, 
but average hourly earnings in December were stronger than expected.  As a result, we 
continue to estimate that compensation per hour  advanced at an annua l rate of 2¼ percent 
in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to incr ease at the same rate in the current quarter. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
Our medium-term forecast for the growth of real GDP is a little weaker than at the 
time of the December Tealbook.  This change primarily reflects a higher projected 
foreign exchange value for the dollar, a littl e higher path for oil prices, and a weaker 
trajectory for defense spending.  The other factors shaping the broad contour of our 
projection are largely the same as in the prev ious projection.  In pa rticular, as before, 
developments in Europe are expected to cas t a pall over the U.S. economy during the first 
half of this year; thereafter,  Europe-related concerns are assumed to abate gradually.

 Similarly, the adverse effects of impaired credit availability are anticipated to ebb slowly 
during the next two years, leading to fu rther increases in consumer and business 
confidence and causing households and businesse s eventually to become more responsive 
to the low level of interest rates.  In contrast, federal fiscal policy is expected to become substantially more restrictive over time, curtailing the growth rate of real GDP by a full 
percentage point in 2013.  Moreover, as discus sed earlier, we project a substantial rise in 
long-term interest rates through the end of next  year.  In all, real GDP is expected to 
increase 2 percent in 2012 and 2½ percent in 2013, the same pace as the assumed rate of 
growth in potential output this year and a li ttle faster than potential growth next year.   
As noted earlier, the path for the dollar is  a little higher in this projection.  
Accordingly, we trimmed our outlook for e xport growth.  Neverthe less, we think that 
continued increases in demand from the emerging market economies will support gains in 
U.S. exports overall.  As a result, real exports  of goods and services are expected to rise 
about 5 percent in both 2012 and 2013, about ¼ percentage point slower in each year than in the previous projection.  Meanwhile, real im ports are forecast to increase at a modest 
4 percent annual rate, on average, this year  and next, consistent with the relatively 
lackluster pace of U.S. GDP growth.  On net,  because imports still exceed exports, trade 
is expected to make an essentially zero ar ithmetic contribution to real GDP growth over 
the next two years, a slightly weaker  forecast than in the December Tealbook. 
We also have increased the projected drag from government spending over the 
medium term relative to that in our previ ous forecast.  As before, we expect federal 
discretionary spending to be restrained by th e Budget Control Act.  But, as discussed 
earlier in “Key Background Factors,” we now think that appropriations for overseas 
military operations will be smaller than we  had previously expected, and we have 
tempered the anticipated rebound in defense sp ending this year from the surprisingly low 
level of spending relative to appropriations in 2011.  As a result, we now expect real 
federal purchases to fall 1 percent in 2012 a nd 4 percent in 2013, a bit more than in the 
December Tealbook.  In the state and local sector , we continue to see an anemic recovery 
in real purchases.  Although state tax revenues are rising at a solid pa ce, federal stimulus 
grants are being phased out and tax collections  (especially property taxes) at the local 
level have been weak.  In this tight fisc al environment, we expect state and local 
purchases to change little, on ne t, over the projection period.

 The other factors influencing our medium -term projection are mostly unrevised.  
As we noted in the previous Tealbook, the news  during the past severa l months about real 
disposable personal income (DPI) has been  very weak.  Although we have taken down 
the trajectory of consumer spending in respons e to that news, we have not done so to the 
full extent called for by a mechanical readi ng of our models.  The box “The Role of 
Surprisingly Weak Income Data in the PC E Projection” provides our rationale for 
tempering our response to the income data.  Al l told, we continue to expect spending to 
accelerate in 2012 as the growth in real DP I steps back up and as consumers become 
more confident about the economic outlook.   
As before, we expect a very slow recove ry in the housing sector over the medium 
term.  The recent data on starts, permits, and new home sales have been slightly 
encouraging.  However, access to mortgage  credit is still ex ceedingly tight, and 
households remain pessimistic and uncertain about their future incomes and about the 
direction of house prices; thes e factors are likely to wei gh on the demand for housing for 
some time.  Moreover, the stock of vacant houses remains sizable, and the flow of homes 
from foreclosure into the resale market is e xpected to remain substantial.  Accordingly, 
our projection calls for single-family housing star ts to rise only gradually to an annual 
rate of 560,000 units by the end of 2013, a pace we judge to be far below the longer-run 
demand for housing. 
In the business sector, we have not mate rially changed our vi ew of the way E&S 
investment is progressing.  In particular, we continue to view many firms as being 
hesitant to invest despite having the cash to do so.  As firms grow more confident about 
the economic outlook and as financing conditions  for smaller businesses improve further, 
we expect business spending to accelerate somewhat.  As a result, growth in real E&S 
outlays is projected to step up from about 4 percent in 2012 to about 6½ percent in 2013; 
these moderate rates of increase are consistent  with only a slow expansion of the capital 
stock.    
Our outlook for business investment in nonr esidential structures remains sluggish.  
Outside of drilling and mining, investment is ex pected to be essentia lly flat, on net, over 
the next two years, reflecting the weak funda mentals for this sector :  Vacancy rates are 
still elevated, valuations for commercial re al estate remain depressed, and financing 
conditions continue to be diffi cult.  In contrast, outlays for drilling and mining structures 
are anticipated to pe rsist at high levels over the pr ojection period, although spending

 The  Role of Surprisingly  Weak  Income Data  in the PCE Projection  
Real disposable  personal  income (DPI) has been considerably  weaker than  we had 
expected  in the fall.  Indeed, real  DPI now looks to have edged up  just $40 billion  (or 
½ percent) over  2011; at the time  of the October Tealbook,  we anticipated  an increase of  
close to $160  billion (or 1½ percent),  as shown in  the table  below.1  The meager  gains in 
personal income—which  are also reflected  in the very subdued  increases  in gross 
domestic income  (GDI) over the  second and third quarters—have  weighed on our 
projection  of consumer  spending  for this year and  next. 
 
Despite the slow growth in real disposable  income, consumption  expenditures  in the 
second half of last year seem  to have held up reasonably  well, and,  as a result, the 
personal saving rate fell from  5 percent  in the first half of the year to around 4 percent in  
the second half—a decline that seems out of line with the weaker consumer  sentiment 
and lower household  wealth over the same  period.   
 
The Board  staff’s preferred  consumption  models react to the relatively  high level of 
consumption  (given the  level of income and other determinants)—and  hence the 
relatively  low saving rate—by  projecting  that future consumption  growth will slow  
enough to bring the level of consumption  back in line with income  and other observable 
explanatory  variables.   In other words, the models imply that surprises  in the saving rate 
are unwound  subsequently.   The implications  of one such model are  shown by  the blue 
bars in the figure on the facing page:  According  to this model, the  downward  revisions  to 
income over the  past two Tealbooks  imply, all else  being equal, reductions  in the growth 
rate of PCE of close to ½ percentage point in  2012 and about ¼ percentage point in  2013.   
 In the baseline forecast,  we have discou nted somewhat  the implications  of this and 
similar models  for the PCE  outlook for the following  reasons.   For one thing, real ‐time 
readings on  spending  and income are subject to considerable  measurement error.   One 
interpretation  of the relative strength  of consumption  recently is that the currently  
published  data may understate  the actual level of disposable income.   (Indeed, the  
deceleration  in published  compensation  in the middle of the year seems out  of step with

 the stability in both employment  growth and the unemployment  rate observed  over the  
same period.)  Moreover,  during the past decade, there has  been some  tendency  for 
large income revisions  in a quarter—such  as the recent downward  revision to second ‐
quarter compensation—to  be partially unwound  subsequently.   To the extent that  the 
currently published  estimates  of income are too low,  the outl ook for consumption  should 
be brighter than a mechanical  reading of the model results  would indicate.   Similarly, 
current estimates  of consumption  may be too high, in which case the level of  actual 
consumption  would be better aligned with income  than is now apparent;  accordingly,  
there would  be less reason to project a  slower growth rate of consumption  going 
forward.2    
 
Even if income and consumer  spending were  measured  without error, a standard  PCE 
model might still overstate  the implications  of the current estimated  imbalance between 
consumption  and income for future  consumption  growth because  these apparent  
imbalances  may instead reflect factors or behavior  that the model  does not capture.  For 
example,  changes in credit conditions,  income uncer tainty, or  the proportion  of current 
income that is perceived  to be transitory  could all have important  influences  on the 
saving rate.  However,  because we  cannot accurately  observe or estimate these 
variables,  the ability of our models to condition  on them is very limited.    
 After weighing  the various interpretatio ns of the recent income  data, we  revised down  
our projection  of consumption  growth from the October Tealbook  to the January 
Tealbook  (the red bars in the figure below) by a little less than  our preferred  model 
would have suggested  (the blue bars).  
  
 
 
                                                 
2 Although  understated  income and overstated  consumption  have similar implications  for 
consumption  growth over  the projection,  they have opposite implications  for the level of consumption

 growth in this sector should moderate in re sponse to lower projected prices for natural 
gas.  
Finally, inventory investment is projected to have only a small influence on real 
GDP growth this year and next.  As noted ea rlier, stocks currently  appear well aligned 
with sales in most sectors, and thus we expect the pace of inventory accumulation to 
about match the rise in final sa les during the projection period.  
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU  
We have made no changes in this projecti on to our estimates of aggregate supply.  
We continue to assume that potential GDP will increase roughly 2 percent in both 2012 
and 2013, and we have retained our assumption that the NAIRU will remain at 6 percent 
through 2013.6 
Productivity and the Labor Market 
With output growth coming in a little weak er than we had expected even as the 
labor market has improved by more than we had anticipated, we have marked down our 
estimates of the increase in pr oductivity in the near  term.  These revisions have brought 
the level of productivity down to our estimate of  its trend level more quickly than we had 
anticipated in the December Tealbook.  Ov er the remainder of the medium-term 
projection period, we expect firms to increase  their labor input about  in step with the 
modest gains anticipated in output; thus, we l ook for productivity to rise at a pace similar 
to its trend rate.  
With little acceleration in economic activity projected over the medium term, we 
expect the pace of private employment grow th to hold fairly steady, with monthly job 
gains averaging 160,000 in 2012 and 170,000 in 2013.  Meanwhile, we expect state and 
local employment to continue to decline this year, though by less than in recent years, 
and to rise modestly next y ear, as budget pressures diminish  somewhat.  With these tepid 
employment gains, the unemployment rate  edges down to 8¼ percent by the end of 2013, 
                                                 
6 Our estimate of the short-run “effective” NAIRU  (which includes the influence of extended and 
emergency unemployment benefits) is also unrevised in this projection.  It remains at 6.4 percent through 
the end of 2012 and then declines toward the lo ng-run NAIRU, nearly closin g the gap between the two 
measures by the end of 2013 when the extended unem ployment benefits are almost fully wound down.

 the same as in the December Tealbook; most of this decline reflec ts downward pressure 
on labor force participation from the expected phase-out of EUC benefits.  
Resource Utilization 
By our estimates, economic slack rema ins considerable, and we expect no 
material progress to be made in whittling it down over the projection period.  For 
example, the unemployment rate  in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 2¼ percentage points 
above our estimate of the effective NAIRU, and we expect this gap to persist through 
2013.  Similarly, the output gap is projected to remain wide throughout the medium-term 
projection.  The extended period of labor market slack is likely to be associated with a 
continuation of other adverse labor market conditions, including below-trend labor force 
participation and an unusually large concentration of workers experiencing long-term 
unemployment spells. 
Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly reflects trends in the 
labor force, our concept of capacity for the industrial sector focuses on the capability of 
plants to produce with the equipment that is  in place and ready to operate, and not on the 
potential workforce.  As a result, with ma nufacturing output rising moderately over the 
projection period and with manufacturing capacity expanding only modestly (after having contracted outright during the recession), ex cess capacity in this sector is taken up 
relatively quickly.  Indeed, th e factory operating rate rises 2¾ percentage points over the 
course of the next two years,  to 78¼ percent, just a bi t below its long-run average. 
Prices and Compensation  
 We expect that the wide margin of la bor market slack, along with low rates of 
price inflation, will continue to restrain la bor costs over the forecast period.  Both the 
Productivity and Cost measure of nonfarm hourly compensation and the employment cost 
index are projected to rise about 2¼ per cent per year in 2012 and 2013, unchanged from 
the December Tealbook.  Combined with the moderate gains in productivity that we 
project, these increases in compensation impl y only a small rise in unit labor costs this 
year and next.  
After falling at an estimated annual rate of ¾ percent in the final quarter of 2011, 
prices for core imported goods are expected to decline at a 1¼  percent rate in the current 
quarter; this decrease is sli ghtly larger than projected in the December Tealbook because 
of the recent appreciation of the dollar.  These price declines stand in sharp contrast to the

 sizable increases observed in the first half  of 2011; both the earlier increase and the 
recent declines were driven largely by fluctu ations in commodity prices.  Core import 
prices are expected to acceler ate gradually to about a 1½ per cent rate of increase in 2013, 
as commodity prices flatten out a nd the dollar begins to depreciate. 
Inflation expectations have been little changed since the time of the December 
Tealbook.  Median expectations from the Michig an survey ticked up 0.1 percentage point 
in January at both the 1-year and 5-to-10-year  horizons but are stil l down somewhat from 
the middle of last year; the 5-to-10-year expe ctations stand near the lower edge of the 
narrow range they have moved in for most of  the past 10 years.  Inflation compensation 
5 to 10 years ahead derived from TIPS spreads ha s changed little, on net,  in recent weeks. 
As in previous Tealbooks, we anticipate that subdued labor costs and low levels 
of resource utilization will continue to rest rain core PCE inflation over the projection 
period but that stable infla tion expectations will head o ff any actual disinflation.  We 
continue to project that core  PCE inflation will be about  1½ percent in both 2012 and 
2013, the same as in the December Tealbook.  Given our forecast of relatively small 
changes in food and energy prices, headline infl ation is expected to run just a bit below 
core in both 2012 and 2013. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff forecast to  2016 using the FRB/US model and staff 
assumptions regarding long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  
The contour of the long-run outlook de pends on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy aims to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent in the long run, 
consistent with the majority of longer-term inflation projections provided by 
FOMC participants at the November meeting. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities follow the baseline portfolio 
projections reported in Book B.  The projected longer-run decline in the System’s holdings is forecast to contribut e about 30 basis points to the rise in 
the 10-year Treasury yi eld from 2013 to 2016. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds decline gradually to normal levels, and banks ease their lendi ng standards somewhat further.

  The federal government budget deficit (N IPA basis) narrows from 5¼ percent 
of GDP in 2013 to 4 percent of GDP in  2016.  This narrowing reflects both 
the effects of the economic recovery on tax receipts and budgetary restraint 
consistent with the Budget Control Act. 
 The foreign exchange value of the dolla r is assumed to depreciate 2¼ percent 
per year in real terms from 2014 to 2016.  The price of crude oil is roughly flat 
beyond 2013.  Foreign real GDP expands, on average, 3½ percent per year 
from 2014 through 2016, slightly above its trend rate. 
 The NAIRU declines from 6 percent in  late 2013 to 5½ percent in late 2016 
as the functioning of the labor market gradually improves, and settles in at 
5¼ percent in the long run.  Potential GDP expands 2½ percent per year on 
average from 2014 to 2016. 
The economy enters 2014 with  output still considerably  below its potential, the 
unemployment rate well above the projected NAIRU, and inflation below the assumed 
objective.  In the long-run forecast, improvi ng confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and 
supportive financial conditions enable real GDP to rise at an average annual rate of 
3¾ percent from 2014 to 2016.  With actual out put expanding signifi cantly faster than 
potential, labor market conditi ons improve markedly.  Neve rtheless, the unemployment 
rate is 6½ percent at the e nd of 2016, still 1 percentage point above the assumed NAIRU.  
With slack-related downward pressures gradua lly abating, inflation edges up slightly but 
is still around 1½ percent in 2016. 
Relative to the November projection—the  last time that Committee participants 
submitted economic projections as part of the SEP process—the staff forecast for 
unemployment at the end of 2014, at 7.8 percent, is revised up  ½ percentage point.  Half 
of this revision reflects a change in our assumption about the pace at which labor market functioning will improve over the next severa l years.  (We still have the long-term 
NAIRU heading ultimately to 5¼ percent, but getting there more slowly; as a result, the 
NAIRU in 2014 is ¼ percentage point higher now than it was in the November 
projection.  This revision was introdu ced between the November and December 
Tealbooks.)  The other half of the upward revisi on to the unemployment rate in the fourth 
quarter of 2014 reflects our expectation that the economic re covery will proceed at a 
slower pace than we anticipated in November .  The inflation projection for both core and 
topline PCE inflation in 2014 is  largely unrevised relative to the November Tealbook.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Incoming data point to a substantial deceleration of foreign economic activity  
during the last quarter.  We now estimate that economic growth  abroad stepped down 
from an annual pace of 3½ percent in the third quarter to 2 percent in the fourth, a bit 
lower than projected in the December Tealbook.  This slowdown reflects a number of factors.  First, economic growth in several of our key trading partners —Canada, China, 
Japan, and Mexico —had been running unusually fast in the third quarter and some 
slowing was anticipated.  Second, financial stresses and fiscal consolidation appear to be pushing the euro  area into recession.  Third, the weakness in  the euro  area has spilled 
over to the United Kingdom and  contributed to lower external demand in a number of 
other economies.  Finally, the floods in Thailand led to an even deeper plunge in activity in that country than we anticipated and also restrained  activity in  some other Asian 
economies through supply chain linkages.      
Our outlook for foreign activity over the next two years is little changed, with 
aggregate growth abroad projected to be only 2½ percent this year —a pace well  below 
trend —and then 3 percent in 2013.  The contour of our outlook represents a combination 
of rather different trajectories across different regions of the world.  In emerging Asia, 
Chinese growth remains at about 8 percent and growth in the rest of the region returns to 
a near -trend pace as the adverse effects of the floods  in Thailand abate.  Economic 
growth in Latin America should also stay reasonably solid this year and next.  
Conversely, in the euro area, we continue to believe that substantial obstacles remain to a 
quick resolution of the crisis, and we see output contract ing through the end of the year, 
with only a meager  recovery in train next year.     
To be sure, the tone of European financial conditions appears to have improved 
somewhat since the time of the Decemb er Tealbook, with short-term funding pressures 
having eased and sovereign bond spreads for peripheral economies having declined, at least for shorter maturities .  Even S&P’s sovereign  debt downgrades for several euro -area 
economies , announced a few days ago, had little adverse effect , suggesting that these 
downgrades had largely been priced in .  Nevertheless, European financial markets remain 
stressed, and the cumulative effect of the crisis on credit extension and confidence will 
undoubtedly continue to weigh on economic activity in the region.  Moreover, although 
the provision of ample liquidity by the ECB has helped stabilize the situation, little other

  progress has been made to strengthen the firewalls needed to protect embattled European 
governments from a renewed run on their debt.  Thus, a further deterioration of financial 
conditions in the region remains likely, not least because talks on Greek debt restructuring have so far failed to reach agreement, and we still do not see investor confidence start ing to return until later this year a fter policymakers are forced to take 
stronger actions.  Moreover, t here remains some chance that financial conditions could 
deteriorate much more severely than we anticipate in our baseline projection.  (See the 
“European Crisis with Severe Spillovers” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.)    
Inflation abroad held steady at an annual rate of a little more than 3 percent in the 
fourth quarter.  This estimate is a bit lower than projected in the December Tealbook, 
largely reflecting a faster abatement of food price pressures in emerging market economies (E MEs), particularly in China.  We expect foreign inflation to moderate 
further this year and next, to about 2¼ percent, as resource slack persists and as price 
pressures from previous increases in commodity prices continue to diminish.  Since the time of th e December Tealbook, most central banks left policy rates unchanged while the 
ECB and the Central Bank of Chile loosened monetary policy.  In several foreign economies, further policy easing is expected.   
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES   
We now estimate that r eal GDP in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) rose at 
an annual pace of only about ½ percent in the fourth quarter, nearly ½ percentage point less than projected in the December Tealbook.  In Japan and the United Kingdom, activity surprised on the downside; Japanese exports continued to fall and U.K. consumer 
and business confidence dipped to levels not seen since 2009.  In the euro area, incoming 
data support our view that the region has entered a moderate recession.  But the Canadian economy seems to b e holding up better.  Going forward, we continue to expect AFE 
growth to remain a lackluster ½ percent in the first half of 2012, held down by the euro-
area recession, before picking up to a 1¾ percent pace by the end of 2013.    
Headline inflation in the AFEs is estimated to have risen to an annual rate of 
2¾ percent in the fourth quarter from a rate of 1 percent in the third.  Th e acceleration in 
prices, which we had anticipated in the December forecast, largely reflected a series of temporary factors , which started unwinding toward the end of last year.  Accordingly, w e 
project that inflation will slow to 1½  percent in the first quarter and, reflecting persistent 
and substantial output gaps, average about 1¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast

  period.  This forecast is a touch higher than projected in the previous Tealbook, reflecting 
a somewhat more elevated path for energy prices .  Amid weak growth prospects and 
moderating inflation, we expect that the major foreign central banks will take addi tional 
measures to ease monetary policy conditions .   
Euro Area 
Recent indicators lead us to estimate that euro -area real GDP contracted at an 
annual rate of 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter, a bit more than expected in the December 
Tealbook.  Preliminary indications are that German GDP contracted at nearly a 1 percent  
pace.  More broadly, euro- area retail trade and industrial production fell further in 
November, and the unemployment rate, at 10.3 percent, remains at its highest level since 
June 1998.  In December, economic sentiment edged down and the composite PMI 
stayed in contractionary territory, although the latter improved relative to previous months.  However, we slightly reduced the magnitude of the projected contraction in 2012, as the recent depreciation of the euro is expected to boost euro- area exports.  We 
now expect GDP to fall 1¼ percent in 2012, about ¼ percentage point less than previously anticipated, before increasing at a s till-weak ½ percent pace in 2013.   
Euro -area headline inflat ion spiked to an annual rate of about 4 percent in the 
fourth quarter from just 1¼ percent in the third , with the largest increases in categories 
most affected by a recent change in seasonal adjustment procedures.  However, inflation  
in other cate gories re mained subdued.  Amid sizable resource slack, we expect inflation 
to come in just over 1½ percent this year and fall a bit further, to 1¼ percent , in 2013.  At  
its December 8 meeting, the ECB cut its benchmark policy rate to 1 percent , lowered the 
required  reserve ratio from 2  percent to 1  percent, eased collateral requirements for 
refinancing operations, and announced three- year long er-term refinancing operations for 
December 21 and February 29 .  At its January 12 meeting, the ECB left policy rates 
unchanged.  We continue to expect that the ECB will keep its benchmark policy rate at 1 percent over the forecast period and provide significant liquidity support to banks, 
resulting in very low short -term market interest  rates.  
The ECB’s actions in December contributed to the relative calm seen in European 
financial markets over the past month (see further details in the Financial Developments 
section).  However, beyond the ECB’s actions, EU leaders so far have done little to flesh 
out the policy measures announced in early December, which included strengthening 
fiscal rules and coordination, augmenting IMF resources, and introducing the permanent

  backstop facility, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), in mid-2012, about a year 
earlier than originally planned.1  Euro -area finance ministers have committed  
 €150 billion in new bilateral loans to augment IMF resources, but it is unclear what other 
countries will contribute and how the IMF will handle the new resources.  The ESM appears on track for introduction by midyear, but that will do little to expand EU financial backstops given the €500 billion combined ceiling on the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF) and the ESM; so far, German officials have resisted raising that 
ceiling.  In response to concerns about policy weaknesses, in mid- January S& P 
downgraded the sovereign debt ratings of Austria, France, several other European countries, and the EF SF, further weakening the firewall intended to contain financial 
contagion. 
We assume that, in the absence of an effective firewall, any number of adverse 
shocks will cause financial conditions in the euro area to start deteriorating again.  One near-term source of risk is the contentious negotiations between the Greek government 
and its creditors over the “voluntary” write-down of Greek debt; should these talks fail to result in  an agreement, additional EU–IMF funding could be jeopardized, raising the 
likelihood of a disorderly default.  We anticipate  that a further steep deterior ation in 
market conditions would force policymakers to eventually overcome domestic political 
constraints and take more aggressive actions to stabilize the situation, but that investor 
confidence would be restored only gradually thereafter.   
Japan  
Real G DP growth in Japan is estimated to have declined sharply from an annual 
rate of 5½ percent in the third quarter to just ½ percent in the fourth.  Much of this slowdown was anticipated in the December Tealbook, reflecting the waning of the rebound from the March earthquake and tsunami, the effects on parts supplies of the floods in Thailand, and the appreciation of the yen.  However, incoming data on household spending and exports point to a sharper slowdown than we had  anticipated , in 
part because of a bigger effect from the floods than we had previously built in .  As a 
result,  we lowered our fourth-quarter growth estimate by 1½ percentage points.  We 
project that  real GDP growth will rebound to 2¾ percent in the current quarter , somewhat 
                                                 
1 The ESM, wh ich was originally intended to replace the European Financial Stability Facility on 
its expiration in 2013, is designed to channel liquidity to euro- area governments whose access to market 
financing is impaired.

  higher than in the December Tealbook.  Beyond the f irst quarter, growth should average 
roughly 1½ percent through the end of 2013. 
As expected, prices resumed their decline in November, supporting our estimate 
that inflation was negative ½  percent  in the fourth quarter.  We project deflation to persist 
amid sizable output gaps.   Given the weak outlook for both output and inflation, we 
anticipate that the  Bank of J apan will further expand the size of its asset purchase 
program.  With the budget deficit projected to rise to nearly 9  percent of GDP this year, 
the Noda administration is pushing for a hike in the value- added tax (VAT) to begin 
restoring fiscal sustainability , although we do not assume such a hike over the forecast 
period. 
United Kingdom 
In the United Kingdom, recent data on activity have been markedly weak, 
prompting us to lower our estimate for fourth-quarter real GDP growth by ¾ percentage 
point to negative ¼ percent .  In November, industrial production continued to decline and 
retail s ales edged down.  In addition, indicators of consumer and business confidence fell 
further.  However, both the manufacturing and services PMIs moved up in December, suggesting that conditions improved toward year- end, and as a result , we carried  forward 
only part of the fourth- quarter weakness.  Even so, we now project that U.K. real GDP 
will rise only ½  percent in 2012, ¼ percentage point less than projected in the December 
Tealbook.  In 2013, economic growth is projected to  strengthen to a 1¾ percent pace, as 
financial conditions in Europe improve. 
Higher utility prices pushed fourth-quarter inflation up to an annual rate of 
4½ percent, a bit more than previously anticipated.  However, w ith energy price inflation 
projected to moderate and core inflation already trending down, inflation should step down to 2 percent in the current quarter.  A mple resource slack, along with our 
assumption of no further increases in the VAT, should keep inflation at an average of about 2 percent  over the remai nder of the forecast period.  W e continue to expect that the 
Bank of England, f aced with a bleak  outlook and adverse financial spillovers from the 
euro area, will increase the target for  its asset purchase program from £275 billion to 
£400 billion during the first half of 2012.

  Canada 
We estimate that real GDP growth in Canada stepped down to an annual rate of 
2 percent in the fourth quarter after a temporary surge in exports helped  boost third-
quarter GDP  growth to 3½ percent.  Monthly real GDP for October was unchanged  from 
the previous month, but the manufacturing PMI edged up in December and points to 
positive, albeit moderate, growth.  W e expect GDP growth to hover around 2 percent 
over the forecast period, a bit lower than in the previous Tealbook, reflecting the 
downward revision to the path of U.S. activity.   
We estimate that headline inflation moved up temporarily to an annual rate of 
3½ percent in the fourth quarter from only 1 percent in the previous quarter, largely 
reflecting the removal of car price discounts announced last summer.  Inflation should 
average 2  percent in 2012 and 1¾ percent in 2013, a touch more than in the December 
Tealbook given the higher path for oil prices.  In view of sizable output gaps and moderating inflation, we continue to expect that the Bank of Canada will keep its main policy rate at 1  percent through the end of 2013.  
EMERGING MARKET  ECONOMIES  
We estimate that real GDP gr owth in the EMEs stepped down to an annual rate of 
3½ percent in the fourth quarter from a 4½ percent pace in the third.  This deceleration reflected a slowdown in both China and Mexico to a more sustainable pace, a weakening of export demand in Asia, and f looding and related supply  chain disruptions in Thailand 
and its trading partners.  We continue to project an acceleration of EME activity in the current quarter, to a pace of 4½ percent, partly reflecting recovery from  the effect  of the 
floods in Thailand.  Growth is then projected to  remain near that rate over the remainder 
of the forecast period, with some strengthening in 2013 as the recovery in the advanced economies gains traction.   
Incoming data suggest that headline inflation moderated to an annual rate of 
3¼ percen t in the fourth quarter ; this decline was somewhat more than anticipated at the 
time of the December Tealbook  and was concentrated  in China, where food prices 
retreated faster than expected.  We continue to project that EME inflation will move down a bit more as the effects of earlier increases in food prices dissipate further.  With concerns about slowing global growth balanced by worries about currency depreciation, 
many EME central banks have kept monetary policy on hold since the December 
Tealbook; a notable exception was the Central Bank of Chile, which, despite 12-month

  inflation moving above its target range in December, loosened policy in response to 
concerns about domestic economic growth.   
China  
Chinese real GDP growth declined from 9½ percent in the third quarter to 
8¼ percent in the fourth, in line with our forecast in the December Tealbook.  Domestic 
demand remained robust, with retail sales and fixed -asset investment continuing to grow 
at close to their third -quarter pace, but the trade surplus fell sharply as imports rose more 
than exports.  For the year as a whole, the trade surplus was $155 billion, down from $182 billion in 2010.  Consumption and gross capital formation each contributed about half of China’s economic growth of 9 percen t in 2011, with net exports exerting a slight 
drag.  Looking forward, w e project that Chinese real GDP will continue to grow at about 
an 8 percent pace this year and next—somewhat below our estimate of potential—with 
domestic demand remaining solid but external demand relatively weak.  This outlook is little changed from the December projection ; we continue to believe that Chinese 
authorities have sufficient scope for policy action to avoid a hard landing should demand slow by more than we currently anticipate.   
Chinese headline consumer price inflation stepped down to 1¾ percent at an 
annual rate in the fourth quarter from 6¼ percent in the third, reflecting a decline in food prices following large increases earlier in the year.  As food prices bottom out, i nflation is 
expected to hover around 3 percent over the next two years.  With inflation beginning to 
moderate, Chinese authorities loosened monetary policy in late November by cutting 
bank reserve requirements, and bank lending accelerated in December.  
Other Emerging Asia 
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, we estimate that growth slowed to a n annual rate of 
only 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter, about 1 percentage point lower than we had 
projected in the December Tealbook.  The slowdown in growth can be primari ly 
attributed to temporary disruptions to regional supply chains resulting from the October floods in Thailand, which caused  domestic output to plunge even more than we had 
projected .  In addition, output in Singapore contracted surprisingly sharply because of  a 
decline in the production of high- tech goods , and external demand was weaker 
throughout the region.  As output in the region recovers from the floods, growth this year should pick up to about 4 percent , a bit lower than previously projected owing to weaker 
exports, and increase to 4½ percent next year as demand from Europe starts to recover.

  Inflation in the region remained at about 3½ percent in the fourth quarter, and we 
expect it to edge down to about 3¼ percent for the remainder of the forecast  period.  
Since the December  Tealbook, mounting concerns over the growth outlook have 
prompted the Reserve Bank of India to refrain from further tightening of monetary policy 
despite persistently high 12-month inflation of about 9 percent.     
Latin America  
We estimate that Mexican real GDP grew at a 3½ percent annual rate in the fourth 
quarter, a large step -down from the previous quarter but ½ percentage point higher than 
projected in the December Tealbook.  Our upward revision reflects better- than-expected 
U.S. industrial production data.  Looking forward, the revised contour of U.S. industrial 
production has led us to increase growth in Mexico in the near term and mark it down 
further out, but these revisions have left average Mexican growth for thi s year and next 
about unchanged from the December Tealbook at about 3 percent.  
On balance, g rowth in South America is estimated to have remained steady at an 
annual rate of 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter.  Incoming data suggest that Brazil’s economy, which stalled in the third quarter, perked up a bit in the fourth, in line with our expectations.  However, this improvement has been offset by a deceleration of activity elsewhere in South America.  Our outlook for the region is little changed from the December Tealbook, with growth rising to about 3½ percent by next year, as monetary 
policy easing supports Brazil’s recovery and the global economy strengthens .     
Recent data suggest that headline inflation in Latin America increased to an 
annual rate of 5½ percent in the fourth quarter from 3½ percent in the third, in part because of a weather -related rise in food prices and the removal of an electricity subsidy 
in Mexico.  We expect these effect s to dissipate going forward, which should bring 
inflation for the region back down to about 3¾ percent by midyear.  Of note, Brazilian 
inflation has fallen to the upper bound of 6½ percent of the central bank’s target range, 
giving authorities some scope to loosen monetary policy further.

Financial Developments  
Conditions in financial markets  improved some what  over the intermeeting period, 
with stock prices higher, risk spreads in several markets narrower, and measures of actual 
and implied volatility generally down.  Nonetheless, with doubts persist ing about the 
prospects for a durable solution to the European fiscal and banking problems, the 
European situation continued to be a central co ncern for investors .  Term Libor –OIS 
spreads remained elevated , with dollar f unding pressures  especially notable for European 
banks.  
On balance over the period, policy expectations edged down, longer- dated 
Treasury yields declined , and inflation compensation was relatively little  changed .  
Meanwhile, f inancing  conditions for large nonfinancial businesses generally remained 
favorable , as net debt financing was strong and C&I l ending continued to expand in 
December .  Credit conditions for households were  mixed.   Consumer credit increased  
robustly in November, but mortgage refinancing activity remain ed subdued amid tight 
lending conditions despite mortgage rates that hovered near record -low levels.    
Portfolio -weighted responses to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on 
Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated that, in the aggregate, loan demand 
strengthened slightly and lending standards eased a bit further in the fourth quarter (see 
appendix). 
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 
FOMC communications during the period  were largely in line with market 
expectations and had limited effect s on financial market s.  That said,  investors were 
somewhat  surprised by the announcement that the Summary of Economic Projections to 
be published with the minutes of the January FOMC  meeting  will include FOMC 
participants ’ projections of the path of the federal funds rate as well as their qualitative 
expectations for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet .  
Over the intermeeting period, t he date at which the expected federal funds rate 
implied by OIS rates first rises above its current 0 to ¼ percent  target range moved out 
one quarter to the first quarter of 2014, and the mean path of the policy rate for 2014 and

  beyond dec reased  6 to 26 basis points.1  The mo dal path of expected policy rates derived 
from quotes on interest rate caps remained within the current target range through the end 
of 2015.   
Results from the Open Market Desk’s latest survey of primary dealers also 
suggested that the respondents had pushed back slightly the expected timing of 
tightening .  Respondents viewed the third quarter of 2014 as the most likely time for 
liftoff of the federal funds rate , one quarter later than indicated in the December survey .  
In response to questions about possible options for easing, dealers assigned a 70 percent 
probability to the Committee making changes to its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate at the January meeting  and a 40 percent probability to  the Committee 
providing guidance on the size of the SOMA portfolio.  M any dealers  indicated that they 
expected the “mid -2013” reference in the FOMC’s statement to be updated or removed 
given the publication of FOMC meeting participants’ federal funds rate projections in the Summary of Economic Projections.  Dealers modestly revised down, from 60 percent to 55 percent, the likelihood assigned to an expansion of the SOMA portfolio through securities purchases within one year.    
The decline in the expected path for the federal funds rate was reflected in 
Treasury yields , which fell  over the intermeeting period, particularly at intermediate and 
longer maturities .  Staff term -structure models suggest that a narrowing in term premi ums 
also contributed to the move in Treasury yields, consistent with the reduct ion in long-
term interest rate implied volatilities over the period.  TIPS - and  swaps -based  measures 
of inflation compensation were relatively little changed , on net , despite an appreciable 
rise in energy  prices.   
The Desk’s outright purchases and sales of Treasury securities under the m aturity 
extension program continued to be generally well received and did not appear to have any 
adverse effect  on Treasury market  functioning.
2  Trading volumes were thin in 
December , as is typical at t hat time of the year , but other measures of Treasury market 
liquidity remained stable.  
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 7 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging 5¼ basis points.  
2 As of January 17, 2012, the Desk had sold $162 billion of short -term Treasury securities and 
purchased $149 billion of long- term securities under the maturity extension program.

  SHORT-TERM DOLLAR FUNDING MARKETS  AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  
 U.S. financial institutions  reportedly maintained ready access to short -term 
funding m arkets , and there were few signs of dislocations in funding markets over  
year-end.  European banks continued to face dollar funding pressures, and spreads 
between Libor and OIS rates remained elevated; on net over the period, the three-month 
Libor–OIS spread widened a touch further while spreads at shorter maturities were little 
changed .  The spread between the forward  rate agreement three to six months ahead and 
the corresponding forw ard OIS rate remained at a relatively high level but narrowed 
somewhat, a change that perhaps reflected an  expectation for some moderation of these 
pressures .  
U.S. financial institutions generally continued to issue commercial paper (CP) and 
negotiable ce rtificate s of deposit on terms typical of noncrisis periods.  Outstanding 
unsecured CP  issued in the U nited States  by entities with European parents declined 
somewhat  further, but the fraction of issuance by European entities occurring beyond 
very short- term maturities  moved up a bit .  Overnight spreads for unsecured CP  issued by 
entities with French parents declined substantially  following the reduction in the cost of 
dollar liquidity provided through central bank swap lines with the Federal Reserve,  the 
implementation  of the ECB’s three -year l onger -term r efinancing operation (LTRO) , and 
the passage of year -end.  Meanwhile, spreads for issuers with parents fr om elsewhere in 
Europe or the United States remained comparatively low.  
The general collateral repo market has continued to function normally, with no 
reports of unusual year -end pressures , and haircuts across collateral types appeared to be 
largely unchanged.  Volume in the triparty repo market declined somewhat around  year-end but revived in the first two weeks of 2012, buoyed by a pickup in the financing 
of Treasury securities.  Spreads on overnight asset- backed commercial paper (ABCP) 
issued by entities with French parents stabilized at a high level, while sp reads on 
overnight ABCP  issued by firms with parents from elsewhere in Europe or the United 
States  were stable at a low level .  
Other indicators provided mixed evidence of strains in the financial system.  
Equity prices of most large domestic financial institutions outperformed the broader market, on net, over the intermeeting period.  The initial wave of f ourth- quarter earnings 
reports for large bank  holding companies were mixed relative to market expectations, 
with poor capital market revenues weighing on the profi ts of institutions with significant

  trading operations.  The CDS spreads of most domestic large bank holding companies 
moved notably lower, although they remained at an  elevated level.  (See the box “Recent 
Developments in Counterparty Risk Management.”)  Hedge fund valuations declined 
again  during the intermeeting period .  Overall for  2011, the HFR X Global Hedge Fund 
Index underperformed the S&P 500 stock index by about 8½ percent, though, on average, there were  no signs of significant outflows from hedge funds. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
During the intermeeting period, international financial markets were calmer than 
in previous months, as the financial pressures faced by most European sovereigns and financial institutions declined somewhat in the wake of ECB policy actions and in the absence of negative policy news coming out of Europe.  However, doubts remained  about 
the prospects for a durable solution to the European situation.  Indeed, late in the period, difficulties resurfaced in the negotiations over Greek restructuring, and S&P downgraded the sovereign credit ratings of several euro -area nations.  
The ECB’s  three- year LTRO , announced a few days before the December FOMC 
meeting and implemented in mid -December, contributed to an  easing of euro funding 
pressures , and overnight interbank euro interest rates declined from about 70 basis points 
to about 40 basis points following the LTRO.  Euro- area institutions drew almost  
€500 billion in three-year funds while reducing their demand for ECB funding at shorter maturities.   On net, the total provision of liquidity by the ECB increased about 
€200 billion.  On January 4, the ECB allocated $26 billion in its second offering of  three-month dollar funding since the reduction in  the cost of dollar liquidity fro m central 
bank swap lines announced in late November.  As of January 17, the ECB was providing dollar liquidity amounting to a bit more than $80 billion, up from almost $55 billion at the time of the December  FOMC meeting .  One gauge of dollar funding pressures in the 
euro area, the three -month euro–dollar implied basis spread , dropped about 50 basis 
points over the period; it is now 75 basis points lower than its level prior to the late November swap line announcement, but it remains elevated.  
Spreads of yields on 10- year Italian government debt over those on German bunds 
were little changed over the intermeeting period , and spreads on Spanish debt declined 
40 basis points.  Spreads o n 2-year Italian and Spanish debt declined roughly 150 basis 
points, and both Italy and Spain held successful debt auctions.  Although the reasons for

 Recent Developments  in Counterparty  Risk Management  
During the past several months,  market participants  have become more 
concerned  about the counterparty  credit risks posed  by financial institutions.   For 
instance,  in the two most  recent Senior Credit Officer Opinion Surveys on  Dealer 
Financing  Terms (SCOOS),  dealers indicated  that they had increased  the 
resources  and attention  devoted to management  of concentrat ed exposures  to 
dealers and other financial intermediaries  over the  previous  three months  (see 
lower‐ left figure below).   Additionally,  in the December  SCOOS, most credit 
officers reported  that their institutions  had decreased  counterparty  credit limits 
for specific  institutions;  they generally  pointed to a deterioration in  the current  or 
expected  financial strength of other insti tutions and to increased  strains in global 
financial markets as the most important  reasons for having  done so. 
Conversations  with market  participants  have provided  additional  information  on 
the specific practices  used to monitor  exposures  to financial  institutions.   
Participants  report monitoring  indicators  of counterparty  risk across  a range of 
distinct business  areas—such as  OTC derivatives markets, secured  funding 
markets, and  prime brokerage activities—but  the procedures  employed  to 
evaluate the overall counterparty  risk of other firms vary considerably.   Most 
market participants  report paying close attention  to CDS spreads of their 
counterparties.  Some  institutions  indicated  that spreads of  500 to 600  basis 
points are triggers for mor e active management  of exposures,  for example  
through heightened  scrutiny of new trades and more frequent valuation  of 
positions.   Market participants  also report gauging the counterparty  credit risk 
posed by a financial  institution  based on equity prices or measures  of implied 
volatility in the equity  options market.  Industry  contacts  also sugge st that 
perceptions  of counterparty  credit risk are quite sensitive  to reports that  other 
firms are not willing to accept  novation  of OTC trades from the institution  in 
question or that others are seeking to novate trades  away from that institution.

In addition to carefully  tracking the counterparty  credit exposures  they 
themselves  face, major financial intermediaries—keenly  aware of the speed with 
which confidence  can diminish—have also  reportedly  stepped up their 
monitoring  of requests  from their own counterparties  to close out positions,  
transfer margin collateral  to third parties, and other indicators  that would 
suggest heightened  conce rns regarding  their own financial  condition.  
When implementing  monetary  policy, the Federal Reserve  trades Treasury  and 
agency securities  with designated  primary dealers, a group of broker–dealers 
that includes but is not limited to affiliates  of major banks and securities  firms 
and involves institutions  with a range of  credit ratings (see lower‐ right figure  on 
the facing page).  In recent months, the Federal Reserve  has instituted  new 
procedures  to limit counterparty  credit risk in its trading with primary  dealers.  In 
particular,  the Federal Reserve  established  margin agreements  with primary 
dealers on agency MBS forward transactions.   These transactions  typically settle 
one or more months forward,  and thus fluctuations  over that period in the 
market value of the securities  purchased  could impose costs on the Federal 
Reserve if a transaction  needed to be replaced  following  the failure of a 
counterparty.   In an effort  to protect against these price  fluctuations,  the Federal 
Reserve now requires dealers to post an initial margin of 2.5 percent  on agency 
MBS forward  transactions;  additional  margins are required  to be posted or 
margin is returned  based on daily changes in market values.  The margin  
requirements  are one‐sided—that is, th e Federal Reserve  is not required  to 
provide collateral  in the event that market prices move in the dealers’ favor by 
more than the initial  margin.  Margins  were set to cover potential  price 
movements  over a three‐day  expected  replacement period  with a very high  
degree of confidence.   Margin requirements  were initially imposed  on MF Global 
as that firm’s financial heal th worsened  but were  subsequently  extended  to all 
primary dealers.1 
                                                 
1 Market values had moved so that the cost to the Federal  Reserve to replace the 
transactions  outstanding  with MF Global when it defaulted  was higher than the original price 
of the transactions.   However,  the margin posted by MF Global was sufficient  to cover this cost 
difference.

  the declines in spreads are not entirely clear, some market participants attributed them  to 
the possible use of LTRO funds by banks to purchase shorter-term peripheral debt.   
On January 13, S&P lowered the long-term ratings of nine euro- area countries.  
France and Austria were downgraded one notch to AA+, and Italy and Spain each 
received a two -notch downgrade.  Following the sovereign actions, S&P downgraded the 
European Financia l Stability Facility rating one notch to AA+.  Overall market reaction 
to the ratings announcements was muted.  Similarly, markets shrugged off news that 
negotiations over the terms of a voluntary private- sector debt exchange for Greece were 
temporarily suspended.  
The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar changed little, on net, 
over the intermeeting period.  However, while the dollar depreciated some against most 
other currencies, it appreciated 3 ½ percent against the euro, likely owing in part to the 
deteriorating macroeconomic environment in the euro area and consequent market 
expectations for further easing of monetary policy by the ECB . 
Foreign stock markets generally ended the period higher.  European headline 
equity indexes rose 6½ percent, on net, and euro- area banking -sector share prices were 
little changed overall.  However, shares of Italian bank UniCredit were down by about 40 percent  over the period.  This  somewhat surprising decline followed the release of the 
terms of a previously announced rights offering and prompted concerns that other  euro-area banks may be discouraged from seeking to raise further capital in the equity 
market.  
Emerging  market equity and bond funds continued to experience outflows, 
although the pace of s uch flows slowed in January.  R ating  agencies cut Hungary’s 
sovereign debt rating to junk status, and Hungarian asset prices came under pressure.   
Foreign private-investor demand for U.S. Treasury securities picked up notably in 
November, consistent with the general decrease in risk appetite at that time.  Official inflows were also sizable, as foreign exchange intervention activity boosted official purchases of Treasury securities.  Partial and confidential data on custody accounts at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York show a sharp decline in official holdings in 
December.  Although some of this decline seems to reflect actual sales, it also appears 
that some official investors are shifting Treasury holdings to foreign custodians, and those holdings are not captured in either the TIC or the FRBNY data.

  DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad equity price indexes increased more than 4½  percent , on net, over the 
intermeeting period, reflecting  in part somewhat better -than-expected U.S. economic data 
releases  and some easing in concerns about Europe.  Option- implied volatility on the 
S&P 500 index declined to its lowest levels since July  but remained well above its range 
in the first half of 2011.  The staff’s estimate of the spread between the expected real 
equity return for the S&P 500 index and the real 10- year Treasury yield —a gauge of the 
equity premium—remained extraordinarily wide.  
Operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms increased 8 percent in the third 
quarter , reflecting in part transitory gains for financial firms .  Over the intermeeting 
period, bottom- up Wall Street forecasts for earnings in the fourth quarter fell a bit and 
now point to a small decline from third -quarter levels .  An index of revisions to analysts’ 
forecasts of year -ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms, which registered notable negative 
values starting last August, eased some for the four -week period ending in  
mid-December . 
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds declined  a bit more than  those on 
comparable -maturity Treasury securities.  Yields  on speculative-grade corporate bonds 
and their spreads to yields on Treasury securities decreased noticeably .  Conditions in the 
secondary leveraged loan market were  stable , with median bid prices about unchanged.  
On net, spreads of yields on A2/P2 -rated  unsecured CP issued by nonfinancial firms over 
yields on A1/P1- rated issues were about flat . 
BUSINESS FINANCE 
Net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations was solid overall in December.  
Bond is suance by investment-grade nonfinancial corporations was  strong, though below 
its outsized November pace , while that by  lower -rated firms slowed, likely owing  in part 
to seasonal factors .  Nonfinancial CP  outstanding contracted some what  amid moderate 
year-end pressures, and  C&I loans posted solid growth.  I ssuance of leveraged loans was 
relatively modest in the fourth quarter compared with its robust pace earlier in the year . 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms continued to rebound in 
December from a slow third -quarter pace, boosted by previously withdrawn IPOs that 
were brought to market.  Share repurchases and cash -financed mergers by nonfinancial

  firms maintained their recent strength in the third quarter, leaving net equity issuance 
deeply negative.  Preliminary data on merger activity and announcements of new share 
repurchase programs suggest that net equity issuance likely remained  quite negative in 
the fourth quarter. 
Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to be solid.  
The aggregate ratio of debt to assets remained  low in the third quarter, and the liquid 
asset ratio was near its highest level in more than 20 years.  The volume of corporate 
bonds of nonfinancial companies upgraded by Moody’s Investor Service in the  fourth quarter continued to substantially outpace the volume of those downgraded.  American Airlines filed for bankruptcy in November, which pushed up a bi t the  
six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancia l firms ; nonetheless, the rate remained 
fairly low overall.  The expected year -ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms from the 
Moody’s KMV model ticked down in December, reflecting lower stock price volatility and higher asset valuation s. 
Financing conditions for c ommercial real estate remained tight.  Issuance of 
commercial mortgage -backed securities (CMBS) remained subdued in the fourth quarter, 
a pace expected to per sist in 2012.  CMBS spreads over swaps declined  over the 
intermeeting period, in line with the decreases  seen for other higher- risk fixed -income 
securities.  Responses to the January SLOOS indicate that bank CRE lending standards remain ex traordinarily tight, but compared with  one year ago , some banks reported 
having reduced the spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for the first time since 2007.  Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages stayed elevated , and commercial real 
estate price indexes continued to fluctuate around levels substantially  lower than their 
2007 peaks. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE 
Conditions in mortgage markets remained extremely tight.  Although mortgage 
interest rates and yields on current -coupon agency MBS edged down further to  near  their 
historic al lows, mortgage refinancing activity stayed subdued, as tight underwriting and 
low levels of home equity continued to limit the access of many households to the mortgage market.   Moreover, m ortgage delinquenc y rates , while improving gradually , 
remained elevated relative to pre -crisis norms.

  House prices continued to move lower.  The November reading of the CoreLogic 
repeat -sales house price index was more than  4 per cent below its year-ago level .  
Although the decreases in home prices have been larger in recent months than during the 
summer, some of the declines likely reflect a seasonal  increase in the share of distressed 
sales .   
The price of subprime residential mortgage -backed securities ( RMBS ), as 
measured by the ABX index,  rose over the intermeeting period, in line with the changes 
for other higher- risk fixed -income securities.  The market remains somewhat illiquid, as 
demonstrated by a temporary drop in the ABX index after rumors surfaced ab out the 
possible sale of the subprime RMBS in the Maiden Lane II portfolio.  The new- issue 
market for subprime RMBS remains closed, and non- agency issuance is limited to the 
occasional securitization of small portfolios of high-quality jumbo mortgages. 
On the whole, conditions in consumer credit markets showed signs of 
improvement.  Consumer credit increased  robustly in November, while delinquency rates 
on credit card loans in securitized pools held steady in November at the lowest levels seen in the 20- year history of the series. Lending standards on consumer loans continued 
to ease modestly, as evidenced both from Mintel data on credit card offers and from responses to the January SLOOS.  Issuance of consumer ABS in the fourth quarter held steady at the mo derate levels observed throughout 2011. 
GOVERNMENT FINANCE 
During the intermeeting period, the Treasury Department auctioned about 
$199 billion of nominal coupon securities across the maturity spectrum and $12 billion of five-year TIPS.  The auctions  were generally well received .  On January 4, 2012, the 
Treasury began using its currently available accounting tools to avoid breaching the $15.194 trillion debt subject to limit.  The s taff estimates that these tools will allow the 
Treasury to remain under the debt ceiling while the President and the Congress complete 
the procedural steps required to raise the borrowing limit.
3
Financing conditions for state and local governments were again mixed.  Gross 
long-term issuance of municipal bonds remained robust in December, with continued  
                                                 
3 The President formally requested an increase of $1.2 trillion in the statutory debt limit in  
mid-January, and the request is expected to be approved based on the budget agreements reached last 
August.

  strength in new capital issuances.  CDS spreads for states inched down further over the 
intermeeting period.  Yields on long- term general obligation municipal bonds fell 
notably, leaving the yield ratio at  about 1.3.  However, downgrades of municipal bonds 
continued to substantially outpace upgrades in the third quarter, and higher- frequency 
data on ratings changes suggest that this pattern  may have been even more pronounced in  
the fourth quarter.   
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY 
In the fourth quarter, bank credit continued to increase, as banks accumulated 
agency MBS and the growth of total loans picked up.  Core loans—the sum of C&I loans, 
real estate loans , and consumer loans—e xpanded modestly.  Growth of C& I loans at 
domestic banks was  robust but was partly offset by weak ness at European institutions.  
Despite  their steady growth in 2011, C&I loans have so far offset only about 30 percent 
of the steep declines posted between late 2008 and mid-2010.  Home  equity loans fell 
further in the fourth quarter , and commercial  real estate loans contracted for the 12th 
consecutive quarter, though the pace of contraction  appeared  to slow somewhat in 
November and December.   Noncore loans—a category that includes lending to nonbank 
financial institutions —rose sharply, on net, in the fourth quarter, reflecting in part a surge  
in such loans at U.S. branches and agencies of European banks. 
Portfolio -weighted responses to the January SLOOS indicated that, in the 
aggregate, loan demand strengthened slightly and lending standards eased a bit  further in 
the fourth quarter.  In particular, notable fractions of domestic banks reported stronger 
demand for C&I loans f rom firms of all sizes , and the net fraction of banks reporting 
increased demand from small firms rose to its highest level since 2005.  Domestic banks reported unchanged standards on C&I loans over the fourth quarter, but significant net fractions  continued to report reduced pricing on these loans on net .  Branches  and 
agencies of foreign banks reported having tightened both standards and terms on  C&I loans.  Moderate fractions of both domestic and foreign banks again reported having tightened standards on loans to nonfinancial firms with significant exposure to Europe.  
(See the box “Dollar Funding Strains and Credit Provision of U.S. Branches and 
Agencies of European Banks.”)  Many domestic banks also reported an increase in business as a result of a decr ease in competition from European banks.  Moreover, 
SLOOS responses indicated that l arge fractions of domestic banks expected that over the 
next 12 months, credit quality in most major loan categories  would improve.

 Dollar Funding Strains and Credit Provision  of  
U.S. Branches  and Agencies  of European  Banks 
The U.S. branches  and agencies  of European  banks (hereafter,  European  branches) currently  
account for about  10 percent  of total commercial  bank assets in the United States.1  Thus, pressures  
on such firms caused  by the ongoing fiscal and banking problems  in Europe could have noticeable  
effects on lending in the United States.  Indeed, the  composition  of the balance  sheets of European  
branches  has changed  markedly since the strains  in short‐term  unsecured  dollar funding  markets 
intensified  in mid‐2011.   
Since mid‐ 2011, European  branches  have changed the structure of  their funding—their  holdings  of 
large‐denomination  time deposits  have dropped  steadily, and  they have shifted from being a net 
supplier of dollars to their  related offices to being net receivers  of such funds  (see lower‐ left 
figure).  Other funding sources have also become less available  to European  branches;  for example,  
respondents  to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey  on Bank Lending Practices  (SLOOS)  
reported  widespread  tightening  of standards  on loans to European  banks or their affiliates  and 
subsidiaries  over the second half of the year (see appendix).   Moreover,  some European  branches  
have run down  their cash assets significantly.   These recent patterns  have primarily  reflected  
developments  at the U.S.  branches  of French banks, which reportedly  have faced substantial  
funding pressures  since mid‐ 2011.2   
The funding strains also appear to have resulted in some reduction  in the provision  of credit to U.S. 
firms by most European  branches.3  C&I loans held by these branches  have declined  noticeably  
since the middle  of last year even  as the overall demand for such loans, as  reported  in the SLOOS, 
has reportedly  increased  (see lower‐ right figure).       
           
  
 
                                                 
1 The nearly 40 European  branches  on the Federal  Reserve’s  weekly reporting  panel account for more than 
90 percent of such branches’  assets. 
2 The U.S. branches  of Spanish and Italian banks generally  have been shrinking  since early 2010, but these 
institutions  are quite  small relative to the French and the non‐French European  branches.  
3 U.S. branches  and agencies of foreign banks  generally  do not provide credit to U.S. households.

In addition,  a significant  fraction of European  branches  reportedly  tightened  standards  and terms 
on C&I loans  during the second half of last year, whereas  domestic banks  generally  eased some of 
their lending policies on such loans  on net.  Moreover,  because a tightening  of standards  and terms 
tends to be  reflected  with a lag  in the stock of loans outstanding,  the SLOOS results suggest that a 
further contraction  in the C&I loans  of European  branches  may be likely.   
In contrast,  lending by European  branches  to nonbank  financial institutions  has surged over the  
second half of the year.  However, the  increase is due entirely to reverse  repurchase agreements  by 
a couple of  French branches  that have reportedly  provided  substantial  funding to their affiliated  
U.S. broker–dealers.  Indeed, such loans  at the non ‐French European  branches  have declined  over 
the same period. 
On the whole, it appears that the changes in credit flows to the U.S. economy  from European  
branches  have not  yet begun to restrain  the provision  of credit to U.S. firms; to the  contrary,  the 
available data indicate that other institutions  have stepped in to provide  credit directly to U.S. 
businesses.   After expanding  at an 8 percent average annual rate over the first half of last year, 
total C&I loans  grew 11 percent over the  second half of the year, as a pickup in C&I  lending by 
domestic institutions  and non‐European  branches  more than offset  the declines at the European  
branches.   Indeed, many  domestic  respondents  to the latest SLOOS  reported  an “increase  in 
business”  over the past six months  as a result of reduced competition  from European  banks. 
Going forward,  however,  the European  parent institutions  have strong incentives  to shrink  their 
balance sheets  and other credit exposures.   In addition to ongoing  funding strains, they face 
enhanced  capital and liquidity requirements  and pressure  from domestic  supervisors  to pull back  
from foreign markets.4  According  to press reports and the edit explanations  received  with our  
weekly bank balance sheet  data, some European  banks have sold securities  and other U.S. assets, 
including  loans, but the  quantities  do not appear to have been substantial,  at least thus far.  In 
addition, available  data on off‐balance‐ sheet  exposures  indicate that European  branches  had about 
$110 billion  of outstanding  standby letters of credit to U.S. addressees and  about $360 billion of 
unused commitments  to fund loans at the end of the third quarter, quantities  that already stand 
well below  their pre‐crisis levels.  Furthermore,  some European  financial institutions  have large 
securities  and trading operations  in the United States; as  marketmakers and  providers of  liquidity, 
these institutions  are instrumental  to intermediation  activities,  and their withdrawal  from these 
activities could have important  consequences  for various  forms of credit extension  and financial 
market liquidity.      
                                                 
4 European  parent institutions  reportedly  face pressure regarding  early implementation  of 
Basel III requirements,  and the European  Banking Authority  (EBA)  announced  that 71 large European  banks  must 
meet a temporary  9 percent core Tier 1 capital ratio requirement  by the end of June 2012.  By itself,  the EBA’s 
estimated  capital shortfall for core European  banks―about  €31 billion―is deemed to be manageable.

  M2 increased at an annual rate of 5¼ percent in December .4  The  level  of M2 
remained elevated relative to the staff’s assessment of  fundamentals, likely reflecting  
investors’ desire to hold safe and liquid assets in the face of  the European crisis.  In 
addition, demand deposits surged around year -end, reportedly as lenders in repo and 
other short-term funding markets chose to leave substantial balances with banks over the 
turn of the year.  The monetary base—reserve balances and currency —increased  in 
December  along with currency.  Reserve balances were roughly unchanged over the 
period; a decline in reserve balances resulting from an increase in balances in the Treasury’s general accoun t offset the boost to reserve levels associated with  the increased 
drawings  of foreign central banks on the dollar liquidity swap lines .  (See the box 
“Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period.”)  
 
                                                 
4 The staff recently revised measures of the money stock and its components to incorporate 
updated seasonal factors and a new quarterly benchmark.  The revisions increased the growth rate of M2 by 
about 1 percentage point in the first half of 2011 and lowered the growth rate by 1 ¾ percentage point in the 
second half.

 Balance Sheet Developments  over the Intermeeting  Period 
Over the intermeeting  period, total assets of the Federal Reserve increased  
$19 billion to $2,924 billion (see the table on the facing page).  
Since the December  FOMC meeting,  the Open Market Desk  conducted  
19 operations  as part of the maturity  extension  program:   the Desk purchased  
$40 billion  in Treasury  securities  with remaining  maturities  of 6 to 30 years and 
sold $62 billion in Treasury  securities  with maturities  of 3 years or less.1  In 
addition, the Desk purchased  $33 billion in agency MBS securities  as part of the 
policy of reinvesting  principal  payments  from agency debt and agency MBS.  
Because of agency MBS market conventions,  settlements  of these  transactions  
can occur  well after trade execution.    
Foreign central  bank liquidity swaps increased  $49 billion  to $103 bil lion, primarily  
reflecting  large 84‐day draws by  the European  Central Bank  and the Bank  of 
Japan.  The net portfolio holdings  of Maiden Lane LLC  declined  $3 billion largely 
reflecting  ongoing asset sales, while holdings  of the Maiden Lane  II and Maiden 
Lane III LLCs were nearly unchanged.   Loans outstan ding under the Term Asset‐
Backed Securities  Loan Facility  declined  about $1 billion to $9 billion. 
On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet,  the Treasury’s  
General Account increased  $33 billion, and Federal Reserve  notes in circulation  
increased  $4 billion.  Reserve  balances  of depository  institutions  increased  
$8 billion over the period while other deposits decreased  $17 billion,  reflecting  a 
decline of relatively  high GSE balances  that had been  accumulated  prior to the  
payment of  principal  and interest on agency MBS last month.  Term deposits  held 
by depository  institutions  declined  by $2 billion as a $5 billion small‐ value 
operation  of the Term Deposit Facility matured  on December  15, 2011, and  a 
smaller $3  billion operation  was conducted  on January 9, 2012.  The auction  size 
for these small‐ value operations  was reduced in light of relatively  low bid‐to‐

 Appendix   
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
Overall, i n the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, 
modest net fractions of domestic banks reported ly eased their lending standards and experienced 
stronger  demand over the past three months.1  Howe ver, econometric analysis shows that the 
amount of easing reported in the January survey was  more than would have been expected once a 
number of bank- specific factors and the evolution of several key macroeconomic variables over 
the survey period  are taken into account.  Meanwhile , foreign respondents, which mainly lend to 
businesses, reported a net tightening o f their lending standards.2
Regar ding business loans, domestic banks reported, on balance, little change in standards 
on commercial and industrial ( C&I) loans but a continued easing of pricing terms  on those loans 
during the fourth quarter .  Consistent with strong growth in C&I loans in recent months, domestic 
banks reportedly experienced stronger demand for C&I loans from firms of all sizes on net.  The 
net fraction of banks reporting increased demand from small firms rose to its highest level since 
2005.3  Many domestic banks also reported an increase in business as a result of reduced 
competition from European banks (or their branches and  subsidiaries).  Indeed, f oreign 
respondents reported having tighten ed both standards and terms on C&I loans, on net , and they  
noted that loan demand  had been about unchanged over the past three months.  Domestic banks 
continued to report little change in their standards for  commercial real estate ( CRE ) loans , but 
modest net fractions had eased some loan terms over the past year.  As has been the case recently, moderate net fractions of domestic banks reported that demand for CRE loans had strengthened .    
In response to a set of special questions that were also asked in the October 2011 survey, 
large  fractions of both domestic and fore ign respondents again reported ly tighten ed standards on 
loans to European banks or their branches and subsidiaries  during the fourth quarter.  In addition, 
moderate fractions of banks indicated that they tightened standards and terms on loans to 
nonfinanci al firms  with significant exposure to Europe.   
                                                 
1 The January 2012 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to 
businesses and households over the past three months.  This appendix is based on responses from  
56 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Respondent banks received the 
survey on or after December 21, 2011, and responses were due by January 10, 2012.  
2 For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction 
of banks that reported having tightened standa rds minus the fraction of banks that reported having eased 
standards.  For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fractions of banks that 
reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand.  
3 Large and middle -market firms  are generally defined as firms with annual sales of $50 million or 
more and small firms  as those with annual sales of less than $50 million.

  On the household side, lending standards and demand for loans to purchase residential 
real estate were  reportedly little changed  over the fourth quarter  on net.  Standards on home 
equity lines of credit (HELOCs) were about unchanged, while demand for such loans continued 
to weaken on net.  On a loan-weighted basis, however, standards on both purchase loans and 
HELOCs have eased modestly in each of the past several surveys.4  Moderate net fractions of 
banks reported that they had eased  standards on all types of consumer loans over the past three 
months, and some  banks also eased terms on auto loans .  Demand for credit card and auto loans 
reportedly increased somewhat, while demand for other types of consumer loans was about unchanged. 
In response to a set of special questions regarding respondents’ outlook for asset quality  
in 2012, moderate net fractions of domestic banks reportedly expect that  ongoing improvements 
in credit quality will continue this year  in most major loan categories.   
LENDING TO BUSINESS ES 
Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending  
Domestic banks reported that their credit standards on C&I loans to firms of all sizes 
were little changed over  the fourth quarter on net.  However, U.S. branches and agencies of 
foreign banks reported ly tighten ed their standards  on C&I loans for the second consecutive 
quarter, on balance.  The tightening by foreign survey respondents was again primarily limited to  
U.S. branches and agencies of European banks. 
A large net fraction of domestic banks eased many terms on C&I loans to firms of all 
sizes.  Spreads and costs of credit lines for large firms were trimmed  by a somewhat larger 
fraction of banks than in the pr evious survey.  A moderate net fraction of banks also indicated a 
reduc tion in  their use of interest rate floors.   In addition, s everal large banks eased loan covenants 
to large and middle- market firms , a change that is consistent with reports of more -accommodative 
lending conditions in the syndicated loan market in recent months.  
Domestic banks that reported having eased terms on C&I loans unanimously cited 
increased competition from other banks and nonbank lenders as a reason for having done so, with  
only about a quarter of those banks attributing the change to  an improved or less uncertain 
economic outlook.  The handful of banks that reported having tightened at least one C&I loan 
term primarily cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook and increased concerns 
about legislative, supervisory, or accounting policies. 
Meanwhile, foreign survey respondents continued to tighten terms on C&I loans, on net, 
primarily reflecting actions taken by those with European parents .  Almost half of the European 
respondents and only a quarter of the  non-European foreign respondents reduced the maximum 
size of credit lines.  European respondents were also more likely  than other branches and agencies 
                                                 
4 Responses are weighted by survey respondents’ holdings of the relevant loan type, as repor ted in 
the September 30, 2011, Call Report.

  in the survey to have reduced the maximum maturity of  C&I  loans and to have increase d the cost 
of such credit lines.   Foreign respondents that reported having tightened  their standards or  terms  
on C&I loans unanimously cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook.  Notably, 
about one-third of the European respondents that had tightened at least one term over the past 
three months cited concerns about their capital position while none of the non-European foreign respondents that had tightened cited this reason.  Liquidity concerns were cited as a reason for 
tightening standards or terms on C&I loans by about one-third of both the European and  
non-European foreign respondents.  
Reports from domestic banks of stronger demand for C&I loans outnumbered reports of 
weaker deman 
d, in contrast to the net weakening of demand reported in the previous survey.  
Moreover, about 15 percent of domestic banks, on net, reported increased demand from small firms, the largest net percentage that has been reported since 2005.  Similarly, domestic banks 
reported a net inc rease in the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers regarding 
new or increased credit lines.  Domestic banks that saw weaker demand and those that saw 
stronger demand both cited changes in customers’ funding needs related to inventories, acc ounts 
receivable, and mergers and acquisitions as important factors underlying the change in demand.  Of domestic banks reporting weaker demand, about 85 percent cited reduced funding needs for 
capital investment.  Foreign respondents experienced little change, on net, in demand for C&I 
loans.   
Special Questions on Lending to Firms with European Exposures  
A set of special questions in the January survey asked respondents about lending to banks 
headquartered in Europe and their affilia tes and subsidiaries (regardless of the location of the 
affiliates and subsidiaries) as well as to nonfinancial firms that have operations in the United 
States and  significant exposures to European economies (regardless of the location of the firms).  
Thes e questions were also asked in the previous survey, conducted in October 2011.  
Large fractions of domestic and foreign respondents again reported having tightened 
standards on loans to European banks, and one respondent volunteered that they had also tightened standards on loans to nonbank financial firms headquartered in Europe .  There was also 
more widespread tightening of standards than in the previous survey on loans to nonfinancial firms that have operations in the United States and  significant exposure to European economies.  
No domestic or foreign respondent reported that it had eased standards to either type of firm .  
Demand for credit was reportedly little changed , on net , from European banks (or their affiliates 
and subsidiaries) and from nonfinancial firms with significant European exposure . 
A new special question asked if domestic respondents had experienced an increase in 
business o
ver the past six months as a result of decreased competition from European banks  
(or their affiliates and subsidiaries).  About half of the respondents who reported competing with 
European banks for business noted such an increase in business.   One large domestic bank 
specifically reported that business increased slightly in the syndicat ed loan market because some 
European banks have withdrawn from such lending activity to conserve capital.

  Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending 
Domestic b anks continued to report little change in their standards on CRE loans, which 
were widely described in a special question in the July survey (two quarters ago) as being at or 
near their tightest levels since 2005.   A moderate net fraction of foreign survey  respondents 
reportedly tightened their standards on such loans.  
As has been the case recently, moderate fractions of domestic banks reported that demand 
for CRE loans  had strengthened , on net, over the past three months.  In contrast, the foreign 
responde nts reported that demand for CRE loans had remained little changed  over that period.  
Overall, t his net strengthening in demand is roughly consistent with an apparent slowing in the 
pace of runoff of CRE loans at banks during November and December, although  most other 
indicators of activity in markets  to finance CRE remain depressed .  
Annual Question on Commercial Real Estate Loan Terms  
The January survey also included a question regarding changes in terms on CRE loans 
over the past year (repeated an nually since 2001) .  During the past 12 months, on net, some 
domestic banks reportedly eased maximum  CRE  loan sizes and many domestic banks eased  loan 
spreads.  Furthermore, a  few l arge domestic banks, on balance,  reported that they had lengthened 
maximum loan maturities.  Other terms  for CRE loans  were  reportedly li ttle changed.  Overall, 
the results for this special quest ion show the first time  since January 2007  that domestic banks 
had eased any of the CRE  loan terms covered in the survey.  
Foreign respondents reported having tightened some terms  and eased others on CRE  
loans.  On net, a bout 15 percent of foreign respondents reported that they had tightened debt 
service coverage ratios , but about 15 percent reported that they had increased  maximum lo an 
sizes.  Other terms for CRE loans  were  reportedly little changed on balance.  
LENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS  
Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending  
Most banks reported that lending standards for , and demand from, prime borrowers for 
residential real estate  loans to purchase homes w ere little changed over the past three months.  
However , when the responses are weighted by outstanding closed-end mortgages held on banks’ 
books, demand for such loans had weakened, on net , and modest net fractions of banks had eased 
standards.  Weighted responses, which may better account for overall activity in mortgage 
lending given that it is  high ly concentrated  among the largest banks,  have shown weak er demand 
and an easing of standards in  recent quarters .  Nonetheless,  standards likely remain tighter than 
their average level since 2005 , as reported in a special question in the July survey. 
Most b anks continued to report little change in their lending standards for HELOC s,  
a pattern seen since the beginning of 2011.  When responses are weighted by the amount of 
outstanding home equity loans, however, about 20 percent of banks, on net, reported having eased

  standards on HELOCs  in each of the past five surveys.  Meanwhile, the demand for such loans 
continued to weaken, on net, regardless of whether the responses are weighted.   
Questions on Consumer Lending  
As in the previous t hree surveys , small  fractions of domestic banks reported having eased 
standards on credit card, auto, and other consumer loans.  In addition, modest net fractions of 
banks continued to report having narrowed spreads and lengthened maximum maturities on auto 
loans.  However, o ther terms across the categories of consumer loans were  little changed on net.  
A few  banks, on balance, reported stronger demand for auto loans, with such  reports 
coming primarily from  large banks.5  A few  small banks reported stronger demand for credit card  
loans.  Demand for other consumer loans was reportedly about unchanged.   
ANNUAL QUESTIONS ON ASSET QUALITY EXPECTATIO NS 
The survey contained a set of special questions on respondents’ expectations for loan 
quality in 2012.  Overall, b etween 1 5 and 60 percent of domestic banks , on net,  expected 
improvements in delinquency and charge-off rates during 2012 in the  major loan  categories 
included in the survey , assuming that economic activity progresses in line with consensus 
forecasts.  These  questions ha ve been asked once each year for the past five years.  Expectations 
for improvement in 2012 were reportedly less widespread than when asked a year ago, but last 
year’s expectations were the broadest in the history of the question.  Furthermore, loan quality did 
improve noticeably over the past year .  
Banks were least likely to forecast  improvement in the quality of consumer loans in 2012.  
Only about 20 percent of banks, on net, expected improvement in credit card loans, and a similar 
fraction  project ed improvement in other consumer loans.  However, the current credit quality of 
these types of loans appears to b e high .  According to C all Report data available through the third 
quarter of 2011, the aggregate rate of credit card delinquenc y is at its lowest level  since 2006, and 
delinquency rates on other consumer loans are near lows  not seen since early 2008.  Cha rge-off 
rates for these types of loans are also low relative to the past four years.   
Significantly more survey respondents reportedly expect the  asset quality of 
nontraditional residential real estate loans to improve in 2012 than did  last year.  Indeed, about  
55 percent of banks, on net, anticipate that delinquency and charge- off rates on such 
nontraditional loans w ill decline this year compared with  about 20 percent of the respondents to  
last year’s survey .  Expectations for improvements this year in the  asset quality of prime 
residential real estate loans and for HELOC s stayed roughly the same as last year , with a bit more 
than one-third of the respondents anticipating an improvement in the quality of such loans.

  Regarding the outlook for the quality of business loans , about 50 percent of domestic 
banks, on net, reportedly expect delinquency and charge- off rates to decline in 2012 on their   
C&I loans both to large and middle- market firms and to small firms.  S maller domestic 
respondents were more likely to expect improvements in C&I loan quality this year  than their 
larger counterparts.  About 60 percent of domestic banks indicated that they expect improvement 
in the quality of CRE loans this year .  In contrast, foreign respondents, on net, reportedly 
anticipate  no improvement in the quality of C&I loans this year , and only about 25 percent of

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY  
We continue to see the risks around our projection for economic activity as 
elevated relative to the average experience of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by 
the FOMC) .1  The considerable risks surrounding the European sovereign debt crisis 
contribut e importantly to this assessment.  In addition, we still see the aftereffects of the 
financial crisis and subsequent recession as implying unusual uncertainty regarding the level of economic slack and the likely pace of the recovery going forward.  Moreove r, 
uncertainty about the capacity of either fiscal or monetary policy to counteract any 
further weakening in economic activity is high, and in the case of fiscal policy, is 
magnified  by the un sustainability of current policies over the longer run.  These factors, 
most especially risks from Europe, also lead us to continue to see the risks to real activity 
as skewed to the downside.
   
With regard to inflation, we see the risks surrounding our baseline forecast as 
balanced.  On the one hand, l ow levels of res ource utilization, small increases in unit 
labor costs, and the disproportionate possibility that economic conditions could be less favorable than in baseline could cause inflation to drift down over time.  On the other hand, concerns related to the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to execute a timely exit from the current stance of policy could cause inflation to move up, as might renewed increases in commodity prices or a sharper depreciation of the 
exchange value of the dollar.   With regard to the overall degree of uncertainty, we take 
some reassurance from the relative stability of inflation expectations.  In addition, the 
behavior of inflation over the past several years has accorded reasonably well with our assessment of how stable inflation expectations, shifts in the prices of imports and energy, and economic slack influence the evolution of consumer prices.  As a result, while we see considerable risks around our inflation projection, we do not view these 
risks as unusually high.  
                                                 
1 This assessment of heightened uncertainty holds despite marked increases over the past few 
years in the benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real act ivity.  In particular, as the fixed  
20-year window used to assess the typical size of forecast errors has rolled forward to include the 
pronounced volatility of the past few years, the estimated standard error for out- year projections of the 
unemployment r ate has almost doubled.  Thus, the benchmark estimates of uncertainty  about real activity 
are no longer dominated by the experience of the Great Moderation period.   (In contrast, benchmark 
estimates of uncertainty about inflation are essentially unchanged. )

  ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct ed several alternatives 
to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first scenario, we 
assume that  we have underestimated the extent of the balance sheet  repair  and 
improvement in  credit availability  that has occurred to date, implying a faster recovery of 
aggregate spending and production than in the baseline.  In contrast, the second scenario examines a downside risk to activity—namely, that household and financial institution 
deleveraging and weak confidence will restrain the pace of economic recovery markedly 
for many years, resulting in a “lost decade.”  The next two scenarios turn to opposi ng 
risks to the outlook for inflation.  The first inflation scenario assumes that t he margin of 
slack is currently narrower than assumed in the baseline and than policymakers estimate, resulting in more upward pressure on both actual and expected inflation.  Conversely, the second  inflation scenario considers the possibility that inflation will decline by more than 
we anticipate because the  persistently elevated level of slack in labor and product markets 
leads to self -reinforcing downward pressure on inflation expectations, along the lines of 
the predictions of accel erationist Phillips curves .  Finally, we examine two risks to the 
outlook coming from abroad —a severe financial crisis in Europe that spills over to the 
United States and the rest o f the world , and a sharp rise in oil prices driven by supply 
disruptions.   
We generated the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and an estimated 
policy rule for the federal funds rate  that responds to core PCE inflation and a measure of 
economic s lack based on the staff’s estimate of potential output.  In contrast, t he last two 
scenarios  were generated using the multicountry SIGMA model and a different policy 
rule that employs an alternative concept of resource utilization.
2  In all of the scenarios, 
the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow their baseline paths. 
Faster Snapback  
The economy may be further along in the financial recovery process than we have 
assumed:  Household debt service burdens have declined appreciably , while corporate 
                                                 
2 In the simulations using the FRB/US model, the federal funds rate follows the outcome -based 
rule described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.  In the simulations using SIGMA, the policy rule 
is broadly similar, but uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the 
model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of a slow adjustment in wages and 
prices.

  bond issuance and C&I lending have been solid.  Moreover, the apparent improvement in 
recent labor  market and production indicators may signa l that a sustained economic 
recovery is getting under way, and a greater release of pent-up demand for durable goods 
represent s an upside risk to our outlook; for example, the average age of motor vehicles 
on the road is still rising and the level  of the E&S capital stock is well below  its trend .  In 
this scenario, easier credit conditions, m ore-rapidly falling risk premiums , and pent-up 
demand  lead to a stronger pace of consumption and investment outlays.  Real GDP rises a 
bit more than 3 percent, on average, in 2012 and 2013, bringing the unemployment rate down to 7¼ percent by the end of 2013, almost 1 percentage point below baseline.  Initially, the stronger pace of recovery has little effect on inflation , in part because greater 
capital investment increases labor productivity, thereby holding down unit labor cos ts; 
anchored  long-run inflation expectations also contribute to the muted response of 
inflation .  Over time, however, tighter labor and product markets cause inflation to move 
above baseline.  Largely in response to the stronger pace of real activity, the federal funds 
rate begins to rise at the end of next year.  
Lost Decade 
Our baseline forecast depends importantly on steady improvements in credit 
availability, consumer and business confidence, the balance sheet positions of households 
and financial institutions, and the willingness of firms to hire.  In this scenario, these improvements are slower to materialize than in the baseline and cause the pace of the 
recovery to remain sluggish.  Moreover, the persistently slow growth in spending and 
output has a corrosive effect on the supply side of the economy because, with 
unemployment remaining very high for many years, the skills and labor force attachment of unemployed workers erode more than in the baseline.  In particular, the downward trend in labor force participation steepens relative to baseline while  the NAIRU  edges up 
to 6¼ percent by 2014 and thereafter declines only slowly, leaving it, on average, ¼ percentage point above its bas eline path over the simulation period .  In all, potential 
GDP expands about ½ percentage point less per year through 2016.  Under these conditions, real GDP expands at only a 2 percent annual rate, on average, through the middle of the decade.  With the expansion in aggregate demand only matching that of potential output, the unemployment rate remains near recent levels  through 2016.  As a 
consequence, inflation eventually falls below 1¼ percent  despite the damage inflicted on 
the functioning of the labor market .  With real activity so weak and inflation so low, the 
federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound beyond 2016.

  Greater Supply-Side Damage  
Although the staff estima tes that potential GDP growth has been relatively weak 
since the financial crisis, the supply side of the economy may already have suffered more 
damage than we judge.  In this scenario, the current output gap is assumed to be only 
about half as large as in  the baseline, reflecting smaller structural productivity gains over 
the past few years, a larger decline in trend labor force participation, and a higher 
NAIRU .  Less slack and lower productivity in turn imply higher unit labor costs and 
greater upward pressure on prices than in the baseline.  Moreover, t hese inflationary 
forces are amplified by the assumption that policymakers only gradually recognize the less-favorable supply-side conditions, which leads the public to expect somewhat higher 
inflation ove r the long run .  Under these assumptions, real GDP expands about  
¾ percentage point less rapidly per year, on average, through 2016 than in the baseline, partly because households and businesses recognize the weaker trajectory for trend income and earnings.  Meanwhile, core PCE inflation gradually moves up to around  2½ percent.  In response to higher inflation, the federal funds rate begins to rise about a year earlier than in the baseline.  
Disinflation  
The stability of various measur es of expected inflation to date may be misleading 
us about the potential for further disinflation, particularly in the context of a baseline outlook in which the economy is persistently weak.  In this scenario, both expected and actual inflation drift down steadily over time, with inflation reaching zero by 2015; such a decline in inflation would be in line with the predictions of some accelerationist Phillips curves.  As disinflationary pressures mount, investors become increasingly concerned 
about the economy becoming mired in persistent  deflation; as a result, bond premiums 
rise, thereby modestly damping spending and boosting unemployment relative to 
baseline.  In response to lower inflation and greater economic slack, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound through 2016.  
European Crisis with Severe Spillovers  
In this scenario, Europe’s fiscal and financial difficulties intensify in coming 
months to a markedly greater degree than assumed in our baseline.  This outcome could 
result from a disorderly sovereign default , a failure of a large European financial 
institution , or because the public loses confidence in the ability of European governments

  to resolve the c risis.  Specifically, Europe an sovereign and private borrowing costs soar, 
as corporate bond spreads rise 400 basis points above baseline, and household and 
business confidence plummets.  European real GDP declines  almost 10 percent  relative to  
baseline by the end  of 201 3, notwithstanding a 20 percent  real effective depreciation of 
the euro.  Given substantial cross- border financial and macroeconomic linkages, as well 
as the still-fragile state of the U.S. economy, Europe’s difficulties are assumed to have important spillovers to the United States and throughout the world.  U.S . domestic 
demand contracts sharply in response to higher borrowing costs ( corporate bond spre ads 
widen by more than 300 basis points relative to the baseline) , a much weaker stock 
market, reduced access to credit, and decreases in  household and business confidence.   
In addition, weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar depress U.S. net exports.   
All told, U.S. real  GDP contracts 3 percent this year and the unemployment rate rises to  
over 11½ percent by late 2013, nearly 3½ percentage points above baseline .  With 
substantially greater resource slack and  lower import prices, overall consumer prices in 
the United States decline in 2012 and 2013. 3  Under these conditions, the federal funds 
r 
ate remains near zero until  late 2016. 
Higher Oil Prices  
Although
 we project that oil prices will change little over the forecast period, 
there is a high degree of uncertainty around this projection.  The recent tensions with Iran over its nuclear program, with Iranian authorities threatening to block the Strait of 
Hormuz and disrupt global oil supplies, is just one example of the risks threatening the 
outlook for oil prices.  This scenario assumes that geopolitical disturbances drive oil prices $50 per barrel above baseline in the first half of this year before these prices gradually recede.  Although a supply- driven increase in oil prices might normally be 
expected to cause the dollar to depreciate, we assume here instead that the heightened geopolitical tensions increase the demand for dollar- denominated assets  and cause the 
dollar to appreciate slightly.  U.S. domestic demand falls relative to baseline because 
higher oil prices reduce permanent income and lower the return on investment, and real 
                                                 
3 The rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects the forward -looking 
nature of inflation determination in SIGMA.  Thus, long -run inflation expectations remain firmly anchored 
at 2 percent, producer marginal costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, and productivity is 
weaker (reflecting reduced capital sp ending).  In addition, import price inflation runs significantly higher 
than in the baseline as the dollar’s initial appreciation is gradually reversed.  Under alternative specifications of SIGMA that, for instance, would allow for more structural persistence in the inflation 
process or a less firm anchoring of inflation expectations, inflation would remain low for a longer period.

  exports also decline relative to baseline due to weaker foreign activity.  All told, U.S. real 
GDP rises only 1 ½ percent, on average, this year and next, and the unemployment rate 
hovers just below 9 percent in 2013.  Reflecting the jump in energy costs, overall PCE 
inflation jumps to nearly 3½ percent this year  but then moderates subst antially as oil 
prices begin their slow decline .  Core PCE inflation increases to about 1¾ percent in 
2012 and 2013 as firms pass on higher production costs to households.  Although the liftoff of the federal funds rate i s unchanged from baseline, the removal of monetary 
accommodation thereafter proceeds a bit more gradually. 
OUTSIDE FORECASTS  
In the January 10 release (based on responses gathered on January 4 and 5, before 
the release of the most recent labor market repo rt), the Blue Chip consensus projection 
showed real GDP rising 2.3 percent over the four quarters of 2012, ¼ percentage point above the staff forecast ; for 2013, the Blue Chip outlook of 2.8 percent is  almost 
½ percentage point above that of the staff.  The Blue Chip forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 was 8. 0 percent, somewhat  below the staff projection of  
8.2 percent.  Regarding inflation, the Blue Chip panelists anticipated that the overall CPI will increase 2 percent in 2012 and 2.2 percent in 2013, ½ percentage point higher than the staff projection  next year and 1 percentage point higher in 2013.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaledby real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for changein HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
