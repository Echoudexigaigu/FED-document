Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The data we have received since the Ja nuary Tealbook have, on balance, come in 
slightly stronger than we expected.  On th e one hand, indicators of final demand have 
been mixed:  Data on consumer spending have been disappointing, while data for 
residential and business investment have been  a little above our e xpectations.  On the 
other hand, several key production and hiring meas ures have surprised us to the upside.  
In particular, factory output rose faster th an expected in Decembe r and January, private 
payroll job gains since November have av eraged 60,000 per month above our previous 
forecast, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly declined further in January.  Taking all 
of this information into account, we have pushed up our near-term forecast for real GDP 
growth to an annual rate of 2 percent over the first half of this year, ¼ percentage point 
higher than in the January projection. 
We have also raised our forecast for real activity somewhat over the medium  
term.  The slightly brighter tone of the r ecent data along with a hi gher projected path of  
stock prices is expected to add to do mestic demand, while an improved outlook for 
activity abroad and a lower exchange value for the dollar are expected to boost net 
exports.  These positive factors more than offs et the adverse effects of an upward revision 
to the path of oil prices.  In all, we ex pect real GDP to expand 2½ percent in 2012 and 
2¾ percent in 2013, about ¼ percentage point fa ster in both years than in our January 
forecast.  As in previous Tealbooks, the rela tively mild acceleration in  real GDP that we 
are expecting over the medium term reflects a number of important headwinds, including 
continued worries about the European situation, a slow pace of improvement in financial 
conditions and the housing market, and an increa singly restrictive stan ce of fiscal policy. 
The incoming data also exacerbated a puzzl e that we have faced for the past 
several forecast rounds—specifica lly, the sizable decline in the unemployment rate since 
late 2010 has been difficult for us to explain given the accompanying sluggish increase in 
real GDP.  In this projection, we have moved toward a partial resolution of this puzzle by 
reinterpreting the extraordinary workfo rce adjustments made by firms during the 
recession and recovery.  In particular, we now  judge that firms were unusually aggressive 
in shrinking their payrolls as  the recession and financial crisis intensified, resulting in a  
rise in the unemployment ra te that was larger than what the average historical 
relationship between output and unemploymen t (Okun’s law) would have implied.  In

this view, the decline in the une mployment rate over the past year most likely reflects an 
unwinding of this discrepancy as employe rs’ concerns about a renewed economic 
contraction have faded.  To implement this  interpretation, we reduced the level of 
potential output in recent years, yielding a revi sed estimate of the output gap that is better 
aligned with our estimate of labor market slack at the end of 2011. 
Because we now view this unusual cyclic al behavior as hav ing largely run its 
course, we expect the unemployment rate to decline more slowly and thus move more in 
line with the usual Okun’s law relationship.  St ill, given the declines seen to date, the 
unemployment rate is projected to reach 7¾ percent by the end of 2013, ½ percentage 
point lower than in the January Tealbook.   
In response to the narrower margin of sl ack in this projecti on and higher paths for 
oil, commodity, and import prices, we have marked up our inflation projection relative to 
the January Tealbook.  We now expect core PCE prices to rise 1.7 percent in 2012 and 
1.6 percent in 2013; each of these figures is 0.2 percentage point higher than in our 
previous forecast.  With higher commodity and oil prices passing through to consumer 
food and energy prices, headline PCE inflation is projected to  be a touch above 2 percent 
over the first half of this year and to r un a little below core inflation thereafter.  
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
In line with the outcome-based policy ru le, we assume that the FOMC will hold 
the target federal funds rate in  the current range of 0 to ¼ percent through the first quarter 
of 2014.  The federal funds rate now begins to increase in the second quarter (two 
quarters earlier than in the January Tealbook forecast), a nd the subsequent rise is 
somewhat faster than before.  This change re flects revisions to the staff’s outlook for real 
activity and inflation over the medium and longer term.1  At the same time, we assume 
that the Committee will maintain the Federal Reserve’s current portf olio-related policies, 
1 Our historical revisions to potential output contributed to a narrower output gap over the medium 
term.  By themselves, these revisions would have brought forward the onset of policy tightening. However, 
the effect of the revisions on the liftoff date was offset by a technical adjustment to the outcome-based rule’s intercept to align it with the implicit value of th e equilibrium real interest rate in the staff’s long-run 
forecast.  As discussed in the Monetary Policy Strategi es section of Book B, simi lar adjustments were made 
to the other policy rules regularly reported to the Committee.

with the timing adjusted in a manner that is c onsistent with the revised liftoff date for the 
federal funds rate.2  
Interest Rates 
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities has risen about 10 basis points, on net, 
since the January Tealbook, as the market reacted to generally favorable economic news 
and as concerns about the European situati on eased.  Going forward, we have raised the 
projected trajectory for the Treas ury yield a little, in line w ith our upward revision to the 
longer-run path of the federal funds rate.  As in previous projections, we expect the 
10-year Treasury yield to rise substantially from the middle of this year through 2013, 
ending that year at 3½ percent.  This proj ected increase reflects the movement of the 
valuation window through the period of near-zero short-term interest rates, a gradual 
waning of the effects of nonconventional mone tary policy, and further unwinding of safe-
haven demands as apprehensions related to the European debt crisis continue to abate and 
the U.S. economic recovery progresses. 
Since the January Tealbook, spread s on BBB-rated corporate bonds and 
conforming fixed-rate mortgages have na rrowed significantly.  Nevertheless, these 
spreads remain above their typi cal levels, and we expect a further gradual narrowing over 
the medium term.  Coupled with our forecast for Treasury rates, these assumptions imply 
a moderate increase in yields on these private debt instruments over the next two years. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
Broad U.S. stock price indexes have incr eased about 4 percent,  on net, since the 
January Tealbook.  We project that stock prices  will rise at about an 8 percent pace, on 
average, through the fourth quarter of 2013, which would leave prices at the end of next 
year about 2 percent higher than in our prev ious forecast.  The projected appreciation in 
equity prices is now fairly steady.  This path  contrasts with our previous forecast, which 
had assumed more back-loaded gains given our  expectation that i nvestors would remain 
very cautious through the middle of this year in  light of the unstable European situation; 
2 The path of the federal funds rate in the extended baseline projection, and in particular the date 
when conventional monetary policy is assumed to begin to firm in the staff forecast, depends importantly 
on our use of the outcome-based rule to set the federal funds rate.  If we had instead assumed that the federal funds rate would follow one of the other policy rules discussed in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of Book B, the onset of liftoff could have been markedly earlier or later.  For example, under the Taylor (1993) rule or the first-diff erence rule, liftoff would occur this year.  In contrast, the nominal income 
rule or optimal policy under commitment would call for delaying the onset of tightening until 2015.  The prescribed liftoff date under the Taylor (1999) rule is about the same as that under the outcome-based rule.

recent developments suggest that market partic ipants’ concerns about Europe have abated 
somewhat earlier than we had expected.  Our current projection for stock prices is 
consistent with a steady but gradual decline in the equity premium, which has continued 
to be exceptionally high.     
The incoming data on home prices were, on balance, close to  our expectations, 
and our projection for home prices is unrevis ed this round.  As in January, our forecast 
calls for the CoreLogic Home Price Index to edge down about 1½ percent this year and to 
be roughly unchanged in 2013. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are essent ially unchanged this round and continue 
to imply that fiscal policy will be a noticeable and increasing drag on activity over the  
medium term.  In particular, we have mainta ined our assumption that the payroll tax cut 
and the Emergency Unemployment Compen sation (EUC) program—which were both 
recently extended through the end of 2012—will not be renewed next year.  We also 
assume that discretionary spending will be restrained by the caps set in the Budget Control Act, and that the automatic spending cuts stipulated by th at legislation—which 
are scheduled to take effect in Janua ry 2013—will be replaced by more-gradual budget 
restraint that achieve s the same amount of cumulative deficit reduction through fiscal 
year 2021.  Given these assumptions, we expect  federal fiscal policy to impose a drag on 
real GDP growth (excluding multiplier effects)  of about ½ percentage point this year and 
1 percentage point in 2013. 
We project that the budget deficit will narrow from $1.3 trillion (8¾ percent of 
GDP) in fiscal 2011 to $1.1 trillion (7¼ pe rcent of GDP) in fiscal 2012, and to 
$830 billion (5¼ percent of GDP) in fisc al 2013.  As in the January Tealbook, the 
expected reduction in the deficit primarily re flects the assumed tightening of fiscal policy 
(most notably the winding down of stimulus policies). 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Growth of foreign economic  activity slowed sharply to a lack luster 1¼ percent 
annual rate in the last quar ter of 2011, ¾ percentage point below our January estimate, 
but is expected to pick up to 3 percent in  the current quarter.  Activity in Asia was 
noticeably weaker than expected at the e nd of last year, but this weakness largely 
reflected more-severe disruptions to supply chains from the floods in Thailand; these

effects have little implication for our medium-t erm projections for Asia.  In the euro area, 
output contracted in the fourth quarter as  expected.  However, in light of the 
improvement in European financial conditions  and gains in some recent indicators, we 
scaled back our projected recession for the euro area.  Accordingly, we revised up our 
forecast for overall foreign economic growth by about ¼ percentage point over the next 
two years and now anticipate that foreign GDP  will rise 3 percent in 2012 and 3¼ percent 
in 2013. 
Since the January Tealbook, the dollar has depreciated about 1½ percent on a 
nomi
nal trade-weighted basis against a broad set of currencies.   From this lower starting 
point we expect the broad real dollar to depreciate at about a 2½ percent annual pace 
through 2013.  The rate of depreciation through the first half of 2012 is slightly faster 
than we assumed in January:  We are no longer building a further deterioration in market 
sentiment toward Europe into our forecast, so we have removed our assumption that the dollar would be buoyed by a further incr ease in demand for safe assets. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
Spot prices for major benchmark grades of crude oil have moved sharply higher 
since the time of the Januar y Tealbook, reflecting heightened  geopolitical tensions with 
Iran and supply disruptions in a number of  other countries, together with improved 
sentiment regarding the outlook for global growt h.  All told, the spot price of Brent crude 
oil is up about $11 per barrel from the time of the January Tealbook, closing on March 6 
at $123 per barrel.  Futures prices through 2013 have also moved higher, but not by as 
much as spot prices; hence, the Brent futures curve has become more steeply downward 
sloping, likely reflecting a belief  that some of the supply di sruptions hitting the market 
will be short lived.  The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has also 
increased but by less than Brent, as WTI inve ntories are relatively ample.  Our forecast 
for the price of imported oil has shifted up with futures prices:  We now anticipate the  
price of imported oil to stay roughly flat at about $111 per barr el for the remainder of this 
year before declining to $106 per barrel at the end of 2013;  this path is about $6 per 
barrel higher than our January Tealbook forecast. 
 Nonfuel commodity prices are somewhat higher than at the time of the January 
Tealbook.  Prices rose for a wi de array of metals, likely reflecting a brighter global 
economic outlook; however, these prices generally remain far below their previous peaks in early 2011.  On average, food prices ha ve also moved up relative to the January

Tealbook, in part on concerns about growing co nditions in South America.  Overall, we 
revised up the level of our forecast for nonf uel commodity prices by about 5 percent 
relative to the January Tealbook.  We project that commodity  prices will increase at a 
modest 2 percent pace over the forecast period.3  
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
We expect real GDP will expand at an average annual rate of 2 percent over the 
first half of this year, down  from a 3 percent pace in th e fourth quarter of 2011.  The 
fourth-quarter gain was boosted by a rebound in inventory investment, and the absence of 
such an inventory contribution in the firs t half of this year  fully accounts for the 
anticipated slowdown from the fourth-quarter pace of growt h.  Indeed, growth of final 
sales is expected to step up to a 2¼ percent average annual ra te in the first half, supported 
by a pickup in exports and a smaller rate  of decline of government purchases. 
As noted earlier, our near-term projec tion for economic activity attempts to 
balance some tensions between incoming da ta on spending—which, on net, have been 
about in line with our expectations—with mo re-favorable news on the labor market and 
production.  Relative to the January Tealbook, our projection for real GDP growth in the 
first half of this year is ¼  percentage point higher , as we have given some weight to the 
stronger labor market data, especially in proj ecting a recovery from the recent weak pace 
of consumer spending.  (The box “Assessi ng the Near-Term Outlook with Factor 
Models” discusses how our factor models—w hich pool information from a large number 
of data series—interpr et the incoming data.) 
The Labor Market 
Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve.  In January, private 
nonfarm payroll employment rose 257,000—up from December’s increase and well above the average pace of job gains seen in recent quarters—while the unemployment  
rate moved down another 0.2 perc entage point, to 8.3 percent.
4  These improvements 
3 In our forecast, commodity prices rise a little fa ster than futures prices as we have adjusted 
futures curves to account for the staff’s projection for modest dollar depreciation. 
4 The published labor force participation rate declined ¼ percentage point in January.  However, 
this decline reflects the BLS’s introduction of new po pulation controls from the 2010 Census; because the 
BLS does not revise historical data to reflect the new controls, the December-to-January change in the 
published participation rate was overstated. On a consistent basis, the BLS estimates that the participation 
rate was about unchanged in January.  They also reported that the decline in the unemployment rate was 
unaffected by the introduction of the new controls.

 Assessing  the Near‐ Term  Outlook with Factor Models  
Board staff economists  gauge the implications  of incoming  data for the near ‐term 
outlook in a variety  of ways, including  the use of a class of models known as dynamic 
factor models.  Models  in this class infer the underlying  state of economic  conditions  by 
looking across a large  number of data series for common  movements  that are 
interpreted  as arising from a shared  dependence  on a small number  of latent “common  
factors.”  The Board  factor model includes  124 variables  that span  data on spending,  
production,  prices, financial conditions,  and the labor market.  A range of  model 
specifications  are aggregated  to produce  overall estimates, with each specification  
making different  assumptions  about the statistical  properties  of the common factors. 
 
The common  factor that best accounts  for co‐movement across the various  activity 
variables provides  a useful summary  statistic for the state of  overall economic  activity.  
This “activity  factor” is comparable to other  indexes maintained  within the  Federal 
Reserve System; of these, the Federal Reserve  Bank of Chicago’s  National  Activity Index, 
shown in  the figure below for comparison,  is the most conceptually  similar to the  activity 
factor presented  here.  The activity factor has risen notably since the middle  of last year, 
reflecting  broadly shared improvements  across a range of  indicators.  
 
These improvements  in the near‐term outlook can also be seen in the factor  model’s 
assessment  of the likelihood  of a contraction  in real  GDP over the  next two quarters.   The 
figure at the  bottom of the next  page shows estimates  since February  2011 of the 
probability  of two consecu tive quarters  of declining  real GDP,  starting in the quarter at 
which the forecast is made; these estimates  provide a measure  of the probability  of being 
in a recession.   The recession probability  began to rise  late last spring and displayed  a

Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
March 7, 2012particularly pronounced upswing in the late summer, reflecting concerns about fiscal and 
financial conditions here and in Europe. As these concerns have eased, and as incoming 
labor and production data for the U.S. economy have shown greater strength, the 
model’s estimate of the probability of a recession has declined to its long‐run average of 
around 10 percent. 
As shown in the table below, the model now predicts real GDP to rise at an annual rate of 
1½ percent in the first quarter of 2012 and 3½ percent in the second quarter. The 
projected rise in GDP in the first quarter is held down by the weak trajectory of recent 
spending data. However, as a range of other data suggest greater underlying strength, 
the model’s projection for GDP growth in the second quarter rebounds to an above‐ trend 
rate of 3½ percent. 
The lower portion of the table shows the contribution of news about different categories 
of recent data to the revision in the real GDP projection from the factor model since the 
January Tealb ook. These contributions illustrate similar tensions to those confronted in 
the construction of the judgmental projection. Weak data on spending, particularly in 
PCE, has weighed heavily on the model’s projection of first‐quarter real GDP growth. 
However, the model has continued to be surprised by the strength of labor, production, 
and financial market indicators and, on the basis of those indicators alone, would have 
revised up growth considerably in both the first and second quarters.

have been mirrored by several other labor mark et indicators; for example, initial claims 
for unemployment insurance have continued to  trend down and indivi duals’ expectations 
of future labor market conditions have brightened further. 
The recent labor market data have been stronger than we expected.  Since 
Nove
mber, private job gains are now reported to have averaged 60,000 per month more 
than our January Tealbook forecast, the aver age workweek has come in higher, and the 
unemployment rate has declined more rapidly.5  In light of this recent strength and the 
encouraging tone of other labor market indi cators, we now expect that private payroll 
employment will rise 225,000 per month on average in the current quarter, about 75,000 
above our January forecast.  However, with overall economic activity projected to rise 
only modestly over the first half of this year, we do not expect this pace of job growth to 
be sustained; hence, our forecast calls fo r private job gains to step down to 175,000 per 
month in the second quarter.  In addition, Ja nuary’s low unemployment rate seems a little 
out of line with other labor market indicators and with broader measures of activity.  We 
therefore expect the unemployment rate to average 8.4 percent in coming months; this 
unemployment rate is about ¼ percentage point  lower than what we had expected in our 
January projection. 
The Industrial Sector 
Manufacturing production has continued to  post strong and widespread gains.  
Looking ahead, motor vehicle assembly plans have been revised up somewhat in the wake of strong motor vehicl e sales, while the availabl e near-term indicators of 
manufacturing production point to moderate gains elsewhere in coming months.  With 
strong readings for December and January in ha nd, we expect output in the factory sector 
as a whole to jump 8 percent at an annual ra te this quarter before slowing to a still-
respectable 3¾ percent pace in the second quarter.  For the first half, these gains in 
manufacturing production are a bout 2½ percentage points fast er, on average, than what 
we had expected in the January Tealbook. 
Household Spending 
With the exception of spending on motor vehi cles, which has rise n quite briskly in 
recent months, real PCE across a number of spending categories has come in lower than 
5 Unseasonable weather and difficulties with seasonal adjustment likely boosted payroll 
employment growth over the past couple of months.  We see little evidence, however, that the 
unemployment rate has been significantly distorted by these factors.

our January Tealbook forecast.  After rising at an annual rate of 2 percent in the fourth  
quarter, we now expect that real PCE will dece lerate to a 1¼ percent pace in the current 
quarter, ¾ percentage point lowe r than our January projection. 
Various factors point to fast er PCE growth next quarter.  Unusually warm weather 
has depres
sed expenditures on energy services  in recent months, and we expect this 
component of spending to pick up as weat her returns to a seasonable norm.  More 
fundamentally, we expect that continued empl oyment gains will result in a moderate pace 
of real income growth over the first part of the year, even with  the faster rate of consumer 
price inflation that we are currently projecting.6  Household wealth has been boosted by 
higher equity prices; in addition, credit conditions  appear to have eased a bit.  However, 
consumer credit remains tight in absolute terms, and households remain downbeat about 
both the economic outlook and their own income  and finances.  In all, we expect real 
PCE to increase at a 2½ percent rate in the second quarter, a touch faster than in the 
January Tealbook. 
Indicators of housing activity imply a su rprisingly brisk increase in residential 
investment in the current quarter:  After jump ing in December, the level of single-family 
housing starts in January remained considerably  higher than its fourth -quarter average.  
However, starts in both months were lik ely boosted by unseasonably warm weather; 
permits, which provide a better gauge of th e underlying pace of new construction, have 
only edged higher from a very low level.  Although homebuilder attitudes have improved 
somewhat since the summer and housing affordability remains high, other factors— 
including a lack of credit availability for purchasers and builders and a sizable overhang 
of vacant homes—continue to weigh on this sector.  Accordingly, we expect single-
family starts to step down in February and March as the effects of weather fade.  In the second quarter, we expect starts to edge  up to an annual rate of around 470,000 units— 
slightly above the January Tealbook but still de eply depressed.  In the multifamily sector, 
starts have risen slowly over  the past year or so from ve ry low levels in response to 
increased apartment demand and falling vacancy rates, and we expect further moderate 
gains in coming months. 
6 Newly available data imply that wage and salary  income was much higher in the third quarter of 
last year than the BEA had previously estimated. However, the resulting upward revisions to real 
disposable income relative to our Janu ary forecast do not appear to have persisted into the current quarter, 
largely because of weakness in other components of personal income.

Business Investment  
Real spending on equipment and software (E&S) rose at an annual rate of 
4¾ percent in the fourth quarter, notably slower  than in earlier quarters.  However, since 
the January Tealbook, we have seen further im provement in a number of forward-looking 
indicators of business outlays, including key surveys of business sentiment and capital 
spending plans.  In light of these indicators, we expect the rate of increase of E&S outlays 
to pick up to 5¾ percent over th e first half of the year, near ly 3 percentage points higher 
than our January Tealbook forecast.  
After showing surprising strength through most of 2011, business outlays on 
nonresidential structures excl uding drilling and mining are ex pected to be roughly flat 
over the near term.  This anticipated decel eration reflects the continued unfavorable 
conditions faced by this sector, including high vacancy rates, low property values, and 
tight lending conditions.  Neve rtheless, relative to January, we have revised up the near-
term trajectory for this component of cons truction spending in re sponse to stronger-than-
expected incoming data and a rise in the arch itectural billings inde x (which is a useful 
leading indicator of building activity two to  three quarters out).  In the drilling and 
mining sector, investment declined sharply in the fourth quarter afte r posting nearly two 
years of robust increases.  However, with oil prices still high a nd many opportunities to 
exploit new productivity-enhanc ing drilling techniques, we expect drilling and mining 
activity to return to a modest positive rate of growth over the first half of the year. 
What little data we have in hand sugg est that the level of nonfarm inventory 
investment, which rebounded in the fourth qua rter and contributed almost 2 percentage 
points to real GDP growth, ha s edged lower recently.  With inventories generally well 
aligned with sales, we expect this more modest pace of stockbuilding to continue in the near term.  Accordingly, we expect nonf arm inventory investment to shave about 
¼ percentage point from GDP growth, on average, over the fi rst half of 2012. 
Government  
Real federal purchases fell at an annual ra te of 7 percent in the fourth quarter, led 
by a drop in defense outlays.  Given the available data, we estimate  that real federal 
expenditures will weaken further in the curren t quarter and be roughly flat in the second  
quarter.  Meanwhile, data for the state and loca l sector continue to suggest that declines 
in real purchases are moderating:  State and local governments shed 8,000 workers in 
January after cutting 17,000 workers per month, on average, over the second half of last

year, while real construction spending has changed little since last summer.  We expect 
that real state and local purcha ses will decline at an averag e annual rate of  ½ percent in 
the first half; this forecast is similar to our January projection and follows a 2¼ percent decline in the fourth quarter.  
Foreign Trade  
 Real exports of goods and services are expe cted to increase at  an annual rate of 
6¼ percent in the first half of 2012, s upported by solid foreign economic growth 
(concentrated in the emerging market economies)  and the lagged effect of dollar declines 
through the middle of last year.  This projec tion is 1¼ percentage poi nts stronger than in 
the January Tealbook, reflecting bo th the lower path of the dollar and the upward revision 
to our outlook for foreign activity.  We expect  that imports will grow at a subdued rate— 
below 3 percent—in the first half of the year given modest U.S. demand growth.  
Because of the projected strength of exports, we expect the contribution of net exports to 
U.S. GDP growth to be about ½ percentage point in the first quarter and ¼ percentage point in the second.  In total, our forecast fo r the contribution of the external sector to 
GDP growth is moderately strong er than in the previous Tealbook. 
Prices and Wages  
We have revised up our near -term inflation projection.  Most noticeably, given the 
higher path for crude oil prices, we have boosted our forecast for consumer energy price 
inflation by about 5 percentage points on aver age over the first half of this year.  In 
addition, while we had anticipated some pickup in core inflation from its transitorily low fourth-quarter level, recent readings  have come in higher than expected.
7  These recent 
data, combined with some pass-through of the upward revisions to import and energy 
prices, led us to mark up our projecti on for core consumer price inflation by 
0.3 percentage point over the first half of this year, to an average annual rate of 
1.8 percent.  All told, we now project that headline PCE inflation will be a little above 2 percent in the first half, up from 1¼ per cent in the fourth quar ter and ½ percentage 
point higher than our  January projection. 
7 Incoming data for PCE prices also imply an upward revision to fourth-quarter inflation.  Part of 
this revision reflects newly revised seasonal factors in the consumer price index, which is used by the BEA 
to construct the PCE price measure.  (These revised seasonals boosted both core and headline inflation, with a somewhat larger effect on the latter.) When the BEA revises the fi rst three quarters of 2011 in their 
annual revision of the national accounts this summer,  we expect to see corresponding net downward 
revisions to PCE price inflation in these earlier quarters.

Recent data on labor compensation have been mixed.  The BEA’s incorporation 
of newly available source data for wage s and salaries caused third-quarter hourly 
compensation growth from the Productivity and Cost release to revise up sharply, to an 
annual rate of 5¾ percent.  However, availabl e indicators suggest that  this rapid pace was 
not maintained in subsequent quarters.  All told, we expect this measure of compensation 
to decelerate to a more  modest 2¼ percent annual rate of in crease over the first half of the 
year.  The employment cost index for priv ate industry workers ro se 1¾ percent in the 
fourth quarter, ¼ percentage point below our January Tealbook projection; we expect this 
measure to rise at an annual rate of  2½ percent over the first half of 2012. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
We raised our medium-term forecast for real GDP growth by ¼ percentage point 
in both 2012 and 2013, to 2½ percent and 2¾ percen t, respectively.  Th is revision reflects 
a number of factors, includi ng the recent news on the la bor market, faster economic 
growth abroad, a lower foreign exchange value for the dollar, and a higher path for stock 
prices—all of which have made us somewh at more confident that the pace of the 
recovery will pick up.  However, even with  these upward revisions to our GDP forecast, 
the acceleration in real output that we  are projecting over the medium term remains 
relatively mild, as we continue to beli eve that the economy will face a number of 
important headwinds.  In particular, we e xpect problems in the housing sector and the 
effects of impaired credit av ailability to ebb only slowly over time.  In addition, ongoing 
difficulties in Europe are still expected to weigh on U.S. growth—albeit to a diminishing degree—over the medium term.   Finally, fede ral fiscal policy is expected to become  
considerably more restrictive,  deducting a full percentage point from real GDP growth 
in 2013. 
With the revisions to the dollar and forei gn growth in this projection, net exports 
are now expected to make a positive contri bution to GDP growth of a little less than 
¼ percentage point in both 2012 and 2013; in the January Tealbook, we projected no 
contribution from this source.  The project ed depreciation of th e dollar and continued 
growth in foreign activity should bolster real  exports of goods and services, and in our 
forecast, exports expand just under 6 percent bot h this year and next.  Real imports are 
projected to rise about 3¾ percent per year on average in 2012 and 2013, as the boost 
from strengthening U.S. demand is offset by the drag from the depreciating dollar.

We continue to project that real PCE w ill increase a bit below 2½ percent in 2012.  
Although ongoing labor market gains are expect ed to put the traj ectory of nominal 
disposable income on a higher path this year  than we had previously thought, and the 
higher projected path of equity prices adds  to our forecast of household wealth, these 
improvements are offset by the draining effect of higher consumer prices, especially for 
energy.  In 2013, real PCE growth is expected to edge up to just above 2½ percent; this 
pace is ¼ percentage point faster than in  our January forecast.  The upward revision 
reflects both the continued boost to spending th at is provided by highe r equity prices and 
a stronger labor market—factors that also bolster consumer confidence. 
We have made no other material change s to our m edium-term GDP projection.  
As in previous Tealbooks, we  anticipate only a gr adual recovery in housing construction 
over the next couple of years.  Despite some  encouraging signals, the underlying level of 
activity in this sector remains deeply depr essed, and various factors—such as exceedingly 
tight mortgage credit and con tinued concerns regarding th e future direction of house 
prices—appear likely to wei gh on the demand for housing for some time.  In addition, 
while single-family vacancy ra tes have declined over the pa st year, the stock of vacant 
houses remains sizable, and we expect that th e flow of homes from foreclosure into the 
resale market will remain substantial.  Acco rdingly, our projection calls for single-family 
housing starts to rise only gradually, reach ing an annual rate of 570,000 units by the end 
of 2013—a pace that is far below the longer-run demand for housing.  
In the business sector, we continue to view  many firms as being hesitant to invest 
despite having the cash to do so.  However, gi ven the moderately faster improvement in 
economic and financial conditions that we ar e currently projecting, we have marked up 
E&S growth slightly over the medium term.  In addition, we now expect that firms will 
bring forward some of their remaini ng pent-up demand for capital goods into 2012, 
implying a flatter medium-term contour of  E&S growth relative to January.  
Notwithstanding the net upward revision to spending, our proj ection remains consistent 
with a relatively slow expa nsion in the capital stock. 
Our outlook for business investment in  nonresidential structures remains 
pessimistic.  Outside of drilling and mining, stru ctures investment is expected to be flat, 
on net, over the next two years as weak fundamentals (high vacancy rates and low 
valuations for commercial real estate, along w ith tight financing condi tions) continue to

modestly over the medium term, su pported in part by high oil prices. 
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR  MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU  
We have revised down our estimates of pot ential GDP over the past several years.  
The motivation for this revision stems from th e sizable decline in th e unemployment rate 
since late 2010 that occurred in the face of relatively modest output gains, and that 
therefore appears in consistent with our previo us supply-side assumptions. 
 We examined a variety of possible explan ations for last year ’s puzzling decline 
in the unemployment rate.  For instance, this  decline could merely reflect transitory 
noise; however, because it is sufficiently in lin e with the strength that we have seen in 
other labor market indicators, we are inclined to  take it at close to f ace value.  In addition, 
last year’s fall in the unemployment rate could reflect a lower rate of potential GDP 
growth over the past year, but the downward revision required to explain very much of the decline in unemployment would imply an implausibly small increase in potential 
output.  Likewise, a reduced degr ee of mismatch in the labor market or greater worker 
discouragement could be behind the recent dec lines, although the evidence we have been 
able to muster does not point to a large re duction in the unemployment rate from these 
sources.  Finally, the recent GDP data could be substantia lly understating the real output 
gains that have actually occu rred; however, incoming information, such as that on gross 
domestic income, does not suggest any substantial mismeasurement. 
Thus, while each of these factors may have played some role, to us they do not 
seem sufficient to account for the magnitude of the unemployment rate decline last year.  
Instead, we think that the bulk of  the explanation is that we had misinterpreted the nature 
of the earlier sharp rises in unemploymen t and productivity that  occurred during the 
worst stages of the recession.  We previously  assumed that the rise in the unemployment 
rate at that time  was in keeping with the usual Okun’s law relationship between the 
unemployment rate and the out put gap.  We now believe that the increase in the 
unemployment rate was outsized relative to  the movement in output, reflecting an 
exceptionally strong adjustment of payrolls by firms in reaction to the deterioration in  
economic conditions.  The sharp reduction in labor inputs also left productivity 
unsustainably high.  Then, as economic conditions improved last year, we see this process as having moved in reverse:  Hiring pi cked up in excess of what would ordinarily

 be expected given the improvement in de mand and returned productivity to a more 
sustainable level.  These developments m oved the unemployment and output gaps into 
closer alignment, or, in other words, redu ced the Okun’s law error that had opened up 
during the worst of the recession.   
This interpretation of the data implies that  the level of potenti al output has been 
lower in recent years than we had previous ly assumed.  We therefore revised down our 
assumptions for potential GDP over the past se veral years, leaving the level of potential 
output at the end of 2011 about ½ percent lowe r than in the January Tealbook.  We chose 
the magnitude of these revisions to bring the output and unemployment gaps roughly into 
line with each other at the e nd of last year, though we c onfess that this choice was 
somewhat arbitrary and we are far from cer tain that we have gotten their relative 
positions correct.  That consideration notwith standing, we do view the changes we have 
made to potential output as yielding a more sa tisfactory estimate of the output gap in 
recent years. 
Despite the revisions to ou r historical estimates, we have made no additional 
changes over the medium-term projection period to our forecast for potential GDP 
growth, and we continue to assume that poten tial output will rise a bout 2 percent per year 
in both 2012 and 2013.  In addition, the NAIRU is assumed to remain at 6 percent 
through 2013, the same level as in our January forecast.8 
Productivity and the Labor Market 
The stronger-than-expected improvement in the labor market has led us to mark 
down our projection for near-term productivity  growth.  Over the remainder of the 
medium term, we anticipate that firms will in crease their labor inputs more or less in line 
with output, implying a rate of actual productivity growth that is not too different from its 
trend growth rate. 
With little acceleration in economic activity projected over the medium term, we 
expect the pace of private employment grow th to hold roughly steady, with private job 
gains averaging just under 200,000 per month through 2013.  These monthly increases 
                                                 
8 Based on recent academic and staff work, we have  edged down our assessment of the effect that 
extended and emergency unemployment benefits are having on the unemployment rate.  As a result, our 
estimate of the “effective” NAIRU—w hich includes the influence of th ese benefits on the unemployment 
rate—is now 6.2 percent in 2012 (down from 6.4 percent in the January Tealbook); in addition, the gap between the effective NAIRU and the traditional NAIRU closes somewhat earlier (by the middle of 2013).

 are about 25,000 higher, on average, than our Ja nuary forecast as a result of the modestly 
faster pace of GDP growth that we are now projecting.  Outside of the private sector, we 
expect state and local employment to con tinue to decline in 2012—though at a slower 
rate than in previous years—and then to  rise modestly in 2013 as budget pressures 
diminish further.  These employment gains push the unemployment rate down to 
7¾ percent by the end of next year, ½ per centage point lower than in the January 
Tealbook; about half of the projected declin e over the medium term reflects downward 
pressure on labor force participation from the expected phase-out of EUC benefits. 
Resource Utilization 
Combined with the downward revisions to the current level of potential output 
that we have made in this forecast, the faster  projected rate of real GDP growth this year 
and next yields an output gap that is 1¼ percentage points narrower at the end of 2013 
relative to the January Tealbook.  Similarly, the downward revi sions to the projected path 
of the unemployment rate yield an unempl oyment gap that is ½ percentage point 
narrower at the end of the medium term than  in our previous proj ection.  Nevertheless, 
the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 is still projected to be 1¾ percentage points 
above the NAIRU; this extended period of labor market slack is likely to be associated with a continuation of other adverse labor market conditions, including below-trend labor force participation and an unusually large number of long-term unemployed. 
Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly reflects trends in the 
labor force, our concept of capacity for the industrial sector focuses on the capability of 
plants to produce with the equipment that is  in place and ready to operate and not on the 
potential workforce.  We expect slack in the i ndustrial sector to cont inue to be taken up 
more quickly than in the economy as a whole,  in part because manufacturing capacity is 
projected to rise just 1 percen t in 2012 and 1¾ percent in 2013.  As a result, at the end of 
2013, our projection calls for the factory opera ting rate to be just above its long-run 
average despite a still-sizable GDP gap. 
Prices and Compensation 
We expect that the wide margin of la bor market slack and low rates of price 
inflation that we are projecting will restrain labor costs over the medium term.  Both the 
Productivity and Cost measure of nonfarm hourly compensation and the employment cost 
index are expected to rise 2½ percent per year, on average, in 2012 and 2013; this pace 
averages about ¼ percentage poi nt per year faster than our January forecast, as we are

 now anticipating a sligh tly stronger labor market and higher path for consumer prices in 
the medium term.  Combined with our proj ection for moderate pr oductivity gains over 
the next two years, these compensation increa ses imply only a modest rate of increase in 
unit labor costs. 
We expect prices of imported core g oods to increase at an annual rate of 
1½ percent from the second quarter of this year through 2013, in line with our forecast 
for relatively flat commodity prices and mode st further dollar depreciation.  For 2012 as a 
whole, this forecast is ¾ percentage point higher relative to the January Tealbook, 
reflecting both recent declines  in the dollar and recent increases in commodity prices; in 
2013, our projection for core import price inflation is unrevised. 
On balance, measures of longer-term inflation expecta tions have changed little 
since the January Tealbook.  In the February  Michigan survey, median 5-to-10-year 
expected inflation increased 0.2 percentage  point from the 2.7 percent reading that 
prevailed over the preceding f our months; this move return s these expectations to the 
middle of the range in which they have fluc tuated over the past 10 years.  Meanwhile, 
expectations for PCE price inflation over the ne xt 10 years as measured by the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters were unchanged in the first quarter at 2.2 percent.  In addition, 
inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead  derived from TIPS spreads is about 
unchanged since the time of  the January Tealbook. 
With inflation expectations anticipated to remain stable, we project that the 
increases in energy prices now in train will have only a transitory effect on overall 
consumer price inflation.  And, as in previous Tealbooks, we anticipate that low levels of 
resource utilization will c ontinue to restrain core PC E inflation over the projection 
period.  However, in light of the narrower ma rgin of slack in this forecast and upward 
revisions to the projected path of import and energy prices this year, we have edged up our forecast for core PCE inflation by 0.2 per centage point in 2012 (to 1.7 percent) and in 
2013 (to 1.6 percent).  Increases  in energy prices are proj ected to boost headline PCE 
inflation above the core inflation rate over th e first half of this year, but as energy and 
food prices decelerate, headline inflation is pr ojected to run a little below core inflation 
thereafter.  (The box “Framework for Board Staff Inflation Projections” provides 
additional background on the factors that in fluence the staff’s inflation forecast.)

 THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff’s forecast through 2020 using the FRB/US model and 
our assumptions about long-run supply-side co nditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  
The contour of the long-term outlook de pends on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE in flation at 2 percent, consistent with 
the Committee’s statement after the January meeting on its longer-run goals 
and monetary policy strategies. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of secu rities follow the baseline-consistent 
portfolio projections reported in B ook B.  The decline in the System’s 
portfolio holdings over the long term contributes a bout 35 basis points to the 
rise in the 10-year Treasury yield afte r 2013.  Beyond that point, the System’s 
asset holdings are expected to have little influence on the level of term 
premiums. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds decrease gradually to normal levels, and banks further eas e their lending standards. 
 The federal government budget deficit (m easured on a NIPA basis) narrows 
from about 5 percent of GDP in 2013 to 4 percent of GDP in 2016, then 
remains roughly stable at that level through the end of the decade.  The decline in the deficit primarily reflects the effects of the st rengthening pace of 
the economic recovery on tax receipts and the budgetary restraint imposed by 
the Budget Control Act. 
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates 2 percent per year from 2014 to 2016.  The pace of dollar depr eciation tapers off thereafter.  The 
price of crude oil edges down about $3 per year from 2013 to 2016 and remains flat in real terms thereafter.  Foreign real GDP rises 3½ percent per year, on average, from 2014 through 2016 and then gradually edges down to a 3 percent pace by late in the decade. 
 The NAIRU declines from 6 percent in  late 2013 to 5¼ percent in late 2017 
as conditions in the labor market gradually improve, and it remains at 
5¼ percent in the long run.  Potential GDP increases about 2½ percent per year, on average, from 2014 through the end of the decade.

GAP is a measure of  resource utilization  (for example,  the staff’s unemployment  gap); Z is 
a set of other factors, including  changes in the relative prices of energy and  imports 
(supply shocks) and unusual movements  in nonmarket  core PCE prices; and ε is a residual.  
To capture the sluggish  adjustment  of inflation to changes  in expected  inflation,  slack, 
and other factors, the  equation includes  lagged core inflation.1  Nonetheless, permanent 
changes in expected  inflation eventually  pass through one‐for‐one into actual inflation.    
The effect  of slack resources  or other factors on inflation depends  importantly  on 
whether these factors  also affect inflation  expectations.   For example,  consider  the large  
increases  for the prices  of imports and commodities  seen in the first half of 2011.  When  
long‐run inflation  expectat ions are well  anchored—and  the staff’s assessment  is that this 
has been the  case in recent years—our models  predict that a transitory  rise in import 
price inflation will have  only a temporary  effect on inflation.   (Such  a scenario  is 
illustrated  by a simulation  of the stylized model in  the top panel of the figure on the next 
page.)  Likewise, a widening  of the unemployment  gap pushes inflation lower, and  under 
our assumption  of stable long‐run inflation expectations,  inflation remains at this lower 
level if the unemployment  gap persists (see the bottom panel of the figure);  but after  the 
gap begins to close, inflation moves back up toward its long‐run expected  level.   
Given this  characterization  of inflation dynamics,  we judge that the decline in core PCE  
inflation since last  summer partly  reflects the waning effects of the earlier positive  shocks 
to import  and commodity  prices.  Moreover,  given the apparent  stability of long‐run 
inflation expectations, we  project core  inflation will remain  below its long‐run expected  
value for some  time as the gap in resource  utilization  closes only slowly.  In addition,  the  
 
                                                 
1 In practice, we find that lags of inflation are economically  and statistically  significant  (and we 
typically include more than one lag of inflation in our forecasting  equations).   In theoretical  terms,  this 
evidence  of inflation inertia could stem  from a number of sources, including  costly acquisition  and 
processing  of information,  indexation  of wages or prices, or agents who set wages or prices wi th 
reference  to past inflation.

relatively  flat trajectories  for projected  crude oil prices (following  their recent increases)  
and farm commodity  prices are consistent  with our  forecasts  of small changes in food 
and energy prices  beyond mid‐ 2012.  Thus, headline  inflation is expected  to run a little 
below core inflation starting  in the second half of this year. 
Of course,  considerable risks  attend our inflation projection.   If inflation  expecta tions 
were to drift down in the face of a persistently  wide margin of slack in labor and product 
markets (as has happened  at times in the past),  inflation could move lower.2  Conversely, 
if inflation expectations  were to move higher—perhaps  in response  to a sustained  rise in 
commodity  prices—we could  see a more persistent upward  movement in  inflation.   
Moreover,  if inflation expectations  were to remain  well anchored  but resource  slack were 
to diminish  more rapidly than anticipated,  we would expect to see actual inflati on rise 
more quickly toward its long‐run expected  level.

assumed to be formed as a distributed  lag of past inflation rates  with lag coefficients  that sum to 1, 
inflation continues  to decline as long as slack is present.  Thus,  in that model, a transitory  change in slack 
results in a permanent  change in inflation because  the init ial decline in inflation leaves a permanent 
imprint  on inflation expectations.

 The economy is forecast to enter 2014 w ith output still significantly below its 
potential level, the unemployment rate we ll above the assumed NAIRU, and inflation 
lower than the long-run objective of the Comm ittee.  In the staff’s long-term projection, 
improving household and business confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and more-
supportive financial conditions enable real GDP to rise at an average annual rate of 
3½ percent from 2014 to 2016.  With real GDP expanding at a pace significantly faster 
than the growth rate of potential output, labor market conditions  improve markedly.  
Nonetheless, the unemployment rate is 6¼ pe rcent at the end of 2016, still ¾ percentage 
point above the assumed NAIRU.  With the margins of slack in both labor and product 
markets narrowing, downward pressures on pric e increases gradually ease, but inflation 
edges up to only 1.6 percent in 2016.  Later in  the decade, the economy settles down at an 
unemployment rate near 5¼ pe rcent (the assumed long-run NAIRU), with inflation at 
2 percent (the Committee’s objective) and a nom inal funds rate close to 4¼ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign economic growth hit a soft patch at the end of 2011 but, outside of the 
euro area, is expected to bounce back in the current quarter.  Real GDP growth in the 
foreign economies as a whole stepped down from 3¾ percent in the third quarter to only 
1¼ percent in the fourth quarter, ¾ percentage point weaker than estimated in the January Tealbook.  The deceleration in activity was widespread .  As we had anticipated, output 
contracted in Europe, reducing dem and for exports from other countries.  In addition, 
floods in Thailand disrupted its production and  its supply chains with other countries to a 
greater extent than we had written down in January .  These disruptions should prove 
temporary , however , and we p roject that foreign GDP growth will rebound to 3 percent in 
the current quarter, ½ percentage point stronger than forecast in January.  Indeed, data through February point to a pickup in global manufacturing activity.   
Foreign growth should remain near 3 percent through the rest of 2012 before 
edging up to 3¼ percent in 2013.  This forecast is  about ¼ percentage point stronger than 
the one in the January Tealbook, largely due to encouraging news from Europe.  In 
particular,  further easing in financial stra ins and better -than-expected economic indicators  
led us to scale back our projected recession for the euro area.  The less dismal prospects for the euro area, in turn, should provide greater support for global financial conditions and economic activity.  We have also marked up our forecast for foreign growth in light of more  accommodative monetary policy abroad and the stronger U.S. outlook.  
Nevertheless , Europe continues to pose important risks to the global economy :  The 
region’s  fiscal and financial situation remains vulnerable to any number of adverse 
developments, and European policymakers still face critical challenges.   
We project that foreign inflation will stay at  3 percent in the first quarter, rather 
than decline to 2¼ percent as forecast in January.  This upward revision is attributable to the recent run -up in oil prices as well as a surge in food prices in China, Japan, and 
Mexico.  Core inflation readings, in contrast, have been relatively subdued.  Therefore , 
with commodity prices projected to level off, foreign inflation should moderate to a bit less than 2½ percent over the remainder of the forecast period.  Amid contained  inflation 
and lingering concerns about the strength of the global economy, further monetary policy 
easing is expected.

  ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Real GDP in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) stalled in the fourth quarter, 
underperforming our January estimate of ½ percent growth.  Output contracted in the 
euro area, in the United Kingdom, and, unexpectedly, also in Japan.  The weakness  in 
AFE growth , however, partly reflected temporary factors , and recent financial 
developments and economic indicators have been more encouraging .  Accordingly, w e 
now project that real GDP in the AFEs will increase 1¼  percent in 2012 and 1 ¾ percent 
in 2013.  Although still quite weak, this forecast is ½  percentage point higher this year 
and ¼ percentage point higher next year  than in the January Tealbook.  In the euro area, 
although recessionary dynamics are in train and significant headwinds remain, financial conditions and economic indicators have improved, and the recession is now expected to be less severe than forecast  in the January Tealbook. 
Headline inflation in the AFEs jumped to an annual rate of 2½ percent in the 
fourth quarter from 1¼ percent in the third quarter.  This pickup largely reflected temporary factors that dissipated toward the end of last year.  Da ta for January and 
February point to a decline in  inflation this quarter , and, in view of substantial output 
gaps, we proje ct that inflation will come in at  1½ percent in 2012 and 1¼ percent  
in 2013.  This forecast is a touch higher than in the previous Tealbook, reflecting recent 
increases in energy prices  as well as somewhat improved growth prospects .  Given 
moderating inflation and persistent economic slack, we expect that the major foreign 
central banks will maintain  highly accommodative monetary policy through the end of 
the forecast period. 
Euro Area 
The outlook for the euro area has improved notably since the January Te albook.  
Financial tensions, although still elevated, have eased further in response to significant liquidity provision to euro- area banks by the European Central Bank (ECB) , the easier 
terms for dollar funding via the central bank swap  lines, progress tow ard more -effective 
governance over the region’s fiscal polic ies, and stronger commitments to  implement 
structural reforms.  In addition, a fter lengthy negotiations, the Greek government and its 
official and private creditors appear close to finalizing a restructuring of Greek sovereign  
debt and a second EU –IMF rescue package.  (For further details, see the box “ Recent 
Policy Developments in the Euro Area .”)  In view of these developments, our baseline

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  scenario now calls for  financial stresses to slowly  diminish, although the region will 
remain highly vulnerable to shifts  in market sentiment and confidence.  
Euro -area real GDP contracted at a 1.3 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, 
in line with the estimate  in the January Tealbook.  Output contracted  1¼ percent in Spain 
but much more sharply in other peripheral countries, including a decline of 3 percent in 
Italy, 5 percent in Portugal, and an estimated  20 percent in Greece.  The weakness is  
consistent with  the ECB’s bank lending survey for the fourth quarter , which showed a 
significant tightening of lending standards and terms by euro- area banks , in part due to 
difficult funding conditions .  However, this credit tightening  preceded  the ECB’s three -
year longer -term refinancing operations (LTROs) and subsequent easing of financial 
tensions.  Moreover, euro-area composite PMI s for January and February improved from 
their low fourth- quarter readings .  Business and consumer confidence also edged up in 
January and  February , although both remain at  very depress ed levels.  In response to 
improved financial conditions and somewhat better -than-expected economic indicators , 
we marked up euro -area output growth ¾ percentage point in 2012 and ½ percentage 
point in 2013.  We now forecast  real GDP to contract through the third quarter and  then  
expand at a 1 percent pace in 2013.  This outlook is still very anemic, however, as we 
expect fiscal and financial headwinds to hinder the recovery despite the recent 
improvement in market sentiment.   
Moreover, considerable risks remain , as euro -area policymakers  face a number of 
difficult hurdles.  First, t he Greek debt exchange must be successfully completed , and , 
over the medium term , Greece must implement politically difficult austerity measures to 
meet the terms of the EU– IMF program.   Second, European authorities have yet  to 
bolster their backstop for embattled sovereigns by increasing  the €500 billion cap on the 
combined capacity of EU lending facilities .  Such an increase, which would help to ease 
fears of  a loss of Italian or  Spanish access to debt markets,  is likely  but not assured.  
Third, Portugal ’s situation  remains precarious, and we expect that the EU and the IMF 
will have to strengthen  their  support.  Should European authorities fail to address these 
difficult issues, financial conditions and economic prospects could deteriorate sharply, as 
discussed  in the scenario “European Crisis with Severe Spillovers” in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section.   That said, it is possible that recent shifts in sentiment have initiated  
a virtuous circle of improving financial conditions and strengthening economic prospects, and this outcome could foster  recovery at a pace faster than anticipated in our baseline; 
such a scenario is also discussed in the Risks and Uncertainty section.

 Recent Policy Developments  in the Euro Area 
Since the time  of the January Tealbook,  European  policymakers  have focused on 
stabilizing  Greece and strengthening  euro‐area fiscal  governance.   Progress on 
bolstering  the euro‐area financial  backstop  has been  more limited.  Meanwhile,  
the European  Central Bank (ECB) has  continued  to provide  substantial  liquidity to 
euro‐area banks.1 
 
Notable strides
 have been  taken recently  to negotiate  a new aid package for 
Greece, which is crucial to prevent default on €14½ billion of Greek government  
bonds maturing  on March 20.  As  part of this new assistance package,  the 
European  Union (EU) and the International  Monetary  Fund (IMF) set an objective  
of reducing  Greece’s  public debt to 120.5 percent of  GDP by 2020.   Toward this 
end, the package includes significant  concessions  by private and official 
creditors, as  well as additional  Greek fiscal measures.  
 
In mid‐ February,
 the Greek government  and representatives  of its private 
creditors  agreed on a major debt restructuring.   This agreement  entails a 
53.5 percent reduction  in the face value of debt.  For  every €100 of eligible Greek  
government  bonds tendered  in the exchange,  creditors  will receive  €15 in short‐
term notes issued by the European  Financial  Stability Facility (EFSF) and €31.5 of 
new Greek government  bonds with maturities  of 11 to 30 years;  these bonds  will 
pay coupons  that rise over  time from 2 percent to 4.3 percent.  Bondholders  will 
also receive separate  GDP‐linked securities  that will pay up to 1 percent in 
additional  interest if Greek growth exceeds currently  anticipated  levels.  On  
February  24, the Greek  government  formally initiated the exchange  and set a 
response  deadline of  Thursday, March 8,  the day after this Tealbook  is finalized.   
 
To ensure substantial  
participation  in the exchange,  the Greek government  
established  collective  action procedures  that apply to Greek government  bonds 
issued under Greek law prior to December  31, 2011.  These  procedures  enable a 
qualified majority of bondholders  to impose  the agreed‐upon restructuring  terms 
on all holders of such domestic‐law  bonds, which account  for the  majority of the 
Greek government’s  outstanding  bonds.2  Moreover,  the Greek  government  
effectively  threatened  to default  on bonds that are not exchanged  and to 
implement a more  severe restructuring  if the current plan is not successful.     
 
Separately,  the Greek 
government  and its official creditors  have agreed on the 
policy framework  of the new EU–IMF program.   The program  includes austerity 
measures  designed  to attain  a primary  fiscal surplus of 4½ percent  of GDP by 
2014 (compared  with a primary  fiscal deficit of 5 percent  in 2010), structural

Refinancing  Operations,”  in the Financial Developments  section. 
2 In this instance,  a qualified majority  is defined as a two‐thirds majority  (weighted  by the 
value of their bond holdings)  of those participating  in the vote, subject  to participation  
amounting  to at least  50 percent of outstanding  eligible bonds.

reforms intended  to facilitate  a 15 percent reduction in  unit labor costs  by 2015, 
and measures  to stabilize Greece’s  banking system.  Subsequently,  the leaders of 
the two major  political parties in Greece provided  written commitments  to this 
new policy framework,  as requested  by the EU and IMF in light  of Greek 
parliamentary  elections  scheduled  for this spring. 
 
Euro‐ area 
member states, for their part, agreed to lower  the interest rates  on 
their existing loan facilities  for Greece.   In addition,  although  the Eurosystem’s  
holdings of Greek government  debt are excluded  from the debt restructuring,  
the Eurosystem  agreed to contribute  to the program  by forgoing  a portion of  its 
earnings on these holdings.   Specifically,  part of the income on Greek 
government  debt held by the Eurosystem  will be transferred to Greece.3   
 
In addition,  euro‐area
 finance ministers  are reportedly  scheduled  to approve  new 
EU–IMF financing  of up to €130 billion for Greece  within the  next week.  This  
funding is conditional  on a successful  debt exchange  and continued  progress by  
Greece on  its policy commitments.   Thus, a failure to achieve  sufficient debt  
reduction through the  debt exchange  could jeopardize  EU–IMF financing  and 
lead to a more  coercive  debt restructuring  or even a disorderly default.       
 
Should Greece
 default, the region still lacks  a credible  financial backstop  to check  
contagion  to other vulnerable countries  such as Italy and Spain.  Moreover,  
progress on bolstering  the firewall has  been limited  since the January  Tealbook.   
Euro‐ area leaders postponed  a review of  the €500 billion  ceiling on the combined  
lending capacity of the EFSF and the European  Stability Mechanism  (ESM) to 
later in March.  This delay has held up action on the IMF’s  proposal  to increase its  
lending capacity by $500 billion,  as major IMF shareholders  have conditioned  
their support  on a significant  expansion  of the euro area’s own lending  capacity.   
The issue remains unresolved, but there  are some indications  that, with several 
euro‐area countries  having dropped  their opposition,  Germany  may acquiesce to 
an increase in  the combined  EFSF–ESM ceiling.     
 
One reason 
some euro‐area leaders  have been reluctant to expand  EU lending 
capacity is their concern that it may weaken incentives  for vulnerable  
governments  to undertake  difficult reforms.   On March 2,  leaders of all 27 EU 
countries  except for the Czech  Republic and  the United Kingdom  signed a new 
fiscal compact  treaty, which commits  participating  countries  to pass laws that 
generally  require structural  government  budget deficits  to be no more than 
½ percent of GDP.  However,  implementation  of this treaty is not yet assured, as 
it still requires  ratification  by at least 12 euro‐area national  parliaments,  and 
Ireland plans to put it to a national referendum.   
                                                 
3 Indications  are that some euro‐area governments  facing  high funding  costs (likely 
including  Spain and Italy) will keep a portion of the income as compensation  for financing  the 
Greek  government  at rates below their own cost of borrowing.

  Euro -area inflation jumped to nearly 4 percent at an annual rate in the fourth 
quarter, reflecting the one- time effect of  a change in seasonal adjustment procedures.  
With data in hand through February, we project that inflation will decline to 3 percent in 
the current quarter.  This slowdown is 1 percentage point smaller  than forecast in the 
previous Tealbook due to the une xpected run -up in oil and natural gas prices.  As  energy 
prices flatten out and resource slack  remains considerable, inflation should step down to 
1½ percent in the second half of this year and stay  at that level over the rest of the 
forecast period .   
The ECB a t its February meeting left its benchmark policy rate at 1 percent.  Later 
in the month, the ECB conducted its second LTRO , allotting  €529 billion  to  
about 800 financial institutions (see further details in the Financial Developments 
section) .  We continue to expect that the ECB will keep policy rates unchanged  over the 
forecast period and provide significant liquidity support to banks, resulting in very low short- term market interest rates.  
United Kingdom 
U.K. real GDP contracted  at a 0.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter, a somewhat  
larger decline than we had expected, because of  a surprisingly sharp deceleration in 
inventory accumula tion.  However, a rebound in PMI readings in January and February 
suggests that economic growth turned positive in the current quarter.  Moreover, with the euro area now projected to undergo a milder recession, we revised up our outlook for the  
U.K. economy.  Real GDP growth is projected to average 1 percent in 2012 and 2 percent 
in 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy .  The Bank of England (BOE) 
announced a £50 billion (3 percent of GDP) expansion of its quantitative easing program 
in early February, which will bring its cumulative asset purchases to £325 billion 
(22 percent of GDP) by early May.  We expect the BOE to boost asset purchases by 
another £50 billion by midyear  and to keep the Bank Rate at 50  basis points over the 
forecast period. 
The BOE ’s decision to further ease its policy stance has been facilitated by a rapid 
deceleration in consumer prices around the turn of the year.  The 12 -month headline 
inflation rate dropped from 5.2 percent in September to 3.6 percent in January, in part as  
the effects of last year’s increase in the value -added tax dropped out of the equation.  
Moreover, c ore prices  have come in a bit weaker than anticipated , and, amid considerable

  resource slack , we project that headline inflation for 2012 and 2013 will decline to just 
below 2 percent.   
Japan 
Japanese real GDP declined  2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with our 
January projection of a very small increase, partly reflecting greater -than-expected supply 
disruptions from the floods in Thailand.  Ho wever, data on fourth- quarter capital 
expenditures , published after the release of the preliminary GDP estimate, suggest that 
output will be revised up to show a smaller contraction .  We project that real GDP growth 
will rebound to 2¾ percent in the current quarter.  Industrial production rose  at a solid 
pace in January  for the second consecutive month, and the manufacturing PMI for 
February points to further gains.  In addition, the enactment of supplementary budgets in 
November and February is supporting a pickup in reconstruction activity.  A s the boost 
from the reco nnection of supply chains ends and Japan’s own reconstruction efforts 
abate, growth should moderate to a 2 percent pace  for t he rest of 2012 and to 1½ percent 
in 2013.  This outlook is somewhat stronger than previously projected due to the recent depreciation of the yen and the upward revisions to growth in the United States and the 
euro area.  
In January, food prices spiked and core prices were higher than expected.  
Accordingly, w e estimate that inflation will rise from negative ¾ percent in the fourth 
quarter to positive ½ percent in the current quarter, nearly 1 percentage point more than in the previous Tealbook.  In response to the recent run -up in oil prices, the depreciation 
of the yen, and the stronger growth outlook, we also have increased our inflation 
projection a bit  over the remainder of the forecast period.  Nevertheless, we continue to 
expect prices to decline over this period at an average pace slightly below ¼ percent .  In 
mid-February, the Bank of Japan expanded its Asset Purchase Program by ¥10 trillion 
and announced a 1 percent goal for inflation.  Amid sizable output gaps and persistent deflation , we anticipate that the BOJ will further expand its asset purchases during the 
forecast period.  
Canada 
Real GDP in Canada rose 1.8 percent  in the fourth quarter, a touch less than we 
anticipated .  Howe ver, private consumption posted solid gains.  In January, employment 
increased for the second consecutive month, and in February, consum er confidence was 
up, and the manufacturing PMI remained in expansionary territory.  We expect GDP

  growth to hover between 2 and 2½ percent over the forecast period, up ¼ percentage 
point relative to the previous Tealbook.  The stronger outlook largely ref lects improved 
growth  prospects in the United States and Europe.  
Headline inflation moved up to an annual rate of almost 3 percen t in the fourth 
quarter,  partly r eflecting higher energy pri ces.  However, core inflation readings through 
January indicate th at underlying price pressures remained  contained.  Accordingly, w e 
project  that inflation will step down to 2¼ percent in 2012 and to 1¾ percent in 2013, a 
little higher than in the January  Tealbook given the recent increases in  oil prices  and 
improvement in GDP growth .  With  moderating inflation and lingering concerns about 
foreign growth , we continue to expect that the Bank of Canada will maintain its main 
policy rate at 1  percent through the end of 2013.   
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
With the bulk of fourt h-quarter  data now in hand, we estimate that real GDP 
growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs) slowed to 2½ percent in the fourth 
quarter from 4½ percent in the third .  This s tep-down reflects some cooling of the rapid 
pace of Chinese growth , weak er demand from Europe for Asia n exports, and the adverse 
effects of the floods in Thailand and a drought in Mexico.  The fourth- quarter estimate  is 
1 percentage point lower than in the January Tealbook, as the disruptions to output from Thailand  and Mexico  were even greater than we had reckoned .  We expect growth to 
bounce back to 5¼ percent in the current quarter , ½ percentage point higher than in our 
previous forecast.  Indeed, recent indicators—including PMIs, industrial production, and exports—have been mo stly upbeat.   
Over the remainder of the forecast period, we see EME output rising at a 
4½ percent  pace, supported by strong domestic demand, recent monetary easing  in 
several  countries, and the recovery in advanced economies.  This outlook is somewhat 
stronger than in the January Tealbook, especially for this year, largely due to improved 
prospects for the advanced economies. 
Incoming data on consumer prices suggest that headline inflation in the EMEs 
will rise to an annual rate of 3¾ percent in the current quarter, nearly 1 percentage point higher than expected in the January Tealbook.  This revision is driven by a jump  in food 
prices in China and Mexico ; elsewhere, inflation has generally been declining , as we had 
projected in January.  Food price pressures in China and Mexico should wane in the near

  term, and as a result , we see EME i nflation retreating to about 3¼ percent in the second 
quarter and remaining there over the rest  of the forecast period , in line with our January 
forecast .  Amid receding inflation pressures and continuing concerns about the outlook 
for global economic activity, a number of EME central banks, including those of Brazil, 
China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, have loosened  monetary policy 
since the time of the Ja nuary Tealbook.   
China  
We expect the Chinese economy to continue to expand at about an 8 percent pace 
this year and next, with solid domestic demand helping offset relatively subdued external demand.  This outlook is little changed from our projection in the January Tealbook.  The 
manufacturing PMI has continued to edge up from its recent low in November to  a level 
in February consistent with a solid pace of expansion .  Exports were flat in January, 
likely reflecting reduced dem and from Europe, although fa lling imports  caused the trade 
surplus to widen.
1 
After falling sharply during the previous few months, Chinese headline inflation 
edged up to 4½ percent on a 12-month basis in January, largely reflecting an increase in 
vegetable prices.  We expect inflati on to decline as food price pressures wane and to 
average a bit less than 3 percent over the next two years.  With growth relatively slow ( by 
Chinese standards) and inflation expected to decline soon, the People’s Bank of China reduced required reserve rat ios for banks by 50 basis points in late  February, bringing the 
ratio for large banks to 20½ percent.  Since Chinese authorities began loosening policy in November, reserve requirements have been reduced a cumulative 100 basis points.  We look for continue d appreciation of the Chinese currency against the dollar at a rate of 
4 percent for the remainder of this year and 5  percent next year.  
Other Emerging Asia 
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, output was flat  on average in the fourth quarter, 
although performance across the region varied considerably.  The floods in Thailand resulted in a contraction in that country’s GDP of about 35 percent at an annual rate, twice as much as we had anticipated.  D isruptions to supply chains also caused growth to 
be weaker  than  we had expected in the rest of the region, especially in Taiwan  and  
                                                 
1 Mont hly trade data tend to be unusually noisy at the start of the year due to variation in the 
timing of the lunar New Year holiday.

  Hong Kong.  In Korea and Taiwan, weakness in external demand appears to have spilled 
over to domestic demand as well.  In contrast, fourth-quarter activity was stronger than 
anticipated in  Indonesia and Malaysia. 
We expect growth in the region to rebound to  5½ percent in the first quarter as the 
effects of the floods dissipate.  Indeed, industrial production recovered  sharply in 
January, particularly in Thailand, and manufacturing PMIs through February continued to move higher across the region.  Beyond the first quarter, g rowth is  expected to average 
about 4½ percent, a touch above the previous projection given  the improved outlook in 
the advanced countries.    
Inflation in the region appears to be subdued on the whole, and we expect it to  run 
at about 3¼ percent over the forecast period.  Reflecting concerns about weakness in external demand , monetary policy was eased in a number of countries.   
Latin America 
Fourth-quarter growth in Mexico was disappoint ing, with real GDP rising only 
1¾ percent, about half of what we projected in January , and down from a third- quarter 
increase of about 5 percent.  In part, the sharp slowdown reflects a dive in agricultural 
output because of  severe drought conditions.  (Although this  sector accounts for less than 
4 percent of GDP, it contracted at an annual rate of 25 percent  in the fourth quarter.)  
Growth in the services sector was tepid as well.  In contrast, fourth- quarter figures for the 
manufacturing PMI and retail sales were more upbeat.  The expected rebound in the agricultural sector  and the anticipated pickup in U.S. manufacturing should boost growth 
to 4 percent  in the current quarter .  Thereafter , we expect Mexican growth to edge down 
to 3 percent by the end of the forecast period.  For 2012, this projection is somewhat higher than  in the January Tealbook, in line with the upward revision to  
U.S. manufacturing production. 
For South America, we estimate that economic growth picked up to a 3 percent 
annual pace in the fourth quarter.  R eal GDP in Brazil rose 1¼ percent after being flat in 
the third quarter, as private consumption picked up considerably but investment remained 
weak .  Economic indicators for the rest of the region suggest that activity was more brisk, 
with output in Argentina and Venezuela continuing to be bolstered by loose fiscal and monetary  policies.  We estimate that growth in the region will move up to 3¾  percent in 
the current quarter and then remain at about that rate  over the rest of the forecast period,

  with activity supported by high commodity prices, accommodative monetary policy, and 
the recovery in the advanced countries.  
In January, drought-related spikes in food prices pushed Mexican inflation , on a 
12-month basis, up to 4 percent, the upper bound of the central bank’s inflation target 
range .  However, food price pressures appear to be easing , and we expect Mexican 
headline inflation to move down to about 3½ percent later this  year, in line with our 
January projection.  I nflation in Brazil is expected to decline from an annual rate of 
6½ percent at the end of last year  to about 5½ percent  this year and next, though 
remaining significantly above the 4½ percent midpoint of the central bank’s inflation  
tolerance range.

Financial Developments  
Sentiment in domestic  financial markets  improved somewhat , on balance, over  
the intermeeting period , as economic data releases generally  came in to the upside of   
market expectations  and investors  grew more optimistic  about the situation in Europe.  
Broad indexes of U.S. equity prices increased, spreads on both investment- and 
speculative-grade  corporate bonds narrowed, and implied volatility on the  S&P 500 index  
remained near  the low  end of its range seen over the past  four years .  Partly reflecting the  
effects of the strengthened forward guidance included in the  January  FOMC statement,  
the expected path for the federal funds rate shifted down a bit in 2014 and beyond, and 
yields on longer -dated Treasury securities  fell somewhat .  Inflation compensation over  
the next five years edged  higher, apparently  because of  rising c  ommodity prices and a  
somewhat  improved economic outlook, while  changes in measures of longer- term 
inflation  compensation were mixed . 
In  foreign  financial markets, stock prices also  rose .  The U.S. dollar depreciated 
modestly against most other currencies as safe- haven demand appeared to  ease a bit.   
Yield spreads of peripheral  European sovereign debt  to German  bunds  generally  
narrowed , particularly for shorter maturities.   In addition, funding conditions f or 
European financial institutions improved notably.   
Domestic financing flows were mixed.   Bond issuance was  strong for both 
nonfinancial  and financial  corporations, and nonfinancial commercial paper and   
C&I loans  expanded  as well .  In the household sector, consumer  credit continued to 
increase in January, but r esidential mortgage lending remained moribund despite   
record -low mor tgage rates.   M2 advanced  at a rapid pace in January, boosted largely by 
gains in liquid deposits and currency, but M2 growth in February was more in line with  
the moderate pace  recorded late last  year.   
POLICY  EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY  YIELDS  
Policy expectations and Treasury y  ields moved down following the  release of the  
January  FOMC statement, which was reportedly viewed as somewhat more  
accommodative than  anticipated .  Investors  reportedly  focused  on the change from   
“at least through mid -2013” to “at least through late 2014”  in the forward  guidance 
regarding the period over which the Committee  expect s that the target federal funds rate

will remain exceptionally low .1   Most other FOMC communications during t  he period, 
including the  FOMC’s state ment of longer-run goals and policy strategy released on the  
day of the January meeting, elicited little market reaction.  However,  yields  edged up in 
response to the Chairman’s monetary policy  testimony  on February  29, which reportedly  
surprised some investors  by not providing much additional information about  the 
potential for further policy  accommodation.  Treasury  yields  were also boosted , on net, 
during the intermeeting period by  generally positive U.S. economic data and improving  
market sentiment regarding the  crisis in Europe.  
On net over the intermeeting period, yields on Treasury securities  with  maturities  
of two  years or less were up a bit, while  long er-dated Treasury  yields declined .  The 
Open Market D esk’s outright purchases and sales  of Treasury securities under the 
maturity  extension program did not appear to have any  material adverse effect on  
Treasury  market functioning.2  
Current readings of the expected policy path derived from OIS rates  sugges t that 
investors do not anticipate  that the federal funds  rate will rise above the current target  
range until the third quarter of 2013.  Th e near -term portion of the path is about  
unchanged since the January FOMC meeting.   Beyond mid-2014, however, the path 
shifted down a bit , on net, reportedly  reflecting  in part  the change in the Committee’s  
forward  rate guidance.3   The modal path derived from quotes on interest rate caps also 
shifted down beyond mid-2014 and remains within the current target range through the  
end of 2015.  Policy uncertainty measured from options on Eurodollar futures  declined  
notably following the  FOMC statement but ended the period slightly higher on net. 
Results from the Desk’s latest survey of primary dealers suggested that  
respondents expected no significant policy  change at the March FOMC meeting but had 
1 The initial downward revision in the policy path was tempered by the subsequent release of 
policymakers’ policy projections. These projections were initially read as pointing to an earlier liftoff date 
than suggested by the FOMC statement.  Nonetheless, yields declined markedly , on balance, during 
subsequent days as investors apparently concluded that the policy outlook in the FOMC statement was the 
most important signal of the likely future path of policy. 
2 In response to a modest deterioration in the strength of offers at some recent open market 
operations , beginning in February, the Desk reduced slightly the size of individual operations in the 
20-to 30- year sector but increased the number of operations from five to seven per month. 
As of March 6, 2012, the Desk had sold $233 billion of short -term Treasury nominal coupon 
securities and purchased $229 billion of long- term securities under the maturity extension program. 
3 The effective federal funds rate averaged 10 basis points over the intermeetin g period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.

pushed back slightly the  expected timing of tightening  since the last survey .  Respondents  
viewed  the  third quarter  of 2014 as the most likely  time for lifto ff of the federal funds  
rate, about two months later than they indicated in January.  Relative to the last survey, 
the median forecast for the target federal funds rate was unchanged through mid-2015 but  
was revised down about  15 to 40 basis points further out.  In response to questions about  
possible future options for easing, dealers modestly  revised down, from 55 percent to 
50 percent, the likelihood  they assigned to an expansion of the SOMA portfolio through 
securities purchases within one year,  and lef t unchanged at 50 percent the likelihood 
assigned to the Committee making c  hanges to its balance sheet  guidance within one  year.  
Dealers left their forecasts for real GDP growth in  the next three years  mostly  unchanged  
but revised up modestly their forecasts for  core PCE inflation. 
Near - term measures of inflation compensation ticked up, reflecting  rising  
commodity prices  and a  somewhat  improved economic outlook, while longer- term 
measures were mixed.  TIPS -based inflation compensation over the next  five  years rose 
4 basis points  over the intermeeting period , and  the swaps -based measure rose somewhat  
more .  At the same time , five-year inflation compensation five years ahead derived  from  
TIPS decreased  21 basis  points, while the swaps- based measure was  about  unchanged .   
Survey-based expectations of longer- term inflation  expectations  moved up a bit, on 
balance, over the intermeeting period, though they remained with in their recent ranges.  
SHORT -TERM  DOLLAR FUNDING  MARKETS  AND FINANCIAL  INSTITUTIONS  
Conditions in unsecured short- term dollar funding markets improved over the  
period, especially  for financial  institutions  with European parents.  In  unsecured bank 
funding  markets , the three-month L IBOR –OIS  spread  narrowed 10 basis points, and the  
spread between the three -month forward  rate agreement and the OIS rate three  to  six  
months ahead (a rough gauge  of investor  expectations of future funding  pressures )  also  
moved down.  Moreover, s ome foreign  institutions  have reportedly  begun to fund at  
longer  maturities in r ecent weeks.    
In  commercial paper markets,  the amount of asset- backed  commercial paper  
outstanding from programs with European sponsors remained stable, and spreads of  rates  
on such paper  relative to those on AA- rated nonfinancial paper decreased significantly, 
driven mainly by decreases in spreads of paper  issued by  entities with  French parents .  In  
addition, the average maturity of unsecured U.S. commercial paper issued by European banks moved higher over the intermeeting period.

Short- term interest ra tes have generally increased  modestly since the January  
FOMC meeting.   In the repo market, rates for borrowing against  Treasury  general  
collateral have been slightly elevated , on average, relative to their levels prior to   
mid-January, reportedly reflecting increased funding demand for  such repo s  by dealers in  
the face of unexpectedly  heav y issuance of Treasury bills.  Repo r ates and  margins for  
riskier collateral types were reportedly unchanged .   
CDS spreads of large financial institutions  continued to be somewhat volatile over  
the intermeeting period .  On net, changes in spreads  were  mixed  amid ongoing concerns  
about possible losses from capital markets activities, exposures to Europe, and an 
announcement from Moody’ s Investors Service that it was considering downgrading the  
credit ratings of several large  global banking organizations.   Bond issuance by financial  
firms  was  quite  strong  in January and  February , likely  in part to refinance maturing d ebt  
that had been issued during the financial crisis under the FDIC’s Temporary L  iquidity  
Guarantee program.   On February 9, state  and federal authorities announced an 
agreement with five large banks to settle claims of abusive mortgage practices, and  
indicated that actions against other large banks remained likely.  However, t here was  
little market reaction to this announcement, as the banks named had  already  set aside 
reserves to cover the associated costs.   The  equity  prices of l arge bank ing organizations  
were little changed , on net, over the period.  
Responses to the March 2012 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey  on Dealer  
Financing Terms  (SCOOS )  indicated little change, on balance, in  credit terms applicable 
to important classes of counterparties over the past three months, in contrast with the  
broad but  moderate tightening reported in the  December 2011 survey (see appendix).  
Moderate net fractions of dealers noted that demand for funding had generally increa sed  
over the same period.   However, in response to a  special question, dealers  indicated that  
the risk appetite of most client types  has  changed  little since the beginning  of the  year; an  
exception was “most  favored ” hedge funds, which reportedly displayed some increase in 
risk ap petite .  Nonetheless , one-fifth of respondents, on net, suggested that the use of  
financial leverage by hedge  funds had decreased somewhat since the beginning of  
December, although  conversations with market participants and some pr ivate -sector  
indicators suggest that leverage may have picked up more recently .

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
 The tone of  foreign  financial markets  generally improved  during the intermeeting  
period, supported by more  accommodative foreign  central bank policy,  
better -than-expected economic data, and some progress toward an orderly  restructuring  
of Greek debt  and  a second EU –IMF rescue package.  Nonetheless, conditions in Europe  
remain strained, likely reflecting c  oncerns that the Greek debt restructuring plan could 
unravel or  an adverse turn of events could put other European sovereigns and vulnerable  
banks under renewed pressure.     
Funding c  onditions for euro-area banks  eased over the period, reflecting in part  
further policy actions by  the ECB.  On  February 2 9, the ECB conducted a second  
longer-t erm  refinancing  operation (LTRO) , which provided European institutions with 
additional three-year funding of about €530 billion.  (See the box  “The ECB’s   
Three- Year Longer -Term Refinancing Operations.” )  Earlier in Feb ruary, the ECB had 
approved the plans of several national central banks to begin accepting a  wider pool of  
collateral, adding a  n estimated €200 billion to banks’ capacity to access ECB refinancing  
operations.  On balance over the period, three -month e uro L IBOR –OIS spreads narrowed 
about 25 basis points.  In addition, banks’ issuance of unsecured senior debt and covered 
bonds increased.   
Dollar funding pressures  continued to diminish over the intermeeting period, with  
the implied cost of dollar funding through the  FX  swap market falling  almost 20  basis 
points.  Reflecting  the improved market funding c  onditions, demand for dollars  at ECB 
lending operations declined, leaving the outstanding amount on the  Federal Reserve’s  
dollar liquidity  swap line with the ECB at $53 billion in early March, compared with 
$85 billion at the time of the January  FOMC meeting.  Outstanding amounts on the dollar  
liquidity  swap lines  with other central banks remained  small.  
Benchmark  sovereign bond yields declined over the period.  In addition, y ield  
spreads of peripheral sovereign debt over German bunds  generally co ntinued to narrow.  
The downgrades of several euro -area sovereigns during the period were widely  expected  
and seemed to have little influence on  bond yields .   
Conditions in capital markets generally improved over the intermeeting period.  
Foreign corporate credit spreads continued to decline, and equity markets  ended the  
period higher, particularly  in Japan and the emerging market economies  (EMEs) .  Net

The  ECB’s   Three‐ Year  Longer‐Term  Refinancing  Operations   
1 The ECB reduced its required reserve ratio from 2 percent to 1 percent and eased collateral rules by lowering the 
ratings threshold for certain asset backed securities. It also allowed national central banks (NCBs) to temporarily 
accept some bank loans as collateral, provided the NCBs retained the credit risk associated with such transactions. The 
last provision came into effect for seven NCBs on February 9. 
2 The total new liquidity provided by the three year LTROs is lower than the sum of the two operations, as the 
three year LTROs replaced some liquidity normally provided by shorter term operations. 
Financial Developments   
  
On  December  8,  2011,   the  European   Central   Bank  (ECB)  announced   measures   designed   to  ease  euro‐
area  financial  conditions.    The  ECB  lowered  its  benchmark   policy  rate  25  basis  points  to  1  percent,  
reduced  its  required  reserve  ratio,  and  eased  collateral   rules.1   In  addition,  the  ECB  announced   that  it  
would  conduct   two  longer‐term  refinancing   operations   (LTROs)  with  maturities   of  three  years.   
Interest  will  be  paid  at  maturity  of  these  operations   at  a  rate  equal   to  the  average  benchmark   policy  
rate  over  the  period,  and,  after  one  year,  counterparties   can  repay  all  or  part  of  their  allotment.    At  the  
first  operation,   on  December   21,  the  ECB  allotted  €489  billion  in  funds  to  523  institutions,   exceeding   
most  expectations.    At  the  second  operation,   on  February   29,  the  ECB  allotted  €530  billion  to  
800  institutions.    On  net,  total  ECB  refinancing   has  increased   €453  billion  since  mid‐Decembe r,  to  a  
record  €1.1  trillion  (see  the  lower‐left  figure   on  the  next  page).2   Ninety  percent  of  outstanding   ECB  
refinancing   now  has  a  maturity  of  three  years  (the  red  area  in  the  figure).

Page 56 of 104Along  with  other  measures   taken  by  European   leaders,  as  well  as  the  repricing  of  the  dollar  liquidity  
swaps  announced   last  November,  the  ECB’s  operations   have  contributed   importantly   to  the  recent  
improvements   in  euro‐area  financial  conditions   and  buoyed  general  sentiment.    Since   early  December,   
Italian  two‐year  sovereign  spreads,  for  instance,   have  dropped  about  400  basis  points ,  and  similar  
Spanish  spreads  have  declined   about  200  basis  points  (see  the  lower‐ right  figure  on  the  next  page).   
Sovereign  credit  default  swap  (CDS)  premiums  for  most   European  countries,  with  the  notable  
exceptions   of  Greece  and  Portugal,  have  declined.   Headline   equity  indexes  are  up  about  6  percent  in  
the  euro  area ,  and  bank  shares  have  risen  about  4  percent  over  the  same  period.  
One  way  the  LTROs  may  have  improved   market  sentiment  is  by  reducing  the  perceived   odds  of  a  
failure  of  a  large  European  financial  institution,   especially   in  Italy  or  Spain.   In  particular,   the  provision  
of  long‐term  liquidity  has  allowed  euro‐area  banks  to  substantially   meet  upcoming   funding  needs  at  a  
low  cost.   Euro‐ area  banks  are  facing  about  €470  billion  in  bond  redemptions   in  2012,  and  a  number  of  
them  may  have  found  it  difficult  to  raise  funds  in  private  markets.   As  of  December   7,  just  before  the  
ECB’s  announcement   of  its  new  measures,  average  yields  on  European   financial  debt  with  maturities   
of  one  to  three  years  were  close  to  4½  percent,  so  low‐cost  funding  via  the  ECB  was  attractive,   
particularly   for  banks  under  stress.   In  addition,  because  some  banks  likely  would  have  been  collateral ‐
constrained,   the  expansion   of  eligible  collateral   to  bank  loans,  approved   for  national  central  banks  in  
seven  countri es  on  February   9,  likely  boosted  participation   at  the  second  three‐ year  operation.     
Following   the  ECB’s  announcement,   funding  stress  for  euro‐area  banks  clearly  diminished.   Since  early  
December,  average  yields  on  European   financial  debt  with  maturities   of  one  to  three  years  have  
dropped  substantially,   CDS  premiums  for  Italian  and  Spanish  banks  have  declined  roughly  175  basis  
points,  and  the  three‐month   euro  LIBOR‐OIS  spread  has  declined  40  basis  points,  to  about  50  basis  
points.

The  LTROs  likely  contributed   to  lower  sovereign  spreads  through  two  channels.    First,  by  alleviating   
bank  funding  pressures,  and  thus  the  risk  of  the  collapse  of  one  or  more  banks,  the  LTROs  may  have  
reduced  the  perceived   risk  that  banks  would  require  substantial   government   support  in  the  near  term,  
lowering  potential   fiscal  pressure  and  hence  sovereign  spreads.   Second,  the  LTROs  may  have  
encouraged   some  banks  to  purchase  sovereign  debt.   Increased   access   to  the  term  funds  made  such  
purchases   attractive,   as  banks  could  borrow  euros  for  three  years  via  the  LTRO  (with  a  cost  at  
1  percent  if  current  policy  rates  persist)  and  use  the  funds  to  buy  sovereign   bonds  of  similar  maturity  
that  pay  higher  yields  (above  4  percent  in  December   for  Spain  and  Italy).   Indeed,  Spanish  and  Italian  
banks  increased   their  holdings  of  sovereign   assets  about  €80  billion  in  December   and  January,  and  
Italian  and  Spanish  sovereign  spreads  fell  especially   at  the  short  maturities  corresponding   to  the  
LTROs.   Still,  the  evidence  for  this  channel  is  mixed:    The  decline   in  those  spreads  began  even  prior  to  
the  December   8  announcement,   and  sovereign   spreads  in  some  other  peripheral  countries   also  
declined,   notwithstanding   the  fact  that  their  banks  did  not  increase  their  holdings  of  sovereign  debt.     
Observers,  in cluding  some  Eurosystem   officials,  have  noted  that  the  injections   of  term  liquidity  come  
with  some  costs.   In  particular,   the  substantial   expansion   of  the  Eurosystem’s   balance  sheet  combined  
with  the  broadening   of  eligible  collateral   exposes  the  Eurosystem   to  potentially   sizable  losses.   In  
addition,  the  easing  of  financial  conditions   ushered  in  by  the  operat ions  may  have  the  unintended   
effect  of  reducing  the  pressure  for  reforms.   Nevertheless,   overall,  the  ECB’s  three‐ year  LTROs  seem  to  
have  had  a  strong  positive  effect  on  investor  sentiment   in  Europe,  and  this  outcome   has  helped  buoy  
international   financial  markets  more  generally.

inflows into Western European bond funds turned positive in recent weeks, and net  
inflows to EME equity and bond funds continued at a solid pace through the period.   
Several central banks  eas ed policy  further in reaction to continued weak economic  
conditions.  The Bank of  England incr eased the size of its existing  gilt purchase program  
by  ₤50 billion to ₤325 billion in February, and the  Bank of Japan scal ed  up  its Asset  
Purchase Program  by ¥10 trillion.  The Bank of Japan also introduced a 1  percent  
inflation goal.  A number of EME central banks  also  eased  monetary policy. 
The broad nominal dollar de cline d modestly over the intermeeting period.  Amid 
an apparent easing of  flight- to-quality demand, the dollar depreciated agains t most 
currencies  but  strengthened  4¼ percent against the  yen.  The yen’s decline,  which reflects  
in part the currency’s safe-haven tendency to move  inversely with investor  willingness to  
take risk, was likely augmented by the monetary  policy measures announced by the   
Bank of Japan.    
Reserve accumulation by the EMEs continued to slow in late 2011 and some  
major official holders of  U.S. Treasur y securities  continued to diversify out of dollars, 
leading to foreign official outflows  from the United States  in December.   Modest offici al  
inflows returned in January.  Custody data  from  the Federal Reserve Bank  of New York  
indicate further official inflows in February.  Despite the improvement in market 
sentiment since mid -December, private foreign investors continued to buy  Treasury  
securities , on net, in both December and January  and showed limited appetite for riskier  
U.S. securities, while U.S. investors continued to sell foreign securities.  
DOMESTIC  ASSET MARKET  DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad equity  price indexes rose about  2¼ percent, on net, over the intermeeting  
period, exceeding the l  evels seen last  spring , prior  to the intensification of concerns about  
Europe.  Th is gain  appears to have been driven by improved sentiment about the  
European crisis , as well as somewhat better -than-expected U.S. economic data.    
Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index  remained near the low end  of its range

return for the S&P  500 index and the real 10- year Treasury  yield —a gauge of the equity  
premium—narrowed furth er over the intermeeting period  but remain ed  very wide by 
historical standards.

Aggregate operating  earnings per share  for firms in the S&P 500 index declined 
3 percent in the  fourth quarter , and bottom- up Wall Street forecasts point to a slight 
decline  in the first quarter  as well .  Moreover, an index of revisions to analysts’ forecasts  
of year -ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms remained in slightly negative territory in  
mid-February.   The se developments notwithstanding, profit margins  for large 
corporations  have remained high by historical standards.  
Yields on investment-  and speculative-grade  corporate bonds continued to decline  
over the intermeeting period and now stand near record- low lev els.  The spreads on 
corporate bonds over  comparable- maturity Treasury securities also declined , but they  are 
still somewhat elevated by  historical standards.  Prices in  the  secondary market for  
syndicated leveraged  loan s moved up further over the period, supported by  continued 
strong interest on the part of institutional investors  for this asset class.  The spreads of  
yields on A2/P2 unsecured commercial paper  issued by nonfinancial  firms over  yields on 
A1/P1 -rated issues  generally  fell slightly, on net,  over  the intermeeting period.  
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Issuance of securities by  domestic  nonfinancial firms has been solid.  Bond  
issuance by speculative-grade nonfinancial firms  was robust in January  and February, 
while issuance by investment -grade firms  increased sharply in February after a slow start  
in January.  Meanwhile, nonfinancial commercial  paper outstanding expanded solidly in 
January but dipped a bit  in February .  C&I loan growth continued to be significant and 
quite  widespread among domestic banks , though holdings of such loans  at U.S. branches  
and agencies of European banks decreased further.  However, despite  continued robust  
demand for leveraged loans from institutional investors, new issuance in this market has  
remained relatively weak.    
Borrowi ng c onditions for small busines ses are generally  still improving more  
gradually than are conditions for larger firms.  The latest data from Call Reports show  
that C&I loans with “original amounts” of $1 million or less—a large share of which  
likely  consist s of loans to small businesses —increased a bit in the fourth quarter.  The 
Survey of Terms of  Business  Lending in February indicated that the spreads charged by  
commercial banks on newly originated C&I loans of $1 million or less are  still quite  
elevated.   In the January  and Febr uary NFIB survey s, the  fractions of respondents  
reporting that credit was  more difficult to obtain w ere  little changed and still somewhat 
elevated despite having shown substantial improvement during the fourth quarter.

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms remained solid in January  and 
February, boosted by  continued strength in IPOs.   Share repurchases and  cash-financed  
mergers by nonfinancial  firms maintained their recent strength in the fourth quarter, 
leaving net equity issuance deeply negative.  
Indicators of the  c redit quality of nonfinancial corporations have  remained  solid.  
The aggregate ratio of debt to assets edged down in the fourth quarter, and the liquid 
asset ratio remained near  its highest level in more than 20 years.  The volume of  
corporate bonds of nonfinancial companies that were downgraded by Moody’s so far this  
year  somewhat outpaced the volume of those that  were upgraded, owing mostly to a  
downgrade of the debt of  Hewlett -Packard .  The six-month trailing bond default r ate for  
nonfinancial firms rose in January primarily  because of  the bankruptcy  filing by  Eastman  
Kodak.  The expected  year-ahead default rate for  nonfinancial firms from the Moody’s  
KMV model moved down in January, reflecting  a considerable reduction in stock price 
volatility.  
Financing conditions in the commercial real  estate sector remain challenging amid  
weak fundamentals and tight underwriting standards.  Prices for commercial real estate 
properties have continued to fluct uate at low levels , and vacancies and delinquency rates  
have remained elevated.   Issuance of commercial  mortgage- backed securities remained  
low in the fourth quarter  of 2011.  Many commercial mortgages that will mature in 2012  
were originally  made before 2007, when property  prices were still rising rapidly and 
lending standards were relatively loose.  Borrowers may  find it  difficult to refinance  these 
loans in the current  environment.   
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Although mortgage  rates  remained near their historic lows, conditions in 
residential mortgage markets  continued to be tight.  Mortgage delinquencies edged down 
further but  are still h  igh relative to their pre -crisis  levels.  House prices  ticked up in 
January but remained 3¼ percent below their  year-ago level .  Although mortgage  
refinancing  activity picked up slightly over the intermeeting period, tight underwriting  
standards and low levels of home equity  are still impediments to refinancing for many  
households.     
Consumer credit has  grown steadily in recent months.  The growth rate of  
nonrevolving c  redit has  returned to about its pre- crisis pace, largely because student

lending, which is now  almost entirely  originated by the federal  government, has  
expanded rapidly.  Revolving credit has increased more slowly in recent months than has  
nonrevolving c  redit, as nonprime borrowers continue to face very tight underwriting  
standards for  credit card s.  Delinquency rates on both revolving and nonrevolving  
consumer credit held at banks remained low in the fourth quarter, and delinquency rates  
on securitized credit card  loans  also were at low levels.   Issuance of consumer ABS held  
steady  at moderate levels in the fourth quarter of 2011 and in early 2012.  
GOVERNMENT  FINANCE  
During the intermeeting  period, the Tr easury Department auctioned  about  
$235 billion of nominal coupon securities across the maturity spectrum and $9 billion of  
30-year TIPS.   Auction prices  on nominal coupon securities  were generally near  or 
slightly better than expected, while  those for  TIPS  were  slight ly  worse than anticipated  
by market participants .  In the February quarterly  refunding statement, the  Treasury noted 
that  it was consider ing proposals to issue floating-rate notes on a  regular basis and that it  
would announce  its decision r egarding  such notes  at the next quarterly refunding  in May.   
Although municipal bond markets  were general ly receptive to new issuance and 
yields on long-term  general obligation municipal  bonds remained near historical lows, 
issuers were reported ly  reluctan t to borrow due to ongoing  fiscal strains.   Gross long- term  
issuance of municipal bonds was subdued in the first two months of the  year.  CDS  
spreads for debt issued by  states were roughly flat over the intermeeting period.  R atings  
downgrades of municipal bonds by Moody’s continued to substantially outpace upgrades  
in the  fourth  quarter, and higher-frequency data on ratings  changes suggest that this trend 
will lik ely  continue.  Moreover, Moody’s placed on review  the  ratings of  about  
$60 billion of municipal variable -rate demand obligations because Moody’s is also 
reviewing the ratings of  the financial institutions that provide liquidity support for these  
instruments .       
COMMERCIAL  BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit rose at a modest pace, on average, in January and February , mainly  
because of  strong increases in securities  holdings  and C&I loans.  The other major loan 
components in bank credit were relatively  weak over the first two months of the  year.  
Commercial real  estate loans  held by banks continued to decline, although the pace of  
runoff has slowed somewhat in recent months.  Closed-end mortgages rose modestly, but

home equity loans  continued to run off.  Consumer loans held by banks, which increased  
slightly in the fourth quarter, have declined more recently , as consumers apparently paid  
down holiday  credit card balances more quickly  than typical seasonal patterns would  
suggest and as  other  consumer loans also decreased.  Noncore loans grew  at a  slowe r  
pace than  in previous quarters.   
Securities holdings rose sharply over the past two months, as banks resumed 
accu
mulating Treasury  and agency debt securities and purchased  additional agency MBS.  
Other securities also continued  to expand .  According to more -detailed data  on banks’  
securities holdings  available from the fourth- quarter Call Reports,  banks have purchased 
structured agency MBS  in recent quarters.  These securities currently have higher yield s  
than other relatively safe instruments  and offer customized  maturities.    
The Call Reports also indicated that measures of the profitability of bank holding  
companies (BHCs)  in the fourth quarter  remained  below  their  pre-crisis level s.  
Moreover, after  adjusting for a number  of one- time charges and reven ue items that 
buffeted profits at the largest  BHCs during the final three quarters of 2011,  the  
industry-wide return on assets was about flat in the second half of the  year.   While  
lending strengthened in the fourth quarter, banks’  net interest margins  hovered  near the 
bottom of their historical range.  Noninterest income moved down, with activities related  
to investment banking exhibiting particular  weakness.  The industry as a whole once  
again used the release of  loan loss provisions to support earnings in the fourth quarter, but  
to a lesser  extent than  in prior quarters.  The aggregate credit quality  of loans on banks’  
books continued to improve in almost every asset  class.  Overall , banks continued to lift  
their  regulatory capital ratios, with the increase in  aggregate ratios driven by  asset sales  
and conversions of preferred stock to common stock at some large banks.    
M2 advanced  at a rapid rate in January but slowed to a moderate pace in  
February.  The level of  M2 and its largest component, liquid deposits, remained elevated 
relative to  levels that would be expected based on historical relationships with nominal  
income and opportunity  costs, reflecting investors ’ unusually  strong desire to hold safe 
and liquid assets  in current circumsta nces.  In contrast, retail money  market funds and 
small time deposits  continued to contract over the period , as rates offered on these 
instruments  provide little  additional  yield to  investors  relative to  liquid deposits.  
Meanwhile, currency expanded  robustly, driven by strong domestic and international  
demand for U.S. bank notes.  Boosted partly by the expansion in currency, the monetary

base also grew significantly over January  and February; in addition, reserve balances, the  
other major component of  the monetary base, rose  over this period.  (See the box  
“Balance Sheet Developments over the Intermeeting Period.”)  
The recent strength in money  gr owth followed a notable pickup in M2 growth  
over the second half of last  year.  It  appears  that much of the pickup in money  growth last  
year can be  attributed to several special factors.   Concerns about domestic fiscal issues  
and the European situation led to periods of substantial market volatility and strains in 
financial markets that appear to have heightened  demand for safe  and liquid assets.  As a  
result, and in light of the  very low interest rates offered on alternative short- term 
investments, investors shifted funds into M2.  In addition, noninterest-bearing demand deposits of more than $250,000 increased  $350 billion in the second half of last  year, 
supported by the unlimited FDIC insurance  coverage of those balances.  The FDIC  
assessment base was expanded in April to include all deposits of domestic banks, regardless of where the deposits were booked.  Th is change effectively  eliminated some 
of the benefit for banks  in booking deposits in their offshore offices, and, consequently, 
banks began to rebook some of these deposits onshore  later in  the  year, boosting the  
measured  U.S. money stock.

Balance  Sheet  Developments   over  the  Intermeeting  Period  
Over  the  intermeeting   period,   total  assets  of  the  Federal  Reserve  decreased   $48  billion  to  
$2,884  billion  (see  the  table  on  the  next  page).   
Since   the  January  FOMC  meeting,   the  Open  Market   Desk  conducted   29  operations   as  part  
of  the  maturity  extension   program:   The  Desk   purchased   $61  billion   in  Treasury   securities   
with  remaining   maturities   of  6  to  30  years  and  sold  $63  billion  in  Treasury   securities   with  
maturities   of  3  months  to  3  years.1   In  addition,   the  Desk  purchased   $35  billion  in  agency  
MBS  securities   as  part  of  the  policy  of  reinvesting   principal  payments   from  agency  debt  
and  agency  MBS.   Because   of  agency  MBS  market  conventions,   settlements   of  these  
transactions   can  occur  well  after  the  trade  is  executed.2    
Foreign  central  bank  liquidity  swaps  decreased  $32  billion  to  $71  billion,  primarily  
reflecting   a  decline  in  draws  by  the  European   Central  Bank.   The  net  portfolio  holdings  of  
Maiden  Lane   LLC  and  Maiden  Lane   II  LLC  declined  $1  billion   and  $5  billion,  respectively,  
largely  stemming   from  ongoing  asset  sales.    Proceeds   from  asset  sales  from  the  Maiden  
Lane  II  LLC  portfolio  on  January  19,  February  8,  and  February  28,  2012,  enabled  the  
repayment  of  the  entire  remaining   outstanding   balance  of  the  senior  loan  from  the  
Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  New  York  (FRBNY)  to  Maiden  Lane  II  LLC  on  March  1,  2012.3   Net  
portfolio  holdings  of  Maiden  Lane  III  LLC  were  nearly  unchanged.   Loans  outstanding   
under  the  Term  Asset‐Backed  Securities   Loan  Facility  (TALF)  declined  about  $1  billion  to  
$8  billion.   TALF  loans  with  three‐ year  initial  maturities   will  begin  to  come  due  in  late  
March.   
On  the  liability  side  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s  balance  sheet,  Federal  Reserve  note s  in  
circulation   increased   $27  billion.   Reverse  repurchase  transactions   with  foreign  official  
and  international   accounts   decreased  $3  billion.   Beginning   on  February  29,  2012,  the  
FRBNY  conducted   another  series  of  small‐scale  reverse  repurchase  transactions   that  
included  the  newest  set  of  counterparties,  eight  banks  and  two  new  primary  dealers.   
Reserve  balances  of  depository  institutions   increased   $87  billion  over  the  period.   The  
U.S.  Treasury’s  General  Account  declined  $83  billion,  and  other  deposits  decreased  
$76  billion,  reflecting   a  decline  in  GSE  balances.   Term  deposits  held  by  depository   
institutions   declined  $3  billion  to  zero,  as  a  small‐value  operation  of  the  Term  Deposit

Appendix  
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms  
Responses to  the March  2012 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing  
Terms  indicated little change , on balance, in credit terms  applicable  to important classes  of  
counterparties over  the past three mo nths, in contrast  to the broad but moderate  tightening  
reported in the December 2011 survey .1  About  one-third of firms, on net, reported an increase  in 
the amount of resources and attention devoted to the  management of concentrated exposures to 
dealers and other financial  intermediaries.   In the  previous  survey,  all but two  respondents had 
noted such an increase.   More than one-half of  respondents  reported an  increase in  the intensity of  
efforts by hedge funds to negoti ate more -favorable credit  terms  over the past  three months, and 
moderate net fraction s  of dealers noted such an  increase in efforts also on the part  of mutual  
funds, e xchange -traded funds ( ETFs ), pension funds  and endowments, as well as  insurance  
companies and nonfinancial corporations.  On net, one- fifth of  respondents, a smaller share than  
in the previous survey, suggested that  the use of  financial leverage by hedge funds had decreased  
somewhat  during the past three months.   In  contrast, a  small net  fraction of  dealers  pointed to  an 
increase in the amount of  leverage used by trading  real estate investment trusts ( REITs ).2   In  
response  to a  special question on client  risk appetite, survey respondents indicated that the risk  
appetite of most client typ es included in the survey was little  changed since the beginning of  
2012.  However, one-fifth of dealers, on net, reported that  the  risk appetite of most-favored hedge  
funds  had increased somewhat during that  period.   
With  respect to  over-the-counter ( OTC )  derivatives, respondents to the  March  survey 
indicated  that nonprice terms incorporated in new or renegotiated OTC derivatives master  
agreements were, for the most part, little changed during the past three months.  Dealers  also 
reported that initial mar gin requirements, which fall outside the scope  of  the master agreement, 
were largely  unchanged  over the same period .  However,  a modest net percentage  of respondents  
indicated that the posting of nonstandard collateral  (that is, other  than cash and U.S. Tr easury  
securities) permitted  under relevant  agreements h  ad increased  somewhat .  
With regard to securities financing, survey respondents indicated  that  the credit terms 
applicable to the securities types included in the survey  were generally  little changed,  on balance, 
over the past three months.   
1 The March survey collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three months in 
credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over -the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.  In 
addition to the core set of questions, this survey incl uded a special question about changes in risk appetite 
for different client types, a second special question that focused on third -party custody of independent 
amounts (initial margin) and collateral, and a final set of special questions regarding recent d evelopments 
in securities lending.  The 20 institutions participating in the survey account for almost all of the dealer 
financing of dollar -denominated securities for nondealers and are the most active intermediaries in OTC 
derivatives markets.  The surve y was conducted during the period from February 14, 2012, to 
February 27, 2012. The core questions ask about changes between December 2011 and February 2012.

Moderate net fractions of dealers  reported that both overall demand for  funding as well  as  
demand for  term funding with maturity greater  than 30 days had generally increased over the  
same period.  Moreover,  dealers noted that  liquidity and functioning in the underlying asset  
markets had improved.   
A special  que stion asked about changes in the past six months in the  intensity of efforts  
by respondents’ clients to negotiate arrangements for  the custody by third parti es  of collateral and  
margin posted with the  respondent’s  institution as  a risk m  itigant.  About two-thirds of dealers, on 
net, pointed to an increase  in such efforts, with a few  respondents noting that  these efforts had 
increased considerably.  
A final set of special  questions queried dealers about recent developments in  securities 
lending.  One-fourth of respondents  reported an increase in the amount of  resources and attention 
devoted to the management of credit  exposure  related to their posting of collater al pursuant to 
securities borrowed (to facilitate their own trading activities  or on behalf of  prime brokerage or  
other clients).  Survey respondents indicated significant heterogeneity, as of  the beginning of  
2012, in the share  of  the dollar volume of col lateral posted  pursuant to securities borrowed that  
consisted of cash collateral, with a  modest  fraction of dealers reporting an increase in the share of  
noncash collateral ( that is , securities) over  the past six months.  Finally, four- fifths of respondents 
noted  that securities lending programs administered by custodian banks or other  agents were the 
largest source, by volume, of borrowed securities  as of the beginning of 2012.  
COUNTERPARTY  TYPES  
Dealers and  Other Financial I ntermediaries   
In the  March  survey, about one -third of respondents, on net, indicated that the amount of  
resources and attention devoted  to management of concentrated  credit  exposure to dealers and  
other financial  intermediaries had  increased over  the past three months.  In th e December survey,  
all but two respondents reported  such  an increase.   The sm aller  net increase relative to the 
December survey in the number of firms reporting increased resources devoted to  management of  
concentrated  credit exposure to dealers and other  financial intermediaries  suggests that dealers,  as 
a group, see less need now  than at  the  end of November 2011 to increase their monitoring of the  
financial  and operational condition of other major financial institutions.  
Central Counterparties and Other F inancial Utilities  
More than one- half of  dealers indicated that  the amount of resources and attention 
devoted to management of  concentrated exposures to  central counterparties and  other  financial  
utilities had increased over  the past  three months.   This fr action  is similar to  that observed  in the  
previous two  surveys , and it is consistent with other indications  that changes in market 
conventions  and practices  associated  with the increased  clearing of OTC derivatives trades 
mandated by the  Dodd –Frank Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection  Act  continue to be a  
focus for risk managers at dealer firms.

Hedge F unds  
The survey responses suggested  that price  and nonprice terms applicable  to hedge funds  
were  little changed  over the past  three months.  Only a  few dealers reported having eased price 
terms (such as financing rates)  or nonprice  terms (including haircuts, maximum  maturity, 
covenants, cure periods, cross-default provisions, or other documentation features)  offered to 
hedge funds  across the spectrum  of securities financing and OTC derivative transactions.  The  
few institutions  that reported an easing of  credit terms pointed to more- aggressive competition  
from other institutions and an improvement in general  market liquidity and functioning  as the 
reasons  for doing so.  More than one-half  of dealers, a larger fraction than in December, reported 
an increase  in the  intensity  of efforts by hedge funds to negotiate more- favorable price and  
nonprice terms over the past three months.   Despite credit terms th at  were said  to be little  
changed , one-fifth of respondents—a smaller share  than in the  December  survey —suggested  that  
the use of financial  leverage by hedge funds, considering the entire range of  transactions  
facilitated,  had decreased somewhat over the past three months.3   A  similar fraction  of  dealers  
noted that  the availability of additional  financial  leverage under agreements currently in place 
with hedge funds had also  decreased somewhat.   Finally, a modest net fraction of  respondents  
indicated that  the provision  of differential terms to most-favored hedge funds had increased 
somewhat over the past  three months.    
For the remaining counterparty types  included in the  survey, and discussed in more detail  
below, nearly all  of the  dealers reported  that ap plicable price and nonprice terms were basically  
unchanged during the past  three months.  However, the few dealers  that did report  a change in 
credit  terms tended to  report an easing of terms.4    
Trading R eal  Estate  Investment  Trusts  
Nearly all survey resp ondents reported that price and nonprice terms offered to trading  
REITs  had remained basically  unchanged over the past three months.  A modest  net  fraction  of  
dealers  indicated that  the use of  financial leverage by trading REITs had increased  somewhat over  
the  same period .   
Mutual Funds, Exchange -Traded Funds, Pension Plans, and Endowments  
The survey responses suggested that,  on balance,  there had been little change in  the p rice 
and nonprice  terms offered to mutual  funds, ETFs, pension plans, and endowments during the  
past three months.  Of note, about  one-third of  respondents  stated that  the  intensity of efforts by  
clients in this category to negotiate more-favorable credit  terms had increased  somewhat  over the  
3 Among the subsample of firms with a significant presence in almost all of the business areas 
covered in the survey (broad -scope dealers), responses were mixed.  The majority of respondents reported 
that the use of financial leverage by hedge funds had remained basically unchanged over the past three 
months.  However, a few firms indicated that financial leverage had increased somewhat, while a few firms stated that it had decreased somewhat over the same period. 
4 One or more dealers, on net, reported an easing of price or nonprice credit terms for trading 
REITs, separately managed accounts established with investment advisers, and nonfinancial corporations, 
as well as mutual funds, ETFs, pension funds and endowments.

same period .  A modest net fraction of respondents  indicated that the provision of  differential  
terms to most -favored mutual funds, ETFs, pension plans, and endowments had increased 
somewhat over the past  three months.  
Insurance Companies  
Dealers  reported that  price and nonprice terms applicable to insurance companies had 
remained  basically unchanged over the past  three months despite  a continued  increase in  the  
intensity of efforts by  such clients to negotiate more- favorable credit  terms.  
Separately Managed Accounts  Established with I  nvestment  Advisers  
Nearly all of the  dealers  indicated that price and nonprice terms negotiated by investment  
advisers on behalf of separately managed accounts were basically  unchanged during the past  
three months.  Only a couple of  respondents noted an increase  in the  intensity of efforts by such 
clients to negotiate more- favorable credit  terms.    
Nonfinancial Corporations  
Survey respondents reported that, on balance, price  and nonprice te rms  offered to  
nonfinancial corporations  had changed little  over  the past  three months.  O ne-fourth of  
respondents , however,  indicated that  the  intensity of  efforts by nonfinancial  corporations to 
negotiate more- favorable terms had increased  somewhat over  the past three months. 
Mark and Collateral Disputes  
Nearly all of the  respondents stated that  the volume, persistence, and duration of mark  
and collateral disputes with  each counterparty  type included in the survey  were basically  
unchanged over  the past three months.   
OVER-THE-COUNTER  DERIVATIVES  
As in the December survey, dealers reported that nonprice  terms incorporated in new or  
renegotiated OTC derivatives master  agreements were broadly unchanged over  the past  three 
months.5   However, a few  responden ts indicated that they  had  tightened  requirements, timelines,  
and thresholds for posting additional margins, and that  they had tightened triggers  and covenants  
in master  agreements.  Nearly all  of the  survey respondents noted that initial margins (which fa ll  
outside the scope of  the master agreement) on contracts referencing most underlying collateral  
types were basically unchanged over the past three months  for both average and most -favored 
clients .  A modest net  fraction of  respondents  indicated that the posting of nonstandard collateral  
(that is,  other than cash and U.S. Treasury securities ) permitted under relevant agreements had  
increased  somewhat.   For most contract types included in the  survey, a lmost all dealers reported

collateral, recognition of portfolio or diversification benefits, triggers and covenants, and other 
documentation features , including cure periods and cross -default provisions.

that the volume, duration, and persistence of mark and collateral disputes remained basically  
unchanged over  the past three months.  
SECURITIES  FINANCING  
Respondents indicated that  credit  terms under which most  types of  securities  included in 
the survey are financed were  little changed , on balance, over the  past three months.   Where 
changes in credit  terms w  ere reported , however, movements in both directions were evident .  For  
example, modest net fractions of dealers indicated that  credit  terms had eased  for high -grade 
corporate bonds, while similar modest net percentages  reported a  tightening of credit  terms for  
agency and non- agency residential mortgage -backed securities.  Overall, the changes that dealers 
reported in  credit terms in  this survey differed  little between average and most -favored clients.   
Moderate net fractions of dealers  noted that  both overall demand for  funding and demand 
for  term funding with a maturity greater than 30 days had generally increased for the types of  
securities included in  the survey.    
Moderate net fractions of d ealers  also generally indicated that liquidity and  functioning in  
the underlying asset markets for collateral types covered by the survey had improved over the 
past  three months.   These responses may well reflect a  reduction, between December and 
February, in concerns  about the situation in Europe and its  possible effects  on financial markets.  
The improvement in liquidity and functioning was most evident for commercial mortgage- backed  
securities and consumer asset -backed securities.6   The  improvement in liquidity and functioning  
reported in the March survey contrasts with a deterioration reported in the  responses to the  
previous two surveys.  Nearly all  of the  respondents reported that  the volume, duration, and  
persistence of mark and collateral disputes were basically unchanged for  all collateral types.  
SPECIAL  QUESTIONS ON CLIENT  RISK  APPETITE  
Anecdotal  reports suggested that investor risk appetite declined  during the  final months  
of 2011.   A special question asked  about changes in respondents’ overall  assessment of the risk  
appetite of different client types since the beginning of 2012.  Survey respondents  indicated that  
the risk appetite of most  types of clients included in the survey was little changed during this 
period.  However, one- fifth of dealers  reported that most -favored hedge funds’  risk appetite had 
increased somewhat.7    
6 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repurchase agreements and similar secured 
financing transactions, not changes in the funding market itself.  This question is not asked with respect to 
equity markets in the core questions. 
7 The responses were broadly similar among broad -scope dealers.  The only exception was with 
regard to the risk appetite of insurance companies, for which one -third of broad- scope dealers reported an 
increase in appetite to bear investment risk since the beginning of 2012.

SPECIAL  QUESTION ON THIRD -PARTY CUSTODY OF  INDEPENDENT AMOUNTS  
(INITIAL  MARGIN )  AND COLLATERAL  
Following the  failure of MF Global in O ctober, market participants have reportedly  
focused more intensively on the possible consequences of  financial distress on  the part of dealers 
with whom they ha ve  posted collateral.  A  special question  asked about  changes in the past six  
months in the  intensity of efforts by respondents’ clients to negotiate arrangements for the 
custody by third parties of  collateral and margin posted with the  respondent’s  institution as  a risk  
mitigant.  About two -thirds of dealers, on net, pointed to an increase in such e fforts, with a few  
respondents noting that these efforts had  increased  considerably.    
SPECIAL  QUESTIONS ON DEVELOPMENTS IN  SECURITIES  LENDING  
During the 2007–08 financial crisis, some beneficial owners of securities (for  example,  
pension funds or  insurance companies) experienced losses related to  the  reinvestment of cash  
collateral posted by borrowers of their securities, which highlighted the associated counte rparty 
risk faced by the borrowers posting collateral.8  Since the crisis, the volume of securities lending  
has decreased  considerably and cash collateral reinvestment practices are said to  have changed  
significantly, including through application of more -stringent investment guidelines for cash  
collateral by beneficial owners and the increased posting of other securities as noncash  
collateral.9   A final set of special questions asked dealers about recent developments in  securities 
lending.  
One-fourth of dealers reported that the amount of resources and attention devoted to the  
management of credit exposure related  to their posting of collateral  with beneficial owners   
pursuant to securities borrowed (to facilitate  their own  trading activities or on behalf o f prime  
brokerage or other clients)  had increased over the past  six months. 10   Survey  responses indicated  
significant heterogeneity in the share of dollar volume of collateral posted pursuant to  securities 
borrowed  that consisted  of cash collateral as of  the beginning of 2012.  About one-half of dealers  
8 During some periods, and notably prior to the 2007– 08 financial crisis, the prospect of 
investment income on cash collateral posted with beneficial owners by borrowers of securities has 
represented a significant share of the return to beneficial owners for lending securities.  The investment 
decisions related to cash collateral, and associated liquidity and credit risks, are borne by the beneficial 
owners, who are obliga ted to return the cash collateral to the borrowers of securities when the securities are 
returned.  In general, the borrower has the right to return the securities and demand the cash collateral posted at any time.  The borrower of securities faces counter party risk from the transaction and potential 
losses in the event that the borrowed securities decline in value and the beneficial owner is unable to return 
the cash collateral, for example, because of losses stemming from its reinvestment. 
9 In an environment of comparatively low yields on reinvested cash and more -stringent investment 
guidelines, the historical preference in U.S. markets for cash collateral, with its capacity to generate returns 
for beneficial owners through reinvestment, may be subject to reconsideration. 
10 Dealers commonly borrow securities in circumstances where prime brokerage clients wish to 
establish short positions.  They also borrow to facilitate their own routine market -making activities, for 
example, to enable a delivery to a client on a securities sale when another client has failed to deliver the 
instrument to the dealer.

indicated that cash accounted for more than 80 percent of collateral posted pursuant to such 
transactions.  Meanwhile, one-fourth of respondents noted that cash consisted of between 60 and 
70 percent of  collateral posted pursuant to securities borrowed and about one- fifth reported a  
share of  cash collateral of  less than 60 percent.   Of note, about one-sixth of dealers reported that  
the  share of  their collateral  posted pursuant  to securities borrowed, consistin g of  other securities 
rather than  cash, had increased somewhat over  the past six months.11

ers were also queried about  the sources of securities borrowed by their firm as of  the 
beginning of 2012.  Four-fifths of  respondents  reported that securities lending programs  
administered by custodian banks or other agents on behalf of beneficial owners  were the largest  
source, by volume, of borrowed securities; the remaining respondents pointed to their clients  
(typically  through rehypothecation) or direct  transactions with beneficial  owners.12   In response to 
a question about  changes over the past six months in the volume of securities borrowed by source 
type, one- fifth of respondents indicated that  the volume of  securities borrowed  from securities 
lending progr ams administered by custodian banks or other agents had decreased somewhat.   
Little to no change was reported with regard to securities borrowed through rehypothecation and direct transactio ns with beneficial owners.  
11 While the shares of cash collateral posted by broad -scope dealers as of the beginning of 2012 
were broadly similar to those of other firms, ab out one -third of the broad- scope dealers noted that the 
fraction of noncash collateral posted had increased over the past six months. 
12 Of note, all of the broad -scope dealers indicated that securities lending programs administered 
by custodian banks or other agents were the source that accounted for the greatest volume of securities 
borrowed to facilitate their own trading activities or on behalf of prime brokerage or other clients as of the 
beginning of 2012.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS   
To illustrate some of the  risks to the outlook, we construct  several  alternatives to  
the baseline projection using simulations of staff  models.  T he first scenario  examines the  
downside risk t hat  consumer and business confidence remain subdued, contributing to a  
persistently  slow pace of  overall economic activity  that turns  the current , slow recovery  
into a “lost decade. ”  The second  scenario  considers the upside risk t hat  the  recent  
favorable  news  from the  labor market  and other economic indicators is an early sign  that 
the recovery  will accelerate  more rapidly than anticipated .  The third  scenario builds on 
the previous one by assuming that, in the context of  a faster recovery , the expanded size  
of  the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet could cause  inflation expectations  to rise .  In  
contrast , the fourth scenario considers the  possibility that inflation will decline by more  
than we anticipate  because the persistently  wide margins  of slack in labor  and product  
markets  could put downward pressure on inflation expectations, along the  lines of the  
predictions of accelerationist Phillips curve models.  The fifth and sixth scenarios analyze 
risks to the U.S. economic outlook associated with Europe’s  fiscal and financial 
situation —a severe  financial crisis and recession in Europe that spills over  to the U.S. and 
the global  economy, and, in contrast, a faster resolution of Europe’s problems.  Finally , 
the last  scenario considers  the effects of  a sharp rise in oil prices driven by  geopolitical 
tensions and supply disruptions.   
We generated the first four scenarios using the  FRB/US model  and an estimated  
policy rule  for the  federal funds rate  that responds  to core PCE inflation and a measure of  
economic slack based on the staff’s estimate of potential output.  T he last three s  cenarios  
were generated using the  multicountry SIGMA model and a  different policy rule that 
employs an alternative  concept of resource utilization.1   In all of the scenarios, the size 
and composition of the SOMA portfolio are  assumed to follow their baseline paths.  
1 In the simulations using the FRB/US model, the federal funds rate follows the outcome -based 
rule described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B. In the simulations using SIGMA, the policy rule 
is broadly similar, but uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the 
model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of a slow adjustment in wages and 
prices.

Lost Decade  
Our baseline forecast depends importantly on further steady improvements in 
consumer and business  confidence, the  willingness of firms to hire, the availability of  
credit, and the balance sheet positions of households and financial institutions.  In this  
scenario, these improvements are slower to materialize than in the baseline , caus ing  the 
pace of the recovery to remain sluggish.  Moreover, the persistently slow growth in 
spending a  nd output keeps the unemployment  rate elevated  for many years,  and the ski lls  
and labor force  attachment of unemployed workers erode more than in the  baseline.  
Specifically , the downward trend in labor force participation  is steeper than in the  
baseline  while  the NAIRU  edges up  to 6¼ percent by 2014 and thereafter  declines  
slow ly, leaving it ¼ percentage point above its path in the  baseline, on average.  In all, 
the growth rate of  potential output  increases  about ¼ percentage point  less per year  
through 2016.  Under these conditions, real GDP  rises  at an  average  annual  rate of a little  
more than 2 percent  through the middle of  the decade.  With  the expansion in aggregate 
demand little different  from  that of potential output, the unemployment rate  stays  near  its  
current  level  through 2015.  As a result , headline inflation eventua lly falls  below  
1½ percent  despite the corrosive effects  on the  labor market .  With real activity so weak  
and inflation so low, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound through 2016. 
Virtuous Circle   
Overall, we interpret recent indicators as consistent with a gradual strengthening  
in real activity this  year  and next.  But the improvement in labor market conditions, gains  
in industrial production, and sales of motor vehicles have been appreciably stronger than we expected,  raising  the possibility  that a more robust recovery may be under way.  In  
particular , this scenario assumes that a stronger mutually  reinforcing cycle emerges , with  
increasing  optimism and reduced aversion to risk  leading to  higher  consumer  
expenditures, more hiring and investment spending by firms, and improved credit  
availability and overall financial conditions.  This virtuous circle causes r eal GDP  to rise 
at an  annual rate of  about 3½ percent  in the second half of this  year  and 4½ percent  in 
2013, bringing the unemployment rate down to 7 percent by the end of next  year, about  
¾ percentage point below baseline.  Upward pressure on inflation is  initially  tempered by  
the effect of the higher level of capital investment  on labor productivity and  unit la bor  
costs , along with well -anchored long-run inflation expectations.  Over time, however,

tighter labor and product markets cause inflation to move above baseline.  In response to 
the stronger pace of real activity , the federal funds rate begins to rise  late thi s year .  
Virtuous Circle with Higher Inflation   
In the previous scenario, we assumed that long- run  inflation expectations  would 
remain well anchored despite a rapid  acceleration  in real  economic  activity.   However, in 
the context of a faster  recovery,  the unprecedented size of the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet  and the excess reserves  held by banks  could fuel an expansion in loan demand large 
enough to spark concerns about the ability of monetary policy to react in a timely manner  
to keep inflation pressures in check.  Reflecting these concerns, this scenario  builds on 
the previous one by assuming that long-run inflation expectations  rise to 2¾ percent b y 
the end  of  next year , causing  headline  inflation  to reach  2¾ percent  by 2015.  In response  
to higher inflation, the federal funds rate rises more steeply  and, on average , is about  
60 basis points above its level in the previous scenario.  With tighter mo netary policy, 
real activity by mid -decade is restrained  relative to the preceding scenario , and the  
unemployment rate  ends up ½ percentage point higher by the end of 2016.  
Disinflation  
The stability of various measures  of  expected inflation may be misle ading us  
about the potential for further disinflation, particularly in the  context of a baseline  
outlook in which a considerable margin of slack in labor and product markets persists for  
some time.   In this scenario, both expected and actual inflation drift down over ti me, with  
headline inflation falling  to about ½ percent  by 201 4; such declines would be in line with 
the predictions of some accelerationist Phillips curve  models.  As  inflation slows , 
financial market participants  become increasingly concerned that  the economy could fall  
into a  persistent  deflation; as a result, bond premiums  increase, which restrains spending  
modestly and raises  unemployment relative to baseline.   In response to lower inflation 
and greater economic slack, the federal funds  rate remains at its effective lower bound  
until the middle of  2016.  
European Crisis with  Severe Spillovers  
In this scenario, the recent improvements seen in European financial markets are 
assumed to be short lived, and Europe plunges into another bout  of severe  stress.  This 
outcome could result from  a disorderly  sovereign default , the  failure of a large European

financial institution , or a loss of confidence by the public in the ability of European 
governments to resolve the crisis.  Reflecting this  stress, both sovereign and private  
borrowing costs in Europe soar, with corporate bond spreads rising 400 basis points  
above baseline, and the confidence of households  and businesses plummets.  R eal GDP  
in Europe  declines  more  than 8 percent  relative to  baseline by the  end  of 201 3, 
notwithstanding a 20 percent  depreciation in the real effective foreign exchange value of 
the euro.  Europe’s difficulties are assumed to have important financial and economic  
spillovers to other parts of the world, including the United States.  
 U.S. economic activity  contracts sharply in response to U.S. corporate bond 
spreads widening by more than 300 basis points , a much weaker stock market, reduced  
access to credit,  and decreases in  household and business confidence.  In addition, weaker  
foreign  economic  activity  and the stronger  exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net  
exports.  All told, U.S. r eal  GDP  declines  at an  annual rate of 2 ½ percent  in the second 
half of this  year and  falls  a further 1½ percent in 2013.  The unemployment rate climbs to 
10¾ percent in 2014 before  gradually  receding.  With substantially  greater resource slack  
and  lower import prices, overall U.S. consumer price inflation dips below zero in the 
second half of 2012 and in 2013; inflation finally turns positive in 2014 as economic  
recovery begins to take hold.2   Under these  conditions, t he federal funds rate remains  
near zero  until the second half of 2016.  
Faster European Recovery  
In our baseline projection, European financial conditions continue to improve, 
albeit at a more gradual pace than seen during the past few months.  However, it is  
possible that credit conditions in Europe will ease  faster than expected and that rising  
business and household confidence will spur a  faster recovery.  In this scenario, European 
sovereign and private-sector borrowing costs are assumed to decline considerably, with 
corporate bond spreads falling roughly 100 basis  points by the end of this  year; household 
and business sentiment also improve markedly.  As a result, real GDP in Europe rises  
1¼ percent this  year, rather than contracting slightly as in the baseline, and  then increases  
2¾ percent in 2013.  U.S. real net exports are boosted by stronger economic activity in 
2 The rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects the forward -looki ng 
nature of inflation determination in SIGMA.  In particular, long -run inflation expectations remain firmly 
anchored at 2 percent, producer marginal costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, and 
productivity is weaker (reflecting reduced capital spending).  In addition, import price inflation runs 
significantly higher than in the baseline as the dollar’s initial appreciation is gradually reversed.  Under alternative specifications of SIGMA that, for instance, allow for more structural persistence in the inflation 
process or a less -firm anchoring of inflation expectations, inflation would remain low for a longer period.

Europe and in other  U.S. trading partners, as well  as by  a depreciation of the dollar as  
monetary accommodation abroad is removed somewhat earl ier.   All told, U.S. real GDP  
rises about 3 percent  on average over the next two years, the unemployment rate falls to  
7½ percent by  the  end of  2013, and inflation increases to nearly 2 percent in 2012 and 
2013.  Under these  conditions, the federal  funds rate begins to rise somewhat earlier than 
in the baseline.   
Higher Oil Prices  
The recent tension with Iran over its nuclear program highlights the significant  
upside risks to our outlook for oil prices.  In thi s scenario, we assume that  geopolitical  
events temporarily drive  oil prices $50 per barrel  above baseline in the second quarter of  
this  year but that oil prices gradually recede thereafter.  Although a supply-driven 
increase in oil prices would ordinarily  be expected  to cause the dollar to depreciate,  we 
assume instead that heightened geopolitical tensions increase the demand for   
dollar-denominated assets and cause the dollar to appreciate slightly.  U.S. domestic  
demand falls relative to baseline because h igher oil prices reduce households’ real  
incomes and lower the return on firms’ investments, and real  exports also decline due to 
weaker foreign economic activity.  All told, U.S. real GDP rises only about 2 percent, on 
average, this  year  and next, and the unemployment rate remains elevated, ending 2013 at  
8¼ percent, ½  percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Reflecting the  rise in energy  
costs, overall PCE inflation jumps to nearly 3½ percent this  year but then moderates  as  
oil prices begin to slowl y decline.  Core inflation increases to nearly 2  percent by next  
year as  firms pass on their higher production costs to consumers.  Although the liftoff of  
the federal funds rate is unchanged from baseline, the removal of monetary  
accommodation thereafter  proceeds a bit more  gradually.  
OUTSIDE  FORECASTS  
The latest Blue Chip survey  was released on February 10, and thus is quite stale.  
We should receive the March survey later this week; accordingly,  we  will circulate  
material comparing our projection with  the Blue Chip consensus at that time.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
