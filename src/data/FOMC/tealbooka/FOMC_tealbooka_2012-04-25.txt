Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The data we have received since the March Tealbook suggest a slightly stronger 
pace of economic activity, on average, during th e first half of this year than we had 
previously projected.  Most importantly, the une mployment rate is a lit tle lower, the level 
of overall payroll employment a little higher,  and consumer spendi ng noticeably stronger 
than we had expected.  That said, personal in come appears to be on a weaker trajectory 
than we had projected in the March Tealbook, the trade data for January and February 
were slightly disappointing on net, and the bump to defense spending early this year 
seems likely to be unwound over the next few qua rters.  Moreover, we are mindful of the 
possibility that the recent spending a nd production data have been boosted by 
unseasonably warm weather and seasonal adju stment problems—a consideration that 
dissuaded us from marking up the near-term projection more noticeably.  After taking all 
of this information into account, we now es timate that real GDP will increase at an 
annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first half of this year, ¼ pe rcentage point more than in 
the March Tealbook. 
With most of the key background factors sh aping our forecast little revised, the 
broad contour of our projection is similar to th at in the previous Tealbook.  In particular, 
we expect real GDP to expand at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the second half of 2012 
and then to remain at that pace in 2013, as th e impetus to growth from favorable financial 
conditions, an improving credit environment,  and rising confidence is offset by a 
significant tightening in the stan ce of fiscal policy.  In 2014, GDP growth is projected to 
pick up to 3¼ percent as the drag from fi scal policy begins to recede.  Given the 
projected path for GDP, the unemployment rate is forecast to fall from 8¼ percent in the 
current quarter to 7½ percent by the end of 2014; the path of the joble ss rate is a little  
lower than in the March Tealbook, mostly re flecting the lower-than-expected readings 
seen in recent months.   
We have nudged up our forecast for infla tion relative to the March Tealbook in 
response to higher-than-expected data on core consumer prices and the slightly narrower 
margin of slack in this projection.  We now  expect core PCE price inflation to be 
1.8 percent in 2012 and 1.7 percent in 2013 and 2014, 0.1 percentage point above our 
previous projection in each year.  With the passthrough of the recent run-up in oil prices 
into consumer energy prices nearly complete and with oil prices expected to edge lower

 from current levels, headline PCE inflation is  projected to slow fr om 2½ percent in the 
first quarter to an average of 1¾ percent in the remainder of 2012 and then to be 
1½ percent in 2013 and 2014. 
The box “Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP” compares the 
current Tealbook projection with  the one in the January T ealbook, which corresponds to 
the last time Committee participants submitted their economic projections. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
In line with the staff’s outcome-based po licy rule, we assume that liftoff of the 
target federal funds rate from its effective lower bound will occur in the first quarter of 
2014, one quarter earlier than in the March Te albook.  At the same time, we assume that 
the Committee will maintain the Federal Reserv e’s current portfolio-related policies, with 
the timing adjusted in line with the revised liftoff date. 
The path of the federal funds rate in the extended baseline projection, and in 
particular the date when conventional monetary  policy is assumed to begin to firm in the 
staff projection, depends impor tantly on our use of the estimated outcome-based policy 
rule.  As discussed in Book B, liftoff would occu r in the same quarter as in the baseline if 
we had instead assumed that the federal funds rate would follow the prescriptions of the 
Taylor (1999) rule.  But usi ng a rule that targets the leve l of nominal GDP would delay 
the onset of conventional tightening until la te 2014, and optimal-policy calculations 
indicate postponing it until mid-2015.  In contra st, the Taylor (1993) rule would call for a 
higher federal funds rate right away, while  the first-difference rule would call for 
tightening to begin in the second half of 2013.1 
Other Interest Rates 
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities  has changed little, on net, since the 
March Tealbook.  We expect the 10-year Treasur y yield to rise substantially from the 
middle of this year through 2013 and end that  year at 3¾ percent—1¾ percentage points 
above its current level and a bout 10 basis points higher than in the March projection.  In 
2014, the yield is projected to increase an a dditional 15 basis points.   This projection 
                                                 
1 All these estimates allow for dynamic feedback from the stance of moneta ry policy to the real 
economy and inflation, which can have important implications for the estimated timing of tightening under 
the different rules.

 Revisions  to the Staff Projection  since  the Previous  SEP 
The FOMC  published  its most recent Survey of Economic  Projections  (SEP) following  the 
January FOMC meeting.   The table  below summarizes  revisions  to the staff economic  
projection  since the January  Tealbook.   
The staff projection  for real GDP growth has strengthened,  on net, since January,  with 
most of the revisions  occurring  in the March Tealbook.  The  revisions  mainly reflect 
stronger incoming  spending  data, primarily  affecting  the first half of 2012, and revisions  to 
the assumptions  for equity  prices, the exchange  rate, and foreign growth that affect the 
projection  throughout  the medium term.  The lower projected  unemployment  rate 
reflects both the stronger  outlook for aggregate  demand and incoming  data that leave 
the unemployment  rate jumping  off from a lower level than we  had anticipated  in January.    
The staff projection  for core PCE inflation has  revised up  about ¼ percentage point  per 
year since January, the  result of both incoming  data and the stronger  projection  for real 
activity.  The revision to ov erall PCE inflation also reflects the rise since January  in crude oil 
prices, but with  our oil price projection  now sloping more noticeably  downward, overall  
PCE inflation is currently  projected  to run a little below  core inflation in 2013 and 2014.    
With these changes  to the economic  outlook,  the outcome ‐based policy rule now calls for 
the federal funds rate to move  above its  effective lower bound  in the first quarter of 2014, 
three quarters  earlier than  was the case in the January Tealbook.

 reflects the movement of the valuation wi ndow through the period of near-zero short-
term interest rates, a grad ual waning of the effects of nonconventional monetary policy, 
and further unwinding of safe-haven demands as apprehensions related to the European 
debt crisis abate and the durability of the U.S. economic recovery becomes more assured. 
Since the March Tealbook was publishe d, spreads over comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities for BBB-rated corporat e bonds and conforming fixed-rate mortgages 
are about unchanged, on net.  Still, both spr eads are currently  above their typical levels 
and are expected to narrow gradually over the medium term.  Given our forecast of 
Treasury yields, these assumptions imply that  yields on these private instruments are 
projected to increase moderately over the next three years.    
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
Broad U.S. stock price indexes have incr eased about 3 percent,  on net, since the 
March Tealbook.  We now project th at stock prices will rise at an annual rate of about 
7 percent, on average, through the fourth  quarter of 2014.  The projected pace of 
appreciation from here forward continues to reflect our expectation of a gradual decline 
in the equity premium from hi storically elevated levels.  
The CoreLogic house price index increased in January and February, whereas we 
had expected it to continue drifting down a b it further.  In response, we have revised up 
our forecast for house prices noticeably and now forecast that they will rise about 
2 percent in both 2012 and 2013, putting the proj ected level of house prices by late 2013 
roughly 5 percent higher than in the March Tealbook; we project a further 2 percent 
increase in 2014.  This projection also refl ects our continued expect ation that mortgage 
rates will remain low enough a nd rents will remain high enough to provide some support 
for house prices despite the countervailing eff ects of tight underwriting standards and the 
large stock of properties in the foreclosure pipeline that will only decline gradually.   
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are essentially unchanged in this forecast and 
continue to imply that federal fiscal polic y will impart a noticeable drag on activity over 
the medium term.  In particular, we still assume that the payroll tax cut and the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC ) program will expire next year as 
scheduled under current law.  We also con tinue to assume that federal discretionary 
spending will be restrained this year by the caps set in the Budget Control Act.  The

 additional restraint imparted by the automatic spending cuts stipulated by that legislation 
to take effect in January 2013 is assumed to be replaced by more-gradual budget restraint 
that achieves the same amount of cumulative deficit reduction thr ough fiscal year 2021.  
Given these assumptions for federal policy, and also folding in the effects of state and 
local policies, we expect total fiscal policy to directly restrain real GDP growth 
(excluding multiplier effects) by ¼ percentage point this year, 1 percentage point in 2013, 
and ¼ percentage point in 2014. 
We project that the federal budget defi cit will narrow from $1.3 trillion 
(8¾ percent of GDP) last year to about $700 billion (4 percent of GDP) in fiscal 2014.  
As in the March Tealbook, the expected na rrowing of the deficit reflects the winding 
down of stimulus policies, spending rest raint from the Budget Control Act and the 
drawdown of overseas military op erations, and the effects of th e pickup in the pace of the 
recovery on tax receipts. 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Real activity in the foreign economies incr eased at an estimat ed annual rate of 
3¼ percent in the first quarter,  up from only 1¼ percent in th e fourth quarter.  Much of 
the step-up in growth reflected the normaliza tion of supply chains in emerging Asia that 
were disrupted by the floods in Thailand last year.  Over the remainder of 2012, foreign 
real GDP is expected to rise at about a 3 percent pace, as euro-area output continues to 
contract in response to financial stress and fi scal retrenchment but the rest of the global 
economy generally expands at a moderate pace.  Beyond 2012, we expect foreign GDP 
growth to gradually inch higher and reach  3½ percent by 2014, helped by continued 
accommodative monetary policy, a firming U.S. recovery, and the easing of financial 
stresses in Europe.  
Since the March Tealbook, the dollar has edged up.  From its slightly higher 
starting point, we expect the broad real dollar to depreciate  at about a 2¼ percent annual 
rate through the end of 2014, little  changed from our previous projection.  As before, we 
assume that the bulk of this depreciation will be against the currencies of emerging market economies. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
Spot prices for major benchmark grades of crude oil have declined in recent 
weeks, likely because of increased concerns about the strength of near-term global

 demand.  The spot price of Brent crude o il closed on April 17 at  $119 per barrel, down 
$5 since the time of the March Tealbook.2  Brent futures prices also generally moved 
lower, but these declines were not as large as  the drop in the spot pr ice.  That said, the 
futures curve still slopes down, with spot pr ices commanding a nearly $15 premium over 
the price of futures for the end of 2014.  Accord ingly, market participan ts appear to view 
the current high level of prices  as temporary.  Our forecast for the price of imported oil 
has shifted down in line with futures prices.  We anticipate the price of imported oil will 
edge down from an estimated value of $111 per barrel in March to $109 per barrel at the 
end of this year before dec lining to just over $100 per ba rrel at the end of 2014, a bit 
below the level projected in the March Tealbook. 
Nonfuel commodity prices have genera lly edged down since the March Tealbook.  
As with oil, the lower prices likely reflect  increased concern regarding global growth 
prospects and, in particular, rising concern about the strength of Chinese demand.  An 
exception has been soybeans, for which prices  continue to be boosted by concerns about 
growing conditions in South America.  We project that nonfuel commodity prices will 
remain about flat over the remainder of th e projection period, a forecast in line with 
quotes from futures markets.  
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
We now estimate that real GDP will rise at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the 
first quarter of this year, ¾ percentage point above our previous projection.  The upward 
revision to output growth mostly reflects a co mbination of larger-than-expected increases 
in consumer outlays in the first quarter and a higher level of government purchases than 
we had forecast previously; inventory investment has also surprised us thus far this year 
by running at about the same robust pace as late  last year.  In addition, the February and 
March readings on the labor market, taken together, were a little better than our 
projection in the March Tealbook.  When puttin g together our projection for the second 
quarter, we balanced the favorable developments in the first quarter against the 
implications for household spending of w eaker-than-expected personal income, the 
likelihood that the contributi ons to growth from both government spending and 
inventories will prove transitory, and some  recent softening in regional and national 
                                                 
2 The spot price of WTI crude oil closed on April 17 at $104 per barrel, about $3 lower than at the 
time of the March Tealbook.

 surveys of business sentiment.  All told, our  projection for second-qua rter GDP growth is 
little revised at ju st over 2 percent. 
The Labor Market 
The labor market continues to improve.  Although private payroll employment 
rose only 120,000 in March, that increase followed gains averaging 250,000 in the 
preceding three months.  Part of the step-down in March may represent a waning lift to 
employment provided by unseasonably warm we ather in recent months, and part may 
reflect seasonal adjustment problems tied to th e fact that the steepest part of the collapse 
in payrolls during the recent recession occurr ed during the winter months.  We think that 
the underlying pace of employment growth over the past few months—after adjusting for 
weather and seasonal effects—was probabl y something closer to 200,000 per month. 
The unemployment rate edged down in March to 8.2 percent, extending its 
decline since August.  Meanwhile , other indicators of labor market activity have either 
held steady or improved since the March Te albook:  Initial claims for unemployment 
insurance have changed little, on balance,  in recent weeks after falling for several 
months, the improvements seen earlier this  year in consumer expectations for 
employment and unemployment have been maintained, and measures of job openings 
have increased in recent months.  
During the second quarter, we expect priv ate payroll employment to increase 
175,000 per month, roughly in line with the modest  pace of increase in real activity and 
the same as in the March Tealbook.  We ha ve taken on board the improvement in the 
unemployment rate in recent months, and we e xpect the jobless rate to hold steady at 
8.2 percent throughout the second quarter.     
The Industrial Sector 
Activity in the industrial sector posted a robust gain in the first quarter.  Total 
industrial production is estimated to have increas ed at an annual rate of 5½ percent, as 
weather-induced declines in the output of mines and utilities were more than offset by an 
acceleration in manufacturing output to an annual rate of more than 10 percent.3  In the 
motor vehicle sector, light vehicle assemblie s jumped nearly 900,000 units to an annual 
                                                 
3 On March 30, the Federal Reserve published its annual revision of industrial production and 
capacity utilization.  In the aggregate, the contour of industrial production was little changed from its 
previous estimate and recent u tilization rates were little revised.

 rate of 9.8 million units in the first quarter and are sche duled to rise further to a 
10.2 million unit pace in the second quarter.  Elsewhere in manufacturing, production 
gains have been widespread across industr ies.  Looking ahead, national and regional 
manufacturing surveys point to continued gains in factory production, but at a more 
moderate pace than in the firs t quarter.  All told, we exp ect growth in manufacturing 
output to slow to a 4 percent pace in the curr ent quarter.  For the first half of 2012 as a 
whole, the projected gain in manufacturi ng production is about 1¼ percentage points 
faster than what we had e xpected in the March Tealbook. 
Household Spending 
We now estimate that real PCE rose at an  annual rate of 2¼ pe rcent in the first 
quarter, a full percentage point faster than in the March projection.  This upward revision 
aligns real consumer spending more closely with the strong ri se in equity prices and the 
gradual improvement in sentiment that we have  seen since last fall.  With the exception 
of energy services, where unseasonably warm  weather has held down outlays, spending 
increases have been widespread.  However, because the stronger incoming data on 
spending in the first quarter were accompa nied by weaker-than-e xpected news about 
personal income, we have made very little further adjustment to our projection of real 
PCE in the near term.  As in our previous proj ection, we expect real PCE to increase at an 
annual rate of 2½ percent in the second quarter.   
 Although the recent data on housing activity have been a little stronger than we 
had expected, we suspect that much of the upside surprise reflect s the unusually warm 
winter.  Single-family housing starts topped 500,000 units at an annual rate in December 
and January, but starts then fell back to a pace of about 460,000 units in February and 
March.  By contrast, permits—which provide  a better gauge of the underlying pace of 
new construction and, in particular, are le ss sensitive to weather anomalies—have 
increased more gradually over the past year .  Meanwhile, housing demand appears to be 
improving slowly from very depressed levels :  Existing home sales have continued to 
edge up in recent months, and house prices have firmed.  Still, much of the purchase 
demand that does exist continues to be channele d to the still-abundant stock of relatively 
inexpensive vacant houses, thereby limiting de mand for new homes.  As a result, we 
expect single-family starts to average about 470,000 units in the coming months, the same as in the March Tealbook and up just a littl e from the level of st arts that prevailed 
before the onset of unseasonably warm weathe r in December.  In the multifamily sector, 
starts have trended up over the past year or so  from very low levels in response to rising

 rents and falling vacancy rates,  and we expect further moderate gains in coming months.  
In all, we now estimate that residential invest ment rose at an annual rate of 18 percent in 
the first quarter, and we expect it to rise 12 percent this quarter.    
Business Investment  
The growth of real spending on equipmen t and software (E&S) is estimated to 
have slowed to an annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarte r, but we expect outlays to 
rise more rapidly in the current quarter.  Weighting the series for different equipment 
types by their importance in business invest ment, orders for nondefense capital goods 
rose more than 4 percent over the past three mont hs (not at an annual rate).  In addition, a 
number of other forward-looking indicators of business ou tlays, including surveys of 
capital spending plans and an alysts’ earnings expectations  for companies that produce 
capital goods, now stand at levels consistent  with some acceleration.  In light of these 
indicators, we project that real E&S will increa se at an annual rate of 8½ percent in the 
current quarter. 
After showing surprising streng th through much of 2011, outlays on 
nonresidential construction have softened not iceably in recent months, leading us to 
project that real investment in nonresidentia l structures (excluding drilling and mining) 
will decline at an annual rate of about 3½ percent over the firs t half of this year.  The 
deceleration is in line with the sector’s fundamentals.  Although there are hints that 
commercial real estate financing conditions  have begun to ease somewhat, high vacancy 
rates and low sales prices continue to put downward pressure on bui lding activity.  After 
brisk increases in each of the past two years,  investment in the drilling and mining sector 
is expected to rise at a more moderate pace in the first half of this year.  The high price of 
oil should continue to spur i nvestment in this sector, whil e low natural gas prices have 
caused the number of natural gas rigs in operation to fall off noticeably in recent months. 
Since rebounding sharply in the fourth quarter, real nonfarm inventories appear to 
have increased at roughly the same pace in the first quarter.  The staff’s flow-of-goods 
system, as well as private surveys of inve ntory satisfaction and plans, suggest that 
inventories (excluding motor ve hicles) are generally well al igned with sales, and book-
value inventory-to-sales ratios remain near pre-recession norms.  But with producers 
anticipated to remain vigilant against the possibility of unwanted accumulations, we 
expect stockbuilding outside of motor vehicles to proceed at a slightly slower pace in the 
current quarter.  In contrast, motor vehicle stocks remain relatively lean, and the step-up

 in assembly plans this quarter suggests that  automakers are aiming to boost inventories 
by enough to raise days’ supply of light vehicl es to more comfortable levels in the 
coming months.  On net, inventory investment is  anticipated to subtract slightly from real 
GDP growth over the first half of this year.   
Government  
Real federal purchases fell at an annual ra te of 7 percent in the fourth quarter, led 
by a drop in defense outlays, and we had exp ected another decline—albeit at a slower 
rate—in the first quarter.  However, spendi ng data available thr ough March suggest that 
total real federal expenditures actually edged up last quarter.  In th e current quarter, we 
expect real federal purchases to fall back  toward a level more consistent with budget 
appropriations.  In the state and local sector , the incoming information suggests that real 
purchases by these governments may be finally bottoming out:  State and local 
employment edged up in the first quarter fo r the first time since 2008, while their real 
construction spending declined only slightly.  All told, real state a nd local purchases are 
projected to be essentially flat in the coming months. 
Foreign Trade  
Real exports of goods and services are exp ected to increase at an average annual 
rate of about 6 percent in the first half of 2012, buoyed by robust growth in the emerging 
market economies.  This projection is a little lower than in the March Tealbook on account of weaker-than-expected trade data  for January and February.  Imports are 
projected to rise at a 3¾ per cent pace in the first half of  the year, about ¾ percentage 
point faster than we had expected in the previous Tealbook, largely reflecting the 
surprising strength of January imports.  Overall,  net exports are expected to add a little 
less than ¼ percentage point to GDP growth in the first half, about  ¼ percentage point 
lower than in the March Tealbook.  
Prices and Wages  
We now project that PCE prices increased at an annual rate of  2½ percent in the 
first quarter—nearly ½ percentage point fast er than expected in the March Tealbook— 
with the upward revision mos tly attributable to higher-than -expected core PCE inflation.  
As for the second quarter, the latest readings  on crude oil and gaso line point to a large 
deceleration in consumer energy prices, whic h has led us to lower our second-quarter 
estimate for overall inflation to just over 1½ percent.  On balance, PCE inflation is little changed in the first half of this year  relative to our previous projection.

 Core PCE prices were revised up noticeably in January and are estimated to have 
increased slightly faster in February a nd March than we had assumed in the March 
Tealbook; as a result, core inflation is now projected at 2.2 percent in  the first quarter, 
nearly ½ percentage point above our previous estimate.  Roughly half of the first-quarter 
surprise was due to an upward revision to nonm arket prices; historica lly, price inflation in 
this category has displayed little persistence.  Changes in market-based prices were also 
slightly larger than expected in the first quarter, primarily reflecting revisions to the 
January data on medical servic es prices; however, the latest information suggests that 
market-based inflation over the remainder of  the quarter remained fairly close to our 
expectation in the March Tealbook.  As a result , we now estimate that core PCE inflation 
will run at a 1.8 percent pace in the second qua rter, only a tenth higher than our previous 
projection. 
The only new data on labor compensation since the previous  Tealbook were the 
readings on average hourly earnings in Februa ry and March, which were in line with our 
expectations.  Consequently, we continue to expect that the increase in the Productivity 
and Costs measure of nonfarm hourly compensa tion will average an a nnual rate of about 
2¼ percent in the first half of 2012, th e same as in the March Tealbook.   
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
The broad contour of the medium-term pr ojection is the same as in the March 
Tealbook.  In particular, we continue to pr oject an acceleration in real GDP over the 
forecast period, with the recovery supported by favorable financial conditions, improving 
credit availability, and rising confidence in the durability of the expansion.  That said, we 
continue to anticipate the pic kup in aggregate demand to be re latively mild by historical 
standards because of a number of importa nt headwinds, including ongoing concerns 
about the European situation, a slow pace of  improvement in the housing market, and a 
restrictive stance of fiscal policy.  Indeed, even assuming that the 2001–03 tax cuts and 
most other expiring tax provisions are extende d beyond the end of this year, total fiscal 
policy is expected to directly restrain real  GDP growth by ¼ percen tage point this year 
and a full percentage point in 2013 before eas ing back to about ¼ percentage point in 
2014.  As a result, real GDP is projected to increase at an annual rate of 2¾ percent over 
the second half of 2012 and in 2013 before picking up to 3¼ percent in 2014.   
Part of the fiscal restraint in our forecast is reflected in falling government 
purchases.  In particular, real  federal expenditures are projec ted to decline 1¾ percent this

 year and then to fall more than 4 percent in both 2013 and 2014, owi ng to the effects of 
the Budget Control Act and the drawdown of overseas milita ry operations.  We expect 
real purchases by state and local governments to pick up only very slowly over the 
medium term, reflecting sluggish growth in their tax revenues.     
The large fiscal drag we expect next y ear shows through especially to our forecast 
for consumer spending.  In particular, the anti cipated expiration of th e payroll tax cut and 
EUC program at the end of 2012 imparts signi ficant restraint on the growth of real 
disposal personal income, offsetting some of the positive impetus from an improving labor market, rising confidence, and increases  in household wealth.  As a result, we 
project that real PCE will rise 2¾ percent in both 2012 and 2013 before picking up to 
3¼ percent in 2014.  The figures for 2012 and 2013 are about ¼ percentage point higher 
than in the March forecast, reflecting upward revisions to household wealth associated 
with the higher projected paths for equity and home prices.  
 As in previous Tealbooks, we expect  a very slow recovery in housing 
construction over the medium term.  Despite some encouraging signals from home sales 
and house prices, the underlying le vel of activity in this sect or remains deeply depressed, 
and exceedingly tight mortgage credit appears likely to weigh on the demand for housing 
for some time.  Moreover, the stock of vacant houses is still sizable, and we expect that 
the flow of homes from foreclosure into th e resale market will remain substantial, 
although it should diminish over time.  Accordin gly, our projection calls for single-family 
housing starts to rise only gradually next  year—reaching an annual rate of 580,000 units 
by the end of 2013—and then to pick up at a slightly faster pace in 2014 as uncertainty 
and pessimism about the housing market dissipates further. 
In the business sector, we continue to expect that expenditures on E&S will rise 
modestly over the medium term.  Although firms have ample cash, many likely see little 
reason to expand capacity aggres sively in an environment of relatively sluggish demand 
for their products.  We project real E&S ou tlays to rise at an annual rate of roughly 
6 percent in the second half of 2012 and in 2013 and just slightly faster than that in 2014.  Consequently, we expect a relatively slow expansion in the cap ital stock.  (The box 
“Equipment and Software Spending duri ng the Recovery” provides additional 
background on the E&S projection.) 
Our outlook continues to anticipate a sluggish pace of investment in 
nonresidential structures.  Reflecting the w eak fundamentals cited earlier, structures

 Equipment  and Software  Spending  during the Recovery 
After declining  dramatically  during the recession,  real spending  on equipment and  
software  (E&S) rose rapidly early  in the recovery.  From  mid‐ 2009 through the end of 
2010, real E&S  spending  (the black line in the figure below) grew at an average  annual 
rate of nearly  15 percent—noticeably  more steeply than during the average postwar 
recovery (the red line), despite the relatively  modest rate of recovery  in overall activity.1  
In 2011, the  rate of increase in E&S investment  slowed to 9 percent but remained  solid.  
With these increases, the level of  E&S investment  regained  its pre‐recession peak  late last 
year.  In this regard, E&S contrasts  sharply with both  residential  and nonresidential  
structures  investment  (not shown), which also  experienced  deep declines during the 
recession but have  yet to re cover appreciably.  
Of course,  E&S spending  normally  rebounds  rapidly following  a downturn as  firms 
respond to improvements  in sales prospects  and the relatively  low costs of borrowing  
that typify the onset of recovery.  Indeed, as  shown by  the red line in the figure on the 
next page, one of our standard  models based on business  output growth and the cost of 
capital would have predicted  a fairly swift turnaround  in investment  growth, despite the 
modest recovery in  output.   
 
 
  
                                                 
1 Note, however,  that low levels of investment  during  the recession  and early recovery combined 
with historically  high rates  of depreciation  to produce  unusually  weak growth in the E&S capital stock, 
which is more in keeping  with the modest pace of recovery in overall activity.  As a result, the level of the 
E&S capital stock remains  well  below its historical  trend.

 However, the  growth rate  of actual spending  (the black line) significantly  outpaced  the 
model prediction.   We have interpreted  this surprising  strength  largely as the release of 
pent‐up demand that had built up during the crisis and recession as  credit supply 
restrictions  and extraordinary  uncertainty  caused firms to defer  many investment  
projects.  Indeed, some  alternative  models that explicitly  incorporate the  low level of the 
capital stock, which may proxy for pent‐up demand,  predicted  a stronger  rebound  than 
our standard  models.  However, we  have had  little success in  quantifying  the magnitude 
of this pent‐ up demand with much precision,  and the atypically  brisk recovery in  E&S 
spending  might also have been driven by  other factors. 
Over the medium‐term forecast horizon, we expect only moderate increases  in E&S 
spending,  as sluggish sales growth provides  limited motivation  for firms  to expand  
capacity.  Although  we expect the  impetus to spending  from pent‐ up demand or other 
factors to persist,  we project that it  will wane in magnitude in  the coming years.  
Reflecting  this view, our  forecast for E&S growth is som ewhat above the predictions  of 
the model throughout  the forecast period, but the size  of this residual diminishes  over 
time (see the figure below).  All told, we expect E&S outlays, which contributed  about 
1 percentage point and  ¾ percentage point  to GDP growth in  2010 and 2011, respectively, 
to contribute  only about ½ percentage point in  each year  from 2012 to 2014. 
The spending  data that we have received  in recent months are consistent  with our 
projection  for a moderation  in the rate of increase in  capital expenditures  this year.  
However, considerable  uncertainty  attends our forecast.   Given our  limited 
understanding  of the factors that have driven spending  above our  model’s prediction,  
our forecast for their persistence is  largely judgmental.   Thus, there  are ample risks to  the 
forecast on both the upside and the downside.

 investment outside of drilling and mining is expe cted to be only a little better than flat 
over the next couple of years.  In contrast, outlays for drilling and mining structures are 
projected to rise modestly over the medium te rm, supported in part by high oil prices and 
the continued deployment of hor izontal drilling techniques. 
Real exports of goods and services are proj ected to increase at an annual rate of 
roughly 5½ percent in the second half of this year and in 2013 before picking up to a 
6½ percent pace in 2014, in line with the projected acceleration in foreign economic 
activity, as Europe slowly emerges from its recession.  Meanwhile, real imports are 
projected to rise at about a 4½ percent rate on average through 2014, supported by the 
growth of U.S. demand but tempered by dollar de preciation.  On net, trade is expected to 
make an essentially zero arithmetic contribu tion to real GDP growth in 2012 and in the 
subsequent two years.   
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU 
We made only small changes to our s upply-side assumptions this round.  The 
more substantial revisions we made last round were designed to bring the output and 
unemployment gaps into closer alignment w ith our understanding of the dynamics of 
employment during the recession.  Even so, th e first-quarter decline in the unemployment 
rate was somewhat larger than could be explained by our estimate of near-term output 
growth, leading us to make a small further downward adjustment to the past and projected level of potential output in th is forecast.  We continue to assume that potential 
output growth  will edge up from about 2 perc ent in 2012 to 2¼ percent in 2014, 
reflecting the projected increase in capita l accumulation.  In addition, we assume the 
NAIRU will remain at 6 percent thro ugh 2014, the same as in the March Tealbook.
4  (A 
longer perspective on staff estimates of economic capacity is provided in the box 
“Revisions to Measures of Economic Capacity.”) 
Productivity and the Labor Market 
Given the available data on hours worked and our estimate of real GDP growth, 
we now judge that labor producti vity edged down in the first quarter, bringing the level of 
productivity close to our estimate of its tre nd.  Over the remainder of the medium term, 
                                                 
4 Our estimate of the “effective” NAIRU, which includes the influence of extended and emergency 
benefits on the unemployment rate, is 6.3 percent in 2012:Q1.  As before, we expect the gap between the 
NAIRU and the effective NAIRU to  close by the middle of 2013.

 Revisions  to Measures  of Economic  Capacity  
The slow  pace of the recovery raises  the question  of whether  a significant  
portion of  the output  loss  inflicted by the recession and  financial crisis is 
permanent.   Although  we believe that the amount of economic  slack has been 
and remains substantial,  we have also marked down considerably  our 
assessment  of the capacity of the econ omy compared  with our  projection  in 
January 2008.1 
One way to measure  economic  capacity is in the labor market.  As shown in  the 
figure below, our current assumption  (which we  have held since late 2010)  is that 
the NAIRU (the solid red line) increased  from 5 percent  to 6 percent over 2008 
and 2009, on  the view that the mismatch between ava ilable jobs  and 
unemployed  workers likely  rose during the recession.   Over time,  we expect the 
NAIRU to retrace  most of that increase and  to fall to 5¼  percent by late 2017,  as a 
strengthening  labor market encourages  workers and  firms to make adjustments  
to improve  matching  and as some unemployed  indivi duals permanently  exit the 
labor force.  That ultimate  figure of 5¼ percent is ½ percentage point higher  than 
we had assumed  in 2008 (the  dashed red line), partly reflecting  permanent labor  
market scarring associated  with the extraordinarily  high level of long‐term 
unemployment.    
                                                 
1 This analysis uses the January 2008 Greenbook  as the point of comparison  because it 
was the first to include a long‐run forecast.   Although  that projection  reflected  the incipient 
economic  weakness,  the staff did not forecast a recession  and had not marked down potential  
GDP.  The  long‐run forecast presented  in the January 2008 Tealbook  ended in 2012; however,   
the staff created a projection  beyond 2012  for use in the optimal‐control exercises  reported  in 
the Bluebook.   For this analysis, the January 2008 assumptions  for the NAIRU, potential  GDP, 
and structural  labor productivity  beyond 2012  are taken from this longer‐run projection.

 Additionally,  we have lowered our assumption  about the trend labor force, 
reflecting  a net downward  revision to the working ‐age population  in recent years 
and surprisingly  weak readings on the  labor force participation  rate (LFPR).  
Although  we think much of the decline in the LFPR reflects cyclical and other 
factors, we  also view it as suggesting  that the downtr end in participation  has 
been somewhat  steeper than  we had previously  assumed  and so marked down 
our trend participation  rate a bit beginning  in 2009 in response  (not shown). 
Another way to measure  economic  capacity is potential  GDP, shown by  the red 
lines in the lower‐left figur e.  We now estimate  that the level of potential  GDP at 
the end of 2011 was nearly 4 percent lower than  in our January 2008 projection.   
By way of comparison,  the actual level of GDP at the end  of 2011 came  in about 
8 percent lower than  our 2008 forecast.  
A decomposition  of potential  GDP can help  provide insight about  the sources of 
the revision.   In the staff’s accounting,  potential  GDP comprises  trend labor input 
and structural  labor productivity.   Much of  the downward  revision to our  
estimate of potential  GDP through 2011  reflects lower trend  labor input—in 
particular,  the revisions  to our assumptions  about the NAIRU  and the trend labor 
force discussed  earlier.  In  addition,  we revised down  our estimate  of structural  
productivity  growth, shown in  the lower‐ right figure.  Some  of the downward  
revision to structural  productivity  growth since the onset  of the recession  comes 
from a smalle r contribution  from capital input during  and after the recession.   
The remainder reflects  a lower estimate of  the growth rate of structural  
multifactor  productivity,  the part of productivity  not attributed  to other inputs.

 we anticipate that firms w ill increase their labor input s about in line with output, 
implying a rate of actual productivity growth that is similar to its trend growth rate. 
We expect the pace of private employme nt growth to hold fairly steady, with 
private job gains averaging nearly 200,000 per month through 2013—little changed from 
our March forecast—and continuing at a similar pace throughout 2014.  In the 
government sector, we expect st ate and local employment to change little this year and 
then to rise modestly over the next two years as budget pressures ease somewhat.  All 
told, these employment gains push the unemployment rate down to about 7¾ percent by the end of 2013 and to just below 7½ percent by the end of 2014; throughout the next three years, the projected path of the unemp loyment rate is slightly lower than our 
forecast in the March Tealbook, reflecting its lower starting point.  
Resource Utilization 
Our estimates of economic slack in this projection are a little narrower than those 
in the March Tealbook.  Nevertheless, economic sl ack is expected to remain sizable over 
the medium term, with the unemployment ra te at the end of 2014 projected to be 
1½ percentage points above the NAIRU and the output gap to be 2¾ percent. 
Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly reflects trends in the 
labor force, our concept of capacity for the industrial sector focuses on the capability of 
plants to produce with the equipment that is  in place and ready to operate; it does not take 
account of the potential workforce, either insi de the industrial sector or outside of it.  
Given these differences, we expect  capacity utilization in the industrial sector to continue 
to be taken up more quickly than is reflected in the GDP gap, both because 
manufacturing output growth is anticipated to exceed real GDP growth over the forecast 
period and because manufacturing capacity is pr ojected to rise less ra pidly than potential 
GDP over the next two years.  In 2014, pot ential GDP and manufacturing capacity are 
projected to increase at about  the same rate.  As a result , our projection calls for the 
factory operating rate to rise to its long-run average in the second half of this year and 
then to move above it over the next two years despite a still-sizable GDP gap. 
Prices and Compensation 
We continue to expect that the wide marg in of slack in the labor market and low 
rates of price inflation will restrain the in crease in labor costs over the medium term.

 employment cost index are expected to rise  about 2¾ percent per year, on average, in 
2012 and 2013—a touch more than we projec ted in our March forecast—and around 
3 percent in 2014.  This small upward revision ma inly reflects the sli ghtly lower path of 
the unemployment rate in this projection.  These increases in compensation, combined 
with our projection for mode rate productivity gains over the medium term, imply only a 
modest rate of increase in unit la bor costs over the forecast period. 
Prices of imported core goods were little  changed in the first quarter, held down 
by the lagged effects of the st eep decline in nonfuel commodity prices that occurred late 
last year.  Core import price inflation is e xpected to pick up to about 1½ percent by the 
end of 2012 and then persist at that rate th rough 2014, consistent with the projected pace 
of foreign CPI inflation, m oderate dollar depreciation, and the flattening out of 
commodity prices.  Relative to the March Tealbook, stronge r-than-expected import price 
data for March led us to revise up slightly our forecast for core import price inflation in 
the first half of this year, but our projec tion is essentially unchanged over the medium 
term. 
Measures of longer-term in flation expectations have changed little, on net, since 
the time of the March Tealbook.  Median 5- to-10-year expected inflation from the 
Michigan survey ticked up 0.1 percentage point  to 3 percent in March and remained at 
that rate in the preliminary April release.5  Meanwhile, the TIPS-based measure of the 
five-year forward rate of inflation compensa tion has increased about ¼ percentage point 
since the March Tealbook, but we estimate that  only a relatively small portion of that 
increase reflects higher inflation expectations. 
As in previous Tealbooks, we  anticipate that th e projected low le vel of resource 
utilization will help to hold the average pace of inflation below the Committee’s 
objective.  However, in light of the narrower ma rgin of slack in this forecast and higher 
readings on inflation early th is year (even leaving aside the noisy nonmarket data), we 
have nudged up our forecast for core consumer price inflation over the medium term.  We 
now project that core PCE pri ces will increase 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 
both 2013 and 2014, up 0.1 percentage point in e ach year relative to the March Tealbook.  
Increases in energy prices ar e projected to push total PCE inflation slightly above the 
core rate of inflation this year, but with en ergy prices expected to decline over the next 
                                                 
5 The average differential between longer-term Michigan inflati on expectations and core PCE 
inflation over the past decade is about 1 percentage point.

 two years, headline inflation is  expected to run a little be low core inflation in 2013 and 
2014.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff’s forecast through 2020 using the FRB/US model and 
our assumptions about long-run supply-side co nditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  
The contour of the long-term outlook de pends on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE in flation at 2 percent, consistent with 
the Committee’s statement after the January meeting on its longer-run goals 
and monetary policy strategies.  The fe deral funds rate continues to be set 
according to the estimated outcome-based rule. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rate s over the 2014–17 peri od, but as the 
System’s portfolio holdings normalize,  this downward pressure wanes and 
thereby contributes somewhat to the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield.  
Beyond 2017, the System’s asset holdings are expected to have  little influence 
on the level of term premiums. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds decrease gradually to normal levels, and banks further eas e their lending standards. 
 The federal government budget deficit (m easured on a NIPA basis) narrows 
from around 4 percent of GDP in 2014 to  about 3¼ percent of GDP in 2017, 
primarily reflecting the effects of the recovery on tax receipts and the 
budgetary restraint imposed by the Budget C ontrol Act.  Thereafter, the deficit 
widens because of fast-rising transfer payments, mostly for programs related 
to health care. 
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates 2 percent per year 
from 2014 to 2017.  The pace of dollar depr eciation tapers off thereafter.  The 
price of crude oil edges down about $2 per year from 2014 to 2016 and 
remains flat in real terms thereafter.  Foreign real GDP rises at an average 
annual rate of 3¼ percent in 2015 through 2017 and then gradually edges down to a 3 percent pace by late in the decade.

  The NAIRU declines from 6 percent in  late 2014 to 5¼ percent in late 2017 
as conditions in the labor market c ontinue to improve gradually, and it 
remains at 5¼ percent in the long run.  Potential GDP increases at an average 
annual rate of about 2½ percent from 2015 through the end of the decade.   
The economy is forecast to enter 2015 with output still below its potential level, 
the unemployment rate above the assumed NAI RU, and inflation lowe r than the long-run 
objective of the Committee.  In the staff’s long-term projection, further improvements in 
household and business confidence, dimi nishing uncertainty, and more-supportive 
financial conditions enable real GDP to rise at an average annual ra te of 3½ percent from 
2015 to 2017.  With real GDP expanding at a pace significantly faster than the growth 
rate of potential output, labor market conditi ons improve further; by the end of 2017, the 
unemployment rate is just over 5½ percent.  With the margin of slack in labor and 
product markets diminishing, consumer price inflation edges up gradually and is just 
below 2 percent in 2017.  Late in th e decade, the economy settles down at an 
unemployment rate near 5¼ pe rcent (the assumed long-run NAIRU), with inflation at 
2 percent (the Committee’s objective) and a nom inal funds rate close to 4¼ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign economi c activity  expanded  at an estimated 3¼  percent pace in the first 
quarter, up from the 1¼ percent rate recorded for  the final quarter of 2011.  As expected, 
the factors that suppressed output growth late last year , most notably the supply chain  
disruptions brought on by the floods in Thailand, proved temporary.  In fact , because 
recent indicators, particularly in the e merging market economies, came in a little stronger 
than we had anticipated , our first -quarter estimate of foreign GDP growth  is a touch  
higher than in the March Tealbook. 
In contrast to the s omewhat  improved indicators for global activity , financial 
conditions in Europe have backtracked of late, with markets becoming concerned once 
again about developments in Spain and Italy.  (See the box “ Continuing Vulnerabilities in 
the Euro Area ” for further details.)  So far, t he recent increase in tensions  remains 
broadly consistent with our baseline view that Europe will muddle through its crisis but face period ic setbacks along the way.  Continued financial stress and fiscal austerity 
should keep the euro area in recession throughout 2012 and  hold down growth to  a 
subpar pace into 2014.  The r isk remain s, of course, that financial strains in Europe will 
snowball into a more severe crisis , a scenario that we explore in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section.  
Assuming that this risk does not materialize, we project  that real GDP growth in 
the foreign economies should average about 2¾ percent during the remainder of this year before picking up to 3½ percent by  2014.  Growth strengthens  as monetary policy 
remains generally accommodative, the U.S. recovery solidifies, and conditions in the euro area improve.  Our outlook is little changed from the March Tealbook. 
Readings on foreign inflation came back down in the first quarter, to below 
2½ percent from around 3 percent in the second half of 2011.  With oil and other commodity prices largely quiescent since the March Tealbook and projected to remain so over the forecast period, we expect inflation to stay  near 2½ percent through 2014.  Our 
forecast envisions some further monetary policy easing this year  in Japan and the United 
Kingdom.  However, as growth improves  and output gaps narrow , we expect that central 
banks will begin withdrawing accommodative measures in 2014.

 Continuing  Vulnerabilities  in the Euro Area 
The normalization  of financial conditions in  the euro area appears  to have stalled 
since the time of  the March Tealbook.   Most strikingly,  market concerns  about 
Italy and Spain have  intensified, as  shown by a renewed  rise in their sovereign  
bond spreads (see lower‐ left figure on next page).  Additionally,  euro‐area bank 
stock prices have fallen, and bank CDS spreads have generally  risen, with the 
greatest increase in  Spain.  This turnaround  in financial conditions  partly reflects 
the fact that, despite significant  progress,  financial backstops  for vulnerable  
euro‐area governments  remain inadequate.   With their fundamental  fiscal and 
competitiveness  problems  still unresolved, this  situation leaves euro‐area 
countries—most  notably Italy and Spain—susceptible  to shifts in market 
sentiment.    
 
Italy’s vulnerability  to such changes  in sentiment  stems primarily  from the 
country’s  weak economic  growth prospects  and high debt‐to‐GDP ratio (see 
lower‐ right figure  on next page).  Political challenges  to addressing  these 
problems  are significant,  and further setbacks over  the intermeeting  period in 
the approval  of a major labor market  reform have revived doubts about the 
ability of the technocratic  government  to implement structural  reforms.      
 
For Spain, three factors  appear to be behind the resurgence  of market pressure, 
which has sent Spanish 10‐year bond  yields above Italian yields for the  first time 
since last  summer.  First,  economic  activity has continued  to be very weak, with  
GDP contracting  at an annual  rate of 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter and the 
unemployment  rate soaring  to nearly  24 percent in February,  about three times  
its level  before the global financial crisis.  We expect GDP in Spain to contract 
2¼ percent (from fourth quarter  to fourth  quarter) in 2012 and to stagnate  in 
2013.  In principle,  growth could be revived through  structural  reforms and 
resulting improvements  in competitiveness, but reforms  are progressing  only 
slowly and, in any case, their effect on competitiveness  is not likely to take hold 
quickly.  
 
Second, Spain’s fiscal performance has  been disappointing.   The 2011 budget 
deficit was recently announced  to be 8.5 percent of GDP, significantly  above the 
target of 6 percent.   In addition,  after somewhat  messy renegotiations  with 
European  authorities,  the country’s  deficit target for 2012  was revised up to 
5.3 percent  from 4.4 percent.   The 2013  deficit target remains  unchanged  at 
3 percent  of GDP.  Both of those targets  will prove  challenging  to achieve.    
 Spain’s fiscal difficulties  in 2011 were  due to stagnant  economic  output and tax 
revenues  as well as to poor budget performance among  regional and local 
governments, which have  considerable budget autonomy  in Spain.
1  Further, 
largely due to recognition  of regional and local government  arrears, the Spanish 
government  recently announced  that it expected  public debt to increase to 
                                                 
1 On April 12, parliament  passed the Budget  Stability  Law, intended  to roughly replicate 
the European  Fiscal Compact  at the national level  and thereby gain control of regional 
budgets, but it remains to be seen how  effective the law will be.

 80 percent of GDP in 2012, about 6 percentage  points more than previously  
anticipated.   This revision still leaves  the debt‐to‐GDP ratio of Spain well below  
that of Italy’s but suggests  the potential  for rapid increases  in debt.  
 
Third, markets worry that public debt could be significantly  boosted by further 
bank bailouts,  importantly  related to the on‐going bust in the property  market.    
Housing sales have remained  severely depressed,  and house prices in March 
were down 11.5 percent over the  previous  12 months and almost 30 percent 
below their peak in December  2007.  About 8  percent of loans at Spanish  banks 
are nonperforming, the  majority of which are related to construction  and real 
estate.  In early February, the  Spanish government  gave banks until the end of 
2012 to increase  loan loss provisions  and capital buffers by up to €50 billion.  This 
increase appears  likely to cover embedded losses  in the system, though  a few 
individual  banks, especially  those already  in receivership, might require  more 
public assistance this  year.  Additional  provisioning  will likely  be necessary  in 2013 
and 2014 as real estate  values decline further and unemployment  remains high.  
Although  Spanish authorities  hope banks  will be able to handle such  provisions  
through earnings  retention,  capital raising, and  mergers,  significant  additional  
public capital injections  may be necessary  if the severity of macroeconomic  stress 
worsens.  
 
As indicated  in the lower‐ right figure, even  under the staff’s somewhat  
pessimistic  assumptions  for GDP growth and fiscal performance,  Spain’s debt ‐to‐
GDP path is relatively  favorable.   Even so, a deeper recession and  greater 
deterioration  of banking conditions  than we currently  anticipate  would have the 
potential  to burden  the government’s  balance sheet  with significant  additional  
debt, further  weakening  prospects  for fiscal  stabilization.   Markets  are clearly 
focused on these downside  risks at present.

  ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Our forecast of economic activity in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) is 
broadly unchanged from the March Tealbook .  After stalling in the fourth quarter, AFE 
GDP  is expected to grow at a 1¼ percent pace in 2012.  We continue to project a mild 
contraction of the euro- area economy this year, with a more severe downturn in the 
peripheral European countries , where financial stresses and fiscal consolidation  are very 
pronounced.  Amid an eventual easing of these financial stresses and some strengthening 
of demand from the United States, we projec t that GDP growth in the AFEs will rise to 
1¾ percent in 2013 and 2½ percent in 2014. 
Recent inflation data in the AFEs are also broadly in line with our March 
Tealbook projections .  We estimate that consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 
2 percent in t he first quarter of 2012.  As the effect  of the earlier rise in  oil prices 
dissipates, we project that inflation will moderate to 1 ½ percent in the second quarter  and 
remain at about that pace through 2014.  Contained inflation and persistent economic 
slack  should allow  the major foreign central banks to maintain stimulative monetary 
policy at least until 2014. 
Euro Area 
Recent data are in line with our forecast of a mild contraction of economic 
activity.  T he euro -area composite PMI for the first quarter moved up off its  fourth -
quarter  low but remained under 50.  Industrial production over the first two months of the 
year fell below the fourth- quarter average.  Labor market conditions deteriorated further, 
as the unemployment rate reached 10.8  percent in February, its highest level since 1997.  
Consumption indicators were mixed  through March . 
European policymakers made some progress in surmounting the hurdles 
associated with the debt crisis.  The  Greek government  successfully concluded a debt 
exchange of private ly held  domestic bonds.  And European authorities, in conjunction 
with the IMF, approved a second rescue package for Greece that secures  additional 
financing through the end of 2014.  European policymakers a lso agreed to increase the 
combined lending capacity of their rescue facilities from €500 billion to €700 billion, of 
which €500 billion remain s uncommitted.  However,  this action fell short of calls to raise 
the lending capacity to over €900 billion and  could prove insufficient to backstop 
vulnerable euro -area economies .

  After having improved significantly earlier this year,  financial conditions 
worsened more recently as incoming data continued to point to declining euro-area output 
and as fiscal and political developments in Spain and Italy were disappointing.  Sovereign 
bond spreads are up in many countries in the region, and stock prices are down , 
especially for banks .  (One manifestation of the financial pressures weighing on several 
peripheral economies is discussed in the box “Euro-A rea TARGET2 Balances.”)   In the 
March Tealbook, we had already anticipated that financial stresses would only slowly 
diminish over the forecast period, with occasional bouts of financial turmoil likely .  
Accordingly, in our current projection, we marked down the euro -area forecast only 
¼ percentage point in 2012 and a touch in early 2013.  We still expect GDP to contract 
through the end of this year and to expand a meager 1 percent in 2013 before accelerating  
to a 2  percent pace by the end of 2014.  This  recovery is anticipated to be weak, as tight 
fiscal and financial conditions weigh considerably on economic activity. 
Euro -area inflation stepped  down to a 2.5 percent pace in the first quarter from 
3.8 percen t in the fourth.  With  considerable resource slack and moderating energy prices , 
we expect inflation to fall further to around 1¾ percent in 2012 before settling at  
1½ percent in 2013 and 2014.  T he European Central Bank (ECB) left policy rates 
unchanged  at its past two  meetings .  We expect the ECB to keep its benchmark policy 
rate at 1  percent over the forecast period and to continue to provide significant liquidity 
support to banks.  If pressures in sovereign bond markets become great enough, the ECB may resume purchases of peripheral sovereign bonds under its Securities Market s 
Programme.  
United Kingdom 
Recent data, including strong readings on services and construction PMIs, led us 
to revise up somewhat our estimate for GDP growth in the first half of this year , to 
1¼ percent , following a 1.2 percent contraction in the fourth quarter.  We expect growth 
to stay at that pace  in the second half of this year but to rise to 2¾ percent in 2014.  
However, this growth is insufficient to substantially narrow the output gap.  The  
U.K. government’s deficit reduction plans, which were reaffirmed in the 2012 budget, are 
expected to shave nearly 1  percentage point from  GDP growth over the forecast period. 
We expect i nflation to move down to 2¼ percent in 2012 from a rate of nearly 
5 percent in the previous year.  That said, w e marked up our inflation forecast nearly 
½ percent age point in 2012 because of  surprisingly high March inflation and the

 Euro -Area TARGET2 Balances  
The extent to which the EC B should continue to provide funding to troubled 
euro- area banks —and  at what terms—has become a source of considerable 
debate among the various euro- area n ational c entral banks (NCBs).1  The recent 
sharp rise in TARGET2  balances has provided a focal point for this debate.2
    
The TARGET2 system settles domestic and cross- border interbank payments in 
the euro area by crediting and debiting banks’ reserve accounts at their 
respective NCBs.   For example, if  an Italian resident requests that its bank make a 
payment to a German bank (say to purchase a German product or to open a German bank  account), TARGET2 generates a deposit in the German bank’s 
account at the Bundesbank  and subtracts  a matching amount from  the Italian 
bank’s account at the Bank of Italy.  At the end of each day, if an NCB has 
received more payments than it has made, it acquires a TARGET2 claim against 
the ECB.  If it has made more payments than it has received, it acquires a TARGET2 liability.  These claims and liabilities are the TARGET2 balances in 
question.
3
    
As shown in the figures on the next page, before the global financial crisis and 
subsequent European sovereign debt crisis , TARGET2  claims and liabilities  
(shown in red) were small.  Even though Greece and Spain ran sizable current 
account deficits, and thus made substantial cross-border payments, private 
capital in flows adequately financed these outgoing payments.  In early 2008, 
however, as banks in both Spain and Greece found it more difficult  to obtain 
private market funding, they began to rely increasingly on NCB funding  (shown in 
black).  Later, i n the summer of 2011, as the euro- area sovereign debt crisis 
intensified , lending by the Bank of Italy to Italian banks  began to increase rapidl y 
as well.  The NCB  lending in these countries helped avoid the potential 
disruptions that might have occurred from forced deleveraging by peripheral banks and fire sales of assets.  At the same time, however, the resulting 
injections of liquidity into the peripheral banking systems financed payments 
outflows, leading to increased TARGET2 liabilities for these countries’ NCBs .  As 
recipients of payments flows, banks in Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, and Luxembourg  greatly reduced their reliance on liquidity drawn from their own 
NCBs, and the NCBs in those countries acquired large TARGET2 claims.  The 
Bundesbank  is now the largest creditor, with TARGET2 claims in excess of 
€600 billion, about 25  percent of German GDP, and total TARGET2 liabilities have 
grow n from near zero in 2007 to almost  €1 trillion at present.    
 
                                                 
1 Reflecting such tensions, the Bundesbank and the Austrian National Bank recently 
announced that they would stop accepting as collateral bank debt guaranteed by countries 
with EU support programs.  
2 TARGET2 is an acronym for Trans -European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement 
Express Transfer .  Like the Federal Reserve’s Fedwire, it is a real- time gross settlement system 
settled in central bank money.   
3 Some features of the TARGET2 balances are analogous to those of the Federal Reserve’s 
interdistrict settlement balances.

 Do TARGET2 balances pose risks to the Eurosystem ?  Some observers argue that 
large TARGET2 claims will hinder liquidity provision by the respective NCB s, but 
no such limit on NCB lending exists .  Additionally, some fear  that the risks 
associated with Eurosystem lending may fall disproportionately to those 
countries with large TARGET2 claims.  So long as the Eurosystem remains intact, 
however, these fears are unfounded.  According to Eurosystem rules, capital losses are  allocated according to the respective capital shares of the NCBs in the 
Eurosystem, not according to TARGET2 balances.  Nonetheless, creditor nations 
may worry about the value of their TARGET2 claims in the event of a messy dissolution of the euro area , as there are no agreements among member 
countries on how to share losses if a country were to leave the euro area or the union were to be entirely d issolved.  
 The legitimacy of these worries i s difficult to assess, but concerns about the 
TARGET2 balances have prompted some German politicians  to call  for caps on 
these balances.  Although the Eurosystem is politically insulated by design, political pres sure could lead to implicit constraints on the conduct of monetary 
policy , potentially lessening the ECB’s effectiveness.   Should political pressure 
ultimately  result in explicit controls on cross -border payments, the viability of the 
monetary union itself would be in doubt.  Even though these dire scenarios may 
well be avoided, the recent expansion of TARGET2 balances is an indicator that 
the fundamental causes of the strains in the euro area have yet to be resolved.

  announcement of supplementary tax measures in the recent  budget.  Inflation then 
moderates  further to 1¾ percent in 2013 and 2014.  We continue to project that the Bank 
of England (BO E) will increase  the scale of  its asset purchase program by  £50 billion .  
However, with economic indicators a bit stronger and our outlook for inflation slightly 
higher, we now expect that the BOE will not resume purchases until the second half of this year  when the B OE can be more certain that inflation pressures are subsid ing.  The 
current program is scheduled to be completed this month, br inging the overall size of the 
program to £325 billion (22 percent of GDP). 
Japan 
Following a contraction of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter, we estimate that 
Japanese real GDP rebounded 2¾ percent in the first quarter, f ueled by the recovery of 
key part s suppliers in Thailand, car purchase incentives, and a step -up in post- earthquake 
reconstruction activity.  However, some recent indicators suggest the underlying pace of growth is weaker.  In particular, February exports barely edged up, and the Bank of Japan’s (B OJ) Tankan index—a key indicator of business confidence—failed to improve.  
Accordingly, we project that real GDP growth will slow to 1½ percent by the end of the 
year.  Growth should remain at that pace in 2013 and 2014, as the effects of a pick up in 
global economic output are  roughly offset by  the completion of reconstruction activity . 
Higher -than-expected food and energy prices  pushed consumer prices up at an 
estimated pace of 1 percent in the first quarter, ½ percentage point more than projected in 
the March Tealbook.  After declining for the past three years, consumer prices are 
expected  to remain roughly constant over the forecast period.  Inflation w ill still be well 
below the BO J’s stated medium-term inflation goal of 1 percent.  Accordingly, w e 
anticipate that the B OJ will expand  its asset purchase program  somewhat further. 
Canada 
Recent data have been  slightly more upbeat than we had expected, leading us to 
raise our estimate of first -quarter GDP growth a touch to 2¼ percent.  In March, the 
manufacturing PMI strengthened and  employment  posted a substantial gain.  W e expect 
growth to pick up from 2¼ percent this year and next to 3 percent by the end of 2014, 
supported by accommodative monetary policy and the projected U.S . recovery .  Our 
GDP forecast is largely unchanged from the March Tealbook.  However, one concern is 
that, unlike in most other advanced economies, household debt continues to rise relative to disposable income, posing some risk of a pullback in housing and consumption.

  As the effects of recent increases in the prices of food and energy fade, w e expect 
inflation to move down from 2½ percent in the first quarter to 2 percent over the rest of 
the forecast  period.  With moderate resource slack and diminishing price pressure, we 
continue to assume that the Bank of Canada will keep its target for the overnight rate at 1 percent th rough 2013 and will tighten starting in ear ly 2014.   
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
Recent data from the emerging market economies (EMEs) have been reasonably 
upbeat.  W e now estimate that real GDP growth in these countries rebounded to an 
annual rate of about 5¼ percent in the first quarter from just 2½ percent in the fourth.  The rebound is due importantly to the restoration of supply chains following last year’s  
flooding in Thailand as well as  to some recovery of both external and domestic demand.  
We project th at growth will stabilize at a near -trend rate of about 4¾ percent  during 2012 
and 2013 before rising to 5 percent in 2014.  The projection for the first quarter and the 
next are revised up a touch, relative to the March Tealbook, in light of stronger -than-
expected indicators in much of emerging  Asia.    
Headline inflation in the EMEs moderated  to an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the 
first quarter .  This rate is  about 1 percentage point below our March  projection, reflecting 
the faster -than-expected dissipati on of food price pressures, especially in China and 
Mexico.  We see inflation remaining at 2¾ percent  in the second quarter before rising  to 
3¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast period.   
Most central banks have kept policy rates unchanged since the March Tealbook, 
although central banks in Brazil  and India  eased policy .  Capital flows in to EME-
dedicated funds slowed in March  after an earlier  sharp run -up in  late January and 
February.  In response to the earlier increase in  flows, the Brazil ian go vernment extended 
a 6 percent tax , previously applied to  external loans and bond issuances with duration of 
up to three years, to those of up to five years.  
China  
Chinese real GDP growth edged down to 7½ percent in the first quarter from a 
revised 7¾ percent in the fourth, both figures about ½ percentage point lower than in the 
March Tealbook.  Investment moderated somewhat, in part reflecting weakness in the 
residential property sector.  However, consumer demand remained robust, with retail sales gro wing around their fourth- quarter pace, and industrial production picked up in

  March.   The trade surplus widened  in the first quarter, as exports rose and imports were 
flat.  And credit conditions eased, with bank lending moving significantly higher in 
March.  In view of these supportive indicators, w e project that Chinese real GDP growth 
will r ise to about 8½ percent in the second quarter. 
Over the remainder of the forecast period , we continue to expect GDP to expand 
at about an 8¼ percent pace.   Restrained growth in the advanced economies will keep  
external demand on the soft side, leaving the  path for Chinese growth a little below our 
estimate of potential.  This  outlook is little changed from the March projection.  We still 
believe that Chinese authorities have sufficient scope for policy action to avoid a hard 
landing, but a less benign outcome, possibly owing to difficulties in the property and banking sectors, remains a risk.  
Chinese headline consumer price inflation moved down further in the first quarter, 
to an annual rate of 1½ percent.  The sharp decline in recent quarters —from 6 percent in 
the third quarter of last year —is largely  a result of  food price increases subsiding as 
supply conditions improved.  Assuming food prices flatten out a s projected , inflation is 
expected to  move back up to around 3 percent over the next three years.    
Other Emerging Asia 
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, we estimate that real GDP rebounded at an annual 
pace of 6½ percent in the first quarter after being flat i n the fourth, as supply chains 
disrupted by flooding were largely restored.  This increase is  about ¾ percentage point 
faster than in our March Tealbook forecast.  T he Thai economy is  recover ing 
considerably more quickly than we had expected from last year’s floods.   In addition, 
first-quarter indicators of both external and domestic demand in the rest of the region also 
surprised on the upside.  Industrial production strengthened and exports, especially to the United States, rose substantially in sever al economies.  PMIs increased further into the 
expansion range in March.  As the temporary boost from the restoration of supply chains fades away, we look for growth in the region to step down to around 4½ percent in the second half of this year before edg ing up to 5 percent in 2014.   
We estimate that quarterly inflation in the region subsided to an annual rate of 
about 3 percent in the first quarter, as previous increases in food prices were reversed .  As 
the trajectory of food prices flatten s out, inflation should pick up to about 3¼ percent 
over the remainder of the forecast period.

  Latin America  
We estimate that real GDP growth in Mexico stepped up to 4 percent in the first 
quarter  from a disappointingly weak pace of 1¾ percent in the fourth.  The step -up in 
Mexican activity in the first quarter is in line with the sharp jump in U.S. manufacturing 
output.  Exports improved through February , and the PMI increased in the first quarter .  
Looking forward , we see Mexican growth moderating to 3½ percent for the rest of this 
year and to 3 percent in 2013 before recovering somewhat in 2014, consistent with the 
projected path for the growth of U.S. manufacturing production. 
For South America, we estimate economic growth edged up to an annual rate of 
3¾ percen t in the first quarter and project it to strengthen slightly further over the forecast 
period.  In Brazil, it appears that real GDP accelerated to a 3¼ percent pace in the first 
quarter, as industrial production and retail sales rebounded.  By 2013, Brazil ian growth 
should firm to 4 percent, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies as 
well as solid commodity exports. 
Inflation declined  to a still- elevated annual rate of 4½ percent in the first quarter 
in Mexico, in part as food prices fell ba ck after spiking earlier this year.   We see inflation 
dipping down further in the current quarter before  settling at about 3½ percent over the 
remainder of the forecast period, a bit below the upper bound of the central bank’s target range.   
In Brazil, inflation slowed to an annual rate of 4¼ percent in the first quarter, and 
we expect it to ease further to about 4 percent in the current quarter.  With economic growth having stalled in the second half of last year, the central bank has been loosening policy since August.  Most recently, in March, the central bank reduced its  policy rate  by 
75 basis points to 9.75 percent and alluded to the possibility of further cuts.  However, w e 
project that Brazilian inflation will move back up as accommodative monetary  policy 
supports an improvement in economic growth.

Financial Developments  
Broad financial market conditions were little changed , on balance, over the 
intermeeting period.  Nonetheless, i nvestors’ economic and policy outlooks swung 
significantly during the period in response to official statements and incoming economic 
data.  Early in the period, r isk appetite  seemed to improve following the March FOMC 
statement , the release of the results  from the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 
Review  (CCAR) , and other incoming information pointing to an improved econom ic 
outlook.  Later in the period, however, market participants  appeared to pull back from 
risk amid signs of increasing financial strains in Europe and as some foreign and U.S. 
economic data releases came in weaker  than  expected .   
On balance, domestic asset prices were little changed.  P olicy expectations  edged 
down, while  Treasury yields were about flat .  Broad indexes of U.S. eq uity prices ended 
the period at about the same levels as the day before the March FOMC meeting , and  
option- implied volatility on  the S&P 500 index rose a little , although it remained  near the 
low end of its recent range.  Risk spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were little 
changed , on net, while  spreads  on sp eculative -grade corporate bonds ended the period a 
bit higher.  I n contrast, broad indexes of foreign equity prices  generally  declined and 
yield spreads on Italian and Spanish sovereign debt to German bunds rose considerably.  
The broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar was about 
unchanged  on net.  Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets were generally stable  
but showed some signs of deterioration later in the period .   
Financing flows for financial and nonfinancial corporations remained solid , 
supported by continued strong corporate bond issuance and further gains  in commercial 
and industrial (C &I) loan s.  In the household sector, nonrevolving consumer credit 
expanded briskly, while revolving credit contracted somewhat after posting a robust fourth -quarter increase.   Mortgage refinancing activity remained subdued despite low 
mortgage rates.  Nonetheless, responses to the April SLOOS indicated that, in the aggregate, modest net fraction s of domestic banks eased their lending standards on core 
loans and experienced somewhat stronger demand fo r such loans in the first quarter of 
2012, and moderate to large net fractions of institutions had eased many terms on  C&I loans to firms of all sizes  (see appendix) .

  POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Policy expectations edged down, while nominal T reasury yields ended the 
intermeeting period about unchanged, on net, despite some notable fluctuations within 
the period.  T he March FOMC statement  prompted a modest rise in yields, reportedly as 
market participants perceived a more optimistic tone in the economic assessment than they had been expect ing.  Yields rose a bit further following the release of the CCAR 
results later that afternoon  and continued to move higher overnight as investors digested 
the day’s news.  Investors seemed to read the FOMC minutes as suggesting a higher bar for additional balance sheet expansion than previously thought, prompting a notable 
increase in policy expectations and longer- term Treasury yields.  However, interest rates 
dropped later in the period, as concerns about the European sovereign debt crisis and the 
outlook for global growth resurfaced following downbeat news about the Spanish fiscal situation  and some soft economic data releases in the United States  and abroad.  In 
particular, the March employment report came in weaker  than investors had expected, 
prompting a substantial decline in  policy expectations and Treasury yields .  Speeches by 
FOMC participants over the period were interpreted as displaying  a wide range of views 
among C ommittee members regarding the outlook for monetary policy but appeared to 
have only a modest effect on market measures of policy expectations and Treasury  yields  
on net.   
On balance, m arket -based readings on the expected policy path derived from  
OIS rates  edged lower  over the period and now suggest ed that the target federal funds 
rate will first rise above its  current range in the fourth quarter of 2013, a quarter later than 
at the time of the March meeting .  In contrast, the modal policy path—the most likely  
values for future federal funds rates based on risk-neutral distribution s—derived from 
quotes on interest rate caps indicates that the current target range will prevail through mid-2015.
1
Results from the Open Market Desk’s primary d ealer survey also showed little 
change in investors’ policy expectations.  Relative to the March survey, dealers left unchanged the ir median forecast for the target federal funds rate through the first half of 
2016 and continued to view the third quarter of 2014 as the most likely time of the first 
increase in the federal funds rate.  Dealers expected no major change in the language of    
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 14 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.

  the FOMC statement at the April meeting except possibly an acknowledgment that the 
pace of labor market improvement has slowed and tensions in European markets picked 
up a bit.  In response to questions about possible future options for easing, participants 
assigned a slightly lower probability to additional securities  purchases or changes in 
balance sheet guidance and a slightly higher probability to a lengthening of the duration 
of the SOMA portfolio within the next two years.  Dealers largely maintained  their 
forecasts for real GDP growth and core and headline PCE inflation in the next  
three years.   
Treasury yields also edged down, remain ing near the bottom end of their 
historical range.  (See the box “What Explains the Current Low Level of the  
10-Year Treasury Term Premium?” )  The Desk’s outright purchases and sales of 
Treasury securities under the m aturity extension program  proceeded  as planned and did 
not appear to have any material adverse effect on Treasury market functioning.2
TIPS -based  inflation compensation over the next five years declined 13 basis 
points, likely reflecting in part some recent stabilization in commodity prices.   The   
TIPS -based  five-year forward measure increased 20 basis points on net; however,  
swaps -based forward measures of inflation compensation indicate  a much smaller 
increase.   Inflation uncertainty as measured by caps -implied volatility was about 
unchanged and remained near the middle of its ran ge over the past three years .  (See the 
box “Inflation Probability Distributions Implied by Inflation Caps .”)  
SHORT -TERM DOLLAR FUNDING MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  
Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets were stable over most of the 
intermee ting period despite some recent concerns about Europe.  The spread between  the 
rates implied by  the three -month forward rate agreement and the OIS rate three to six 
months ahead ticked up late in the period but remained  well below levels seen in late 
2011.  Spreads of one-month and three-month dollar LIBOR over OIS rates ended the 
period about flat on balance.  The total outstanding amount on the Federal Reserve’ s 
dollar liquidity swap lines declined to $32 billion in mid -April, down from $65 billion at 
                                                 
2 The Federal Reserve purchased $ 56 billion and sold $ 44 billion of Treasury securities over the 
intermeeting period under the maturity extension program; the average maturity of SOMA Treasury 
holdings has lengthened by about 1¼ years since the beginning of the program.  In addition, the Federal 
Reserve reinvest ed $35 billion in  agency MBS from principal payments from its holdings of agency 
securities .

What Explains the Current Low Level  
of the 10‐Year Treasury  Term  Premium?  
Estimates  of the 10‐year Treasury  term premium  from the staff’s standard  term 
structure model  declined  substantially  from June 2011  through December  2011 
and then increased  modestly  and are currently  at a historically  low level.1  These 
changes in the estimates  can be attributed  to various  factors, including  safe‐
haven demand  resulting  from the European crisis,  the maturity  extension  
program,  and other economic variables.   To examine  the importance of  these 
factors, the estimated  10‐year term  premium  is regressed on a set  of macro and  
financial variables.   On bala nce, this analysis attributes  most of the decline in the 
term premium  from June 2011 to March 2012  to a reduction in  uncertainty about 
future interest rates,  the Federal Reserve’s nonconventional  monetary  policy, 
and investor concerns  about the European  debt situation.    
The list of independent variables  in the regression  analysis includes interest rate 
uncertainty  (as measured  by implied volatilities  from near‐term options on 10‐
year Treasury  note futures), capacity  utilization  (to capture the  cyclicality  of the 
term premium),  and foreign custody holdings  of Treasury  securities  at the FRBNY  
as a percentage  of nominal GDP (to capture  the relatively  inelastic demand for 
Treasury securities  from foreign official institutions).2  In addition,  the list 
includes both the S&P 500 implied  volatility  and the 30‐day rolling correlation  
between S&P  500 returns  and changes in the 10‐year Treasury  rate to capture the  
safe‐haven demand  for Treasury securities  resulting  from domestic equity  market 
volatility.   To capture the  effects of total Treasury supply and SOMA holdings  on 
term premiums,  we include the  amounts  of Treasury  securities  outstanding  and 
SOMA‐held Treasury securities,  both measured  in 10‐year equivalents, as  a 
percentage of  nominal GDP.3  Finally, the average spread of Spanish and Italian 
10‐year sovereign yields over German 10‐ year sovereign yields is  included  as a 
proxy for euro‐zone worries.4

Structure  Model and the Recent  Behavior of Long‐ Term Yields and Distant‐ Horizon Forward 
Rates,” Finance and Economics  Discussion  Series  2005‐33 (Washington:   Board of Governors  of 
the Federal  Reserve System,  August).

Implications  of Changes in the Term Premium,”  Federal  Reserve Bank  of St. Louis Review , 
vol. 89, July/August,  pp. 241–70.  
3 We did not include SOMA‐held agency MBS securities  as an additional  independent  
variable because  its sample is too short as SOMA held no agency MBS securities  before 
December  2008.    
4 To isolate the effect of euro zone  worries, the model uses  the residuals  from an auxiliary 
regression  of the proxy  variable on foreign custody  holdings,  SOMA Treasury holdings,  and 
total Treasury securities  outstanding  as the orthogonalized  euro zone worries variable.

The results  of this regression  are reported  in the second column of the table 
below.  All parameter  estimates  are statistically  significant  and have the expected  
signs.  The  third column in the table uses the model estimates  to decompose the  
change in the term premium  over the  period from June 2011 to March 2012.   Out 
of a total decrease  of about 75  basis points in the estimated term premium  over 
this period, about 20 basis points can be attributed  to lower interest rate 
uncertainty,  about 20 basis points to the change in SOMA Treasury  holdings,  and 
about 20 basis points to concerns  about the European  crisis.  The fit of the model 
is better for the period  from June 2011 th rough December  2011, and  it attributes  a 
larger portion of  the decline in the term premium  over this  period to rising 
worries about the European  situation.   However,  the regression predicts  a 
sharper rise  in the term premium  as those worries  eased this year than  is 
estimated  to have occurred.

 Inflation  Probability  Distributions  Implied by Inflation  Caps 
Inflation caps and floors are option‐like securities  with payoffs  tied to the rate of realized 
headline CPI inflation measured  at various  horizons.   A zero‐coupon inflation cap (floor) 
delivers a nonzero  payoff if the rate of cumulative  inflation at the time  of maturity  is 
above (below) the  strike rate.  The  market for inflation caps  started around 2007; it 
remains small compared  with the TIPS market, but market participants  indicate that the 
inflation caps market has been growing  rapidly in recent years.1 
The staff uses a nonparametric  methodology  to derive  a risk‐ neutral distribution  of future 
inflation based on caps with a range of  strikes.2  The two  panels in the figure below show 
the estimated  risk‐ neutral probability  distributions  of annualized  cumulative  inflation 
over the next 5 and 10 years,  respectively, for the  most recent date  (solid bars) and the 
day before the March FOMC  meeting (dashed lines). 3  Some of the probability  mass in 
the right tail of the distribution  for inflation over the  next 5 years shifted notably to the 
left over the  intermeeting  period, consistent  with lower readings of  inflation 
compensation  from TIPS and inflation swaps.  In comparison,  the risk‐ neutral distribution  
over the next 10 years remains largely unchanged.

The two panels  in the figure below show changes in the same risk‐ neutral probability  
distributions  over a six‐month  period from October 18,  2011 (dashed  lines), to April 17,  
2012 (solid bars).  Over the  next 5 years, the implied distributions  suggest a shift in the 
probability  mass away from low inflation outcomes  toward inflation outcomes  between 
2 and 4 percent.   Presumably,  this shift reflects  the gradual improvement in  the U.S. 
economic  outlook and the recent run‐ up in energy prices.  Over the  next 10 years,  the 
probability  mass from the left tail of the distribution  has shifted  toward the center of the 
distribution.   
In summary,  quotes on inflation caps  and floors provide useful information  about 
changes in the perceived  distributon of  future inflation.   The staff  will continue  to 
monitor those instruments  in addition to TIPS and inflation swaps in gauging inflation 
expectations  and market assessments  of inflation risks.

  the time of the March  FOMC m eeting ; demand for dollars fell at the lending operations 
of both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.  In addition, t he average 
maturity of unsecured financial commercial paper outstanding was about unchanged for 
institutions with European parents and slightly higher for institutions with U.S. parents.  
For both types of institutions, average maturities remained  above recent historical 
averages.  
In secured funding markets, general collateral repo rates generally remain ed 
slightly elevated, reportedly reflecting increased funding demand from dealers in the face of heavy seasonal issuance of Treasury bills  and continued sales of short- term securities 
by the Federal Reserve.  Spreads on overnight asset -backed commercial paper over rates 
on AA-rated nonfinancial paper were unchanged to slightly lower, and the level of those spreads remained similar for U .S. and European institutions. 
Over the intermeeting period, equity prices of U.S.  financial institutions  
outperformed broader  stock market indexes, boosted in part by the CCAR results , as 
investors reportedly viewed the stressed capital ratios of some institutions as being higher than expected and in some cases found the payouts to shareholders to be greater than expected .  First-quarter earnings at several large banking organizations also appeared to 
come in somewhat above expectations, on balance, partly reflecting improvements in mortgage banking revenue.  CDS spreads for the largest domestic bank holding 
companies narrowed  following the CCAR announcement.  However, the se spreads  
subsequently retraced when  broader market sentiment appeared to turn more negative, 
and ended the period slightly wider on net.  Bond issuance by financial firms picked up 
further in March from its strong pace in the previous two months, as issuers took 
advantage of the improved market sentiment following the CCAR .   
On April 3, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the credit rating of GE 
Capital ’s senior unsecured debt to A1.  The downgrade resulted  from the implementation 
of a revised global rating methodology for financial institutions that  attributes a higher 
risk profile to market-funded financial institutions.
  The firm ’s CDS spreads have 
widened moderately since the downgrade, in line with thos e of other large financial 
institutions.  While the possibility of additional ratings downgrades for financial 
institutions remains in the near  term, the effect on market sentiment appeared  to be 
limited.

  FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Financial strains within the e uro area increased over the period.  Sovereign 
spreads in Spain and Italy moved notably higher, European bank equity indexes dropped 
sharply, and CDS premiums on Spanish banks surged .  Partly as a result , headline foreign 
equity indexes declined  and corpor ate credit spreads widened .   
Amid some volatility, yields on benchmark sovereign bonds for Germany, Japan, 
and the United Kingdom ended the period roughly unchanged, and foreign headline 
equity indexes declined 2 to 6 percent.  Both benchmark yields and e quities decreased 
late in the period in reaction to weaker -than-expected euro -area macroeconomic data and 
the U.S. employment report as well as to signs that financial pressures in the euro area 
were increasing.   
After falling steadily since late last yea r, sovereign spreads of Italian and Spanish 
debt over comparable- maturity German bunds have risen  sharply since the March FOMC 
meeting.  These spreads rose partly in re sponse to news that Spain would miss its fiscal 
target for this year and would need to make further budget cuts, as well as to renewed concerns about the prospects for Spanish banks.  Although funding pressures in the euro interbank market continued to abate over the period, with the three-month euro  
LIBOR –OIS spread narrowing to about 30 basis points, euro-area bank stocks plummeted 
by over 14 percent, driven by sharp declines in the share prices of Spanish and Italian 
banks.  In addition, five -year bank CDS premiums rose across the euro area ; CDS 
premiums  for Spanish banks increased sharply and reached levels close to the peaks  seen  
last year.  Despite a successful debt restructuring and  a new aid package for Greece, t he 
yield on Greece’s new post -restructuring, 10-year bond is above 21 percent, close to 
levels seen  last September .    
The sta ff’s broad nominal dollar index is about unchanged over the intermeeting 
period, as the dollar appreciated a gainst  most emerging market currencies  but depreciated 
moderately against the yen and sterling .  Although the dollar was little changed against 
the euro, the Swiss franc strengthened against the euro in response to the heightening of 
concerns regarding the euro area and very briefly breached the Swiss National Bank’s 
stated ceiling for the franc against the euro, prompting the central bank to reiterate that it was prepared to prevent the franc from trading beyond th at level.

  The People’ s Bank of China increased the width of its daily trading band of the 
renminbi to plus or minus 1 percent from ½ percent.  However, because the Chinese 
authorities rout inely intervene in the foreign exchange market and also reset the central 
parity for the renminbi every day, this move does not necessarily imply a change in the pace of appreciation.  As part of its  gradual efforts to internationalize its currency and 
liberalize its markets , China allowed the government of Japan to buy Chinese 
government debt, signed a currency swap agreement with the Reserve Bank of Australia, permitted greater foreign purchases of Chinese securities , and relaxed restrictions on 
short sales of foreign currency. 
Foreign official investors purchased a sizable amount of U.S. Treasury securities 
in January and made additional purchases in February.  Acquisitions were widespread across countries and reflected  in part a return to reserve accumulation by e merging 
market economies in the first quarter.  FRBNY custody data for March show further 
moderate increases in official holdings of Treasur y securities .  TIC  data for January and 
February are consistent with some improvement in risk appetite amo ng private investors 
during those two months.  Foreign private investors, on net, bought Treasury securities 
over this period, although these purchases were well below the level of “flight to safety” purchases in the fourth quarter.  They returned to purchasing U.S. equities, although the purchases were small.  U.S. private investors purchased foreign equities in both January 
and February.   
OTHER  DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad equity  price indexes  fluctuated with  investors’ risk sentiment but ended the 
intermeeting period little changed .  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index rose a 
bit, on net, but stayed  near the lower end of its range over the past five years.  The staff’s 
estimate of the spread between the expected real equity return for the S&P 500 index and 
the real 10 -year Treasury yield —a gauge of the equity premium —remained  very wide by 
historical standards. 
Aggregate operating earnings per share for firms i n the S&P 500 index declined 
4 percent in the fourth quarter on a quarterly basis, with both the financial and 
nonfinancial sectors moving down.  However, results from the few firms that have posted earnings reports for the first quarter, together with Wall Street a nalysts’ forecasts for the 
remaining firms, suggest a resumption of moderately positive quarterly growth for EPS in

  the first quarter.  Looking forward, an index of revisions to analysts’ forecasts of  
year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms is estimated to have registered roughly zero  in 
March and April, suggesting that the spate of negative revisions that occurred last f all and 
winter has eased . 
Yields and spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds changed little  over the 
intermeeting period , while yields and spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds 
increased  some on balance.  Although yields on corporate bonds are low by historical 
standards, staff models indicate that the risk premium component remains relatively  
wide, suggesting that investors continued to be somewhat wary of corporate credit risk.   
The spreads of  yields on A2/P2 unsecured CP issued by nonfinancial firms over yields on 
highly rated nonfinancial issues were about flat, on net, over the intermeeting period. 
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Nonfinancial firms continued to raise funds at a strong pace over the intermeeting 
period.  Bond issuance by both investment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial firms was 
robust in the first quarter , as was the growth in C&I loans at commercial banks.  By 
contrast, the volume of nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding was little changed  on 
net.  L everaged loan issuance was strong in the first quarter, reportedly supported by 
demand for assets from newly issued collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs ) as well as 
pension funds and other institutional investors.  Indeed, f irst-quarter CLO issuance, 
estimated at about $6 billion, was large by recent standards ( a total of only $13 billion in 
CLOs w as issued in all of 2011).  Secondary- market  syndicated  loan prices were about 
unchanged over the intermeeting period.  
Gross public equity iss uance by nonfinancial firms in March  also stayed strong.  
Lagging data indicate that share repurchases and cash -financed mergers by nonfinancial 
firms remained robust in the fourth quarter, leaving net equity issuance deeply negative.  Announcements of mer gers and of new share repurchase programs suggest that equity 
retirement s were strong again  in the first quarter. 
Available indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to 
be quite solid.  The aggregate ratio of debt to  assets is estimated to have be en stable  at a 
relatively low level  in the fourth quarter, as proceeds from firms ’ heavy bond issuance 
have been used, in large part, to refinance other debt, and the liquid asset ratio remained

  near its highest level in more than 20 y ears.  Over the first quarter, the pace at which 
Moody’s upgraded nonfinancial corporate bonds exceeded that  of downgrades.  The  
six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial firms remained low in February and 
March, and the C&I loan delinquency rate fell again in the fourth quarter.  The expected 
year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms from the Moody’s KMV model was 
unchanged in March. 
In contrast, f inancial conditions in the commercial real estate  (CRE)  sector 
remained  strained  amid weak fu ndamentals and tight underwriting conditions.  Prices for 
CRE  properties continued to fluctuate at low levels, while vacancy rates and delinquency 
rates remained elevated.   CMBS issuance in the first quarter of 2012 is below that of the 
first quarter of la st year.  CMBS delinquency rates ticked up again in March, as 
borrowers struggled to refinance much of the approximately $33 billion  in maturing  
five-year loans that were originated at the peak of CRE prices in 2007.  The 
announcement of possible sales of Maiden Lane III assets on April 3 may also have 
weighed on CMBS markets, as spreads on AAA tranches , which had narrowed since the 
start of the year,  widened notably following the announcement.  That said, according to 
the April S LOOS, a modest net fraction  of domestic banks reported having eased 
standards on CRE loans, and a significant net fraction experienced increased demand in such loans.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Although mortgage rates remained near their historic al lows, conditions in 
residential mortgage m arkets continue to be weak .  Mortgage delinquencies stayed 
elevated despite some reduction in the rate at which mortgages are entering delinquency for the first time .  House prices ticked up again in February but remained 2 percent lower 
than their year- earlier level.  Tight lending standards and low levels of home equity 
continued to hold back refinancing activity.  
By contrast, consumer credit has grown at a solid pace, on balance,  in recent 
months.  Nonrevolving credit has  expanded briskly of late, in la rge part because of  
strength in student loans, which are now almost entirely originated by the federal 
government.  R evolving credit contracted somewhat of late after posting robust gains in 
the fourth quarter, in part because nonprime borrowers have continued to face tight underwriting standards for credit cards.  Delinquency rates for consumer credit remained

  low, especially for revolving credit , likely reflecting a  compositional shift toward  
higher-quality borrowers due to still- tight credit conditions .  Issuance of consumer ABS 
ticked up in recent months, with auto loan ABS issuance particularly strong.  
A set of special questions was included in the April SLOOS  regarding banks’ 
residential real estate  (RRE) lending policies .  Almost uniformly and on a l oan-weighted 
basis , banks indicated that periods of high volumes of loan applications exceeding their  
application  processing capacity were a factor  currently impeding their ability to originate 
or purchase additional residential mortgage  loans.  In addition, banks primarily  cited the 
greater risk of putbacks of delinquent mortgages by the GSEs and borrower s’ higher 
costs or increased difficulty in obtaining mortgage insurance as reasons why banks are 
less likely to originate some GSE -eligible residential mo rtgage loans than they were in 
2006.  Looking ahead , portfolio -weighted survey responses indicated that a moderate net 
fraction of banks anticipate reducing their exposure to RRE  assets —such as residential  
mortgage loans or government-backed or other mortg age-backed securities —over the 
next year.   
Another set of special questions in the April SLOOS asked about banks’ 
participation in HARP 2.0.  On a portfolio- weighted basis, nearly three- fourths of the 
respondents to the April SLOOS reported that they were “ actively soliciting such  
applications and satisfying most demand as it comes in.” 3
                                                 
3 To date, HARP 2.0 does not appear to have had a material effect on aggregate mortgage 
refinancing volume.  The staff will have a better measure of this effect when the April Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac prepayment data are released in early May.    A similar fraction  of banks 
stated that, based on their experiences to date,  they anticipated that 60 percent or more of 
applications under HARP 2.0 would be approved and successfully completed.  
Respondents reported that difficulties  in securing transfers of existing private mortgage 
insurance coverage, identifying junior-lien holders, and obtaining resubordination of a 
known second lien were important factors  reducing t heir willingness or ability to offer 
additional refinance loans through HARP 2.0.  Only about one-fourth of respondents reported that they were actively soliciting applications to  refinance underwater loans 
outside of HARP 2.0.

  GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Since the March FOMC  meeting , the Treasury  Department  has auctioned 
$199 billio n in nominal securities and $13 billio n in 10- year TIPS.  The auctions were 
generally well received, with bid -to-cover ratios and indirect bidding ratios close to their 
recent averages .  Market participants reportedly continued to  expect  that the Treasury 
will announce its  intention to introduce a floating- rate notes program in the May  
quarterly  refunding statement.   
Gross long-term issuance of municipal bonds was subdued in the first quarter, and 
net issuance of long-term bonds was slightly negative, as municipalities appeared  
reluctant to increase their debt levels  despite generally accommodative market 
conditions.  Ratings downgrades of municipal bonds by Moody’s continued to 
substantially outpace upgrades in the fourth quarter, and higher- frequency data on ratings 
changes suggest that this trend likely continued in the first quarter of 2012.  Nevertheless, 
average CDS spreads for states declined , on net, over  the intermeeting period, and yields 
on long-term general obligation municipal bonds moved up only modestly. 
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit slowed in March but expanded  at a solid 4½ percent pace in the first 
quarter as a whole.  The recent deceleration was mainly attribu table to a few banks 
reducing their holdings of securities rather than to a renewed slowdown in loan growth.  
Indeed, core loans continued to show modest gains in March and have now increased for 10 consecutive months.  The expansion of C&I loans at domestic banks remained robust in March, with growth concentrated at large domestic banks.  In contrast, C&I loans at 
branches and agencies of foreign banks declined, continuing a general pattern of relative 
weakness since late last year.  Growth in real estate loans remained mixed  in March .  
While CRE loans and home equity loans continued to run off, banks’ holdings of  
closed -end residential mortgage loans expanded moderately.  Consumer loans on banks’ 
books rose modestly, partially reversing their recent declin es.  Reportedly, growth has 
been fueled by originations of new auto loans, and banks are actively pursuing new 
personal loans.  Noncore loans, which had been quite strong during much of 2011, have 
been slowing over the past four months.  Banks’ holdings of securities increased during 
March  at a slower pace than in previous months.

  The April SLOOS indicated that, in the aggregate, domestic banks eased their 
lending standards on core loans modestly and experienced somewhat stronger demand for 
such loans in the first quarter of 2012.  Regarding C&I loans, very  large net fraction s of 
domestic banks indicated that they reduced spreads o f C&I loan rates over their cost of 
funds to firms of all sizes ; the net fractions of banks that reported such decreases were 
near the highest on record.  In addition, modest net fractions reported easing standards on C&I loans to large and middle- market firms; standards on loans to small firms were little 
changed.  Domestic banks also reported an increase in demand for C&I loans, on balance,  
from firms of all sizes .  Only a modest net fraction of domestic banks reported having 
eased standards on CRE loans, though a significant net fraction reported having seen increased demand for such loans.  In contrast to their domestic counterparts, branches and agencies of foreign banks reported that spreads on C&I loans were about unchanged, standards on such loans were tightened, and loan demand had weakened.  Concerning lending conditions for households, when responses are weighted by banks’ holdings of RRE loans, the survey showed that standards on such loans were little changed on net .  In 
addition, small net fractions of banks reported having eased standards and seen increased demand on most types of consumer loans, especially auto loans, in the first quarter . 
The M2 aggregate expanded moderately again in March, reflecting growth in 
liquid deposits and currency that was partially offset by further declines in small time 
deposits and balances in retail money market funds.  However, t he levels of M2 and its 
largest component, liquid deposits, remain elevated relative to what would be expected 
based on historical relationships with nominal income and opportunity costs, suggesting investors’ continued strong desire to hold safe and liquid assets.  Currency advanced at a 10¾ percent annual rate in March , as both domestic and foreign demand for U.S. bank 
notes appeared to increase solidly.  In spite of the solid growth in currency, the monetary base contracted at an 18½ percent annual rate in March, reflecting a sharp decline in 
reserve balances that month that was driven mainly by a decrease in foreign central 
banks’ draws on the dollar liquidity swap  lines.  (See the box “Balance Sheet 
Developments over the Intermeeting Period” for a discussion of changes in reserve balances and other balance sheet items since mid -March.)

 Balance Sheet Developments  over the Intermeeting  Period 
Over the intermeeting  period, total assets of the Federal Reserve decreased  
$12 billion  to $2,881 billion  (see the table on the next page).  
Since the March FOMC  meeting,  the Open Market Desk  conducted  25 operations  
as part of the maturity extension  program:   The Desk  purchased  $56 billion in 
Treasury securities  with remaining  maturities  of 6 to 30 years and sold $44 billion 
in Treasury  securities  with maturities  of 3 months  to 3 years.1  In addition,  the 
Desk purchased  $35 billion in agency MBS securities  as part of the policy of 
reinvesting  principal  payments  from agency debt and agency MBS.2   
Foreign central  bank liquidity swaps decreased $33  billion to $32 billion, reflecting  
a decline in draws by the European  Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.  The net 
portfolio holdings  of Maiden Lane LLC and Maiden Lane  II LLC declined  $2 billion 
and $4 billion, respectively, primarily  because of  asset sales.  Procee ds from asset 
sales from the Maiden Lane  II portfolio enabled  the repayment  of the remaining  
outstanding  balances  of the loans from the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York 
(FRBNY) and AIG to Maiden Lane  II on March 1, 2012, and  March 15, 2012,  
respectively.3  After review with the  Board, the investment  objective  of Maiden 
Lane III was revised on April 3, 2012,  and now is consistent  with asset  sales; no 
sales have taken place yet,  although  a competitive bidding  process for the largest  
position in the portfolio has  been initiated.4  The net portfolio  holdings  of Maiden 
Lane III LLC were about unchanged over  the intermeeting  period.  Loans 
outstanding  under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities  Loan Facility  (TALF) were 
slightly lower, reflecting,  in part, the first maturity  of a TALF loan with a three‐
year initial  term.   
On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet,  other deposits   
decreased  $35 billion, reflecting  a decline  of relatively  high GSE balances  that had 
been accumulated  prior to  the payment  of principal  and interest on agency MBS 
last month.  The U.S. Treasury’s  General Account increased  $15 billion.  Reverse  
repurchase agreements  with foreign  official and international  accounts  increased   
                                                 
1 A purchase  of $2 billion conducted  on April 17, 2012, and a sale of $9 billion conducted  on 
April 16, 2012, are reflected  in the text but not in the table, as settlement  occurred  after April 
16, 2012.  A purchase  of $2 billion conducted  before the March FOMC meeting settled on March 
13, 2012, and is reflected  in the table but not in the text. 
2 Because of agency MBS market conventions,  settlements  of these transactions  can 
occur well  after the trade is executed.  
3 A small cash balance  will remain in Maiden Lane II LLC for at least one year in order to 
accommodate  any possible claims on the LLC and to meet trailing expenses  and other 
obligations.  
4 The current investment  objective  is first to repay the Federal  Reserve’s  senior loan, 
followed by AIG’s equity  interest  (for as long as the Treasury maintains  a stake in AIG).  In 
pursuing the objective,  the investment  manager is directed to maximize  sales proceeds  while 
refraining  from disturbing  general financial market conditions.

$5 billion, but  reverse repurchase agreements  with others declined  $2 billion, as 
the FRBNY’s  small‐ scale reverse repurchase  agreement  transactions  conducted  in 
March matured.   Reserve  balances  of depository  institutions  decreased  $1 billion

Appendix  
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
Overall, i n the April  Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, 
modest net fractions of domestic banks reported having eased their lending standards and having 
experienced stronger demand over the past three months.1
The survey results for C&I loans are consistent with continued strong growth in such 
loans held on banks’ books in recent months.  A modest net fraction of domestic banks reportedly  
eased  standards on C&I loans to large and middle- market firms.  Econometric analysis shows that the 
amount of easing reported in the April  survey was  somewhat more than might have been 
expected after accounting for a number of bank- specific factors and the evolution of several key 
macroeconomic variables over the survey period .  Meanwhile, modest net fractions of foreign 
respondents, which mainly lend to businesses, reported having tighten ed lending standards and 
having experienced decreased demand for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans.  The April 
survey contained a number of special questions regarding  banks’ residential real estate lending  
policies ; it also repeated  a set of special questions on lending to firms with exposures to European 
economies.   
2
A mode st net fraction of domestic banks report ed having eased  standards for  commercial 
real estate ( CRE ) loans.  In the January survey, banks had indicated little change in standards for 
such loans.   As has been the case recently, significant  net fractions of domestic banks reported 
that demand for CRE loans had str engthened .  On net, f oreign branches and agencies reported 
that standards and demand for CRE loans were little changed.   Standards to small firms for 
such loans were reportedly about unchanged.  No domestic bank indicated having tightened 
standards on C&I loans.  Moderate to large net fraction s of domestic banks eased many terms on 
C&I loans to firms of all sizes.  Domestic banks also reported an increase in demand from firms 
of all sizes .  A considerable fraction of domestic banks noted an increase in business as a result of 
a decrease in competition from European banks and thei r affiliates  or subsidiaries.   Indeed, a 
small net fraction of f oreign respondents again reported a tightening o f their lending standards on 
C&I loans and a decrease in demand for such loans.   
                                                 
1 The April 2012 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses 
and households over the past three months.  This appendix is based on responses from 57 domestic banks 
and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Respondent banks received the survey on or after 
March 27, 2012, and responses were due by April 10, 2012.  
For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction of 
banks that reported having tightened standards minus  the fraction of banks that reported having eased

reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand.

  In response to a set of special questions, most of which were also asked in the previous 
two surveys, both domestic and foreign banks again reported tightening standards on loans to 
European banks and their affiliates  or subsidiaries as well as on loans to nonfinancial firms with 
substantial business in Europe .  However, the net fractions reporting such tightening were much  
smaller than in the January  survey.  
Regarding loans to households, on a loan-weighted basis, standards on prime residential 
mortgage loans were about unchanged. 3
In response to a set of special questions on banks’ residential real estate lending policies,  
banks cited a variety of factors that were limiting their current ability to originate or purchase 
additional residential real estate (RRE) loans .  In particular, respondents almost uniformly 
indicated that there have been periods in which the volume of loan applications exceeded their 
capacity to process such loans.  In addition, survey respondents generally indicated that , relative 
to 2006, they were less willing to originate GSE -eligible residential mortgage loans for home 
purchase s by borrowers with low FICO scores.  One of the most important factors for this 
decrease in willingness was a h igher r isk of putback s by the GSEs of mortgages that could 
become delinquent .  Another was the higher cost of, and greater difficulty that  borrowers had in 
obtaining, mortgage insurance.     Standards for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) 
were little changed on net.  However, the April  survey also indicated  a small weakening in 
demand for both types of loans on a weighted basis.  Looking ahead, on a loan- weighted basis a 
moderate net fraction of banks anticipate reducing their exposure to residential real estate assets 
over the ne xt year.  With respect to  consumer loans, on a loan- weighted basis, moderate net 
fractions of banks reported that they had eased  standards on most  types of these  loans  over the 
past three months.  In addition, demand for all  types of consumer loans increased somewhat, on 
net, with demand for auto loans showing the largest increase. 
A large share of banks reported that they were actively soliciting applications for the 
revised Home Affordable Refinance Program, or “HARP 2.0.”  Most banks reported that they expect that a majority of the applications for the program will be approved and successfully 
completed.  Respondents also noted that a variety of factors had limited their willingness to offer 
refinancing loans through HARP 2.0.  Some of the factors cited as most important were the risk 
that the  GSE s might put back the mortgage and difficulty in securing transfer of existing private 
mortgage insurance coverage.

Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending  
A modest net fraction of domestic banks stated  that their credit standards on C&I loans to 
large and middle- market firms eased over the first q uarter of 2012.  Standards on such loans to 
small firms were reportedly little changed on balance.  However, a small net fraction of U.S.

  branches and agencies of foreign banks reportedly  tighten ed their standards on C&I loans for the 
third  consecutive quarter .  The tightening by foreign survey respondents was limited to some of 
the U.S. branches and agencies of European banks.  
Moderate to large net fraction s of domestic banks eased many terms on C&I loans to 
firms of all sizes.  A very large fraction of respondents indicated that they had decreased spreads 
on C&I loan rates over the cost of funds to both large and middle market firms and to small firms .  
The net fraction s of banks reporting these decreases are near the highest on record .  A sizeable net 
fraction of banks also indicated a reduc tion in  their use of interest rate floors.    
Almost all d omestic banks that reported having eased standards or terms on C&I loans 
cited more -aggressive competition from other banks and nonbank lenders as a reason for having 
done so, with fewer than half  of those banks attributing the change to an improved or less 
uncertain economic outlook.  The few  banks that reported having tightened at least one C&I loan 
term cited  a variety of reasons, including a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, a 
worsening of industry- specific problems, a reduced tolerance for risk,  and increased concerns 
about legislative, supervisory, or accounting policies. 
Meanwhile, a moderate net fraction of foreign survey respondents increased the costs of 
credit lines on C&I loans.  A few European respondents acknowledged an increased cost of funds due to more-expensive dollar funding.  The foreign respondents that reported having tightened 
their standards o r terms  on C&I loans cited  a variety of reasons, including a less favorable or 
more uncertain economic outlook, a worsening of industry- specific problems, a reduced tolerance 
for risk, deterioration in their current of expected liquidity position, and incr eased concerns about 
legislative, supervisory, or accounting policies. 
For the second straight survey, reports from domestic banks of stronger demand for C&I 
loans outnumbered reports of weaker demand.  About two-thirds of the  domestic respondents 
who reported competing with European banks for business noted an increase in business as a result of decreased competition from European banks and their affiliates or subsidiaries.  
Domestic banks also reported a net increase in the number of inquiries from potential business 
borrowers regarding  new or increased credit lines.  Banks reporting stronger demand cited shifts 
in borrowing from other bank and nonbank sources, as well as increases in customers’ funding 
needs related to inventories, investment in plant or equipment, accounts receivable, and mergers 
and acquisitions as important factors underlying the increase.  The small fraction of b anks 
indicating that demand had decreased cited an increase in their customers’ internally generated funds, as well as decreases in customers’ funding needs related to inventories, investment in plant 
or equipment, accounts receivable, and mergers and acquisitions.  In contrast, a small net fraction 
of foreign respondents saw weaker demand  for C&I loans, and those that did  cited customers’  
decreased investment in plant and equipment and reduced financing needs for merger or 
acquisition activity  as some of the reasons.

  Special Questions on Lending to Firms with European Exposures  
A set of special questions in the April  survey asked respondents about lending to banks 
headquartered in Europe and their affiliates or subsidiaries (regardless of the location of the 
affiliates and subsidiaries) , as well as to nonfinancial firms that have operations in the United 
States and  significant exposure to European economies (regardless of the location of the firms).  
Most of t hese questions were also asked in the previous two surveys , conducted in January 2012 
and October 2011.  
Moderate net fractions of both domestic and foreign respondents reported having 
tightened standards on loans to European banks, and small net fraction s stated  that they had also 
tightened standards on loans to nonfinancial firms that have operations in the United States and 
significant exposure to European economies.  However, i n all cases, the net fractions that 
reported having tighten ed were substantially smaller than in the January  survey.  Demand for 
credit was reportedly little changed , on net, from European banks (or their affiliates and 
subsidiaries) and from nonfinancial firms with significant European exposure s.   
Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending 
A modest net fraction of domestic banks report ed easing their standards on CRE loans in 
the April survey.  Even so, lending standards on CRE loans likely remain relatively tight:  Such 
standards were widely described in a special question in  the July 2011 survey (four  quarters ago) 
as being at or near their tightest levels since 2005 , and these standards were r eportedly little  
changed over  the previous three surveys.   Foreign survey respondents indicated that their 
standards on CRE loans  were about unchanged. 
As has been the case in recent surveys , moderate net fractions of domestic banks reported 
that demand fo r CRE loans  had strengthen ed, on net , over the past three months .  In contrast, the 
foreign respondents reported that demand for CRE loans had changed  little over that period.  The 
reported changes in standards and demand are consistent with the slower pace of decline in 
outstanding CRE loans on banks’ books in the first quarter of 2012. 
LENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS  
Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending  
Most banks continued to report little net change in standards on prime residential 
mortgage loans , when  responses are weighted by the outstanding closed-end mortgage balances 
held on the respondents’ books.  Moreover, weighted responses, which may better account for 
overall activ ity in mortgage lending given that it is highly concentrated among the largest banks,  
have also shown weaker demand.  On a weighted  basis , banks reported standards on 
nontraditional residential mortgage loans were little changed,  while a moderate net fract ion 
reported weaker demand for those loans.   
When survey responses are weighted by the amount of banks’ outstanding HELOCs, 
standards on that category of credit were little changed over the past three months.  The previous

  five surveys had shown easings o n standards for HELOCs.  M eanwhile, the demand for such 
loans continued to weaken, on net, if the responses are weighted .  The small amount of easing in 
standards and the weakness in demand are consistent with the continued runoff in banks’ holdings 
of HELOCs . 
 Special Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending  
 A set of special questions asked survey respondents about residential real estate lending 
policies at their institutions.  One such question asked banks about factors currently  affecting 
their ability to originate or purchase additional RRE loans.  Almost uniformly,  on a loan-weighted 
basis banks cited periods during which the high volume of RRE  loan applications exceed ed their  
application processing capacity as a factor.  More than half of banks cited difficulties in 
completing timely and accurate underwriting as at least somewhat of a factor, while about  
one-third of respondents reported difficulty in completing timely and accurate appraisals or in 
hiring sufficient  servicing or loan processing staff as at least somewhat of a factor.   
Banks were also asked  to compare their willingness to originate a GSE -eligible 30- year 
fixed -rate mortgage loan  intended for home purchase today with their willingness in 2006 for  
borrowers with FICO (or equivalent) credit risk scores of 620, 680, and 720, and down payments 
of 10 or 20 percent (for a total of six categories of borrowers).  When weighted by their holdings 
of RRE loans, somewhat more than half of banks indicated that they were less li kely to originate 
a GSE -eligible mortgage loan to potential borrowers with a FICO score of 620 and a 10 percent 
down payment than they were in 2006.  Raising the down payment to 20 percent reduced the fraction of banks less likely to originate such a loan to about 40 percent.  Less than 20 percent of 
banks were less likely to originate loans to borrowers with a FICO score of 680, regardless of 
down payment size, and banks were, on net, about as likely to originate loans to borrowers with a 
FICO score of 720 now as they were in 2006.  These results are broadly consistent with data showing changes between 2006 and 2011 in the number and share of loans actually originated to 
borrowers with such characteristics.   Almost all banks cited borrower s having higher costs or 
greater  difficulty in obtaining mortgage insurance coverage  as an important factor contributing to 
the reduced likelihood of originating GSE -eligible mortgage loans.  A somewhat smaller fraction 
of respondents noted the higher risk of putbacks of delinquent mortgages by the GSEs as an 
important factor ; however , that factor was listed as the most important one by the largest number 
of banks.  More than half of respondents reported higher servicing costs if mortgages were to become delinquent and less favorable or more uncertain outlooks for  house prices, or the 
economy more broadly, as important reasons.  
Several special questions asked about banks’ participation in HARP 2.0.  When weighted 
by RRE loans held in their portfolios, nearly three-fourths of banks  reported that they were 
actively soliciting HARP 2.0 applications and satisfying most demand as it came in .  A similar 
fraction reported that they anticipated that 60 percent or more of such applications would be

  approved and successfully completed.4
Looking ahead, on a portfolio- weighted basis, a moderate net fraction of banks reported 
that they anticipated reducing their exposure to RRE assets over the next year (such as RRE loans 
or government backed or other mortgage- backed securities), suggesting that, in the aggregate, the 
amount of residential mortgage loans available to consumers is likely to contract.  However, these results are attributable to the answers of a few very large banks.  O n an unweighted basis, the 
majority of banks indicated that they expected to increase th eir exposure to the residential 
mortgage market.    About three -fourths of respondents reported difficulty in 
obtaining transfers of existing private mortgage insurance coverage as a factor reducing their willingness or ability to offer additional refinance loans through HARP 2.0.  N early half of 
respondents cited difficulty in identifying junior lien holders or in obtaining resubordination of a known second lien as a factor reducing their willingness or ability to offer such loans.  
Meanw hile, only about one -third of respondents cited the risk that the GSE s might put back the 
mortgage as an at least somewhat important factor, although among all factors it was rated as the 
most important one by the largest number of respondents.  On a portfolio- weighted basis, about 
one-fourth of banks reported  that they were actively soliciting applications and satisfying most 
demand as it came in for refinancing underwater loans outside of HARP 2.0 for borrowers who 
have been current on their existing mortgage for at least 12 months. 
Questions on Consumer Lending  
As in the previous four surveys, on a portfolio-weighted basis, small fractions of 
domestic banks reported having eased standards on auto and other consumer loans.  In contrast, 
standards on credit card loans were tightened modestly.  All three loan categories saw modest 
easings of standards on an unweighted basis.  M oderate  net fractions of banks report ed having 
narrowed spreads on auto and other consumer loans.  However, o ther terms across the categories 
of consumer loans were  little changed on net.  
A moderate net fraction of banks reported stronger demand for auto loans , consistent with 
reports of notable auto loan originations in recent weekly bank credit data.  Small er net fractions 
of banks reported stronger demand for credit card  loans  and other consumer loans, although the 
net share of banks that indicated  that they experienced higher demand for other consumer loans 
increased a bit relative to the previous survey.   Net fractions for all three categories were 
somewhat larger than was the case in the January survey.  
                                                 
4 To date, HARP does not appear to have had a material effect on aggregate mortgage refinancing 
volume.  Staff will have a better measure of this effect when the April Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
prepayment data are released in early May.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY  
We continue to view the risks around our projection for economic activity as 
elevated relative to the average experience of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by 
the FOMC) .1
With regard to inflation, although we see substantial uncertainty about our 
inflation projection, we do not view these risks as unusually high.  Long -run inflation 
expectations have remained relatively stable, and  the evolution of inflation over the past 
several years has been fairly  consistent with our assessment of how anchored  inflation 
expectations, changes in the prices of crude oil and other commodities, and economic 
slack influence consumer prices.  Moreover, we continue to see the risks surrounding our 
baseline forecast as balanced.  On the downside, low levels of resource utilization, subdued increases in unit labor costs, and the possibility that economic conditions might be less favo rable than in the baseline could cause inflation to drift down over time.  On 
the upside, concerns related to the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to execute a timely exit from the current stance of policy might cause inflation to   The aftereffects of the financial crisis and subsequent recession still impart 
an unusual degree of  uncertainty regarding the level of economic slack and the future 
pace of the recovery .  However, relative to the J anuary Tealbook, when we last reported 
our assessment of  this issue, we now consider the risks around the outlook for real 
activity to be roughly balanced rather than clearly skewed to the downside.  Recent 
improvements in labor market conditions, industrial production, and consumer  spending 
increase the probability t hat a more robust recovery  than we have projected  could 
develop.  At the same time, considerable downside risks remain, most notably those associated with the European fiscal and financial situation .  Moreover, the capacity of 
U.S. fiscal or monetary polic y to counteract any weakening in economic activity is 
uncertain . 
                                                 
1 This assessment of heightened uncertainty holds even though the benchmark estimates of 
uncertainty about real activity have increased markedly over the past few years.  In  particular, as the fixed 
20-year window used to assess the typical size of forecast errors has rolled forward to include the 
pronounced volatility of the past few years, the estimated standard errors for out -year projections of the 
unemployment rate almos t doubled between 2008 and 2011, and have remained at this higher level with the 
new sample.  Thus, the benchmark estimates of uncertainty  about real activity are no longer dominated by 
the experience of the Great Moderation period.   In contrast, benchmark  estimates of uncertainty about 
inflation are essentially unchanged.

  rise, as could a sharper depreciat ion in the foreign exchange value of the dollar  or a larger 
amount of damage to the supply side of the economy.   
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternativ es to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  T he first 
scenario  considers the upside risk that the recent improvements in  some measures of 
economic activity  are early indications that the recovery will accelerate more rapidly than 
anticipated.  The second  scenario builds on the previous one by assuming that, in the 
context of a robust economic expansion, the unprecedented  size of  the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet causes inflation expectations to rise .  The third scenario examines the 
downside risk associated with a “fiscal cliff” at the beginning of 2013.  The fourth 
scenario considers the risk that the continued high level and duration of unemployment 
over the next few years lead to more -significant corrosion in the long- run productive 
capacity of the economy  than assumed in the baseline.  The fifth scenario considers the 
possibility that inflation will decline by more than we anticipate because the persistently 
wide margins of slack in labor and product markets begin to erode inflatio n expectations.  
The six th scenario analyzes the risk to the U.S. economic outlook associated with a 
severe fiscal and financial crisis in Europe that spills over to the United States and the 
rest of the  global economy.  T he last  scenario considers t he effects of a substantial 
increase in oil prices caused by  heightened geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions.   
We generate the first five  scenarios using the FRB/US model and an estimated 
policy rule for the federal funds rate  that responds to core PCE inflation and the staff’s 
estimate of economic slack .  The last two  scenarios  are generated using the multicountry 
SIGMA model  and a different policy rule that employs an alternative concept of resource 
utilization.2
Virtuous Circle    In all of the scenarios, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are 
assumed to follow their baseline paths.  
We have interpreted  the incoming economic data as consistent with a gradual 
strengthening in real activity over the next few years.   However, further declines i n the 
unemployment rate, unexpectedly large increases in  consumer spending, and the first 
                                                 
2 In the simulations using the FRB/US model, the federal funds rate follows the outcome -based 
rule described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.  In the simulations using SIGMA, the policy rule 
is broadly similar but uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s 
estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of a slow adjustment in wages and prices.

  upturn in house prices for some time could indicate that a faster -paced  recovery may be 
emerging.   This scenario assumes that a stronger self -reinforcing cycle materializes , with 
increasing optimism and declining aversion to risk leading to higher consumer 
expenditures, more hiring and investment spending by firms, and improved credit availability and overall financial condition s:  After several years during which it h as been 
a drag on activity, the financial accelerator shifts into forward gear.  This virtuous circle causes real GDP to rise at an annual rate of 3 ¾ percent on average until 2014, roughly  
1 percentage point higher than in baseline.  As a result, the unemployment rate declines  
to 6¼ percent by the end of 2014, 1 percentage point below baseline.  Upward pressure on inflation is initially tempered by the effects of the higher level of capital investment on labor productivity and unit labor costs, along with w ell-anchored long-run inflation 
expectations.  Over time, however, tighter labor and product markets cause inflation to move noticeably above baseline.  In response to the stronger pace of real activity, the federal funds rate begins to rise in the second half of this year.  
Virtuous Circle with Higher Inflation  
In the previous scenario, we assumed that long-run inflation expectations would 
remain well anchored despite a fairly sizable acceleration in real economic activity.  However, in the context of a fa ster recovery, the unprecedented size of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet and the excess reserves held by banks could fuel an expansion in lending large enough to spark concerns about the ability of monetary policy to react in a timely manner to keep in flation pressures in check.  Reflecting these concerns, this 
scenario builds on the previous one by assuming that long-run inflation expectations rise to 2¾ percent by the end of next year, causing headline inflation to reach 2½ percent by 
2014 and 3 percent thereafter .  In response to higher inflation, the federal funds rate rises 
more steeply and  is 1 percentage point higher in both 2014 and 2015 than it was in the 
previous scenario.  With tighter monetary policy, the growth rate of real activity by  the 
middle of the decade is  somewhat more restrained and the unemployment rate ends up at  
5¾ percent by the end of 2017, almost ½ percentage point higher than in the pr eceding  
scenario.   
Fiscal Cliff 
Our baseline projection assumes that most expiring  federal  tax provisions— 
including the tax cuts initially enacted in  2001 and 2003, relief for most taxpayers from 
the Alternative Minimum Tax , and  a number of other non- stimulus -related tax 
reductions—will be extended by  the end of this year.  In contrast, t his scenario assum es

  that all of these tax provisions are allowed to expire next year , increasing household and 
business tax payments by a total of about 2 percent of GDP  relative to baseline .  In 
addition, the automatic spending cuts required by the sequestration associated with  the 
Budget Control Act take full effect in 2013 rather than being phased  in gradually as  
assumed  in the baseline, thereby restrain ing federal purchases by  ¼ percent of GDP 
relative to baseline .3  Moreover, t hese developments, in conjunction with the politic al 
wrangling likely to surround the raising of the federal debt limit late in the year, are 
assumed to weigh on consumer and business confidence.  All told , real GDP  expands 
only 1½ percent in 2013 and 2¾ percent in 2014, on average 1 per centage point  per year 
slower than in the baseline.4
Corrosion   As a result, the unemployment rate is still above 8 percent 
at the end of 2014.  With a wider margin of slack in both labor and product markets, 
inflation edges down to 1¼ percent in 2014, and the federal funds rate does not begin to 
increase until early 2015 .   
Our baseline projection assumes that the persistence of a wide margin of slack in 
labor markets will not appreciably reduce future expansion of the productive capacity of 
the economy.  In this scenario, the continued underutilization of labor resources begin s to 
significantly erode the skills and labor force attachment of unemployed workers while 
intensifying the mismatch in the labor market .  In particular , the NAIRU  rises  from its 
assumed current level of 6 percent  to 7 percent by the end of 2014, 1 percentage point 
above baseline ; the NAIRU remains at 7  percent thereafter .  In addition, the trend labor 
force participation rate falls steadily to 63 percent by the end of 2014, 1 percentage point below baseline.  Th is greater  labor market  damage reduces the level of potential output 
by 2 percent  by the end of 2014 relative to baseline .  Under these conditions, real GDP 
rises at an average annual rate of only a little more than 2 percent th rough the middle of 
the decade as households and businesses recognize the weaker trajectory of income and earnings .  The expansion in aggregate demand is sufficiently weak  that the 
unemployment rate remains above 8 percent through 2016.  As a result, econo mic slack is 
on average little different from baseline despite the more -pronounced deterioration in the 
supply-side conditions of the economy , so inflation is only slightly higher .  With both the 
                                                 
3 After 2014, both tax rate s and government spending gradually return to their baseline 
trajectories, leading eventually to budget deficits that are about the same as in the baseline but resulting in a 
lower ratio of government debt to GDP . 
4 Although taxes increase by 2 percent of GDP, the effects on spending are considerably smaller in 
the short run as households  in the FRB/US model  adjust their spending only gradually to changes in 
disposable  income .

  amount of slack and  inflation similar to the baseline, the p ath for the federal funds rate is 
also comparable to the baseline. 
Disinflation  
The stability of various measures of expected inflation may be misleading us 
about the potential for further disinflation, particularly in the context of a baseline 
outlook in which a considerable margin of slack in labor and product markets persists for some time.   In this scenario, both expected and actual inflation drift down over ti me, with 
core PCE inflation falling to below ½ percent  by 2014; such declines would be in line 
with the predictions of some accelerationist Phillips curve  models.  As inflation slows, 
financial market participants  are assumed to become increasingly concerned that  the 
economy could fall into persistent  deflation; as a result, bond premiums increase, which 
restrains spending modestly and raises  unemployment relative to baseline.  In response to 
lower inflation and greater economic slack, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound until the end of 2015.  
European Crisis with Severe Spillovers  
In this scenario, the recent slippage in European financial market conditions 
presages an even sharper downturn, and Europe plunges into a severe financial crisis and a deep recession.  This outcome could result from some combination of a disorde rly 
sovereign default, the failure of a large European financial institution, and  a loss of 
confidence by the public in the ability of European governments to resolve the crisis.  Reflecting this stress, both sovereign and private borrowing costs in Europe soar —with 
corporate bond spreads rising 400 basis points above baseline—and the confidence of households and businesses plummets.  Real GDP in Europe declines more than 8 percent relative to baseline by the end of 2013, notwithstanding a 20 percent deprec iation in the 
real effective foreign exchange value of the euro.  Europe’s difficulties are assumed to 
have important financial and economic spillovers to other parts of the world, including the United States.  U.S. economic activity contracts sharply in response to a widening of U.S. corporate bond spreads  of more than 300 basis points, a much weaker stock market, 
reduced access to credit, and an erosion in household and business confidence.  In 
addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger e xchange value of the dollar 
depress U.S. net exports.  All told, U.S. real GDP declines at an annual rate of 2¾ percent 
in the second half of this year and falls 1½ percent more in 2013.  The unemployment 
rate climbs to 10½ percent in 2014 before gradually receding.  With substantially greater resource slack and lower import prices, overall U.S. consumer price inflation dips below

  zero in the second half of 2012 and in 2013; inflation turns positive in 2014 as an 
economic recovery begins to take hold.5
Higher Oil Prices    Und er these conditions, the federal funds rate 
remains near zero until the second half of 2016.  
The continued tension with Iran over its nuclear program highlights the 
significant upside risks to our outlook for oil prices.  In this scenario, we assume that 
geopolitical developments and supply disruptions temporarily push oil prices  $50 per barrel above baseline in the current quarter, but that oil prices gradually recede thereafter.  Although a supply-driven increase in oil prices would or dinarily be expected 
to cause the dollar to depreciate, we assume instead that heightened geopolitical tensions 
increase the demand for dollar -denominated assets and cause the dollar to appreciate 
slightly.  U.S. domestic demand falls relative to baseline because higher oil prices 
effectively reduce the real incomes of households and lower the return on firms’ investments, while real exports also decline due to weaker foreign economic activity.  All 
told, U.S. real GDP rises only about 2 percent, on average, this year and next, and the unemployment rate remains elevated,  ending 2014 at 8 percent, ½ percentage point 
higher than in the baseline.   Reflecting the rise in energy costs, overall PCE inflation 
averages  3½ percent this year but then moderates as oil prices begin to decline.  Core 
inflation is boosted modestly relative to baseline for several years  as firms pass on their 
higher production costs to consumers. Although the liftoff of the federal funds rate is 
unchanged from baseline, the removal of mone tary accommodation thereafter proceeds a 
bit more gradually.  
OUTSIDE  FORECASTS   
In the April 10 report (which was based on responses collected on April 4 and 5 
before the release of the most recent labor market report), the Blue Chip consensus projection showed real GDP rising 2.4 percent over the four quarters of 2012 and increasing 2.7  percent in 2013, both similar to  the staff forecast.  The Blue Chip 
                                                 
5 The rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects t he forward -looking 
nature of inflation determination in SIGMA.  In particular, long -run inflation expectations remain firmly 
anchored at 2 percent, producer marginal costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, and 
productivity is weaker (reflecting  reduced capital spending).  In addition, import price inflation runs 
significantly higher than in the baseline as the dollar’s initial appreciation is gradually reversed.  Under 
alternative specifications of SIGMA that, for instance, allow for more struct ural persistence in the inflation 
process or a less -firm anchoring of inflation expectations, inflation would remain low for a longer period.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaledby real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for changein HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
