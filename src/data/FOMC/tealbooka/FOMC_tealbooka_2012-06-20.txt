Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
We have downgraded our assessment of the pace of real GDP growth since the 
April Tealbook.  With regard to the first half of th is year, this revisi on in view reflects 
weaker-than-expected incoming indicators of  government purchases (both federal and 
state and local) and net exports.  Our revised es timate of real GDP growth in the first half 
of this year—at 1¾ percent at  an annual rate—is ½ percenta ge point below our previous 
forecast. 
With regard to the second half of this year and beyond, the most important 
development has been the darkening in the global outlook and the greater restraint on the 
domestic economy that it portends.  In part icular, as discussed in the International 
Economic Developments and Outlook section, we now assume that the situation in 
Europe will deteriorate significantly until late th is year and that it will begin to improve 
thereafter.  Some of the asso ciated restraint on aggregate de mand is anticipated to operate 
through the familiar trade channel, but some is likely to arise from financial spillovers, which are already at work raising risk pr emiums, depressing U.S. equity prices and 
weakening business confidence.  To be sure, th ere are some offsets:  The same flight-to-
safety asset demands that have elevated the dollar have also served to depress Treasury 
yields, residential mortgage rates, and borrowing rates for some investment-grade firms; 
in addition, oil prices have declined, boosting the purchasing power of household 
incomes.  However, these buffering influences are comparatively modest in effect.   
Other factors corroborating a weaker a ssessment of real activity include the 
downward revisions to the BEA’s estimates of personal income in recent quarters, which point to less support for household spending going forward; the slower-than-expected 
pace of private-sector job gains in the pa st few months; and the noticeably softer 
trajectory of industrial production in the second qu arter than we had expected.  In all, we 
now project real GDP to e xpand about 2 percent in 2012 and 2¼ percent over 2013, down 
½ percentage point in both years from the April Tealbook.  In 2014, with the drag from 
fiscal policy receding and the European situa tion anticipated to have stabilized, we see 
real GDP accelerating to about 3 percent, materially above the rate of growth of potential output, but still ¼ percentage point less than what we wrote down for the April Tealbook.

 With growth in real GDP expected to be close to that of potential output through 
2013, no material progress is made on reducing the slack in labor markets until late in the 
forecast period.  We project that the jobless ra te will edge down just ¼ percentage point 
to 8 percent by the end of 2013, but even that  slight decline is attributable, in our 
reckoning, to the expiration of emergency unemployment benefits; the unemployment 
rate then falls to 7¾ percent by the end of 2014.  Over the fo recast period as a whole, the 
unemployment rate averages ¼ percentage po int higher than in the previous Tealbook. 
The fundamental inflation picture remains as  it has for some time:  With slack in 
labor and product markets expected to stay pe rsistently elevated, but long-term inflation 
expectations remaining well anchored, our baseline inflation forecast is running 
somewhat below 2 percent over the medium term.  Relative to the April Tealbook, we 
have revised down our forecast for headline PC E inflation, largely as a consequence of 
the sharply lower price of crude oil.  For this  year, we now predict h eadline prices to rise 
1.2 percent, down from 1.9 percent in April; w ith oil prices forecast to decline a bit 
further in both years, headline inflation r uns a bit below core inflation in 2013 and 2014, 
at 1.5 percent.  Core inflation in this forecas t is just a touch below what we wrote down in 
the April Tealbook. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
Consistent with a mechanical reading of  the estimated outcome-based policy rule, 
we assume that liftoff of the target federa l funds rate from its effective lower bound will 
occur in the third quarter of 2014.1  This liftoff occurs two quarters later than in the April 
Tealbook, reflecting the weaker economic outlook  in this projection.  We also assume 
that the Committee will maintain the Federal Reserve’s current portf olio-related policies, 
with the timing adjusted to corres pond with the revised liftoff date. 
The path of the federal funds rate in th e baseline projection is  sensitive to the 
choice of policy rule.  As discussed in Book B,  had we instead determined the trajectory 
of the federal funds rate using the Taylor (1999) rule, liftoff would occur in 2014:Q4.  
But using a rule that targets the level of nominal GDP would delay the onset of 
conventional tightening until 2015:Q2, while an  optimal-control exercise indicates a

 postponement until 2016:Q2.2  In contrast, the Taylor (1993 ) rule and the first-difference 
rule call for firming to begin earlier than unde r the outcome-based rule; in fact, the Taylor 
(1993) rule prescribes increasing the federal f unds rate immediately.3 
Other Interest Rates 
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities  has declined about 40 basis points, on 
net, since the April Tealbook.  Part of the decline in rates stems from weaker-than-
expected economic news and c oncerns about Europe that cau sed investors to shift their 
demands toward relatively safe assets and to expect a more accommodative stance of 
future monetary policy.  We nonetheless continue to expect the 10-year Treasury yield to 
rise substantially, bringing the rate to ar ound 3½ percent by late 2014.  As always, this 
projection reflects the movement  of the valuation window through the period of near-zero 
short-term interest rates along with a gra dual waning of the eff ects of nonconventional 
monetary policy.  It also assumes the eventu al unwinding of the flight-to-safety demands 
that we believe are depressing Treasury rates currently, as apprehensions related to the 
European financial crisis abate and the durab ility of the U.S. economic recovery becomes 
more assured.  All told, the pa th of this yield over the next 2½ years is about 60 basis 
points lower on average than we  had assumed in April.   
Yields on investment-grade corporat e bonds also fell over the intermeeting 
period, albeit by not as much as did Treasury yields.  We have carried forward this 
widening of spreads for a time, but the BBB bond  rate still averages about 35 basis points 
lower in this forecast than in the previous one.  In contrast, conventional mortgage rates 
have moved roughly in tandem w ith Treasury rates and are expected to continue to do so.     
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
Broad U.S. stock price indexes have decr eased about 5¼ percent,  on net, since the 
April Tealbook.  We now project that stock prices will rise only modestly through the 
second half of 2012, as tensions in financia l markets remain elevated.  With these 
                                                 
2 The optimal-control policy noted in the text is conducted under the admittedly strong assumption 
that, if economic conditions were to evolve as ex pected, future Committees would honor the commitment 
to carry out the plan deemed opti mal today rather than opportunistically reoptimizing.  If future 
Committees were instead assumed to reoptimize—th at is, follow the discretionary policy—then the 
optimal-control liftoff date would shift back to 2015:Q2 and the associated losses would be higher. 
3 All of these estimates allow for dynamic feedback  from the stance of monetary policy to the real 
economy and inflation, which can have important implications for the estimated timing of tightening under 
the different rules.

 tensions anticipated to ease thereafter, equity  prices are projected to rise at an average 
annual rate of about 10 percent in 2013 and 2014.  
The CoreLogic house price index increased in March and April by more than we 
had anticipated.  In response, we have revised up our forecast for hous e prices in the near 
term and now project them to rise 4¾ per cent in 2012, about 3 percentage points more 
than in the April Tealbook.  We  expect increases in house pric es to moderate in 2013 and 
2014, consistent with the modest pace of  the overall economic recovery and the 
anticipated increase in the number of  foreclosed homes listed for sale. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are essentially unchanged in this forecast and 
continue to imply that federal fiscal polic y will exert a substantial drag on economic 
activity over the medium term.  In particular, we still assume that the temporary payroll 
tax cut and the Emergency Unemployment Co mpensation (EUC) program will expire at 
the beginning of next year, as scheduled under current law.  We also  continue to assume 
that federal discretionary spending will be restrained by the caps set in the Budget 
Control Act and by reductions in defense sp ending as overseas military operations are 
wound down further.  However, the additional cu ts slated to take e ffect in January 2013 
under the automatic sequ estration stipulated by the Budget Control Act are assumed to be 
replaced by more-gradual budget measures that  achieve the same amount of cumulative 
deficit reduction through fiscal  year 2021.  We have also maintained our assumption that 
most expiring federal tax pr ovisions—including the tax cuts  initially enacted in 2001 and 
2003, relief for most taxpayers from the alte rnative minimum tax, and a number of other 
non-stimulus-related tax reductions—will not be allo wed to expire at the end of this year 
but instead will be eventually extended.4   
The legislative process for extending th ese tax cuts, along with replacing the 
automatic spending sequestration with deficit reduction measures that are more gradual, 
is likely to be contentious and protracted.  Indeed the baseline projection embodies the 
likelihood that the process for reaching agreement will involve a number of short-term 
extensions at the end of this year and in 2013.  This legislative wrangling is assumed to 
weigh on household and business confidence in early 2013. 
                                                 
4 An alternative scenario that assumes that all of these tax provisions are allowed to expire, and 
that the automatic discretionary spending sequestration takes full effect, is presented in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section of this Tealbook.

 We project that, in aggregate, fiscal polic y will directly restrain  the rate of real 
GDP growth (excluding multiplier effects) by ½ percentage point this year, 1 percentage 
point in 2013, and ¼ percentage point in 2014.  Fiscal restraint in 2012 is somewhat 
greater than in the April T ealbook, largely reflecting surprisingly low spending both by 
the Department of Defense and by state and local governments.  (See the box “State and 
Local Government Fiscal Conditions.”)  In light of overall fiscal restraint and folding in 
an anticipated pickup in tax r eceipts as the economic recove ry strengthens, we project 
that the federal budget deficit will narrow from $1.1 trillion (7¼ percent of GDP) in fiscal 
2012 to about $700 billion (4 percent of GDP) in  fiscal 2014, much the same as in our 
previous projection.  
The Dollar and Foreign Activity  
Since the time of the April Tealbook, th e nominal exchange value of the dollar 
has moved up significantly, and we expect the dollar to continue to appreciate into the 
fourth quarter of 2012, consistent with our a ssumption that the fina ncial stresses in the 
euro area will increase further this year.  Ther eafter, we assume that the dollar depreciates 
in real terms at about a 3¼ percent annua l rate through the end of 2014—1 percentage 
point more rapidly than prev iously projected—reflecting bo th the gradual abatement of 
financial stresses that pushed  up the dollar earlier as well as a resumption of the trend 
decline of the dollar against emerging market currencies.  The depreciation 
notwithstanding, the level of th e real dollar remains about 2 percent higher at the end of 
the forecast period than we thought in April. 
We estimate that foreign real GDP increased at an annual rate of only 2½ percent 
in the second quarter, ½ percentage poin t less than in the April Tealbook, reflecting 
weaker-than-expected recent economic data in a number of economies, including China, 
and increased financial stresses in Europe.  The expected persisten ce of the crisis in 
Europe, together with the weaker U.S. outlook, has led us to revise down foreign growth through the medium term as well.  We now forecast foreign activity to expand at an annualized pace of about 2½ percen t in the second half of th is year and 2¾ percent in 
2013.  In 2014, economic growth picks up to 3¼ percent as foreign financial conditions improve and the U.S. recovery firms.  Our assumption that financial stresses emanating 
from Europe will be begin to recede around y ear-end is a critical factor shaping this

 State and Local  Government  Fiscal Conditions  
The overall fiscal  condition  of state and  local governments  is slowly improving, 
although  their budgets remain under significant  strain.  State government  budgets 
appear to have stabilized  more than local government  budgets have, as state tax  
receipts—primarily  from income and sales taxes—have  continued  to rise solidly 
with the economic  recovery (the  black line in the lower‐left figure).  As a result, 
only a few states  reported  mid‐ year budget  shortfalls  during fiscal year 2012  (which 
ends on June 30 in most states).  In contrast,  over the  preceding  three fiscal  years, 
many states were forced to make sizable  mid‐year budget cuts.   Nevertheless,  
nominal state tax revenue only recently returned to its 2008 peak,  and reserve 
funds remain depleted  in many states.  At the local  level (the red  line in the lower‐
left figure), property  taxes—the largest  source of  tax revenue for these  
governments—moved  sideways  in 2010 and 2011 as downward  pressure  from the 
lagged effects of the fall in real estate  prices has been stemmed  by increases  in 
property tax rates.  Local  governments  have also seen reductions  in grants‐in‐aid 
from state governments  as the states have passed a portion  of their budget strain 
down to the local level.  Finally,  the stimulus grants‐in‐aid to both states and 
localities from the federal government  were mostly phased out by the end of 2011. 
 
States and localities  have continued  to trim their payrolls.   However,  as shown in  
the lower‐ right figure, the  pace of job losses has eased significantly  thus far this 
year after  state and  local employment  had cumulatively  declined  by around 
600,000 over the  preceding  three and  a half years, a reduction equal to 3 percent  
of the sector’s workforce.  As  employee compensation  is the largest single 
expense for these governments,  the slowing in job losses is consistent  with easing  
budget pressure. 
 In contrast  to the slowing pace of job cuts, state and  local governments  have 
continued  to sharply decrease  their capital expenditures.   As shown in  the lower‐
left figure on the next page, real construction  outlays have fallen more  than 
20 percent from their 2007 peak and currently  stand at their lowest levels since the 
mid‐1990s.  Capital budgets are exempt from the balanced  budget requirements  
that typically restrict states and localities  from issuing bonds to finance  current

 operations,  and conditions  in the municipal  bond market are generally  
accommodative.1  Thus, the pullback in construction  spending  likely does not 
reflect constraints  on borrowing  but, instead, tightness  in operating  budgets:   New 
construction  often requires an increase in  operating  expenditures  once the project 
is complete  (for example,  a new school building not replacing  an existing  one 
requires hiring additional  staff), and  debt service payments  are made out of 
operating  budgets.   Similarly, policymakers may  be shoring up operating  budgets 
by diverting  taxes and fees typically earmarked  for capital  accounts.  
 
Medicaid  outlays, which account  for nearly  one‐fourth of state government  
expenditures,  rose rapidly in the aftermath  of the recession  as demand for the 
program surged (not shown).  In recent quarters,  though, these outlays  have been 
subdued,  likely attributable to improving  economic  conditions  slowing the growth 
in caseloads  and aggressive  cost containment  measures  adopted  by the states.  
This easing in the growth of Medicaid  expenditures  should help reduce the 
pressure on other areas of state  budgets.2 
 Looking ahead, we expect state and  local government  spending  to recover only  
gradually.   Although  state budgets  should continue  to be bolstered  by rising tax 
revenues,  local property  tax revenue is projected  to remain  subdued  for several 
more years.  Furthermore,  given the severity of the current fiscal  strains, 
governments  are likely to be cautious  and emphasize replenishing  depleted  
reserve funds before ramping up spending.   As shown in  the lower‐ right figure, we  
project that real  purchases  by state and  local governments  will be a moderate drag  
on real GDP growth  this year, a roughly  neutral factor in 2013, and provide only a 
modest boost in 2014. 
  
 
                                                 
1 Consistent  with the plunge in construction  outlays, state and local debt has decelerated  
markedly  since the start of the recession  and posted a small decline in 2011. 
2 In the NIPA, state Medicaid  expenditures  are booked as personal transfer payments  and 
Medicaid  health services show up primarily in personal consumption  expenditures.  Thus,  state 
Medicaid  expenditures  are not included in the contribution  of state and local government  real 
purchases  to the growth in real GDP (shown in the lower‐right  figure).

 outlook.  But both the trajectory of the crisis  in Europe and its potential spillovers—and 
hence the global outlook—are extremely uncertain.5 
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
Oil prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks, with the spot price of Brent crude 
oil closing on June 12 at $97 per barrel, down over $20 since the time of the April 
Tealbook.6  The decline in prices appears to re flect increasing pessimism regarding the 
strength of global growth as well as the recen t rise in the dollar.  In addition, increased 
crude oil production in Saudi Arabia—which  has raised Saudi output to near-record 
levels since the beginning of the year—and some easing of geopolitical tensions 
associated with Iran have also likely been in  play, reducing oil prices more than the prices 
of other commodities (discussed later).  Futu res prices over the Tealbook forecast period 
have also moved lower, but not by as much as spot prices.  As a result, the Brent futures 
curve is now flatter than before; even so, it remains downward sloping.  Our forecast for 
the price of imported o il has also shifted down.7  Specifically, we project the price of 
imported oil to drop sharply from $105 per barrel in the current qua rter to about $88 per 
barrel in the third quarter and then to dec line further over the rema inder of the Tealbook 
forecast to end 2014 at $86 per barrel, about $12 below the level projected in the April 
Tealbook.   
A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices  has fallen over 2 percent since the 
April Tealbook, with prices of metals recording some of the largest declines.  The recent 
appreciation of the dollar and growing concerns over the strength of global demand have 
likely played a role in the fall in commodity  prices.  For the remainder of the forecast 
period we expect nonfuel commodity prices to re main almost flat, a trajectory that is in 
line with quotes from futures markets.   
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
We project that real GDP growth will slow  from an annual rate of 2¼ percent in 
the first quarter to about 1¾ percent in the second and third quarte rs, on average, about 
                                                 
5 An alternative scenario that has the situation in  Europe deteriorating to a much greater extent 
than in our baseline forecast is presented in the Risks and Uncertainty sect ion of this Tealbook.  
6 The spot price of WTI crude oil closed on June 12 at $83 per barrel, also about $20 lower than at 
the time of the April Tealbook.   
7 In addition to the decline in futures prices, our lower forecast for the price of imported oil also 
incorporates a negative adjustment to the futures curve, reflecting our more pessimistic outlook for global 
growth compared with outside forecasters.

 ½ percentage point less than in the Ap ril Tealbook.  The revision reflects the 
disappointing news on retail sales, job growth, personal income, government spending, 
and—as recent adverse developments in Euro pe start to show through—a more negative 
outlook for net exports.      
The Labor Market 
After improving significantly during the late fall and wi nter, the labor market has 
essentially moved sideways over the past few months, with private payrolls posting 
mediocre gains and the unemployment rate leveling out.  
Private payroll employment rose only  100,000 per month in the three months 
ending in May, compared with about 250,000 per month in the previous three months.  
While some of this slowing likely reflects payback from the warm winter weather and 
distortions to seasonal adjustment related to  the sharp employment declines in late 2008 
and early 2009, the underlying pace of employment  growth appears to have slowed this 
spring—and by more than we had been projecting in the April Tealbook.  The unemployment rate edged up in May, and at 8.2 percent, stood just 0.1 percentage point 
below its level in January of this year.  In itial claims for unemployment insurance have 
been running at a pace consistent with onl y modest job gains in coming months.    
Taken together, the recent data on the la bor market and our less favorable outlook 
for the broader economy have led us to weak en our near-term forecast for employment 
and the unemployment rate.  We now expect private payrolls to rise at an average 
monthly rate of about 115,000 throug h the end of the third quarter.
8  Abstracting from 
weather-related and seasonal factors, this pace represen ts no acceleration from the 
average over the past three months and is  about 65,000 per month below our forecast in 
the April Tealbook.  We expect the unemploy ment rate to remain near its current 
8.2 percent level during the third quarter rath er than edging down as in our previous 
projection.  
                                                 
8 Our forecast assumes that distortion of seasonal adjustment factors owing to the timing of the 
steep employment losses during the recession will subtract an average of 15,000 per month from the change 
in private employment over the near term.  We think that payback from the effects of the warm winter 
weather is now complete and will have no effect on employment growth over the remainder of the near 
term.  Seasonal adjustment distortions are not thought to have affected the unemployment rate.

 The Industrial Sector 
After having increased at an annual rate of  nearly 10 percent in  the first quarter, 
manufacturing output is projec ted to decelerate sharply to a 1¾ percent pace in the 
second quarter.  In part, the slowing reflect s the pattern of moto r vehicle assemblies, 
which jumped more than 800,000 units to an an nual rate of 9.8 million units in the first 
quarter and appear on track to rise by a sm aller amount at a 10.2 million unit pace in the 
second quarter.  However, the larger influen ce is a sharp decelera tion outside of motor 
vehicles where production was about flat, on net, in March and April and, given the 
reported drop in production-worker hours, likel y fell in May; we think the softening in 
the last few months cannot be fully written off to special factors.  Looking ahead, motor 
vehicle assemblies are projected to remain near their second-quarter pace in coming 
months, while near-term indicato rs of industrial activity, such  as the various regional and 
national surveys of purchasing managers, point to modest gains.  Accordingly, we expect 
manufacturing output to rise at  an annual rate of about 2¾ percent in the third quarter. 
Household Spending 
The incoming data on retail sales suggest that real PCE is on track to rise at a 
2 percent annual rate in the sec ond quarter after a brisk 3 percen t gain in the first quarter.  
On average, growth in the first half was close to what we wrote down in the April 
Tealbook.  Meanwhile, the recent news on disposable personal income (DPI) has been 
disappointing.  Indeed, over the four quart ers ending in 2012:Q1, the BEA now estimates 
that real DPI edged up a meager ¼ percent, n early ½ percentage point  less than expected 
at the time of the April Tealbook.9  The downward surprise in  energy prices since the 
previous Tealbook was sufficient to prevent us from revising down our forecast for the 
growth  of real DPI in the near term despite the slower pace of job gains that we now 
project; nonetheless, the level  of real DPI remains below our forecast in the April 
Tealbook.  In total, we now expect real PC E growth of 2½ percent pace in the third 
quarter, about ½ percentage point lower th an in our previous forecast.      
Housing activity appears to be on a gradua l uptrend, albeit from a very depressed 
level.  Smoothing as best we can through the volatility associated with the unseasonably 
warm weather earlier in the year, single-family housing starts and permits look to have moved up a little from their levels late last year.  In addition, some signs indicate that 
                                                 
9 The lower estimate for the growth  of real DPI over this period largely reflects a substantial 
downward revision to compensation in the fourth quarter of last year—a revision that was informed by the 
data derived from state unemployment insurance systems.

 housing demand is slowly improving:  Both new and existing home sales have been 
edging up since last summer, and measures of house prices have turned up in recent 
months.  Nonetheless, given the ongoing re straint on demand from difficult credit 
conditions and uncertainty about employment and income prospects, as well as the 
likelihood that the abundant stock of relativ ely inexpensive vacant houses will divert 
demand from new construction, we  project single-family starts  to increase only slightly 
over the near term.    
In contrast, construction activity in th e multifamily sector has picked up more 
rapidly, likely in response to rising rents and falling vacancy rates.  With the factors 
restraining home purchases expe cted to add further to the demand for rental apartments, 
we project multifamily starts to continue to move up in coming months.    
Business Investment  
After rising at a double-digit ra te in the second half of last year, real spending on 
equipment and software decelerated to an a nnual rate of 3¾ percent in the first quarter, 
and we expect it to continue to rise at about this pace, on average, in the second and third quarters.  Our near-term forecast is somewhat weaker than in the April Tealbook, partly 
reflecting weaker-than-expected data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital 
goods and lower levels of business purchases of motor vehicles.  In addition, forward-
looking indicators of investment demand, incl uding surveys of business sentiment and 
capital spending plans, have softened recently. 
Following a period of surprising strength  through much of 2011, incoming data 
suggest that spending on nonresidential constr uction (excluding drilling and mining) will 
rise only modestly in the first half of this ye ar.  Such a deceleration would be in line with 
the sector’s fundamentals.  Although ther e are hints of some easing in financing 
conditions for existing commercial real estate, we anticipate that high vacancy rates, low 
commercial real estate prices, and difficult financing conditions for new construction will 
continue to put downward pressure on build ing activity for the foreseeable future.  
Meanwhile, after brisk increases over the past two years, investment in the drilling and 
mining sector fell sharply in the first quarter , a drop that is probabl y related to the low 
level of natural gas prices.  Outlays for dril ling and mining structures  are expected to fall 
a bit further in the second and third quarters as the recent drop in oil prices further curbs 
the incentive to invest.

 In the aggregate, firms in the nonfarm business sector are forecast to build 
inventories in the first half of  this year at a pace a little a bove that in the fourth quarter, 
broadly consistent with the m oderate trajectory of final sale s growth.  Estimates from the 
staff’s flow-of-goods system, book-value measures  of inventory-to-sal es ratios, reports 
on dealer inventories of motor vehicles, and surveys of private inve ntory satisfaction and 
plans, all point to stocks that are fairly well aligned with sales.  Looking ahead, with 
producers thought to be appreh ensive about accumulating ex cess inventories in the face 
of uncertainty about the sust ainability of the recovery, the pace of stockbuilding is 
projected to rise slowly and to add only modestly to GDP growth in the near term.  
Government  
Real federal purchases fell at an annual ra te of 6 percent in the first quarter, led by 
a surprisingly large drop in defense expenditu res.  Moreover, monthly Treasury data for 
spending through May point to a slightly greater-than-expected  decline in real federal 
purchases in the second quarter.  We anticip ate that the downtrend in expenditures will 
continue over the second half of the year, alt hough at a slower pace than in the first half.  
In the state and local sector, the incoming data have also be en weaker, on balance, than 
we had expected.  Although state and local payrolls have only ticked down, on net, thus 
far this year—about as anticipated—constr uction spending by these governments through 
April was weaker than expected.  In addi tion, the BEA’s estimate of the remaining 
components of state and local purchases in the first quarter was much weaker than 
anticipated, and we have carried some of th is surprise forward.  All told, total real 
government purchases are expected to subtract almost ½ percentage point from the rate of 
real GDP growth this year, about double what we had written down in the April 
Tealbook.  
Foreign Trade  
Real exports of goods and services are exp ected to increase at a 4 percent pace in 
the second and third quarters.  Relative to the April Teal book, this projection is down 
about 1½ percentage points, reflecting both the weaker outlook for foreign growth and the higher exchange value of the dollar.  Real imports are projected to expand 5 percent on average in the second and thir d quarters, a rate in line with  the relatively modest pace 
of U.S. demand growth.  All to ld, the external sector is now  expected to subtract about 
¼ percentage point from the gr owth of real GDP in the seco nd quarter and ½ percentage 
point in the third quarter, a greater drag th an in the previous T ealbook on account of the 
downward revision to export growth.

 Prices and Wages  
Total PCE price inflation is expected to sl ow from an annual rate of 2½ percent in 
the first quarter to about ½ pe rcent in the second quarter and essentially zero in the third 
quarter.  The projected step-down in headline in flation is significantly larger than in the 
April Tealbook and is driven primarily by an  unexpected steep drop in consumer energy 
prices.  After having risen steadily  over the first three months of  this year, crude oil prices 
have tumbled since April, and gasoline prices have declined roughly in line with crude 
costs.  As a result, PCE energy prices are now expected to fall at an  annual rate of more 
than 15 percent in both the second and third quarters.  Consumer food price inflation has 
slowed noticeably in recent months but no mo re than expected, as the upward pressure 
from last year’s jump in farm commodity prices appears to have largely dissipated.  
 Meanwhile, core PCE prices are expected to increase at an annual rate of about 
1¾ percent over the second and third quarters, just a bit below the 2 percent annual pace 
recorded in the first quarter.  As of this writing, the incoming data on prices have come in about as we were expecting, a nd thus our near-term forecast for core price inflation is 
little changed from before.   
The incoming data on labor compensation ha ve been weaker than anticipated.  
Estimates of hourly compensation in the nonfar m business sector in the fourth and first 
quarters were revised down to show no cha nge on net.  In addition, the readings on 
average hourly earnings for April and May surprised us to the downside.  In light of this information, we have shaved our proj ection for annualized growth in hourly 
compensation to 1¾ percent over the second a nd third quarters.  Likewise, the first-
quarter reading on compensation from the em ployment cost index (ECI) was somewhat 
lower than we were expecting, and we have marked down our forecast in the second and 
third quarters in response.  The revisions to  compensation growth in the fourth and first 
quarters reduced the level in unit labor costs in the first quarter roughly 1½ percent relative to the April Tealbook.  We  project unit labor costs will  increase at an annual rate 
of about 1 percent over the second and third quarters, a bit slower than previously 
forecast.   
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
The broad contour of the medium-term projection is noticeably more subdued 
than in the April Tealbook, largely the result of the less hospitable foreign conditions and 
the associated higher exchange value of the dollar and reduced level of equity prices.

 Long-term interest rates in the United Stat es and global oil prices  have moved sharply 
lower, largely reflecting the events in Europe ; these factors cushion the effects from the 
dollar and the stock market but are not enough, in  our estimation, to offset them.  Finally, 
we have once again trimmed our estimate of the level and growth rate of potential output 
in response to labor market developments and overall output growth over the past few 
quarters; in the medium-term forecast, the lowe r projected growth rate of potential output 
is allowed to show throu gh to actual GDP growth.  
The gloomy news notwithstanding, we con tinue to project a modest acceleration, 
on average, in real GDP over the forecas t period, with the expansion supported by 
accommodative monetary policy, an eventual containment of the financial crisis in 
Europe, improving financial conditions, and incr easing credit availabi lity.  Still, these 
influences are not sufficient, in our projec tion, to produce a rapid turnaround in activity, 
and with the drag from fiscal policy expected to increase next year, real GDP growth 
does not materially exceed the grow th rate of potential until 2014.   All told, real GDP is 
projected to increase about 2¼ percent in 2013 before picking up to a touch over 
3 percent in 2014.   
We see the expansion in aggregate demand through 2013 as too weak to make 
much headway in reducing the unemployment rate.  Our projection for a small decline in 
unemployment next year reflects the expira tion of the EUC program rather than an 
improvement in labor market conditions.  On ly in 2014, when real GDP is projected to 
increase more than potential, does th e jobless rate drop below 8 percent. 
The darker outlook for Europe in this  projection and the associated upward 
revision to the path of the real exchange rate have their most direct effect on the forecast 
for foreign trade.  Exports are expected to gr ow at about a 3½ percen t annual rate in the 
second half of 2012 and in 2013, about 2 perc entage points less than in our April 
projection.  In 2014, export grow th is projected to pick up to 5½ percent—again, less 
than in the April Tealbook—supported by renewed dollar depreciation and some 
recuperation in foreign activity.  Meanwhile, we anticipate imports increasing at about a 
4 percent pace over the medium te rm, held back by the sluggish U.S. recovery.  Overall, 
net trade is expected to subtract about ¼ pe rcentage point from U.S. GDP growth in the 
second half of 2012 and in 2013 and then be a bout neutral for growth  in 2014 as exports 
pick up.  Relative to the April Tealbook, this forecast is about ¼ percentage point weaker 
this year and next .

 Our projection for the business sector al so reflects the ongoing tumult in foreign 
markets.  Although firms have ample cas h on hand, many likely s ee little reason to 
expand capacity extensively in  an environment of sluggish  product demand.  Moreover, 
higher equity risk premiums and wider bond spreads suggest that uncertainty has 
increased significantly, implying that firms shoul d be more reluctant to  invest than earlier 
in the year, all else equal.  Incorporating a ll of these influences, we expect expenditures 
on equipment and software to rise at only a 5¾ percent annual rate ove r the medium term.  
Many of the same factors are holding back inve stment in structures (other than drilling 
and mining), where we foresee small declines  through next year a nd only very tepid 
growth in 2014.  Investment in drilling and mi ning is also revised down in this projection 
in response to lower oil pr ices, although the continued  deployment of horizontal drilling 
techniques should keep growth in this sector at respectable rates . 
Real PCE growth is expected to be restrained next year by the expiration of the 
payroll tax reduction and EU C benefits before rebounding in 2014.  The projection for 
growth in consumer spending this year and next is about ¼ percen tage point per year 
weaker than we wrote down in April as a result of the adverse financial market 
developments, the lower level of DPI, and the w eaker labor market in this projection.  In 
all, real PCE is expected to rise 2¼ and 3¼ percent, respectively, in 2013 and 2014, 
supported by low interest rates, strengthe ning consumer confidence, and continued 
improvements in household net worth.  With sp ending projected to ri se roughly in line 
with income, our forecast calls for the pers onal saving rate to remain near 3½ percent 
over the medium term. 
The increasingly less accommodative fiscal  policy assumed in our projection is 
expected to not only temper real PCE growth next year, but also to markedly reduce 
federal government expenditures for goods and services.  Real fe deral purchases are 
anticipated to decrease a little more than 4 percent in both 2013 and 2014, reflecting the 
effects of the Budget Cont rol Act and a further draw down of overseas military 
operations.  Our medium-term forecast for the ch ange in federal purchases is the same as 
in the April Tealbook, as the si zable downward revision to the growth in federal spending 
in the first half of this year is not anticipated to persist.  At the state and local level, real 
purchases by these governments are expected  to pick up only very slowly over the 
medium term.  This spending forecast is a litt le weaker than in th e previous Tealbook, as 
state and local tax revenues are expected to increase a bit more sluggishly with the more 
subdued economic recovery in this projection.

 Despite the downward revisions to overal l GDP growth in this projection, we 
have revised up the outlook for residential c onstruction modestly for the second half of 
this year and into 2013, as incoming data on activity and house prices  further corroborate 
that a recovery in this sector is taking hold.  That said, we c ontinue to expect the recovery 
in housing construction to be a slow one.  Historically low mo rtgage rates are expected to 
bolster home purchases and new construction over the medium term, as is the economic 
recovery more generally.  However, these pos itive influences are likely to be attenuated 
by ongoing difficulties in households’ access to  mortgage credit and by persistent 
uncertainty about job and income prospects.  In addition, we continue  to expect the flow 
of homes from foreclosure into the resale market to remain substantial, keeping the stock 
of vacant houses at a high level and thus limiting the demand for new construction.  
Accordingly, we project single-family housi ng starts to only gra dually move up over the 
forecast period to a little over 600,000 units in 2014, still less than  half of the average rate 
over the past 40 years.  
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU 
Based on the range of analyses we  use to gauge the NAIRU—including 
Beveridge curve models that track the relationship between job vacancies and 
unemployment, models that infer a path for th e NAIRU from the behavior of inflation or 
other variables the unemployment gap is though t to influence, and a variety of other 
research by Board and Reserve Bank staff— we have judged for some time that the 
NAIRU increased during the recession to about 6 percent.10  In this projection we have 
maintained that judgment and thus continue to  estimate that a considerable margin of 
slack remains in the utilization of labor resources remains in the labor market.   
In contrast, we made another downward ad justment to our estimate of potential 
output.  This adjustment was mainly intended to prevent a further deterioration in the 
alignment between our estimates of the GDP gap and the unemployment gap.  The adjustment lowered the level of potential out put 0.4 percent at the end of 2011; it also 
changed the tilt of potential ou tput over the past few years, and we carried forward some 
                                                 
10 In addition, we estimate that the emergency and extended unemployment insurance program 
boosted the “effective” NAIRU further, though we estimat e that this effect has already diminished and is 
worth only about ¼ percentage point at present.

 of the slower growth into the projection pe riod.  Consequently, we now project potential 
output to increase around 2 per cent per year in 2013 and 2014. 
Productivity and the Labor Market 
Given the available data on hours worked and our estimate of real GDP growth, 
we now judge that labor productivity in th e nonfarm business sector rose at an annual 
pace of less than 1 percent in the first half of  this year.  In our estimation, the level of 
productivity nonetheless remains a little above its structural trend.  Thus, we anticipate 
increases in labor productivity over the remainde r of this year will fall short of trend but 
rise about in line with trend thereafter. 
We expect the pace of private employment  growth to rebound some from the low 
rates of April and May but to remain subdued, with private job gains averaging only 
about 115,000 per month through mid-2013—down sh arply from our April forecast.  We 
project the pace to pick up to 200,000 per month by 2014 as output growth steps up.  In the government sector, state and local employment  is expected to change little this year 
and then to rise modestly over the next two years as budget pressures ease somewhat.   In 
the end, it is the expiration of the EUC program, more than the paltry gains in 
employment, that allows the unemployment rate to drift down from 8¼ percent currently to 8 percent by the end of 2013.  Stronger re al growth in 2014 reduces the unemployment 
rate to 7¾ percent by the end of  that year, which is nevertheless about ¼ percentage point 
higher than in the Apri l Tealbook at that point.  
Resource Utilization 
In light of the weaker projection for real activity in this Tealbook, labor market 
slack is wider than in April, with the unemp loyment rate still 1¾ percentage points above 
the NAIRU at the end of 2014.  Although the re visions we made to potential GDP leave 
the output gap—at  negative 4½ perc ent—a little narrower in the current quarter, it closes 
only slightly over the course of this year and next and ends the forecast at negative 
3½ percent, ½ percentage point wider than its value in the April Tealbook. 
Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly incorporates trends in 
labor input, our concept of capacity for the i ndustrial sector focuses on the capability of 
plants to produce with the equipment that is  in place and ready to operate; it does not take 
account of the potential workforce, either insi de the industrial sector or outside of it.  
Between 2008 and 2010, factory capacity plunged about 6 percent, and, as a result,

 resource utilization in the industrial sector is  currently higher than in the broader 
economy; indeed, capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector in April was 
77.9 percent, less than 1 per centage point below its long -run average rate.  Looking 
ahead, manufacturing capacity is projected to  rise less rapidly than potential GDP over 
the next two years, in part because of the definitional differences mentioned previously; 
our projection calls for the factory operating rate  to rise to its long-run average next year 
and then to later move still highe r despite a still-sizable GDP gap. 
Prices and Compensation 
After increasing ½ percent at an annual ra te in the first quart er of 2012, prices of 
imported core goods are expected to increase  2 percent in the current quarter, pushed up 
by the lagged effect of the run-up in commodity prices that occurred in the first quarter.  
In the second half of 2012, we expect core im port prices to decrease  at a 1 percent pace—
a downward revision of 2 percentage points re lative to the April Tealbook—owing to the 
recent appreciation of the dollar and lower co mmodity prices.  For the remainder of the 
forecast period, core import pri ce inflation is expected to be about 1½ percent, in line 
with a relatively flat trajectory for commod ity prices and the assumed pace of dollar 
depreciation.  
Readings on longer-term in flation expectations have mostly edged down over the 
period since the April Tealbook was wrappe d up.  The median 5-to-10-year-ahead 
inflation expectation from the Michigan surv ey fell to 2.7 percent in  May, 0.2 percentage 
point below the April reading, and now lies near the bottom of its recent range.  TIPS-
based measures of inflation compensation for the next 5 years and the corresponding 
measure for 5 to 10 years ahead have also both moved down about ¼ percentage point.  
Readings from the second-quarter Survey of Professional Forecasters, however, were mixed, with 10-year expectations for PCE pr ice inflation unchanged, but expectations for 
the CPI were up 0.2 percentage point from the first-quarter survey.  On the whole, we 
continue to view longer-t erm inflation expectations as essentially stable. 
Given stable long-term inflation expectations and the low levels of resource 
utilization in this Tealbo ok, along with the downward revisions to commodity and oil 
prices and the higher exchange value of the dollar, we expect inflation pressures to 
remain quite subdued over the medium term.  Indeed, we nudged down our forecast for core inflation by a tenth throughout the for ecast period, leaving core PCE inflation at 
1.6 percent in the second half of 2012 and 1.6 percent in both 2013 and 2014.   The first-

 half decline in energy prices was larger and occurred more rapidly than we had expected 
in April, and on that basis we revised down our projection for headline PCE inflation to 
1.2 percent this year.  With consumer energy pr ices expected to hold roughly flat over the 
remainder of the forecast period, headline inflat ion is expected to run a little below core 
inflation in both 2013 and 2014.   
As noted earlier, measures of labor compensation have come in lower than had 
been expected at the time of our previous for ecast.  With the margin of slack in the labor 
market projected to be wider than in the April Tealbook, and with consumer price 
inflation anticipated to be lo wer, we took some signal from  these readings and reduced 
our projection for compensation growth by a bout ¼ percentage point in both 2013 and 
2014.  Thus, we project both nonfarm hourly compensation and the employment cost 
index to rise a little less than  3 percent in both 2013 and 2014.  
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff’s forecast through 2020 using the FRB/US model and 
our assumptions about long-run supply-side co nditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  
The contour of the long-term outlook de pends on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE in flation at 2 percent, consistent with 
the Committee’s statement after the Ja nuary 2012 meeting on its longer-run 
goals and monetary policy strategies.  The federal funds rate continues to be 
set according to the estimated outcome-based rule.  
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates over the 2014–17 period, but as the time 
of portfolio normalization draws nearer, this downward pressure wanes and 
thereby contributes somewhat to the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield.  
Beyond 2017, the System’s asset holdings are expected to have  little influence 
on the level of term premiums. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds decrease gradually to normal 
levels, and banks further eas e their lending standards. 
 The federal government budget deficit (m easured on a NIPA basis) narrows 
from 4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3¼ percent of GDP in 2017, while federal 
debt held by the public hovers aroun d 73 percent of GDP, contained by the

 effects of the recovery on tax receipt s and the budgetary restraint imposed by 
the Budget Control Act.  Later in the d ecade, the deficit widens and the ratio 
of federal debt to GDP begins to in crease because of fast-rising transfer 
payments, mostly for programs related to health care.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates 2 percent per year 
from 2014 to 2017.  The pace of dollar depr eciation tapers off thereafter.  The 
nominal price of crude oil remains roughly flat from 2014 to 2016 and then 
holds steady in real terms.  Foreign real GDP rises at an av erage annual rate of 
3½ percent in 2015 through 2017 and th en gradually edges down to a 
3 percent pace by late in the decade. 
 The NAIRU declines from 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 
5¼ percent at the end of 2017 as conditions  in the labor market continue to 
improve, and it remains at 5¼ percent in the long run.  Potential GDP 
increases at an average annual rate of  about 2½ percent from 2015 through the 
end of the decade.   
The economy is projected to enter 2015 with output still below its potential level, 
the unemployment rate above the assumed NAIRU, and inflation lowe r than the long-run 
objective of the Committee.  In the staff’s long-term forecast, further improvements in 
household and business confidence, dimi nishing uncertainty, and more-supportive 
financial conditions enable real GDP to rise at an average annual rate of 3½ percent in 
2015 and 2016.  With real GDP expanding at a pace faster than the growth rate of 
potential output, labor mark et conditions improve furt her; by the end of 2017, the 
unemployment rate is about 6 percent.  With the margin of slack in labor and product 
markets diminishing, consumer price inflat ion edges up gradually but is still only 
1¾ percent in 2017.  Late in the deca de, the economy settles down with an 
unemployment rate near 5¼ percent (the assumed long -run NAIRU), inflation at 
2 percent (the Committee’s objective), and a nominal federal funds rate close to 
4¼ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Financial conditions in Europe have deteriorated over the past two months, with 
market concerns focused on the health of Spanish banks and the possibility of a Greek 
exit from the euro area.  (See the box “Recent Developments in the Euro Area” for more 
details.)   The stronger financial headwinds have contributed to a worse outlook for global 
economic activity.  In additio n, a number of emerging market economies (EMEs),  
including China, appear to have l ess momentum tha n previously anticipated.  Hence, w e 
now estimate that foreign real GDP growth slowed to 2½ percent in the second quarter, 
down from nearly 3½ percent in the first and ½ percentage point lower than expected at 
the time of the April Tealbook. 
Our baseline forecast envisions financial  stresses in Europe worsening—although 
not catastrophically —through much of the rest of this year before only gradually 
improving, a s European leaders  are forced to take further and more  aggressive steps to 
avert a more serious intensification of the crisis .  Largely as  a consequence of the 
heightened financial  stress and a relatively weak U.S. economy , foreign real GDP growth 
in the second half of this year is projected to remain depressed, averaging just under 
2½ percent.  Next year, as the euro -area recession comes to an end, foreign  growth is 
expected to  edge up, and by 2014, with the recovery in the United States and Europe 
firming, growth  is expected to reach  3¼ percent , a little above its trend rate . 
Our projection for foreign growth has been revised down from that in the April 
Tealbook by about ½ percentage point.  Not only is the outlook gloomier, but it is also unusually uncertain.  A financial meltdown triggered by a Greek exit from the euro area or revelations of greater problems among Spanish banks represent a significant downside risk; so, too, does a hard landing in China, although its effects would likely be less 
disruptive.  Both of these scenarios are discussed in the Risks and Uncertainty section  in 
this Tealbook. 
Since the time of the April Tealbook, only a few countries, including China and 
Brazil, have loosen ed monetary policy, but we expect that the subdued economic outlook 
will lead to additional easing in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and the EMEs in 
coming quarters and to a greater degree than envisioned at the time of the April 
Tealbook.  Quiescent inflation in many economies should also  support the decision to

 Recent Developments  in the Euro Area 
Financial stresses in  the euro area have  deepened  considerably  since the time of 
the April Tealbook.   Sovereign  spreads have widened  further in Spain and Italy to 
levels last seen in late 2011 (as  shown in  lower‐ left figure on the next page).  Euro‐
area bank  stock prices have fallen sharply,  and bank CDS spreads have risen. 
 
Fears about a possible Greek exit from the euro area increased  following  the 
May 6 Greek parliamentary  elections,  which revealed  strong political backlash  
against Greece’s  EU–IMF program.   The voters  rewarded  anti‐program parties, 
and the resulting  political landscape became  highly fragmented.   The newly  
elected representatives were  unable to form  a majority  government,  and a weak 
interim caretaker  government  was installed  with new  elections  to be held on 
June 17.  It remains unclear whether  the June elections  will produce  a 
government  that can agree  with the EU and the IMF on a way forward for 
Greece’s program.  Continued  political impasse could jeopardize  the flow of 
official financing  to Greece,  both to the  Greek government  from the EU and IMF 
and to Greek  banks from Eurosystem  liquidity support operations.   Ultimately  
this political deadlock  could lead to severe  financial instability  and, possibly, 
Greece’s exit from the euro area,  a development  that could trigger turmoil  
throughout  the region.  Timely data are not available,  but there have  been 
reports that withdrawals  of Greek bank deposits  surged in the weeks following  
the May 6 election.  
 The deterioration in  market sentiment  toward Spain  reflects mounting  concerns  
about its public finances and the cost of stabilizing  its banks (see the box 
“Developments  in  the Spanish Banking  System” in  the Financial  Developments  
section in  this Tealbook).   Those concerns  have been heightened  by further 
slippage in the fiscal performance of  regional governments  and by muddled  
communications  from Spanish public officials.  In  addition,  the recession  is 
deepening  and consumer  confidence  has plummeted  in recent months (see 
lower‐ right figure  on the next page), suggesting  that domestic consumption  and 
output will decline  further in the near term.  The economic  weakness threatens  
to compound  Spain’s banking and fiscal difficulties, potentially  undermining  the 
government’s  efforts to fund further interventions  in the banking system. 
 In light of market pressures,  the Spanish government  announced  on June 9 that 
it intends to ask for European  financial assistance  for its banking system.  In 
response,  European  authorities  indicated  they would provide sufficient  
assistance to cover  all capital requirements  of Spanish banks, as  estimated  by 
currently  ongoing external audits, plus an additional  safety margin, and 
estimated  the total required amount  would be up to €100 billion.   Markets  failed 
to respond  positively  to the announcement,  however,  as the proposal  lacked 
details and, because the assistance  will be a contingent  liability of the Spanish 
government,  did little to reassure  investors regarding  the sustainability  of Spain’s 
sovereign  debt.

 More generally,  as euro‐area financial  stresses have intensified,  markets and 
policymakers  have focused on the risks of bank failures and deposit runs, not 
only in Greece and  Spain, but elsewhere  in Europe as well.  Although  the euro‐
area rescue package  for Spain  sets a useful precedent of  targeted  banking‐sector 
assistance,  this approach would  not address either  a regional  run on deposits  or 
the long‐run fiscal  burdens faced by individual  countries  in recapitalizing  their 
banks.  Germany  has signaled a new willingness  to consider  ambitious  policy 
options for broader burden‐sharing  among euro‐area  governments, but only  as 
part of a wider integration  initiative that  also includes more centralization  of 
fiscal and financial supervision.   At their next summit on June 28–29, 2012, 
European  leaders are  to discuss  a European Commission  proposal  for a European  
“banking  union” that would include a single EU  deposit guarantee  scheme 
covering all EU banks as well as a common EU  resolution  authority,  resolution  
fund, and financial supervisor  for systemic and  cross‐border banks.  Such a 
banking union could partially relieve some European  governments  of the fiscal 
burden of  stabilizing  their banks.  However,  even if political consensus  on this 
proposal were reached,  implementation  of such a banking  union would likely 
require years of time‐consuming  negotiations  over details,  legislation  by national 
parliaments  of all participating  countries, and  amendments  of the EU treaty.  
 
Finally, European  leaders have been discussing  strategies  for governments  to 
support near ‐term growth even as they attempt to reduce  fiscal deficits.  At their  
May 23 summit, European  leaders affirmed  an earlier  agreement  that the 
European  Investment  Bank (EIB) would allocate €230 million to guarantee  
privately issued bonds to finance  infrastructure  projects.   In addition,  leaders 
discussed  a possible  increase in  the capital of the EIB, which would enable it  to 
finance more projects across the  EU.  Although  these  efforts may provide some 
stimulus to growth  if concentrated  in the smaller peripheral  countries  (Greece,  
Ireland, and Portugal),  they are unlikely to materially  affect growth prospects  for 
Spain, Italy, or the euro area more  broadly.

  ease policies further .  We estimate that foreign prices rose 2 ¼ percent at an annual rate in 
the second quarter and project that inflation will stay  around that rate through the forecast 
period.  Th is projection is a little  lower than in the April Tealbook, reflecting the weaker 
outlook for global demand  and lower commodity prices, particularly for oil. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
We anticipate that the financial crisis and recession in Europe will hold down real 
GDP growth in  the AFEs to only 1 percent in 2012, with growth edging up to 2 percent 
by 2014 as the crisis gradually abates and the euro area begins to recover .  All told, the 
output gap in the AFEs widens for the next year and a half before narrowing a bit in 
2014.  Relative to the April Tealbook, we have revised down our projection of AFE growth an average of about ½ percentage point over the forecast period .  These revisions 
are largest  in the euro area, where , as a result of a deeper recession and slower recovery,  
growth is expected to average  about 1 percentage point less than previous ly anticipated ; 
the forecast for the other major AFE s is down roughly ¼ percentage point.  T he weaker 
forecast  for the U.S. economy also has contributed to the downward revision to the AFE 
outlook. 
Our forecast  for inflation  in the AFEs is down slightly this year and next 
compared to the April Tealbook, in line with our project ions for weaker economic growth 
and a lower path of oil prices .  With inflation contain ed—aggregate AFE inflation is 
expected to remain at or below 1½ percent through 2014—and weaker economic activity, 
we envision more  accommodative monetary policy across the AFEs than assumed in the 
April Tealbook.  In particular, w e expect the Bank of Canada to push back its first policy 
rate hike, and we foresee greater  asset purchases by the Bank of Japan  and the Bank of 
England.  We also now expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut its policy rate and to provide more liquidity support to banks.  
Euro Area 
In putting together our outlook for the euro area, we struggled to consider the 
effects of developments that are hard to predict but which have critical implications for our forecast.  Most obviously, Greek elections (scheduled for June 17) may  fail to deliver 
a government that will agree with other euro-area authorities and the IMF on a way to sustain Greece’s official financing .  Such a failure could potentially lead to Greece’s exit 
from the euro area and —with European policymakers currently unprepared to manage 
the consequences—severe contagion to other peripheral European economies and global

  financial markets more generally.  Alternatively, even without a Greek exit, concerns 
over the safety of banks in Greece, Spain, and elsewhere could lead to deposit runs that 
would destabilize domestic financial systems, exacerbate the fiscal burdens on 
governments, and again destabilize  international markets .  Notably, the euro- area rescue 
package for Spanish banks announced over the weekend has done little to boost investor confidence in that country’s financial and fiscal position.  (See the box “Developments in the Spanish Banking S ystem ” in the Financial Developments section in  this Tealbook.) 
In the end, we decided that, although the risk of such adverse developments has 
become more pronounced, the most likely outcome is not a Lehman Brothers–style global meltdown.  Greece’s situation will be extremely difficult regardless of who wins the election, but polls show the Greek people overwhelmingly prefe r to stick with the 
euro.  Our sense is that negotiations between Greece and its official creditors will likely 
drag on for a number of months.  Even were these negotiations to ultimately break down, the Greek government w ould likely employ  a variety of means —for example, bank 
holidays, capital controls, and running arrears—to put off switching to a new currency.  These actions could delay a Greek exit, giving markets and policymakers more time to 
prepare for  such an event.  By the same token, our baseline forecast does not assume a 
widespread run on deposits in euro-area banks.  R etail depositors have stopped short of 
an outright run even in Greece, with its acute banking difficulties and nontrivial risk of abandoning the euro.  For Spain and Italy, where stresses are not nearly so severe, we assume that most depositors will count on actions of the official sector to protect them —
such as official -sector support for banks and sovereigns, the ECB’s ample liquidity 
provision to banks, and progress on plans for an EU-wide deposit insurance scheme—and  
will avoid destabilizing bank runs. 
All that being said, even if Europe avoids the most dire outcomes, the ongoing 
difficulties in the region, combined with the deepening recession and the mounting realization by markets that current policy responses have been inadequate, strongly suggest that the crisis will become more pronounced in the coming months.  Our working 
assumption is that financial conditions will continue to deteriorate un til the European 
authorities have no choice but to adopt additional measures to turn the situation around.  
Our best guess is that such measures will be relatively limited in scope —providing new 
euro area–IMF programs to vulnerable governments or further e asing the terms of 
Eurosystem liquidity support to banks—and will lead to only slow improvement in financial and economic conditions thereafter, say, by next year .  However, we cannot

  preclude the possibility that European policymakers could be pushed to more aggressive 
and sweeping solutions, such as the EU deposit insurance scheme and the bank resolution 
fund currently being discussed, which could lead to a more rapid recovery.  
Against this backdrop, we now forecast a more severe and prolonged economic 
contraction  in the euro area than in the April Tealbook.  In the first quarter, real GDP was 
flat, pulled down by a fourth consecutive quarter of contracting domestic demand.  
Preliminary indicators for the second quarter point to a decline in overall economic activi ty, with the composite PMI and business confidence falling in May to their lowest 
levels in more than two years.  In addition, industrial production fell further in April, led 
by sharp declines in German y, Italy,  and Spain .  Indicators for consumption also  remain 
weak, with consumer confidence depressed and retail sales down sharply in April.  The euro-area unemployment rate held steady at 11 percent in April, its highest level since the 
launch of the common currency. 
We now expect real GDP to fall at a 1¼ percent rate this quarter and about 
1½ percent in the second half of this year.  Eventually, as policymakers take additional actions to prevent a catastrophic event, we expect financial conditions to gradually 
improve and the economy to begin to slowly rec over in the second half of 2013.  With 
fiscal austerity and continued tight credit conditions, we anticipate that  real GDP growth 
will pick up only modest ly to a  1½ percent pace by the end of 2014. 
We estimate that euro -area inflation moderated from 2½ percent in the first  
quarter to slightly less than 2 percent in the second , as energy prices decelerated.  With 
the output gap widening, we expect inflation to moderate further to 1½ percent in the second half of 2012 and to remain at or below that rate through 2014. 
At its June meeting, the ECB left its bench mark policy rate unchanged at 
1 percent and announced an extension through the end of the year of its provision of unlimited liquidity through sho rt-term refinancing operations.  In light of the weaker 
outlook, we now expect the ECB to reduce its policy rate 25 basis points in the second half of the year and substantially expand its liquidity support to banks, including by offering longer- term refin ancing operations, which will push the overnight interest rate 
even closer to zero in coming months.

  United Kingdom 
Real GDP contracted 1¼  percent in the first quarter, the same as  in the fourth, 
partly owing to a drawdown of inventories.  However, employment edged up and the 
composite PMI remained consistent with positive economic growth.  Going forward, the intensification of the crisis in the euro area has led us to cut our forecast for average  
U.K. GDP growth  in the last three quarters of 2012 to 1 percent .  With weaker global 
growth expected  and further fiscal consolidation planned, we project  U.K. growth to pick 
up only gradually , to 1½ percent in 2013 and 2½ percent in 2014, both down almost 
½ percentage point from  the projection in the April Tealbook. 
A planned tuition hike should lift quarterly inflation from around 1½ percent in 
the second and third quarter s to nearly  3½ percent in the fourth.  We project i nflation will 
then subside to about 1½ percent in 2013 and 2014.  This path is a touch lower than in the April Tealbook due to a wider output gap and lower commodity prices.  With subdued inflation and ample spare capacity, we now expect the Bank of England to expand its quantitative easing program later this year by £75 billion , to £400 billion (26 percent of 
GDP) .  In the April Tealbook, we had assumed a £50 billion expansion.  
Japan 
Real GDP grew 4¾ percent in the first quarter, 2 percentage points more than 
estimated in the April Tealbook, boosted by temporary factors, including the 
reconnection of supply chains with Thailand, a subsidy for the purchase of fuel- efficient 
cars, and a step -up in post-earthquake reconstruction activity.  However, r ecent data 
suggest that activity has decelerated —industrial production rose only slightly in April, 
and the May manufacturing PMI points to only moderate expansion.  Accordingly, we 
estimate  real GDP growth declined to 2¼ percent in the current quarter , in line with the 
April Tealbook.  T he recent appreciation of the yen, the expiration of stimu lus measures, 
and weak external demand  should slow GDP growth further to  an average pace of just 
below 1 percent in the second half of this year .  Thereafter, as the global recovery gains 
momentum, output growth should gradually pick up to 1½ percent by the end of the forecast period.  Relative to the April Tealbook, growth is down ¾ percentage point in the second half of 2012 and about ¼ percentage point over the remainder of the forecast period.  
Consumer prices rose at an annual pace of 2¼ percent in the first quarter, boosted 
by increases in food and energy prices.  However, we expect a return to mild deflation

  through the remainder of this year and next.  The near- term path of prices has been 
marked down, reflect ing the recent drop in commodity prices and the appreciation of the 
yen.  Amid sizable output gaps and persistent deflation, we anticipate that the Bank of 
Japan  will moderately  expand  its asset purchase program.  We also  now assume that the 
Noda administ ration will win parliamentary appr oval for a doubling of the consumption 
tax to 10 percent ; an initial 3 percentage point hike is expected in April 2014.  The tax 
increase is a first  step toward fiscal consolidation, with the fiscal deficit expected to 
decline only gradually from nearly 10 percent of GDP this year.  
Canada 
First-quarter GDP grew at about a 2 percent  pace, a little less than expected , with 
a negative contribution from net exports partly offsetting a strong boost from investment 
spending.  R ecent indicators generally have been  positive; employment r ose at a solid 
pace on average in April  and May, and the manufacturing PMI rose for the fourth straight 
month in May.  Thus, we expect GDP growth to remain around 2 percent in the current quarter , in line with the April Tealbook.  Ho wever , given the downward revision to the 
U.S. and global growth outlook, we lowered the Canadian growth  forecast for the 
remainder of the forecast period about ¼ percentage point.  W e now expect Canadian 
GDP  to expand 2 percent in 2012 and 2013 and 2½ per cent in 2014.  
Driven mainly by the lower path for oil prices , we expect inflation to moderate to 
about 1½ percent in the second half of 2012 before edging up to 2 percent in 2014.  
Relative to the April Tealbook, this forecast is down about ¼ percentage point over the 
remainder of 2012 and little changed thereafter.   Given the prospective slower progress in 
closing the output gap and only modest inflation pressures, we now expect the Bank of Canada to delay the first increase of its policy rate until the second quarter of 2014, one 
quarter later than anticipated in the April Tealbook. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
A nearly complete set of first -quarter GDP releases confirm s that  the EMEs  
rebounded from the floods in Thailand, with  economic growth ri sing to an annual rate of 
5½ percen t, from 2¾  percent in the fourth  quarter .  However, the overall tone of more 
recent economic data from the emerging market world —including PMIs, industrial 
production, and exports—has been decidedly weaker than expected , reflecting in part 
sluggish growth in the advanced economies and f inancial spillovers from the turmoil in 
Europe.  Accordingly, we estimate EME growth retreated to just over 4 percent this

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  quarter  and will remain there during the second half of this year.  Compared with the 
April Tealbook, our forecast for the current quarter is about ¾ percentage point lower and 
for the second half almost ½ percentage point lower. 
Growth in the EMEs should strengthen a bit over the forecast period, reaching  
about 4½ percent by  2014, as the advanced economies recover somewhat  and as some 
EME policymakers take measures to support activity.  However, our projection in 2013 and 2014 is about ¼ percentage point lower than in the April Tealbook, reflecting the substantially slo wer pace of recovery envisioned in Europe and the United States as well 
as reduced incomes for commodity exporters .  Moreover, there are significant downside 
risks related to a further deterioration of the crisis in Europe and, although less likely, a sharp slowdown of the Chinese economy. 
With weaker growth, we estimate headline inflation in the EMEs remained at a 
modest annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter.  Inflation is expected to dip slightly in the second half of this year and then edge up to about 3¼ percent in 2014.  Subdued inflation will provide some scope for additional monetary policy accommodation.  Most EME central banks have kept policy rates unchanged since the April  Tealbook , but 
central banks in Brazil  and China eased monetary policy , and we expect additional easing 
in these two countries as well as in India.  We have also pushed back monetary tightening in some other countries, including Colombia, Indonesia, and Thailand.  A flight to quality 
and falling commodity prices induced sharp currency depreciations in a number of EMEs.  The downward pressure on their currencies led authorities in Brazil, India, and Mexico, among others, to intervene to support their currencies. 
China  
In China, data for April and May indicate that growth r emained restrained in the 
second quarter, at least by historical Chinese standards.  Industrial production was below 
its March level, and retail sales and investment growth also slowed.  Accordingly, we 
revised down our estimate of Chinese real GDP growth in the current quarter 1 percentage point to 7½ percent.  We have also lowered the forecast for economic growth over the remainder of the forecast period  by ¼  percentage point, to about 
8 percent, reflecting our take that the weaker outlook for the advanced economies and, to 
a lesser extent, weaker domestic momentum  will not be entirely offset by recent and 
future  Chinese policy responses.

  In early June, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cut  the one-year lending and 
deposit rates 25 basis points, to 6.31 percent and 3.25 percent, respectively , the first 
change in these rates since they were raised in July 2011.  In addition, the PBOC reduced 
banks’ required reserve ratios 50 basis points in May—the third such reduction since 
authorities began to loosen monetary policy last November —bringing the ratio for large 
banks to 20 percent.  Authorities have also announced new fiscal stimulus measures 
focus ed on infrastructure investment and energy efficiency, such as rebat es for efficient 
appliances and  automobiles.  The current package of stimulus measures is considerably 
smaller than the one introduced in 2008 following the global financial crisis.  Our baseline calls for additional monetary and fiscal a ccommodation. 
Inflation has continued to edge lower and was 3  percent on a 12-month basis in 
May, providing more leeway for authorities to focus policies on supporting growth.  O ur 
baseline forecast for China still calls  for stable and relatively solid economic growth, with 
authorities being able to use expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to cope with moderate negative shocks to the economy. 
However, the risk of a Chinese hard landing , as described in the alternative 
scenarios  in the Risks and Uncertainty section, has increased since the previous 
Tealbook.  The property market is one source of risk, given a sharp run-up in property prices from 2009 through early 2011 driven by a surge in credit.  A uthorities could falter 
on the delicate line of trying to lead property prices gradually lower without causing investment to plummet.  A collapse of the property market would exacerbate problems in the banking sector, which is burdened by loans for infrastructure projects —related to the 
2008 fiscal stimulus package—many of which are likely to be unprofitable.  These projects  also led to a large increase in local government debt, which may inhibit local 
authorities’ ability  to initiate new projects  to spur growth.  Another source of risk is that a 
collapse in external demand similar to the one in late 2008 could drag  Chinese economic 
growt h down along with that in the rest of the world.  In the end, however, authorities are 
likely to do whatever possible to avoid a sharp slowing, especially  during the once-a-
decade political transition  scheduled for the end of this ye ar, when a new  president and 
premier  will be selected .  But  if the shocks to the economy are sufficiently large, 
authorities might only be able to cushion rather than avert a hard landing.

  Other Emerging Asia 
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, real GDP growth reb ounded to an annual pace of 
5¾ percent in the first quarter after being flat in the fourth,  as supply chains disrupted by 
flooding were largely restored.  But this increase is ¾  percentage point lower than our 
April Tealbook forecast, as activity in India, Hong Kong, and Taiwan surprised on the 
downside.  Second-quarter indicators, including weak export growth, also disappointed, 
and we now estimate that output growth in the region slowed more in the current quarter 
than previously anticipated, to about 4 percent.  Going forward, we expect growth in these economies to edge up to 4½ percent by  2014.  This projection is about 
¼ percentage point below our April Tealbook forecast, primarily reflecting the more pessimistic outlook for the advanced economies. 
Inflation in the region is estimated to have in creased to an annual rate of 
4½ percent in the current quarter, largely driven by a spike in Indian inflation; upward consumer price pressures in India partly reflect pass -through from the sharp depreciation 
of the Indian rupee.  We expect inflation in the region to moderate to  3¼ percent  next 
quarter  and stay  at about that level over the remaind er of the forecast period.  
Latin America 
In Mexico, real GDP  grew at an annual rate of 5¼  percent in the first quarter, up 
from a pace of 3 percent in the fourth quarter.  The step- up in Mexican activity was led 
by growth in industrial output—mirroring a spike in U.S. manufacturing production—and agricultural output also rebounded.  Based on the path of U.S. manufacturing output, we estimate that Mexican GDP growth moderated back to a 3 percent  pace in the current 
quarter and will stay around that rate over the remainder of the forecast period. 
We estimate South American  GDP growth slowed from an annual rate of 
3¾ percent in the first quarter  to 3 percent during the current quarter, and we project that 
it will edge back up to 3¾  percent by the end of 2014.  We revised down our outlook for 
the region by more than ¼ percentage point, owing to the weaker outlook for the advanced economies and the lower path of commodity prices.  In Brazil, where performance has lagged the rest of the continent, real GDP registered an increase of only  
¾ percent  at an annual rate in the first quarter —the fourth consecutive quarter of growth 
below 2 percent .  Economic activity in Brazil has been depressed owing in part to 
previous monetary policy tightening and the fall in commodity prices.  However, Brazilian growth should gradually firm over the forecast period, to reach about 4 percent

  in 2014, supported by now -accommodative monetary and fiscal policies as well as the 
recovery of economic activity in the advanced economies.  
In Mexico, headline inflation plummeted in the second quarter, owing to waning 
food price inflation  and electricity  subsidies.  We see inflation settling at about 
3½ percent over the remainder of the forecast period, below the upper bound of the 
central bank’s target range.   In Brazil, with economic growth having stalled recently , we 
estimate inflation moderated to less than 4 percent in the second quarter .  The central 
bank has cut the Selic rate by a cumulative 4  percentage points since August, including 
the most recent 50 basis  point cut  that occurred in late May , to 8½ percent .  We project 
that Brazilian inflation will move bac k up a bit  next year  as the economy recovers .

Financial Developments 
Investors pulled back from risk-tak ing over the intermeeting period amid 
mounting concerns about the euro area a nd evidence of slowing economic growth at 
home and abroad.  Subsequently, the dete rioration in sentiment was tempered by 
expectations of further policy accommodation by  central banks as well as anticipation of 
measures by European authorities to mitigate the banking crisis in Spain.  However, last 
weekend’s announcement that euro-area authorities woul d provide funds to support 
Spanish banks has failed to spur further improvement in market sentiment.  
  On net over the intermeeti ng period, the expected path for the federal funds rate 
shifted down in 2014 and beyond.  Yields on lo ng-dated nominal Treasury securities fell 
notably over the period, consistent with the revision in the policy path, increased  
safe-haven demands, and increased odds  market participants put on further 
accommodative balance sheet actions by the Federal Reserve.  TIPS-based measures of 
inflation compensation edged down as commodi ty prices declined.  Broad indexes of 
U.S. equity prices posted losses, spreads on investment- and specu lative-grade corporate 
bonds relative to comparable-maturity Treasur y securities increase d, and option-implied 
measures of volatility of equity prices and longer-dated Treasury yields rose.   
Stock prices declined even more sharply in  most major foreign financial markets.  
However, measures of stre ss in funding markets for European financial institutions 
showed little sign of deteriorat ion, likely owing in part to the earlier provision of ample 
liquidity by the European Central Bank (E CB) through its longer-term refinancing 
operations.  Yield spreads of peripheral Eur opean sovereign debt to German bonds rose, 
and the U.S. dollar appreciated against the euro  and most other currencies.  Reflecting the 
overall pullback from risk and the weaker economic outlook, yields on U.K. and German 
bonds fell notably. 
In the United States, recent trends in financing flows remained mostly in place.  
Bond issuance was robust for investment-g rade corporations, and commercial and 
industrial (C&I) loans grew at a solid pace; in contrast, high-yield bond issuance slowed.  
In the household sector, nonrevolving consum er credit expanded briskly, while the 
growth of revolving credit remained subdued.  Mo rtgage refinancing activity edged up as

  interest rates declined, though the increas e continued to be damped by capacity 
constraints and tight le nding conditions.    
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Rising concerns about the European  fiscal crisis and generally  
weaker-than-expected domes tic and global economic data  pushed yields on Treasury 
securities and agency MBS substantially lo wer over the intermeeting period.  The weak 
tone in economic data releases, particularly  the May employment report, contributed to a 
notable downward revision in the expected pa th of policy and prompted considerable 
speculation about the potential for further bala nce sheet actions by the Federal Reserve.  
Concerns about the situation in Europe reportedly also prompted strong safe-haven 
demands for Treasury securities.    
The expected path of the federal funds rate derived from overnight index swap 
(OIS) rates rotated down, with the rate an ticipated at the end of 2015 lower by about  
30 basis points.  The expected federal funds ra te now first rises above the current target 
range in the first quarter of 2014, one quarter later than at the time of the April FOMC 
meeting.  The modal path—the most likely valu es for future federal funds rates based on 
implied risk-neutral distributions estimated from interest rate caps—remained within the 
current target range through late 2015.1 
Results from the Open Market Desk’s latest survey of primary dealers also 
showed a notable decline in medium-term policy expectations.  In particular, the 
distribution of the most likely tim e of the first rate increase shifted to the right, with the 
median date moving from the third quarter of  2014 to the fourth quarter.  In addition, 
dealers revised up the probability from 20 percen t to 40 percent that, within the next year, 
the FOMC will seek to further increase th e average duration of the SOMA portfolio, 
while keeping the probability that the FO MC will announce additional asset purchases 
roughly unchanged at 50 percent.  The combin ed probability that one or both programs 
will be announced within the next year stood at 70 percent, while the odds that such 
programs will be announced at the June meeti ng was only slightly lower at 50 percent.  
Dealers also revised up the probability that the FOMC will change its federal funds rate 
guidance within the next year from 30 per cent to 50 percent, but  only saw a 15 percent 
chance that such an action will be  announced at the June meeting.  
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 16 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 3 basis points.

  The Treasury yield curve flattened cons iderably over the intermeeting period. 
While 2-year yields were roughly unchanged, 10-year and 30-year yi elds declined by as 
much as 60 basis points to 1.44 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively (t heir lowest levels 
on record), on June 1 before finishing the pe riod about 35 basis points lower on net.  The 
staff’s term structure models attribute about half of the decline in longer-term Treasury 
yields over the period to lo wer real term premiums, presumably reflecting elevated 
investor demand for the safety and liqui dity of Treasury securities amid the 
intensification of the European crisis as well as increased investor expectations for 
additional Federal Reserve balance sheet actions. 
Additional factors contributi ng to the decline in 10-year nominal Treasury yields 
include lower inflation expectations and re duced inflation risk premiums.  Likely 
reflecting sharp declines in commodity pr ices, TIPS-based inflation compensation over 
the next five years fell 6 ba sis points, on net, and swaps- and caps-based measures posted 
even larger declines.  In addition, the probability of deflation over the next five years 
derived from inflation caps edged up, although it remained within its recent range.  The 
TIPS-based and swaps-based five-year forwar d measures of inflation compensation fell 
10 basis points, on balance, while the caps-based measure was little changed. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Heightened financial strains within the euro area and weak macroeconomic data 
weighed on foreign financial markets during the intermeeting period.  Yields on most 
euro-area peripheral sovereign debt rose as investor sentiment worsened notably after Greek elections failed to produce a new government.  News that Spain had partly nationalized the troubled lender Bankia and would need to in ject an additional €19 billion 
into the bank and its holding company added to concerns about th e region, leading to 
plans for an official aid package of up to €100 billion to recapitalize Spanish banks.  (See 
the box “Developments in the Spanish Banking System.”)  Data showing that private-sector deposits in Spanish banks fell 1.9 percen t in April likely added to the pressures, 
and a reported sharpening of deposit outflows from Greek banks reinforced concerns that 
Greece may be on its way out of the euro area.   Banking woes were widespread:  Rating 
agencies downgraded major banks in Germa ny, Italy, Spain, and several other European 
countries; euro-area bank stoc ks fell sharply; and credit spreads of European banks 
widened.  However, indicators of funding ma rket stresses remained muted, as many 
banks accessed funds from the ECB rather th an interbank markets.  Euro LIBOR–OIS

Developments  in  the  Spanish  Banking  System  
Concerns   about  the  vulnerability   of  the  Spanish  banking  system  and  the  sustainability   of  Spain’s  
sovereign  debt  increased   significantly   during  the  intermeeting   period.   In  response,   euro‐area  
policymakers   reached  an  agreement  in  principle  on  June  9  that  European  financial  stability  
funds  would  provide  loans,  possibly  totaling  as  much  as  €100  billion,  for  use  in  recapitalizing  
Spanish  banks.   Although  markets  rallied  in  anticipation   of  the  agreement,   initial   market  
reaction  to  the  announcement   itself  was  generally    negative:    European  bank  stock  price  
indexes  fell  a  bit,  and  yields  on  Spain’s  sovereign  debt  rose.   Many  commentators   noted  that  
important  details  remain  to  be  worked  out.   Moreover,  because  drawings  on  the  assistance  
package  will  increase  the  debt  of  the  Spanish  government,   concerns   about  the  effect  of  
supporting   the  banks  on  Spain’s  fiscal  sustainability   remain  unaddressed.   
Spanish  banks  had  accumulated   substantial   exposures   to  real  estate  during  Spain’s  property  
boom.   Such  exposures   were  particularly   large   at  savings  banks  (cajas),  most  of  which  were  
controlled   by  regional  or  local  governments   or  other  nonprofit   entities.   The  subsequent   bust,   
with  real  estate  prices  having   dropped   about  30  percent  from  their   2007  peak,  has  pushed  
nonperforming   loan  (NPL)  balances  up  to  about  8  percent  to  total  loans  as  of  March  of  this  
year,  led  by  NPLs  on  land  development  and  construction   loans  (over  20  percent  of  such   loans  
are  nonperforming).    The  potential   for  more  loans  of  all  types  to  become  nonperforming   is  
large  and  increasing:    Spain’s  unemployment   rate  has  risen  to  about  24  percent,   its  second  
recession  of  the  past  three  years  is  deepening,  and  real  estate  prices  continue  to  fall.   Concerns   
about  solvency  have  put  pressure  on  the  liquidity   of  Spanish  banks,  with  deposits  from  nonbank  
euro‐area  residents  down  about  4  percent  during  the  six  months  ending  in  April  2012,  replaced  
in  part  by  funds  from  the  ECB.   Withdrawals   by  nervous  depositors   likely   account  for  some  of  
the  decline,  although  a  portion  probably   represents   a  natural  response  to  the  lower  cost  of  ECB  
funding  and  to  regulatory   changes.    
To  be  sure,  the  Spanish  authorities   have  taken  fairly  aggressive  actions  in  response  to  the  real  
estate  bust  to  support  and  strengthen  the  banking  system.   Since  2009,  all  savings  banks  have  
been  convert ed  into  commercial   banks  and  many  have  been  merged  or  acquired,  sometimes   
with  assistance  from  the  deposit  insurance  fund  or  the  government’s   vehicle  for  conducting   
bank  recapitalizations   (the  Fund  for  Orderly  Bank  Restructuring,  or  FROB).    Regulatory   policies  
in  place  prior  to  2009  required  Spanish  banks  to  hold  relatively  large  loan  loss  reserves  and  high‐
quality  capital,  and  government  decrees  in  February  2011  and  February  and  May  2012  required  
further  increases   in  loan  loss  reserves  and  capital  buffers,  with  the  threat  of  government  
takeover  or  other  actions  in  the  case  of  banks  unable  to  meet  the  requirements.   The  most  
prominent  recent  case  is  Bankia,  which  has  requested  €19  billion  (about  2  percent  of  GDP)  of  
government  assistance  to  enable  it  to  meet  the  new  loan  loss  reserve  and  capital  requirements.    
Even  so,  markets  have  become  very  concerned  that  losses  on  loans  will  grow  so  large  and  the  
scale  of  needed  recapitalization  will  become  so  great  that  the  Spanish  government  will  be  
unable  to  provide  it.   The  amount  of  capital  needed  to  cover  losses  is  highly  uncertain.   Analysts’  
estimates  of  credit  losses  to  be  charged  off  over  the  next  couple  of  years  vary  according  to  the

severity  of  the  scenario  they  envision,  but  many  estimates   cluster  in  the  neighborhood   of  
€230  billion,  or  more  than  20  percent  of  GDP.   Our  own  estimates   of  Spanish   banks’   credit  losses  
in  a  severe  stress  scenario  are  similar.   Such  estimates   are  consistent   with   loan  loss  rates  that  
are  somewhat  higher  than  those  experienced   by  the  Nordic  nations  in  their  banking  crisis  of  the  
early  1990s,  although  smaller  than  those  in  Ireland  more  recently.   However,  with  existing  loan  
loss  reserves  likely   to  absorb   much  of  such  losses,  estimates   of  the  amount  needed  for  bank  
capital  injections   are  smaller:   At  €37  billion,  a  recent  IMF  estimate  is  toward   the  low  end  of  a  
wide  range  of  values,  while  most  other  estimates   do  not  exceed  €100  billion  (about  10  percent  
of  GDP).1   The  Spanish  government  had  maintained   that  additional   amounts  of  government   
assistance  needed  by  banks  would  be  smaller  than  €40  billion.   In  response  to  widespread  
skepticism   by  investors,  the  authorities   engaged  external  auditors  to  provide  estimates   of  
Spanish  banks’  recapitalization   needs,  with  initial  numbers  due  by  June  21  and  more‐detailed  
estimates   due  by  the  end  of  July.    
The  size  of  the  banks’  recapitalization   needs  is  of  particular   concern  to  markets  because  the  
burden  is  believed  to  have  the  potential   to  undermine   the  solvency  of  the  Spanish  government.   
Although  the  country’s   debt‐to‐GDP  ratio  is  projected   to  be  only  80  percent  at  the  end  of  2012  
(not  counting  any  loans  from  euro‐area  financial  stability  facilities),   below  the  euro‐area  
average,  Spain’s  ability  to  pursue  budget‐ cutting  measures   to  reduce  its  large  fiscal  deficits  is  
uncertain   (see  the  box  “Recent  Developments   in  the  Euro  Area”  in  the  International   Economic   
Developments   and  Outlook  section  in  this  Tealbook).    Accordingly,   yields  on  Spanish  sovereign  
debt  have  become  quite  sensitive  to  news  about  potential   needs  to  issue  additional   debt,  either  
to  cover  fiscal  deficits  or  the  costs  of  bank  recapitalization.    For  example,   news  of  Bankia’s  need  
for  additional   capital  drove  up  Spanish  sovereign  debt  yields  considerably.    Bankia’s  request  for  
€19  billion  exceeded   market  expectations,   which  were  between   €7  billion  and  €15  billion,  and  
highlighted   the  potential   for  further  adverse  surprises   regarding   the  capital  needs  of  Spanish  
banks.   Additionally,   markets  may  have  been  concerned   that  the  Spanish  government   would  be  
unable  to  issue  €19  billion  in  bonds  under  current  market  conditions.        
The  European  assistance  package  announced    by  euro‐area  finance  ministers   on  June  9  
represents   an  attempt  to  rebuild  confidence   in  Spanish  banks.   The  assistance   will  enable  the  
FROB  to  obtain  loans  from  Europe’s  financial  stability  facilities  to  fund  injections   into  banks  as  
needed.   However,   it  is  not  clear  how  much  will  be  drawn  from  the  facilities,  what  subset  of  
banks  will  receive  assistance,   what  conditions   will  be  imposed  on  the  Spanish  banking  system,  
and  whether  the  loans  will  be  senior  to  existing  Spanish  sovereign  debt.   Moreover,   because  
repayment   of  any  such  assistance   must  be  backed  by  the  Spanish  government,   the  assistance   
will  increase  Spain’s  consolidated   sovereign   debt.   Thus,  the  package  may  fail  to  induce  a  
sustained   improvement   in  confidence   in  Spain’s  banks  and  fiscal  sustainability.    In  the  days  
leading  up  to  the  June  9  announcement,   markets  rallied  on  expectations   of  a  financial  
assistance   package.    Since  then,  stock  prices  and  credit  default  swap  spreads  of  the  six  largest  
Spanish  banks  have  been  little  changed,   though  spreads  on  Spanish  sovereign   debt  have  risen.  
1 Estimates vary not only because of differences in estimated credit losses, but also because of differing 
assumptions about preprovision net income over the next few years and about drawdowns of existing buffers 
of capital above regulatory minimums to absorb losses.

  spreads and implied basis spreads from eur o–dollar swaps are little changed at shorter 
maturities.  Moreover, the amount of dollar swaps outstanding with the ECB declined on 
balance.  
The negative news from Europe had a clea r effect on global financial markets.  
Equity prices declined worldwide, partic ularly in Japan and many emerging market 
economies (EMEs), although they staged a modest  rally late in the period on expectations 
that Spain would receive aid in recapitalizing its banks.  Flight-to-safety flows helped 
push U.K. and German 10-year sovereign yi elds down more than 50 basis points to 
record lows before they partially retr aced as sentiment improved in June.   
The staff’s broad nominal dollar index ended the intermeeting period up about 
3 percent.  On net, the dollar appreciated against most currencies except the yen, which 
rose over 2 percent against th e dollar.  The dollar ended th e period up nearly 5½ percent 
against the euro and reached multiyear highs against both the Brazilian real and the 
Indian rupee, sparking interventions by aut horities in Brazil and India to support their 
currencies.  Flight-to-safety flows also re portedly led to sizable interventions by the 
Swiss National Bank in order to maintain its ceiling of 1.2 euros per Swiss franc. 
Signs of a slowdown in global growth adde d to downdrafts in financial markets 
and prompted easing by some central banks.  Brazil’s central bank cut rates to a  record-low rate of 8.5 percent.  Responding to weak April data, the People’s Bank of 
China cut benchmark lending and deposit rates 25 basis points and reduced bank reserve requirement ratios 50 basis points.  In cont rast, the ECB and the Bank of England held 
their main policy rates steady and left  their liquidity programs unchanged. 
Foreign official inflows into U.S. securi ties slowed in April and May from the 
robust pace earlier in the y ear, as appreciation of the dollar against EME currencies 
during those months reduced purchases of do llars by EME authorities.  Private foreign 
investors purchased U.S. Treasury securities, on net, in April while selling U.S. corporate 
bonds and reducing net purchases of U.S. equ ities to about zero.  U.S. investors’ net 
purchases of foreign securities were also about zero in April.     
SHORT -TERM DOLLAR FUNDING MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  
There was no visible evidence of new significant strains in short-term dollar 
funding markets over the intermeeting peri od.  The three-month LIBOR–OIS spread

  edged lower, and the spread between the ra tes implied by the three-month forward rate 
agreement and the OIS rate three to six m onths ahead—a forward-looking measure of 
potential funding pressures—was about uncha nged on net.  In addition, the three-month 
euro–dollar basis swap spread, which reflects th e cost of shifting euros into dollars over 
the near term, was up only sligh tly.  All of these spreads remained well below peak levels 
reached in late 2011, as the ECB’s long-term refinancing operations provided significant 
liquidity, especially to Spanish and Italian ba nks.  In addition, in recent quarters, some 
European institutions have reduced their holdings of dollar-denominated assets, reduced 
exposures to certain business lines that rely heavily on dol lar financing, and reportedly 
turned to secured funding for their illiquid le gacy assets.  Reflecting these developments, 
the amount of dollar swaps outstanding with  the ECB declined over the intermeeting 
period and is well below its peak earlier this year. 
Outstanding unsecured financial commerc ial paper (CP) from issuers with 
European parents moved down to its lowest level since the turn of the year, mostly 
reflecting decreases at institutions with parents domiciled in France and the United Kingdom.  In addition, the fraction of issuance of unsecured financial CP with very short 
maturities (one to four days) for institu tions with parents in France and the United 
Kingdom remained noticeably above that for institutions with parents in the United 
States.  The exposures of U.S. money market  funds to Europe edged down 3 percent in 
May but still totaled $790 billion, including $360 billion in euro-z one holdings.  Net 
flows to prime money market funds showed little evidence of heightened concern about 
Europe in recent weeks.    
In secured funding markets, Treasury ge neral collateral repo rates continued to 
edge higher than the level observed around th e turn of the year .  Sales through the 
Federal Reserve’s maturity extension program  and somewhat heavier-than-anticipated 
bill issuance by the Treasury Department ma y have led to elevated primary dealer 
holdings of shorter-dated Treasury securities.  (See the box “Recent Upward Pressure on Overnight Money Market Rates. ”)  In asset-backed commer cial paper (ABCP) markets, 
amounts outstanding have remained stable fo r programs with U.S. sponsors but have 
decreased a bit for programs with European sponsors.  Overnight spreads on ABCP are 
about unchanged on net.

 Recent Upward Pressure  on Overnight  Money  Market Rates  
As shown in  the top figure on the next page, the May 2012 averages  for overnight  
federal funds,  Treasury  general collateral  (GC) repo, and Eurodollar  rates were 
7 to 11 basis points higher than their respective  average values in September  of 
last year.  A variety of factors can move  money market rates, and  over the period 
since the target range  for the federal funds  rate has been 0 to ¼  percent,  these 
rates have at times been near  the bottom and at the  top of this range.  Recently,  
elevated credit default swaps and other measures  of perceived  riskiness  of 
securities  dealers, for example,  could result in higher funding costs for these 
entities, resulting  in higher money market rates overall.   Market participants  have 
suggested  that the firming in money market rates over the  past several months  
likely reflects, at least in part, the increase in  short‐dated Treasury  securities  held 
by the public over that  time.  As shown in  the middle figure on the next page, net 
issuance of  short‐dated  Treasury  securities  increased  over this  period with only  a 
slight pause after  tax season (the red bars).  At the same  time, Federal Reserve  
sales of Treasury  securities  with remaining  maturities  of 3 months to 3 years 
under the maturity  extension  program  (MEP) led  to an even larger increase in  the 
amount of publicly held short‐dated Treasury  securities  (the yellow bars).  
In addition to the overall increase in short‐ dated securities  held by the public, 
upward pressure  on money market rates could stem from securities  dealers’ 
financing  of their inventori es.  As shown in  the bottom figure on the next page, 
the increase in  publicly held short‐dated  securities  has been accompanied  by an 
increase in  primary dealers’ net Treasury  securities  inventories, which have  risen 
to an average  of about $100 billion in May, compared  with an aver age level of  
about $20 billion in September  2011.  It is noteworthy  that this increase has been 
concentrated  in Treasury  securities  maturing  in 3 years or less.  Because  primary 
dealers tend to finance  their inventories  largely in the repo market, the resulting  
increased  demand for funding  may have put upward  pressure  on the Treasury  GC 
repo rate.1  Consistent  with  this view, staff  regression analysis  suggests  that 
increases  in dealers’ inventories  of securities  are associated  with increases  in the 
Treasury GC repo rate.2  Moreover,  this analysis also  suggests  that increases  in 
repo rates are linked to increases  in a broader set  of money market rates. 
 
                                                 
1 Market commentary  suggests that even with the rise in the Treasury GC repo rate over 
the period of the MEP,  dealers  are making profits on their holdings of shorter‐dated Treasury 
securities,  consistent  with the relatively  high bid‐to‐cover ratios on the MEP  sales operations.   
2 Other empirical  work  shows that the increase in net Treasury issuance may  have also 
contributed  to the recent increase in the Treasury GC repo rate; see Eric LeSueur  and Lisa 
Stowe (2012) “What Accounts  for the Recent Upward Pressure in Repo?”  Federal  Reserve

  were little changed over the past three months (see appendix).  However, some dealers 
reported a decline in the use of leverage acr oss various transaction types by hedge funds 
over the same period.  More recently, market participants have reported reduced liquidity 
in some markets, including those for cor porate bonds and loans, as dealers reduce 
inventory amid the overall pullback from risk.   
Over the intermeeting period, equity prices  for large domestic banks, particularly 
those with substantial invest ment banking operations, significantly underperformed broad 
stock market indexes on concerns about Eu rope and the domestic economy.  Bank shares 
also declined broadly after the announcement of trading losses at JPMorgan Chase, in 
part because of increased invest or concerns about the quality of risk management at other 
banks with substantial trading operations, as well as potential regulatory fallout from the 
event.  Share prices of some large banks fell more than 15 percent, and CDS spreads 
widened on net.   
Securities prices may have been influen ced by concerns about the possible size of 
the downgrades by Moody’s Investors Service of  the credit ratings of  five of the six 
largest U.S. banks that are anticipated by th e end of June.  The downgrades (expected to 
be from one to three notches) could limit th e affected banks’ access to short-term funding 
or pose other liquidity difficulties.2  Downgrades could also make it more difficult for 
borrowers to issue instrument s (such as ABCP and variable-rate demand obligations) that 
depend on liquidity support from banks.3  Perhaps in anticipation of these downgrades, 
responses from the June SCOO S indicate that dealers in creased their attention on 
concentrated exposures  to other dealers. 
                                                 
2 The domestic institutions on watch for downgrade have relatively little reliance on unsecured 
short-term funding, and although they do rely significantly on repo, the bulk of their repo is secured by 
Treasury and agency collateral, which should mitigate,  in part, liquidity concerns.  Downgrades to  
long-term ratings could trigger additional liquidity demands stemming from requirements to post additional collateral or make termination payments under derivatives contracts or trading agreements, but the institutions report that they anticipate these amounts would be relatively small.  It is less clear to what 
extent downgraded institutions might see clients or counterparties pull balances or move business away, 
have difficulty rolling over longer-term debt, or have to  put instruments for which they provide liquidity 
support onto their own balance sheets.  Notably, how ever, all of the largest U.S. BHCs now maintain 
reserves of cash and liquid securities on the order of 20  percent of their assets, providing a sizable cushion. 
3 In addition, money market funds may no longer wish or be allowed to hold variable-rate demand 
obligations (VRDOs) with liquidity support from do wngraded banks, resulting in the municipalities that 
issued the VRDOs needing to find alternative liquidity backstops or potentially face accelerated 
amortization of the loan balance on the VRDOs.

  OTHER DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad U.S. equity price indexes fell , on net, over the intermeeting period, 
consistent with the widespread retreat from risky assets across global financial markets.  
As stock prices and yields on Treasury secu rities dropped, the staff’s estimate of the 
spread between the expected real equity re turn for the S&P 500 index and the real  
10-year Treasury yield—a gauge of the equity premium—ramped up close to its 
historical high in early 2009.  Option-implie d volatility on the S&P 500 index also rose, 
though it remained below the leve ls seen in late 2011, and the share of downside risk for 
the S&P 500 implied by option prices reached a very high level. 
Although aggregate operating earnings per share (EPS) for firms in the S&P 500 
index in the first quarter of 2012 increased at a 6 percent quart erly rate, most of the gain 
was attributed to financial firms, and profits for the firms in the nonfinancial sector were 
about flat.  Looking forward, Wa ll Street analysts still expe ct aggregate EPS for S&P 500 
firms to grow at a healthy rate over the coming year, though forecasts of year-ahead 
earnings were revised down a t ouch over the intermeeting period. 
Yields on investment-grade corporat e bonds fell slightly, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, reaching historically low levels, while yields on speculative-grade 
corporate bonds rose sligh tly, although they, too, remained quite low by historical 
standards.  However, spreads on both invest ment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds 
widened considerably, although they remain a bit below their previous peaks observed 
last fall.  The spreads of yields on A2/P2 -rated unsecured CP i ssued by nonfinancial 
firms over yields on highly rated nonfinancial issues were little changed, on balance, over 
the intermeeting period. 
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Nonfinancial firms continued to raise f unds at a solid pace in April and May.  
Although earnings-related blackout peri ods limited bond issuance in April,  
investment-grade bond issuance made a strong comeb ack in May as issuers took 
advantage of low yields; speculative-grade is suance stepped down in May and has since 
slowed to a trickle.  While some issuance proceeds were used to  finance mergers and 
acquisitions, much of the new bond issuance continued to be used to refinance existing 
debt.  Both C&I loans and nonfinancial CP outstanding increased, on net, over April and 
May.

  Secondary-market prices for syndicated leveraged loans declined, particularly for 
more liquid, widely traded names.  However,  issuance of new syndicated loans appears to 
have remained solid in April and May desp ite some reports of tightening terms for 
issuers.  Continued growth of collateralized loan obligations contributed to the strength in 
the market. 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinanci al firms continued apace in April and 
then shot up in May with the completion of the Facebook IPO.  However, IPOs have 
since dried up, as a handful of deals were postponed afte r the poor performance of the 
IPO for Facebook, whose share price plummeted in the days following the offering.  In 
the first quarter, share repur chases and cash-financed mergers by nonfinancial firms 
remained robust, leaving net equity issuance deeply negative.  However, fewer mergers and new share repurchase programs were annou nced in the second qua rter, indicating that 
equity retirements will likely slow, possibly reflecting increased concerns about the domestic economy and Europe. 
Available indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to 
be quite solid.  The aggregate ratio of debt to assets is estimated to have been stable at a 
relatively low level in the first quarter.  The liquid asset ratio fell some but remained near 
its highest level in more than 20 years.  In April and May, the pace at which Moody’s 
upgraded nonfinancial corporate bonds exceed ed that of downgrades.  The six-month 
trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial fi rms remained low in April and May, and the 
C&I loan delinquency rate fell ag ain in the first quarter.  Th e expected year-ahead default 
rate for nonfinancial firms from the Moody’s KMV model was unchanged in May. 
Financial conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector remained strained 
amid weak fundamentals and tight underwriting conditions.  Prices for CRE properties 
continued to fluctuate at low levels, as vacan cy and delinquency rates remained elevated.  
Spreads on commercial mortga ge CDSs widened somewhat over the intermeeting period, 
reflecting the broader pullback from risky as sets.  Nonetheless, CMBS issuance during 
April and May has outpaced such issuance during the first quar ter.  Moreover, 
commitments by banks to fund commercial construction have increased in recent 
quarters.

  HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Credit conditions in residen tial mortgage markets remained tight despite a further 
decline in mortgage rates to historically low levels.  The drop in mortgage rates, while 
significant, was outpaced by th e decline in yields on Treasury and mortgage-backed 
securities.  The resulting increase in spr eads likely reflects capacity constraints at 
mortgage originators.  Refinancing activity rose  in April and May but is still substantially 
limited by tight lending standard s and low levels of home eq uity.  Mortgage refinancing 
through HARP has also ticked up in recent m onths, suggesting that recent program 
enhancements have helped alleviate some of  the constraints hinderi ng the refinancing of 
underwater mortgages.  
House prices ticked up further in March a nd April and are now about 1 percentage 
point above their year-earlier  level.  However, 23.7 percen t of mortgages continue to 
have negative equity.  Although the rate  at which mortgages are entering into 
delinquency has declined, the fraction of exis ting mortgages that are seriously delinquent 
remains elevated relative to historical standards.   
Overall consumer credit grew at a so lid pace in recent months.  Nonrevolving 
credit expanded notably in April, mainly be cause of continued growth in student loans, 
which are now almost entirely originated by th e federal government.  However, revolving 
credit was mostly unchanged, in part because nonprime borrowers continued to face tight underwriting standards for credit cards.  Deli nquency rates for consumer credit remained 
low, especially for revolving credit, like ly reflecting a compositional shift toward 
borrowers with higher credit scores.  The rate of issuance of consumer ABS picked up in the second quarter, owing to particularly st rong issuance of auto loan ABS in April and 
student loan ABS in May.  
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Since the April FOMC meeting, the Treasury has auctioned $267 billion in 
nominal securities and $13 billion in 10-year  TIPS.  The auctions were generally well 
received, with bid-to-cover ratios slightly  above—and indirect bidding ratios close to—
their recent averages.  Market participants were reportedly surprised by the Treasury’s announcement to postpone its decision about the introduction of a floating-rate note 
program, as such a program had been expected to be introduced in the May quarterly 
refunding statement; however, the announcement had a limited effect on asset prices.

  Gross long-term issuance of municipal bonds picked up in April and May, with 
net bond issuance turning positive for the first time since the beginning of 2011, 
indicating that municipalities  may, in aggregate, be retu rning to capital markets.  
However, ratings downgrades of municipal bonds by Moody’s continued to substantially 
outpace upgrades in the first quarter, and incomi ng data suggest that this trend will likely 
continue in the second quarter.  CDS spread s for states moved higher, on net, over the 
intermeeting period, and spreads on long-term  general obligation municipal bonds rose. 
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit continued to expand in Apr il and May.  Banks’ securities holdings 
rose further, though at a more moderate pace than earlier in the year.  Core loans—the 
sum of C&I loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans—also increased modestly.  Robust growth of C&I loans at domestic banks  and U.S. branches and agencies of  
non-European banks was only partially offset by a broad decline in such loans at U.S. 
branches and agencies of European banks.  CRE loans continued, on balance, to contract 
over the two-month period.  Consumer loans rose modestly in April and May, as did 
closed-end residential mortgages.  Home equity loans declined further.  Noncore loans, in 
contrast, increased briskly, on average, impor tantly reflecting loans to nonbank financial 
institutions. 
According to the May Survey of Term s of Business Lending, spreads on C&I 
loans over banks’ cost of funds continued to trend down since February but remained 
elevated.  Changes in some nonprice terms, such as loan maturity, also suggested a 
modest further easing of lending conditions.  However, the average spread on C&I loans 
with original amounts less than $1 million (a proxy for loans to small businesses) 
changed little and remained quite high, even on loans with the stronge st risk ratings.   
Call Report data indicated that aggregate pr ofitability of BHCs in the first quarter 
remained below pre-crisis levels and, excluding debt valuation adjustments and litigation 
provisions, was little changed from the previous quarter.  Net interest margins, which 
have been pressured by the low interest rate environment, continued to remain near their 
historical lows.  Amid ongoing improvement in asset quality for most loan categories, the 
ratio of loan loss reserves to net charge-offs has increased st eadily over the past two years 
and, while still a bit low, has reached a value t ypical for this point in the economic cycle.  
Overall, regulatory capital ratios improved fu rther, supported by retained earnings and 
reductions in risk-weighted assets, especially at the largest banks.

  The growth rate of the M2 monetary a ggregate slowed somewhat in April and 
May compared with the first quarter of 2012.  However, the level of M2 and its largest 
component, liquid deposits, remains elevated re lative to what would be expected based 
on historical relationships with nominal inco me and opportunity costs.  This elevated 
level likely reflects investors’  continued desire to hold sa fe and liquid assets amid 
increasing concerns about developments in Europe.  At least some of the demand for M2 
balances probably reflects the temporar y unlimited insurance on noninterest-bearing 
deposits under the Dodd–Frank Act.5   
Currency grew in line with historical averages in April and May, while retail 
money market fund balances and small time deposits continued to decline.  In spite of the 
growth in currency, the moneta ry base contracted at a 9½ percent average annual rate 
over the two months, as the expansion in currency was offset by a drop in reserve 
balances, driven in part by the decrease in foreign central bank liquidity swaps in early 
April (see the box “Balance Sheet Devel opments over the Intermeeting Period”).6  
 
                                                 
5 The Dodd–Frank Act provides temporary, unlimited deposit insurance coverage for  
noninterest-bearing transaction accounts in excess of $250,000 from December 31, 2010, through 
December 31, 2012. These deposits are estimated to have grown nearly 50 percent from December 31, 
2010, and currently make up about 15 percent of M2. 
6 The growth rates of reserves and the monetary base are calculated on a monthly average basis for 
April and May, while the box discusses net changes over the intermeeting period.

 Balance Sheet Developments  over the Intermeeting  Period 
Since the April FOMC  meeting,  the Open Market Desk  conducted  32 operations  
as part of the maturity extension  program  (MEP):  The Desk purchased  about 
$63 billion in Treasury securities  with remaining  maturities  of 6 to 30 years and 
sold $71 billion in Treasury  securities  with maturities  of 3 months  to 3 years.1  
MEP‐related operations  are expected  to be completed  by the end of June 2012.  
In addition,  the Desk purchased  $42 billion in agency MBS securities  as part of the 
policy of reinvesting  principal  payments  from agency debt and agency MBS.2   
Foreign central  bank liquidity swaps decreased $9  billion to $23 billion, with a 
continuation  of the decline in draws by the European  Central Bank and the Bank 
of Japan.  The net portfolio  holdings  of Maiden Lane  III LLC declined  $2 billion, 
reflecting  the settlement of  roughly half of the asset sales completed  during the 
period.  The payment date for the remainder  of the asset sales is June 14, 2012.  
Loans outstanding  under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities  Loan  Facility fell 
slightly.     
On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet,  other deposits  
decreased  $73 billion, reflecting  a decline  in balances  of government ‐sponsored  
enterprises  (GSEs) after the monthly  payment of  principal  and interest on agency 
MBS in May.  The U.S. Treasury’s General  Account decreased $64  billion, largely 
reflecting  the drawdown  of April tax  receipts.   Balances  flowing out of GSE and 
Treasury accounts  boosted reserve balances  in the banking system; reserve 
balances of depository  institutions  increased  $100 billi on over the period.   Federal

Appendix 
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Surve y on Dealer Financing Terms  
Responses to the June 2012 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing 
Terms indicated little change, on balance, in cr edit terms applicable to important classes of 
counterparties over the past three months.  View ed in conjunction with similar responses to the 
March survey, the results suggest that these terms have been generally stable since the beginning 
of the year.1  However, about one-half of firms, on net, reported an increase in the amount of 
resources and attention devoted to the management of concentrated exposures to dealers and 
other financial intermediaries, a nd about two-thirds of respondents noted such an increase with 
respect to central counterparties and other financ ial utilities.  Several respondents cited strains in 
Europe as a factor in explaining the increased focus on exposures both to dealers and other 
financial intermediaries and to central counter parties and other financial utilities.  About  
one-fourth of respondents indicated that the use of financial leverage by hedge funds had decreased somewhat during the past three months.  The use of financial leverage by trading real 
estate investment trusts (REITs), mutual funds, exchange-traded funds ( ETFs), pension funds and 
endowments, and insurance compan ies remained basically unchanged.
2  Notable net fractions of 
dealers reported that the provision of differential terms to most-favored hedge funds and trading 
REITs had increased over the past three months.     
As in the March survey, respondents indicated that nonprice terms incorporated in new or 
renegotiated over-the-counter (OTC ) derivatives master agreements were broadly unchanged 
during the past three months.  Dealers also reported that initial margin requirements, which fall outside the scope of the master agreements, were  little changed over the same period.  However, 
almost one-fifth of respondents indicated that th e posting of nonstandard collateral (that is, other 
than cash and U.S. Treasury securities) permitte d under relevant agreements had increased 
somewhat. 
With regard to securities financing, survey respondents indicated that the credit terms 
applicable to the securities types included in the survey were generally little changed, on balance, over the past three months.  Modest net fractions of dealers noted that the demand for funding of 
high-grade and high-yield corporate bonds as well as non-agency residential mortgage-backed 
                                                 
1 The June survey collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three months in 
credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.  In 
addition to the core set of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about derivatives prime 
brokerage, a second set of special questions focused on  bilateral repurchase agreements, and a final set of 
special questions regarding the appetite of institutional investors for credit and duration risk.  The 22 institutions participating in the survey account for almost all of the dealer financing of  dollar-denominated securities for nondealers and are th e most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives 
markets.  The survey was conducted during the period from May 22, 2012, to June 4, 2012.  The core 
questions ask about changes between March 2012 and May 2012.

  securities (RMBS) had increased over the past three months.  Dealers reported a much more 
pronounced increase in demand for funding of  agency RMBS with almost one-half of 
respondents pointing to an increase.  Modest net fractions of respondents also reported an increase in demand for term funding with a maturity  greater than 30 days for both agency and 
non-agency RMBS.  In contrast to the improveme nt reported in the March survey, responses to 
the June survey suggested that liquidity and f unctioning in the underlying asset markets for most 
collateral types covered by the survey had rema ined basically unchanged over the past three 
months. 
In response to special questions on deriva tives prime brokerage, about one-third of 
survey respondents indicated that the fraction of new client OTC derivatives trades cleared 
through derivatives prime brokerage arrange ments had increased over the past year.
3  
Nonetheless, most respondents indicated that at present the fraction of new client OTC derivatives trades cleared through derivatives pr ime brokerage arrangements was 10 percent or 
less.  With regard to clients using derivatives prime brokerage arrangements, about one-third of respondents indicated that the fraction of client s with such agreements in place had increased 
somewhat over the past year.  However, nearly four-fifths of dealers noted that at present less 
than 10 percent of clients had such agreements in place. 
A second set of special questions asked about bilateral repurchase agreements (repos).  A 
majority of respondents reported that the volume of  financing that is provided to clients through 
bilateral repo agreements for almost all types of  collateral considered in the survey was little  
changed over the past year.  Of note, however, a bout one-third of respondents, on net, indicated 
an increase in the volume of such funding provided for non-agency RMBS, and one-fifth pointed to an increase in funding for agency RMBS and U.S. Treasury collateral.  The fraction of bilateral repo funding currently provided to clients, rather th an to other dealers or financial intermediaries, 
varied significantly across firms. 
A final set of special questions queried dealers about changes in the appetite of 
institutional investors for credit risk and duration ri sk over the past year.  With respect to credit 
risk, nearly one-fifth of dealers, on net, indicated  an increase in appetite to take on such risk on 
the part of mutual funds, pension plans, endowments, and insurance companies.  With respect to duration risk, about one-fourth and one-fifth of dealers, on net, pointed to increased appetite to 
take on such risk on the part of insuran ce companies and pension funds, respectively. 
                                                 
3 “Derivatives prime brokerage” refers to arrangements where a hedge fund or another client 
negotiates derivatives trades with multiple dealers that  are subsequently “given up” for clearance to one (or 
more) dealers.  As a result, the client faces a smalle r number of dealers as its OTC derivatives counterparty 
but retains the flexibility to trade with the entire population of dealers.  These arrangements may allow 
more-efficient use of collateral, for example, becau se a dealer offering derivatives prime brokerage 
computes requirements based on portfolio risk measures that recognize risk-reduction benefits from 
offsetting trades as well as offeri ng certain operational advantages.

  COUNTERPARTY TYPES  
Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries  
In the June survey, about one-half of respondents indicated that the amount of resources 
and attention devoted to management of con centrated credit exposure to dealers and other 
financial intermediaries had increased over the p ast three months.  In the March survey, about 
one-third of respondents, on net, had reported such an increase.  This pattern of responses may 
suggest some recent resurgence of concerns about  the condition of financial institutions after 
these concerns had apparently somewhat eased earlier in the year.  Of note, all but one of the nine 
“broad-scope” dealers, which are active across a range of products and markets, indicated that the 
amount of resources and attention devoted to d ealers and other financial intermediaries had 
remained basically unchanged, and that smaller d ealers were disproportionately likely to report an 
increase.   
Central Counterparties and Other Financial Utilities 
About two-thirds of dealers indicated that the amount of resources and attention devoted 
to management of concentrated exposures to cen tral counterparties and other financial utilities 
had increased over the past three months.  This fraction is somewhat higher than that in the 
previous survey but similar to that in the D ecember survey.  Of note, seven of the nine  
broad-scope dealers indicated that the amount of  resources and attention devoted to management 
of this concentrated credit exposure had increased. 
Hedge Funds 
As in March, the responses to the June su rvey indicated that price and nonprice terms 
applicable to hedge funds across the spectrum  of securities financing and OTC derivatives 
transactions were little changed over the past three months.  Only a small number of dealers 
reported having changed somewhat price terms (such as financing rates) or nonprice terms 
(including haircuts, maximum maturity, covenant s, cure periods, cross-default provisions, or 
other documentation features) offered to hedge funds, with some dealers reporting a tightening 
and others reporting an easing of credit terms.  The few institutions that reported an easing of credit terms most frequently pointed to more-a ggressive competition from other institutions, and 
the most important reason cited by the few respondents that reported a tightening was a worsening in general market liquidity and functioning.  Only about one-fourth of dealers, a significantly smaller fraction than in the March survey, noted an increase in the intensity of efforts by hedge funds to negotiate more-favorab le price and nonprice terms over the past three 
months.  Despite credit terms that were said to be  little changed, about one-fourth of respondents 
—a slightly larger fraction than in March—suggest ed that the use of financial leverage by hedge 
funds had decreased somewhat over the past three m onths.  A vast majority of dealers noted that 
the availability of additional fina ncial leverage under agreements currently in place with hedge 
funds had remained basically unchanged.  About one -fifth of respondents, on net, indicated that 
the provision of differential terms to most-favor ed hedge funds had increased somewhat over the 
past three months.

  Trading Real Estate Investment Trusts 
Although a large majority of respondents reported that price and nonprice terms offered 
to trading REITs had remained basically uncha nged over the past three months, a modest net 
fraction of dealers noted a tightening of price terms offered to these counterparties.  One-third of 
respondents reported that the intensity of efforts by trading REITs to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms had increased over the same period, and about one-fourth of dealers indicated an increase in the provision of differentia l terms to most-favored clients of this type.  
Finally, the reported use of financial leverage  by trading REITs remained basically unchanged. 
Mutual Funds, Exchange-Traded Funds, Pension Plans, and Endowments 
As in March, the responses to the June surv ey suggested that, on balance, there had been 
little change in the price and nonprice terms offe red to mutual funds, ETFs, pension plans, and 
endowments during the past three months.  Of note, about one-fourth of respondents stated that the intensity of efforts by clients in this cat egory to negotiate more-favorable credit terms had 
increased somewhat over the same period.  Both  the provision of differential terms to  
most-favored mutual funds, ETFs, pension plans, and endowments as well as the use of financial 
leverage by clients of this t ype remained basically unchanged. 
Insurance Companies 
Dealers reported in the June survey, as they had in March, that price and nonprice terms 
applicable to insurance compani es had remained basically unchanged over the past three months 
despite an apparent continued increase in the inte nsity of efforts by such clients to negotiate 
more-favorable credit terms.  The use of financial le verage by clients of this type also remained 
basically unchanged. 
Separately Managed Accounts Estab lished with Investment Advisers 
Nearly all dealers indicated that nonprice terms negotiated by investment advisers on 
behalf of separately managed accounts were basi cally unchanged over the past three months.  A 
few respondents suggested that the price terms had eased, with the most important reason cited for such changes being more-aggressive competition from other institutions.  The reported intensity of efforts by such clients to negotia te more-favorable credit terms and the use of 
financial leverage were little changed. 
Nonfinancial Corporations 
Survey respondents reported that, on balance, price and nonprice terms offered to 
nonfinancial corporations had remained basically unchanged, on net, over the past three months.  
About one-fifth of respondents, however, indicated that the intensity of efforts by nonfinancial 
corporations to negotiate more-favorable terms had increased somewhat.

  Mark and Collateral Disputes 
Most respondents indicated that the volume,  persistence, and duration of mark and 
collateral disputes with each counterparty type incl uded in the survey were little changed over the 
past three months. 
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES  
As in the March survey, dealers reported th at nonprice terms incorporated in new or 
renegotiated OTC derivatives master agreements were broadly unchanged over the past three 
months.4  A few respondents, on net, indicated that they had tightened requirements, timelines, 
and thresholds for posting additional margin, and a few noted that they had eased with respect to 
other documentation features, such as cure pe riods and cross-default provisions as well as 
acceptable collateral requirements.  Nearly all survey respondents noted that initial margins 
(which fall outside the scope of master agreem ents) on contracts referencing most underlying 
collateral types were basically unchanged over th e past three months.  About one-fifth of 
respondents, on net, indicated that the posting of  nonstandard collateral (that is, other than cash 
and U.S. Treasury securities) permitted under releva nt agreements had increased somewhat.  For 
most contract types included in the survey, almost all dealers reported that the volume, duration, 
and persistence of mark and collateral disputes re mained basically unchanged over the past three 
months.  However, a few respondents, on net, indicated that the volume of disputes with regard to 
contracts referencing FX and equities had decreased. 
SECURITIES FINANCING  
Respondents indicated that credit terms under which most types of securities included in 
the survey are financed were little changed, on balance, over the past three months.   
Almost one-half of dealers reported an incr ease in demand for funding of agency RMBS 
over the past three months, and almost one-third of respondents noted greater demand for term 
funding of this collateral type—that is, funding with a maturity of 30 days or greater.  In addition, 
nearly one-fifth of dealers, on net, noted that overall demand for funding had increased for 
high-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, and that both overall demand and demand for term 
funding had increased for non-agency RMBS over the same period.   
In contrast to the March survey, which pointed to an improvement in liquidity and 
functioning in the underlying markets in which th e various specified collateral types are traded, 
dealers reported in June that conditions in these markets had remained basically unchanged.5  As 
                                                 
4 The survey asks specifically  about requirements for postin g additional margin, acceptable 
collateral, recognition of portfolio or diversifica tion benefits, triggers and covenants, and other 
documentation features, including cure periods and cross-default provisions. 
5 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repos and similar secured financing transactions, 
not changes in the funding market itself.  This questio n is not asked with respect to equity markets in the 
core questions.

  in the March survey, nearly all respondents reporte d that the volume, duration, and persistence of 
mark and collateral disputes were basica lly unchanged for all collateral types. 
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON DERIVATIVES PRIME BROKERAGE  
Derivatives prime brokerage arrangements ha ve been cited as potentially reducing the 
total notional value of outstanding OTC derivatives transactions, including those types that would 
likely not be centrally cleared in the foreseeable future, with consequent benefits that include 
efficiencies in collateral manageme nt and reduction of operational risks.6  A special question 
asked about changes over the past year in th e fraction of new client OTC derivatives trades 
cleared through derivatives prime brokerage a rrangements.  About one-third of survey 
respondents indicated that the fraction of such trades cleared through derivatives prime brokerage 
arrangements had increased over the past year, and the remainder suggested that the fraction had 
remained basically unchanged.  A vast majority of respondents reported that at present the 
fraction of new client trades cleared through de rivatives prime brokerage arrangements was about 
10 percent or less.  The remaining special ques tions on derivatives prime brokerage focused on 
the number of clients with derivatives prime br okerage arrangements in place rather than the 
volume of trades cleared through such arrangements.  About one-third of respondents indicated that the fraction of such clients had increased ove r the past year, and the remainder of dealers 
reported that the fraction had remained basically unchanged.  About three-fourths of dealers indicated that at present the fraction of clients using derivatives prime brokerage agreements was 
about 10 percent or less. 
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON BILATERAL REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS  
Repos that are settled bilaterally (and not through the triparty mechanism involving a 
clearing bank) reportedly represent an important share of the secured funding provided by dealers to hedge funds and similar types of clients.  The first special question asked about changes over 
the past year in the volume of financing provided through bilateral repos for a number of collateral types.  About two-thirds of dealers i ndicated that the volume of bilateral repo funding 
they provided over this horizon had remained  basically unchanged for high-grade corporate 
bonds, high-yield corporate bonds, commercial mort gage-backed securities, and sovereigns other 
than U.S. Treasury securities.  For agency RM BS, non-agency RMBS, municipal securities, and 
U.S. Treasury securities, net fractions ranging be tween 20 and 35 percent reported an increase.  
When asked about the fraction of bilateral repo f unding currently provided to clients rather than 
to other dealers and financial intermediaries, r esponses varied widely.  About 20 percent of 
respondents indicated that the fraction was below 20 percent, about 60 percent of dealers 
                                                 
6 Derivatives prime brokerage arrangements can significantly reduce the number of outstanding 
OTC contracts insofar as the client, typically a hedge fu nd, effectively is left, after the novation of trades, 
facing only the dealer functioning as its derivatives prime broker.  The derivatives prime broker, in turn, 
faces all of the other dealers with whom the client en tered trades.  However, because the derivatives prime 
broker typically has many trades in place with other d ealers, there are significan t opportunities to compress 
these down to a single net exposure.  Several service pr oviders now offer dealers tool s to aid in the efficient 
compression of OTC derivatives exposures, including those stemming from serving as a derivatives prime 
broker.

  indicated that the fraction was between 20 and 80 percent, and 20 percent of respondents placed it 
between 80 and 96 percent.   
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON APPETITE OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS FOR CREDIT 
AND DURATION RISK 
The current environment of very low interest rates has reportedly posed particular 
challenges to investors who, because of their investment mandates or liability structure, 
effectively have nominal return targets.  Some  commentators have suggested that these investors 
might respond, at least in part, by taking on additional credit risk (for example, by purchasing 
securities that entail greater expected default ri sk) or duration risk (for example, by purchasing 
securities with greater duration).  The last set of special questions queried dealers about the 
appetite of institutional investors to take on cred it and duration risk over the past year.  Nearly 
one-fifth of dealers, on net, reported an increase in appetite to assume credit risk on the part of all specified types of clients—that is, mutual f unds, pension plans, endowments, and insurance 
companies.  With respect to duration risk, about one-fourth and one-fifth of dealers, on net, pointed to increased appetite to take on such risk  on the part of insurance companies and pension 
plans, respectively.  Respondents, by contrast, not ed little change in appetite on the part of other 
specified types of institutional investors.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY  
We continue to see the uncertainty ar ound our projection for economic activity as 
elevated relative to the average experience of  the past 20 years (the benchmark used by 
the FOMC).  In part, this assessment reflects the aftereffects of the U.S. financial crisis 
and the unusual depth and persis tence of the recession, which have created considerable 
uncertainty about the resilience of the financial system, the magnitude of slack in labor 
and product markets, and the pace at which the recovery is likely to proceed.  Beyond 
these factors, however, we see heightened risk s associated with the deterioration in the 
European fiscal and financial situation.  The staff’s baseline forecast envisions financial 
stress in Europe becoming noticeably worse th rough much of this year before gradually 
improving, as European policymakers eventua lly take additional steps to contain the 
crisis in Europe.  Of course, euro-area policymakers could m ove more quickly to resolve 
the crisis than we expect.  However, we see a greater risk that Eur opean financial stress 
could intensify by more than  projected, resulting in a much more severe economic 
downturn in Europe than in the baseline, w ith notable disruptions to global financial 
markets, including our own.  As illustrated by the European crisis scenario discussed 
shortly, such an outcome would have an a ppreciable detrimental effect on the U.S. 
economy and could even push it into recession, particularly in light of the uncertain 
capacity of U.S. fiscal and monetary policy to counteract any materi al further weakening 
in real activity.  The risks to  the outlook are also boosted by th e “fiscal cliff” looming at 
the turn of the year; U.S. fiscal policymak ers, by choice or by gridlock, could impose 
considerably more restraint on the recovery than we have as sumed in the baseline.  These 
considerations also lead us to view the risks to economic activity as skewed to the 
downside.   
With regard to inflation, although we see substantial uncertainty about the 
outlook, we do not view the risk s as unusually high.  Long-run inflation expectations and 
actual inflation have remained remarkably stable  in recent years despite historically large 
fluctuations in unemployment, oil prices, a nd other relevant factors.  Moreover, we 
continue to see the risks surrounding our baseli ne forecast for inflation as balanced.  On 
the downside, low levels of resource utilization, subdued increases  in unit labor costs, and 
the possibility that economic conditions might be  less favorable than in the baseline could

  cause inflation to drift down over time.  On the upside, a larger amount of damage to the 
supply side of the economy might cause inflatio n to rise, as could concerns related to the 
size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet a nd the ability to execute a timely exit from 
the current stance of policy; a stronger reco very might also generate somewhat higher 
inflation. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline pr ojection using simulations of staff models.  The first two 
scenarios consider risks to the U.S. econom ic outlook associated with developments 
abroad.  In the first, a much more severe fiscal and financial crisis in Europe spills over to 
the United States and the rest of the gl obal economy; in the second, we analyze the 
effects on the U.S. economy of a marked sl owdown in the pace of economic growth in 
China and other Asian countries.  We then c onsider two scenarios that illustrate opposing 
risks to domestic demand—the downside risk associated with a fiscal cliff at the 
beginning of 2013, and the upside risk that the underlying pace of the recovery is more 
robust than the recent economic news would se em to suggest.  The last two scenarios 
focus on the supply side of the economy.  In one , we consider the possi bility that we have 
underestimated the extent of labor market damage that has already  occurred and thus 
have overestimated the amount of slack in reso urce utilization.  In the other, we consider 
the possibility that we have instead undere stimated how much the long-run productive 
capacity of the economy will be reduced in the future  if the level and duration of 
unemployment remain elevated.    
We generate the first two scenarios using the multicountry SIGMA model and 
build the last four scenarios using the FRB/US model.  For the simulations with the 
FRB/US model, we use the same estimated policy rule that governs the path of the 
federal funds rate in the base line.  For the simulations with  the SIGMA model, we use a 
different policy rule that employs an a lternative concept of resource utilization.1  In all of 
the scenarios, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow 
their baseline paths.  
                                                 
1 In particular, in the simulations using the FRB/US model, the federal funds rate follows the 
outcome-based rule described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.  In the simulations using SIGMA, 
the policy rule is broadly similar but uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output 
and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of a slow adjustment in 
wages and prices.

  European Crisis with  Severe Spillovers  
In this scenario, the current stress in European financial market conditions 
intensifies even further and causes Europe to plunge into a severe financial crisis and a 
deep recession.  This outcome could result fr om the exit of Greece from the euro area or 
widespread deposit runs, highlig hted as risks in the Inte rnational Economic Outlook and 
Development section of this Tealbook, but it c ould also reflect other triggers such as a 
disorderly sovereign default or the failure of a large European bank.2  Reflecting this 
intensified stress, both s overeign and private borrowing costs in Europe soar—with 
corporate bond spreads rising 400 basis point s above baseline—and the confidence of 
European households and businesses plummets .  Real GDP in Europe declines about 
9 percent relative to baseline by the end of 2013, not withstanding a 25 percent 
depreciation in the real e ffective foreign exchange value of the euro.  Europe’s 
difficulties are assumed to have important financial and economic spillovers to other 
parts of the world, including the United Stat es.  U.S. economic activity contracts sharply 
in response to a widening of U.S. corporate bond spreads of more th an 300 basis points, a 
much weaker stock market, reduced availabil ity of credit, and an erosion in household 
and business confidence.  In addition, weaker  foreign economic activ ity and the stronger 
exchange value of the dollar depr ess U.S. net exports.  All tol d, U.S. real GDP declines at 
an annual rate of 2¾ percent in  the second half of this year  and falls 3½ pe rcent in 2013.  
The unemployment rate climbs to 11½ percen t in 2014 before gradually receding.  With 
substantially greater re source slack and lower import prices , overall U.S. consumer prices 
fall in the second half of 2012 and in 2013;  inflation turns positive in 2014 as an 
economic recovery begins to take hold.3  Under these conditions, the federal funds rate 
remains at its effective lower bound until early 2017. 
                                                 
2 European policymakers could take more-sizable steps toward resolving the crisis than assumed 
in the baseline, thereby substantially easing financial and fiscal stresses and prompting a faster European 
recovery.  This possibility was analyzed in one of the alternative scenarios presented in the March 2012 
Tealbook. 
3 The rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects the forward-looking 
nature of inflation determination in SIGMA and a modest degree of structural inflation persistence.  In 
particular, long-run inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at 2 percent, producer marginal costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, and productivity is weaker (reflecting reduced capital spending).  In addition, import price inflation runs significantly  higher than in the baseline as the dollar’s initial 
appreciation is gradually reversed.  Under alternative specifications of SIGMA that, for instance, allow for 
more structural persistence in the inflation process or a less-firm anchoring of  inflation expectations, 
inflation would remain low for a longer period.

  Hard Landing in China 
Although real GDP growth in China has slowed  substantially in recent quarters, in 
our baseline forecast, we expect that China’ s economy will continue to expand at close to 
an 8 percent rate.  Nevertheless, important downside risks attend this outlook, including a 
real estate collapse or a shar p deceleration in the supply of  credit if problems mount in 
China’s banking sector.  In this scenario, despite stimulative government policies, GDP 
growth in China falls to only a 5 percent pace over the next two years due to tighter credit 
conditions, lower investment, and reduced confidence.  Moreover, we assume that China’s slowdown has pronounced global spillo vers, especially to other major U.S. 
trading partners in Asia.  All told, this causes the trade-weighted exchange value of the 
dollar to appreciate about 5 percent relative to baseline.  U.S. real net exports decline 
relative to baseline in response to weaker fo reign growth and the dol lar’s appreciation.  
U.S. real GDP expands at an annual rate of onl y about 1 percent in the second half of this 
year and in 2013, and the unemployment rate rises above 8½ percent by the end of 2013, 
about ½ percentage point higher th an in the baseline.  Core PC E inflation declines to just 
above 1 percent in 2013 and 2014 because of both the appreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and lower resource utilization.  The liftoff of the federal 
funds rate from its effective lowe r bound is delayed until late 2015. 
Fiscal Cliff 
Our baseline projection assumes that most expiring federa l tax provisions— 
including the tax cuts  initially enacted in  2001 and 2003, relief for most taxpayers from 
the alternative minimum tax, and a numb er of other non-stimulus-related tax 
reductions—will eventually be extended.4  In contrast, this scen ario assumes that all of 
these tax provisions are allowed to expire next year, thereby increasing household and 
business tax payments by more than 2 percent of GDP relative to baseline, and that the 
automatic spending cuts required by the sequestration associated with  the Budget Control 
Act take full effect in 2013, thus restraini ng federal purchases by a further ¼ percent of 
                                                 
4 As described in “Key Background Factors” of the Domestic Economic Developments and 
Outlook section, the staff’s baselin e forecast already assumes that the temporary payroll tax cut and the 
EUC program will expire at the beginning of next year, that federal discre tionary spending will be 
restrained by the caps set in the Budget Control Act and by reductions in defense spending as overseas 
military operations draw dow n, and that more-gradual deficit-redu ction policies will replace the automatic 
spending sequestration.  These policies account for a bout half of the restraint that would result from 
completely driving off the fiscal cliff at the turn of the year.

  GDP relative to baseline.5  In addition, these fiscal policy developments are assumed to 
weigh on consumer and business confidence by more than in the baseline.  As a result, 
real GDP expands only 1 percent in 2013 and 2¼ percent in 2014, on average 
1 percentage point per year slow er than in the baseline, and the unemployment rate is still 
8½ percent at the end of 2014.6  With a wider margin of slack in both labor and product 
markets, inflation edges down to 1¼ percent in  2014, and the federal funds rate does not 
begin to increase from its effective lower bound until late 2015.   
Faster Recovery 
This scenario assumes that both the staff and financial market participants have 
underestimated the future pace of the economic recovery, in part because  
seasonal-adjustment distortions and the unusually warm winter have obscured the 
underlying strength of the real economy in the past few months.  In addition, the  
greater-than-expected increases in house prices  since the beginning of the year turn out to 
signal that a significant headwind for the re covery is abating more rapidly than 
anticipated, with favorable implications for construction, household wealth, and the 
willingness of financial institutions to extend credit.  The scenario also incorporates a 
greater spur to investor sentiment next year from the gradual improvement in the 
European situation than is assumed in the baseline, leading to a steeper decline in 
financial risk premiums.  A ll of these factors contribute  to stronger consumption and 
business fixed investment that, in turn, fuel a cycle of increased confidence, employment, 
credit availability, and spending that boosts th e pace of the recovery further.  Real GDP 
accelerates in the second half of this year a nd expands at an average annual rate of more 
than 3½ percent in 2013 and 2014, helping to bring the unemployment rate down to  6½ percent by the end of 2014.  Upward pressure  on inflation is initially tempered by the 
effects of stronger capital investment on la bor productivity and unit labor costs, along 
with well-anchored long-run inflation expect ations.  Over time, however, tighter labor 
and product markets cause inflation to move noticeably above baseline.  In response to 
                                                 
5 After 2014, both tax rates and government sp ending gradually return to their baseline 
trajectories, leading eventually to budget deficits that  are about the same as in the baseline.  However, 
because those deficits follow a period of greater fiscal  stringency, the ratio of government debt to GDP is 
lower over the longer term in the alternative scenario. 
6 Although taxes increase by about 2 percent of GD P in 2013 in the alternative scenario relative to 
the baseline, the initial negative effect on real GDP next year is smaller as households in the FRB/US 
model adjust their spending gradually to the declin e in their disposable inco me; accordingly, real GDP 
growth in 2014 is also restrained.

  the stronger pace of real activity, the federal f unds rate begins to rise from its effective 
lower bound in the second half of this year. 
Damaged Labor Market  
The unusual depth and breadth of the downt urn may have impaired labor market 
efficiency, and thus boosted the NAIRU, by more than in the baseline.  In this scenario, 
we assume that the NAIRU reached 7 percen t in early 2011 (1 percentage point above 
baseline) and that it will remain at that leve l for the indefinite future.  Furthermore, the 
trend labor force participation rate declines more rapidly a nd is 1 percentage point below 
baseline by 2015.  These conditions imply lo wer long-run levels of household income 
and corporate earnings.  As a result, aggregate demand expands more slowly from here 
forward than in the baseline, and the unemplo yment rate falls only gradually over time.  
Nonetheless, slack remains persistently narrower in this scenario because of the higher 
NAIRU.  Less slack in labor markets in turn  implies higher unit labor costs and greater 
upward pressure on consumer prices.  This pr essure is magnified by policymakers’ initial 
failure to recognize the weaker  supply-side conditions, whic h leads them to maintain a 
more accommodative stance of monetary policy than they would have chosen with a 
perfect understanding of the supply side.  As  a result, the public’s long-run inflation 
expectations move up, and actual inflation follows suit.  Specifically, core PCE inflation 
reaches 2½ percent in 2015 and stays near th at level through 2017.  In response to these 
more inflationary conditions, the federal funds rate  begins to rise earlier and faster than in 
the baseline.  Although the supply-side damage in this scenario is assumed to be already 
“baked in the cake” and t hus cannot be reversed th rough monetary stimulus, 
policymakers could potentially achieve a be tter inflation outco me through a more 
aggressive policy tightening that keeps inflation expectati ons well-anchored. 
Future Labor Market Damage 
Unlike the previous scenario, in this scen ario, the staff estimate of the NAIRU is 
assumed to be about right currently.  None theless, barring acti on by policymakers, the 
continued underutilization of labor resources  is assumed to erode the skills and labor 
force attachment of worker s by enough to cause significant further damage to the 
economy’s productive potential in the future.  Specifically, the NAIRU is assumed to rise 
from its current level of 6 percent to 7 per cent by the end of 2014, a nd it remains at that 
level thereafter.  In addition, as in the previous scenario, the trend labor force 
participation declines to about 1 percentage  point below baseline by 2015.  Under these 
conditions, real GDP expands about ½ percentage poi nt less rapidly per year, on average,

  through 2017 than in the baseline, and th e unemployment rate falls more slowly.  As in 
the previous scenario, economic slack is tighter than in the baseline because of the more 
pronounced deterioration in the supply-sid e conditions of the economy, resulting in 
somewhat greater upward pressure on consum er prices.  And policymakers are similarly 
assumed to recognize the weaker supply c onditions only gradually, which delays the 
increase in the federal funds rate that woul d otherwise occur, and generates some upward 
pressure on the public’s long-run inflation exp ectations.  To the extent that the future 
damage to the supply side of the economy could be averted by stimulating the economy 
more aggressively in the near term, policymak ers might be motivated to undertake a more 
accommodative monetary policy at the cost of higher inflation.  
OUTSIDE FORECASTS  
In the June 10 report, which was based on responses collected on June 4 and 5, 
the Blue Chip consensus projection showed  real GDP rising 2.1 percent over the four 
quarters of 2012, ¼ percentage point above the staff forecast, and then increasing 
2.6 percent in 2013, ½ percentage point above  the staff projecti on.  The Blue Chip 
consensus forecast for the unemployment rate was 8 percent at the end of 2012, 
¼ percentage point below the staff proj ection, and 7½ percent at the end of 2013, 
½ percentage point below the staff projection;  the latter discrepancy would put the Blue 
Chip forecast at the 25th pe rcentile of the probability distribution around the staff 
unemployment forecast, based on historical staff errors.7  Regarding inflation, the 
consensus of Blue Chip panelists anticipate d that the overall CPI will increase 2 percent 
in 2012, 1 percentage point above the staff projecti on, and 2.2 percent in 2013, 
½ percentage point above the staff projection;  that discrepancy would put the Blue Chip 
forecast at the 70th percentile of the proba bility distribution around the staff inflation 
forecast.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaledby real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for changein HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
