Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received si nce the June Tealbook suggests that the 
recovery is proceeding at a more sluggish pace than we thought six weeks ago.  Incoming 
news on consumer spending, government purchases, private-sector  employment, and 
industrial production have all b een softer than expected, and we have marked down our 
estimate of real GDP growth in the first half  of this year from 1¾ percent to 1½ percent.1  
The recent data, combined with the disappoi nting tone of some more-forward-looking 
indicators, have led us to trim a similar am ount from our projection for real GDP growth 
in the second half of this year, which now also stands at an annual rate of about 
1½ percent.   
The current projection takes on board the continuation of the maturity extension 
program (MEP) that the Committee adopted in  June.  However, it also sees the 
underlying trajectory for economic activity as having weakened somewhat.  In our 
assessment, these two opposing influences are of roughly equal strength.  As a result, the 
contour of our medium-term projection is quite similar to the one in the previous 
Tealbook.  Although the situation in Europe remains a source of great uncertainty, thus 
far it appears to be unfolding approximately as  we had expected.  Financial stresses in 
Europe are anticipated to intensify further this  year and then recede slowly thereafter, as 
policymakers are finally impelled to take more-aggressive steps to avert a catastrophe.  
Similarly, we continue to assume that domestic fiscal policy will restrain economic growth considerably next year, but that fiscal policymakers will find a way to sidestep the 
even more severe consolidation that would en sue if all provisions of current law were 
allowed to take effect.  Taki ng into account these influences , we project that real GDP 
will rise 1½ percent this year, 2 percent next year, and 3¼ percent in 2014.  In addition to 
exerting important influences on the baseline forecast, the European financial crisis and 
domestic fiscal situation both continue to pose significant downside risks to the outlook. 
With growth in real GDP expected to be close to that of potential output through 
2013, no material progress is made in reducing th e slack in labor markets until late in the 
forecast period.  Indeed, we projec t that the jobless rate will tick up in the second half of 
                                                 
1 On Friday, the BEA will publish the annual revision to the national income and product accounts 
covering the first quarter of 2009 through the first quarter of 2012.  At the same time, they will release the 
advance GDP estimate for the second quarter of this year

 this year before edging down ¼ percentage point to a little over 8 percent by the end of 
2013.  Moreover, even the slight decline next year is attributable, in our reckoning, to the expiration at the beginning of the year of  the Emergency Unemployment Compensation 
(EUC) program.  By the end of 2014, the unemplo yment rate is expected to decrease to 
7¾ percent, about the same as  in the previous Tealbook. 
Readings on inflation have come in n ear our expectations, and the fundamental 
inflation picture remains as it has for some ti me:  With long-term inflation expectations 
assumed to remain well anchored but wide ma rgins of slack in labor and product markets 
expected to persist, our baseline forecast has inflation running at about 1½ percent over 
the medium term.  Compared with the June  Tealbook, our projection of total consumer 
price inflation this year is a bout ¼ percentage point higher, re flecting the recent rise in oil 
prices along with higher food pri ce inflation later this year th at is related to the current 
drought in the Midwest.  Beyond this year, our inflation forecast is l ittle revised.     
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
The stance of monetary polic y is slightly more accomm odative in this projection.  
In line with the prescriptions from the esti mated outcome-based policy rule, we assume 
that liftoff of the target federal funds rate from its effective lower bound will occur in the 
fourth quarter of 2014, one quart er later than in the June  Tealbook.  In addition, our 
assumed portfolio-related policy now reflects the extension of the MEP that the FOMC 
announced after the June meeting.  We assume  no additional balance-sheet actions over 
the projection period. 
The path of the federal funds rate woul d differ if we had chosen some other 
method to set it.2  As discussed in Book B, liftoff would occur in the second quarter of 
2015 if we had used a rule that targets the level of nominal GDP, and not until the second 
quarter of 2016 under a standard optimal control exercise with commitment.3  Liftoff 
would occur in the same quarter as in the baseline if we had followed the prescriptions of 
the Taylor (1999) rule.  In c ontrast, the Taylor (1993) rule and the first-difference rule 
                                                 
2 For details on the outcome-based and other policy rules, see the appendix on policy rules in 
Book B. 
3 The optimal control policy noted here is conducted under the strong assumption that, if economic 
conditions were to evolve as expected, future polic ymakers would remain committed to the plan currently 
judged to be optimal.  If future policymakers were instead assumed to follow a discretionary policy of 
reoptimizing over time, then the optimal-control liftoff date would shift back to the second quarter of 2015.

 call for a liftoff of the federal f unds rate that is earlier than  under the outcome-based rule; 
indeed, the Taylor (1993) rule  prescribes an immediate and substantial increase in the 
target federal funds rate.4 
Other Interest Rates 
The yield on 10-year Treasury securities  has decreased about 25 basis points, on 
net, since the June Tealbook.  This decline reflects weaker -than-expected economic news, 
safe-haven flows related to ongoing concerns  about the euro-area situation, and the 
announced continuation of the MEP, which was only partly priced in to yields at the time 
of the June Tealbook.  Over the projection pe riod, the MEP is expected to hold down the 
10-year Treasury yield by about 10 basis points.  Through early 2013, Treasury yields 
continue to be damped by safe-haven de mands stemming from the European financial 
crisis and the effects of uncertainty about the U.S. fiscal situation on the pace of the 
economic recovery.  As these concerns abate and the economic recovery strengthens, the 
path of Treasury yields rises, reflecting the movement of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of nea r-zero short-term interest rates, along with a gradual waning of 
the effects of nonconventional monetary policy.  In total, the 10-year Treasury rate 
increases by 2 percentage points over the forecast horizon, bringing the rate to around 
3½ percent by late 2014. 
 Yields on investment-grade corporat e bonds have decreased roughly 40 basis 
points since the June Tealbook, about 20 basis points more than yields on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities.  Over the proj ection period, we assume that the spread on 
BBB-rated bonds will hold fairly steady un til early 2013 and then narrow nearly a full 
percentage point by the end of 2014 as the recove ry accelerates.  As a result, interest rates 
on BBB-rated bonds increase only half as much as those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities and are projected to be about 5¼ pe rcent by the end of 2014.  In 
contrast, conventional mortgage rate s largely follow Treasury rates. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
Broad U.S. stock price indexes have edged up about 1 percent, on net, since the 
June Tealbook.  We project only a modest increase in stock prices through early 2013, as 
concerns about the circumstances in Europe and the effects of the U.S. fiscal situation are 
                                                 
4 All of these estimates allow for dynamic feedback  from the stance of monetary policy to the real 
economy and inflation, which can have important implications for the estimated timing of tightening under 
the different rules.

 assumed to continue to weigh on the confiden ce of market participants.  With these 
tensions anticipated to ease thereafter, equity  prices are projected to  rise about 10 percent 
on average in each of 2013 and 2014.  
The CoreLogic house price index rose in May about in line with our expectations.  
We continue to expect that the brisk pace of house price increases observed in the first 
half of 2012 will slow consider ably later this year, partly in response to an expected 
increase in foreclosure proceedings, as fi ve large mortgage servicers make progress 
implementing the terms of the settlement with  the State Attorneys General.  In total, 
house prices are expected to rise 5 percent this  year and then increase at the more modest 
average rate of about 2 percent in 2013 and 2014. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are essentially unchanged in this forecast and 
continue to imply that federal fiscal polic y will exert a substantial drag on economic 
growth in the medium term.  In particular, we  still assume that the temporary payroll tax 
cut and the EUC program will expire at the beginning of next year, as scheduled under 
current law.  We also continue to assume  that federal discretionary spending will be 
restrained by the caps in the Budget Control Act and by reduc tions in defense spending as 
overseas military operations are scaled back.  However, the additional cuts scheduled to 
take effect in January 2013 under the automa tic sequestration stipulated by the Budget 
Control Act are assumed to be replaced by more-gradual budget measures that achieve 
the same amount of cumulative deficit reduction through fiscal year 2021.  We have also maintained our assumption that most federal tax provisions set to expire at the end of this 
year under current law will not, in fact, be  allowed to expire, but instead will be 
eventually extended.
5  These provisions include the tax cuts initially en acted in 2001 and 
2003, relief for most taxpayers from the alte rnative minimum tax, and a number of other 
non-stimulus-related tax reductions. 
The legislative process for extending th ese tax cuts, along with replacing the 
automatic spending sequestration with deficit reduction measures that are more gradual, 
is likely to be contentious a nd protracted.  Accordingly, the baseline projection envisions 
that the process for reaching agreement w ill probably involve a number of short-term 
                                                 
5 In addition, we assume that the debt ceiling will be lifted in time to avert a default on the 
federal debt.

 extensions at the end of this year and in 2013.  This legislative wrangling is assumed to 
weigh on household and business confidence.   
We continue to expect fiscal policy in the aggregate will directly  restrain the rate 
of real GDP growth (excluding multiplier effects) by ½ percentage point this year, 
1 percentage point in 2013, and ¼ percentage  point in 2014.  Reflecting both the assumed 
fiscal policy tightening and an anticipated acceleration in tax revenues as the economic 
recovery strengthens, the budge t deficit is projected to narrow from $1.1 trillion 
(7¼ percent of GDP) in the current fiscal ye ar to about $700 billion (4 percent of GDP) in 
fiscal 2014.   
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
We estimate that foreign real GDP grow th slowed to 2¼ percent in the second 
quarter, reflecting a decelerati on in emerging market economies  as well as a contraction 
in Europe.  We continue to expect rapid fiscal consolidation a nd elevated financial 
stresses to be a major drag on real GDP growth  in Europe in the near term, while activity 
elsewhere should expand at a moderate pace.  As in the June Tealbook, we anticipate that 
financial tensions related to Europe will increa se in the near term before starting to ease 
next year.  This easing, in conjunction with supportive monetary conditions, should pave 
the way for a gradual pickup in foreign GDP gr owth from 2¼ percen t in the second half 
of this year to 3¼ percent in 2014.  Of cour se, this outlook remains quite uncertain as 
European policymakers still must overcome major hurdles in or der to address their fiscal 
and banking-sector vulnerabilities. 
Since the June Tealbook, the dollar is about unchanged, on net, as it appreciated 
against the euro but depreciated against most other currencies.  We expect the dollar to 
appreciate into the fourth quarter of 2012, si milar to our projection in the June Tealbook 
and in line with our assumption that the euro-a rea crisis is likely to worsen in the near 
term.  Thereafter, as financial stresses begin to  ease, the dollar is pr ojected to depreciate 
at about a 3½ percent annual rate through the end of 2014. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
The spot price of Brent crude oil closed  at $104 per barrel on July 23, up about 
$8 since the time of the June Tealbook.6  The increase follows a sharp decline from late 
                                                 
6 The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil closed on July 23 at $89 per barrel, 
about $6 higher than at the time of the June Tealbook.

 March through late June that  was driven largely by greater  pessimism regarding global 
economic growth and an easing of concerns  regarding Iran.  The subsequent rebound in 
crude oil prices appears to reflect a resu rgence in tensions with Iran and increased 
violence in the Middle East.  Brent futures prices have also moved higher, although by 
less than the spot price, causing the Brent futures curve to become more steeply 
downward sloping.  Our current projection calls for the price of imported oil to gradually 
decline from $97 per barrel in the current qua rter—a level that is over $8 higher than in 
the previous projection—to $85 per barrel at  the end of 2014, slightly below the June 
Tealbook.  
A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices  is about unchanged from the time of 
the June Tealbook, as a jump in food prices about offset d eclining prices for industrial 
metals.  Poor growing conditions in the Un ited States and overseas, and consequent 
downward revisions to production forecasts, have  pushed up prices for most field crops, 
with corn and soybean prices reaching record highs.  In contrast, metals prices have fallen, on net, likely reflecting concerns over global growth.  For the projection period, 
we expect nonfuel commodity prices to decline slightly. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
Economic activity now appears to have increased at an even more modest pace 
during the first half of this year than we had anticipated  in June, and the available 
indicators for the second half  are a little less encouraging as well.  After folding in 
generally softer spending data, primaril y for consumption expenditures and defense 
outlays, we now estimate that real GDP rose at  an annual rate of about 1 percent in the 
second quarter, compared with the 1½ percent increase we had forecast previously.  The data for household spending, along with news from the employment report, capital goods 
orders, and the downbeat tone of the handful of indicators we have for July, led us to 
shave our projection for GDP growth in the second half by a little more than 
¼ percentage point, to an average annual rate of a bout 1½ percent. 
The Labor Market 
After improving significantly during the la te fall and winter , conditions in the 
labor market have shown little to no net change  over the past several months, with private 
payrolls posting mediocre gains and the unempl oyment rate leveling out.  Compared with 
the June Tealbook, the incoming labor market news has been just a little below our 
expectations.

 Private employment rose about 90,000 per month in the second quarter, well 
below the average gains of 225,000 per month in the first quarter.  While we estimate that 
some of this deceleration can be explained by a payback from the warm winter weather 
and distortions to seasonal adjustment relate d to the sharp employment declines in late 
2008 and early 2009, we also discern a genuine weakening in labor market conditions:  
Abstracting from weather and seasonal infl uences as well as noise in the data, the 
underlying pace of private payroll gains app ears to have slowed from about 195,000 per 
month in the first quarter to about 130,000 pe r month in the second quarter.  Meanwhile, 
the unemployment rate remained at 8.2 pe rcent in June, and initial claims for 
unemployment insurance have continued to be in a range consistent with only modest job 
gains in coming months. 
Taken together, the recent data on the la bor market and our less favorable outlook 
for the broader economy have led us to w eaken slightly our n ear-term employment 
forecast.  We now expect the pace of private employment gains to average about 110,000 
per month over the rest of the year, a littl e lower than our projection in the June 
Tealbook.  We expect the unemployment rate to  tick up to 8.3 percent in the second half 
of the year, just a bit higher th an in our previous projection. 
The Industrial Sector 
Manufacturing production increased at an annual rate of only 1½ percent in the 
second quarter, a dramatic step-down from th e nearly 10 percent pace registered in the 
first quarter.  Unusually warm weather this winter and the resolution of motor vehicle supply chain disruptions relate d to last year’s natural di sasters in Japan and Thailand 
likely contributed to the earlier surg e and subsequent pullback in factory 
production.  Nonetheless, we think that the bu lk of the slowdown represents an actual 
weakening of conditions in the manufacturing sector and cannot be attributed to these 
special factors.  (For a discussion on labor  market conditions in manufacturing, see the 
box “Skilled Labor Shortages in  the Manufacturing Sector.”) 
Furthermore, nearly all of the indicators of manufacturing activity  in the near term 
have weakened in recent months.  In partic ular, both the ISM new orders index and the 
average of the indexes from the regional surveys slipped below 50 in June, and the available surveys for July remain downbeat.  As a result, we have revised down our near-
term projection for factory output, and we  now expect manufacturing production to

 Skilled Labor Shortages  in the Manufacturing  Sector 
Anecdotal  reports suggest  that some firms have been struggling  to find sufficient  numbers  of 
skilled workers.   For instance,  over the  past year, Beige Books  have repeatedly  cited this concern;  
the June edition mentioned  “widespread  reports that firms continued  to face difficulty  finding 
highly trained or skilled workers—especially in  information  technology,  engineering,  and 
manufacturing  fields” (page vii).  Here  we focus on the manufacturing  sector.  Although  
manufacturing  accounts  for only around 11 percent of private employment,  the reports of labor 
shortages  are often specific to this sector.1  Indeed, earlier this  year, inquiries  conducted  by the 
Philadelphia  and New York Federal Reserve  Banks suggested  that skilled labor  shortages  were a 
significant  factor restraining  hiring in the manufacturing  sector—though slow  expected  growth of 
sales and a desire to keep costs low were the most important  reasons cited.2   
Further information  about the extent of  skilled labor  shortages  in manufacturing—and,  
importantly,  how they have changed  over time—can  be seen in data from the Census Bureau’s  
Quarterly  Survey of Plant Capacity  (QSPC).  The QSPC, which is  jointly funded by the Federal 
Reserve Board and the Department  of Defense,  provides  the data used to benchmark  the Federal 
Reserve Boar d’s measures  of manufacturing  capacity.   The survey  asks roughly 7,500 plant 
managers  about their plants’ actual production  and total sustainable  productive  capacities,  and, 
when applicable,  the reasons that plants are operating  at less than  capacity.    
As shown in  the figure and table below, “Insufficient  supply of loca l labor force/skills” was  cited as 
a factor restraining  production  by more than 20 percent of  respondents  in the late 1990s and by 
nearly 15 percent during the expansionary  period leading up to the most recent recession.3  The 
share of plant managers  choosing  this reason plummeted  to less than  2 percent during the  
 
   
 
 
                                                 
1 For instance,  the National Association  of Manufacturers  stated in its 2011  Skills Gap Report that skilled labor 
shortages  were a pressing problem within manufacturing,  but noted that “[t]his problem is not new” (p. 1). 
2 “Cannot  find workers with required skills” was  the third most frequently  named factor in the case of New

recession.   The share  reporting  that skills shortages  were a restraint  on production  has moved up  
somewhat  since then:   As of the first quarter of this year, the proportion  had risen to 7½ percent.  
Nevertheless,  this share remains below its historical  average,  and moreover, it  is consistent  with a 
regression‐ based  prediction using  the unemployment  rate and the manufacturing  capacity 
utilization  rate.  Both historically  and currently,  the dominant  reason cited by plant managers  for 
operating  at less than capacity has been “Insufficient  orders” (the  red line in the figure); this 
reason was  chosen by 83 percent of respondents  in the first quarter of this year and  remains above 
its long‐run average.4 
Even when the QSPC  data are disaggregated  to the level of major industries  within the  
manufacturing  sector, they  suggest that skilled labor  shortages  are not a major factor  restraining  
production.   The figure  below presents  results for two industries  that are frequently  mentioned  in 
press reports as facing labor shortages:  machinery  and fabricated  metals.  Plant managers  in these 
industries  historically  have been significantly  more likely than other managers  to report  that skilled 
labor shortages  are restraining  production.   However, even for these  two industries, the  share of 
survey respondents  in recent quarters  who cited  skilled labor  shortages  as a reason for operating  
below capacity has remained  well below  the share before the recession.    
All told, while some skilled labor  shortages  are being reported  in the manufacturing  sector, the  
extent to which  these shortages  are restraining  production  appears about in line with the current 
weakness in  the labor market and the degree of slack in the manufacturing  sector.  Furthermore,  
the finding that skilled labor shortages  are not a significant  and widespread  restraint  on production  
is consistent  with recent  subdued  increases  in manufacturing  wages. 
                                                 
4 In addition to “Insufficient  orders” and “Insufficient  supply of local labor force/skills,”  the other choices are:  
“Not most profitable  to operate  at capacity,”  “Sufficient  inventory  of finished goods on hand,” “Insufficient  supply 
of materials,”  “Equipment  limitations,”  “Seasonal  operations,”  “Lack of sufficient  fuel or electrical  energy,” 
“Storage  limitations,”  “Logistics/transportation  constraints,”  “Strike  or work  stoppage,”  and “Environmental  
restrictions.”   Respondents  may  choose as many factors as are applicable.

 increase at an annual rate of 1¾ percent in  the second half of this year, more than 
1 percentage point below the pace projected in the June Tealbook. 
Household Spending 
After having risen at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the first qu arter, real PCE is 
estimated to have increased only 1 percent last  quarter, noticeably less than projected in 
the June Tealbook.  If not for a rebound in spending on energy services following the 
unusually mild winter, the slowdown would have been still more pronounced.  To be 
sure, a decline in outlays for motor vehicles, a volatile component of spending, was an 
important part of the second-quarter deceler ation, and we expect a rebound in this 
category in the second half.  Still, with consumer sentiment downbeat and the incoming news on retail sales weaker th an expected, we have marked down our projection of real 
PCE growth about ¼ percentage point over the second ha lf of this year, to an annual rate 
of 2¼ percent.   
 We estimate that real disposable persona l income (DPI) accelerated in the second 
quarter to an annual rate of 2½ percent afte r having barely increas ed over the preceding 
year.  The sharp drop in consumer energy pr ices following their first-quarter increases 
played an important role in last quarter’s acceleration.  Declining energy prices and 
ongoing growth in nominal income should continue to boost households’ purchasing 
power in the second half.  With weak consum er spending data and firming real income, 
the personal saving rate, which had fallen to a surprisingly low level in the first quarter, 
has edged up in recent months, a trend we expect to continue in the second half.    
Housing activity appears to be on a gradua l uptrend, albeit from a very depressed 
level.  Smoothing as best we can through the volatility associated  with the unseasonably 
warm weather last winter, single-family hous ing starts and permits look to have moved 
up a little from their levels late last year.  In addition, some signs  indicate that housing 
demand is slowly improving:  Both new and existing home sales have edged up over the 
past year, on balance, and—as was noted earl ier—measures of house prices have turned 
up since the beginning of the year.  Nonethel ess, given the ongoing restraint on demand 
from difficult credit conditions and uncertain ty about employment and income prospects, 
as well as the likelihood that the still-abundant stock of relatively inexpensive vacant 
houses will continue to divert demand from new construction, we project that single-
family starts will increase only sli ghtly over the rest of the year.

 In contrast, construction activity in th e multifamily sector has picked up more 
rapidly than in the single-family sector in the past several years, likely in response to 
rising rents and falling vacancy rates, as many of the factors restraining home purchases 
have increased demand for rental units.  We e xpect these conditions to persist, and so we 
project that multifamily starts will co ntinue to move up in coming months.   
Business Investment  
After rising at a modest annual rate of 3½ percent in the first quarter, real business 
spending on equipment and software (E&S) appe ars to have risen at an annual rate of 
nearly 7 percent in the second quarter.  Howe ver, we view the second-quarter pace as 
unlikely to be sustained:  Over the past th ree months, new orders for capital goods have 
declined noticeably and the backlog of unfilled orders has decelerated sharply.  
Moreover, forward-looking indicators of business investment have also softened in recent 
months, partly reflecting concer ns about the situati on in Europe.  Notably, indexes from 
various recent surveys of business conditions  have dropped to low levels and analysts’ 
earnings expectations for capital  goods producers have deteriorat ed.  As a result, we have 
trimmed our forecast for the increase in E&S sp ending over the second half of this year to 
an annual rate of less than 3 percent, 2 percentage points le ss than in the June Tealbook. 
Following a period of surprising streng th through much of 2011, spending on 
nonresidential constructi on (excluding drilling and mining) rose at a more moderate pace 
in the first half of this year, a deceleration in line with the sector’s weak fundamentals.  
Although there are hints of some easing in financing conditions for existing commercial real estate, we anticipate that  high vacancy rates, low commer cial real estate prices, and 
difficult financing conditions for new construction will continue to put downward pressure on building activity for the foreseeable future.  Meanwhile, investment in the drilling and mining sector appears to have tu rned down in the first half of 2012 following 
the brisk increases seen in 2010 and 2011.  Th is downturn is probably related to the 
sizable decline in natural gas prices over th e past year.  Outlays for drilling and mining 
structures are expected to edge up some, on ba lance, over the rest of the year as natural 
gas prices have recently moved back up somewhat. 
 Firms in the nonfarm business sector appear to have accumulated inventories in 
the first half of this year at a moderate pace,  only a little above that in the fourth quarter 
of last year.  Available estimates from  the staff’s flow-of-goods system, book-value 
measures of the inventory-to-s ales ratio, reports on dealer inventories of motor vehicles,

 and surveys of inventory satisfa ction and plans all indicate that overall inventory stocks 
are fairly well aligned with sales.  With producers thought to be a pprehensive about the 
sustainability of the recovery, we expect the pace of stockbu ilding to rise slowly and to 
contribute only modestly to real GDP growth over the rest of the year. 
Government  
We estimate that real federal purchases fe ll at an annual rate of 4½ percent in the 
second quarter, a steeper decline than we had anticipated in the June Tealbook.  In the 
second half of the year, we an ticipate that the downtrend in these expenditures will slow 
to a 2½ percent rate—a pace we judge to be  more in line with budget appropriations.  
Purchases by state and local governments have also continued to contract.  We estimate 
that real state and local purcha ses fell at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second quarter, 
but we expect that these expenditures will only edge down in the second half, as the 
declines in both the payrolls and construc tion spending of these governments moderate.  
Taken together, federal, state, and local purchases are expected to subtract ½ percentage 
point from the rate of real GDP growth this year. 
Foreign Trade  
Real exports of goods and services are es timated to have increased at an annual 
rate of 4½ percent in the second quarter, supported by both moderate growth in emerging 
market economies and previous dollar depreciat ion.  Over the second half of this year, we 
expect real export growth to move down to a 3¼ percent pace, as th e dollar rises and the 
positive effect of previous declines fades.  Meanwhile, real imports are estimated to have 
increased 3¼ percent in the second quarter of this year; this estimat e is 1¼ percentage 
points lower than in the June Tealbook, main ly due to a large dow nward revision to our 
estimate of oil imports.  Over the second half  of 2012, we expect real import growth to 
step up to an average pace of 4¾ percent, boosted by the rising dollar over the remainder of this year.  All told, net exports are now estimated to have been neutral for real GDP 
growth in the second quarter, an upward revision of about ¼ percentage point relative to 
the June Tealbook, but we anticipate that they  will subtract about ½ percentage point 
from real GDP growth in the second half of the year, roughly unchanged from the June 
projection.   
Prices and Wages  
The incoming data on inflation have genera lly been close to our expectations, and 
we continue to estimate that total PCE pri ce inflation stepped down from an annual rate

 of 2½ percent in the first quarter to ar ound ¾ percent in the second quarter, largely 
reflecting the sharp drop in energy prices in the spring.  In the current quarter, we 
anticipate that consumer prices will again rise  at a ¾ percent pace, up somewhat from the 
June Tealbook because the partial rebound in oil prices in recent weeks points to a less 
dramatic decline in gasoline prices.  Later th is year, a flattening in  retail energy prices 
and a pickup in PCE food price inflation are expected to push tota l PCE inflation back up 
to about 1½ percent. 
Lower-than-expected data on consumer food prices in May led us to revise down 
our estimate for PCE food price inflation in the second quarter to an  annual rate of just 
¾ percent.  However, grain pri ces rose rapidly in late June and early July as a wide swath 
of the country was scorched by hot, dry weather, which cut the US DA’s projections of 
crop yields considerably.  Compared with its  level at the time of the June Tealbook, a 
weighted average of crop-related futures pri ces is currently about 25 percent higher; an 
average of projected livestock prices also has increased, t hough by much less.  Typically, 
the immediate pass-through of farm commodity price increases  into PCE food prices is 
limited, and our third-quarter pr ojection is only a little higher than in the June Tealbook.  
However, we anticipate that the pass-thr ough will pick up steam in the fourth quarter, 
with retail food prices increas ing at an annual rate of 3¼ pe rcent, an upward revision of 
about 1¾ percentage points from the June T ealbook.  Still, given the relatively small 
weight of food prices in overall inflation, this upward revision has only a minor effect on 
total consumer price inflation. 
Core PCE price inflation was boosted in the first quarter by a transitory jump in 
the price increases of both core goods and serv ices in January; since then, these prices 
have risen at a more subdued pace, consistent  with our estimate that the annual rate of 
core price inflation was 1¾ percent in the sec ond quarter.  We expect core PCE inflation 
to edge down further to an annual rate of 1½ percent over the second half of 2012, as core 
goods prices decelerate in line with the slowing in import and commodity prices.  The 
slightly slower pace of core inflation in th e second half is consistent with the recent 
downturn in the price index for core intermediate materials, which fell at an annual rate 
of 3 percent over the three months ending in June.   
Regarding wages, following two quarters of  being essentially flat, compensation 
per hour in the nonfarm business se ctor is estimated to have in creased at an annual rate of 
2 percent in the second quarter, close to our expectations in the June Tealbook.  We

 project that hourly compensation will rise during the second ha lf of this year at roughly 
that same pace. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
Although our near-term outlook has soften ed, our medium-term projection for 
GDP growth has changed little since the June  Tealbook, in large part because we have 
taken on board the extension of the MEP.  After increasing 1½ percent this year, real 
GDP is projected to rise 2 percent next year and 3¼ per cent in 2014.  As before, the 
modest acceleration in real GDP is supported by further expected improvements in 
financial conditions, an eventual easing of the financial crisis in Europe, and rising 
household and business confidence in the durabil ity of the recovery.  While the tightening 
of fiscal policy is anticipat ed to impose a substantial drag on economic growth in 2013, 
these effects are expected to ease considerab ly in 2014.  A number of other factors also 
still weigh on the outlook, including tight cr edit in some markets, an overhang of vacant 
homes restraining housing ac tivity, and subdued foreign demand.  As a result, the 
projected recovery remains subpar, and we an ticipate that the jobless rate will not drop 
below 8 percent until 2014—when real GDP finally starts to grow mate rially faster than 
potential.    
Part of the fiscal restraint in our projec tion for real GDP growth shows up directly 
as declines in government purchases.  As in our previous proj ection, real federal 
purchases are anticipated to drop more th an 4 percent in both  2013 and 2014, reflecting 
the expected effects of the Budget Control Act and a further drawdown of overseas 
military operations.  The recovery in the purchases of state and local governments is projected to be quite slow, as fiscal conditions in the sector are likely to remain tight for 
some time, partly reflecting the relatively slow pace of the broader economic recovery.  
Although state tax revenues have been rising at  a reasonable rate, local taxes, which are 
dominated by property taxes, have been stagnant, and the stimulus-rel ated federal grants 
have essentially ended.  As a consequence, re al state and local purchases are expected to 
just edge up in 2013 and to rise at only a tepid pace in 2014.  
The large fiscal drag we expect next year  also shows through indirectly in other 
categories of aggregate spending.  In part icular, the anticipated expiration of the 
temporary payroll tax cut and the EUC program at the end of this year impart significant 
restraint on consumer spending next year.  None theless, real PCE grow th is expected to 
expand 2¼ percent next year, supported by, among other factors, a rebound in household

 confidence that is expected to accompany th e easing in financial conditions once the 
situation in Europe begins to resolve and the threat of a domestic fiscal calamity recedes.  
In 2014, we project that consumer spending wi ll accelerate further, as fiscal restraint 
ebbs, employment prospects improve, and household net worth cont inues to rise.   
Real exports are projected to increase a subdued 3¾ percent next year, held back 
by weak demand from the advanced fo reign economies—notably Europe—before 
stepping up to a 5½ percent pace in 2014, boos ted by increasing foreign growth and a 
depreciating dollar.  Meanwhile , real imports are expected to  rise at an average pace of 
4½ percent in 2013 and 2014.  Overall, net trad e is expected to make a small negative 
contribution to growth in 2013 and then be a neutral factor in 2014, about the same as in 
the previous projection.  
With sluggish demand emanating from the government, consumer, and foreign 
sectors, businesses likely see little reason to expand capacity significantly.  Despite the 
fact that large firms have ample cash on hand, we project that the business sector as a 
whole will remain cautious un til the recovery is clearly on a stronger footing.  We 
therefore expect expenditures on E&S to strengthen only gradually over the medium 
term, to an average annual rate of 5¾ per cent in 2013 and 2014, similar to our previous 
projection.  These same factors, along w ith persistently high vacancy rates, are 
restraining investment in struct ures (other than drilling and mi ning).  As a result, we still 
foresee small declines through next year and only small gains in 2014.  In contrast, 
investment in drilling and mining is expect ed to turn back up over the medium term 
following this year’s retreat, as the continued deployment of horizontal drilling 
techniques should keep spending growth in this sector at respectable rates . 
We continue to expect the recovery in housing constructi on to be slow.  
Ordinarily, historically low mo rtgage rates would be expect ed to provide a substantial 
boost to home purchases and to new construc tion over the medium term.  However, this 
impetus is likely to continue to be mark edly attenuated by ongoing difficulties for many 
households in accessing mortgage credit and by persistent uncertainty about job and 
income prospects.  In addition, the flow of homes from forecl osure into the resale market 
is expected to remain substantial, keeping the stock of vacant hous es at a high level and 
thus limiting the demand for new construction.   Accordingly, we project single-family 
housing starts to move up only gradually ove r the forecast period to a little over 650,000

 units in 2014, still around half of the av erage rate over the past 40 years and little 
changed from our June projection. 
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the NAIRU 
We have made no changes to our estimates of aggregate supply in this projection.  
We continue to assume that potential GDP  will increase roughly 2 percent through 2014, 
and we have retained our assumption that the NAIRU will remain at 6 percent over that 
period.7 
The Labor Market  
Although we expect the pace of privat e employment growth to rebound some 
from the slow pace in the second and third qu arters, private job gain s are anticipated to 
remain subdued, averaging only about 120,000 pe r month in 2013, a bit less than in our 
June forecast.  With this s ubpar rate of job creation, it is only the expiration of the EUC 
program—and the accompanying exit of those i ndividuals who remained in the labor 
force to maintain eligibility for benefits—t hat induces the unemployment rate to drift 
down at all, from 8¼ percent currently to 8 percent by the end of 2013.  In 2014, stronger 
growth in aggregate demand pushes up job gains to 200,000 per month and reduces the 
unemployment rate to 7¾ percent by the end of that year, roughly the same level as in the 
June Tealbook.   
Resource Utilization 
As in our previous projec tion, labor market slack remains substantial throughout 
our medium-term forecast, with the unemploym ent rate still 1¾ percentage points above 
our estimate of the NAIRU at the end of 2014.  Likewise, our estimate of the output gap 
only narrows materially in 2014, ending th e projection at negative 3½ percent. 
Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly incorporates trends in 
labor input, our concept of capacity for the i ndustrial sector focuses on the capability of 
plants to produce with the equipment that is  in place and ready to operate; it does not take 
account of the potential workforce, either insi de the industrial sector or outside of it.  
                                                 
7 We estimate that the boost to the “eff ective” NAIRU from the emergency and extended 
unemployment insurance programs has diminished and is worth only about ¼ percentage point at present.  
The gap between the two measures is expected to clos e completely next year as these programs are fully 
wound down.

 From the end of 2007 through 2010, factory capacity plunged about 6 percent.  As a 
result, resource utilization in the industrial s ector is currently highe r than in the broader 
economy; indeed, capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector in June was 
77.7 percent, only about 1 percentage point  below its long-run average rate.  Our 
projection calls for the factory operating rate to rise grad ually over the projection period, 
reaching its long-run average by the end of 2014 despite a still-sizable GDP gap. 
Prices and Compensation 
We expect inflation to remain low a nd steady over the medium term.  The 
stability of inflation expectations in recent years, which we expect to continue in the projection period, is one importa nt factor underpinning our inflation trajectory.  Readings 
on longer-term inflation expectations have remained little change d since the previous 
Tealbook.  The median 5-to-10-year-ahead in flation expectation from the Michigan 
survey stood at 2.8 percent in July, well with in the narrow range seen over the last few 
years.  The TIPS-based measure of inflation compensation for the next 5 years is about 
unchanged since the Tealbook, and the correspo nding measure for 5-to-10 years ahead is 
down about 20 basis points. 
Import prices are another factor that we  expect to contribute to continued low 
inflation, especially in the s econd half of this year when the lagged effects of a rising 
dollar and previous declines in commodity prices  are expected to lead to a decline in core 
import prices.  In 2013 and 2014, core import pri ce inflation is expected to rise to an 
annual rate of just 1¼ percent, consistent  with our projection for modest dollar 
depreciation and a relatively flat  trajectory for commodity prices. 
These factors, together with the consider able underut ilization in la bor and product 
markets expected over the medium term, lead  us to project core inflation rates of 
1.5 percent in the second half of 2012 and 1.6 percent in both 2013 and 2014.   After 
posting sizable declines in the near term, retail energy prices are anticipated to continue 
to edge lower over the next c ouple of years, consistent with  our assumed path for crude 
oil prices.  For that reason, headline infla tion is expected to r un a little below core 
inflation in both 2013 and 2014 despite modest upward pressure from food prices, as the 
recent run-up in farm commodity prices passes through to retail prices late this year and 
early next year.  With these low rates of cons umer price inflation a nd the wide margin of 
slack in the labor market, nonfarm hourly co mpensation and the empl oyment cost index 
are each projected to rise less th an 3 percent in both 2013 and 2014.

 THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff’s forecast through 2020 using the FRB/US model and 
our assumptions about long-run supply-side co nditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  
The contour of the long-term outlook de pends on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE in flation at 2 percent, consistent with 
the Committee’s strategy statement after the January 2012 meeting.  The 
federal funds rate continues to be set according to the estimated outcome-
based rule. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates over the 2014–17 period.  However, as 
the time of portfolio normalization draws nearer, this downward pressure 
wanes, and that waning contributes to th e rise in the 10-year Treasury yield.  
Beyond 2017, the process of normalization should be essentially completed. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds decrease gradually to normal 
levels, and banks further eas e their lending standards. 
 The federal government budget deficit (m easured on a NIPA basis) narrows 
somewhat further, from 4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3¾ percent of GDP in 
2017, as the boost to tax receipts from  the expanding economy slightly 
outpaces gains in federal spending.  Meanwhile, federal debt held by the 
public remains around 75 percent of GDP.  After 2017, the deficit widens 
again and the ratio of federal debt to GDP begins to increase because of fast-
rising transfer payments for reti rement and health-care programs. 
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates 2¼  percent per year 
from 2014 to 2017.  The pace of dollar depr eciation tapers off thereafter.  The 
price of crude oil is roughly flat from 2014 to 2016 and then holds steady in real terms.  Foreign real GDP rises at an average annual rate of 3½ percent in 2015 through 2017 and then gradually edges down to a 3 percent pace by late in the decade. 
 The NAIRU declines from 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 
5¼ percent at the end of 2017 as conditions  in the labor market continue to 
improve, and it remains at 5¼ percent in the long run.  Potential GDP

 increases at an average annual rate  of around 2½ percent from 2015 through 
the end of the decade.     
The economy is projected to enter 2015 with output still below its potential level, 
the unemployment rate above the assumed NAIRU, and inflation lowe r than the long-run 
objective of the Committee.  In the staff’s long-term forecast, further improvements in 
household and business confidence, dimi nishing uncertainty, and more-supportive 
financial conditions enable real GDP to rise at an average annual ra te of about 3½ percent 
from 2015 through 2017.  With real GDP expanding at a pace faster than the growth rate 
of potential output, labor market  conditions improve further, and the unemployment rate 
ends 2017 at about 6 percent.  With long-run inflation expectations  assumed to remain 
well anchored and the margin of slack in labor and product markets diminishing, 
consumer price inflation edges up gradually bu t is still only 1¾ perc ent in 2017.  Late in 
the decade, the economy converges to an unemployment rate near the long-run NAIRU, 
an inflation rate at the Co mmittee’s longer-term objective, and a nominal federal funds 
rate of 4¼ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
We estimate that foreign  GDP growth moderated to an annual rate of 2¼ percent  
in the second quarter, as activity decelerated in emerging market economies  (EMEs) and 
contracted in Europe.  In the near term, fi scal retrenchment and financial stresses are 
expected to remain a substantial drag on GDP growth  in Europe, while activity elsewhere 
should expand at a moderate pace.  We assume  that euro -area leaders take actions 
sufficient to allow  financial tensions related to the euro- area crisis  to start to ease by next 
year.  This reduction in financial stresses, in conjunction with supportive monetary  policy 
around the world, should pave the way for a pickup in foreign GDP growth from 
2¼ percent in the second half of 2012 to 3¼ percent by  2014.  Compared with the June 
Tealbook, this outlook is just a bit weaker in the current quarter and little changed 
thereafter.  
Despite a flurry of announcements by European policymakers, f inancial stresses 
in Europe have worsened si nce the June Tealbook.  M arket participants reacted positively 
to a cut in policy rates by the European Central Bank (ECB) and welcomed pledges by 
European leaders to establish a single supervisory mechanism for banks and to allow the 
European Stability Me chanism ( ESM ) to recapitalize banks  directly .  However, this  
positive response was short  lived , as investors came to recognize that European 
policymakers must still overcome major hurdles to address their fiscal- and banking-sector vulnerabilities .  Sovereign spreads climbed appreciably in Italy and Spain , and 
European bank stocks plunged.  Accordingly , we continue to expect financial conditions 
in Europe to deteriorate further over the course of this year until policymakers are  forced 
to take more -decisiv e policy actions, eventually  lead ing to gradual financial and 
economic improvement.  However , as discussed in the Risks and Uncertainty section, the 
possibility  of more- dire outcomes remains significant.  
Foreign inflation slowed from 2 .6 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter to 
an estimated 2 percent  pace in the second quarter, primarily reflecting declines  in retail 
energy prices .  Inflation is expected to pick up in the current quarter, as oil prices have 
firmed of late  and agricultural  commodity prices ha ve jumped because of  droughts in 
North America  and elsewhere.  With commodity prices projected to level off over the 
next couple of years and economic slack  widening slightly , we continue to expect foreign 
inflation to remain contained  through the forecast period .

  In response to the slowing in output growth and inflation  over the first half of the 
year, many  central banks eased the stance of monetary policy during the intermeeting 
period.  Notably, the ECB, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), and t he Central Bank of 
Brazil cut  their  policy rates, while the Bank of England (BOE) expanded its quantitative 
easing program and launched a new facility to support lending to the nonfinancial sector.  
We expect foreign central banks to take further accommoda tive actions  in coming 
quarters . 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Recent indicators suggest that GDP growth in advanced foreign economies  
(AFEs ) slowed from 1.5 percent in the first quarter to around ¾ percent in the second 
quarter, a little weaker than in the J une Tealbook, as U.K. GDP contracted much more 
sharply than anticipated.  W e expect AFE growth to remain near  that anemic pace in the 
second half of this year.  Despite agreement among European leaders to move forward on a number of fronts to address the c risis, we assume that financial tensions in the euro area 
will increase in coming months , leading to a deepening of the euro- area recession.  Par tly 
reflecting spillovers from the euro -area downturn, output growth in the other major AFEs 
should remain modest.  A s the euro -area recession abates and global economic conditions 
slowly improve, GDP growth in the AFEs should pick up to 1¼ percent  in 2013 and 
reach 2  percent in 2014, about unchanged from the June Tealbook. 
Headline inflation in the AFEs stepped do wn from 2 .2 percent in the first quarter 
to less than ¾ percent in the second quarter.  This decline is ¾ percentage point greater than we had anticipated, mostly  reflecting a surprisingly large fall in retail energy prices 
in Canada.  AFE inflation should average 1¼  percent through the end of 2013 before 
edging up to 1½ percent in 2014.  Recent increases in energy prices prompted us to raise our inflation forecast a little for the second half of this year relative to the June Tealbook.  Our projection for inflation is mostly unchanged thereafter.  Amid subdued inflation prospects and sizable output gaps, we expect AFE central banks to ease further in the second half of this year. 
Euro Area 
Our projection for economic activity in the euro area is little chan ged relative to 
the June Tealbook.  Recent indicators suggest that euro- area real GDP contracted at an 
annual rate of about 1 percent in the second quarter.  Industrial production and retail sales  
remain well below their first -quarter level s despite an inc rease in May , and the

  unemployment rate reached a record -high 11.1 percent  in May.  In June, confidence 
indicators edged down and the composite PMI stayed firmly in contractionary territory; 
flash estimates for July point to continued weakness  in the current quarter.  We expect 
GDP to fall at a 1½  percent rate in the second half of the year and ¼ percent in 2013 
before increasing only 1 percent in 2014. 
Euro -area inflation moderated to an annual rate of about 2 percent in the second 
quarter from 2.6 percent  in the first quarter, largely as a result of  earlier declines in  
energy prices.  We expect inflation to remain around 2 percent in the second half of this 
year—a little higher than in the June Tealbook—r eflecting recent euro depreciation and 
higher energy  prices.  Thereafter, we project that inflation will edge down to 1½ percent 
in 2013 and 2014.  At its July 5 meeting, the ECB cut its benchmark policy rate to 0.75 percent and reduced the rate on its overnight deposit facility to zero.  ( We examine 
the effect  of the deposit rate cut on money market functioning in the box “The Effects of 
the European Central Bank’s Deposit Rate Cut” in the Financial Developments section.)  We expect the ECB to lower its benchmark policy rate to 0.5 percent in the fourth qua rter 
and to continue to provide significant liquidity to banks. 
European leaders announced new plans to address the crisis at their June 28–29 
summit, including some steps toward a banking union.  During the intermeeting period, policymakers also approved a loan package of up to €100 billion to shore up the Spanish banking sector and allowed Spain more time to bring its deficit down.  ( For further 
details , see the box “Recent Developments in the Euro Area.”)  Investor enthusiasm was 
short lived, however, as it became clear that many of the agreed -upon measures still face 
daunting technical, legal, and political challenges.  Moreover, progress on the strengthening of Europe’s financial rescue facilities has flagged, with German approval of the ESM on hold pending a ruling by the German Constitutional Court scheduled for mid-September.  Thus, Europe still lacks a firewall sufficient to protect vulnerable 
countries from possible adverse shocks, such as a breakdown of negotiations between the newly elected Greek government and its official creditors over a resumption of EU– IMF 
financing.  Amid these ongoing uncertainties, we expect a further deterioration in financial conditions, which will eventually force policymakers to take actions aggressive 
enough to stabilize the situation and ultimately restore investor confidence.

 Recent Developments  in the Euro Area 
Over the intermeeting  period, euro‐area leaders announced  several measures  
designed  to increase regional  financial integration  and enhance  support for 
vulnerable  economies,  particularly  Spain.  Despite these announcements,  
financial stresses in the euro area have  worsened  (see the figures on the 
following  page), as critical details of the plans have yet to be worked out, 
implementation  is expected  to be time consuming  and contentious,  and further 
policy measures  will likely  be needed.        
 
At their June 28–29 summit,  European  leaders announced  plans for deeper 
economic  and financial integration.   First, they agreed to establish a single bank  
supervisory  mechanism  involving  the ECB.  The European Commission  intends to 
present specific proposals  in September, and  European  leaders plan to consider  
them by the end of the year.  Second,  leaders agreed that when such a 
supervisory  mechanism  is established, the  European  Stability Mechanism  (ESM) 
will be able to directly  recapitalize  banks rather than channel assistance through 
governments.   These steps are in line with a proposal  by a few key regional  
officials for the euro  area  to move toward a banking  union (including  a pan‐
European  approach  to deposit  insurance  and bank resolution)  and a fiscal union 
(including  issuance  of common  debt and greater constraints  on national fiscal 
policies).   Although  European  leaders did not endorse this proposal,  they invited 
its authors to further develop it  and to present another  report in October.  
 In addition,  euro‐area policymakers  announced  measures  to assist vulnerable  
economies.  They  agreed to extend  from 2013 to 2014 the  deadline for Spain  to 
bring its fiscal deficit below 3 percent  of GDP.  They also worked out key terms of  
Spain’s financial assistance package  (to fund the recapitalization  of its banks), 
which include plans for comprehensive assessments  of bank capital needs, 
transfers  of impaired  bank assets to an  external asset management  company,  
and the imposition  of losses on shareholders  and some junior creditors  of banks.  
The loans provided  to Spain in the package  will not have explicit  seniority  vis‐à‐vis 
private claims and thus may avoid further constraining  Spain’s ability to issue 
new debt.  Euro ‐area policymakers  also announced  that the government  of 
Cyprus had formally requested  financial assistance from  euro‐area  governments  
and the IMF.   Much of this assistance will likely  be devoted to the recapitalization  
and restructuring  of Cypriot banks, which are  heavily exposed to Greece.   Finally, 
euro‐area member  states agreed to a €120  billion (1.3 percent  of euro‐area GDP)  
growth package,  which includes an increase  in the capital of the European  
Investment Bank, reallocation  of EU funds toward growth‐enhancing  projects,  
and credit enhancements  for infrastructure bonds. 
 Although  these measures  are positive developments,  critical details remain 
unsettled  and implementation  risks are substantial.   It remains unclear how 
supervisory  authority  will be allocated  between the  ECB—the  presumptive 
pan‐European  supervisor—and  national financial supervisors.   Further, following  
the summit, statements  by some policymakers  created confusion  as to whether

direct recapitalization  by the ESM would actually absolve individual  sovereigns  of 
the cost of recapitalizing  banks in their jurisdictions.   As a related  matter, some 
market participants  believed  that, once the single supervisory mechanism  and 
the ESM’s authority  to directly  recapitalize  banks were both in place, the loans to 
Spain’s government  to finance  recapitalization  would be replaced  by direct 
equity stakes in its banks.   However, subsequent  statements  by euro‐area 
policymakers  have raised doubts regarding  these expectations.   
 An additional  concern is that the process of strengthening  the financial 
backstops  for vulnerable  governments  has met with  delays.  In  particular,  the 
establishment  of the ESM, which is intended  to supplement and  supplant the  
resources  of the temporary  European  Financial  Stability Facility (EFSF), is  falling 
behind schedule.   The original  target of  July will not be met, as legal challenges  
will delay  Germany’s  ratification  of the ESM treaty until mid‐ September  or later.  
As a result, with claims  on EFSF resources  growing (including  financial assistance 
for Spanish banks  and Cyprus), the financial backstops  will remain  inadequate  in 
the near term for a wide  range of  adverse scenarios.   
 Greece remains  a potential  trigger of  such scenarios.  After  prevailing  over the  
far‐left anti‐bailout party, SYRIZA,  in national parliamentary  elections  on June 17, 
the center‐right New Democracy  party formed a pro‐bailout coalition with a 
strong parliamentary  majority.   The new  coalition  government  is now 
cooperating  with its official creditors  in an effort  to keep Greece in the euro area.  
However, Greece’s  adjustment  program  is substantially  off track,  and the Greek 
government  cannot receive additional  program  funds until it agrees with its 
creditors  on a strategy to restore  credibility.   Such a strategy  will likely  require 
very unpopular  policy commitments  by the Greek government  (including  
additional  fiscal austerity  measures  worth at least  5 percent of GDP).  In addition,  
Greece’s creditors  will likely  have to commit  additional  financing,  debt relief, or  
both.  Negotiations  are likely to be difficult, and  the timing is tight.  About 
€3 billion of Greek government  bonds held primarily  by the Eurosystem  will 
mature on August 20.  Even if  a makeshift  solution to this immediate problem  is 
found, Greece’s  official creditors  will likely have  to decide  by September  whether 
to augment  or to suspend  Greece’s  program.

  United Kingdom  
The U.K. economy shrank  2.8 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter 
according to the preliminary estimate , marking the third consecutive quarterly decline.  
This estimate is substantially lower than in the June Tealbook owing in part to a 
surprisingly sharp drop in construction.  The contraction in GDP was exacerbated by a special holiday to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.  Although the Summer 
Olympics in London should temporarily boost activity in the third quarter, low 
confidence, aggressive fiscal consolidation, and negative spillovers from the euro area are expected to weigh on the underlying pace of economic activity.  After contracting ¼ percent in 2012, economic activity should rise at a pace of 1¾ percent in 2013 and 
2½ percent  in 2014, supported by accommodative monetary policy and the diminution of 
financial stresses in Europe. 
U.K. i nflation slowed to 1 percent in the second quarter  from 2.1 percent in the 
first quarter  amid ample spare capacity and weak wage growth .  We expect these factors 
to keep inflation just below 1¾ percent  on average in 2013 and 2014.  With output falling 
and inflation moderating , the BOE announced a £50 billion expansion of its quant itative 
easing program to £375 billion (almost 25  percent of GDP).  In addition, the BOE 
released details of a new Funding for Lending Scheme that will provide banks with long-term funds at below- market rates to encourage them to lend to the nonfinancial s ector .  
(See the box “The Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme ” in the Financial 
Developments section .) 
Japan 
The outlook for Japan is little changed relative to the June Tealbook.  We estimate 
that real GDP growth slowed from 4 .7 percent in the first quarter to 2¼ percent in the 
second quarter, primarily reflecting reduced support from fiscal stimulus measures.  In 
addition, recent  data point to reduced momentum, with the composite PMI falling into 
contractionary territory in June.  Accordingly, we expect GDP growth to slow to a 
modest ¾ percent pace in the second half of the year.  As the global recovery gradually gains momentum, we forecast  GDP growth to pick up to 1 percent in 2013 and to nearly 
1½ percent in 2014. 
We estimate that Japanese inflation turned negative again last quarter.  Consumer 
prices should continue to decline at a slow pace through the end of 2013 before rising 1 percent in 2014 because of  a planned 3  percentage point hike in the consumption tax.

  Earlier this month, the Bank of Japan slightly altered the composition of its Asset 
Purchase Program but left its size unchanged.  Amid ample resource slack and below-
target inflation, we continue to anticipate a further easing of monetary policy going forward.  
Canada 
We estimate that real GDP grew 2  percent in the second quarter, the same rate as 
in the first quarter.   Recent data are consistent with our view that the Canadian economy 
will continue to expand at a moderate pace in the near term.  In June, the manufacturing PMI ticked up to a solid 54.8 and employment edged up following outsized gains in the spring.  The latest Business Outlook Survey by the Bank of Canada (BOC) indicate s that 
businesses have remained optimistic about sales, investment, and hiring over the coming year.  As in the June Tealbook, we project that Canadian GDP will continue to expand at a 2 percent pace through the end of 2013 and then accelerate to a 2½ percent rate in 2014 
as global GDP growth rises. 
Consumer price inflation fell to zero  in the second quarte r, 1¾ percentage points 
below our projection in June , as Canadian retail energy prices fell sharply .  With retail 
energy prices having bottomed out, we expect inflation to rebound to 1¾ percent in the second half of 2012 and stay close to that pace thereaf ter.  With low inflation and with 
global headwinds res training Canadian GDP growth, we continue to expect the B OC to 
keep its target for the overnight rate at 1  percent until the second quarter of 2014. 
EMERGING MARKET  ECONOMIES  
We estimate that GDP growth  in the EMEs slowed to 4 percent in the second 
quarter, down from 5 .2 percent  in the first quarter.  As expected, activity decelerated in 
most countries, reflect ing in part the passing of factors that had boosted output in the first 
quarter, notably the bounceback  from last year’s flooding in Thailand.  However,  the tone 
of recent data w as somewhat weaker than anticipated .  For China, although second-
quarter real GDP growth came in as expected, the first -quarter reading was revised down 
significantly.  Acco rdingly, and consistent with the lower path for U.S. GDP growth, we 
marked down EME growth a touch in the near  term . 
The outlook for activity in the EMEs further out is little changed.  After holding at 
a bit below trend for the next several quarters, output growth should edge up to about 4½ percent  by 2014, as economic activity in the advanced economies firms and as

  policymakers in the EMEs pursue more -accommodative policies.   A significant 
deterioration of the situation in Europe and a sharp slowing of the U.S. economy are key 
downside risks to EME growth.  In addition, we remain attentive to the risk of a sharp slowdown in China, perhaps triggered by a collapse in the property market.  (See the scenario “Hard Landing in China” in the Risks and Uncertainty section.) 
Headline inflation in the EMEs remained at 3  percent in the second quarter , with 
declines in most countries largely offset by a nearly 20  percent spike in inflation in India .  
We project  EME inflation to hold near 3 percent before picking up to 3¼ percent by the 
end of the forecast period , as GDP growth strengthens.  This outlook is similar to that in 
the June Tealbook.  With inflation and economic growth moderating, some countries, including Brazil, China, and Korea, have recently loosened monet ary policy.  
China  
Real GDP expanded at an annual rate of 7½  percent  in the second quarter , up 
from a downwardly revised pace of 6 .6 percent in the first quarter.  D ata were weak 
across all sectors of econo mic activity in April.  However, retail sales, inve stment, and 
bank lending accelerated  late in the quarter, partly in response to policy easing, 
suggesting a stabilization of domestic demand growth after several months of softening.  
China’s trade surplus widened in the second quarter, reflecting a small increase in exports and a decline in imports.  For the second half of this year, we see Chinese real GDP growth remaining relatively subdued by historical standards at 7¾  percent .  Output 
growth should then gradually strengthen  to a rate of 8¼ percent  by the end of 2014, 
reflecting policy stimulus and an improvement in global demand.  Nonetheless, a hard landing in China remains a nonnegligible risk. 
Chinese consumer price inflation fell sharply in June, reflecting a large drop in 
domestic food prices following a run- up earlier in the year .  For the second quarter as 
whole, inflation was 2½ percent  at an annual rate.  The drop in food prices led us to lower 
our estimate of current -quarter inflation ½  percentage point, to 1¾ percent .  With food 
price inflatio n expected to normalize, headline inflation is projected to be 2½ percent in 
the fourth quarter before edging up to 3 percent by 2014 as economic activity accelerates and wage growth remains strong.  Amid contained inflation and concern about GDP growth,  the PBOC cut banks’ one-year lending and deposit rates in early July to 6 percent  
and 3 percent , respectively, the second cut in these rates in the past two months.  We  
assume additional monetary and fiscal accommodation in the coming quarters.

  Other Emerging Asia  
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, data suggest that GDP growth slowed from 
5.5 percent in the first quarter to 3½ percent in the second quarter.  We  had anticipated  
that economic activity in the region would moderate after the rebound from the 
widespread  supply disruptions following last year’s floods in Thailand.  However, the 
incoming data have been weaker than we had expected.  In Singapore, the advance 
release indicates that real GDP fell unexpectedly in the second quarter.  For other 
economies in the region, indicators such as industrial production, PMIs, and exports were 
soft.  These data and the lower path of U.S. output growth  in the near term  led us to mark 
down a bit our forecast for the region in the second half of this year to 4 percent .  
There after, the outlook is unchanged, with growth averaging 4¼ percent in 2013 and 
4½ percent in 2014. 
We estimate that inflation in the region increased to an annual rate of 4¼ percent 
in the second quarter, largely driven by an outsized rise in  inflation in I ndia, where a 
recent sharp depreciation of the rupee passed through to consumer prices.  We expect 
inflation to moderate in coming quarters to about 3 percent  and then to stay near that rate 
for the remainder of the forecast period.  In Korea, w ith the bal ance of concerns shifting 
from inflation to output growth, the central bank lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3 percent . 
Latin America 
In Mexico, recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth slowed to 2¾ percent  
in the second quarter, down from a robust 5.3 percent  in the first quarter .  The 
manufacturing PMI  in the second quarter stood below its first- quarter average, and retail 
sales, exports, and industrial production through May also point ed to a deceleration of 
activity .  These data, along with downward revisions to U.S. manufacturing production, 
led us to mark down Mexican GDP growth in the second quarter by ¼  percent age point.  
GDP growth is projected to increase slightly to about 3  percent over the remainder of the 
forecast period. 
For South America, real GDP growth is es timated to have dropped from 
3.2 percent in the first quarter to 2½ percent in the second quarter, largely reflecting a sharp deceleration of economic activity in Venezuela.  We project that growth in the region will ris e to nearly 4  percent by the end of 2014.  In Brazil, favorable data on 
consumption and an anticipated rebound in agricultural output (which had suffered a

  large weather -related contraction in the first quarter) suggest that GDP growth picked up 
to 2 percent in the second quarter from below 1 percent in the first  quarter .  This rebound 
is a bit smaller than estimated in the June Tealbook, as recent data on industrial 
production and exports have been disappointing .  We expect Brazilian growth to rise to 
about 4 percent by the end of 2014, supported by a firming of economic activity in the advanced economies and accommodative macroeconomic policies domestically .  The 
Brazilian central bank cut the Selic rate by 50  basis points to a historic low of 8 percent, 
bringing the cumulative policy rate reduction since last August to 450  basis points.  In 
addition, Brazilian authorities announced another round of fiscal stimulus in late June. 
Mexican inflation declined sharply to 2½ percent in the second quarter because of 
the implementation of electricity subsidies.  We expect that inflation will rebound to an annual rate of 4½  percent  in the current quarter , reflecting the unwinding of the effect of 
these subsidies and increases in food prices resulting from the ongoing drought in Mexico and the United States .  Mex ican inflation should then moderate to 3½ percent  over the 
remainder of the forecast period .  In Brazil, inflation continued to decline against the 
background of weak output growth, dipping to below 4 percent i n the second quarter.  
We project that Brazilian  inflation will rise gradually to 5½ percent  in 2014 as economic 
activity improves.

 Financial Developments 
Financial conditions registered mixed changes over the intermeeting period, 
reflecting several important influences, includi ng generally weaker-than-expected recent 
domestic economic data releases, concerns a bout the euro-area cris is and the outlook for 
global growth, actual and expected cha nges in U.S. monetary policy, and  
better-than-anticipated prof its at some S&P 500 firms.  On net over the period, the 
expected path of the federal funds rate sh ifted down moderately.  Yields on nominal 
Treasury securities decreased, reflecting th e lower expected federal funds rate, the 
continuation of the maturity extension program (MEP) throu gh the end of the year, rising 
expectations that the Federal Reserve will ea se monetary policy further, and increased 
safe-haven demands related to the euro-area cr isis.  Market-based measures of inflation 
compensation declined despite a rise in the prices of oil and agricultural commodities.  
Broad indexes of U.S. equity prices edged lower, on net, but spreads on investment- and 
speculative-grade corporate bonds  relative to comparable-maturity Treasury securities 
narrowed slightly.  Despite concerns about European developments, conditions in  short-term unsecured dollar funding market s remained stable over the intermeeting 
period.  
In foreign markets, sovereign yields generally declined over the period amid 
continued weak economic conditions, flight-to- safety flows, and monetary policy easing 
by several major central banks, including the ECB.  Yields on most euro-area peripheral 
sovereign debt were notable exceptions.  As  concerns over Spanish public finances and 
uncertainties over future steps to be taken by European policymakers mounted, the spread on Spanish 10-year bonds relative to German bunds rose to its highest level since the 
beginning of the euro-area debt crisis.  On  net, European benchmark equity prices 
decreased slightly while European bank equity  prices fell sharply.  The broad dollar index 
rose as the dollar appreciated near ly 5 percent against the euro.   
Domestic financing flows were re latively stable over the period.   
Investment-grade corporate bond issuance re mained robust in June and July, and 
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans contin ued to grow briskly.  Consumer credit 
expanded further in May.  Results from the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on 
Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicate that a modest fraction of banks, on net, eased lending standards over the past  three months, and demand fo r all major categories of

  loans strengthened somewhat (see appendix).  Those results are consistent with the 
modest growth in bank credit observed over that same period.  M2 has expanded at a 
solid pace of late, likely stemming from investors’ continued desi re to hold safe and 
liquid assets amid ongoing concerns about the euro-area and the globa l growth outlook.   
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
The expected path of the federal funds rate shifted down modestly and Treasury 
yields dropped to historic lows over the intermeeting period in response to generally 
weak domestic economic data, heighted conc erns about the euro area and the global 
growth outlook, and increased expectations th at the Federal Reserve will ease monetary 
policy further.  Overall, the June FOMC announcement was viewed as broadly in line 
with expectations.  However, the FOMC’s decision to continue th e MEP was reportedly a 
slightly more substantial easing move than some market participants had expected.   
As a result, the nominal Treasury yield curve flattened a bit on the announcement.1  
Subsequent FOMC communicati ons over this peri od, including the Chairman’s monetary 
policy testimony, elicited limited reactions  in financial markets.     
The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by OIS rates shifted down 
some and now first rises above the current target range in the third quarter of 2014, about 
two quarters later than at the time of the June FOMC meeting.  The modal federal funds rate path—the most likely values for future fe deral funds rates derived from interest rate 
caps—remains within the curren t target range through mid-2016.
2    
Results from the Open Market Desk’s late st survey of primary dealers showed a 
significant downward shift in dealers’ medi um-term policy rate expectations, with the 
median target federal funds rate forecasts  for the second half of 2014 through the second 
half of 2016 declining up to 50 basis points si nce the time of the June survey.  Dealers 
                                                 
1 Expectations regarding a continuation of the MEP likely moved longer-term Treasury yields 
lower before the extension was announced on June 20 .  Taking market expectations into account, the 
responses of Treasury yields to the announcement appeared to be broadly consistent with predictions from 
staff term structure models as described in Canlin Li and Min Wei (2011), “Term Structure Modeling with 
Supply Factors and an Application to Maturity Extension Program Evaluation,” memorandum, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Monetary Affairs, September 15; and Canlin Li and Min Wei (2012), “Term Structure Modeling with Treasury and Agency MBS Supply Factors,” memorandum, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Monetary Affairs,  January 18. 
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 16 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.

  now view the first quarter of 2015 as the most lik ely time of the first increase in the target 
rate, one quarter late r than in the June survey.  In  addition, dealers revised up the 
probability that the FOMC will announce additio nal asset purchases within the next year 
from 50 percent to 65 percent, but saw only a 25 percent probability that such an action 
will be announced at the August meeting.  Dealers also assigned higher odds to the 
Committee changing its forward guidance langu age or the Federal Reserve lowering the 
interest rate paid on excess re serves within the next year.  In response to a new survey 
question, dealers assigned a 30 percent probabil ity that a new tool would be used within 
the next year and a 40 percent probability th at one would be used within the next two 
years.  In their written co mmentary, dealers’ views on wh at form the new tools would 
take varied, though the most frequently cited was a program similar to the Bank of 
England’s Funding for Lending Scheme. 
On net over the intermeeting period, nomina l Treasury yields decreased and the 
yield curve flattened moderately, with 2-year  yields down 8 basis points and yields on 
10- to 30-year Treasury coupon securities lower by 20 to 27 ba sis points on net.  Market 
contacts reported that the decl ine in 2-year yields reflected in part growing expectations 
that the interest rate paid on reserve ba lances may be reduced in coming months, 
consistent with the ECB’s decision to  cut its deposit rate to zero.   
The staff’s term structure model attributed  about half of the drop in longer-term 
Treasury yields to lower real term premiums, likely due to continued investor demand for 
the relative safety and liquidity of Treasury securities amid persiste nt concerns about the 
euro-area crisis, as well as somewhat increased investor expectations for additional 
policy-easing actions by the FOMC.  A smalle r portion of the decline in long-term 
nominal Treasury yields app ears to have reflected lower inflation expectations and 
inflation risk premiums.  Consistent with th is view and despite an increase in commodity 
prices, TIPS-based inflation compensation ove r the next five years declined 15 basis 
points, while the TIPS-based five-year forwar d measure decreased 7 basis points, on net, 
over the intermeeting period.  Swaps- and caps- based measures of inflation compensation 
also fell, while survey-based measures of  expected inflation were about unchanged. 
The Desk’s outright purchases and sale s of Treasury securities under the MEP 
continued as planned and did not  appear to have any material  adverse effect on Treasury

  market functioning.3  Most measures of Treasury liqui dity conditions, including average 
trading volumes by primary dealers and the average fitting error from the staff’s nominal 
Treasury yield curve, were litt le changed over the period and st ayed close to their recent 
averages.  Bid–asked spreads were also about unchanged. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Financial stresses in the euro area have  intensified, despite some initial easing 
following the European summit in late June.  (See the box “Recent Developments in the 
Euro Area” in the International Economic De velopments and Outlook section in this 
Tealbook.)  Spreads on Spanish and Italian 10 -year bonds over German equivalents rose 
more than 80 basis points over the period, a nd the Spanish spread reached its highest 
level since the beginning of the euro-area debt crisis.  Amid this retreat from the 
periphery, the yields on 10-year sovereign bonds of Germany and the United Kingdom declined 30 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively.  In  addition, 2-year sovereign 
bonds of Germany and a few other European co untries traded at yields below zero after 
the ECB cut its policy rates by 25 basis points.  The main refinancing rate was lowered to 
75 basis points, and, surprising market partic ipants, the ECB’s depos it rate—which sets a 
floor under overnight interest rates—was lowe red to zero.  (See the box “The Effects of 
the European Central Bank’s Deposit Rate Cut.”)   
Several other foreign central banks ease d policy over the intermeeting period.   
In support of its fixed-exchange-rate regime  against the euro, Denmark’s central bank 
reacted by lowering its short-term deposit rate  to negative 20 basis points.  The Bank of 
England increased the size of its asset purch ase program by £50 billion to £375 billion.  
The bank also announced details on its ne w Funding for Lending Scheme, which is 
designed to boost bank lending to the nonfinan cial sector.  (See the box “The Bank of 
England’s Funding for Lending Scheme.”)  In response to slowing growth and moderating inflation, the central  banks of Brazil, China, and South Korea all reduced 
policy rates as well.     
                                                 
3 The Federal Reserve purchased $49 billion and sold or redeemed $61 billion of Treasury 
securities over the intermeeting period under the MEP;  the average maturity of SOMA Treasury holdings 
has lengthened by about three years since the beginning of the program last September.  In addition, the 
Federal Reserve reinvested $30 billion in agency MBS from principal payments on its holdings of agency 
securities.

  The euro depreciated sharply agains t the dollar following the ECB’s policy 
announcement and continued to fall as euro-area stresses intensified.  However, the broad 
nominal index for the dollar is up only modestly over th e intermeeting period, as the 
dollar’s moves against most other currencies  were small and generally offsetting.   
Headline equity price indexes in the adva nced foreign economies fluctuated over 
the period with euro-area developments but were little changed on net.  Although 
European equity prices rose following th e June 29 release of the euro-area summit 
statement, these gains were subsequently erased as investor sentiment regarding  
euro-area prospects soured again.  However, shares in euro-area banks, which are highly 
sensitive to any concerns about soverei gn conditions, decreased 14 percent over the 
period, in part reflecting the downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service of 9 European 
banks with global capital market operations, as well as an additional 28 Spanish banks.  Equity prices are down in many key emergi ng market economies on fears that their 
economic performance might be adversely a ffected by any further slowing in global 
growth, with prices in Braz il, China, and South Korea dow n more than 5 percent.   
Foreign official investors’  holdings of Treasury securi ties increased in May at 
about the pace seen since the beginning of the year.  More -recent data on custody 
holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of Ne w York indicate further foreign official 
purchases of Treasury securities in June and early July, but these pur chases were largely 
offset by sales of agency securities.  Fore ign private purchases of  Treasury securities 
strengthened in May. 
SHORT -TERM DOLLAR FUNDING MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  
Conditions in short-term unsecured dolla r funding markets remained stable over 
the intermeeting period, although most peripheral euro-area institutions continued to have 
little, if any, access to such markets.  The three-month euro–dollar implied basis swap 
spread—an indicator of dollar funding pre ssures faced by European banks—was down 
slightly on net.  The outstanding amount of central bank dollar liquidity swaps edged up $3 billion to $27 billion, reflect ing a small increase in foreign banks’ demand for dollar 
funding from the ECB.  LIBOR–OIS spreads were little changed.  While the scandal 
surrounding LIBOR intensified after Barclays settled charges brought by U.S. regulators, 
so far there have been no notable disruptions  in markets for securities based on LIBOR or 
in funding markets more generally.  In addi tion, the spread between the rates implied by

 The  Effects  of the European  Central Bank’s Deposit Rate Cut 
In response  to the ongoing euro‐area debt  crisis and mounting  downside  risks to 
euro‐area economic  growth, the European  Central Bank (ECB) cut its  key policy 
rates 25 basis points during the intermeeting  period.  The ECB’s main refinancing  
rate fell to ¾  percent,  and the interest rate the ECB pays on deposits  fell to zero.   
Short‐term market interest rates moved down in response  to the cuts, raising 
questions  about the viability of money market funds (MMFs) and the smooth 
operation of  securities  repurchase markets  and other short‐term  funding 
markets.    
Following  the ECB’s action, the overnight  interbank  interest rate  fell roughly 
20 basis points to just above one ‐tenth of a percent.   Short‐term interest rates on 
sovereign  securities  from core euro‐area countries  also fell noticeably  following  
the ECB’s cut.  Three‐month Treasury  bill rates, shown  in the lower‐ left figure on 
the following  page, fell into negative  territory  in Franc e and the Netherlands, 
while German rates, which  were already negative,  fell further.   More surprisingly,  
as shown in  the lower‐ right figure  on the following  page, two‐year bonds  in 
Germany  and the Netherlands  also traded at rates below zero. 
The ECB’s  rate cut also exerted downward  pressure  on short‐term  interest rates  
in neighboring  countries  that try to constrain  exchange  rate fluctuations  against 
the euro.  In Switzerland,  where the foreign exchange  value of the Swiss franc 
against the euro has stayed close to the Swiss National  Bank’s stated ceiling, two‐
year interest  rates have remained  quite negative.   The Danish central bank, which 
pegs its curre ncy to the euro, followed  the ECB’s cut by lowering  its key policy 
rates, including  reducing  the rate on one‐week certificates  of deposit (not 
shown) to negative  0.20 percent.    
 
Negative  short‐term  interest rates  do not appear to have disrupted  market 
functioning  in the euro area.  Trading volumes  in euro‐area overnight funding  
markets (not shown), which had  already been low  amid the abundance  of 
liquidity provided  by the ECB, have remained  at the low  end of their historical  
range.  Concerns  about an increase  in fails in repurchase markets, where  rates 
have also turned negative,  do not seem to have been borne out  as yet.  Althoug h 
they play a relatively  small  role in money markets, several  euro‐denominated  
MMFs have closed to new investments since the  ECB’s cuts, given the low rates 
of return they expect to earn on their holdings.    
The legal structure of  European  MMFs differs from that in the United States in 
ways that  may mitigate the effects of the ECB’s rate cut on that sector.  In  
particular,  most euro‐denominated  funds are less restricted  than U.S. funds in 
the classes of assets they can hold, and  some of the funds redeem shares at

variable, rather  than fixed, net  asset values.  As  a result, at least  some of these 
funds may be able to hold assets of slightly lower quality  or longer duration  that 
continue to offer positive returns, and some funds may also have greater 
flexibility  in accepting  negative  rates.  Although  these funds  can continue  to 
operate, the low interest rate environment  is likely to reduce  their profit margins 
and require adjustments  to their investment  strategies. 
Past experiences  in advanced  foreign economies  have shown that  activity in 
money markets declined  in low interest rate environments,  although  this 
damping effect does not appear to have been perman ent.  During periods of 
zero interest rates in Japan, activity in uncollateralized  money markets was 
essentially  nonexistent.   Activity in money markets quickly recovered,  however,  
once the Bank of Japan raised its policy rate above zero,  even though the 
interest rate  never rose  above 50 basis  points.   
In Switzerland  and Sweden, the  effect of very low  interest rates was even less 
severe.  In 2003, Switzerland  experienced  a period of very low  overnight interest 
rates.  Trading  volumes  in overnight markets  declined,  but there  were no other 
noticeable  effects.  During a period of low interest rates between July 2009  and 
July 2010, the  central bank of Sweden, the  Riksbank,  charged banks 25 basis 
points to place funds  in its overnight deposit  facility.  The Riksbank  kept its 
deposit rate below zero  during that period to maintain  a meaningful  opportunity  
cost for the use  of its facility.  In Sweden’s  case, the negative rate on  central bank 
deposits had only a modest  effect on money markets.   
In all, the ECB’s rate cuts  successfully  lowered euro‐area short‐term  interest 
rates.  The policy  action is intended  to ease financial conditions  and, hence,  to 
boost lending  and economic  activity.  While it is possible some adverse effects in 
financial markets may  develop, if short‐term  interest rates stay at these levels for 
an extended  period of time, past experience  suggests  such effects  may quickly 
reverse once rates begin to increase.

 The  Bank of England’s  Funding for Lending Scheme 
In June, the governor  of the Bank  of England and the chancellor  of the 
Exchequer  announced  plans to introduce  a temporary  Funding for Lending  
Scheme (FLS) that would reduce banks’ funding  costs and encourage  bank 
lending to U.K. households  and firms.  Details were released  in July, and the new 
measure is expected  to be operational  in August.  Its success will de pend in part 
on how much it actually reduces banks’  funding costs and on whether funding  
costs are in fact impeding  new lending. 
Under the FLS, the  Bank of England (BOE) will stand  ready to lend U.K. Treasury  
bills to banks  participating  in the scheme.  Bank s will be able to initiate  requests  
for such loans  during a “drawdown  period” that runs from August 2012 through 
January 2014, and  the loans can have  a maturity of up to four years.  The bills  
borrowed  by the banks can be used as high‐quality collateral to obtain funding  at 
low interest rates in private securitized  lending markets.   This method of 
providing  liquidity assistance,  which is also used in the BOE’s Discount  Window 
Facility, is designed  to leave the overall level of bank reserves  unchanged.  
Although  the scheme was announced  jointly by the BOE and the U.K. Treasury, 
the Treasury  is not indemnifying  the Bank against losses incurred under the FLS.  
Rather, the BOE will rely on the collateral  provided  by banks as security against 
the loan  of the Treasury bills.   A wide range of  collateral  will be acceptable,  
including  the banks’ loans  to businesses  and households, and  subst antial haircuts 
will be imposed  on illiquid collateral.    
The scale of borrowing  under the FLS could be large.  Participating  banks are 
given an initial borrowing  allowance  equal to 5 percent  of their loans to the U.K. 
nonfinancial  sector as of June 30, 2012.   If that allowance were  fully utilized, 
borrowing  under the FLS would amount to about £80 billion,  more than 
5 percent  of U.K. nominal  GDP.  Furthermore,  the borrowing  allowance  for any 
bank will increase pound ‐for‐pound  with net lending in excess of the end‐of‐June 
amount.  There is no upper limit on the  size of individual or  aggregate borrowing  
under the scheme.  Amounts  borrowed  and lent under the scheme by each 
participating  institution  will be made public by the Bank of England on a quarterly  
basis. 
To help stimulate lending,  the cost of using the FLS for a participating  bank is 
designed  to vary inversely  with  its lending to the U.K. nonfinancial  sector.  As  
shown in  the lower‐ left figure on the following  page, banks that maintain  or 
increase net  lending over the  period from June 30, 2012,  to the end of 2013 will 
pay a fee of 0.25 percent per annum on the amount of Treasury  bills borrowed;  
banks with declines  in net lending over that  period will pay an extra

0.25 percentage  points for each percentage  point decline, up to a  maximum  fee 
of 1.50 percent on the amount  borrowed.   The overall  cost of funding a new loan 
under the program  is this fee plus the cost of obtaining  private‐market funding  
secured by Treasury bills.   Based on a secured  funding rate that is  close to the  
BOE’s Bank Rate, currently  at 0.50 percent,  the cost of funding a four‐year loan 
for a bank  that is expanding  its lending coul d be as low as 0.75 percent.   (See the 
sterling repo rates shown in  the lower‐ right figure below.)   
The FLS is premised  on the view that loan growth has been restrained  by high 
bank funding costs.  In its May Inflation Report , the BOE estimated  the marginal  
funding cost of extending  variable‐rate sterling  loans (such as mortgages  with 
rates that move with the BOE’s Bank Rate ) to be about 3½ percent on average 
across banks in April.  If this estimate is  accurate,  then banks may well see 
borrowing  via the FLS as very attractive, and  participation  in the scheme  could be 
high.  However,  lenders with greater  access to low‐cost retail deposits  may have 
substantially  lower costs  than those  more reliant on  the wholesale  market for 
term funding and would be less likely  to participate.     
Even if bank participation  is high, the impetus to lending  provided  by the FLS 
could be low if factors other than bank funding costs are impeding  loan growth  
in the United Kingdom.  High  risk aversion,  concerns  about bank capital, and 
uncertainty  over new supervisory  standards  could be important  in restraining  
banks’ willingness  to make new loans.  In  addition,  dim prospects  for economic  
activity could be limiting the demand for new loans.  If such factors  are 
important,  the FLS may not induce a pickup  in lending.  However, even  flat 
lending activity could be judged positive ly if lending would have declined  in the 
absence of  the program.

  the three-month forward rate agreement and the OIS rate three to  six months ahead—a 
forward-looking measure of potential f unding pressures—edged down on net.   
Outstanding unsecured commercial paper (CP) issued by financial institutions 
with European parents increas ed slightly, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Even 
so, the average maturity of unsecured financia l CP issued by institutions with European 
parents remained lower than that for institutions with U.S. parents. 
In secured funding markets, Treasury ge neral collateral fina nce repo (GCF repo) 
rates fluctuated some but were roughly unchanged on balance.  Movements in the 
Treasury GCF repo rate over the period were a ttributed to a variety of factors, most 
notably changes in the level of net settlement of Treas ury securities and GSE cash 
balances.  The intermeeting period saw the intr oduction of a futures c ontract tied to the 
DTCC Treasury GCF Repo Index (a volume-weighted average of interdealer Treasury 
GCF repo trades published by the Depository Tr ust & Clearing Corporation), and initial 
interest on the part of  investors was notable.4 
In the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market, amounts outstanding 
remained stable for programs with sponsors domiciled in both the United States and Europe.  Overnight spreads on ABCP with U.S. and European sponsors were roughly 
unchanged.  The pace at which money market funds were reducing their exposures to 
Europe has apparently picked up somewhat ove r the period, with the direct exposures of 
U.S. money market funds to Europe falli ng 13 percent in June.  However, those 
exposures remain sizable at $688 billion, including $290 billion in euro-zone holdings, 
dominated by French, German, and Dutch issuers.       
Investors remained wary of large banking institutions ove r the intermeeting 
period.  Moody’s downgraded Bank of Ameri ca, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan 
Chase, and Morgan Stanley.  However, these downgrades had been widely expected and 
elicited little response in fina ncial markets.  While most large-bank earnings reports were 
broadly in line with market expectations , investors noted some weakness in trading 
                                                 
4 Trading in futures on the Treasury GCF repo index has been robust since the contracts were 
launched in mid-July, with open interest on contr acts settling through the end of the year growing to 
roughly 9,500 contracts.  For comparison, open interest on Eurodollar futures contracts maturing through 
the end of the year currently stands  at about 1,958,625 contracts.  The aggregate notional dollar value on 
repo futures contracts has already reached about 2.4 percent of the aggregate notional value for the widely traded Eurodollar futures contracts.  Futures on the Treasury GCF repo index are traded on NYSE Liffe

  revenues, and expenses due to litigation and mortgage putbacks by the GSEs also 
weighed on earnings.  In addition, concerns a bout the situation in Europe continued to 
damp sentiment toward these institutions.  Consequently, stock prices for most large 
domestic bank holding companies fell over the period, with some declining more than  
10 percent, and CDS for those firms moved hi gher.  By contrast, large regional banks’ 
share prices edged up, as sec ond-quarter earnings results generally beat expectations on 
strong mortgage banking performance and improved credit quality.  
The mean quarterly return for the hedge fund industry was negative 2.6 percent in 
the second quarter, about on par with the S&P 500 return over the same period.  In spite 
of the negative performance, there was a net capital inflow of  $4.1 billion over this 
period.  Inflows were concentrated at the i ndustry’s largest firms, while smaller funds 
experienced net redemptions.  The use of leverage remained low across funds. 
OTHER DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad equity price indexes edged lower,  on net, over the intermeeting period, as 
share prices were buffeted by developments  in Europe, worrisome domestic economic 
data reports, and the first wave of corpor ate earnings reports for the second quarter, 
which were, on balance, not as gloomy as ha d been feared.  The staff’s estimate of the 
spread between the expected real return on equity among S&P 500 firms and the real  
10-year Treasury yield—a rough gauge of th e equity premium—was little changed over 
the intermeeting period and remained very  wide by historic al standards.   
Options-implied one-month-ahead volatility on the S&P 500 index, as measured 
by the VIX index, increased slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period but remained in 
the lower portion of its range over the past five  years.  Staff analysis suggests that the 
recent level of the VIX is somewhat low conditional on other measures of 
macroeconomic uncertainty.  However, options-implied volatility 12 months ahead, while 
also about unchanged for the in termeeting period, is somewhat less depressed relative to 
historical norms, suggesting that market pa rticipants are less sa nguine about risks to 
equity market performance over the medium term.      
On balance, second-quarter ea rnings reports appear to have been less weak than 
market participants anticipated, though expect ations were set quite low; the reaction of 
share prices to earnings reports has been, on the whole, positive.  Earnings from the 
roughly one-third of S&P 500 firms that have reported for the second quarter, together

  with Wall Street analysts’ for ecasts for the remaining firms, suggest that aggregate profits 
for the nonfinancial sector likely fell slight ly on a quarterly basis, while those for the 
financial sector experienced a more pronounced  decline.  Wall Street analysts revised 
down their forecasts of year-ahead earni ngs for S&P 500 firms notably over the  
four-week period ending in mid-July. 
Yields on investment- and speculative-gra de corporate bonds fell further over the 
intermeeting period, approaching record lows.  The spread of yields on corporate bonds 
over those on comparable-maturity Treasury secu rities also narrowed slightly, on net, but 
remained somewhat elevated relative to averag e levels prior to the financial crisis.  The 
spreads of yields on A2/P2 unsecured CP i ssued by nonfinancial firms over yields on 
A1/P1-rated issues were a bout flat, on balance, over the intermeeting period.   
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Available indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to 
be quite solid as firms generally maintained strong balance sheets.  The aggregate ratio of 
debt to assets was stable at a relatively low level in the first quarter, and the liquid asset 
ratio remained near its highest level in more  than 20 years.  In the second quarter, the 
volume of nonfinancial corporate bonds upgraded by Moody’s exceeded the volume of 
bonds downgraded yet again.  The six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial 
firms remained low in June.  The expected ye ar-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms 
from the Moody’s KMV model was unchanged in June and July; it remained slightly 
elevated by historical standard s, reflecting relatively depre ssed equity prices, which the 
model translates into low corporate asset values. 
Overall, the rate of issuan ce of debt by financial and nonfinancial firms remained 
strong over the intermeeting period.  Bond issu ance by nonfinancial firms, particularly 
those with investment-grade ratings, was robus t late in the second quarter and continued 
to be strong in July.  Many issuers reported intending to use the proceeds to pay down 
other debt or to finance acquisitions.  Bond issuance by financial firms has also been 
robust.  The volume of nonfin ancial CP outstanding rose ea rly in the second quarter but 
decreased slightly in June, reflecting weak issu ance across most indus tries.  The volume 
of C&I loans outstanding increased notably  over the intermeeting period.  In the 
syndicated leveraged loan market, institutional issuance remained solid in the second 
quarter, supported by continued strong interest on the part of traditionally unleveraged 
investors such as pension funds and insurance companies.  Based on conversations with

  market participants, terms and structures of new leveraged loan deals have loosened 
modestly on the margin. 
Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was anemic in June and July.  
The near freeze in the IPO market reporte dly reflected in part the poor post-IPO 
performance of Facebook share prices, as  well as pronounced volatility in global 
financial markets associated with heightened  concerns about the euro area.  The most 
recent data on share repurchases and stoc k-financed mergers by nonfinancial firms 
indicated that equity retireme nts overall remained robust in the first quarter, leaving net 
equity issuance deeply negative for that quarter.  Announcements of mergers and new 
share repurchase programs suggested that equity  retirements likely remained strong in the 
second quarter. 
Financial conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) market remained 
somewhat strained against a backdrop of w eak fundamentals and still-tight underwriting.  
Prices for CRE properties, on balance, were  stable at low levels, while vacancy and 
delinquency rates stayed elevat ed.  Results from the July  SLOOS indicate that lending 
standards for major categories of CRE loans remain tighter than the midpoint of their 
range since 2005 at a large number of banks de spite a modest net fraction that reported 
having eased standards on such loans over the past few surveys.  That said, larger fractions of banks reported st ronger demand for CRE loans, on net, in the July SLOOS 
than in the previous survey.  In additi on, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed 
securities rose noticeably in the second quarter, and, according to market reports, 
issuance for the remainder of the ye ar is expected to be solid.   
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Mortgage rates declined fu rther during the intermeeting period, with the interest 
rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages falling to around 3½ percent.  Despite 
new historical lows for mortgage rates, while  refinancing continued to increase, activity 
remained muted relative to what sta ff models would have  predicted based on 
fundamentals.  This muted refinancing is br oadly consistent with evidence from the  
July SLOOS indicating that mortgage underwri ting standards at banks generally have not 
eased much from their tightest post-crisis levels, even for prime conforming loans.  
Mortgage refinancing through HARP—perh aps accounting for around one-third of 
overall refinancing activity in recent mont hs—apparently continued to tick up, but 
activity related to the program appears to have  varied widely across mortgage servicers, 
Financial Developments

  with some respondents in the SLOOS reporti ng that capacity constraints were limiting 
their participation in the HARP.  The sp read between agency MBS and the 10-year 
Treasury yield narrowed somewhat over the in termeeting period.  (For information about 
the so-called GSE keepwell agreements with the Treasury Department, see the 
accompanying box “GSE ‘Keepwell’ Agreements with the U.S. Treasury.”) 
Changes in residential mortgage credit quality appear somewhat mixed.  House 
prices continue to increase, and the increase s are reaching a larger share of metropolitan 
areas.  The CoreLogic house pr ice index climbed for a fift h consecutive month in May, 
leaving the index 4 percent higher than its low in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Seventy 
percent of metropolitan areas experienced a three-month price increase of more than 1 
percent, the highest share si nce early 2006.  Even with thes e increases in house prices, 
however, around one-fourth of mortgage borrowers are estimated to  remain underwater 
on their loans.  Although the rate at which mortgages are entering delinquency has been 
trending down—likely reflecting the tight und erwriting that has been in place for a few 
years—the fraction of existing mortgages th at are seriously delinquent remains very 
elevated.   
Consumer credit continued to expand briskly in recent months.  Nonrevolving 
credit grew at a robust pace in May, owi ng to both rapid growth in student loans 
originated by the federal government and, to a lesser extent, auto loans made by private 
lenders.   Revolving credit also rose in Ma y but was merely 1.6 percent higher than its 
level a year before.  Delinquency rates for c onsumer credit remained low, especially for 
revolving credit, largely reflecting a compositiona l shift of credit supply over the past few 
years toward the least-risky borrowers.  The rate of issuance of c onsumer ABS picked up 
appreciably in June, making total issuance in the second quarter the highest since the end 
of the TALF, and issuance has remained robust in July.   
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Since the June FOMC m eeting, the Treasury has auctioned $200 billion in 
nominal securities and $22 billion in 10- and 30-year TIPS.  The auctions were generally 
well received, with bid-to-cover ratios mostly above, and indire ct bidding ratios close to, 
their recent averages. 
Despite continued significant fiscal pre ssures facing state and local governments, 
gross long-term issuance of m unicipal bonds was robust in June  and thus far in July.

  Net issuance of long-term bonds turned positive in the second quart er after staying in 
negative territory for more than a year.  Ratings downgrades of municipal bonds by 
Moody’s continued to substantially outp ace upgrades in the first quarter, and  
higher-frequency data on ratings changes suggest that this trend continued in the second 
quarter.   
In June and July, three cities in Californ ia voted to file for bankruptcy.  Two of 
the cities attributed the filing mainly to sharply declining tax reve nue due to the housing 
downturn and growing costs of public employee pensions and salaries; these cities 
reportedly have a total of around $600 milli on in bonds outstanding.  Despite these 
events, in general default rates on municipal bonds remained very low.  Market 
participants reportedly do not expect the practice of bankrupt cy filing by municipalities to 
spread widely.  As a result, the municipal bond market showed little reaction to the news, 
and yields on long-term general obligation municipal bonds generally followed Treasury 
yields lower over the intermeeting period.  CDS spreads for states were roughly 
unchanged on net.  
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit grew modestly in June and in the second quarter more broadly, 
though at a slightly slower pace than in the first quarter.   The slowdown reflected a 
significant step-down in the growth of securities during the second half of the quarter, 
while growth of loans remained modest over the past three months.  C&I loans continued 
their brisk expansion in recent months, primarily  due to strength at large domestic banks.  
In contrast, CRE loans and home equity loans declined in June at rates broadly in line 
with recent experience.  Closed-end mortga ges rose, on balance, in the second quarter, 
the fourth consecutive quarter of modest growth in this category.  The drop in this 
measure in June reportedly reflected substantial sales to the GSEs that more than offset a 
pickup in originations.  Consumer loans incr eased modestly during the quarter as tepid 
growth in credit card balances was augmente d by a somewhat stronge r expansion in other 
consumer loans.  Noncore loans grew at a fast er pace in May and June than earlier in the 
year, boosting overall second-quarter loan grow th, as reverse repos at large banks rose 
rapidly and the category for other loans and leases accelerated at domestic banks.  The 
slower growth in securities in May and J une was accounted for primarily by decreases in 
non–U.S. government securities as well as re ductions in agency MBS at a few large 
domestic banks.

 GSE “Keepwell”  Agreements  with the U.S. Treasury  
When Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac entered conservatorship  in August 
2008, the U.S. Treasury  agreed to provide  up to $100 billion  in capital 
support to each agency  to maintain positive net worth as part of the 
Senior Preferred Stock  Purchase Agreements.   In February  2009, the 
capital support levels  were increased  to $200 billion  for each agen cy.  
Then in December  2009, these “keepwell” agreements  were amended  to 
provide unlimited  capital support from  2010 through the end of 2012.  
Through the  first quarter of 2012, the GSEs have drawn a combined  
$187 billion from the U.S. Treasury. 
After 2012, the limit for capital  support for each GSE  will revert  to 
$200 billion,  less the capital drawn during 2008 and  2009.  Essentially,  the 
effect of the amendment  to provide unlimited  suppor t for the period  
between 2010 and  2012 was to raise the cap by the amount of the draws 
during those years,  which amounted  to more than $60 billion.  As a 
result, Fannie  Mae will still have  $125 billion in availabl e capital support 
and Freddie Mac will have  $149 billion ($274 billion combined) at the  end 
of this year.  The expiration  date for unlimited  support is not expected  to 
be postponed  by the Congress.1 
In October 2011, the  Federal Housing  Finance Agency (FHFA) provided  
projections  of capital draws through 2014 for each of  the GSEs under 
several house  price scenarios  and found that the GSEs are not likely to 
approach their  capital support limits  even under an adverse  scenario.   In 
its baseline scenario,  in which house prices were assumed  to decline  
modestly  through mid‐ 2012 and to increase  thereafte r, the GSEs were 
expected  to draw an additional  $8 billion in 2013 and 2014 (combined).   
Under the FHFA’s  adverse scenario,  in which house prices were assumed  
to fall more  than 15 percent by mid‐ 2012 and to increase  thereafter,  the 
GSEs were expected  to draw an additional  $28 billion in capital support in  
2013 and 2014, leaving  a combined  $246 billion of unused support    
                                                 
1 As part of their ongoing strategic  planning,  the Federal  Housing Finance 
Agency  announced  on July 23, 2012, that it will hire a consultant  to develop a 
receivership  plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after the keepwell  agreements 
expire.

available.   By comparison,  the most recent Comprehensive  Capital 
Analysis and Review (CCAR)  supervisory  stress scenario  included  house 
price declines of 8 percent from the first quarter of 2011 through mid‐
2012 (much of  which was data by the time of the CCAR), an additional  
decline of 15 percent through early 2014, and  only a slight improvement 
toward the end of 2014.  Under the CCAR supervisory  stress scenario,  
GSE capital draws could be substantially  higher than in the FHFA’s 
adverse scenario  and place the GSEs  closer to their limits.   
Since the FHFA made  its projections,  the GSEs’ earnings  profiles have 
improved  markedly,  suggesting that these projections  might well 
overstate the  likely draws in those scenarios.  In  the first quarter of 2012, 
Fannie Mae posted positive earnings,  thereby avoiding  a capital draw.  In  
addition, Freddie Mac requested  only $19 million in capital support that 
quarter.  Smaller‐ than‐expected  single‐family  portfolio  losses have 
supported  these improved  earnings.   Moreover,  the better outlooks for 
house prices and mortgage  delinquencies  in recent months have further 
improved  agency earnings  prospects.  That said, the  mandatory  
10 percent  dividend  payments  to the U.S.  Treasury  continue  to weigh on  
agency earnings.  
To date, market participants do  not appear concerned  about the 
expiration  of unlimited  capital support for the GSEs  argu ably because the 
remaining  capital support is  large relative to the agencies’  cumulative 
draws of capital from  2008 through  early this year.  However, a 
significant  deterioration  in the housing sector beyond that considered  by 
the FHFA could  lead investors  to focus more attenti on on the risk that 
the GSEs could require Treasury  support beyond  the remaining  amounts  
available to them.   In that event, the prices of GSE debt and MBS could 
be significantly  affected.

  According to the July SLOOS, modest net fractions of domestic banks, on 
balance, reported having eased their lending standards further over the past three months 
for most categories of loans, while relatively large net fr actions reported stronger demand 
for many types of loans.  In particular, a m odest fraction of domestic banks reported that 
C&I loan standards for large and middle-market firms had eased, on net, and large 
fractions continued to report th at the spread of rates on such  loans over their bank’s cost 
of funds had decreased.  However, significantly smaller fractions of domestic respondents, on average, reporte d stronger demand for C&I loans than had done so in the 
previous survey.  According to a set of annual questions asked in the July SLOOS, 
lending standards on C&I loans have returned to  about the middle of the range that those 
standards have occupied since 2005, but for all other major loan categories, banks 
continued to report that their credit standa rds remained at least somewhat tighter, on 
balance, than the middle of their re spective ranges over that same period. 
M2 advanced at an annual rate of 6¼ per cent, on average, in June and July.  The 
level of M2 remained elevated relative to what would be expected  based on historical 
relationships with nominal income and opportun ity costs.  The elevated level is likely 
related to investors’ con tinued desire to hold safe and liquid assets amid ongoing 
concerns about the European crisis and the global growth  outlook.  Liquid deposits, the 
largest component of M2, increased at an a nnual rate of 9½ percent, largely because of 
another sizable shift of deposits from offshor e bank branches to onshore entities.  These 
funds likely accounted for an uptick in the amount of noninterest-bearing deposits that 
currently receive unlimited FDIC insurance.
5  
Currency grew at a rate slightly above its historical average in June and July, 
while retail money funds and small time deposits continued to decline.  The monetary 
base rose as reserve balances  and currency expanded over the period.  The increase in 
reserve balances was driven in large part  by fluctuations in the Treasury’s general 
account, movements in which are typically  volatile.  (See the box “Balance Sheet 
Developments over the Intermeeting Period.”) 
                                                 
5 Offshore deposits have been included in the FDIC’s assessment base since April 2011, negating 
some of the benefits to banks of booking these depos its abroad.  The staff estima tes that this most recent 
shift of deposits boosted M2 growth by 2.1 percentage points, on average, over June and July. 
The Dodd–Frank Act provides temporary, unlimited deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-
bearing transaction accounts in excess of $250,000 from December 31, 2010, through December 31, 2012.  
These deposits are estimated to have grown nearly 50  percent from December 31 , 2010, and currently make 
up about 15 percent of M2 or about $1.5 trillion.

Treasury securities  with remaining  maturities  of 6 to 30 years and sold or allowed 
to mature  without reinvestment $61  billion in Treasury  securities  with maturities  
of 3 years or less.1  Since the maturity  extension  program  was announced  last 
September, the  average maturity  of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury holdings  has 
risen from 6.1 years to 9.1 years.  In addition,  the Desk reinvested  $30 billion of 
agency debt and agency MBS principal  payments  in agency MBS securities.2   
Foreign central bank liquidity swaps increased  $3 billion to $27 billion, reflecting  
an increase in  draws by the European  Central Bank  (ECB).   Following  the ECB’s 
cut in its deposit rate, market rates on euro‐denominated  repo transactions  
against the safest collateral  turned negative,  and the Desk placed euro‐
denominated  funds in the Exchange  Stabilization  Fund and System Open Market 
Account on deposit at official  institutions rather  than invest in repos at negative  
rates.  The ne t portfolio holdings  of Maiden Lane  III LLC and Maiden Lane  LLC 
decreased  $6 billion and $1 billion, respectively, because of  asset sales.  Proceeds  
from asset sales from Maiden Lane  III portfolios  enabled the repayment of  the 
remaining  equity contribution  by American International  Group, Inc.   Proceeds  
from asset sales from the Maiden Lane  portfolio ena bled the repayment of  the 
remaining  balances  of the loans extended  by JPMorgan  Chase & Co.  Loans 
outstanding  under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities  Loan Facility  (TALF) were 
slightly lower.   On June 28, 2012, the Federal Reserve Board announced  that it 
agreed with the Treasury  Department  that it was appropriate to reduce  from 
$4 billion to $1 billion the credit protection that  Treasury  is providing  for TALF.  To  
date, TALF has experienced  no losses, and the Board continues  to see it as highly 
unlikely that any recourse  to the Treasury  protection  will be necessary.

Appendix 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), 
modest fractions of domestic banks, on balance, continued to report having eased their lending 
standards across most loan typ es over the past three months.1  In addition, relatively large 
fractions reported stronger demand for many typ es of loans over that period.  Staff models 
suggest that the amount of easing reported was about in line with what would be expected after accounting for a number of bank-specific factors and several key macroeconomic variables over 
the survey period.  In contrast, reflecting th e continued financial strains in Europe, lending 
standards at branches and agencies of foreign banks continued to tighten for commercial and 
industrial (C&I) loans and were unchanged for commercial real estate (CRE) loans; demand for both types of loans reportedly weakened, on net, at those institutions.  The July survey also 
contained a number of special questions on lending to, and competition from, European banks.  In 
addition, the survey asked about the revised Ho me Affordable Refinance Program (HARP 2.0) 
and repeated a set of special questions from a year  ago on the current level of standards relative to 
their range since 2005 for a broad variety of loan categories.  
Bank lending policies for C&I loans at domestic  banks generally eased over the past three 
months, though mostly for large and middle-ma rket firms.  Although a modest fraction of 
domestic banks reported having eased standards on C& I loans to those firms, standards on loans 
to small firms were little changed on balance.
2  In addition, domestic banks continued to ease 
many terms on C&I loans to all types of firms, though the net proportion of banks doing so was generally smaller than that in the April survey .  Loan demand from large and middle-market firms 
strengthened somewhat further over the past three months, on net, but the increase was much less 
widespread than indicated in the April survey.  Meanwhile, lo an demand from small firms was 
unchanged, on balance, over this period.   
The July SLOOS also indicated that strains in the European financial system continued to 
affect business lending activity in the United Stat es.  About one-third of domestic banks and 
                                                 
1 The July 2012 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses 
and households over the past three months.  This appendix is based on responses from 64 domestic banks 
and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  As part of the recent renewal of the SLOOS,  
7 domestic banks have been added to the previous sample of banks.  These additions did not materially 
change the net fraction of banks responding to a particular question.  Respondent banks received the survey 
on or after July 3, 2012, and responses were due by July 17, 2012.   
For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction of 
banks that reported having tightened standards minus the fraction of banks that reported having eased standards.  For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fractions of banks that reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand.   
2 Large and middle-market firms  are generally defined as firms with annual sales of $50 million or 
more and small firms  as those with annual sales of less than $50 million.

  two-thirds of foreign banks reported that they ex tend credit to banks headquartered in Europe or 
their affiliates or subsidiaries.  Large fractions of these institutions indicated that they had 
tightened standards on such loans over the past three months—fractions that were significantly 
higher than those in the April survey.  For the third consecutive survey , a sizable fraction of 
domestic banks, weighted by C&I loans, reported that their business had increased due to 
decreased competition from European banks.  Furthe rmore, a very large majority of domestic 
banks reported that they remain willing to accommodate business in the second half of 2012 
arising from decreased European competition.   
Lending conditions for CRE loans at domestic banks also reportedly continued to ease 
from very tight levels.  A modest fraction of such  banks, on balance, repor ted that they had eased 
standards over the past three months, while a relatively sizable fraction, on net, continued to indicate that demand for such loans had strengthe ned.  In light of the responses to special 
questions on the level of standards for different types of CRE loans, the easing reported in recent surveys likely reflects changes in standards for loans secured by multifamily real estate and to a 
lesser extent by nonfarm, nonresidential properties.   
Meanwhile, lending standards over the past three months were little changed for prime 
mortgages, and tightened somewhat for nontraditional mortgages on net.  However, a relatively large fraction of respondents reported having ex perienced stronger demand for prime mortgages 
over the past three months, likely related to a pickup in refinancing activity. 
Responses to the set of special questions on HARP 2.0 indicate that a majority of large 
mortgage lenders are participating in the program , though many smaller banks are not.  Weighted 
by closed-end residential mortgages held on bank s’ books, the majority of respondents that are 
participating reported that the proportion of HAR P refinance applications relative to total 
refinance applications had been significant over the past three months.  An even larger majority 
indicated that they anticipate that more than 60 percent of HARP appli cations will be approved 
and successfully completed.  More than one-half of  domestic banks, on a we ighted basis, reported 
that capacity constraints were limiting the numbe r of HARP applications that they could process 
and that they were restricting their participation in the program to those mortgages that are 
already serviced or held by their banks. 
Lending conditions for consumer loans repor tedly eased over the past three months.  
Domestic banks indicated that standards on au to loans had eased moderately, while those on 
credit card loans had eased modestly on net.  St andards on other consumer loans remained little 
changed.  In addition, small net fractions of banks reported increased demand for credit card and 
other consumer loans, while a relatively large fr action of banks reported an increase in demand 
for auto loans. 
A final set of special questions, which were al so asked in the July 2011 survey, prompted 
banks to assess their current lending standards re lative to the middle of the range that those 
standards have occupied since 2005.  On a portfolio-weighted basis, lending standards on C&I

  loans at domestic banks reportedly have almost fully  returned to about the middle of that range.  
However, credit standards for all other categories of loans remained at least somewhat tighter, on 
balance, than the middle of their respective ranges over the same period.  In particular, across all 
residential mortgage categories, including prim e conforming loans, the majority of banks 
indicated that their standards are currently either  significantly tighter than the middle of the range 
or still at the tightest level that standards have been since 2005. 
LENDING TO BUSINESSES  
Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending 
A modest fraction of domestic banks conti nued to report having eased standards on C&I 
loans to large and middle-market firms; standard s on loans to small firms were little changed, on 
balance, for the third consecutive survey.  As in  the previous survey, no domestic bank indicated 
having tightened standards on loans to either type of firm.  In contrast, a small number of U.S. 
branches and agencies of foreign banks reported having tightened their standards on C&I loans 
for the fourth consecutive quarter.  Consistent w ith the ongoing strains in the European financial 
system, the few foreign respondents that repor ted having tightened over this period were 
predominantly subsidiaries of European banks. 
Domestic banks continued to ease many terms on C&I loans, on balance, to all types of 
firms, though the proportion of banks doing so was generally smaller than that in the April survey.  One exception was the cost of cred it lines, for which relatively more respondents 
reported having eased their lending terms over the past  three months.  In addition, relatively large 
fractions of respondents continued to indicate th at they had narrowed the spreads on C&I loan 
rates over their cost of funds and had reduced their use of interest rate floors.  However, when the 
responses for loans to small firms are weighted  by the volume of small C&I loans on banks’ 
books (a proxy for the amount of lending to sm all businesses), the responses suggest that declines 
in the spreads on such loans have not been as widespread as indicated by the unweighted 
responses.  The weighted responses are more cons istent with the stubbornly elevated spreads for 
smaller C&I loans still observed in the Survey of Terms of Business Lending.  Foreign banks, on the other hand, reported little change in most C& I lending terms over the past three months, with 
the exception of the cost of cr edit lines, the maximum size of credit lines, and premiums charged 
on riskier loans, for which terms have tightened slightly on net. 
Almost all domestic banks that reported ha ving eased standards or terms on C&I loans 
continued to cite more-aggressive competition fro m other banks and nonbank lenders as a reason.  
Only about one-fourth of the banks that had eased lending policies had done so because of a more 
favorable or less uncertain economic outlook, and few banks cited any of the other reasons listed 
in the survey.  Meanwhile, large majorities of the few banks, both domestic and foreign, that 
reported having tightened C&I credit standards or te rms cited a less favorable or more uncertain 
economic outlook as a reason.

  A significantly smaller fraction of banks than  in the previous survey reported stronger 
demand for C&I loans over the past three months.  Only a modest fraction of domestic banks 
indicated that the demand for C&I loans by large and middle-market firms had been stronger, on balance, while demand for loans by small firm s was unchanged.  However, weighted by C&I 
loans outstanding, a moderate fraction of banks, on balance, reported increased demand for loans 
to large and middle-market firms, more consistent with the strong growth in aggregate outstanding C&I loans in the H.8 bank credit data .  On net, domestic banks also continued to 
report a rise in the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers regarding new or 
increased credit lines.  In contrast, demand fo r C&I loans at foreign banks reportedly had 
weakened somewhat further for the second consecutive survey. 
A large majority of banks that reported st ronger demand for C&I loans cited increases in 
customers’ funding needs related to inventories and accounts receivable, mergers and acquisitions, and investment in plant or equipment as important factors underlying the increase.  At the same time, at least three-fourths of the domestic and foreign banks indicating that demand 
had decreased reported that a decrease in investment in plant or equipment was an important 
factor. 
Special Questions on Lending to and Competition from European Banks 
The July survey asked a set of special questions about lending to, and competition from, 
banks headquartered in Europe a nd their affiliates and subsidiaries (regardless of the location of 
the affiliates or subsidiaries).  Many of these ques tions were also asked in the previous three 
surveys.  The survey responses continued to show  that while strains in the European financial 
system are affecting the distribution of busin ess lending activity in th e United States, overall 
credit availability has not been noticeably reduced. 
A large fraction of both domestic and foreign banks that extend credit to European banks 
had tightened standards on such loans over the past three months—a fraction that was 
significantly higher than that in  the April survey.  Loan demand by European banks at both 
domestic and foreign banks, howev er, was little changed on net.  
Weighted by C&I loans, about one-half of domestic banks that compete with European 
banks continued to report that business has increased due to decreased  competition from such 
banks.  Furthermore, a very large majority of  domestic respondents reported that they were 
willing to accommodate additional business in th e second half of 2012 arising from decreased 
European competition.  In weighted terms, sligh tly less than one-half of the domestic banks that 
experienced increases in C&I loans over the first half of this year indicated that either a moderate or a small portion of that increase had been a ttributable to purchases of loans from European 
banks. 
Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending 
Lending conditions for CRE loans at domestic banks also re portedly continued to ease.  
A modest fraction of domestic banks, on balance, reported having eased standards on CRE loans

  over the past three months, while a relatively sizable fraction, on net, continued to indicate having 
experienced stronger demand for such loans.  However, weighted responses to the special 
question on the current level of standards relative to their recent range on specific CRE loan categories (discussed in greater detail below) s uggest that lending standards on construction and 
land development loans, in particular, have actually tightened somewhat since last year, 
suggesting that the thaw in CRE lending standard s seen in recent surveys likely has been limited 
to other CRE loan categories.  In addition, fore ign survey respondents, which held a relatively 
minor share of the outstanding CRE loans held in the U.S. banking sector, indicated that 
standards on such loans were unchanged for the sec ond straight survey and that demand had been 
noticeably weaker, on net, over the past three months. 
LENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS  
Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending 
Standards for residential real estate loans rema ined very tight despite some brighter news 
in the housing sector recently.  Domestic banks continued to report little change in lending 
standards for prime mortgages and having ti ghtened standards somewhat for nontraditional 
mortgages over the past three months on net.   Meanwhile, a relatively large fraction of 
respondents reported having experienced stronge r demand for prime mortgages over the same 
time period on balance.  Some of the stronger de mand may have been attributable to recently 
heightened refinancing activity, even though banks  were specifically asked to consider only new 
originations and not to consider refinances in the survey.  A relatively large fraction of banks also 
reported stronger demand for nontraditional mortgages, though one very large bank reported that 
demand had been weaker in that segment. 
In contrast, lending conditions for home equi ty lines of credit (HELOCs) remained stable.  
Changes in both lending standards and demand for such loans were relatively muted over the past three months. 
 Special Questions on the Revised Home Affordable Refinance Program 
 The July survey also contained special questions related to HARP 2.0.  Although only 
about one-half of respondents reported particip ating significantly in HARP, those banks held 
most of the mortgage loans on the ba lance sheets of the banks surveyed. 
Weighting the individual responses by outsta nding closed-end mortgage  balances held on 
those banks’ books, the majority of respondents re ported that the proportion of HARP refinance 
applications relative to total refinance applica tions had been between 30 and 70 percent over the 
past three months.3  An even larger majority indicated th at they anticipate that more than  
                                                 
3 None of the aggregated responses for the HARP special questions change materially whether we 
weight responses by a broader measure of total mortgage exposure, calculated by adding agency MBS 
holdings to outstanding closed-end mortgage loans, or by a measure of total mortgage origination activity, 
calculated by summing outstanding closed-end mortgage loans and outstanding balances of residential

  60 percent of HARP applications will be approve d and successfully completed.  More than  
one-half of domestic banks, on a weighted basis, reported that capacity constraints at their bank 
were either the most important factor or a very important factor limiting the number of HARP 
applications that they could process.  Similar fra ctions indicated that their bank had decided to 
restrict its participation in HARP to those mortgages that it already serviced or held.  Many banks also reported that credit overlays that they ha d imposed on top of the HARP requirements were 
somewhat important factors in limiting their participation—nearly one-half of all respondents, on a weighted basis, reported being unwilling to offe r HARP refinance loans to some customers with 
high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios or with low FICO scores. 
Questions on Consumer Lending 
Moderate fractions of domestic  banks reported that standard s on auto loans had eased, on 
net, while somewhat smaller net fractions indicat ed that standards on credit card loans had eased.  
Standards on other consumer loans remained little changed.  Banks again reported having 
narrowed spreads on auto loans, while other term s across the three categories of consumer loans 
remained relatively little changed on net. 
The fraction of respondents that indicated that  they were more willing to make consumer 
installment loans now as opposed to three months a go remained elevated by historical standards, 
for the second consecutive survey. 
Demand for all types of consumer loans stre ngthened on net.  A relatively large fraction 
of banks reported stronger demand for auto loans,  on balance, while only modest net fractions of 
banks reported stronger demand for credit card loans and for other consumer loans.  However, the 
share of banks that indicated that they had experienced higher demand decreased a bit, on net, for 
all three loan categories rela tive to the previous survey. 
Special Questions on the Levels of Lendi ng Standards Relative to Longer-Term 
Norms 
The July survey repeated a set of special qu estions from July 2011 that asked respondents 
to describe the current level of lending standards at their bank, rather than changes in standards 
over the survey period.4  Banks were asked to consider the range over which standards have 
varied between 2005 and the presen t and to report where standards reside relative to the midpoint 
of that range.  With the exception of standard s on C&I loans at domestic  banks, banks continued 
to report, on balance, that their credit standard s remained at least somewhat tighter than the 
middle of the range.  Still, consistent with the modest easing of standards, on average, that was 
                                                                                                                                                 
mortgage loans sold.  The latter measure includes mortgages sold to the GSEs, with servicing retained or 
with recourse or other seller-provided credit enhancements.   
4 The description of the results in this section is based on responses weighted by the outstanding 
loans in the respective loan category.  Results based on unweighted responses can be materially different, 
especially when a limited number of large banks dominate a particular lending market and the remainder of the banks respond to related questions in a different manner from those large banks.

  reported across most categories of loans in the quar terly surveys over the past year, the levels of 
standards at domestic banks were generally not quite as tight as in July 2011. 
A majority of domestic banks reported that lending standards on four different categories 
of C&I loans (investment-grade and noninvestment-grade syndicated loans, other loans to large 
firms, and loans to small firms) were about at the middle of the range that those standards have 
occupied since 2005.  That result appears to be consistent with the robust aggregate growth in C&I loans since 2011.  However, the fraction of fo reign banks that indicated that the levels of 
standards on large C&I loans were tighter than the middle of the range was somewhat higher than 
that of domestic banks.
5 
A significant net fraction of domestic banks repor ted that the current level of standards on 
all types of CRE loans (construction and land de velopment loans; loans secured by nonfarm, 
nonresidential structures; and loans secured by multif amily structures) is tighter than the middle 
of the range that those standards have occupied  since 2005.  Moreover, the net fraction of banks 
that reported that lending standards for constr uction and land development loans were at least 
somewhat tighter than the midpoint of their ra nge since 2005 increased, on net, relative to when 
the same set of questions was asked in July 2011.   In contrast, both for loans secured by nonfarm, 
nonresidential properties and for lending supported by multifamily properties, a number of large 
banks shifted their response from “significantly tighter” to “somewhat tighter” than the midpoint of their respective ranges, suggesting that conditi ons in those markets had eased to some extent 
over the past year. 
The levels of lending standards appear to be relatively little changed, on balance, since 
July 2011 for all four categories of residential mortgage loans included in the survey (prime 
conforming mortgages, prime jumbo mortgages, nontraditional mortgages, and HELOCs).  As 
was the case in last year’s survey, almost all banks reported that standards are still at least 
somewhat tighter than the middle of the range that  those standards have occupied since 2005.  For 
prime conforming loans and for prime jumbo loans, the fraction of banks indicating that standards were the tightest they had been since 2005 fell somewhat, but the fraction reporting that standards were significantly tighter than the midpoint of the recent range increased by a larger amount, 
suggesting little change in  overall conditions on net. 
With respect to consumer loans, large fractions  of domestic banks continued to report that 
lending standards were tighter than the middle of the range that those standards have occupied 
since 2005 for prime credit card, subprime credit card, auto, and othe r consumer loans.  However, 
the fractions of respondents that reported that standards on these loan categories were 
significantly tighter fell noticeably, while the fractions reporting that standards were only 
somewhat tighter rose since last year, suggesting some easing of overall standards on net. 
                                                 
5 As only a limited number of foreign respondents reported on the level of standards on loans to 
small firms and CRE loans, we do not report those responses here.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline pr ojection using simulations of staff models.  The first two 
scenarios consider opposing risks to domestic demand—the downside risk associated 
with the fiscal cliff at the beginning of next  year and the upside ri sk that the underlying 
pace of the recovery is more robust than th e recent economic news seems to suggest.   
The next two scenarios focus on opposing risks to  inflation—the possibility that we have 
underestimated the extent of labor market damage that has occurred, implying greater upward pressure on prices in coming years, a nd the chance that the stability of various 
measures of expected inflat ion turns out to be misleading us about the potential for 
disinflation.  The final two scenarios cons ider risks to the U.S. economic outlook 
associated with developments abroad.  In the first, a much more severe fiscal and financial crisis in Europe spills over to th e United States and th e rest of the global 
economy; in the second, a substantial deceler ation in economic activity in China and 
other Asian countries slows the p ace of the U.S. recovery.     
We generate the first four scenarios us ing the FRB/US model and the last two 
scenarios using the multicountry SIGMA model.   For the simulations with the FRB/US 
model, we use the same estimated monetary policy rule that gove rns the path of the 
federal funds rate in the base line.  For the simulations with  the SIGMA model, we use a 
generally similar policy rule that employs an alternative concept of  resource utilization.
1  
In all of the scenarios, th e size and composition of the SO MA portfolio are assumed to 
follow their baseline paths.  In this Tealbook we are including two new exhibits, 
“Alternative Projecti ons” and “Assessment of Key Macr oeconomic Risks.”  (See the box 
“New Exhibits in the Risks and Uncertainty Se ction” and the related exhibits at the end 
of this section.)  
                                                 
1 In particular, in the simulations using the FRB/US model, the federal funds rate follows the 
estimated outcome-based rule described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.  In the simulations 
using SIGMA, the policy rule is broadly similar but uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between 
actual output and the model’s estimate of the level of  output that would occur in the absence of slow 
adjustment of wages and prices.

  Fiscal Cliff 
Our baseline projection assumes that most federal tax provisions that are nearing 
expiration—including the tax cuts initially enacted in 2001 and 2003, relief for most 
taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax, and a number of other non-stimulus-related 
tax reductions—will eventually be extended.2  In contrast, this scenario assumes that all 
of these tax provisions are allowed to expire  next year, thereby increasing total tax 
payments from households and businesses by about 2½ percent of  GDP relative to 
baseline.  The automatic spending cuts requir ed by the sequestration associated with the 
Budget Control Act of 2011 take full effect in 2013, further restraining federal purchases 
by about ¼ percent of GDP relative to baseline.3  In addition, these fiscal policy 
developments are assumed to weigh on consum er and business confidence by more than 
in the baseline.  As a result, real GDP e xpands only 1 percent in 2013 and 2½ percent in 
2014, on average 1 percentage point per year  slower than in the baseline.  The 
unemployment rate rises to 8¾ percent in 2014.4  With a wider margin of slack in both 
labor and product markets, inflation declin es to 1¼ percent by 2015, and the federal 
funds rate does not begin to increase fr om its effective lower bound until early 2016.   
Faster Recovery 
This scenario assumes that both the staff and financial market participants have 
underestimated the future pace of the economic recovery, in part because 
seasonal-adjustment distortions and other factors have obs cured the underlying strength 
of the real economy.  In particular, both bus iness investment and consumer outlays on 
durable goods rise faster than expected, as  firms and households work to bring the  
still-depressed levels of these capital stocks closer to their longer-r un trends.  In addition, 
                                                 
2 As described in “Key Background Factors” of the Domestic Economic Developments and 
Outlook section, the staff’s baseline forecast assu mes that the temporary payroll tax cut and the EUC 
program will expire at the beginning of next year, that federal discretionary spending will be restrained by 
the caps set in the Budget Control Act and by reductions in defense spending as overseas military 
operations draw down, and that more -gradual deficit-reduction policie s will replace the automatic spending 
sequestration.  These policy assumptions in the baseline account for almost one-half of the deficit reduction 
associated with the full effect of the policies related to the entire fiscal cliff.  
3 After 2014, both tax rates and government sp ending gradually return to their baseline 
trajectories, leading eventually to budget deficits that  are about the same as in the baseline.  However, 
because those deficits follow a period of greater fiscal  restraint, the ratio of go vernment debt to GDP is 
lower over the longer term in the alternative scenario. 
4 Although taxes increase by more than 2 percen t of GDP in 2013 in the alternative scenario 
relative to the baseline, the initial negative effect on real GDP next year is smaller as households in the 
FRB/US model adjust their spending gradually in response to the decline in their disposable income; 
accordingly, real GDP growth in 2014 is also restrained.

  the greater-than-expected increases in house pr ices seen since the beginning of the year 
turn out to signal that a significant headwind fo r the recovery is abating more rapidly than 
anticipated, with favorable implications for construction, household wealth, and the 
willingness of financial institutions to extend credit.  In this environment, investor 
sentiment recovers more quickly, leading to a faster decline in risk premiums, and hence lower borrowing costs and higher wealth.  These f actors, in turn, contribute to a cycle of 
increased confidence, employment, credit av ailability, and spending that boosts the pace 
of the recovery further.  Real GDP accelerat es to an average annual growth rate of  
3¾ percent in 2013 and 2014, bringing the unemployment rate down to 6½ percent by the 
end of 2014.  Upward pressure on inflation is in itially tempered by the effects of stronger 
capital investment on labor productivity a nd unit labor costs.  Over time, however, 
greater resource utilization cause s inflation to move above baseline to a level consistent 
with long-run inflation expect ations (which remain well anchored) and the Committee’s 
longer-run objective.  In response to the st ronger pace of real activ ity, the federal funds 
rate begins to rise from its effec tive lower bound in the first half of 2013. 
Damaged Labor Market 
The unusual depth and breadth of the downt urn may have impaired the efficiency 
of labor markets and boosted th e NAIRU by more than estimated in the baseline.  In this 
scenario, we assume that the NAIRU reached 7 percent in early 2011 (1 percentage point 
above baseline) and that it will remain at this level for the indefinite future.  Furthermore, 
the trend labor force participation rate is assumed to decline further and is 1 percentage 
point below baseline by 2015.  These condi tions imply lower long-run levels of 
household income and corporate earnings; as  a result, underlying aggregate demand is 
weaker, and the unemployment rate barely inches down over the next few years.  
Nonetheless, labor market slack remains persiste ntly narrower in this scenario than in the 
baseline because of the higher NAIRU, im plying higher unit labor costs and greater 
upward pressure on consumer prices.  These price pressures are magnified by policymakers’ initial failure to recognize th e weaker supply-side conditions, which leads 
them to maintain a more accommodative stance of monetary policy than they would have 
chosen with a more accurate assessment of th e supply side.  As a result, the public’s  
long-run inflation expectations move up a nd actual inflation gradually rises to  
2½ percent.  In response to these more inflationary condi tions, the federal funds rate

  Disinflation 
The stability of various measures of e xpected inflation may be misleading us 
about the potential for further disinflation, pa rticularly in the context of the baseline 
assessment that considerable margins of sl ack in labor and product markets will persist 
for some time.  In this scen ario, both expected and actual inflation drift down over time, 
with headline inflation falling to about ½ perc ent by 2014; such declines would be in line 
with the predictions of some accelerationist Phillips curve models.  Real interest rates are 
higher, reflecting both lower inflation in c onjunction with the eff ective zero lower bound 
and higher bond premiums resulting from investors’ concern about the durability of the 
recovery.  The higher real inte rest rates restrain aggregat e spending modestly and raise 
unemployment relative to baseline.  The federa l funds rate remains at  its effective lower 
bound until late 2016. 
European Crisis with  Severe Spillovers  
In this scenario, the current stress in European financial markets intensifies further 
and causes Europe to plunge into a severe fi nancial crisis and a deep recession.  This 
outcome could result from the exit of Greece fr om the euro area, widespread runs on 
bank deposits, a disorderly sovereign default,  or the failure of a large European bank.5  
Reflecting the greater financial stress, bot h sovereign and private borrowing costs in 
Europe soar—with corporate bond spreads ri sing 400 basis points above baseline—and 
the confidence of European households and bus inesses plummets.  Real GDP in Europe 
declines about 9 percent re lative to baseline by the e nd of 2013, notwithstanding a  
25 percent depreciation in the real effective fo reign exchange value of the euro.  Europe’s 
difficulties are assumed to have important financial and economic spillovers to the rest of the world, including the United States.  U.S. economic activity contracts sharply, as U.S. corporate bond spreads rise more than 300 basi s points, the stock market plunges, credit 
availability is restricted, and household and business confidence erodes.  In addition, 
weaker foreign economic activity  and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress 
U.S. net exports.  All told, U.S. real GDP d eclines at an average annual rate of about  
3 percent through the end of next year.  Th e unemployment rate rises to 11¼ percent in 
2014 before beginning to gradually decline.  W ith substantially greater resource slack and 
lower import prices, overall U.S. consumer pr ices fall in the second half of 2012 and in 
                                                 
5 European policymakers could take more-sizable steps toward resolving the crisis than assumed 
in the baseline, thereby substantially easing financial and fiscal stresses and prompting a faster European 
recovery.  This possibility was analyzed in one of th e alternative scenarios presented in Book A of the 
March 2012 Tealbook.

  2013; inflation turns positive in 2014 as a rec overy in economic activity begins to take 
hold.6  Under these conditions, the federal funds  rate remains at its effective lower bound 
until early 2017. 
Hard Landing in China 
Although real GDP growth in China has slowed  substantially in recent quarters, in 
our baseline forecast China’s economy continues to expand at close to an 8 percent rate.  
However, important downside risks attend this  outlook, including a real estate collapse or 
a sharp deceleration in the supply of credit if problems mount in China’s banking sector.  
In this scenario, despite stimulative governme nt policies, real GDP growth in China falls 
to a 5 percent pace over the next two years due to tighter credit conditions, lower 
investment, and reduced household and business confidence.  Moreover, we assume that 
China’s slowdown has pronounced global spillo vers, especially to other major U.S. 
trading partners in Asia.  As a result, the trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar 
appreciates about 5 percent a bove baseline and total foreign growth falls 1 percentage 
point below baseline.  The stronger dollar a nd weaker foreign growth, in combination, 
represent an unusually large s hock to the U.S. external s ector, particularly as these 
restraining factors persist for over two years.  U.S. real net exports decline substantially, 
leading U.S. real GDP to expand at an annua l rate of only about 1 percent in the second 
half of this year and in 2 013.  The unemployment rate rise s to 8½ percent by the end of 
this year and remains at that level through 2014.  Core PCE inflation declines to just above 1¼ percent in 2013 and 2014 because of  both the appreciation in the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar and lower resource utilization.  The liftoff of the federal 
funds rate from its effective lower bo und is delayed until the middle of 2015.  
                                                 
6 The rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects the forward-looking 
nature of inflation determination in SIGMA and the relatively modest degree of structural inflation 
persistence.  In particular, long-run inflation expecta tions remain firmly anchored at 2 percent, marginal 
costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, an d productivity is weaker (reflecting reduced capital 
spending).  In addition, import price inflation runs si gnificantly higher than in the baseline as the dollar’s 
initial appreciation is gradually reversed.  Under alternative specifications of SIGMA that, for instance, 
allowed for more structural persistence in the infla tion process or a less firm anchoring of inflation 
expectations, inflation would remain low for a longer period.

 New  Exhibits  in the Risks and Uncertainty  Section 
With this  Tealbook,  we introduce two  new exhibits in the Risks and  Uncertainty  
section.  One exhibit, “Alternative  Projections,”  compares  the staff’s baseline 
forecast with three alternative  economic  projections.   The second  exhibit, 
“Assessment  of Key Macroeconomic  Risks,” presents  estimates  of the likelihood  
of specific economic  events associated  with inflation,  unemployment,  and a 
recession.   These exhibits  will ordinarily  be presented  for reference,  without 
explanatory  text. 
The first page of the two‐page  exhibit “Alternative  Projections”  compares  the 
Tealbook  baseline projection  with forecasts  from the staff’s FRB/US and EDO 
models along with the consensus  forecast from the Blue Chip survey.  The  second 
page provides  a graphical  representatio n of the Blue Chip consensus  forecast 
and the staff’s baseline projection  along with information  about the range of  
forecasts  from the Blue Chip  panel.  The FRB/US  model is a workhorse  model of  
the Board staff.  It is used for a variety  of purposes,  including  to generate most  of 
the alternative scenarios  that appear in this section.   EDO is another workhorse  
model of  the Board staff; it is an estimated  dynamic stochastic  general 
equilibrium  (DSGE) model, similar in  structure to several  other DSGE models in 
use around the System, and  forecasts  from EDO are regularly  included  in the 
Systemwide  analysis of DSGE models.  In  addition,  the staff has long consulted  
forecasts  from both the FRB/US and  EDO models when preparing  its judgmental  
economic  projection.  
The “Alternative  Projections”  table can be used to assess how  the latest 
forecasts  from these four  sources compare,  as well as to see how each has  
evolved since the time  of the previous  Tealbook.   For example,  the FRB/US 
forecast currently  shows a gradual  acceleration  in real GDP through 2014 that is a 
bit steeper but not  greatly different than  the staff projection.   In comparison,  the 
EDO forecast shows an acceleration  in real GDP earlier  in the projection  period.  
In regard to revisions  since the last  Teal book, the FRB/US forecast for real GDP 
growth has revised up  in 2013, relative to June, while the other projections  are 
nearly unchanged.   The upward  revision to the  FRB/US projection  reflects that 
model’s more favorable  estimates  of underlying  financial conditions  and trend 
output growth.  
The two‐page  exhibit “Assessment  of Key Macroeconomic  Risks” presents  
estimated  probabilities  of selected  macroeconomic  events based on stochastic  
simulations  of the FRB/US and  EDO models as  well as two other,  nonstructural  
models, namely,  a Bayesian  vector autoregressive  (BVAR) model and  a factor 
model.  The BVAR model contains  six quarterly  variables:   real GDP growth, the 
unemployment  rate, total PCE inflation,  the percent change in the relative price 
of crude oil, the federal funds  rate, and the spread of the BBB bond rate over the  
90‐day Treasury  bill rate.  The spareness  of structure  and judgment  underlying

the BVAR model provides  a useful comparison  with the staff’s FRB/US and EDO 
models, both  of which naturally  embody the views of the model builders.  Finally  
there is the factor model—the same  one that was described  in the box 
“Assessing  the Near ‐Term Outlook with Factor  Models” in  the March  2012 
Tealbook—which,  because of its orienta tion toward  short‐term forecasting, is  
used only in the bottom panel of the table. 
The top panels of both pages focus on inflation;  the table on the first page 
presents estimated  probabilities  that total PCE inflation over the next  four 
quarters—currently, the  four quarters  ending in the second quarter of 2013—will 
be either 1 percentage  point above or 1  percentage point below  the Committee’s  
stated long‐run objective.   In the top panel on  the second  page, time series are 
displayed  of the probabilities  from two of the models used to generate  the 
results in the table.  These time series of probabilities,  which are estimated  using 
real‐time data, provide a historical  perspective  on what constitutes  an unusually  
high or low probability  and on how these probabilities  fluctuate  over time.   The 
middle panels of both pages present probabilities  that the unemployment  rate 
will increase or  decrease  by 1 percentage point over th e four quarters  following  
the latest quarterly  observation.   (Currently, therefore,  the probabilities  describe  
the distribution  of the change in the unemployment  rate from  the second 
quarter of 2012 to the  second quarter of 2013.)  The bottom  panel of both pages 
presents the models’ estimated  probabilities  that real GDP will decline  in both of 
the next two quarters,  a commonly  used definition  of a recession.  
The event probabilities around  the staff projection  (the first column in the table) 
are based on historical  Tealbook  forecast errors applied to the Tealbook  baseline,  
similar to the  procedure  for the confidence  intervals  based on Tealbook  
projection  errors that are  regularly  presented  in the exhibit “Selected  Tealbook  
Projections  and 70 Percent Confidence Intervals” in  this section.  All of the other 
probability  estimates  shown are  based on stochastic  simulations  of the relevant 
model carried  out with respect  to each model’s baseline forecast,  with the 
shocks drawn from the distribution  of each model’s  historical  residuals.    
As noted earlier, the  charts on the second page provide a historical  perspective  
on the event  probabilities  estimated  from two of the models.  To  take inflation as 
an example,  both the FRB/US and BVAR models  viewed the risk of inflation being 
higher than 3 percent to be elevated  in early 2008, owing to increases  in food 
and energy prices  at that time.   But that assessment  turned out to be short lived  
as the recession deepened,  and by the end of 2008 and  into 2009, both  models 
instead saw the risk of  inflation being below 1 percent to be elevat ed.  In 
contrast,  the two models  differed in their views of inflation risks during  the 2001–
04 period:  In late 2001, the  BVAR model  saw very high risks of low inflation while 
the FRB/US model was  relatively  sanguine;  the reverse pattern occurred  in 2003.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
NAIRU.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaledby real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.  Quarterly figures for changein HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
