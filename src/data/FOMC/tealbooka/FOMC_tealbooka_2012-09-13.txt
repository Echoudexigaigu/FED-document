Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received sin ce the July Tealbook su ggests that economic 
activity is increasing at nearly its trend pace,  similar to our view a month ago.  To be 
sure, there were some upside surprises among the incoming data—most notably, retail 
sales and payroll employment.  However, se veral indicators of the near-term pace of 
economic activity, including capital goods orders, private construction spending, and 
surveys of consumer and business sentiment, have been disappointi ng.  As a result, we 
have upgraded only slightly our assessment of the pace of activ ity in the nonfarm 
economy over the second half of this year.  Taking on board the effects of the drought, 
which now look likely to have a larger e ffect on farm output than we previously 
estimated, our forecast for the growth of real GDP over the second half of the year is about unchanged at an average a nnual rate of 1½ percent.   
As a platform for Committee discu ssion, our medium-term projection is 
conditioned on the assumption of no changes in monetary policy.  In particular, we have 
assumed that the maturity extension program will continue through the end of this year 
and that no additional balance sheet actions will be taken.  In contrast, market participants 
believe that the Committee is likely to announc e—perhaps as soon as at the end of the 
September meeting—a significant expansion of the System portfolio and an extension of 
the date used in the Committee’s forward guidance.  Because these market expectations 
are not fulfilled in our baselin e projection, asset prices gra dually reflect over the next 
couple of quarters a recognition that monetary  policy will be more restrictive over the 
medium term than market partic ipants had previously believed. 
Under these assumptions, our economic proj ection for the medium term is broadly 
similar to that in the July Tealbook; it features a modest pickup in the pace of economic 
activity and a reduction in the unemploym ent rate over the next three years.
1  We have 
upgraded the outlook a touch, refl ecting, in part, a slightly better outlook for Europe and 
our assessment that not all of the recent improvement in equity prices is related to heightened expectations of further accommodation in monetary policy.  Accordingly, we 
project that real GDP will rise nearly 2½ percent in 2013 and will then accelerate to a 
                                                 
1 In line with the extension of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) being undertaken in 
conjunction with the current FOMC meeting, we discuss our expectations for SEP-level variables through 
2015.  For more detailed aspects of the projection, the discussion is confined to the period ending in 2014.

  3¼ percent pace in 2014, reflecting a lessening of the restraint from fiscal policy and 
further improvements in financial conditi ons, credit availability, and household and 
business confidence.  We project that the une mployment rate will edge down to 8 percent 
by the end of 2013.  Thereafter, with the pace of activity picking up, the downward tilt in unemployment becomes more pronounced; by th e end of 2015, we have it moving below 
7 percent—still about 1 percen tage point above our estimate of its natural rate.  In 
addition to importantly influencing the c ontours of the baseline forecast, both the 
European financial crisis and the domestic fe deral fiscal situation continue to present 
significant downside risks to the outlook. 
Readings on core inflation have come in  about as we expected in the previous 
projection, and the inflation forecast is essent ially unchanged:  With long-term inflation 
expectations well anchored, significant margins of slack in labor and product markets projected to persist, and relatively small m ovements projected for commodity prices and 
import prices, we expect core PCE inflation to hold steady at a bout 1½ percent through 
2014.  In 2015, with the margin of slack diminish ing somewhat further, core inflation is 
expected to edge up to 1¾ per cent.  Our projection for total consumer price inflation this 
year, at 1¾ percent, is about ¼ percenta ge point higher than in the July Tealbook, 
reflecting the recent rise in oil prices.  Thereaf ter, total PCE inflation is anticipated to run 
slightly below core, as energy prices edge dow n and the higher food price inflation that is 
expected to begin later this y ear, which is related to the droug ht in the Midwest, proves to 
be transitory.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
Consistent with the results from the estimated outcome-based policy rule, we 
assume that liftoff of the target federal funds rate from its effective lower bound will 
occur in the third quarter of 2014.2  Liftoff occurs one quarter  earlier than in the July 
Tealbook, reflecting the slightly stronger economic outlook in this projection; this earlier 
date returns the liftoff assumption to where it was in the June projection. 
 The path of the federal funds rate in th e baseline projection can be sensitive to the 
choice of policy rule.  As discussed in Book B,  the Taylor (1999) rule projects the same

 Revisions  to the Staff Projection  since  the Previous  SEP 
The FOMC  last published  its Survey of Economic  Projections  (SEP) following  the June FOMC 
meeting.   The table  below summarizes  revisions  to the staff economic  projection  since the June  
Tealbook  and extends the  projection  to 2015.   
The staff projection  for real activity is little changed  since June.   Both the downward  revision to  
the projectio n for real GDP  growth in the second  half of 2012 and the upward revision to 
growth in 2013 largely reflect the effect of the drought on farm production  this year and  its 
expected  return to normal  next year.  Accordingly, the  projection  for the unemployment  rate 
through 2014 is about unch anged from the June Tealbook.   In 2015, the  staff projects a further  
strengthening  of GDP growth and a somewhat  more pronounced  decline in the unemployment  
rate, reflecting  a further waning  of the headwinds  that have been restraining  activity.  
Nonetheless, significant  slack remains even at the end  of 2015. 
The staff projection  for cor e PCE inflation is  also about unchanged  since June.   The projection  
for overall PCE  inflation has been revised up  in the second half of this year, primarily  reflecting  
the upward movement in  crude oil prices since the time  of the June Tealbook.   But these 
effects are projected  to be short‐lived,  and overall PCE inflation after this  year remains  a touch 
below core inflation,  about the same as the staff projected  in June.  In 2015, with a smaller 
degree of slack, inflation is projected  to edge up closer to the FOMC’s long‐run objective  of 
2 percent.    
With the economic  outlook about unchanged,  the outcome ‐based policy rule calls for the 
federal funds  rate to move  above its  effective  lower bound  in the third quarter of 2014, the 
same as in the June Tealbook.  By  the end of 2015, the  federal funds  rate is now projected  to 
reach about  2¼ percent.

  liftoff date as does the outcome-based rule.  However, the rule that targets the level of 
nominal GDP would postpone liftoff until the fourth quarter of 2014, while the standard 
optimal-control exercise indicates that increases  in the federal funds rate would begin in 
the fourth quarter of 2015.3  In contrast, the Taylor (1993)  rule and the first-difference 
rule call for firming to begin earlier than  under the outcome-based rule.  Indeed, the 
Taylor (1993) rule calls for an immediate and substantial in crease in the federal funds 
rate.4 
As noted earlier, we have conditioned the September Tealbook projection on the 
balance sheet policies to which the FOMC agreed at its most recent meeting.  In 
particular, we assume that the maturity ex tension program will continue through the end 
of this year and that no additional balance sheet actions will be taken.  Because industry reports and surveys suggest that financial ma rket participants place substantial odds on 
the Committee adopting a new program of la rge-scale asset purchases (LSAPs), our 
projection incorporates some su rprise among market participan ts as they gradually come 
to realize, in a process co mpleted by early 2013, that a further LSAP program is not 
forthcoming and that the current forward gui dance regarding the federal funds rate will 
remain in place.
5   
Other Interest Rates 
The 10-year Treasury yield ha s risen about 15 basis point s, on net, since the time 
of the July Tealbook.  This increase reflects ec onomic data that were , on the whole, better 
than market participants had expected as well as less pessimism about the European crisis.  The effects of these developments on Treasury yields evidently more than offset 
increased market expectations for additiona l monetary easing in the near term.   
We assume that the downward pressure that is currently being placed on the 
10-year Treasury yield by expectations of further monetary accommodation will dissipate by early next year.  More broadly, we projec t that the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds 
                                                 
3 The optimal-control policy noted here is conducted with the FRB/US model under the strong 
assumption that future policymakers will remain committed to the plan currently deemed optimal as long as 
economic conditions evolve as expected.  If we assume  instead that future policy may reoptimize at their 
discretion, then the optimal-control liftoff date wo uld shift back to the first quarter of 2015.  
4 All of these estimates allow for dynamic feedback  from the stance of monetary policy to the real 
economy and inflation using the FRB/US model; such feedback can have important implications for the estimated timing of tightening under the different rules. 
5 The July Tealbook also incorporated this type of learning about unconventional policy on the 
part of market participants.

  will rise about 2 percentage points to around 3¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2014.  
This projected increase primar ily reflects the movement of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates and a gradual waning of the 
effects of nonconventional monetary policy.  In addition, we assume that downward 
pressure on Treasury rates will lessen next year  as concerns abate about both the crisis in 
Europe and the fiscal situation at home a nd as the domestic ec onomic recovery gains 
traction.   
Yields on investment-grade corporat e bonds were little changed over the 
intermeeting period despite the increase in  yields on comparable-maturity Treasury 
bonds, leaving the implied risk spread about 15 basis points narrower.  We expect this 
spread to hold fairly steady through the first half of next year and then to narrow more 
than ½ percentage point in 2013 and 2014 as co ncerns about Europe and the U.S. fiscal 
situation diminish.  Thus, we expect that the yield on investment-grade corporate bonds 
will increase 1¼ percentage points during th e projection period.  Conventional mortgage 
rates have not changed much since late Jul y, so their spreads to Treasury yields have 
narrowed as well.  In the July Tealbook, we had anticipated a narrowing largely along 
these lines, so we have not revised the medium -term projection for this  spread.  All told, 
we expect mortgage rates to rise about 1¾ percentage points duri ng the projection period. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
Broad U.S. stock price indexes have incr eased about 5 percent,  on net, since the 
July Tealbook, as market participants appear ed to take solace from developments in 
Europe and incoming economic data, and as they appeared to build in heightened 
expectations of additional monetary easing.  Equity prices are proj ected to show only a 
small increase over the next few quarters as concerns about the Eur opean crisis and the 
U.S. fiscal situation continue to weigh on inve stor sentiment and as the market reacts to 
the absence of a new LSAP.  However, with these concerns anticipated to diminish, we 
continue to project increases in equity prices of about 9 percent per year in 2013 and 
2014.  On average, the trajectory of equity pr ices is about 2½ percent higher in those two 
years than in the July projection.  
Recent readings for the CoreLogic house price index were stronger than we had 
expected and indicate that hous e price gains were robust thro ugh July.  We marked up the 
projected path for house prices over th e projection period by about 1½ percent.  
However, we continue to project that growth  in house prices will slow in the second half

  of this year, in part because we expect to  see an increase in the supply of distressed 
properties for sale as some of the largest mortgage servicers step up the pace of 
foreclosure proceedings upon implementing the te rms of their recent settlement with the 
State Attorneys General.  In to tal, house prices are expected to increase about 6 percent 
this year but only 2 percent, on average, in 2013 and 2014. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are little ch anged in this forecast and continue to 
imply that federal fiscal policy will exert a substantial drag on ec onomic growth in the 
medium term, especially next year.  In part icular, we still assume that the temporary 
payroll tax cut and the EUC program will expi re at the beginning of next year, as 
scheduled under current law.  We also con tinue to assume that federal discretionary 
spending will be restrained by the caps in the Budget Control Act and by reductions in 
defense spending, as overseas military ope rations are scaled back.  However, the 
additional cuts scheduled to take effect  in January 2013 under the act’s automatic 
sequestration are assumed to be replaced by more-gradual budget measures that achieve 
the same amount of cumulative deficit reduction through fiscal year 2021.  We have also 
maintained our assumption that, other than the temporary payroll tax cu t, most federal tax 
provisions set to expire at the end of this  year under current law will, in fact, be 
eventually extended.6  These provisions include the tax cuts initially en acted in 2001 and 
2003, relief for most taxpayers from the alte rnative minimum tax, and a number of other 
non-stimulus-related tax reductions. 
 The legislative process for extending these tax cuts, along with replacing the 
automatic spending sequestration with deficit reduction measures that are more gradual, 
is likely to be contentious and protracted, plausibly invol ving a number of short-term 
extensions of these policies at the end of this year and in 2013.  This legislative 
wrangling is assumed to increase uncertainty about that eventual outcome—and to weigh on household and business spending—beginning late r this year and even more so in early 
2013.   
We expect that fiscal policy at all levels  of government will directly restrain the 
rate of real GDP growth by about ½ percentage point this year (excluding multiplier effects), 1 percentage point in 2013, and almo st ½ percentage point in 2014.  Reflecting 
                                                 
6 In addition, we assume that the federal debt ce iling will be lifted in time to avert a disruption in 
the timely payment of all federal obligations, including a default on the federal debt.

  both the assumed federal fiscal policy tighten ing in this projection and an anticipated 
acceleration in tax revenues as the economic recovery strengthens, the federal budget 
deficit is anticipated to narro w from $1.1 trillion (7 percent of GDP) in the current fiscal 
year to around $600 billion (4 pe rcent of GDP) in fiscal 2014. 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Foreign real GDP growth slowed to an  estimated 2¼ percent pace in the second 
quarter (somewhat less than our estimated trend of about 3 percent), a result of a 
deceleration in emerging market economies as well as a contraction in Europe.  In the 
current quarter and next, we see foreign ec onomic growth remaining subdued at about its 
second-quarter pace, owing to ongoing financia l stresses and a relatively weak U.S. 
economy.  As discussed in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section, we continue to assume that financial tensions in Europe will intensify in the near 
term as policymakers struggle to settle on a nd implement their plans to stabilize euro-area 
sovereigns and banks before beginning to improve next year, as policymakers finally 
make more progress.  Although this narrative is similar to the July Tealbook, statements 
by the ECB over the intermeeting period have  suggested a greater commitment to 
containing financial stresses, a nd we now expect these tensions  to peak at a lower level 
and correspondingly project a less severe euro-a rea recession.  Next year, as the euro-area 
recession comes to an end, as U.S. economic activity strengthens, and as monetary 
policies remain accommodative, foreign growth is expected to pick up, reaching 3½ percent by the end of 2014.  This ou tlook remains uncertain as European 
policymakers still must overcome major hurdles to address their fisc al and banking-sector 
vulnerabilities.  (For further details, see th e box “Effects of the European Situation on the 
U.S. Outlook.”)  
Since the time of the July  Tealbook, the nominal exchange value of the dollar has 
moved down somewhat, in part as the pros pect of increased ECB action led to an 
improvement in market sentiment and to an appreciation of the euro.  Nonetheless, from 
this lower starting point, we expect the dollar to  appreciate in the near term, as financial 
stresses in the euro area move back up somewhat and investors gradually reduce their expectations of additional asse t purchases by the Federal Reserve.  Thereafter, we assume 
that the dollar depreciates in real terms at about a 3 percent annual rate through the end of 
2014, in part reflecting the gradual abatement of financial stresses that pushed up the dollar earlier.  All told, the level of the real dollar is a little below that projected in the

  July Tealbook through most of the forecast period before converging to a similar level by 
the end of 2014. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
The spot price of Brent crude oil closed  at about $114 per barrel on September 4, 
up $10 since the time of the July Tealbook.  Mu ch of the increase likely reflects a 
continued rise in geopolitical tensions asso ciated with Iran and, to a smaller extent, 
improved sentiment regarding the situation in Europe.  Both the Brent futures curve and 
our forecast for the price of imported oil co ntinue to be steeply downward sloping.  The 
price of imported oil is projected to remain  at about $100 per barrel for most of 2013 and 
then to slowly decline over the reminder of  the forecast period, reaching $93 per barrel at 
the end of 2014.  Relative to the July Tealbook, this projection is about $9 higher over the 
forecast period, reflecting both highe r futures prices as well as a lessening of our negative 
adjustment to the futures curve to account for differences between the staff outlook for 
global growth and that of outside forecasters.7   
A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices  has risen about 2¼ percent since the 
July Tealbook.  The increase was concentrated in prices for metals and likely reflected 
some improvement in economic sentiment a nd the recent depreciation of the dollar.  
Prices for agricultural commodities are little  changed since the time of the previous 
Tealbook, but they remain elevated following st eep increases in June  and early July as 
the effect of this summer’s drought on cr op yields became apparent.  Overall, nonfuel 
commodity prices are projected to remain flat  through the remainder of this year and then 
to decrease at a 1¼ percent p ace thereafter, a fore cast in line with quotes from futures 
markets. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
Economic activity is estimated to have increased at a somewhat faster—though 
still only modest—pace during the first half of this year than we had anticipated in the 
July Tealbook, but our projection for growth in the second half of the year is little 
changed on net.  The third quarter appears to  have begun promisingly, as the readings for 
July on retail sales, payroll employment, and capital goods shipments each were better 
                                                 
7 Our negative adjustment, which pushes down the for ecast path of oil prices relative to the futures 
curve, reflects a staff outlook for glob al growth that is weaker than that  of outside forecasters.  However, 
relative to the July Tealbook, the slight upward revi sion to the staff forecast and downward revision to 
outside forecasts have narrowed this difference, and we have lessened our negative adjustment accordingly.

 Effects  of the European  Situation  on the U.S. Outlook 
Concerns  about the fiscal  and financial crisis in Europe increased  sharply in the summer of  
2011 as financial stresses spread to Italy  and Spain.  On balance since a year ago,  the 
foreign exchange  value of the dollar has  increased  and the European  and global 
economic  outlook has deteriorated, with  adverse effects for U.S. foreign trade.  
Heightened  concerns  about the European  situation  have also  affected  U.S. asset prices.   
To gauge the  consequences  of these developments  for the overall  U.S. economic  
outlook, we use staff models to simulate  the implications  for U.S. real GDP,  the 
unemployment  rate, and inflation.  
Prior to the intensification  of the crisis, the staff projected  in the June 2011 Tealbook  that 
real GDP growth in  the euro area would  be moderate (the red  line of the lower‐ left 
figure).  However,  real GDP in  the euro area has actually declined  (the black line), and it is 
currently  projected  to fall further  this year and part of next year.  The staff’s  outlook for 
foreign economic  growth outside the euro  area (not  shown) is also considerably  weaker 
than a year ago,  in part because of  spillovers  from the crisis.  In addition,  safe‐haven 
demands  stemming  from the crisis have contributed  to a steep appreciation  of the broad 
nominal exchange  value of the dollar (shown in  the lower‐right figure). 
The intensification  of the crisis in Europe since June  2011 has also left an imprint on  U.S. 
asset prices.  The staff estimates  that the European  crisis has had a cumulative negative  
effect on domestic equity  prices of about 10 percent.   The staff also believes that this 
downward  pressure  on equity prices resulted from revisions  by market participants  to 
their outlooks for corporate profits  over the  medium term in addition to an increase  in 
the rate of return required  by investors  to hold equities because the  downside  risks to 
the global economic  outlook increased.   In addition,  these concerns  are calculated  to 
have lowered the term‐premium  component  of yields on long ‐term nominal Treasury  
securities  about 80 basis points as the European  crisis exacerbated  flight‐to‐safety 
demands.   The staff  estimates  that yields of private domestic securities  have also been 
held down by the European  situation,  though not  by as much as Treasury  yields.   In 
particular,  yields on BBB‐ rated corporate  bonds are judged to have decreased  only about 
40 basis points, while the comparable figure  for 30‐  year residential  mortgage  rates is 
about 60 basis points.

The simulation  indicates  that the rate of real U.S. GDP growth (line 1) was held down 
about ¼ percentage point  last year, and  will be about ¾ percentage point lower  both this 
year and next.2  The appreciation  of the exchange value  of the dollar, which boosts 
imports and lowers exports, is  estimated  to have the largest negative  effect (line 2) on 
U.S. economic  activity, reducing  the rate of real GDP  growth about ½ percentage point in  
both 2012 and 2013.  The staff  estimates  that lower  economic  activity in the euro area 
(line 3), which also lowers U.S. exports,  has reduced and will continue  to reduce  the rate 
of U.S. real GDP growth about  0.1 percentage  point, on average,  from 2011 through  2013.  
Negative  spillovers  to economic  activity in other trading partners  contribute  a similar 
amount (line 4).3  The net effects  of the changes in domestic financial  conditions  (line 5) 
on U.S. GDP are small because the  drag from lower equity  prices is essentially  offset by  
the boost from  lower private  long‐term interest rates.   
 
All told, the unemployment  rate (line  6) is expected  to be almost ½ percentage point 
higher by the end of this year and  is anticipated  to be about ¾ percentage point higher  by 
the end of next year as  a result of the European  crisis.  Inflation  (line 7) is slightly lower, 
reflecting  both the higher exchange value  of the dollar and lower resource  utilization.

1 The table reflects  calculations  from several staff models.   In particular,  the decomposition  of the 
trade effects uses the trade  model maintained  by the International  Finance Division,  while  the estimate 
of the overall macroeconomic  effects  is based on simulations  of the FRB/US model.  In the FRB/US 
simulations,  the federal funds  rate is set using the same estimated  policy rule that is used in the staff 
baseline projection,  and nonconventional  policy retains its baseline setting. 
2 These  adverse effects  are slightly smaller than would have been estimated  at the time of the July 
Tealbook  as the situation in Europe appears to have improved  a bit recently. 
3 The effect of negative  spillovers  from other trading partners is estimated  by assuming  that a 
1 percentage  point reduction  in the rate of change in euro‐area real GDP translates  to a ¼ percentage  
point  reduction  in the rate of real GDP growth in the rest of the world.  Because  the rest of the world 
makes  up a much larger share of U.S. exports than the euro area, this spillover effect ends up roughly 
the same as the euro‐area effect.

  than expected.  However, the recent forwar d-looking indicators ha ve been disappointing, 
on balance, and we estimate that the dr ought will pull down real GDP growth in the 
second half of this year.  Consequently, we estimate that real GDP will advance at an 
annual rate of just 1½ percent over this peri od, the same in as the July Tealbook.  At the 
same time, we expect the unemployment rate to hold near its current level. 
The Labor Market 
Private payroll employment rose 172,000 in  July, about 70,000 more than we had 
expected.  However, the unemployment rate e dged up to 8.3 percent in July and has been 
moving essentially sideways since early this y ear.  Likewise, the labor force participation 
rate was 63.7 percent in July, about the same as in the first and s econd quarters.  (For a 
broader discussion, see the box “Labor Force Pa rticipation Rate.”)  Other indicators of 
labor market activity are also little changed since the most recent  Tealbook:  Initial 
claims for unemployment insurance remain clos e to their levels as of the July Tealbook, 
surveys of small businesses’ hiring plans ha ve changed little in  recent months, and 
households’ expectations of future labor market conditions remain subdued.   
With output projected to rise only modes tly in the second half of the year, we 
expect the labor market to continue to impr ove only slowly in the near term.  We have 
taken some signal from the July employme nt report, and we now expect private 
employers to add 120,000 jobs per month, on average, in August and September and 
about 150,000 per month in the fourth quarter ; both of these figures are about 25,000 per 
month higher than in th e July Tealbook forecast.8  However, as before, we anticipate that 
the unemployment rate will remain at 8.3 percent for the rest of the year, as the modest 
job gains we project (even though slightly bette r than in July) are insufficient to reduce 
the jobless rate.  
The Industrial Sector 
After monthly increases averaging on ly ¼ percent in the second quarter, 
manufacturing industrial pr oduction (IP) rose ½ percent in July.  Motor vehicle 
assemblies stepped up to an annual rate of 10.7 million units in July, partly reflecting a shortening of the usual summer shutdowns  at some auto companies; however, 
automakers’ assembly schedules suggest much of this gain is likely to be unwound in 
August and September, leaving the average pace of production this quarter similar to that 
                                                 
8 After accounting for our estim ates of the distortion of the seasonal-adjustment factors, the underlying pace 
of employment gains in both the third and fourth quarters is projected to be about 130,000 per month .

 The  Labor Force Participation  Rate 
The labor  force participation  rate (the  black line in the lower‐left  figure) fell 1¾ percentage points  from 
the business  cycle peak in the last quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of this year.1  The staff  
estimates  that a little over  1 percentage point of  this decline can be attributed  to the long‐term trend 
in participation  (the red line).  This long‐term downtrend  has two  major components.   First, the share 
of the population  at older  ages, which has lower‐ than‐average participation  rates, has been rising.2  
Second, the participation  rates of young persons (the red line, on the left scale, in the lower‐ right 
figure), especially  teenagers,  have been falling  for more  than a decade.   This downtrend  among young 
persons is likely a response  to increased  incentives  for education  and to shrinking  job opportunities  for 
their age group as the ongoing polarization  of the labor market has led to jobs traditionally  held by 
young workers being  increasingly  taken by  older workers.3  
The participation  rate also  seems to have been influenced  by the financial crisis, the recession,  and 
their aftermath.  For  example,  early in the recession,  the drop in household  wealth and the many job 
losses may have led some workers to delay  retirement and  others to enter the labor force.  In addition, 
the introduction  of extended  and emergency  unemployment  compensation  likely led some job losers 
to remain  in the labor force longer than they would have otherwise.4  By 2009, however,  these 
influences  were probably  far overshadowed  by the downward  pressure  on participation  rates 
associated  with the decision of some prospective  workers not  to search  for work  in the face of poor 
job opportunities.   The staff  believes that this cyclical response  by prospective  workers explains  a 
large portion  of the overall decline in the participation  rate since 20 07.   
                                                 
1 This figure adjusts for revisions to population  weighting  in the published  data.  On a published  basis, the rate has 
fallen 2¼ percentage  points.  The discussion  in this box abstracts  from these  revisions.  
2 Although  the participation  rates at older ages  (the blue line, on the left scale, in the lower‐right  figure)  have risen 
over  the past few years, they remain well  below the average  at lower ages, so the aging of the population  has resulted 
in a lower overall participation  rate.   
3 More education  tends  to lead to greater participation  later in life.   However,  the net effect  of the increased  
incentives  for education  is likely to be to depress  the aggregate  participation  rate.   Polarization  refers to the shifting  of 
the demand for labor away from middle‐skilled jobs and toward both higher‐ and lower‐skilled jobs.   
4 The staff estimates  that these programs  boosted the level of participation  last quarter  by 0.1 percentage  point.

 In previous  recessions,  the labor force participation  rate did not fall as sharply as in the recent 
recession.   However,  the current cyclical  decline in participation  does not appear to be fundamentally  
out of line with the especially  steep deterioration  and slow recovery in  job opportunities.   Hence, we 
think that the current low participation  rate is not significantly  distorting  the signal for labor  utilization  
from the unemployment  rate.  The household  survey provides  some evidence  in this regard.  Its  
measure of persons not in the labor force but marginally  attached  is an indicator  of those who  are 
most likely to be out of the labor force because of  poor job prospects.5  The figure below shows  a 
measure of labor underutilization  that includes marginally  attached  persons (U‐5, the blue line) as well 
as one that includes all persons out of the labor  force who say they want a job (the potential  worker 
rate, the red line).  Historically,  these rates  have moved  fairly well in tandem with  the official 
unemployment  rate (the  black line), and they have continued  to be well aligned  more recently.      
Parsing the decline in participation  into trend and cyclical components  is difficult, especially  in real 
time.  Indeed, over  the past few years  the staff has revised down  its estimate  of the trend in 
participation,  mostly because research  has suggested  that more of the ongoing weakness in  
participation  reflects long‐term forces (such as polarization)  than we had assumed,  and also because 
we have judged that some of the response  to overall  poor job prospects  would persist even if labor 
demand were to recover so on.  To be sure, uncertainty  in this regard remains considerable.   Moreover,  
labor market developments  need not fit neatly into the separate categories  of trend and cycle.  For 
example,  some workers may  have accelerated  their planned retirements  in reaction to poor job 
prospects.  As  time goes by, these early retirees reach ages at which they  would have retired in any 
case.  In this example,  the trend in participation  declined  sooner in response  to the business  cycle but 
with no net effect  on the level of the trend some years hence.  
Looking ahead, the staff expects the cyclical downward  pressure on labor force participation  to 
diminish as the demand for labor  improves, even  as the long‐term downtrend  continues.   In our 
projection  these two forces are  roughly offsetting  in the medium term, and the participation  rate 
remains fairly flat, converging  slowly to its long‐term trend.   
 
                                                 
5 Marginally  attached  persons are those who are not currently  looking  for work but want a job, are available to 
work, and have looked for work  sometime  in the past  12 months.

  in the second quarter.  Outside motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output moved up 
just 0.2 percent in July after having edged down in the second quarter.   
Moreover, the available indicators of  near-term factory activity remain 
downbeat.9  With data through August, the new orders diffusion index from the national 
ISM survey and the orders indexes from the regional manufacturing surveys, on balance, 
remained weak for a third consecutive month.  Taking into account these surveys and the 
flat trajectory for motor ve hicle assemblies in the coming months, we expect factory 
output to expand at a tepid 2½ percent annual rate in th e second half of the year. 
Household Spending 
Real PCE rose 0.4 percent in July, reflec ting a surprisingly la rge jump in retail 
sales.  However, those data are quite erra tic, and with gasoline prices having moved up, 
job gains remaining modest, and consumer sentiment still relatively downbeat, we have 
not extrapolated forward the July strength in spending; indeed, we anticipate smaller 
gains in coming months.  In all, real PCE is  projected to rise at an annual rate of 
2¼ percent over the second half of the year, sim ilar to our forecast in the July Tealbook.   
The incoming data continue to point to a gradual recovery in housing activity, 
albeit from a very depressed level.  Single-fa mily housing starts have risen, on net, since 
last fall, and permits for new constructi on have steadily edged up, though both measures 
remain less than one-third of their levels of several years ago.  In addition, some signs 
indicate that housing demand ha s firmed over the past year:  Home sales have stepped up, 
while the homeowner vacancy rate has declin ed; measures of house prices have risen 
noticeably since the beginning of this year; a nd indicators of home bu ilders’ and realtors’ 
sentiment have improved.  Even so, demand remains constrained by difficult mortgage 
credit conditions and uncertainty about fu ture income and employment prospects.  
Furthermore, the stock of vacant homes held off the market, which is not included in the 
homeowner vacancy rate, remains elevated.  This “shadow inventory,” which includes 
many bank-owned properties, will likely re direct demand from new construction to 
existing homes once these proper ties are put on the market.  All told, we project single-
family starts to increase only modestly in the near term. 
                                                 
9 We currently estimate that Hurricane Isaac reduced the rate of change in total IP in August by about 
0.3 percentage point, principally from the preventative idling of  nearly all of the oil and gas extraction in the Gulf of 
Mexico and, to a lesser extent, from the shutdown of se veral Gulf Coast petroleum refineries.  Production in the 
affected industries is expected to return to  pre-hurricane levels by the end of September.

  At the same time, some of the factors restraining home purchases have fueled 
demand for rental units, leading to falling vacan cy rates and rising re nts.  Consequently, 
activity in the multifamily sector has picked up more rapidly than in the single-family 
sector, and we expect to see a continued upswing in multifamily starts in coming months 
as these conditions persist.   
Business Investment  
We estimate that real business spending on equipment and software (E&S) rose at 
a modest annual rate of about 4 percent in the second quarter, somewhat less than 
projected in the July Tealbook.  We expect sp ending to decelerate further in the second 
half of the year as concerns about the European situation, the U.S. fiscal situation, and the 
sluggish pace of the domestic recovery make bus inesses more reluctant to invest.  Indeed, 
new orders for nondefense capital goods outside  of transportation ha ve fallen sharply 
over the past several months and currently sta nd notably below the leve l of shipments.   
Consistent with this view, a number of  other forward-looking indicators of 
business investment also point to subdued in creases in business outlays.  For example, 
indexes from various surveys of business condi tions have been at low levels for several 
months, surveys of capital spending plans ha ve continued to be downbeat, and corporate 
bond spreads remain somewhat elevated.  As a result, we expect E&S spending to increase at an annual rate of only around 1 percent over the second half of this year.  
After a year of surprising strength, incoming data suggest that spending on 
nonresidential constructi on (excluding drilling and mining) ro se at a moderate pace in the 
second quarter.  However, the spending data for July, the subdued readings from the 
architectural billings index, and the sector’s  poor fundamentals lead us to project that 
outlays will decline somewhat in the second ha lf of this year.  Moreover, although there 
are hints of some easing in financing conditi ons for existing commercial real estate, we 
anticipate that high va cancy rates, low commercial re al estate prices, and difficult 
financing conditions for new construction wi ll continue to put downward pressure on 
building activity for the foreseeable future.  
In the drilling and mining sector, investme nt edged down in the first half of 2012, 
likely reflecting the low natural gas prices th at have prevailed sin ce the second half of 
last year.  Nevertheless, spending remains at a high level following brisk increases in the 
previous two years that we re driven by rising crude o il prices and by new drilling

  techniques.  We expect outlays for drilling a nd mining structures to remain near current 
levels in the near term, in line with the rela tively flat trajectories  of energy prices.  
Firms in the nonfarm business sector app ear to have accumulated inventories in 
the second quarter at a rate sim ilar to that in the first quarter , as some further restocking 
of auto dealers’ lots offset a slowing in the pace of accumulation elsewhere.  Available 
estimates from the staff’s flow-of-goods system , reports on dealer inventories of motor 
vehicles, and surveys of inventory satisfaction generally indicate that  inventory stocks are 
fairly well aligned with sales in most s ectors, although some indi cators suggest perhaps 
less comfort with inventories than was the ca se earlier in the year.  In the current 
economic environment we expect producers to be cautious in boosting the pace of 
stockbuilding, and so we expect  inventory investment to c ontribute only a little to real 
GDP growth over the rest of the year.  
By contrast, we estimate that the sharp drop in farm production stemming from 
the drought will lead to a signifi cant drawdown in farm inventories this quarter, which by 
itself will subtract about ½ percentage point (annual rate) from real GDP growth.  We 
expect that farm stocks will be liquidated at  about the same pace in the fourth quarter, 
which will consequently have no arithmetic  effect on GDP growth in that quarter. 
Government  
Real federal purchases fell at an annual ra te of 2¼ percent in the first half of 2012, 
driven by declines in defense spending.  As in the July Tealbook, we anticipate broadly 
similar reductions in tota l federal purchases in the second half of the year. 
By contrast, the contraction in the state and local sector appe ars to be gradually 
moderating, as fiscal conditions of these governments become somewhat less tight.  After 
dropping at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first quarter, r eal state and local purchases 
fell 1 percent in the second quarter, and we anticipate an ev en smaller decline in the 
second half of the year.  In part, the moderation is reflecte d in a slowing in the pace of 
decline in real public constr uction expenditures in  the second quarter, a trend that we 
expect to continue over the rest  of the year.  In addition, the decrease in state and local 
payrolls during the first half of the year was considerably smaller than in 2011; we expect 
payrolls to decline a little further in the th ird quarter before stab ilizing in the fourth 
quarter.  In total, federal, state, and local pur chases are expected to subtract ¼ percentage 
point from the annual rate of real GDP growth in the second half of this year.

  Foreign Trade  
After having risen at an annual rate of 6 percent in the second quarter, real exports 
of goods and services are expected to decel erate to a 3¼ percent increase over the second 
half of this year, more in line with the rela tively sluggish pace of foreign growth that we 
anticipate as well as th e prior appreciation of the dollar.  This for ecast is about the same 
as in the July Tealbook, as our reaction to th e strength of exports in the trade data for 
June and the effects of the decline in the dolla r since July offset weaker projected exports 
of agricultural products as a consequence of this summer’s drought.  Meanwhile, real 
imports of goods and services are expected to increase 3¼ percent ove r the second half of 
2012, almost 1½ percentage points less than in the previous Tealbook, reflecting the 
lower dollar, our response to a weaker-than- expected reading on imports in June, and a 
markdown to our forecast for oil import growth.  All told, we expect th e external sector to 
be about neutral for GDP growth in the third quarter and to subtract  ¼ percentage point 
from growth in the fourth quarter, a contour that is on average about ¼ percentage point 
less of a drag than projected in July.   
Prices and Wages  
Total PCE price inflation stepped down fr om an annual rate of 2½ percent in the 
first quarter to ¾ percent in the second quart er, reflecting both the large drop in energy 
prices during the spring and some deceleration in core PCE prices.  Over the second half 
of this year, total PCE prices are projected to rise at an averag e annual rate of about 
1¾ percent, reflecting the rebound in oil prices since the Ju ly Tealbook.  Compared with 
our previous projection, total PCE inflati on is nearly ¾ percentage point higher on 
average in the second half of this year.  
Spot and futures prices of food comm odities soared through mid-July as the 
severity of this summer’s drought became a pparent, and these prices have remained 
elevated in recent weeks.  The pass-thr ough of farm commodity price changes into 
consumer food prices tends to occur with a lag, and, moreover, a lower-than-expected 
reading on consumer food prices  in July led us to revise down  our current-quarter 
estimate for PCE food price inflation by about ¾ percentage point, to  an annual rate of 
1½ percent.  Looking ahead, we project that PCE food price in flation will move up to an 
annual rate of 3½ percent in the fourth qua rter as the pass-through of farm commodity 
price increases into PCE food prices begins in earnest.  Notw ithstanding these substantial 
swings, the projected accelerat ion in food prices provides only a small boost to total

  consumer price inflation because of the re latively small weight of food in overall 
consumer expenditures.   
The incoming data on core consumer price inflation have been close to our 
expectations.  Core PCE price inflation slowed from an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the 
first quarter to 1¾ percent in the second quarter, and core pri ces were flat in July.  We 
continue to expect core PCE inflation to run at an annual rate of 1½ percent over the 
second half of 2012, reflecting, in part, recent declines in the prices of core imports and 
industrial materials.  
 In the latest data, the quarterly pattern of priv ate hourly compensation was 
revised up noticeably for the first half of the y ear.  However, this series is particularly 
volatile, and the second quarter was only a little  more than 2 percent above its level four 
quarters earlier, the same as in the July Tealbook.  In addition, the employment cost index 
for private industry workers rose about 2 perc ent in the second quarter, close to what we 
had expected.  We anticipate th at hourly compensation will ri se during the second half of 
this year at roughly that pace, similar to our forecast in the July Tealbook. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
The broad contour of the medium-term projec tion is similar to our forecast in the 
July Tealbook.  In particular, we continue  to project that further improvements in 
financial conditions, an eventual easing of the financial crisis in Europe, and rising 
household and business confiden ce will support a modest acceleration in real GDP.  In 
addition, although the tightening of fiscal policy in 2013 is  anticipated to impose a 
substantial drag on economic growth next year, the fiscal restraint on growth is expected 
to ease significantly in 2014, which contributes materially to the accel eration in real GDP 
in that year.  Still, a number of persistent headwinds are ex pected to ease only slowly and 
so continue to weigh on the pace of the recovery over the projection period, including 
tight credit for some households and busine sses, the ongoing drag from the widespread 
losses in home equity, an overhang of vacant homes that continues to hold back 
residential construction, and fore ign demand that remains subdued.   
We raised our projection for real GDP growth a bit in 2013, in part because the 
expected rebound in farm production after the drought-str icken harvest of 2012 boosts 
aggregate output.  In addition, the recent decline in the do llar in response to 
developments in Europe implies less drag on U. S. activity from the external sector.  Also,

  the small upward revisions we made to st ock prices and house prices boosts household 
wealth.  These positive factors modestly out weigh the drag from higher oil prices next 
year.  As a result, after increasing about 1½ pe rcent this year, real GDP is projected to 
rise 2½ percent next year (about ¼ percentage  point more than in the July Tealbook) and 
then to expand 3¼ percent in 2014 and 3½ perc ent in 2015.  With real GDP expected to 
increase at about the same pace as the growth  rate of potential output this year and next, 
the unemployment rate does not decline to below 8 percent until 2014—when real GDP 
begins to rise materially fast er than potential.  By the end of 2015, the unemployment rate 
is projected to have decl ined to 6¾ percent.   
As has been the case for some time, part of the fiscal restraint in our projection 
shows through as declining federal purchase s.  After decreasing 4¼ percent in 2011 and 
2½ percent this year, real federal purchases ar e expected to fall about 4¼ percent in both 
2013 and 2014, reflecting the effects of the Budget Control Act and the continued 
drawdown of overseas military op erations.  In the state and lo cal sector, fiscal conditions 
are likely to remain ti ght for some time; although state tax revenues have been rising at a 
pace consistent with income growth, local taxes, which are domina ted by property taxes, 
have been stagnant, and federal stimulus–r elated grants have essentially ended.  
Consequently, we expect real state and local pu rchases to be about fl at in 2013 and to rise 
at a tepid pace in 2014.  In total, federal, st ate, and local purchase s are anticipated to 
subtract about ¼ percentage point from real GDP growth in 2013 and in 2014. 
The large fiscal drag we expect next y ear also shows through  indirectly to the 
growth in consumer spending.  The assumed expi ration at the end of this year of both the 
temporary payroll tax cut and the EUC program  will subtract significantly from income 
growth in 2013, and thus will likely weigh on consumer spending, particularly early in 
the year.  By contrast, higher equity w ealth, increasing household confidence, and a 
modestly improving labor market should pr ovide support for consumer spending.  In 
total, real PCE is expected to expand 2½ percent in 2013, only about  ¼ percentage point 
faster than this year.  In 2014, consumer spendi ng is projected to accele rate further, as the 
drag from fiscal policy wanes and as employment prospects, income growth, and 
household net worth continue to improve.   
With the economies of our trading partne rs anticipated to improve, and with the 
dollar expected to depreciate over the medium term, real exports are projected to increase 
4½ percent in 2013 and 5¾ percent in 2014.  Real  imports are expected to grow at an

  average pace of 4½ percent over the medium term, supported by a pickup in the pace of 
U.S. economic activity that more than offs ets the drag stemming from a depreciating 
dollar.  Overall, we expect net trade to make small negati ve contributions to real GDP 
growth next year and in 2014; this drag is slightly less th an in the previous Tealbook due 
to the lower path for the exch ange value of the dollar.  
Despite the fact that many large firms have ample cash on hand and ready access 
to capital markets, lackluster demand and uncer tainty about sales prospects appear to be 
restraining businesses’ capital spending plans.  Moreover, until the r ecovery is clearly on 
a stronger footing, the business sector as a whole will likely re main cautious.  We 
therefore continue to expect  expenditures on E&S to strengthen only grad ually over the 
medium term, rising 5 percent in 2013 before  stepping up to a growth rate of about 
7 percent in 2014, as economic conditions and bu siness sentiment continue to improve.   
Many of these same factors are holding back business investment in 
nonresidential structures (other  than drilling and mining).  In  addition, with persistently 
high vacancy rates and continued tight c onditions for construction and development 
loans, we expect real construc tion spending to be about flat next year and to manage only 
small gains in 2014.  In contrast, investment in drilling and mining is expected to rise 
over the medium term following its decline this year, as the new horizontal drilling 
techniques are further deployed. 
Although the incoming data point to an  ongoing improvement in housing activity, 
the recovery in this sector is still expected to be meager.  Historically low mortgage rates 
would normally be expected to bolster home pur chases and lead to a significant increase 
in new construction over the medium term.  However, the ongoing difficulties faced by 
many households in accessing mortgage credit,  coupled with lingeri ng uncertainty about 
employment and income prospects, are likely to materially restrain the impetus from low 
mortgage rates.  In addition, the flow of home s from foreclosure into the resale market is 
expected to remain substantial, thus limiting the demand for new construction.  
Accordingly, we project single-family housi ng starts to rise only gradually over the 
forecast period to an annual rate  nearing 750,000 units by the end of 2014.

  AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the Natura l Rate of Unemployment 
We have made no material changes to our estimates of aggregate supply in this 
projection.  We estimate that, after rising about 1¾ percent this year, potential GDP will 
increase about 2 percent through 2014.  We cont inue to assume that the natural rate of 
unemployment will remain at 6 percent through 2014.10 
Productivity and th e Labor Market  
Output per hour in the nonfarm business se ctor rose at an annual rate of about 
¾ percent in the first half of this year, roughly the same pace as in 2011 but somewhat 
faster than we had anticipated in the July T ealbook.  We estimate th at the level of labor 
productivity was about ½ percent above its structural trend in the second quarter, 
compared with no gap being shown in our previo us forecast.  We expect that this gap will 
essentially close over the proj ection period as labor productiv ity rises a bit less than its 
trend rate.  The slower rise  in labor productivity—around ¼ percentage point per year 
less than in the July projec tion—occurs as firms bring thei r labor inputs into better 
alignment with their production needs by increasing hours and employment somewhat 
more quickly than in the July Tealbook.   
The projected path for pa yroll employment also reflects the slightly faster 
increase in real GDP in this projection.  In  2013, increases in private payroll employment 
are expected to average about 150,000 per m onth, a little greater than in the July 
Tealbook.  As GDP growth moves well above its trend rate in 2014, private employment 
gains pick up to a more solid pace of around 225,000 per month.  The employment gains 
we project for 2013 are still fairly modest, and the decline in th e unemployment rate, 
from 8¼ percent currently to 8 percent in th e final quarter of ne xt year, is mostly 
attributable to the expiration of the EUC progr am at the end of this year.  The somewhat 
faster pace of hiring in 2014 brings do wn the unemployment rate to just above 
7½ percent at the end of 2014.   
                                                 
10 We estimate that the boost to the “effective” natural rate of unemployment from the emergency 
and extended unemployment insurance programs has diminished and is worth only about ¼ percentage 
point at present.  This effect is expected to dissipate completely next  year as these programs are fully 
wound down.

  Resource Utilization 
Labor market slack remains considerable  throughout the medium-term forecast, 
with the unemployment rate at the end of 2014 still 1½ pe rcentage points above our 
estimate of the natural rate.  The gap be tween actual and potential GDP narrows only 
slightly next year and does not begin to sh rink perceptibly until 2014; real GDP at the end 
of 2014 is a bit more than 3 percent below our estimate of potential output. 
From the end of 2007 through 2010, manu facturing capacity plunged about 
6 percent, and it has increas ed only sluggishly since th en.  Notwithstanding some 
important conceptual differences between capacity utilization and the measures of 
resource utilization mentioned earlier, there appears to be less slack  in the manufacturing 
sector currently than in the broader economy.11  Indeed, capacity utilization in 
manufacturing in July, at 77.8 percent, was only 1 percentage point  below its long-run 
average rate.  Consequently, even as the amount  of slack in the manu facturing sector and 
in the broader economy narrow at comparable rates over the rest of the projection period, 
the factory operating rate reaches its long-run average in  early 2014 despite the still-
sizable GDP gap. 
Prices and Compensation 
Overall inflation is expected to remain  subdued over the projection period.  A key 
factor influencing this projection is our assu mption that inflation expectations will remain 
stable.  Expectations for PCE price inflation over the next 10 years, as measured by the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters, were unc hanged at 2.2 percent in the third quarter, 
whereas 10-year CPI inflation expectations e dged down to 2.4 percent.  In the Michigan 
survey for August, median 5-to-10-year expected inflation increased to 3 percent.  
However, we suspect that this increase stems fr om the recent rise in gasoline prices and is 
thus likely to be transitory, si milar to the pattern we saw back in the spring; moreover, the 
latest reading is within the range in which this measure of inflation expectations has 
fluctuated over the past 10 years.  The TIPS-based measure of inflation compensation 
over the next 5 years rose 20 basis points since the July Tealbook, and the measure for 
5-to-10 years ahead rose 5 basis points.   
                                                 
11 Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly incorporates trends in labor input, 
our concept of capacity for the industrial sector focuses on the capability of plants to produce with the 
equipment that is in place and ready to operate; it does not take account of the po tential workforce, either 
inside the industrial sector or outside it.

  Another important element contributing to  the low rates of inflation in this 
projection is import prices.  Pr ices of imported core goods are expected to decrease at a 
1 percent annual rate in the sec ond half of this year, a declin e that is about ½ percentage 
point larger than in the July projection, reflect ing the lagged effects of previous declines 
in commodity prices and past dollar appreci ation.  For the remainder of the forecast 
period, core import price infla tion is expected to run at  a 1¼ percent pace, unchanged 
from the previous Tealbook.  
These factors and the still-considerable  underutilization in labor and product 
markets expected over the medium term lead us  to project core infl ation of 1.6 percent in 
both 2013 and 2014, rates that are the same as the previous projection.  Meanwhile, total 
PCE inflation is projected to run a little below core over the me dium term, as the 
anticipated declines in crude oil prices put downward pressure  on retail energy prices.  In 
2015, inflation is expected to edge up, as resource utilization increases. 
In our projection, persistent labor market slack, stable inflatio n expectations, and 
low rates of price inflation restrain gains in  our forecast for hourly compensation.  Both 
the nonfarm hourly compensation measure and th e employment cost index are projected 
to rise at or a bit below 3 percent in 2013 and in 2014.  
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff’s forecast through 2020 using the FRB/US model and 
our assumptions about long-run supply-side co nditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  
The contour of the long-term outlook de pends on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE in flation at 2 percent, consistent with 
the Committee’s strategy statement after the January 2012 meeting.  The 
federal funds rate continues to be set according to the estimated outcome-
based rule. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates in 2015 through 2017.  However, as the 
time when normalization of the portfolio draws nearer, this downward 
pressure diminishes, which contributes to the rise in the 10-year Treasury 
yield.  Beyond 2017, the process of po rtfolio normalization should be 
essentially completed.

   Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds decrease gradually to normal 
levels, and financial institutions fu rther ease their le nding standards. 
 The federal budget deficit (measured on a NI PA basis) narrows a bit further to 
3¾ percent of GDP in 2015 but widens  thereafter, refl ecting fast-rising 
transfer payments for retirement and health-care programs.  Federal debt 
increases from around 75 percent of GDP in 2015 to 80 percent by the end of 
the decade.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates 2¼  percent per year 
in 2015 through 2017; thereafter, the pace of depreciation tapers off.  The 
price of crude oil edges down in 2015 and 2016 and then holds steady in real 
terms.  Foreign real GDP growth rises slightly to a 3½ percent pace in 2015 
and then declines very gradually to a 3 percent annual rate la te in the decade. 
 The natural rate of unemployment dec lines from 6 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2014 to 5¼ percent at the e nd of 2017 as conditions in the labor 
market continue to improve, and it rema ins at that level in the long run.  
Potential GDP increases at an average annual rate of about  2¼ percent in 2015 
through the end of the decade.   
The economy is projected to enter 2015 with output still below its potential level, 
unemployment above its assumed natural rate, and inflation below the long-run objective 
of the Committee.  In the staff’s long-term forecast, further improvements in household 
and business confidence, diminishing uncerta inty, and supportive financial conditions 
enable real GDP to rise at  an average annual rate of more than 3 percent from 2015 
through 2017.  With real GDP expanding at a pace  faster than the grow th rate of potential 
output, labor market conditions improve furthe r, and the unemployment rate ends 2017 at 
5¾ percent.  With long-run in flation expectations assumed to remain well anchored and 
the margin of slack in labor and product ma rkets diminishing, consumer price inflation 
edges up gradually.  Late in the decade, the economy converg es to an unemployment rate 
near its long-run natural rate, an inflation rate at the Committee’s longer-term objective, 
and a nominal federal funds  rate of 4¼ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the second 
quarter , and we see foreign growth remaining at this subdued pace in the second half of 
this year , restrained by ongoing financial and fiscal stresses in Europe and a relatively 
weak U.S. economy.  In 2013, as the euro- area recession is projected to end, aggregate 
foreign growth is forecast  to edge up to 2¾ percent, a touch below its trend pace .  It rises 
further to 3¼ percent in 2014 as the euro -area economy starts growing and the U.S. 
expansion picks up strength.  This projection is little changed from that in the previous  
Tealbook.  We marked up our forecast of growth in the euro area, where policy 
developments have been more positive and financial conditions improved somewhat over 
the intermeeting period.   However, we made downward revisions to near -term growth in 
many other foreign economies, where recent data have been weaker than we had expected.  
In the euro area, real GDP fell i n the second quarter and more recent data point to 
a further decline in the second half of this year.  However, recent  policy developments 
have been  more promising.  Since the close of the July Tealbook, the European Central 
Bank ( ECB ) has  indicated a stronger commitment than was anticipated to resolve the 
crisis , likely through secondary- market purchases of peripheral sovereign debt,  and 
officials in Spain and Italy have signaled that they may consider  request ing external 
assistance.  In response, financi al market sentiment has generally improved, and  although 
some of this improvement may well be reversed as European leaders struggle to implement these measures , we nevertheless  anticipate  that financial stresses in the next 
several quarters will be somewhat less pronounced than we assumed  in the July 
Tealbook.  By next year, we assume financial tensions will start to ease on a more sustained basis amid further progress on the reform agenda, but full normalization of market condit ions will likely take years to achieve. 
Notwithstanding these improvements, the foreign outlook remains very uncertain.  
The risk of a much more severe intensification of the crisis  remain s serious.  Converse ly, 
if European leaders act forcefully, market conditions could improve more rapidly than we

  expect , posing some upside risk.  Outside of Europe, both a resurgence in oil prices and a 
sharp deceleration in Chinese activity pose downside risks to global growth.1
Amid subdued economic growth and declines in crude oil prices, f oreign  headline 
inflation slowed to just under 2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter and 
1¾ percent in the third.  By next quarter, as the recent run -up in crude oil prices shows 
through to retail energy prices, foreign inflation should pick up to a little above 2½ percent.  Thereafter , foreign inflation is expected to average just below this pace, little 
changed from our previous Tealbook forecast.  
Most major foreign central banks left monetary policies unchanged during the 
intermeeting period.  With  subdued inflation and weak growth prospects, we expect some 
central banks , such as the ECB , the P eople’s Bank of China, and the Bank of England 
(BOE ), to ease monetary policy in the coming months. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Real GDP growth in the advanced  foreign economies ( AFEs ) slowed from 
1.6 percent in the first quarter to 0.7 percent  in the second.  We expect growth to remain 
near this subdued pace in the second half of the year, as the euro- area recession deepens 
and activity decelerates in Japan.   Growth in the AFEs should pick up to 1¼ percent in 
2013 and nearly 2 percent in 2014, with the euro -area recession abat ing and global 
economic conditions slowly improving .  This forecast is little changed from the July 
Tealbook, as some upward revision to t he euro -area forecast is offset by downward 
revisions elsewhere in the advanced economies, where recent data indicate less momentum.  
Headline inflation in the AFEs dipped to 0.6 percent in the second quarter from 
2.2 percent in the first, with especially l arge declines in Canada, where retail energy 
prices fell, and Japan, where domestic food prices plunged.  Data suggest that AFE inflation remained subdued at around ¾ percent in the third quarter, but t he recent run -up 
in oil prices is expected to help push up inflation to nearly 2 percent in the fourth quarter, ½ percentage point higher than we previously expected .  Thereafter, our projection is

Recovery,” and “ Higher Oil Prices ” scenarios in the Risks and Uncertainty section of this Tealbook, and

  little changed  from that in the July Tealbook, with AFE inflation at 1¼  percent in 2013 
and rising to a still- modest 1¾ percent in 2014 as economic conditions improve and 
Japan hikes its consumption tax. 
Euro Area 
Euro -area GDP declined 0.7 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, and 
recent data suggest further weakening in the current quarter.  PMIs remained firmly in 
contractionary territory  in July and August, and business and consumer confidence 
worsened .  In addition, the unemployment rate was at a record 11.3 percent in June and 
July.  Accordingly, we expect the euro -area recession to deepen, with real  GDP 
contract ing at a pace of almost 1¼ percent in the second half of this year.  In 2013, the 
recession ends, but output stagnates, as continued financial stresses, fiscal consolidation, 
and other headwinds weigh on the recovery.  By 2014, these headwinds diminish, and, with monetary policy remaining accommodative, growth for the year picks up to 1¼ percen t. 
As bleak as this forecast is, it is about ¼ percentage point stronger than in the July 
Tealbook over the next year and a half.  This upward revision primarily reflects policy developments since the July Tealbook, which have reduced financial tensions and suggest that European policymakers could act somewhat earlier and more proactively to resolve the crisis than we had previously anticipated .  (See the box “Recent Developments in the 
Euro Area .”)  Most importantly , ECB President Mario Draghi has  indicated that the ECB 
is prepared to resume secondary-market purchases of peripheral sovereign debt, provided the governments first agree to  policy conditional ity sufficient to allow the European 
financial rescue facilities  to join in the support .  In addition, leaders in Spain and Italy 
have signaled that they would consider requesting external assistance. 
In the coming months, we anticipate that markets  will r emain volatile and may 
well give back some of their recent gains as debates on the scope and implementation of 
the ECB ’s bond purchase strategy continue, Spain and Italy struggle  to meet fiscal 
targets,  and negotiations heat up  between Greece and its official creditors on the 
country’s adjustment program.  However, we now expect European authorities to provide assistance with more limited conditionality and , thus, less stigma than was the case in 
previous rescue programs.  Accordingly, we expect Spain (and perhaps Italy) to more 
readily request assistance in response to a heightening of financial pressures, thereby

 Recent Developments  in the Euro Area 
Lately, financial stresses in the euro area have lessened amid  expectations  of more forceful 
action by the European  Central Bank  (ECB), of progress toward  a European banking  union, 
and of more constructive negotiations  between Greece and  its official creditors.  However, 
plans for ECB operations  and the banking union have yet to be fleshed out.  In addition,  the 
permanent European  financial backstop  is still not operational,  leaving financial markets 
vulnerable  to negative developments.    
 
An important  factor contributing  to the easing of  financial tensions  since late July  has been 
the expectation that  the ECB will again intervene in  sovereign  debt markets.  ECB  President  
Draghi stated in a speech on  July 26 that “within our  mandate,  the ECB is ready to do 
whatever  it takes to preserve  the euro.”1  In the week following  this speech, Italian and  
Spanish 2 ‐year sovereign yields declined  about 120 basis points and 150 basis  points, 
respectively  (see figures  on the following page).  
 
On August 2, after a meeting  of the ECB Governing  Council, President  Draghi offered the 
broad outlines of a new intervention  framework.   The ECB  might purchase sovereign  debt in 
secondary  markets, but only  if the beneficiary  government  first obtains a financial  assistance 
program from the European  Financial  Stability Facility (EFSF) or the European  Stability 
Mechanism  (ESM), submits to “strict  and effective  conditionality”  and policy monitoring  
under this program,  and adheres to its policy commitments.   President  Draghi also noted 
that the ECB’s purchases  of sovereign  debt will focus  on the shorter end of the yield curve.  
In addition,  he suggested  that the ECB will divulge  the country breakdown  as well as the 
aggregate amount  of its bond purchases.   Finally, the ECB will address  concerns  about its 
seniority vis‐à‐vis private creditors, which  is viewed as damping  investor interest in sovereign  
debt.    
 
However,  it  remains unclear whether  intervention will aim  (implicitly  if not explicitly) to cap  
spreads or yields and  how much the ECB  will be willing to purchase to achieve its  aims.   The 
extent of  policy conditionality  and monitoring  required  is also unclear.  Some ECB officials 
might prefer stricter  conditionality  in order to mitigate  moral hazard, but that would  also 
increase stigma  and thus make the Italian and  Spanish governments  less likely  to request 
assistance.   At present,  these governments  are awaiting  further clarity on the terms and 
preconditions  for EFSF–ESM financial  assistance and  ECB intervention.   Negotiations  over 
these issues  are likely to drag on for some  time and could be more complicated  if the 
German Constitutional  Court determines  the law authorizing  Germany’s  participation  in the 
ESM to be unconstitutional  (a provisional  ruling is expected  on September  12).  Were these 
negotiations  to break down so that chances of ECB intervention dwindled, that  would likely 
substantially  disrupt financial markets.  
 In addition to considering  requesting  general financial support from  the EFSF or ESM, Spain 
is also implementing  its existing EFSF–ESM program  to recapitalize  its banks.  On  August 31, 
Spain approved  a new law that strengthens  its bank restructuring  and resolution  framework  
and establishes  a “bad bank” to be a repository  of troubled  assets.   Also, one of Spain’s

largest banks, BFA ‐Bankia, revealed  larger‐than‐expected  losses, immediately  prompting  the 
Spanish government to announce  a bridge recapitalization  pending a more comprehensive 
resolution  of BFA‐Bankia’s problems.  It  remains uncertain how  the costs of restructuring  
BFA‐Bankia and  other banks will be shared among private shareholders, creditors, and  the 
Spanish government.  
 
With vulnerable  euro‐area  banks in the spotlight,  markets are anticipating  the European  
Commission’s  proposal  for a European  banking union (expected  in mid‐September).   A single 
supervisory  mechanism  for European  banks is a prerequisite  for the ESM  to directly  
recapitalize  euro‐area banks  (at present,  the EFSF and ESM can  only recapitalize  banks 
indirectly  via loans to governments,  which further increase sovereign  debt burdens)  and is 
also expected  to precede  the creation  of euro‐area–wide  deposit insurance  and bank 
resolution  funds.  European authorities  envision a centralized  supervisory  structure where  
the ECB will have  the necessary  powers for supervising  euro‐area banks but will delegate 
day‐to‐day financial supervision to national  authorities  and relevant  agencies.   European 
officials hope that  establishment  of the supervisory  mechanism  can begin  in January 2013, 
but there is  significant  uncertainty  regarding  the implementation  and timing of this initiative.    
 
Finally, investor concerns  about Greece have moderated  recently as the near‐term prospects  
for Greece’s  financial assistance program  have improved.  The new  Greek government  has 
been working  to reinvigorate the austerity  and reform initiatives  that stalled before 
elections  this spring, and Greece’s  official creditors  appear willing to provide  some time for 
these efforts  to bear fruit.   In early August, the ECB increased  the amount of Greek Treasury  
bills the Bank of Greece can accept as collateral  in exchange  for emergency  liquidity 
assistance loans.  This  increase enabled  the Greek government  to sell additional  bills to the 
country’s  banks and to use the proceeds  to redeem  €3.2 billion of maturing  bonds owned 
primarily by the ECB.  Provided  the Greek government  continues  to make progress, we  
expect its official creditors  to approve  another long‐delayed disbursement  of EFSF and IMF 
funds in October.   More generally,  we expect European  policymakers  to defer for some  time 
the more difficult decisions  regarding  Greece (such as whether  to expand Greece’s  package 
of financial assistance).   However,  the longer‐term prospects  for Greece’s  program  and euro‐
area membership  remain highly uncertain.

  leading any deterioration in financial conditions to be smaller and less persistent than we 
assumed in the July Tealbook. 
By next year, we assume financial stresses will start to ease on a more sustained 
basis, but this assumption depends on further progress in other areas of Europe’s policy 
agenda.   We anticipate that Greece and its official creditors will reach agreement that 
unlocks the next aid  disbursement some time this fall, thereby providing European 
leaders with some breathing room to strengthen the backstops against a Greek exit .  
European leaders will likely further advance their plans for fiscal and financial union.  
Finally, peripheral governments will continue to implement budget cuts and structural reforms.  However, progress in all of these areas will be difficult and slow, and so strains will remain elevated for a considerable period.  
We expect euro -area inflation to rise to 2¼ percent in the third quarter from about 
2 percent in the second quarter, boosted in part by rising energy prices.  Against a backdrop of weak growth throughout the forecast horizon, we expect inflation to fall to 1½ percent in 2013 and 2014.  This path is roughly unchanged from that in the July Tealbook. 
At its August meeting, the ECB left its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 
0.75 percent, signaled readiness to use further nonstandard policy measures, and began to define a framework for intervention in secondary bond markets.  We still expect the ECB to further enhance its liquidity support to banks and to reduce its main policy rate to 
0.5 percent in the near term, possibly as early as at its September 6 meeting . 
United Kingdom 
The U.K. economy shrank 1.8 percent  at an annual rate in the second quarter , the 
third consecutive quarterly decline.  Temporary factors, including the loss of a working 
day during  the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, contributed to the contraction in the second 
quarter, but ongoing fiscal cons olidation and negative spillovers from the euro- area crisis 
are also restraining economic activity.   Moreover, survey indicators point to further 
weakness in the near term.  Notably, the manufacturing PMI remained in contractionary territory and confidence indicators stood at low levels through August.  Accordingly, 
despite the upward revision to the euro-area outlook, we marked down U.K. GDP growth 
a bit over the forecast period.  We now see the U.K. economy expanding at a modest

  1¼ percent  average rate in  the second half of 2012 , partly because of a temporary boost 
from  the Olympics , before picking up to 2¼ percent by  2014. 
After having dipped from 2 percent in the first quarter to 1.1 percent in the 
second, w e expect U.K. inflation to rise to slightly abo ve 3 percent in the second half of 
this year , boosted by the recent rise in oil prices and a planned increase in tuition fees.  
Thereafter, i nflation should settle just below 1¾ percent , restrained by ample resource 
slack.  Given the economy’s slower g rowth prospects, we expect the BOE  to increase its 
quantitative easing program by £50 billion to £425 billion (28 percent of GDP)  this fall, 
£25 billion more than assumed in the July Tealbook.  Monetary policy conditions should 
remain exceptionally accommodati ve, with no asset sales or hikes in the Bank Rate from 
its current level of 0.5 percent expected over the forecast period . 
Japan 
Japanese real GDP growth slowed from 5.5 percent in the first quarter to 
1.4 percent in the second .  This slowdown, which refle cted softer exports and private 
consumption, was nearly 1 percentage point sharper  than we had anticipated .  The  effect 
of the fiscal stimulus that had boosted growth in the first half of the year is  rapidly fading, 
and recent economic indicators have been  decidedly weaker than we had expected .  In 
July, retail sales, exports, and industrial production dropped sharply, and in August, the manufacturing PMI fell to its lowest level since the aftermath of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.  Thus, we revised down our forecast of third-quarter growth to 
negative ½ percent.   Japanese GDP should start growing again beginning next quarter 
and accelerate to a 1½  percent pace by the end of 2013, supported by the recent 
depreciation of the yen and a gradual recovery of the global economy.  In 2014, we 
expect growth to slow to ¾ percent in response to the planned consumption tax hike. 
Japanese consumer prices declined 1 percent in the second quarter , largely 
reflecting a drop in retail food prices.  Core prices , howe ver, were little changed, 
suggesting that Japan continued to slowly exit from deflation.  We now expect  consumer 
prices to be about flat in 2013 before rising 1¾ percent in 2014, boosted by the 3 percentage point hike in the consumption tax rate.  The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept policy on hold at its August meeting.  However , amid persistent output slack and inflation 
that remains below their 1  percent goal , we continue to assume that the BOJ will expand 
its asset purchase program by a further ¥20 trillion (ab out 4 percent of GDP) starting later 
this year .

  Canada 
Canada’s real GDP rose 1¾ percent in the second quarter, about the same pace as 
in the previous two quarters, and in line with our previous forecast.  Recent data are a 
touch weaker than we had expected.  Retail sales ebbed in June.  In July, the unemployment rate inched up to 7.3 percent, while the manufacturing PMI slipped a bit 
but remained in expansionary territory.  Accordingly, we marked down Canadian GDP 
growth slightly in the second half of this year, to 1¾ percent.  We continue to see GDP expanding at about 2 percent in 2013, with growth picking up to 2½ percent in 2014 as global economic conditions improve. 
Canadian consumer prices unexpectedly fell for the third straight month in July, 
led by declines in the prices of energy, clothing, and footwear , driving our forecast for 
third -quarter inflation down into negative territory.  Next quarter, we project that the 
pass-through of the recent oil prices increases will push up inflation to 2½ percent, 
½ percentage point higher than in the July Tealbook.  Thereafter, our inflation forecast is little changed near 2 percent in 2013 and 2014.  Given modest inflation prospects , we 
anticipate, as in the previous Tealbook, that the Bank of Canada will keep  its target for 
the overnight rate at 1 percent u ntil mid -2014. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
With nearly all of the real GDP data in hand, we now estimate that growth in the 
emerging market economies ( EMEs ) slowed to an annual rate of 4 percent in the second 
quarter, a little below our estimate of trend growth , and about in line with our July 
Tealbook forecas t.  Indicators for the third quarter are generally coming in somewhat 
weaker than we had expected, including in China, with exports showing particular weakn ess.  Mexico is an important exception, with overall third -quarter indicators, 
including the PMI and consumer confidence, continuing to show surprising strength.  All told, we project economic activity in the EMEs to continue expand ing at about a 
4 percent  pace in the second half of this year, down slightly from the July Tealbook, with 
somewhat faster -than-anticipated economic growth in Mexico (which has a high weight 
in our EME aggregate) partially  offsetting  slower -than-expected growth in most other 
count ries. 
Looking further ahead, real GDP growth in the EMEs is expected to pick up to 
about 4¾ percent by 2014, supported by the end of the recession in Europe and an acceleration of the recovery in the United States.  This forecast is a touch higher than in

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  the July Tealbook, primarily reflecting an upward revision to Mexican growth based on a 
more upbeat outlook for U.S. manufacturing production.  However, as we have 
highlighted in the past several Tealbooks, there are a number of important downside risks to the outlook for the EMEs, including a significant deterioration of the situation in 
Europe, a sharp slowing of the U.S. economy, and a hard landing in China. 
We project  that headline inflation in the EMEs slowed from 3 percent in the 
second quarter to 2¾ percent in the third quarter, with a decline in infla tion in Asia  more 
than offsetting an increase in Latin America.  We expect aggregate EME inflation to rise to 3¼ percent  in the fourth quarter and remain at about that rate thereafter.  This 
projection is a little higher over the next quarter than in the previous Tealbook, owing mainly to recent increases in oil prices, but is little changed thereafter.  Since the previous Tealbook, the central banks of Brazil, Colombia, and the Philippines have lowered 
monetary policy rates, and we continue to expect some additional policy easing in China, 
India, and South Korea over the next few months. 
China  
Chinese data since the July Tealbook have been a bit weaker than we had 
anticipated.  Retail sales and investment  growth held up in July, but exports were quite 
weak and the August official PMI dipped to 49.2, the first reading below 50  since late last 
year.  Consequently, we now project that real GDP  growth  in the second half of this year 
will remain subdued (by Chi nese standards) at the second -quar ter pace of 7½  percent, 
about ¼ percentage point slower than in the July Tealbook.  Output growth should then 
strengthen to a rate of 8¼  percent by the end of 2014, supported by monetary and fiscal 
policy stimulus and a gr adual improvement in global demand.  Although the elevated 
level of housing prices, along with substantial vacant floor space, continues to pose the risk of a sharp fall in Chinese growth, there has been little recent evidence that such a bust is in train,  and the authorities continue to have the fiscal and monetary scope to 
support demand in such an event. 
Chinese consumer price inflation fell a bit more than expected in July, as 
domestic food price inflation continued to retrace its increases earlier in the year .  
Accordingly, we now project a headline inflation rate of just 1¼ percent at an annual rate in the current quarter , ½ percentage point less than in the previous Tealbook.  With food 
price inflation bottoming out and oil prices having risen, inflation will likely increase to 
2¾ percent next quarter .  We project it to edge up further to 3 percent by 2014 as

  economic activity accelerates and wage growth remains strong.   Amid relatively subdued 
inflation and near -term concern s about economic growth,  Chinese authorities are 
expected to announce some additional monetary and fiscal accommodation in the coming 
quarters.  
Other Emerging Asia 
Second -quarter GDP data indicate  that activity in the rest of emerging Asia  
decelerated to about 3½ percent at an annua l rate, ¼ percentage point below our July 
Tealbook projection and well below its trend pace.  We would have expected a rebound from this low growth in the near term, but indicators for the third quarter have surprised  
on the downside, particularly exports.  Accordingly, we marked down real GDP growth 
in the region, which is now expected to remain at 3½ percent in the second half of this year.  Further out , growth is projected to rise  to 4¾ percent in 2014, supported by 
accommodative policies and the firming  of global economic activity. 
We project that headline inflation in the region will slow to 2½ percent at an 
annual rate in the current quarter —about ¾ percentage point below our forecast in the 
July Tealbook—refl ecting mainly a dip in food price inflation .  Next quarter, food price 
inflation is expected to rebound, which, along with the recent increases in oil crude oil prices, should push up overall inflation to 3½ percent.   Thereafter,  inflation is expected to 
average about 3¼ percent , little changed fro m the previous forecast . 
Latin America 
In Mexico, real GDP growth slowed in the second quarter to an annual rate of 
3½ percent from almost 5 percent in the first quarter.  The decline was less than we had 
expected in the July Tealbook, partly reflecting su rprising strength in the services sector.  
The moderation in U.S. manufacturing growth from earlier this year , along with recent 
Mexican data, point to some further decline in growth  this quarter and next.  Although 
manufacturing PMI rose to 55 in August, exports in July picked up only a bit from their weak June level.  We project that Mexican economic growth will average 3¼ percent in 
the second half of this year before edging up to just above 3½ percent in 2014, as the trajectory of U.S. manufacturing output picks up.  Relative to the July Tealbook, this 
projection is up ½ percentage point over the forecast period, largely reflecting an upward 
revision to the outlook for U.S. manufacturing production.

  For South America, real GDP growth slowed to 2½  percent  in the second quarter 
from 3 percent in the first, primarily reflecting a sharp decline in Venezuelan growth.  In 
the third quarter, we project the region’s output will rise 2¾  percent as Venezuelan 
growth rebounds and economic activity picks up in Brazil.  Going forward, South 
American real GDP growth should pick up further to about 4 percent by t he end of the 
forecast period. 
After a meager performance in the second half of last year and early this year, 
Brazilian real GDP growth picked up to 1½ percent in the second quarter, a bit below our July Tealbook forecast .  Growth was supported by robust domestic demand, notably 
consumption, which more than offset a sharp contraction in exports.  The second -quarter 
performance suggests that the stimulative policies enacted earlier are finally beginning to 
have some effect.   Going forward, these policies , along with the gradual recovery in the 
advanced economies, should help lift growth to slightly above 4 percent by the end of the 2014.  In mid -August, Brazil’s go vernment announced an infrastructure spending 
program amounting on average to about ¼ percent of GDP over the next five  years .  In 
late August, the central bank again cut its policy rate 50 basis points to a new historic low of 7.5 percent.  
Mexican inflati on has been increasing since May, reflecting in part rising food 
prices related to the drought in North America.  We now project that Mexican headline consumer prices in the third quarter will increase at an annual rate of 5¼ percent, up from 2½ percent in  the second quarter and about ½ percentage point above our forecast in the 
July Tealbook.  As food price pressures abate, however, we expect Mexican inflation to 
average about 3¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast period.  Rising domestic 
food prices have also pushed up inflation in  Brazil.  We project Brazilian inflation will 
reach 6  percent in the current quarter, dip to 5 percent in the fourth quarter as food price 
inflation  subsides, and then average about 5½ percent over the remainder of the forecast 
period.

Financial Developments 
Sentiment in domestic financial market s improved a bit, on balance, over the 
intermeeting period, reflecting generally better-than-expected domestic economic data 
releases, somewhat-reduced concerns about the situation in Europe, and expectations of 
more-accommodative monetary policy.  Broad i ndexes of U.S. equity prices rose about 
2 percent, near-term option-im plied volatility on the S&P 500  index decreased a little, 
spreads on corporate bonds narrowed slight ly, and unsecured shor t-term dollar funding 
markets remained stable. 
The expected path of the federal funds  rate moved up early in the period in 
response to the August FOMC statement and subsequent economic data releases that 
came in above market expectations.  However,  the release of the minutes of the August 
FOMC meeting and the Chairman’s recen t speech at the Jackson Hole economic 
symposium reportedly caused market particip ants to mark up their expectations of 
additional monetary policy accommodation.  On net over the intermeeting period, the expected path of the federal funds rate edged down.  Yields on  short-dated nominal 
Treasury securities were little changed, while longer-dated Treasury yields increased a 
bit.  Measures of inflation compensation ove r the next five years moved up, consistent 
with rises in the prices of some key commodities.   
Sentiment also improved somewhat in foreign markets, as the ECB discussed the 
broad outlines of a plan to make additiona l sovereign-bond purchase s in conjunction with 
the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism.  Spreads 
of yields on peripheral euro-area sovereign bond s declined over the period compared with 
those on comparable-maturity German bunds, particularly at shorter maturities.  
European benchmark equity indexes moved up, and European bank equity prices rose 
sharply.  The broad index of the foreign ex change value of the dollar decreased.   
On the whole, financing flows in the Un ited States remained strong in recent 
months, particularly for the nonfinancial  corporate sector.  Investment- and  
speculative-grade corporate bond issuance in creased in August from already robust 
levels, and commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to grow briskly.  In the 
household sector, nonrevolving consumer credit  again expanded significantly in the 
second quarter, but the growth of revolvi ng credit remained subdued.  Mortgage

  refinancing activity edged up in August as in terest rates stayed low, but conventional 
mortgages remained difficult to obtain fo r households with less-than-pristine credit 
scores.  
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Rates on money market futures and Treasury yields both moved up notably 
following the August FOMC statement, reporte dly because investors had put some odds 
on a change in the forward-guidance language that would push back the anticipated date 
of liftoff for the federal funds rate.  Intere st rates increased further in the following 
weeks, reflecting reduced inve stor concerns about the cris is in Europe and domestic 
economic data releases that were read by mark et participants as somewhat better than 
expected.  In contrast, the tone of the A ugust FOMC minutes was viewed as somewhat 
more accommodative than anticipated and led to some declines in futures rates and 
Treasury yields.  Subsequently, the Chai rman’s August 31 speech at the economic 
symposium in Jackson Hole apparently rein forced expectations of additional policy 
action. 
On net over the intermeeting period, the ne ar-term expected pa th of the federal 
funds rate derived from OIS rates was little changed, but the path edged down a few basis 
points beyond mid-2015.  The expected policy pa th now first rises to levels above the 
current target range between the third and fourth quarters of 2014, slig htly later than at 
the time of the August FOMC meeting.  Th e estimated modal policy path—the most 
likely values for future federal funds rates as  derived from interest rate caps—remained 
within the current target range  until the second quarter of 2016.1     
Results from the Open Market Desk’s latest survey of primary dealers also 
showed a downward shift in medium-term po licy rate expectations, with the median 
target federal funds rate forecasts for the first half of 2015 declining nearly 40 basis 
points since the time of the August survey.  Dealers now view the third quarter of 2015 as 
the most likely time of the first increase in the target rate, two quarters later than in the 
August survey.  In addition, dealers revised up the probability that  the FOMC will extend 
the period of its forward rate guidance at  the upcoming meeting from 40 percent to 
75 percent and the probability that the FO MC will announce additional asset purchases 
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 13 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.

  from 25 percent to 55 percent compared with the August survey, but continued to attach 
low odds to a reduction in the rate  of interest on excess reserves. 
Nominal Treasury yields also increased a l ittle, on net, particularly at longer 
maturities, and the yield curve steepened a b it, with 2-year yields about unchanged and 
10- to 30-year yields increasi ng about 8 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively.  
The TIPS-based 5-year measure of inflati on compensation increased 10 basis points, on 
net, over the intermeeting period, while the forward measure of inflation compensation 
for the next 5 years edged down.  The increase in the 5-year measure is consistent with 
the recent rise in the prices of oil and so me other commodities.  Swaps- and caps-based 
measures of inflation compensati on showed similar patterns.   
The Desk’s outright purchases and sales of Treasury securities under the maturity 
extension program, as well as reinvestment of principal payments from its holdings of 
agency securities, continued to proceed as  planned and did not appear to have any 
material adverse effect on market functioning.2  Most measures of liquidity conditions in 
Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets remained stable over the 
intermeeting period.3 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Foreign financial conditions have impr oved since the August FOMC meeting.  
Investors were reassured by a statement E CB President Draghi delivered a few days 
before the August FOMC meeting that the E CB was “ready to do whatever it takes to 
preserve the euro.”4  Following the ECB policy meeting on August 2, President Draghi 
                                                 
2 The Federal Reserve purchased $50 billion, sold $39 billion, and redeemed $12 billion of 
Treasury securities over the intermeeting period un der the maturity extension program; the average 
maturity of SOMA Treasury holdings has lengthened by about 3½ years since the beginning of the program 
last September.  In addition, the Federal Reserv e reinvested $31 billion in agency mortgage-backed 
securities from principal payments from  its holdings of agency securities. 
3 MBS yields showed little reaction to the announ ced changes to the Preferred Stock Purchase 
Agreements (“keepwell” agreements) between the Tr easury Department and Fa nnie Mae and Freddie Mac 
in mid-August.  Under the new terms, the 10 percent dividend payment that the GSEs made to the Treasury each year is replaced with a quarterly sweep of all GSE profits.  With the expira tion of the unlimited capital 
support provisions of the keepwell agreements at the end of this year, Fannie Mae has $125 billion in 
capital support remaining after 2012, whereas Freddie Mac has $149 billion in capital support remaining.  
The elimination of the 10 percent dividend after 2012 makes additional capital injections from the Treasury less likely.  
4 Mario Draghi (2012), “Verbatim of the Remarks Made by Mario Draghi,” speech delivered at 
the Global Investment Conference, London, July 26, www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2012/html/sp120726.en.html.

  reported that the ECB was considering possibl e measures to ease policy and offered a 
broad outline of a plan for the ECB to make  secondary-market purch ases of short-term 
sovereign debt of countries that had reached  an agreement for fiscal support from the 
European Financial Stability Facility or the European Stability Mechanism.  Spreads of 
yields on two-year Spanish and Italian sove reign debt over German bunds have declined 
about 230 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, sin ce the FOMC meeting, while 
longer-term spreads have declined more modestly.  Negotiations over further aid 
continued between the Greek government a nd the European Union, the ECB, and the 
IMF as Greece sought additional time to meet its fiscal goals.  Amid mounting 
expectations that Greece’s creditors will postpone difficult decisions for some time,  
10-year Greek yields declined about 350 basis points over the pe riod to near 22 percent.   
Consistent with the improved risk sen timent, funding conditions for euro-area 
banks eased, though funding conditions remained fragile.  A few of the larger euro-area 
banks that had been out of the unsecured debt markets were able to return in recent weeks 
as market conditions improved.  The spread  between three-month EURIBOR and the OIS 
rate narrowed roughly 10 basis points, and the three-month euro–dollar implied basis 
spread also narrowed about 10 ba sis points to less than 20 basis points, its lowest level 
since June 2011.  Dollar borrowings at the ECB’ s liquidity swap facility with the Federal 
Reserve fell about $12 billion to near $19 b illion.  In the United Kingdom, sterling 
LIBOR–OIS spreads and bank lending rates ha ve also declined, which Bank of England 
(BOE) officials attribute to the recent in troduction of the BOE’s Funding for Lending 
Scheme.  
Headline equity indexes are up 4 percent in the euro area, while shares in  
euro-area banks have risen 15 percent si nce the August FOMC meeting and about  
35 percent from their trough in late July, de spite second-quarter earnings reports that 
continue to come in very weak.  This impr oved sentiment appeared to spill over to stock 
markets in other advanced foreign economies :  Stock prices in Japan and the United 
Kingdom also rose modestly.  However, Ch ina’s Shanghai composite index declined  
3 percent, on net, reaching its lowest level since 2009, as investor s continued to worry 
about a further slowdown of the Chinese ec onomy.  Equity prices in other emerging 
market countries were mixed, but emerging market sovereign CDS spreads decreased 
modestly, consistent with the globa l improvement in risk sentiment.

  The staff’s broad nominal index of the exchange value of the dollar ended the 
period ⅔ percent lower.  The dollar depreciated against most major currencies except the 
yen, as improved market sentiment led to a reversal of some flight-t o-safety flows.  The 
dollar also declined against the Mexican peso and Brazilian real but was relatively little 
changed against most currencies in emerging As ian markets.  In addition to the reversal 
of flight-to-safety flows, th e release of the FOMC minutes  also led to some modest 
downward pressure on the dollar.  Ten-year so vereign yields in Germany and the United 
Kingdom, which had risen earlier in the peri od on improved risk sentiment, declined 
along with U.S. Treasury yields after the release of the FOMC minutes.   
Recent TIC data indicate that private fo reign investors continued to buy Treasury 
securities in July, at roughly the same pace as in the second quarter.  Foreign private 
appetite for U.S. corporate securities rebounded so mewhat in July as investors returned to 
net purchases of U.S. equities while selling fewer U.S. corporate bonds .  Foreign official 
investors also continued to ac quire Treasury securities in July, at about the pace seen 
since the beginning of the year.  More-recent data on custody holdings at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York indicate fu rther official inflows in August. 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
Equity prices for large domestic ba nks rose roughly 5 percent over the 
intermeeting period, and CDS spreads for the largest bank holding companies continued 
to move down.  Even so, for a number of institutions, these spreads remained in the 
elevated ranges seen since the summer of  2011.  Conditions in unsecured short-term 
dollar funding markets remained stable.  LIBO R–OIS spreads and the spread between the 
three-month forward rate agreement and th e OIS rate three to six months ahead—a 
forward-looking measure of potential funding pressures—were about unchanged on net.  
Market participants continued to report tier ing among European institutions in unsecured 
dollar funding markets, and sugge sted also that higher-quality names have recently been 
able to obtain funding at some what longer terms.      
The average maturity of unsecured financ ial commercial paper (CP) issued by 
institutions with European parents as well as that issued by institutions with U.S. parents 
lengthened somewhat over the period.  Even  so, the average maturity of unsecured 
financial CP issued by institutions with Eur opean parents remained lower than that for 
institutions with U.S. parents.  The spreads of yields on highly rated unsecured CP issued

  by financial firms over yields on highly rated no nfinancial issues were little changed at 
low levels. 
Conditions in secured funding markets we re generally little changed over the 
intermeeting period.  In the triparty mark et, volumes ticked up, reflecting increased 
activity across a range of collateral types, while Treasury general collateral finance 
repurchase agreement (GCF repo) rates were  roughly unchanged on balance.  Data on 
recently introduced futures contracts tie d to the DTCC Treasury GCF Repo Index 
indicate that market partic ipants expect repo rates to remain in the neighborhood of 
20 basis points for the remainder of the year .  In the bilateral market, haircuts on  
non-OMO-eligible collateral re portedly narrowed a bit over th e period.  In asset-backed 
commercial paper (ABCP) markets, volumes  outstanding remained stable over the 
intermeeting period for programs with sponsors do miciled in the United States or Europe.  
However, the spreads of overnight yields on ABCP with European parents over yields on 
highly rated nonfinancial unsecured CP incr eased, while those on ABCP with U.S. 
parents were little changed.  Money market funds (MMFs) increase d their exposures to 
European counterparties a bit in July, mostly through government-security repo contracts.  
The direct exposures of U.S. MMFs to Europe remained sizable at $756 billion, including 
$326 billion in euro-zone holdings, dominated by French, German, and Dutch issuers. 
In response to the September 2012 Seni or Credit Officer Opinion Survey on 
Dealer Financing Terms, dealers indicated  that they had increased the amount of 
resources and attention devoted to the manage ment of concentrated exposures to dealers 
and other financial intermediaries as well as to central counterpartie s and other financial 
market utilities over the past three months, as they had in the previous surveys (see 
appendix).  Respondents generally  reported that there had been  no significant change in 
the terms applicable to OTC derivatives a nd securities financing transactions with 
important classes of counterparty types over the same period.  More oever, they cited no 
material changes over the past  three months in the use of  leverage by hedge funds or 
other important classes of institutional investor s, including REITs that invest in securities 
backed by real estate and insurance companie s.  Respondents did not e, however, greater 
demand for funding of agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities.

  concerns about Europe.  The staff’s estimate of the spread between the expected real 
equity return for the S&P 500 index and the r eal 10-year Treasury yield—a gauge of the 
equity premium—narrowed slightly but remained very wide by historical standards.  An 
index of option-implied one-month-ahead vola tility for the S&P 500 index, the VIX, fell 
in early August to levels not seen since mi d-2007 and ended the period a little lower on 
net.  However, option-implied volatility 12 months ahead moved up slightly and is 
somewhat more elevated relativ e to historical norms, sugges ting that market participants 
are less sanguine about risk s to equity market perfor mance over the medium term. 
The reporting season for second-quarter earnings drew to a close over the 
intermeeting period but did not leave a visible imprint on aggregate stock market prices.  
Although the majority of firms in the S&P 500 index reported earnings  that were higher 
than private-sector forecasts, many reported revenues that failed to meet expectations, 
reportedly prompting some concerns about gr owth going forward.  An index of revisions 
to analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead earn ings for S&P 500 firms remained modestly 
negative through the four-week peri od ending in mid-August.    
Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment- and speculative-grade 
corporate bonds were little changed at near-re cord-low levels.  The spread of yields on 
corporate bonds to those on comparable-m aturity Treasury secu rities edged down but 
remained elevated relative to  historical norms.  The spread s of yields on A2/P2 unsecured 
CP issued by nonfinancial firms over yields on A1/P1-rated issues were about flat on net. 
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Available indicators suggest that the credit quality of  nonfinancial corporations 
continued to be quite solid.  In the second quarter, the aggregate liquid asset ratio 
remained near its highest level in more than 20 years, while the aggregate ratio of debt to assets edged up but stayed well below its aver age over the past two decades.  Over July 
and August, the volume of nonfinancial  corporate bonds downgraded by Moody’s 
Investors Service exceeded the volume of  bonds upgraded, but the overall pace of 
downgrades was modest.  The six-month trai ling bond default rate fo r nonfinancial firms 
remained low in July, and the C&I loan deli nquency rate decreased further in the second 
quarter.  The expected year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms from the Moody’s 
KMV model edged down in August from  moderately elevated levels.

  Net debt issuance by nonfinancial firm s remained strong over the intermeeting 
period.  The pace of investment- and specu lative-grade bond issuance picked up notably 
in August from an already robust pace in Jul y.  Many nonfinancial i ssuers reported that 
they intended to use the proceeds to pay down other debt.  The volume of C&I loans 
outstanding increased further in August, while  the volume of nonfinancial CP outstanding 
was little changed on net.   
In the syndicated leveraged loan market, gross issuance of institutional loans 
reportedly remained solid in July and August following its strong pace in  the first half of 
the year—and contrary to expectations for a significant summer slowdown.  In addition, 
issuance of collateralized loan  obligations continued apace and remained on track to post 
its strongest year since 2007, reportedly supported by interest on the part of a wide range 
of institutional investors.  Secondary-market prices for leveraged loans were up a touch 
over the intermeeting period. 
The pace of gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms increased slightly 
but remained subdued in August.  The pace of equity retirements through cash-financed 
mergers by nonfinancial firms picked up so me in the second quarter, boosted by a 
handful of very large deals, and share repur chases continued to be robust, leaving net 
equity issuance deeply negative through the second quarter.  However, announcements of 
new mergers and share repurchase programs sugg est that the pace of equity retirements 
will likely moderate over the rest of the year. 
Financial conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) market remained 
somewhat strained against a backdrop of  weak fundamentals and tight underwriting 
standards.  Prices for CRE properties conti nued to fluctuate at lo w levels through June 
amid elevated vacancy and delinquency rates.   Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed 
securities remained solid in July and August, albeit well be low levels in the few years 
prior to the financial crisis. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
While current-coupon MBS yields rose m oderately over the intermeeting period, 
mortgage rates were little changed, on net, at  very low levels, with the interest rate on  
30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages hovering around 3½ percent.  Even so, 
mortgage originations for home purchase have been about flat.  Refinance originations 
increased in August but remained muted rela tive to the predicti on of staff models,

  reflecting tight underwriting condi tions, consolidation in the mo rtgage origination sector, 
and low levels of home equity. 
Aggregate indexes of house prices continued to increase, with the CoreLogic 
index increasing for the seventh consecutive month in July.  This index is now roughly 
4 percent higher than its year- earlier value and almost 5½ per cent higher than its low at 
the end of last year.  Although the rate at  which mortgages are entering delinquency has 
been trending down, likely reflecting the tight underwriting co nditions that have 
prevailed for the past few years, the fracti on of existing mortgages that are seriously 
delinquent remains very elevated. 
Nonrevolving credit continued to grow br iskly in June, owing to robust growth in 
student loans originated by the federal governme nt and, to a lesser extent, solid growth in 
auto loans made by private lenders.  In cont rast, the surge in revolving credit in May was 
partly reversed in June, leav ing growth in the second quarter  overall near zero.  Data on 
mail solicitations suggest that growth in revo lving credit will remain subdued in the near 
term.  Delinquency rates for consumer credit st ayed low, especially for revolving credit, 
largely due to a compositional shift of cr edit supply toward higher-credit-quality 
borrowers.  Issuance of consumer ABS in July  exceeded the elevated rate observed in the 
second quarter but declined somewhat in A ugust, partly reflecting seasonal patterns. 
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Since the August FOMC meeting, the Tr easury has auctioned $171 billion in 
nominal securities and $14 billion in 5-year  TIPS.  The auctions were generally well 
received, with bid-to-cover ratios close to thei r recent averages and indirect bidding 
ratios, with the exception of the 30-year  bond, slightly below their recent averages. 
Gross issuance of long-te rm municipal bonds picked  up in August from its 
somewhat subdued pace in July, but net issu ance of long-term bonds remained negative, 
reflecting outsized bond retirements by state and local governments.  The number of 
municipal bonds downgraded by Moody’s increased in the second quarter to its highest 
quarterly reading in over 10 years, partly reflecting downgrades of  a large number of 
bonds from the recently dissolved redevelopmen t authorities in California; the number of 
upgrades was relatively modest .  However, default rates on municipal bonds remained 
very low.  In addition, CDS spreads for stat es moved lower over the intermeeting period,

comparable-maturity Treasury securities decreased on net.  
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit grew at about the same mode rate pace over July and August as it had 
over the first half of the year.  Growth in total loans remained sluggish, reflecting 
offsetting developments within major loan ca tegories.  C&I loans continued to increase 
briskly, but CRE and home equity loan s remained on a downtrend.  Closed-end 
residential mortgages grew only modestly, despite historically  low mortgage rates, held 
down in part by robust sales to the GSEs.  Cons umer loans were about flat as credit card 
loans declined and other consumer loans continued to increase.  Noncore loans have 
slowed of late, mainly refl ecting reduced repo activity w ith nonbanks.  Banks’ holdings 
of securities expanded rapidly in July and August, mainly becaus e of one large bank’s 
acquisition of a sizable amount of Treasury securities in early  July.  On the funding side, 
domestic banks generally continued to experi ence inflows of core deposits while they 
reduced their managed liabilities.  (S ee the box “Bank Funding Consultations.”) 
According to the Survey of Terms of Business Lending that was conducted in 
August, spreads on C&I loans were  little changed, as a furthe r slight reduction in spreads 
at domestic banks was largely offset by hi gher spreads on loans originated by U.S. 
branches and agencies of foreign banks.  In  addition, the average maturity of C&I loans 
originated during the survey week remained at a level that is considerably higher than its 
pre-recession peak. 
Call Report data and bank holding company filings indicated that profitability 
measures at domestic banking institutions were  little changed in the second quarter.  The 
industry-wide return on assets ticked up but remained below its average in the decade 
prior to the financial crisis.  Low net inte rest margins and stagnant noninterest income 
again depressed aggregate net income.  The ra te of loan loss provi sioning continued to 
decline from its 2009 peak but appears to have stabilized in recent quart ers at a level that 
is a bit above its pre-crisis average.  Measures of credit quality generally improved further in the second quarter, as delinquency and charge-off rates declined for all loan 
categories except for residential real estate .  While loans outstanding grew modestly, 
unused commitments to fund loans contra cted, leaving the sum of the two—banks’ 
aggregate lending capacity—about flat.  Aggreg ate regulatory capital ratios remained 
near their recent highs.

 Bank Funding Consultations  
In mid‐ August, the Federal  Reserve System conducted  an informal  survey on special topics 
regarding  bank funding conditions  with nine  banks, mostly  very large  institutions.   The 
survey asked  banks about their likely reaction to the expiration at the  end of 2012 of 
unlimited  insurance  on noninterest ‐bearing transaction  deposits  under the Dodd–Frank  Wall 
Street Reform  and Consumer  Protection  Act of 2010 (Dodd–Frank  Act) and  the maturation  
of long‐term debt issued under the FDIC’s Temporary  Liquidity Guarantee  Program  (TLGP).1  
Overall, the  respondents  were not notably concerned  about the expiration  of either 
program at year‐end, generally  citing sufficient  access to low‐cost funding to meet 
anticipated  loan demand.    
Noninterest‐ bearing transaction  accounts  have been insured in unlimited  amounts  at all 
banks by the FDIC during 2011 and 2012, as provided  for in the Dodd– Frank Act.  Prior to that, 
the same insurance was  available  to banks  participating  in the Transaction Account 
Guarantee  Program  (a component  of the TLGP), but many banks opted out of that coverage 
during 2010.   Since the Dodd–Frank  insurance  came into effect on December  31, 2010, 
commercial  banks’ holdings  of deposits  covered by this insurance  have increased  56 percent 
(see the figure below), and as of the end of the second quarter of 2012, they accounted  for 
nearly 19½ percent of the industry’s  total domestic deposits,  up from about 14½ percent at 
the end of the fourth quarter  of 2010.  
 The survey  results suggest that the temporary  insurance  has not been the  only factor 
behind the rise in noninterest ‐bearing transaction  deposits  over the  past two years.   The 
respondents  unanimously  cited the importance of  depositors’ increased  preferences  for safe 
and liquid assets, while two‐thirds cited  the temporary  insurance.   Four banks also 
volunteered  that their customers  have large amounts  of cash and low opportunity  costs of  
 
       
                                                 
1 The consultations  also included a third set of questions  regarding  the Bank  of England’s  Funding  for 
Lending  Scheme;  see the memo  to be sent to the members  of the Board of Governors  and the presidents  of 
the Reserve Banks, “Discount  Window Options to Encourage  Bank  Lending.”

holding liquid assets of this sort.  Consistent  with the importance of  these non ‐insurance 
factors, the respondents  generally  did not expect to lose large amounts  of these deposits  
after the insurance expires  at the end  of this year.2  As a result, only  about half of the 
respondents  plan to take any steps to retain  insurance ‐related deposits,  mostly by marketing  
other banking services rather than by raising deposit interest rates or reducing  fees on 
deposit accounts.   
Of the six respondents  that viewed insurance  coverage  as an important factor  behind the 
inflows of these deposits, fi ve cited state and local governments  as responsible for an 
important  share of the insurance ‐related inflows.  Respondents  also indicated  that the 
insurance ‐related inflows came from large corporations  and to a lesser  extent from  
customers  that must invest exclusively  in government ‐guaranteed  investments.   
Finally, the  respondents  widely indicated  that the insurance ‐related inflows  of additional  
noninterest ‐bearing transaction  deposits  have not changed  their willingness  to originate 
new loans.  Consequently,  there is little to reason to believe  that the expiration  of this 
insurance  will cause these  banks to tighten  their lending standards  or terms. 
An important  caveat is that these results  may not be representative  of the funding situation  
at smaller banks.  In  partic ular, community  bank trade groups have argued that the unlimited  
insurance  on noninterest ‐bearing transaction  accounts has  been important  for those  
institutions’  ability to compete  with larger  banks for deposits, and  as a result these groups  
have been lobbying  for extending  the coverage  past year‐ end, though the chances for such 
an extension  remain uncertain.    
With respect  to long‐term debt, financial  institutions  issued debt guaranteed  by the FDIC 
between October 14,  2008, and October 31, 2009, through the  Debt Guarantee  Program, a 
part of the TLGP.  Much of  this debt has matured,  mostly in the past year, and  only a small 
amount is still outstanding,  all of which will mature  before the FDIC’s guarantee  expires on 
December  31, 2012.  Of the nine survey respondents,  six used the TLGP to issue long‐term 
debt (defined  here as debt with a duration  of at least one year).  Despite the maturation  of 
the debt issued under the TLGP, these respondents  reported  no plans to issue new long‐
term debt over the  remainder  of the year.  Two have already replaced  their maturing  long‐
term TLGP debt, and the others have decided not  to replace  it.  In deciding  to not issue new 
long‐term debt, three of  these four respondents  cited strategic goals  to reduce  the size of 
their balance  sheets.  In addition,  they also indicated  they had decided to replace  the 
maturing  debt, in part, with capital  or with other liabilities—largely  deposits,  particularly  in 
the form of wholesale noninterest ‐bearing transaction accounts.  
                                                 
2 A May 2012  survey of corporate  treasurers  by the Association  of Financial Professionals  suggests  a 
somewhat  larger scope for outflows  of these  deposits,  as about two‐ fifths  of those surveyed  reported  plans 
to make significant  reductions  in their noninterest ‐bearing transaction  deposits.   
In addition, two of the largest banks  expect to shed about  half of their insurance ‐related deposit 
inflows, consistent  with an overall strategy to shrink their balance  sheets.  Both of these banks  also

  M2 growth was rapid in July but slowed to a moderate pace in August.  Even so, 
the levels of M2 balances and of liquid deposits, the largest component of M2, remained 
elevated relative to what w ould be expected based on hist orical relationships with 
nominal income and opportunity costs.  Liqui d deposits increased at  an annual rate of 
13¼ percent in July, likely refl ecting investors’ desire to hol d safe and liquid assets amid 
concerns about the situation in Europe.  In August, as these concerns eased somewhat, 
the growth in liquid deposits fell to a bit less than half its July pace.  Currency grew at 
about its historical average pace in July and August, while retail MMF balances and 
small time deposits continued to decline.  The monetary base rose as reserve balances and currency expanded over the period.  The increase  in reserve balances was driven largely 
by a decrease in the Treasury’s Genera l Account.  (See the box “Balance Sheet 
Developments over the Intermeeting Period.”)

 Balance Sheet Developments  over the Intermeeting  Period 
Assets of the Federal Reserve  totaled $2,816 billion at the end  of the intermeeting  period, 
down $32 billion  from the time of the previous  meeting (see table  on next page). 
Since the August  FOMC meeting,  the Open Market Desk  at the Federal  Reserve Bank of 
New York (FRBNY)  conducted  22 operations  as part of the maturity  extension  program:  
The Desk purchased  $50 billion in Treasury  securities  with remaining  maturities  of 6 to 
30 years and sold or allowed to mature  without reinvestment $51  billion in Treasury  
securities  with maturities  of 3 years or less.1  Since the maturity extension  program  was 
announced  in September  2011, the  average maturity  of the Federal  Reserve’s Treasury  
holdings has risen from 6.1 years to 9.5 years.  In addition,  the Desk reinvested  $30 billion 
of agency debt and agency MBS principal  payments  in agency MBS securities.2 
Foreign central  bank liquidity swaps declined  moderately  to $23 billion.  The net portfolio 
holdings of Maiden Lane III LLC decreased  $6 billion,  as all remaining  securities  in the 
Maiden Lane  III portfolio were  sold on August 23.  The net portfolio  holdings of Maiden 
Lane LLC and Maiden Lane  II LLC were unchanged.   As part of the closeout  procedures  
for Maiden  Lane II, eight residual  securities,  which had already been marked  down to 
zero and dropped from  the Maiden Lane  II portfolio holdings  report, were  sold.  Loans  
outstanding  under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities  Loan Facility  continued  to decline. 
On the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet,  Federal  Reserve note s in 
circulation  increased  $14 billion, while reverse repurchase  agreements  with foreign  
official and international  accounts  rose slightly.  On August 16, as part of its operational  
readiness  program,  the FRBNY announced  updated  eligibility  requirements  for reverse  
repurchase agreement counterparties.3  The FRBNY  plans to conduct  small‐ value reverse  
repurchase agreement tests  in the near future.  The U.S.  Treasury’s  General Account,  
which is highly volatile from month to month, decreased  $60 billion, and other deposits,  
which include GSE balances,  were unchanged.4  Meanwhile,  reserve balances  of 
depository  institutions  increased  $17 billion.5  Term deposits  held by depository  
institutions  fell to zero,  as a $3 billion small‐ value operation of  the Term Deposit Facility 
matured on August 16, 2012.

Appendix 
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms 
For the most part, responses to the September 2012 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey 
on Dealer Financing Terms pointed to no significan t changes in the credit terms applicable to 
important classes of counterparties over the past three months, but a few dealers noted a slight 
easing for some counterparties.1  Continuing a pattern observed in previous surveys, large net 
fractions of respondents indicated an increase in the amount of resources and attention devoted to 
the management of concentrated exposures to deal ers and other financial intermediaries as well as 
to central counterparties and other financial mark et utilities.  Dealers reported that the use of 
financial leverage by hedge funds had remained basically unchanged over the past three months.  
Sizable net fractions of respondents also noted that the provision of differential terms to  
most-favored hedge funds and to trading real estate investment trusts (REITs) had increased over the past three months.
 2  For several types of counterparties, modest net fractions of dealers 
reported an increase in the intensity of efforts by  those counterparties to negotiate more-favorable 
price and nonprice terms. 
As in previous surveys, respondents indicated that most nonprice terms incorporated in 
new or renegotiated over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives master agreements were broadly unchanged, on balance, during the past three months.  Dealers also reported that initial margin requirements, which fall outside the scope of the master agreements, were  generally little changed 
over the same period.  About one-fifth of respondents indicated that the posting of nonstandard collateral (that is, other than cash and U.S.  Treasury securities) permitted under relevant 
agreements had increased somewhat.  
With regard to securities financing, surv ey respondents indicated that the terms 
applicable to the funding of types of securities included in the survey were generally little 
changed, on balance, over the past three months.  About two-fifths of dealers noted that demand 
for funding of non-agency residential mortgage -backed securities (RMBS) had increased, while 
about one-fourth of respondents reported an in crease in demand for funding of agency RMBS.  
Dealers also pointed to an increase in demand for term funding (that is, funding with a maturity of 
                                                 
1 The September survey collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three 
months in credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives 
markets.  In addition to the core set of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about trends 
in the types of assets posted as collateral agains t OTC derivatives transactions.  A discussion of the 
responses to the set of special questions will be provided in a separate memorandum.  The 22 institutions participating in the survey account for almost all of the dealer financing of dollar-denominated securities to 
nondealers and are the most active in termediaries in OTC derivatives markets.  The survey was conducted 
during the period from August 14, 2012, to August 27, 2012.  The core questions ask about changes 
between June 2012 and August 2012.

  30 days or more) for these collateral types.  In cont rast to the June survey, nearly two-fifths of 
survey respondents indicated that liquidity and functioning in the underlying markets for  
non-agency RMBS and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) had improved 
somewhat over the past three months.     
COUNTERPARTY TYPES  
Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries 
 In the September survey, about one-third of respondents indicated that they had 
increased the amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated 
exposures to dealers and other financial intermed iaries over the past three months.  Among the 
nine “broad-scope” dealers, which have a significant presence in essentially all of the business areas covered in the survey, a similar share reported increasing resources and attention to management of these concentrated exposures.  In the June survey, about one-half of respondents 
had reported such an increase.  These responses point  to continued elevated concerns about the 
condition of financial institutions, while the reduction in share since June also appears to reflect 
in part the recent apparent easing of anxiety about the crisis in Europe.   
Central Counterparties and Other Financial Utilities 
Nearly two-thirds of dealers indicated that they had increased the amount of resources 
and attention each of their firms devoted to management of concentrated credit exposure to central counterparties and other financial utiliti es over the past three months, roughly the same 
share as in the previous survey.  All but two of th e nine broad-scope dealers reported an increase.  
Of note, about one-fourth of all of the respondent s indicated that changes in the practices of 
central counterparties, including changes in marg in requirements and haircuts, had influenced to 
more than a minimal extent the credit terms the d ealer applied to clients on bilateral transactions 
that are not cleared. 
Hedge Funds 
Respondents to the September survey indicated  that both price terms (such as financing 
rates) and nonprice terms (including haircuts, maximum maturity, covenants, cure periods,  cross-default provisions, or othe r documentation features) offered to hedge funds for securities 
financing and OTC derivative transactions had re mained basically unchanged over the past three 
months.  About one-fourth of dealers noted that there had been an increase in the intensity of 
efforts by hedge funds to negotiate more-favor able price and nonprice terms over the same 
period—the same fraction as in the June survey.  Nearly all dealers indicated that the use of 
leverage by hedge funds had remained basically unchanged over the past three months, a different 
pattern of responses from surveys earlier in the y ear when modest fractions of respondents had 
pointed to a reduction in financial leverage.  R espondents also noted that there had been little 
change, on net, in the availability of additional financial leverage under agreements currently in 
place with hedge funds, which gives those funds the ability to rapidly increase their use of leverage should they choose to do so.  About one-fourth of dealers indicated that the provision of

  differential terms to most-favored (as a function of  breadth, duration, and extent of relationship) 
hedge funds had increased over the past three months. 
Trading Real Estate Investment Trusts 
About one-fifth of dealers indicated in the September survey that they had eased nonprice 
terms offered to trading REITs over the past three months, while price terms had remained 
basically unchanged.  More-aggressive competition from other institutions was cited as the most 
important reason cited for doing so.  Four of th e nine broad-scope dealers reported an easing in 
nonprice terms.  Respondents indicated that use of  financial leverage by trading REITs was little 
changed, on balance, over the past three mont hs.  About one-fifth of respondents noted an 
increase in the intensity of efforts by trading REITs to negotiate more-favorable price and 
nonprice terms over the past three months, and two -fifths of dealers reported an increase in the 
provision of differential terms to most-favored clients.   
Mutual Funds, Exchange-Traded Funds, Pension Plans, and Endowments 
A few dealers indicated that they had eased nonprice terms offered to mutual funds, 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pension plans, a nd endowments over the past three months, while 
price terms were said to have remained basically unchanged.  About one-fifth of dealers noted an 
increase in the intensity of efforts by clients in th is category to negotiate more-favorable price and 
nonprice terms over the same period.  Respondents to the September survey reported that use of 
financial leverage by mutual funds, ETFs, pension plans, and endowments was basically 
unchanged over the past three months.   
Insurance Companies 
While a  few survey respondents indicated that they had eased price and nonprice terms to 
insurance companies over the past three months, the vast majority of dealers noted that credit 
terms had remained basically unchanged.  Nearly  one-third of firms reported an increase in the 
intensity of efforts by insuran ce companies to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms.  
The use of financial leverage by insurance compan ies was also said to have remained basically 
unchanged.  
Separately Managed Accounts Estab lished with Investment Advisers 
Nearly all of the dealers reported that price and nonprice terms negotiated by investment 
advisers on behalf of separately managed accounts were basically unchanged over the past three 
months.  Efforts by investment advisers to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms on behalf of separately managed accounts and the use of  financial leverage by these clients were also 
reported to be little changed.  
Nonfinancial Corporations 
A few dealers reported that they had eased  price and nonprice terms offered to 
nonfinancial corporations over the past three months.  Only a very small net fraction of dealers

  indicated that there had been an  increase in the intensity of efforts by these clients to negotiate 
more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the past three months.     
Mark and Collateral Disputes 
As in the previous survey, most respondents indicated that the volume, persistence, and 
duration of mark and collateral disputes with each counterparty type included in the survey were 
little changed over the past three months. 
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES  
As in previous surveys, dealers indicated that nonprice terms incorporated in new or 
renegotiated OTC derivatives master agreements we re broadly unchanged, on net, over the past 
three months. 3  A few respondents, on net, reporte d that they had tightened somewhat 
requirements, timelines, and thresholds for postin g additional margin, and a few noted that they 
had eased somewhat with respect to other docum entation features including cure periods and 
cross-default provisions.  Nearly all of the d ealers indicated that initial margins (which fall 
outside the scope of master agreements) on contr acts referencing most underlying collateral types 
were little changed over the past three months.  About one-fifth of respondents noted that the 
posting of nonstandard collateral (that is, other than cash and U.S. Treasury securities) had 
increased somewhat over the past three months.  For most contract types included in the survey, 
almost all of the dealers indicated that the volume, duration, and persistence of mark and collateral disputes remained basically unchanged over the past three months.  However, a few 
dealers reported, on net, that the volume of mark and collateral disputes had increased for contracts referencing foreign exchange and commodities and decreased for contracts referencing 
equities and corporate credit instruments. 
SECURITIES FINANCING  
As in the previous survey, dealers reported that the credit terms under which most types 
of securities included in the survey are financed were little changed on balance.  The only notable 
exceptions were agency and non-agency RMBS, for which a few respondents, on net, indicated 
that they had increased the maximum amount of funding and extended the maximum maturity for 
their most-favored clients.   
Dealers noted that, on balance, demand for funding of RMBS had increased over the past 
three months.  About two-fifths of respondents reported an increase in demand for funding of 
non-agency RMBS, with many dealers noting that demand for term funding of such securities—funding with a maturity of 30 days or more—had  also increased.  Meanwhile, about one-fourth of 
dealers reported that demand for funding of ag ency RMBS had also increased, with the same 
share pointing to somewhat stronger demand for te rm funding.  In contrast, demand for funding 
                                                 
3 The survey asks specifically  about requirements for postin g additional margin, acceptable 
collateral, recognition of portfolio or diversifica tion benefits, triggers and covenants, and other 
documentation features, including cure periods and cross-default provisions.

  of corporate bonds, equities, CMBS, and asset-backed  securities was said to have been generally 
little changed on balance. 
Nearly two-fifths of respondents indicated that the liquidity and functioning of the 
underlying markets for non-agency RMBS a nd CMBS had improved somewhat during the 
previous three months.4  For other collateral types covered in  the survey, liquidity and functioning 
of the underlying markets were generally charact erized as little changed on net.  As in the 
previous survey, nearly all of the respondents indicated that the volume, duration, and persistence 
of market and collateral disputes were basically  unchanged for all of the collateral types.  
 
                                                 
4 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repurchase agreements and similar secured 
financing transactions, not changes in the funding market  itself.  This question is not asked with respect to 
equity markets in the core questions.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY  
We continue to view the risks around th e staff’s forecast for economic activity as 
elevated relative to the average experience of  the past 20 years (the benchmark used by 
the FOMC).  This assessment partly reflect s the U.S. financial crisis and the unusual 
depth and persistence of the recession, wh ich have uncertain implications for the 
magnitude of slack in labor and product market s, the pace at which the recovery is likely 
to proceed, and the resilience of the financial system.  We also see elevated risks related 
to the effects of the fiscal and financial situ ation in Europe.  The staff’s baseline forecast 
assumes that the European situation will eventually improve as their policymakers take 
additional steps to contain the crisis.  Of  course, euro-area policymakers could move 
more quickly and decisively to diffuse the cris is than we anticipate.  However, we see a 
greater risk that the European situation coul d deteriorate by more than assumed.  In the 
extreme, such a deterioration could result in  a severe economic downturn in Europe with 
substantial spillover effects to the domestic economy—effects that U.S. fiscal and monetary policymakers may have limited capacitie s to counteract.  The downside risks to 
the economic outlook are also exace rbated by the “fiscal cliff” looming at the turn of the 
year; fiscal policymakers, by choice or by gr idlock, could impose mo re restraint on the 
recovery than we have assumed in the baseli ne.  Overall, we view the risks to economic 
activity as skewed to the downside. 
Although we continue to see substan tial uncertainty around our outlook for 
inflation, we do not view the risks as unusually  high.  Long-run infla tion expectations and 
the trend in actual inflation have remained re latively stable in recen t years despite large 
fluctuations in oil and other commodity prices  and persistently wide  margins of slack in 
labor and product markets.  Moreover, we still view the risks to our inflation forecast as balanced.  On the upside, an increase in inflation expectations , possibly related to 
concerns about the size of the Federal Reserve’ s balance sheet and the ability to execute a 
timely exit from the current stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as could a 
larger amount of damage to the supply side of the economy than assumed in the baseline.  
A stronger recovery than expect ed might also lead to somewhat higher inflation.  On the 
downside, there is the possibility that weaker-than-anticipated economic conditions,

  further subdued increases in unit labor costs,  and low levels of resource utilization could 
cause inflation expectations, and thus act ual inflation, to decline over time.   
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline pr ojection using simulations of the staff’s models.  We start 
with two downside risks to aggregate dema nd—first, that an even sharper fiscal 
contraction than envisioned in the baseline c ould occur at the beginni ng of next year and, 
second, that the European crisis intensifies with severe spillovers to the U.S. economy.  
The next scenario considers the possibility of a faster improvement in the European 
situation; the fourth scenario addresses th e chance that the underlying pace of the U.S. 
recovery may be more robust than assumed in the baseline.  The last three scenarios focus 
on inflation risks—in particular , that oil prices surge; that  we have underestimated the 
amount of labor market damage that has occurred and thus the potenti al for higher future 
inflation; and that the headwinds slowing the recovery could prove to  be more protracted 
than we anticipate, causing inflation to  decline to a very low level.   
We generate the scenarios focused on domestic economic risks using the FRB/US 
model and the scenarios initiated by risk s centered on foreign events using the 
multicountry SIGMA model.  For the FRB/US simulations, we use the same estimated 
monetary policy rule that govern s the path of the federal funds rate in the baseline.  For 
the SIGMA simulations, we use a broadly similar policy rule that employs an alternative 
concept of resource utilization.1  In all of the scenarios, the size and composition of the 
SOMA portfolio are assumed to fo llow their baseline paths.   
Fiscal Cliff 
Our baseline projection assumes that the C ongress will avert the fiscal cliff in its 
most severe form, by extending the tax cuts initially enacted in 2001 and 2003, 
continuing to shield most taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax, and extending a 
number of other non-stimulus-related tax reduct ions.  In contrast, this scenario assumes 
that none of these actions are taken, there by increasing total tax payments by households 
and businesses next year by about 2½ percent of GDP relative to baseline.  Moreover, in 
                                                 
1 In the FRB/US simulations, the federal funds rate follows the estimated outcome-based rule 
described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B.  In the SIGMA simulations, the policy rule is broadly 
similar but uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate 
of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

  the alternative, the automa tic spending cuts required by the Budget Control Act’s 
sequestration provisions take full effect in  2013, further restraining federal purchases by 
about ¼ percent of GDP relative to baseline.2  In addition, these fiscal policy 
developments are assumed to weigh on consum er and business confidence by more than 
in the baseline.  As a result, real GDP e xpands only 1 percent in 2013 and 2½ percent in 
2014, on average 1 percentage point per ye ar slower than in the baseline.3  The 
unemployment rate rises above 8½ percent in 2014.  With a wider margin of resource 
slack, inflation declines slight ly to 1 percent in 2015, and th e federal funds rate does not 
begin to increase from its effective lower bound until mid-2015.   
European Crisis with  Severe Spillovers  
In this scenario, the current economic a nd financial stress in Europe intensifies 
sharply and causes Europe to plunge into a severe financial crisis and a deep recession.  
Reflecting the greater financial stress, bot h sovereign and private borrowing costs in 
Europe soar—with corporate bond spreads ri sing 400 basis points above baseline—and 
the confidence of European households and bus inesses plummets.  Real GDP in Europe 
declines about 8½ percent relative to base line by the end of 2013, despite a 25 percent 
depreciation in the real effec tive exchange value of the eur o.  Europe’s difficulties are 
assumed to have important financial and econom ic spillovers to the rest of the world, 
including the United States.  U.S. economic act ivity contracts sharply, as U.S. corporate 
bond spreads rise more than 300 basis points, eq uity prices plunge, cr edit availability is 
restricted, and household and business confiden ce erodes.  In addition, weaker foreign 
economic activity and the stronger exchange valu e of the dollar depress U.S. net exports.  
In all, U.S. real GDP declines at an annual ra te of more than 1 percent in the second half 
of this year and 3 percent ne xt year.  The unemployment rate rises to 10¾ percent in 2014 
before beginning to gradually decline.  With substantially greater resource slack and 
lower import prices, overall U.S. consumer pri ces decrease in 2013; pr ices begin to rise 
                                                 
2 After 2014, both tax revenues and government spending gradually return to their baseline 
trajectories, leading eventually to budget deficits that  are about the same as in the baseline.  However, 
because those deficits follow a period of greater fiscal  restraint, the ratio of go vernment debt to GDP is 
lower over the longer term in the alternative scenario. 
3 Although taxes increase by more than 2 percen t of GDP in 2013 in this scenario, the negative 
effect on real GDP next year is smaller as households in the FRB/US model adjust their spending gradually 
in response to the decline in their disposable income ; accordingly, real GDP in 2014 is also restrained.

  in 2014 as economic activity starts to recover.4  Under these conditions, the federal funds 
rate remains at its effective lower bound until mid-2016. 
Faster European Recovery 
This scenario assumes that the European authorities progress more rapidly than 
expected in addressing their fi scal and financial stresses a nd market participants react 
quickly and positively.  As a result, financial conditions improve more quickly than 
anticipated, causing European corporate bond spreads to fall roughly 100 basis points 
relative to baseline by mid-2013.  In a ddition, household and business sentiment 
improves markedly.  Reflecting these developm ents, real GDP in Europe expands about  
2 percent in 2013, rather than remaining nearly flat as in the baseline.  U.S. net exports 
are boosted by stronger economic activity in Europe  and in other U.S. trading partners, as 
well as by a depreciation in th e exchange value of the dollar as safe-haven flows unwind; 
more tightening of monetary policy in Europe than in the United States (relative to 
baseline) also pushes down the dollar.  All to ld, U.S. real GDP rises at a 3½ percent rate 
on average over the next two years, the unemployment rate falls to about 7 percent by the 
end of 2014, and core PCE inflation increa ses to 2 percent in  2013 and 2014.  Under 
these conditions, the federal funds rate begins  to rise one quarter earlier than in the 
baseline.  
Faster Domestic Recovery 
The recent stronger-than-expected gains in  employment and retail sales, along 
with continued increases in house prices, may point to a faster underlying pace of the 
recovery than we anticipate.  This scenario  takes on board this po ssibility by assuming 
that uncertainty about the durabil ity of the recovery lifts more  quickly than expected.  In 
addition, house values rise fa ster, reaching a level 10 percent above the baseline by late 
2014, with favorable implications for construc tion, household wealth, and the willingness 
of financial institutions to extend credit.  These various factors, in turn, fuel a more robust 
cycle of increased household and business conf idence, employment, credit availability, 
and spending that boosts the pace of the recovery.  Real GDP accelerates to an average 
                                                 
4 The rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects the forward-looking 
nature of inflation determination in SIGMA and the relatively modest degree of structural inflation 
persistence.  In particular, long-run inflation expecta tions remain firmly anchored at 2 percent, marginal 
costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, an d productivity is weaker (reflecting reduced capital 
spending).  In addition, import price inflation runs si gnificantly higher than in the baseline as the initial 
appreciation in the exchange value of the dollar is grad ually reversed.  Under alternative specifications of  
SIGMA that, for instance, allowed for more structural persistence in the inflation process or a less firm 
anchoring of inflation expectations, inflation would remain low for a longer period.

  growth rate of 3¾ percent in 2013 and 2014, and the unemployment rate declines to  
6¼ percent by the end of 2014.  Upward pressure  on inflation is initially tempered by the 
effects of increased capital investment on la bor productivity and unit labor costs.  Over 
time, however, greater resource utilization causes inflation to move up, to 2¼ percent in 
2016 and 2017.  In response to the higher inflation and stronger pace of real activity, the federal funds rate lifts off earlier and stays higher than in the baseline; accordingly, 
inflation will eventually settle back at the Committee’s longer-run objective. 
Higher Oil Prices  
The recent escalation of tensions with Ira n over its nuclear program highlights the 
significant upside risks to our outlook for oil prices.  In this scenario, we assume that 
greater geopolitical stresses and supply di sruptions temporarily increase oil prices  
$35 per barrel above baseline at the end of this year, but that prices then partially recede 
and level out at $20 per barre l above baseline.  U.S. domestic demand falls because 
higher oil prices reduce households’ real incomes and lower the return on firms’ 
investments, while real exports also decline due to weaker foreign economic activity.  
U.S. real GDP rises at an annual rate of about  1½ percent, on average, in the second half 
of this year and next year, and the unempl oyment rate is 8 percent at the end of 2014, 
nearly ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Reflecting the rise in energy costs, 
overall PCE inflation jumps to nearly 3½ percent in the second ha lf of this year.  
However, because the public recognizes that the direct impetus of higher oil prices to 
inflation is only temporary, and because they  anticipate that the Federal Reserve will 
maintain stable inflation over time, infla tion expectations remain well anchored and 
actual inflation subsequently moves back to  baseline.  In resp onse to the offsetting 
implications for policy of higher inflation and weaker real activity, the federal funds rate 
lifts off from its effective lower bound at the same time as in the baseline but rises more 
gradually thereafter. 
Damaged Labor Market 
The unusual depth and breadth of the downt urn may have impaired the efficiency 
of labor markets by more than we judge.  In th is scenario, we assume that the natural rate 
of unemployment reached 7 percent in early 2011 (1 percentage point above baseline) 
and that it will remain at that level for the i ndefinite future.  Furthermore, the trend labor 
force participation rate is assumed to d ecline more quickly, ending 2015 more than  
1 percentage point below the baseline.  Thes e conditions imply lower long-run levels of 
household income and corporate earnings; as  a result, underlying aggregate demand is

  weaker, and the unemployment rate barely inches down over the next few years.  
Nonetheless, a higher natural rate of unemp loyment implies that labor market slack 
remains persistently narrower than in the baseline, leading to highe r unit labor costs and 
greater upward pressure on consumer prices.  These price pressures are magnified by the 
assumption that policymakers initially fa il to recognize the weaker supply-side 
conditions, which leads them to maintain a more accommodative stance of monetary 
policy through late 2014 than they would ha ve chosen with a more accurate assessment 
of the supply side.  In respons e, the public’s long-run inflat ion expectations are assumed 
to move up (in contrast to the previous s cenario), and thus consumer price inflation 
eventually rises to 2½ percent.  Largely refl ecting these more infla tionary conditions, the 
federal funds rate begins to rise earlier than in the baseline.   
Protracted Headwinds  
Given the constraints on monetary polic y, persistently weak aggregate demand 
could eventually give rise to a self-reinforcing downward spiral in inflation.  In this 
scenario, concerns about the dur ability of the recovery fade  more slowly than in the 
baseline, leading firms to remain reluctant to  hire and invest, and households to remain 
cautious about their spending.  In addition, the resolution of ongoing problems in the housing market proves to be even more gradual than anticipated.  Reflecting these 
protracted headwinds, real GDP grows only 2 percent, on average, in 2013 and 2014, and 
gains in real GDP remain below baseline in to the second half of the decade.  The 
unemployment rate stays around its current elevated level for se veral years.  In turn, the 
sustained wide margins of slack in labor and product markets exert more-persistent 
downward pressure on inflation than in th e baseline, which eventually convinces 
households and firms that they are in a new in flation environment.  As a result, inflation 
expectations begin to fall, givi ng rise to a steady decline in co nsumer inflation to a rate of 
only ¾ percent starting in 2014.  With infla tion well below and the unemployment rate 
far above the FOMC’s longer-run objectives, the fe deral funds rate is still at its effective 
lower bound at the end of 2017.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained(2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
