Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received si nce the September Tealbook has mostly 
surprised us to the upside.  Consumer spending appears to be on a faster trajectory 
entering the fourth quarter, reflecting the surprising strength last month in retail sales and motor vehicle purchases as well as noteworthy improvements in consumer sentiment.  In 
addition, single-family housing starts and permits  both jumped in September.  And in the 
labor market, the unemployment rate is re ported to have declined a cumulative 
½ percentage point from July to September.  In contrast, some of the recent news from 
the business sector has been worrisome.  Orders of capital goods remained well below shipments in August, factory output and busin ess sentiment have remained soft, and the 
latest indicators of nonresidential constr uction suggest some greater-than-expected 
pullback in this sector as well.  All told, our forecast for the increase in real GDP over the second half of this year has been revise d up to an annual rate of 2 percent from 
1½ percent in the September Tealbook.  And, ev en after discounting some of the decline 
in the unemployment rate, we have lowered our current-quarter unemployment projection 
by ¼ percentage point to 8 percent.  
We have also taken on board the monetary policy actions announced by the 
Committee at the conclusion of its Septembe r meeting.  Accordingly, we now assume 
that Federal Reserve purchases  of longer-term securities will continue until the middle of 
2013, and that liftoff of the federal funds rate from its effective lower bound will not occur until the middle of 2015.  These new polic y assumptions contribute to an improved 
outlook for economic activity in the medi um term through the usual transmission 
channels:  a lower exchange value of the dol lar, higher stock prices , and lower interest 
rates.  
In particular, the rise in real GDP is  projected to step up next year, as 
improvements in the situati on in Europe, domestic financial conditions, consumer and 
business confidence, and farm production more than offset the anticipated drag from 
fiscal policy.  After next year , with the fiscal restraint exp ected to lessen and the factors 
supporting the recovery still in place, real GDP is expected to increase more rapidly.  We 
now project that real GDP will increase 2½ percent next year and 3½ percent in 2014; 
these figures are about ¼ pe rcentage point above our pr ojection in the September 
Tealbook.  We expect the unemployment rate to  decline from 8 percent in the current

  quarter to 7¼ percent by the end of 2014, near ly ½ percentage point below our projection 
in the September Tealbook.  We project that  the pace of economic activity will pick up 
further in 2015, with real GDP rising 3¾ pe rcent and the unemployment rate ending the 
year at 6¼ percent. 
The incoming data on core consumer price inflation have been close to our 
previous projection.  With long-term infla tion expectations well anchored, significant 
margins of slack in labor and product market s persisting for some time, and relatively 
small movements in commodity prices and im port prices, we continue to project core 
PCE inflation to be subdued through 2015.  All told, core inflation is expected to be 
1.6 percent next year and 1.7 pe rcent in 2014 and 2015.  Total PC E inflation runs slightly 
below core in the medium term, as retail energy prices edge dow n from their current 
levels in response to anticipated declines in crude oil prices.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
We conditioned the October Tealbook projection on monetary policy assumptions 
that are intended to be consistent with the September FOMC statement; as a result, we 
implemented important revisions to our a ssumptions for both the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet and the path of the federal funds rate.  With respect to  the balance sheet, we 
assume that the Federal Reserve will continue  the maturity extension program (MEP) and 
continue to purchase $40 billion per month of agency MBS until the end of this year.  We 
assume that the Federal Reserve will then  purchase about $85 b illion per month of 
longer-term securities until the middle of 2013, at which point we assume that the 
outlook for the labor market over the subsequent year will have improved by enough for the Committee to stop adding to the SOMA portf olio.  Results from the primary dealer 
survey suggest that market participants curren tly expect a larger e xpansion of the balance 
sheet than we have assumed.   
With respect to the federal funds rate , this round we adjusted the estimated 
outcome-based rule that we use to govern the path of the policy rate in order to bring it 
into line with the forward guidan ce in the September FOMC statement.
1  The adjusted 
                                                 
1 The federal funds rate follows the estimated ou tcome-based rule described in the appendix on 
policy rules in Book B, with an intercept adjustment  that reflects monetary policy as announced at the 
conclusion of the September FOMC meeting.  The adjust ment is calibrated to delay the first increase in the 
federal funds rate until the third quarter of 2015 under the economic outlook in the September Tealbook 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  outcome-based rule implies that liftoff of the target federal funds rate from its effective 
lower bound will occur in the third quarter of  2015, four quarters later than we assumed 
in the September Tealbook.  Of course, differe nt policy rules yield di fferent paths for the 
federal funds rate.  For example, an unadjus ted outcome-based rule would place liftoff in 
the fourth quarter of 2013, and, as discussed in  Book B, the Taylor ( 1999) rule calls for 
liftoff in the third quarter of 2014.  However, the rule that targets the level of nominal 
GDP projects liftoff in the fourth quarter of 2014, while the standard optimal-control 
exercise indicates that increases in the fede ral funds rate would not begin until the fourth 
quarter of 2015.  In contrast, the Taylor (1993 ) rule and the first-difference rule call for 
firming to begin much earlier than in the baseline projection or unde r optimal control.  
Indeed, the Taylor (1993) rule  calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the 
federal funds rate.     
The September Tealbook was not conditioned on the additional policy easing 
announced in the FOMC statement.  However,  at the time of the September Tealbook, 
market participants appeared to have priced  in considerable odds  of a significant policy 
move, so our previous projection had built in noticeable “disappointment  effects” in asset 
prices.  In this projection, we have implicitly removed these effects in light of the FOMC’s statement.  As a resu lt, the projected path for interest rates is lower than it 
would have been in the absence of Committee action, the exchange va lue of the dollar is 
weaker, and the projected path for U.S. equity prices is higher. 
Other Interest Rates 
The 10-year Treasury yield has increa sed about 15 basis points since the 
September Tealbook and was little changed, on net, following the September FOMC 
statement.  (See the box “Market Re action to the September 2012 FOMC 
Communications” in the Financia l Developments section.)  We now project that the yield 
on 10-year Treasury bonds will rise 1¾ percen tage points to 3½ percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2014.  This projected increase primar ily reflects the movement of the 10-year 
valuation window through the period of extrem ely low short-term interest rates and a 
gradual waning of the effects of unconventiona l monetary policy.  In addition, we assume 
that downward pressure on Treas ury rates will lessen next y ear as concerns abate about 
both the crisis in Europe and the fiscal situation at home. 
                                                                                                                                                 
that has been modified to incorporate the policy ch anges announced at the conc lusion of the September 
FOMC meeting.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2 015, this intercept adjustment is reduced and is zero 
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017.

  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  have fallen 25 basis points since the 
September Tealbook despite the increase in yields on comparable-maturity Treasury 
bonds, leaving their implied risk spread about 40 basis points narrower.  We expect this 
spread to hold fairly steady through the first ha lf of next year and th en to decrease about 
½ percentage point by the end of 2014.  C onventional 30-year mortgage rates have 
moved down since early September to about 3¼ percent, a shade be low the historical 
lows reached over the summer.  We project th at spreads of primary mortgage rates over 
MBS yields will narrow in coming quarters.  Nonetheless, with benchmark yields 
anticipated to normalize gradually over the next  two years, we expect mortgage rates to 
rise to about 4¾ per cent by the end of 2014. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
A broad index of U.S. stock prices has in creased about 3 percent, on net, since the 
September Tealbook, with much of that increase  occurring shortly after the release of the 
September FOMC statement.  We assume that equity prices will rise at an average rate of 
10 percent per year in 2013 and 2014, in part re flecting an easing of concerns next year 
about the European crisis and th e U.S. fiscal situation.     
Recent readings on home prices from Core Logic were a little stronger than we 
had expected, leading us to mark up the projected path for house prices a touch.  
However, we continue to project that home prices will be restrained by a rise in the 
supply of distressed properties for sale as some of the largest mortgage servicers step up the pace of foreclosure proceedings upon implem enting the terms of th eir settlement with 
the State Attorneys General.  In total, house prices are expected to increase about 
6½ percent this year but only 2¼ pe rcent, on average, in 2013 and 2014. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are unchange d in this forecast and continue to 
imply that federal fiscal policy will exert a substantial drag on ec onomic growth in the 
medium term, especially next year.2  The baseline projection envisions that the process 
                                                 
2 In particular, we still assume that the temporary payroll tax cut and the emergency 
unemployment compensation program will expire at the beginning of next year, as scheduled under current 
law.  We also continue to assume that federal discre tionary spending will be restrained by the caps in the 
Budget Control Act and by reductions in defense spending as overseas military operations are scaled back.  We also continue to assume that the additional cuts sc heduled to take effect in January 2013 under the act’s 
automatic sequestration provisions w ill be replaced by more-gradual budge t measures that achieve the same 
amount of cumulative deficit reduction through fiscal year 2021.  We have also maintained our assumption

  for reaching agreement on the extraordinary range  of fiscal issues up for discussion in the 
next several months will probably involve a num ber of short-term extensions at the end 
of this year and in early 2013.  This legi slative wrangling is assumed to weigh on 
household and business confidence, particul arly in early 2013.  Reflecting both the 
assumed tightening of fiscal policy and an anticipated acceleration in  tax revenues as the 
economic recovery strengthens, the federal budget deficit is proj ected to narrow from 
$1.1 trillion (7 percent of GDP) in fiscal year  2012 to about $600 b illion (3½ percent of 
GDP) in fiscal 2014.  We continue  to expect that fiscal polic y at all levels of government 
will directly restrain the rate of real GDP growth (excluding multiplier effects) by 
⅓ percentage point this year, 1 percentage  point in 2013, and ½ percentage point in 2014. 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Foreign real GDP is expected to incr ease at a subdued and downward-revised 
2 percent rate over the second ha lf of this year, restrained by the contractio n in the euro 
area and a slowing in other advanced fo reign economies and in emerging market 
economies.  The recent commitments by European  officials to support sovereign debt and 
move toward banking union have helped ease financial stresses.  However, conditions are assumed to deteriorate again until the authorities are compelled by circumstances to follow through on their promises; only by next year do we expect financial conditions to 
improve sufficiently to support a return to  positive economic growth.  The resulting 
pickup in the euro-area economy, in turn, will have positive spillovers to the rest of the world.  Along with the effects of faster U.S. growth, Europe’s recovery should help push 
total foreign economic growth up to 2¾ per cent in 2013 and about 3½ percent in 2014.  
This outlook is little changed from the September Tealbook. 
Since the time of the September Teal book, the nominal exchange value of the 
dollar has depreciated about 2 percent in response to both ea sing financial stresses in 
Europe and the September FOMC announcement.  However, we project the dollar will appreciate modestly through th e end of this year as fina ncial conditions in Europe 
deteriorate somewhat.  Thereafter, the dollar is  expected to depreciate in real terms at 
about a 3 percent annual rate through the end of the forecast period—clo se to the pace we 
had previously projected—reflecting the gradua l abatement of safe-haven pressure on the 
dollar and the trend declin e of the dollar against em erging market currencies. 
                                                                                                                                                 
that most federal tax provisions set to expire at the end of this year under current law, notably the 2001–03 
tax cuts, will not, in fact, be allowed to expire but instead will eventually be extended.

  Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
Oil prices are little changed in this projection.  The spot price of Brent crude oil 
closed at about $115 per barrel on October 16, unchanged from the September Tealbook.  
Prices had moved higher following th e September FOMC announcement, but 
subsequently fell back some as Saudi Arabia  repeatedly stated that it would work to 
moderate crude prices.  The price of West Te xas Intermediate (WTI) also increased after 
the FOMC announcement, but it has fallen $4 pe r barrel from its level at the time of the 
September Tealbook amid accumulating invent ories, closing on October 16 at $92 per 
barrel.  All told, our forecast for the price of imported oil ha s been revised down since the 
September Tealbook by about $1 per barrel ove r the forecast period.  In particular, the 
price of imported oil is projected to remain  at about $100 per barrel for much of 2013 and 
then slowly decline over the reminder of th e forecast period, reaching $92 per barrel at 
the end of 2014.  
A broad index of nonfuel commodity pr ices is about unchanged since the 
September Tealbook, as slightly higher prices of many industrial metals have been offset 
by declining agricultural prices.  Metals prices  rose in the week leading up to the FOMC 
meeting and immediately thereafter, but they have subsequently retraced much of these 
gains.  Although agricultural prices remain el evated, soybean and corn prices have fallen 
since the September Tealbook, as  the drought-stricken U.S. harvest has progressed a bit 
better than had been expected.  (For further details, see the box “T he Effects of the 2012 
Drought.”) 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
We project that real GDP will increase at  a 2 percent pace in the second half of 
this year, ½ percentage point faster than anticipated in the September Tealbook.  Labor 
market conditions seem a little better than  we thought at the time of the September 
Tealbook, and consumer spending and reside ntial construction look to be on higher 
trajectories.  In our thinking, these factors outweigh indicators of business investment and 
manufacturing production that ha ve come in below our expect ations.  We an ticipate that 
the drought will subtract about ¼ percentage poin t from growth in the second half of this 
year, with that effect unwinding early next year.3   
                                                 
3 In contrast to our assumption in the Septem ber Tealbook, the BEA now estimates that the 
drought affected farm production beginning in the second quarter by enough to reduce GDP growth that

 The Effects of the 2012 Drought  
This summer, for the first time in almost 20 years, drought struck a wide swath of the 
nation, including regions of the Midwest where the bulk of the nation’s corn and soybean crops are grown.  Earlier in the year, farmers h ad boosted plantings in response to tight 
inventories and favorable prices, and market participants had expect ed a sizable increase 
in crop production for the year (the red dotted line in the figure below).  The drought 
dashed these expectations and , as sh own by the black line, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture’s latest projection is roughly consistent with a 20  percent reduction in farm 
output in 2012 relative to the pre- drought forecast.  This loss of production, which 
occurred when inventories of corn and soybeans were already extremely tight, caused a steep rise in an index of crop prices —roughly 25  percent from June to mid -Octo ber (the 
lower- left figure on the next page).  As devastating as it has been for a segment of the 
population, the drought is expected to have only transitory effects on overall real GDP 
and consumer price inflation and no discernable effect on the unemployment rate.   
Within the farm sector, the drought’s effects have been dramatic but uneven.  Obviously, 
farmers directly affected by the drought have suffered setbacks only partly offset by insurance indemnities or government disaster assistance.  In contrast, the smaller group of farmers who have experienced little or no loss in their production are benefiting 
enormously fro m the steep rise in  crop prices, ending up better off than if the drought 
had not occurred.  On net, the drought may actually raise overall fa rm proprietors’ 
income slightly .      
We estimate that the transitory reduction in farm output caused by the drought will 
reduce real GDP in 2012 by about $15 billion.

1 In terms of the expenditure components of GDP, most of the reduction  in farm output will likely 
be reflected in a drawdown in farm inventories .  Of cou rse, the price increases caused by drought also 
may reduce purchases of crops for export, consumption, or intermediate use, but the transmission of 
the shock through these channels is much harder to discern and less certain .     The annual nature of the crop production

 process and the difficulties of allocating production across quarters presents a 
measurement challenge for the Bureau of Economic Analysis .  Our best  guess is that the 
adverse effect of the drought on GDP will  be registered mainly in the second half of this 
year, trimming  the change in real GDP over that period by roughly ¼  percentage point  at 
an annual rate.2
The drought- related spike in crop prices  has  more than reversed th e price declines since 
late 2011 that reflected  the market’s anticipation of a  rebound  in production following 
that year’s disappointing harvest.  We expect that this shock will be reversed early next year , as crop 
production is assumed to rebound to normal.  
3
   Looking forward,  futures prices tilt down sharply, 
suggesting that market participants anticipate that crop prices will retrace almost all of 
this season’s run- up by the end of next year.  The projected transitory nature of the surge  
in farm commodity prices, together with the relatively slow pass-through of grain costs into retail food prices, damp the projected swing in consumer food prices  in the Tealbook 
forecast.  In addition, we expect  that adjustments by livestock produc ers, who reportedly 
have been selling off breeding stock in response to poor pasture conditions and high grain costs, will hold down meat prices  in the near term, providing some offset to the 
effects of higher grain prices —although eventually the reduction in livestock herds will 
boost meat prices as well .  On balance, our models suggest that the drought- related 
surge in farm prices will begin  to show through to PCE food prices  shortly (the black line 
in the lower -right figure ), boosting  PCE food inflation to about 2½  percent in the fourth 
quarter and a little more than 3 percent over the first half of 2013.  These increases will  
add roughly ¼ percentage point to overall PCE inflation over that interva l.  Afterward, 
food price inflation is projected to slow , falling back to near  our June, pre -drought 
projection (the red dashed line) by the end of 2013. 
 
  
 
                                                 
2 The Bureau of Economic Analysis also put a little o f the drought effect into the second quarter. 
3 The surge in crop prices this year, which primarily reflects the shortfall in domestic supply, is 
considerably smaller than the increases in crop prices in either 2007  to 2008 or 2010 to 2011, periods 
when the upward pressure on crop prices came in large part from burgeoning world demand.

  The Labor Market 
The monthly readings for payroll employment and the unemployment rate—
which are taken from two different surveys —often send different signals, and the most 
recent releases underscore this point.4  Weighing the declines in the unemployment rate 
indicated in the household survey against th e modest gains in nonfarm payrolls, we now 
think that the labor market has been improving a little more in recent months than we 
thought at the time of the September Tealbook.  
  After changing little, on net, since th e beginning of the year, the unemployment 
rate is reported to have fallen from 8.3 percent in July to 7.8 percent in September, about 
½ percentage point below the level we projected in the September Tealbook.  While we 
have taken some signal from this decline, in our view the sharp drop in the published 
unemployment rate likely oversta tes the true improvement in labor market conditions.  In 
particular, the decline in the unemployment rate  seems considerably la rger than would be 
consistent with the modest growth in real GDP  we have seen thus fa r this year, and it has 
been accompanied by only middling growth of  payroll employment.  In addition, other 
indicators of labor market conditions, in cluding surveys of hiring plans and new 
unemployment insurance claims, are not decidedly improved.5  Accordingly, we have 
discounted some of the drop in the unemployme nt rate and now expect it to move back 
up to average 8 percent in the current quarter , 0.3 percentage point below our projection 
in the September Tealbook, and just a sh ade below its third-quarter average. 
We continue to project th at private nonfarm payrolls  will increase at an 
underlying rate of about 130,000 per month from October to December, a pace consistent 
with the flat trajectory for the unemploymen t rate and with real GDP expanding roughly 
in line with its potential.  We continue to th ink that distorted seas onal-adjustment factors 
will boost the published payroll employment  gains about 20,000 per month and thus 
leave them at about 150,000 per month, unchanged from the previous Tealbook.   
                                                                                                                                                 
quarter by ¼ percentage point.  As a result, our estimate of the effect of the drought on GDP growth in the 
second half of this year is slightly smaller than before.  
4 We received the August labor market report afte r the publication of the September Tealbook but 
before the September FOMC meeting, so the discussion in the text takes on board the previous two releases. 
5 We are discounting the signal from the steep decline in claims for the week ended October 6 
because it likely reflected a quirk in the way California reported their week ly numbers to the Department of 
Labor.

  The Industrial Sector 
Manufacturing output was weaker, on net, in August and September than we 
projected in the September Tealbook.  After posting only a sluggish gain in the second 
quarter, factory output in the th ird quarter as a whole declin ed at an annual rate of 
1 percent—substantially below our previous forecast of a 2 percent increase—as output 
in most major industry groups moved down. 
While the new orders diffusion indexes from the national ISM survey and the 
regional manufacturing surveys improved, on net, since the September Tealbook, they 
still point to only modest gains in manufacturing output in the next few months.  
Moreover, motor vehicle production schedules suggest a pace of light vehicle assemblies 
in the fourth quarter that is about ¼ million units below the September Tealbook forecast.  
All told, manufacturing output is projected to rise at an annua l rate of just 1½ percent in 
the fourth quarter, 1¼ percentage points  less than in the September projection.  
Household Spending 
The latest indicators of consumer spending look decidedly better than we 
anticipated in the previous T ealbook.  The portion of retail sales relevant for estimating 
PCE jumped in September after having been li ttle changed in August, and purchases of 
motor vehicles increased almost ½ million units , rather than remaining flat as we had 
been expecting.  Moreover, consumer sentim ent brightened substantially in September 
and early October.  On balance, our projecti on for spending in the second half has been 
revised up to 2¾ percent from 2¼ pe rcent in the September Tealbook. 
Incoming data suggest a somewhat faster housing recovery than we had 
previously assumed.  Single-family housing star ts and permits jumped in September after 
having been on a gradual uptrend through August.   In addition, sales of new and existing 
homes have picked up over the past year, wh ile the homeowner vacancy rate has declined 
and house prices have risen.  We project the pace of single-family starts to increase in the 
near term, from an average annual rate of about 520,000 units in the second quarter to 
580,000 units in the fourth quarter, about 30,000 higher than our projection in the 
September Tealbook. 
Some of the factors restraining home pur chases have fueled demand for rental 
units, leading to falling vacancy rates in th e multifamily sector and rising rents.

  Multifamily starts and permits rose smartly in September, and we expect them to 
continue to move up, as the s upportive fundamentals persist.  
Business Investment  
We now estimate that real business sp ending on equipment and software (E&S) 
edged down in the third quarter, compared w ith the small increase we had projected in 
the previous Tealbook.  Moreover, we expect spending in this category to remain weak in 
the fourth quarter, as concerns about the Eur opean situation, the U.S. fiscal situation, and 
the sluggish pace of the domestic recovery mo re generally leave businesses reluctant to 
invest.  Indeed, new orders for nondefense capital goods outside of transportation have 
fallen sharply over the past several months and currently stand well below the level of 
shipments.  In addition, indexes from various surveys of business conditions have been at 
low levels for several months, and surveys of capital spending plans have continued to be 
downbeat.  Thus, we expect E&S spending to in crease at an annual rate of just 2 percent 
in the fourth quarter, unchanged from  our September Tealbook projection. 
Incoming data suggest that investment in nonresidential structures (excluding 
drilling and mining) will declin e by somewhat more in the sec ond half of this year than 
we had previously projected.  Nominal cons truction spending in August was 3 percent 
below the second-quarter average, and high v acancy rates and low commercial real estate 
prices should continue to weigh on investment going forw ard.  Although there are hints 
of easing in financing conditi ons for existing commercial real  estate, financing conditions 
for new construction remain difficult.  Meanwhile, outlays for drilling and mining structures are anticipated to stay near their current levels in the near term.  
Inventory stocks appear to be fairly well aligned with sales in most sectors, 
although likely not quite as lean as they were earlier in th e year.  Estimates from the 
staff’s flow-of-goods system and reports on de aler inventories of motor vehicles do not 
point to significant inventory imbalances.  However, the Census Bureau’s book-value 
data suggest that the inventory-to-sales ra tio for the overall business sector has moved up, 
on net, in recent months, while the ISM diffu sion index on customer inventories suggests 
less comfort with inventories than was the ca se earlier in the year.  Given the monthly 
inventory data, which currently extend thr ough August, we expect that stockbuilding in 
the nonfarm business sector has contributed a bout ½ percentage point  to GDP growth in 
the third quarter and will be a neutra l factor in the cu rrent quarter.

  Government  
The contraction in the stat e and local sector appears to be ending, and fiscal 
conditions of these governments have started to improve.  After dropping at an annual 
rate of 1½ percent in the first half of the year, real state a nd local purchases are projected 
to be little changed in the second half, reflecting a smaller decline in real public 
construction expenditures and what now appears to be a modest increase in employment.   
We now project that real  federal purchases ticked up in the third quarter, 
reflecting stronger-than-expected defense spendi ng.  However, we took little signal from 
these data for current-quarter spending.  On net,  real purchases are expe cted to fall at an 
annual rate of about 1½ percent in the second ha lf of the year, a sma ller decline than in 
the previous Tealbook.  In total, federal, stat e, and local purchases are now expected to 
subtract only 0.1 percentage poi nt from the annual rate of re al GDP growth in the second 
half of this year, a slightly smalle r drag than in the September Tealbook.   
Foreign Trade 
After rising at an annual rate  of 5¼ percent in the second quarter of this year, real 
exports of goods and services are estimated to have declined 1¼ percent in the third 
quarter.  Unexpectedly weak export data in July and August led us to lower our third-
quarter estimate by 4½ percentage points relative to the September Tealbook.  In the 
fourth quarter, exports are expected to increase 3½ percent, a pace more in line with 
projected foreign growth and the recent path of the dollar.  Imports  in July and August 
were also weaker than expected, and we now  estimate that real imports of goods and 
services fell 1¼ percent in the third quarte r, compared with our expectations of a 
2¾ percent increase in the September Tealbook.  As with exports, we expect imports to 
recover in the fourth quarter  and increase at a 4 percent pace, supported in part by a 
rebound in oil imports.  All told, net exports ar e estimated to have been about neutral for 
GDP growth in the third quarter and then make  a small negative contribution in the fourth 
quarter; this contour is a bit more positive than in the previous Tealbook, owing to the 
lower path for the dollar.    
Prices and Wages  
Total PCE price inflation is expected to  run at an annual rate of just under 
2 percent in the second half of the year, l ittle changed from the September Tealbook.  
In the energy sector, an increase in crude o il prices over the summer, as well as a run-up 
in retail gasoline margins—reflecting refine ry outages and tight inventories—led to a

  sharp increase in gasoline prices in August and September.  With refinery operations 
returning to normal, we expect markups and thus retail prices to decline over coming 
months.  Spot and futures prices for natural gas have risen sharply in recent weeks, and, 
in response, we have revised up our forecas t for these prices over the coming winter 
heating season.  On balance, PCE energy prices are projected to increase at an annual rate of 11½ percent in the fourth quarter after ri sing 10½ percent in the third; our projection 
for the fourth quarter is 9 percentage poi nts higher than in the September Tealbook.  
Lower-than-expected consumer food pri ces in August and September led us to 
revise down our third-quarter estimate for PCE food price inflation to an annual rate of 
just over ½ percent.  We project that PCE f ood price inflation will pi ck up in the fourth 
quarter—to an annual rate of 2½ percent—as the sharp rise in farm commodity prices 
begins to show through into retail food pr ices.  Given the relatively small weight 
(7½ percent currently) of food prices in ove rall inflation, th e effect on total consumer 
price inflation is fairly minor.   
 Incoming data on core consumer pri ce inflation have been close to our 
expectations.  After having registered 1¾ pe rcent in the second qua rter, core PCE price 
inflation appears to have stepped down to a 1¼ percent pace in the third quarter, 
consistent with recent declines in core imports and a slowdown in some volatile services 
categories that had shown large increases earlier in the year.  We anticipate that the step 
down will prove transitory and, as a result, expect core PCE inflation to edge up to 
1½ percent in the fourth quarter. 
On net, the increases in average hourly earnings in August and September were a 
little slower than we had expected in th e previous Tealbook.  For the third quarter, 
average hourly earnings rose at  an annual rate of 1½ percen t, about ½ percentage point 
less than in the September Tealbook, and we e xpect them to pick up to a 2¼ percent pace 
in the current quarter.  We continue to e xpect that hourly compensation in the nonfarm 
business sector and the employment cost in dex for private industr y workers will both 
increase at an annual rate of about 2¼ percent in the second half of this year after rising 
around 2 percent over the prev ious four quarters.  
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK

support a somewhat stronger forecast for real GDP growth over the medium term through

  the three main transmission channels for mone tary policy:  The lower exchange value of 
the dollar will lead to some greater support to U.S. activity from foreign trade, higher 
equity prices will provide additional impetus to consumer spending by way of a 
conventional wealth effect, and the lower long-term interest rates will boost housing 
market activity and consumer purchases of dur able goods.  Thus, we now  expect that real 
GDP will increase 2½ percent in 2013 and 3½ percent in 2014; both figures are about ¼ percentage point faster than we proj ected in the September Tealbook.  In 2015, we 
project GDP growth to pick up a little further to 3¾ percent.  
As described earlier, we now expect the une mployment rate to be 8 percent in the 
current quarter.  With real GDP anticipated to increase just a little faster than its potential next year, we expect the unemployment rate to edge down to 7¾ percent at year-end.  
With GDP finally outpacing potential output by a more subs tantial margin in 2014 and 
2015, the unemployment rate drops more qui ckly, falling to 6¼ percent by the end of 
2015.   
Although somewhat stronger, the broad cont our of our medium-term projection is 
similar to that in the September Tealbook.  Nearly ½ percentage point of the pickup in 
real GDP growth from this year to next  reflects the anticipated rebound in farm 
production.  More broadly, however, further improvements in financial conditions, an 
eventual easing of the financial crisis in  Europe, and rising household and business 
confidence should contribute to an acceleration in real GDP over the next few years.  
Still, a number of other headwinds are expect ed to continue to restrain the pace of 
economic activity over the projection period, in cluding tight credit for some households 
and businesses, the ongoing drag from the wide spread losses in home equity, an overhang 
of vacant homes that continues to hold back residential construction, foreign demand that remains subdued, and continuing fiscal restraint.   
The largest portion of the fiscal drag that  we expect next year shows through in 
the form of restraint on the gr owth of the after-tax incomes of households and hence their 
spending.  The main elements of this restra int are the assumed expi ration at the end of 
this year of both the temporary payroll ta x cut and the EUC program as well as an 
increase in taxes that is assumed to be put in  place instead of the sequester.  By contrast, 
rising household wealth, increasing consumer  confidence, and a modestly improving 
labor market should provide support for cons umer spending.  In total, real PCE is 
expected to expand 2¾ percent in 2013, about  ¼ percentage point faster than we

  projected in September.  In 2014 consumer spe nding is expected to rise 3¾ percent, as 
the drag from fiscal policy wanes and as employment prospects, income growth, and 
household net worth continue to improve.   
Because of the lower path for the exchange  value of the dollar in this projection, 
net foreign trade now has a roughly neutral e ffect on GDP growth in the medium term 
rather than imposing a small drag as in the September Tealbook.  In particular, with 
foreign economic growth anticipated to im prove and with the dollar expected to 
depreciate over the medium term, real exports  are projected to incr ease 5 percent in 2013 
and 6¼ percent in 2014.  Meanwhile, real imports  are expected to grow at an average 
annual pace of 4½ percent over the medium te rm, supported by a pickup in the speed of 
the recovery in the United States that more than offsets the drag stemming from a 
depreciating dollar.  
Businesses apparently see littl e reason to expand capacity significantly at present.  
And, despite the fact that ma ny large firms have ample cas h on hand and ready access to 
capital markets, we expect the business sect or as a whole to remain cautious until the 
recovery is clearly on a stronger footing.  T hus, we project that E&S will remain quite 
weak in the first half of next year and then accelerate more markedly, as economic 
conditions improve and uncertainty abates.  Al l told, real E&S spending is projected to 
rise 4¼ percent in 2013 a nd 7½ percent in 2014.   
Lackluster final demand and uncertainty about the outlook is likely also holding 
back business investment in nonresidential stru ctures other than drilling and mining.  In 
addition, we anticipate that pe rsistently high vacancy rates and continued tight conditions 
for construction and development loans will continue to restrain investment in structures 
over the medium term.  As a result, we e xpect real nonresidential construction spending 
to be flat next year and to rise moderately in 2014.  In contrast, we expect investment in 
drilling and mining to increase in 2013, supporte d by rising prices for natural gas.  In 
2014, with natural gas prices flat and oil pr ices edging down, we expect investment to 
flatten out as well.  
We continue to anticipate only a modest  recovery in residential construction 
despite the encouraging signs in recent da ta and the lower mortgage rates in this 
projection.  Historically low mo rtgage rates would normally be expected to bolster home 
purchases and lead to a significant increase in new construction over the medium term.  
However, the ongoing difficulties faced by many households in accessing mortgage

  credit, coupled with lingering uncertainty a bout employment and income prospects, are 
likely to materially restrain the pace of recove ry in this sector.  Moreover, the flow of 
homes from foreclosure into the resale market is expected to remain substantial, limiting 
the impetus for new construction even as overall housing demand strengthens.  Thus, 
while we have upgraded our forecast for new home construction since the September Tealbook, the pace that we now project for si ngle-family housing starts in the fourth 
quarter of 2014—an annual rate of 820,000 units —is still well below its long-run trend. 
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the Natura l Rate of Unemployment 
We reduced our estimates of the leve ls of potential output and structural 
productivity at the end of 2011 nearly ½ pe rcent in this projection.  In part, the 
motivation for this revision derives from the BLS’s preliminary estimate that it will revise up the March 2012 level of privat e nonfarm payroll employment by 450,000.  We 
estimate that this benchmark revision will redu ce the level of labor pr oductivity early this 
year by nearly ½ percent and, by itself, would have moved actual productivity back in line with our estimate of its trend level.  However, in our view, firms—which remain uncertain about the outlook—are continuing to restrain employment, which suggests that 
productivity is still above  its trend level.  In other word s, we view the downward revision 
to actual productivity as consistent with a lower level of structural productivity than we had previously assumed.  In addition, this re vision brought our estimate of the output gap 
into alignment with the unemployment rate  gap in the first half of this year. 
We project that potential out put will increase 1¾ percen t this year and 2 percent 
in both 2013 and 2014, the same as in the pr evious Tealbook.  We also continue to 
assume that the natural rate of unemployment will remain at 6 percent through 2014.
6 
Productivity and th e Labor Market  
We estimate that the level of labor pr oductivity was about ½ percent above its 
(downwardly revised) structural  trend in the second quarter, c onsistent with our view that 
apprehension about the outlook is causing firm s to be reluctant to add to their work 
                                                 
6 We estimate that the boost to the “effective” natural rate of unemployment from the emergency 
and extended unemployment insurance programs has diminished and is worth less than ¼ percentage point 
at present.  This effect is expected to dissipate co mpletely next year as thes e programs are fully wound 
down.

  forces, just as seems to be the case with their physical capital.  However, we see this 
effect dissipating over time, boos ting the demand for labor.   
The projected path for payr oll employment reflects bot h this productivity dynamic 
and the anticipated accelerati on in real GDP.  In 2013, increases in private payroll 
employment are expected to average about  170,000 per month before picking up in 2014 
to an average monthly gain of 250,000; these figures are about 20,000 and 30,000 per 
month larger, respectively, than in the Se ptember Tealbook.  The employment gains we 
project for 2013 are st ill fairly modest, consistent w ith only a small decline in the 
unemployment rate next year.  In 2014, the faster pace of hiring brings down the 
unemployment rate more quickly to 7¼ pe rcent at the end of  that year.   
Resource Utilization 
Starting from its current level of abou t 4 percent, the ga p between actual and 
potential GDP is projected to narrow only slowly to 2 percent by the end of 2014.  
Similarly, labor market slack is expected to persist throughout the medium-term forecast, 
with the unemployment rate at the end of 2014 still 1¼ pe rcentage points above our 
estimate of the natural rate.  
There appears to be less slack in the manu facturing sector currently than in the 
broader economy, largely as a result of the steep drop in  capacity from 2007 to 2010.7  
Capacity utilization in the ma nufacturing sector stood at 77.1 percent in the third quarter, 
only about 1¾ percentage points below its long- run average rate.  Consequently, with the 
amount of slack in the manufacturing sector  and in the broader economy projected to 
narrow at roughly comparable rates over the rest of the forecast period, the factory 
operating rate reaches its long-run average in early 2014 despite the still-sizable GDP 
gap.  
Prices and Compensation 
Beyond the near term, overall inflation is  expected to remain low and steady, 
reflecting stable long-run infla tion expectations, the relative ly small movements projected 
for commodity prices and import prices, and pe rsistent slack in resource utilization.   
                                                 
7 Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly incorporates trends in labor input, 
our concept of capacity for the industrial sector focuses on the capability of plants to produce with the 
equipment that is in place and ready to operate; it does not take account of the po tential workforce, either 
inside the industrial sector or outside it.

  Recent indicators of inflation expectations have been mixed.  Expectations for 
PCE price inflation over the ne xt 10 years, as measured by the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters, were unchanged at 2.2 percent in the third quarter, whereas 10-year CPI 
inflation expectations edged down to 2.4 percent.  In the preliminary Michigan survey 
results for October, the median 5-to-10- year inflation expectation decreased to 
2.6 percent from 2.8 percent in September.  Meanwhile, the TIPS-based measure of 
inflation compensation 5 year s ahead—which may reflect ch anges in risk aversion or 
desire for liquidity as well as changes in inflation expectations—ha s increased since the 
time of the last Tealbook. 
Another important factor contributing to the low trajectory for inflation in this 
projection is import prices.  Pr ices of imported core goods are expected to decrease at a 
1 percent annual rate in the s econd half of this year, about unchanged from our projection 
in the September Tealbook, reflecting the la gged effects of previous declines in 
commodity prices.  With the dollar expected to depreciate over the medium term, we 
project that core import price inflation w ill turn positive and run at an annual pace of 
1½ percent, about unchanged fr om the previous Tealbook.  
These factors and the still-considerable  degree of slack in  labor and product 
markets expected for next year lead us to  project core inflation of 1.6 percent in 2013, 
unchanged from September.  But, with the somewhat larger decline in unemployment 
now anticipated in 2014, we proj ect that core infla tion will increase to 1.7  percent in that 
year, 0.1percentage point above  our projection in the Sept ember Tealbook.  Meanwhile, 
total PCE inflation is projected to run a littl e below core inflation over the medium term, 
as the anticipated declines in crude oil pr ices put downward pressure on retail energy 
prices.  In 2015, headline and co re inflation are expected to continue at about the same 
pace as in 2014.   
In our projection, persistent labor market slack, stable inflatio n expectations, and 
low rates of price inflation restrain the ri se in hourly compensation.  Both the nonfarm 
hourly compensation measure and the employment cost index are proj ected to rise about 
2¾ percent in 2013 and 3 percent in 2014.

  THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff’s forecast through 2020 using the FRB/US model and 
our assumptions about long-run supply-side co nditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  
The contour of the long-term outlook de pends on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent over the longer 
term, consistent with the Committee’s strategy statement after the January 
2012 meeting.  The federal funds rate is set according to the estimated 
outcome-based rule, adjusted to be consistent with the Committee’s September 2012 policy guidance.
8 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates from 2015 through 2017.  However, as the time of the normalization of the portfolio draws nearer, this downward 
pressure diminishes, which contributes to the rise in the 10-year Treasury 
yield.  By 2018, the process of portf olio normalization should have been 
essentially completed. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities a nd bonds continue to decrease gradually 
to normal levels, and financial instituti ons further ease their lending standards. 
 The federal budget deficit (measured on a NIPA basis) narrows a little further 
to an average of about 3 percent of GDP in 2015 and 2016 but widens thereafter, reflecting fast-rising transfer  payments for retirement and health-
care programs.  Federal debt stabiliz es temporarily at around 75 percent of 
GDP in the middle of the decade but th en rises to 78 percent of GDP by the 
end of the decade.  
 The real foreign exchange value of th e dollar depreciates 3 percent in 2015 
and 2 percent per year in 2016 and 2017; the pace of depreciation tapers off 
thereafter.  The price of crude oil de clines in 2015 and 2016 and then holds 
steady in real terms.  Foreign real GD P growth is 3½ percent in 2015 and then 
decreases gradually to a 3 percent annual rate late in the decade. 
                                                 
8 The adjustments made to the estimated outcome-based rule in light of the Committee’s forward 
guidance are discussed in more detail in the Key Background Factors part of this section.

   The natural rate of unemployment dec lines from 6 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2014 to 5¼ percent at the e nd of 2017 as conditions in the labor 
market continue to improve, and it rema ins at that level in the longer run.  
Potential GDP increases at an average annual rate of about 2¼ percent.   
The economy is projected to enter 2015 with output still below its potential level, 
unemployment above its assumed natural rate, and inflation below the long-run objective 
of the Committee.  In the staff’s long-term forecast, further improvements in household 
and business confidence, diminishing uncerta inty, and supportive financial conditions 
enable real GDP to rise at  an average annual rate of 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016.  With 
real GDP expanding at a pace faster than the gr owth rate of potential output, labor market 
conditions improve further, and the une mployment rate ends  2017 at 5.1 percent—
slightly below its long-run natu ral rate of 5¼ percent and a bout ½ percentage point lower 
than in the September Tealbook.  With long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain 
well anchored and the margin of slack in labor and product markets diminishing, 
consumer price inflation edges up to 2 per cent in 2017.  Later in the decade, real GDP 
growth moderates to a rate close to potentia l, the unemployment rate flattens out at its 
long-run natural rate, inflation holds steady at close to 2 perc ent, and the nominal federal 
funds rate stabilizes  at around 4¼ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
The g lobal econom y continues to struggle to gain traction , restrained by the fiscal 
and financial crisis in Europe, lackluster expansion in the United States,  and the resulting 
adverse spillovers  to the rest of the world.  Real GDP in the foreign economies  is 
expect ed to expand at a sluggish pace of 2 percent in the current  quarter, similar to the 
estimated pace of the two previous quarter s and down from early this year .  The recent 
weakness has been most pron ounced in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), but 
reduced exports also have sapped the momentum of the  emerging market economies 
(EMEs) .  Growth in the second half of the year is expected to be a little lower than i n the 
September Tealbook , as the recen t softness  in EME exports and some  other indicators 
have led us to revise our expectation that EME growth would firm over that period.   
Not all of the recent news has been downbeat , however .  Data on euro -area 
production and consumption have shown some im provement, suggesting a slightly 
shallower recession than we had anticipated .  In addition, s ince the September Tealb ook, 
financial stress es have eased further in response to positive policy developments in the 
euro area.  These  actions include the announc ement by the European Central Bank (ECB) 
of the details of its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program to buy sovereign 
bonds and the European Commission’s release of initial blueprints for a single European 
bank supervisor.   The likelihood of worst -case outcomes  for the e uro area appears to have 
diminished in response to these actions, and we assume financial stress es will be 
somewhat less pronounced throughout the forecast period as a result .  Nevertheless, w e 
still anticipate that euro-area financial conditions will deteriorate somewhat  over t he next 
couple of months as Spain deliberates over  whether to request official support , doubts 
remain about the efficacy of the OMT program , and progress toward banking union runs 
into snags .  This intensification of financial stress es should force European leaders to 
follow through on their earlier policy commitments, leading to a sustained, albeit slow 
and halting, improvement in financial conditions, which should allow the euro area to 
move out of recession by the middle of next year . 
Recovery in Europe and more -solid growth in the United States  should support an 
acceleration of activity throughout the global economy.  W e thus expect foreign 
economic growth to  pick up to about 2¾ percent in 2013 and nearly  3½ p ercent in 2014 , 
little changed from the September Tealbook.  Nevertheless , substantial risks remain for

  both the euro area and other parts of the world.  In the Risks and Uncertainty section we 
explore two adverse  scenarios :  The first is a n intensificatio n of the  European crisis with 
severe spillovers to the rest of the world, and the second is a hard landing in China that 
has significant effects on its major Asian trading partners.  
Foreign inflation is estimated to have edged up to about 2¼ percent in the  third 
quarter, nearly ½ percentage point higher than in our previous forecast, l argely reflecting 
continued food price pressures in the EMEs .  Inflation in the EMEs rose to 3¼ percent in 
the third quarter from 3 percent in the second, while i nflation in the AFEs remained 
subdued at ¾ percent .  We expect foreign inflation to pick up to 2¾ percent in the current 
quarter as earlier increases in energy prices pass through to inflation in the AFEs, but to 
drop back next year as energy and other commodity prices  ease.     
With inflation contained, m onetary policy is generally expected to remain 
accommodative in the AFEs,  with the ECB lowering rates on e more time and the Bank of 
England  (BOE) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) further expanding their asset purchase 
progr ams.   Monetary authorities in several Asian EMEs, including China, India, and 
South Korea, also are expected to ease mo netary policy  further in response to slowing 
growth .  However, the central bank of Brazil’s most recent rate cut is expected to be the 
last in this cycle . 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
We estimate that real  GDP in the AFEs continue d to expand at a feeble  ¾ percent 
pace in the third quarter .  This estimate is unchanged from the September Tealbook, as 
recent activity data have been a bit stronge r than expected for the euro area but have 
surprised on the downside for Japan.  We expect AFE growth to remain at about th e same  
pace in the current quarter , with further  contraction in the euro area and lack luste r growth 
in most other advanced economies .  Thereafter, w e project AFE growth to recover only 
gradually, averag ing 1¼ percent next year  and 2 percent in 2014.  This forecast is slightly 
higher than in the September Tealbook in response to the improved U.S. outlook and the 
recent diminution in fina ncial stresses in Europe , much of which occurred between the 
time the September T ealbook forecast closed and the September FOMC meeting . 
AFE inflation  remained subdued at an estimated annual rate of ¾ percent in the 
third quarter , as earlier declines in oi l prices passed through to the retail level.  We expect 
inflation to step up to 1¾  percent in the current quarter in response to the uptick  in oil

  prices  over the summer  as well as a hike in tuition fees in the United Kingdom.  
Thereafter, we continue to p roject that AFE inflation will average about 1½  percent, held 
down by sizable resource slack . 
Euro Area  
Recent indicators of euro -area economic activity have been mixed.  T he 
composite PMI and economic sentiment fell further during the third quarter, and t he 
unemployment rate remained at  a series high of 11.4 percent in  August .  However , retail 
sales and industrial production through August were higher than their second- quarter 
averages .  Taken together, these data suggest that e uro-area GDP contract ed at a  
¾ percent rate in the third quarter , similar to the previous quarter’s decline.  We expect 
GDP to contract a further 1 percent in the current quarter, reflecting continued weakness 
in domestic demand .  Both the third - and fourth- quarter declines are now e xpected to be a 
little less severe than previously projected.   
Since the September Tealbook, European policymakers have made further 
progress toward providing a credible financial backstop for Italy and Spain, including  the 
inaugurat ion of the  European Sta bility Mechanism and the  announcement of more details 
for the OMT  program , the ECB ’s new  bond- buying framework.  (See the box “Recent 
Policy Developments in the Euro Area.”)  However, uncertainty remains over how forcefully the ECB will use  OMT s.  Furtherm ore, Spain  and Italy remain reluctant to 
request official assistance for fear that they will be required to implement additional 
reforms and submi t to intrusive  monitoring.  
Given these concerns , we expect financial conditions to get moderately worse 
over t he next couple of months before getting better next year  after Spain requests 
assistance, opening the door to OMT purchases of Spanish sovereign debt that ease 
concerns about Spain and, more generally, about the effectiveness of the financial 
backstop .  We  also expect European officials to approve another disbursement of   
EU–IMF financing for Greece that mitigates the near -term risks of it exiting the euro 
area.  Nevertheless , full resolution of the crisis will likely be protracted, and we continue 
to expec t a very slow recovery.  Real GDP is projected  to increase just ¼ percent in 2013 
and about 1 ¼ percent in 2014 , a bit more  than in the previous forecast .   
Euro-area headline inflation edged up to 2¼  percent in the third quarter, reflecting 
higher retail energy prices and a hike in the Spanish value -added tax.  Inflation should

 Recent Policy Developments  in the Euro Area 
Financial stresses in  Europe eased sharply further in early September  (see figures  on 
the next page), as euro‐area leaders  expanded  backstops  for vulnerable  economies  
and made progress on financial  integration.   Subsequently,  the improvement  in 
market conditions  stalled as the Spanish government  failed to request  financial 
support, progress  in the establishment  of banking union ran into snags, and  the 
deepening  euro‐area recession elevated  political and social tensions  in the periphery.  
 
The main  positive development  in the euro area was  the release of details on 
September  6—a day after the close of the September  Tealbook—of  the European  
Central Bank’s (ECB’s) new sovereign  bond market intervention framework,  the 
Outright Monetary  Transactions  (OMT) program.   In this framework,  the ECB may 
purchase a government’s  bonds in secondary  markets once the government  obtains a 
program of assistance from  European  support facilities  and adheres to the program’s  
policy commitments.1  The  ECB announced  that its OMT purchases  would be 
conducted  with greater  transparency  and possibly in greater amounts  than its 
previous program  for bond  market intervention,  the Securities  Markets Programme.   
Moreover,  the ECB indicated  that it would not seek preferential  treatment relative  to 
other creditors,  should the bonds acquired  under OMTs be restructured,  which may 
encourage  private creditors  to continue  participating  in the market once OMTs begin. 
 Over the intermeeting  period, euro‐area authorities  also made incremental  progress 
on earlier policy  commitments.   The European Commission  (EC) released  a proposal  
for establishing  a single bank  supervisory  mechanism,  the first step in its vision for 
banking union.  In addition,  on September  12, a ruling by the German Constitutional  
Court allowed  Germany  to ratify the European  Stability Mechanism  (ESM) treaty, 
which brought the euro area’s  permanent backstop  facility into force. 
 
However, since mid‐September, financial  conditions  have improved  little, on balance, 
amid doubts about European  authorities’  determination  to follow  through on their 
commitments.   Importantly, even as  the economic  conditions  worsen, Spain has 
delayed requesting  the official aid necessary  for the ECB  to begin OMTs.  Spain’s 
reluctance appears  to reflect,  in part, concerns  about the severity of policy 
conditionality  associated  with official  support,  uncertainty  over  the magnitude of  ECB 
intervention  using OMTs,  and mixed signals from other European  authorities  
(especially  Germany)  on their desire to see Spain apply for a program.   Despite the  
introduction  of the Spanish government’s  2013 budget, with austerity  measures  worth 
almost €40 billion and  a raft of structural  reform plans, the IMF  lowered its outlook for 
Spain and joined a growing  consensus  that the government  will miss its  fiscal targets 
for 2012 and 2013.  Reflecting  similar concerns,  Standard  & Poor’s downgraded  Spain’s 
sovereign  rating by two notches  to just above junk  status.   
 
                                                 
1 The ECB will only purchase  bonds with residual maturity  of one to three years.  The ECB also 
indicated  that countries  already on an EU–IMF program  will be eligible only once they regain “full 
access”  to sovereign  debt  markets,  but it is unclear  what would constitute  full access.

Another factor likely weighing  on markets of late has been the  slowing of progress 
toward banking union for the region.  The EC’s proposal  for a single bank  supervisory  
mechanism  has been met  by disagreement  over the  division of powers between the 
ECB, the European  Banking Authority, and  the national authorities,  as well as over 
which banks would fall under  ECB supervision.   As was agreed by euro‐area leaders in  
June, without a single supervisory mechanism,  the ESM will not be able to recapitalize  
banks directly.  Such direct  recapitalization  would reduce the fiscal burden on  
governments  of vulnerable  euro‐area countries  with extensive  banking‐sector 
problems.  European  leaders also  disagreed  over the  scope of any potential  ESM 
direct recapitalization  of banks, even if the single supervisory mechanism  is 
established.  The Dutch,  Finnish, and German finance ministers  jointly stated that 
national authorities  should remain responsible for “legacy  assets” from previous  bank 
interventions—such  as the Irish government’s  bank support in  2010 or forthcoming  
injections  into troubled  Spanish banks. 
 
Finally, public discontent  with austerity  measures  has elevated  political and social 
tensions against a backdrop  of deepening  recession across  the periphery.   In Spain, 
rising unemployment  has helped fuel public demonstrations  against fiscal austerity  
and increased  tensions between the  central and regional governments, notably  that 
of Catalonia,  Spain’s largest regional  economy.   The new  Greek government,  elected 
in June, experienced its  first general strike as the unemployment  rate rose  above 
25 percent and as negotiations  over the  next aid disbursement  bogged down amid 
demands  from Greece’s  official creditors for yet  more budget cuts.   Even in Portugal,  
where the EU–IMF  program  is generally  on track, widespread  public protests  against 
austerity measures  pressured the  government  into changing  the composition  of its 
fiscal plans, replacing  some tax hikes with spending  cuts.

  ease to about 1½ percent by early 2013 and stay near that rate through the remainder of 
the forecast period, as these factors dissipate and the output gap widens.  
The ECB left its b enchmark policy rate unchanged at 0.75 percent during the 
intermeeting period.  As before, w e expect the ECB to lower this  rate to 0.5  percent in the 
next few months and to continue providing significant liquidity support to banks.

indicators su ggest that the underlying pace of economic activity has remained subdued , 
reflecting fiscal austerity and the effects of the euro -area crisis .  The third- quarter 
composite PMI was consistent with stagnation, while confidence indicators stood at low 
levels.   We thus expect only a small gain in real GDP in the current quarter.   The gradual 
resolution of the euro-area crisis and supportive monetary conditions should lift GDP 
growth to 1¾ percent in 2013 and 2¼ percent in 2014.  This outlook is little changed 
from the September Tealbook. 
We expect a hike in tuition fees and higher gasoline prices to boost U.K. inflation 
to 3¾ percent at an annual rate in the current quarter .  Ample spare capacity and the 
downward slope in projected oil prices should help inflati on settle around 1¾ percent 
thereafter.  With inflation likely to undershoot the 2 percent target and a substantial 
negative output gap, we continue to expect the BO E to expand its quantitative easing 
program £50 billion to £425 billion (28 percent of GDP)  this fall and to maintain the 
Bank Rate at its current level of 0.5  percent beyond 2014.  
Japan  
Japanese economic indicators suggest that GDP contracted at about a 1 percent 
rate i n the third quarter , more than the ½ percent  decline  we had expected .  In a ddition, 
second- quarter growth was revised down to 0 .7 percent from an initial estimate of 
1.4 percent.  T he recent weakness partly reflects  softer  external demand  along with the 
unwinding of fiscal stimulus measures .  Both exports and i ndustrial production fell  in 
July and  August, and the September manufacturing PMI was consistent with a further 
decline in production.  However, we expect a small gain in GDP in the current quarter, as 
private consumption has held up, partly supported by improvements in the labor market .

  Boosted by the global recovery, GDP growth should pick up to 1¼  percent in 2013 
before falling back to  ¾ percent in 2014 in response to  a planned consumption tax hike.   
We estimate that consumer prices fell at an annual rate of 2 percent in  the third 
quarter, the fastest pace of deflation in nearly two years, largely owing to a drop in food 
prices.  Core prices, by contrast, were nearly flat.  As food prices bottom out , we project 
that inflation will move back up to  near zero through the end of 2013 before spiking  to 
1¾ percent in 2014 on the consumption tax hike.  Amid persistent deflation and 
weakening growth prospects, the BOJ expanded its asset purchase program by 
¥10 trillion in early October.  We continue to expect a further expansion o f the program.  
Canada  
Recent data are broadly in line with our September Tealbook forecast of an 
expansion of the Canadian economy at a pace slightly under 2 percent in the second half 
of 2012.  Monthly GDP rose 0.2 percent in July , and t he manufacturing PMI remained in 
expansionary territory  through September .  Moreover, the economy added a relatively 
strong 52,000 jobs in September , although the unemployment rate inched up to 
7.4 percent because of a substantial increase in labor force participation.  As global 
economic conditions improve, we expect Canadian GDP growth to pick up to  2½ percent  
by the end of  2013 and to average 2¾  percent in 2014.  This projection is a touch stronger 
than in the September Tealbook , reflecting better U.S. growth prospects.  
We estimate that Canadian consumer prices were about flat for a second 
consecutive quarter i n the third quarter  in large part due to declines in retail energy 
prices.  With retail energy prices expected to bottom out, w e expect inflation to pick up 
but to r emain below 2 percent for most of the forecast period.  With  inflation contained , 
we anticipate, as in the previous Tealbook, that the Bank of Canada will keep its target for the overnight rate at 1  percent until mid -2014. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
We now estimate that growth in the EMEs slowed to just under 3½ percent in the 
third quarter, ½ percentage point below our September Tealbook estimate .  The 
downward revision reflects surprisingly weak exports from  emerging Asia, as well as a 
larger -than-expected  decline in  U.S. manufacturing production in August , which

  tempered our estimate of  Mexican activity.  Brazil is an exception, with third -quarter 
indicators coming in somewhat stronger than anticipated .   
We also reduced  our projection for EME growth in th e current quarter 
½ percentage point to about 3 ½ percent , reflecting the weakness in external demand as 
well as a more subdued projection for  U.S. manufacturing .  We continue to expect  real 
GDP growth to  pick up to about 4½ percent in 2013 and to nearly 5 percent in 2014 , little 
changed from the previous  Tealbook .  This outlook is supported by the gradual recovery 
in Eu rope and by an acceleration of activity in the United States.   
Inflation , at an annual rate of about 3¼ percent in the third quarter, has b een 
running at a higher -than-expected rate in most EMEs , as food price pressures have 
remained more elevated than we had anticipated .  We expect EME inflation to remain 
near that rate through the end of the year before easing  a little  to about 3 percent for much 
of the forecast period.  With growth concerns still prominent, the central banks of Korea , 
Thailand, and Brazil lowered their policy rates , and we expect further monetary easing in 
some of the EMEs , notably China, India, and Korea. 
China  
Chinese dat a received since the September Tealbook have been somewhat weaker 
than we had anticipated , largely due to lower external demand .  Retail sales and 
investment growth held up through August , but e xports fell in the third quarter .  In 
addition, although t he PMI edged higher in September , it stayed under 50 after dipping 
below that benchmark in August.  Consequently, we now estimate that Chinese real GDP 
expanded at an annual rate of only 7 percent  in the third quarter , down almost 
½ percentage point from the S eptember projection and  about the same as its average pace 
over the first half of the year.  The recent  data also suggest somewhat  less momentum in 
the economy, prompting us to mark down growth over the next few quarters as well.  We 
now call for GDP growt h to gradually pick up to 8 percent by the fourth quarter of next 
year and then stay around that pace for the remainder of the forecast , supported by 
monetary and fiscal policy stimulus and a gradual improvement in global demand.  
Overcapacity in some sect ors, including the property market, and the potential for 
stresses in the banking sector continue to pose downside risks to our forecast .  (For more 
details, see the “Hard Landing  in China” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty 
section  and the box “ Prospects for China’s Economy.” )

  Chinese consumer price inflation  was 1¾ percent at an annual rate in the third 
quarter,  ½ percentage point higher than in the previous Tealbook.  Headline inflation is 
expected to  pick up to 2½ percent in the curren t quarter , as food price s appear to have 
stabilized after falling earlier in the year, a nd to  increase to 3 percent by 2014, as 
economic activity accelerates and wage growth remains strong.  As current inflation rates 
are within the Chinese authorities’ co mfort zone, and they remain concerned about near -
term economic growth,  additional monetary and fiscal stimulus is expected . 
Other Emerging Asia 
Recent  indicators for  the rest of emerging Asia also have been  softer than 
expected.  Weakness  in exports , especially to Europe and the United States , has been  
particularly  pronounced, with third -quarter exports generally below  their second -quarter 
levels.  PMIs have also fallen below the 50 benchmark in most countries in the region, and t he advance GDP release for Singapore indicated that economic activity contracted in 
the third quarter.  W e now estimate that growth in the region dipped to 2¾ percent  in the 
third quarter , and we expect it to remain around this rate in the fourth quarter, compared 
with 3½ percent in  both quarters in the previous projection.  However, with the global 
recovery gain ing momentum over the next two years, we project that real GDP growth 
will pick up to 4 percent next year and to 4¾  percent in 2014.   
We estimate that inflation bottomed out  at an annual rate of 2¾  percent in the 
third quarter, slightly higher than we had projected at the time of the September 
Tealbook.  R ecent higher -than-expected  readings on inflation , especially for food,  also 
have led us to mark up our projection for inflation in the current quarter to nearly 
4 percent .  However, w e continue to expect inflation to step  back down to just over 
3 percent for the remainder of the forecast period  as the food- price cycle plays out .   
Latin America 
In Mexico, recent indicators point to more subdued activity in the third quarter 
than we had estimated in  the September Tealbook , largely reflecting the recent weakness 
in U.S. manufacturing .  Exports , which have  been sluggish  since the first quarter, have 
shown little sign of revival, industrial production has declined, and the PMI has deteriorated slightly.  Domestic demand indicators  have been more mixed .  In response to 
this information, we revise d down our estimate of third -quarter growth to 2 ½ percent, 
about ¾ percentage point belo w our September forecast.  Projections for U.S. 
manufacturing in the current quarter were revised down as well, and w e reduced our

 Prospects  for China’s Economy 
Chinese GDP  growth has slowed significantly  from the pace observed  during the recovery from  the 
global financial crisis (see the solid black line in the lower‐left figure on the next page).  We have 
had a more subdued  forecast for Chinese activity  than other forecasters  (including  Consensus  
Economics  and the IMF) for some  time, and, in light of the weakness of  the most recent indicators,  
we lowered our outlook further for the  October Tealbook.   We now project Chinese  growth at 
only 7 percent in the second half of this year and  rising slowly to just over 8 percent by 2014.  
Below we discuss the factors driving our forecast and our assessment of  the risk of a more severe 
slowdown.   
Our near‐term forecast is importantly  influenced  by the incoming  data on industrial  production,  
retail sales,  and imports.  A  simple regression  model based  on these data tracks output growth 
reasonably  well (the dashed  line in the lower‐left figure on the next page).  It puts growth in the 
third quarter at 7½ percent,  somewhat  above our Tealbook  estimate of  7 percent.   Some 
observers,  pointing to a sharp drop  in the growth of electricity  production,  have asserted  that 
actual output may have slowed more than indicated  by the official GDP data.  However,  this 
assertion is  contradicted  by the fact that the official data continue  to be well‐predicted  by our 
indicator‐based model.  Moreover,  electricity  production  contracted  more severely than  output 
growth during the global financial crisis, and this pattern may  be repeating  itself, as manufacturing  
for export,  which is relatively  electricity ‐intensive,  has slowed more than other sectors.  Finally, the 
latest data  point to a pick  up in electricity  production.  
Further out, we expect Chinese growth to edge back up as the factors that had been depressing  
growth become more supportive.   First, starting in 2010, concerns  about overhe ating led the 
government  to lower ceilings  on loan‐ to‐value ratios, clamp  down on bank lending, and 
aggressively  tighten monetary  policy—it  raised banks’  required reserve ratios a cumulative 
6 percentage  points and benchmark  lending rates 1¼ percentage  points.  These policies  succeeded  
in reducing  credit growth and cooling the housing  market.  However, late last  year Chinese 
authorities  began to loosen monetary  policy, and last month authorities  announced  approvals  for 
a large number of new infrastructure projects.  Credit  growth has picked up, and we expect 
further stimulus over the  coming quarters.    
The drag from the external sector, another  key factor that has hampered  Chinese growth,  is also 
expected  to lessen  going forward.  As  a result of the recessi0n  in Europe and the anemic  
performance of  the U.S. economy, Chinese  exports have continued  to weaken over  the past year, 
which has led business ‐investment  spending  to decelerate as  well (the  lower‐right figure  on the 
next page).  With growth in both the United States and Europe expected  to pick up next year, 
external demand for Chinese  output should improve.    
In putting together  our outlook for China’s  economy, we  continued  to consider  seriously  a few 
important  vulnerabilities.  Chief  among them is the overcapacity  that has emerged  in certain 
sectors.  For example,  steel production  quadrupled  over the  past decade as China became the 
world’s largest exporter, but the  sector is now running at only about 80 percent of capacity,  as 
both domestic and  foreign demand have slackened.   Arguably,  the property  market poses  even

 greater risks.  Vacant floor space is at an all‐ time high, there have  been anecdotal  reports of 
“ghost cities” (uninhabited  new housing developments),  and both sales and prices have declined  
from previous  peaks.  Finally, either an extended  slump in the manufacturing  sector or a collapse 
of the housing market could pose risks to the banking sector, which  is burdened  by the aftermath 
of the 2008–09  lending boom.  Loans for infrastructure projects  are reportedly  being rolled over 
so as not to be declared  in default, and the advent of  wealth‐ management  products—designed  to 
circumvent the maximum  interest rate allowed  on deposits—is  reportedly  leading to riskier  
investments  by banks and weakening  the deposit base.   
These vulner abilities all pose the risk of a hard landing for the Chinese  economy, and  that risk 
would be demonstrably  greater in  the event that  another adverse shock hit the global  economy.   
However, assuming  no such shock  occurs, our judgment  is that economic  growth slowly edging up 
is still the most likely scenario.   First, there are  indications  that property  market conditions  have 
improved, including  an uptick  in prices, real estate investment,  and sales.  Second,  and more 
important,  over the  longer term, Chinese cities  are projected  to absorb  an estimated  20 million 
people a year from the countryside—keeping  up with this  urbanization  will require  the equivalent  
of constructing  more than two cities  the size of New York annually.   Not only should these needs  
place a floor  under the property  market, but they  also imply continued  strong growth in demand 
for steel and other manufactures.   Third, a property  bust, even if it occurred,  would likely not 
trigger a financial  crisis:  loan‐to‐value ratios  are typically low, commercial  banks appear healt hy 
(based on the official statistics,  at least),  and the government  has $3.3 trillion  in reserves  to 
support its  banks.  Finally,  in the event of a hard landing, the  government  also has substantial  
scope to loosen monetary  and fiscal policy.  Reserve  requirements  and interest rates remain well 
above earlier  lows, restrictions  on property  lending could be loosened,  and the consolidated  
government  budget deficit was a mere 1 percent of GDP in 2011.  
All that said, we do not expect a return  of Chinese growth to the  double‐digit rates of previous  
years.  As a result of declines in labor force growth, reduced investment  as the economy  
rebalances  toward consumption,  and the slowing  typically experienced  as economies  approach 
the technological  frontier, we  estimate  that potential  growth should edge down from 10 percent  
before the global financial crisis to less than  7 percent by 2020.

  projection for Mexican growth to about 3 percent in response.  We expect r eal GDP 
growth to average 3¾ percent over the remai nder of the forecast period, in line with the 
projected path of  U.S.  manufacturing output.   
In contrast with  other regions, recent  data for  Brazil and Colombia have been a bit 
stronger than we had expected, leading us to revise up our estimate for third -quarter 
growth in South America  to 3 percent .  In Brazil, favorable  readings for the PMI and 
manufacturing production, along with strong retail sales growth, point to a somewhat  
more robust recovery of economic activity after several quarters of lackluster growth .  
We now expect that Brazilian growth will be 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter, about 
¼ percentage point higher than our September Tealbook projection.  With the economy 
showing slightly more momentum, we marked up Brazilian growth in 2013 a touch a s 
well.  We expect growth to rise gradually throughout the forecast, reaching 4 percent by 
2014.   
In Mexico, inflation surged  to an annual rate of 6½ percent in the third quarter, 
about 1¼ percentage point s above our September Tealbook forecast.  While we  were 
expecting the drought in North America and an outbreak of avian flu to push food prices 
up, the overall effect was larger than we h ad anticipated.  However, we expect food price 
pressures to subside by the end of the year, bringing inflation down to about 3¼ percent 
over the remainder of the forecast.  In flation in Brazil  also rose sharply, to 7¼  percent in 
the third quarter , but is expected to drop back and average about 5½ percent over the 
remainder of the forecast period.

Financial Developments 
Overall financial conditions became slight ly more supportive of economic growth 
over the intermeeting period.  The improvement  largely reflected th e effects of FOMC 
communications on the day of the Septembe r meeting, which mark et participants 
interpreted as indicating that policy would be more accommodative than previously 
anticipated.  Consistent with that reading, market participants now place smaller odds on 
the first increase in the federal funds rate o ccuring before 2015, and surveys show that the 
expected size of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) at the end of 2013 has grown 
significantly.  In addition, incoming data we re moderately stronger, on balance, than 
market participants had expected, reinforci ng the somewhat-more-optimistic sentiment in 
financial markets.  On net over the inte rmeeting period, yields on mortgage-backed 
securities (MBS) dropped substantially, with  some of the decreas e passing through to 
primary mortgage rates.  In addition, yiel ds on intermediate- and longer-term Treasury 
securities were little changed, while yields on corporate bonds fell.  Broad equity indexes 
were up a little on net.  Inflation compensa tion ended the period mode stly higher, and the 
dollar depreciated some.     
Recent trends in household and business debt in the United States generally 
continued over the intermeeting period, w ith some indicators suggesting a modest 
acceleration in the overall demand for credit.  Residential mortgage refinancing activity 
has picked up further in recent weeks, but it remains below the level that would normally be expected given current mortgage rates.  Consumer credit continued to expand, with 
solid growth in student and auto loans.  Corporate bond issuance was robust over the 
intermeeting period, but net issu ance of commercial paper (CP)  slowed.  Total loans held 
by commercial banks rose modestly in the th ird quarter, consistent with the October 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), in which 
domestic banks continued to report having eas ed their lending sta ndards and experienced 
increased demand across most loan categorie s on net (see appendix).  M2 grew at a 
relatively strong pace in September,  led by gains in liquid deposits.

  accommodation.  (See the box “Market R eaction to the September 2012 FOMC 
Communications.”)  Nominal Treasury yields had moderate fluctuations, rising in the 
wake of the meeting but ending the intermee ting period about unchanged, on net, even as 
the tone of economic data releases improve d in recent weeks.  The September FOMC 
minutes were largely in line with expectations, and their re lease elicited little market 
reaction.   
Real yields on Treasury infl ation-protected securities (TIPS) decreased somewhat, 
leaving inflation compensation over the next  five years and five  years ahead up about 
10 basis points over the intermeeting period.  An ecdotal reports suggest ed that investors’ 
perceptions of a more accommodative stance of monetary policy and slightly  
better-than-anticipated economic data releas es contributed to the uptick.  However, 
swaps- and caps-based measures of inflation compensation registered smaller increases 
over the period, and survey measures of infla tion expectations were flat or down a little, 
suggesting that inflation expect ations remain well anchored.  
On net over the intermeeting period, the expe cted path of the federal funds rate 
derived from OIS rates shifted down beyond mid-2014 and now moves above the current 
target range in the fourth quarter of 2014, about one quarter later than before the 
September FOMC meeting.  The modal policy path—the most likely values for future 
federal funds rates based on caps-implied risk -neutral distributions—remains within the 
current target range through the first quarter of 2016, about the same as before the previous meeting.
1  Market-based measures of policy uncertainty over the next few years 
declined over the period, likely in part because of the enhanced forward guidance in the 
FOMC statement. 
Results from the Open Market Desk’s late st survey of primary dealers showed a 
rightward shift in expectations for the timing of the first increa se in the federal funds rate 
target, as none of the dealers expect an  increase prior to th e first quarter of 2015, 
compared with about one-fifth in the previous  survey.  Dealers still view the third quarter 
of 2015 as the most likely time of the first increas e in the target rate.  They indicate that 
by that time, the unemployment rate is expect ed to be 6.8 percent and the inflation rate 
2.0 percent, but with a skew toward somewhat higher levels of inflation at the time of the 
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 15 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.

 Market Reaction  to the September  2012 FOMC Communications  
Investors  saw the September 2012  FOMC decision as providing  more accommodation  than 
they had expected,  and financial conditions  eased as a result.  In  particular,  as shown in  the 
table on the next page, between 12:15 p.m. and  4:00 p.m. on the day of the FOMC 
statement’s  release, yields  on agency mortgage ‐backed securities  (MBS) declined  up to 
50 basis points, the S&P 500 index  increased  1.6 percent,  and the broad nominal index of the 
dollar fell ½  percent.   TIPS yields declined  up to 10 basis  points; yields on nominal Treasury  
securities  were about unchanged,  on net, implying  an increase in  inflation compensation.1  
These changes occurred  despite the fact that market participants  had placed high odds on 
the FOMC taking some action at the meeting. 
Market commentary  following  the meeting and the Chairman’s  press briefing highlighted  
both the announcement  of additional  open‐ ended purchases  of agency MBS and the 
language  in the statement  indicating  that asset purchases  will continue  until the outlook  for 
the labor market substantially  improves.   According  to special Open  Market Desk  surveys of 
primary dealers conducted  before and after the meeting,  the median expectation  of the 
most likely levels of Treasury  and agency MBS holdings  at the end  of 2013 increased  about 
$100 billion  and $275 billion, respectively.2  These revisions  to expectations  brought the 
median expected  increase in  total SOMA holdings  through 2013 to $925 billion.3 
Market participants  had largely priced in the extension  of the forward guidance to mid ‐2015.  
However, postmeeting  commentary  suggested  that some market participants  viewed the 
sentence stating  that the Committee expects  “a highly accommodative stance of  monetary  
policy will remain  appropriate for a considerable  time after the economic  recovery 
strengthens”  as a signal of more accommodative  policy than they had expected.   Overall, 
the expected  path of the target federal funds  rate was  little changed  on the day, although  
the reaction of interest rate options (not shown) suggested  a modest  reduction  in 
uncertainty  about the target rate two  or more years ahead. 
The initial  increase in inflation compensation,  which was largest at shorter  maturities,  was 
reportedly  driven in part by an interpretation  of the FOMC statement  as placing relatively  
greater emphasis  on the employment  side of the dual mandate and  indicating  a greater  
willingness  to temporarily  tolerate above ‐target inflation  than had previously  been 
perceived.  A portion of  the increase may  have also reflected  improvements  in the economic  
                                                 
1 Immediately  following  the statement’s  release, Treasury yields  rose  sharply, reportedly  primarily 
because of disappointment  that  incremental  purchases  of Treasury securities  were not announced.   These 
moves  retraced over  the day, as investors  apparently  reassessed  the likelihood  of additional  Treasury 
purchases  after year‐end. 
2 The first special survey was conducted  on September  7, after the weaker‐ than‐expected  nonfarm 
payrolls report; the second special survey was conducted  the week after the FOMC meeting.   The post‐
payrolls survey asked only about  expected  holdings at the end of 2012  and 2013.  However,  the postmeeting  
survey showed that median expected  holdings peak in 2013, so expectations  at that horizon likely provide a 
reasonable  indication  of the changes in expected  purchase  amounts.  
3 Results from the Desk’s latest survey, conducted  the week of October 15, show that median expected  
purchases  through 2013 have since increased  about $100 billion.

  first rate increase.  Dealers expect the mont hly pace of Federal Reserve purchases for the 
next three meetings—extending through the first quarter of next year—to be $45 billion 
of Treasury securities and $40 b illion of agency MBS, and they  view the first quarter of 
2014 as the most likely time for the end of th ese purchases.  Compared with the regular 
September dealer survey, dealers have revi sed up the expected am ount of Treasury and 
MBS holdings in the SOMA through th e end of 2013 by about $410 billion and 
$330 billion, respectively.  At the upcoming meeting, dealers expect no material changes 
to either the economic assessm ent or the policy stance.   
Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $85 billion in agency MBS, 
reflecting both the new open-ended MBS purch ases announced at the September meeting 
and the ongoing program of reinvestment of  agency debt and agency MBS principal 
payments.  MBS yields declined significantl y over the intermeeti ng period, as did the 
option-adjusted spread relative to Treasury s ecurities.  Some measures pointed to strains 
in the agency MBS market for a short ti me after the FOMC announcement, with  
bid–asked spreads widening temporarily and implied financing rates for dollar rolls 
falling to more-negative levels.2  However, trading conditions normalized over 
subsequent days as the market’s expectati ons for purchases and originations firmed.  
Settlements of the Federal Reserve’s MBS purchases will ramp up over coming months, 
and market participants reportedly anticipate that the Desk would initiate additional 
dollar rolls in order to facilitate the settle ment of purchases should any pressures emerge 
in the market.  Separately, the Desk’s outrigh t purchases and sales of Treasury securities 
under the maturity extension program continue d as planned and did not appear to have 
any material adverse effect on Treasury market functioning.  (See the box “Balance Sheet 
Developments over the Intermeeting Period.”) 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
The staff’s broad nominal index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar 
depreciated ½ percent immediately after th e September FOMC announcement.  Since 
then, the dollar is little changed, on balance, as it subsequently appreciated against most 
advanced-economy currencies but fell further against the emerging Asian currencies.  In 
                                                 
2 The Desk may use dollar rolls to facilitate settlements associated with its unsettled agency MBS 
purchases.  Dollar roll sales affect  the timing or composition of the settlement of the Federal Reserve’s 
agency MBS purchases, effectively postponing the se ttlement for up to three months after the initial 
settlement date.

 Balance Sheet Developments  over the Intermeeting  Period 
Over the intermeeting  period, total assets of the Federal Reserve were little changed  on 
net (see the table  on the next page).  
Since the September FOMC  meeting,  the Open Market Desk  conducted  23 operations  as 
part of the maturity  extension  program:   The Desk purchased  $56 billion in Treasury  
securities  with remaining  maturities  of 6 to 30 years  and sold or allowed to mature  
without reinv estment $40  billion in Treasury  securities  with remaining  maturities  of 
3 years or less.1  Since the maturity  extension  program  was announced  in September  2011, 
the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury holdings  has risen from 6.1 years 
to 9.8 years.  In addition,  the Desk purchased  $85 billion  in agency MBS as part of both 
the new open‐ended MBS purchases  announced  at the September  FOMC meeting and 
the ongoing reinvestment  program of agency debt and agency MBS principal  payments.   
The majority  of the purchases  was in MBS with a 3 percent  coupon.  Given conventions  in 
the MBS market, settlement of  the transaction  lags the trade by as much as a couple of  
months, and the settleme nt of the purchases  to date will be spread across October,  
November, and  December.  The Desk  also purchased  a small amount  in newly issued 
2.5 percent  coupon 30‐year MBS and 2.0 percent coupon 15‐year MBS.   Of the MBS  
purchases  since the September  FOMC meeting,  $10 billion have settled.  The Desk sold  
$4 billion in MBS dollar rolls  over the  intermeeting  period, reflecting  the strains that 
temporarily  emerged  following  the announcement  of the new MBS purchases.2 
Other assets changed  only slightly.  Foreign central  bank liquidity swaps declined  
$7 billion to $13 billion, reflecting  almost entirely a decrease  in draws by the ECB.  The net 
portfolio holdings  of Maiden Lane III LLC decreased  $2 billion following  the September  
distribution  of cash proceeds  generated  from sales of the remaining  securities,  which 
were completed  on Augus t 23, 2012.  The remaining  cash balance represents  reserves  
held to meet  trailing expenses  and other obligations.   The net portfolio holdings  of 
Maiden Lane  LLC and Maiden Lane  II LLC were unchanged,  as were the loans outstanding  
under the Term Asset‐Backed Securities  Loan Facility.    
Liabilities  on the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet increased  a bit.  Reserve  balances  of 
depository  institutions  decreased  slightly less than  the increase in  the U.S. Treasury’s  
General Account.     
                                                 
1 A sale of $8 billion conducted  on September  12, 2012, is reflected  in the table but not in the text,  as 
the settlement  occurred  on September  13, 2012.  A purchase  of $5 billion conducted  on October 15, 2012, 
is reflected  in the text but not in the table, as the settlement  will occur on October  16, 2012.  A purchase  
of $5 billion conducted  on October 16, 2012, is reflected  in the text but not in the table, as the settlement 
will occur on October  17, 2012. 
2 The Desk may use dollar  rolls to facilitate settlements  associated  with its unsettled  agency MBS 
purchases.  Dollar  roll sales  affect the timing or composition  of the settlement  of the Federal  Reserve’s  
agency MBS purchases,  effectively  postponing  the settlement  up to three months after the initial 
settlement  date.

  particular, Chinese authorities have allowed the renminbi to appreciate 1 percent against 
the dollar.  The recent appr eciation of the dollar against the advanced-economy 
currencies reflected not only a modest resurgen ce in safe-haven flows amid some further 
concerns about the European situation, but also policy easing abroad.  Both the Bank of 
Japan (BOJ) and the Reserve Bank of Australia  (RBA) surprised market participants:  
The RBA cut its policy rate 25 basis points,  and the BOJ announced a ¥10 trillion (about 
$128 billion) expansion of its asset purchase program.  The BOJ cited foreign exchange 
market developments as a key risk to the economy and expressed concerns over a 
prospective global slowdown.  The central ba nks of both Brazil and Korea also eased 
policy.  
After declining significantly since late July, including between the date when the 
September Tealbook was completed and the subsequent FOMC meeting, the 
improvement in Spanish and Italian sovereign spreads stalled, in large part reflecting 
uncertainties about whether the Spanish govern ment will request a package of financial 
assistance, which in turn would open the door for Spanish sovereign debt to be purchased 
by the European Central Bank under its newly announced Outright Monetary 
Transactions program.  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the Spanish government’s bond 
rating to the lowest investment-grade rati ng, and the Bank of Spain warned that the 
country’s recession was deepening, which could th reaten next year’s fiscal targets.  The 
Spanish budget deficit this y ear is projected to reach 7.4 percent of GDP, well above its 
6.3 percent target, partly because of th e government’s prior bank recapitalization 
commitments.  Additional capital needs for Sp anish banks, according to an independent 
stress test, were estimated to be somewhat le ss than €60 billion, in line with expectations.   
Headline equity indexes for foreign ec onomies rose after the September FOMC 
statement but subsequently retraced those ga ins in some markets, ending the intermeeting 
period slightly lower in the euro area and Japan but higher in most emerging markets.  
Along with U.S. Treasury yields, 10-year s overeign yields in Ge rmany and the United 
Kingdom rose early in the period and then subsequently declined.   
 Foreign demand for U.S securities was r obust during July and August, especially 
for Treasury securities, according to the la test TIC data.  Priv ate foreign investors 
increased their purchases of Treasury securities relative to the first half of the year, and 
their appetite for U.S. corporate securiti es rebounded somewhat, with a resumption of 
small net purchases of U.S. equity and co rporate bonds.  Foreign official investors

  acquired Treasury securities at a strong pace in July and August.  Data on custody 
holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of Ne w York indicate that  after a temporary 
slowdown in September, official inflows pi cked up in the first half of October.  
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
Indicators of the condition of domestic financial institutions improved over the 
intermeeting period.  Indexes of equity pri ces for those institutions ended the period 
modestly higher.  Both spreads on longer-t erm senior unsecured debt and CDS spreads 
for large financial institutions have declin ed in recent months, reportedly because of a 
reduced perception of tail risk from the Europ ean sovereign debt crisis.  The third-quarter 
earnings of large bank holding companies that have reported to date have been roughly in 
line with expectations, on balance, with strong investment banking and trading income 
offset by generally weaker net interest margins.   
Conditions in unsecured short-term dolla r funding markets appeared to improve 
some over the intermeeting period.  LIBOR–OI S spreads continued to edge down, as did 
the spread between the rates implied by the three-month forward rate agreement and the 
OIS rate three to six months ahead—a forward-looking measure of potential funding pressures.  The forward measure exhi bited some volatility in advance of The Wheatley 
Review of LIBOR:  Final Report,  commissioned by the United Kingdom’s Chancellor of 
the Exchequer; the report investigates and recommends potential improvements for determining LIBOR.
3  The average maturity of unsecured financial CP issued by 
institutions with European parents increas ed over the intermeeting period to about the 
same as that of such CP issued by institu tions with U.S. parents.  The amount of 
outstanding European unsecured financial CP was little changed on net.  Dollar 
borrowing from the ECB funded by the Federal Reserve’s swap line fell further from 
$19.5 billion to $12 billion.   
In secured funding markets, repo rates in creased further, on balance, over the 
intermeeting period across collateral types elig ible for open market operations.  Market 
participants continue to attribute the firmne ss in Treasury general co llateral repo rates to 
                                                 
3 Market participants reportedly viewed the recommendations in the final report as largely 
incremental changes to both the constituency of the LIBOR panel and the methodology for determining 
rates that were unlikely to affect LIBOR fixings in the near to medium term.  It is currently unclear when, 
or if, any of these recommendations will be implemented.

  elevated collateral supply and possibly to c onstraints on dealer bala nce sheets.  Futures 
quotes indicate that market participants e xpect repo rates to decline over early 2013, an 
expectation perhaps related in part to the expiration of unlimited insurance on 
transactions accounts, which could cause some investors to move cash from bank 
deposits into the repo market.  In asset- backed commercial paper (ABCP) markets, 
amounts outstanding have remained stable for programs with sponsors domiciled in 
Europe and have edged down for those with sponsors domiciled in the United States.  
Overnight spreads on ABCP are little changed, on net, and spreads on most European 
ABCP remain close to those on U.S. issues. 
OTHER DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad equity price indexes are a little hi gher, on balance, ov er the intermeeting 
period, as gains following the Septem ber FOMC meeting and generally  
better-than-expected economic data releas es have been muted by concerns about 
corporate profitability.  The equity premiu m—as measured by the spread between the 
expected real equity return for the S&P 500 index and the real 10-year Treasury yield—
remains very elevated by historical standa rds and was little changed over the period.  The 
VIX, an index of option-implied one-month- ahead volatility for the S&P 500 index, fell 
notably following the September FOMC announ cement but ended the period only a little 
lower. 
With the reporting season for third-quarter earnings just having started, a forecast 
of aggregate operating earnings per share for firms in the S&P 500 index constructed 
from private-sector analysts’ expectati ons suggests only slight growth from  
second-quarter levels.  Moreover, forecasts of  meager growth in profits are broad based 
across sectors.  Looking forward, an index of  revisions to analysts’ forecasts of  
year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms was little changed in th e four-week periods 
ending in mid-September and mid-October. 
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  reached a record low level during the 
intermeeting period, and their spreads to yi elds on comparable-maturity Treasury 
securities narrowed, on net, but remained some what elevated compared  with their recent 
lows in the first half of 2011.  Yields a nd spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds 
also decreased.  Spreads of rates on A2/P 2-rated unsecured CP issued by nonfinancial 
firms over those on AA-rated nonfinancial issues  were about flat, on net, over the period.  
Secondary-market prices for leveraged loans edged up slightly.

  BUSINESS FINANCE  
On balance, the credit quality of nonfin ancial corporations remained solid, 
although a few indicators have weakened a little  in recent months.  In the second quarter, 
the aggregate liquid asset ratio for such firms was still near its highest level in more than 
20 years, while the aggregate ratio of debt to assets has been trending up but remained 
well below its average for the same historical period.  Moreover, the six-month trailing 
bond default rate for nonfinancial firms stayed  low in September, as did the expected 
year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial fi rms from the Moody’s KMV model.  However, 
the volume of nonfinancial corporate bonds that were downgraded by Moody’s, although modest overall, exceeded the volume of such bonds that were upgraded in the third 
quarter, an event last seen in the third quarter of 2009.  The ratings downgrades were 
concentrated among speculative-grade issues.   
The pace of investment- and speculati ve-grade bond issuance by nonfinancial 
firms picked up significantly in September from the already robust pace seen in previous months.  Many issuers reported that they intended to use the proceeds to pay down other 
debt.  Indeed, the volume of nonfinancial CP  outstanding contracted  as some issuers 
reportedly refinanced into longer-maturity bond s.  Growth in C&I loans at commercial 
banks was slower in September than its  robust pace earlier in the year.   
Leveraged-loan issuance through the first three quarters of 2012 lagged the pace 
seen over the same period in 2011 but nonetheless remained solid.  Interest on the part of 
institutional investors has stay ed particularly strong.  For ex ample, issuance of loans to 
collateralized loan obligati ons (CLOs) has continued apace, and the volume of CLO 
issuance during the first half of this year exceeded the level reached for all of 2011.  
Market participants have noted that a robust appetite for syndicated loans by institutional 
investors has resulted in a progressive easing of price and nonprice terms (including 
covenants and deal leverage), reminiscent of the dynamics last seen in the first half of 
2011 before the European fiscal crisis intensified. 
Robust share repurchases and cash-financed merger activity left net equity 
issuance deeply negative in the second quarter.  The pace of gross public equity issuance 
by nonfinancial firms picked up some in September from the lackluster levels observed in prior months, but overall issuance in the th ird quarter remained subdued compared with 
the first half of 2012.  Cash merger comp letions and announcements continued to be 
strong in the third quarter, but announcemen ts of new repurchase programs slowed.

  Financial conditions in the commercial r eal estate (CRE) sector remained weak 
amid elevated vacancy and delinquency rates.   Commercial mortga ge debt outstanding 
contracted at an annual rate of 5 percent in  the second quarter.  However, some indicators 
have pointed to modest improvement in this  sector.  Prices for CRE properties from 
repeat-sales indexes have continued to tre nd up from their troughs.  In addition, spreads 
of yields on commercial mortgage-backed s ecurities (CMBS) over sw ap rates narrowed, 
on net, over the intermeeting period in both th e primary and secondary markets.  Issuance 
of CMBS was solid in the third quarter and is  expected to remain so through the end of 
the year.  A relatively large fraction of comm ercial banks reported in the October SLOOS 
that they had experienced stronger demand fo r CRE loans, on net, over the past three 
months. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Mortgage rates declined to historically  low levels during the intermeeting period, 
with the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages falling to below 
3.3 percent for a time.  The decl ine in mortgage rates reflect ed the even larger drop in 
MBS yields that followed the September FOMC statement.  The staff anticipates that the 
spread between mortgage rates and MBS yiel ds will narrow over time, though the pace of 
the adjustment is expected to be gradual, in part because of continued capacity constraints 
at mortgage originators.  Refinancing ac tivity increased further in September and 
October, though it remained subdued relative to  the prediction of staff models based on 
past behavior, as tight underw riting conditions, consolidation in the mortgage origination 
sector, and low levels of home equity continue to limit access to credit for many 
households. 
House prices have continued to rise, a nd some indicators of credit quality on 
residential real estate loans have also improved.  The CoreLogic aggregate house price 
index rose for the eighth consecutive mont h in August and has now increased nearly 
6 percent from the low it reached at the e nd of last year.  The fraction of existing 
mortgages that are seriously delinquent re mained elevated, but the rate at which 
mortgages are entering delinquency continued to  trend down in July, likely reflecting the 
effects of the tight underwriting conditions that  have prevailed for the past few years.  
Many borrowers who have been shut out  of the conventional market by tight 
underwriting standards have obtained FHA-insured mortgages instead, but a special 
question on the October SLOOS indicates that many lenders have also  pulled back over

  the past few years from offering FHA loans to  borrowers with FICO scores at the lower 
end of the range allowed by FHA underwrit ing standards, such as 580 or 620.   
Consumer credit expanded briskly in A ugust.  Nonrevolving credit continued to 
increase at a robust pace because of growth in student and auto loans.  Revolving credit 
increased in August but has been relatively little changed over the past few months on 
balance.  Delinquency rates for consumer cr edit remained low, apparently reflecting a 
compositional shift toward higher-quality borrowers  that is mainly due to still-tight credit 
conditions.  Consumer ABS issuance was strong in  the third quarter a nd close to the pace 
seen earlier this year. 
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Since the September FOMC meeting, th e Treasury Department has auctioned 
$178 billion in nominal securities and $13 billion in 10-year TIPS.  The auctions were 
generally well received, with bid-to-cover ratio s mostly above their historical averages 
and indirect bidding ratios within recent ra nges.  Demand at the 10-year TIPS reopening 
was slightly weaker than expected, with the yield slightly higher than expected and the 
bid-to-cover ratio moderately below its recent average. 
The pace of gross issuance of long- term municipal bonds was robust in 
September, primarily due to refunding issuan ce amid low yields.  However, net issuance 
of long-term bonds in September was near zero, reflecting resistance among state and 
local governments to take on more debt in an environment of un certainty about their 
fiscal positions.  
Consistent with the stressed budgets of many state and local governments, ratings 
downgrades of municipal bonds by Moody’s con tinued to substantially outpace upgrades 
in the second quarter, and higher-frequency da ta on ratings changes suggest that this 
trend continued in the third quarter.  However, default rates on municipal bonds have not 
risen from their long-standing low levels.  CD S spreads for states moved slightly lower 
over the intermeeting period, as did the ratio of yields on long-ter m general obligation 
municipal bonds to yields on compar able-maturity Treasury securities.

  business side, C&I loans maintained a double-di git increase in the third quarter.  CRE 
loans continued contracting but at a somewh at slower pace.  On the household side, 
modest growth in closed-end residential mort gage loans was partially offset by continued 
declines in home equity loans.  Consumer credit card loans were little changed while 
other consumer loans increased slightly, in  line with movements over the past year.  
Noncore loans—including reverse repos and loans to nonbank financial institutions—
rose briskly in the quarter.  Finally, banks’ hol dings of securities advanced markedly over 
the quarter, which was mainly attributed to increases in Treasury securities. 
According to the October SLOOS, m odest fractions (weighted by loans 
outstanding) of domestic banks continued to report having eased thei r lending standards, 
on balance, across major business and househol d loan categories.  In addition, for the 
second straight quarter, reports of stronger demand were relatively widespread for many 
types of loans.  Regarding C&I loans, however, the fraction reporting stronger demand 
was subdued compared with reports during most of 2011 and early 2012.  Standards on 
C&I loans were little changed in the third quarter, suggesting that th ey remained about in 
the middle of their range since 2005, as indicat ed in the previous survey.  However, 
relatively large fractions eased a number of terms on such loans.   
 M2 grew at an annual rate of about 10  percent in September, somewhat faster 
than in August.  Strong growth in liquid de posits and currency was partially offset by 
ongoing declines in small time deposits and ba lances in retail m oney market funds.  
Liquid deposits, the largest component of  M2, continued to expand briskly, likely 
reflecting low yields on investment alte rnatives and ongoing concerns over global 
growth.  Robust foreign demand for U.S. ba nk notes contributed to brisk growth in 
currency.  A large decline in reserve balances, which was mainly driven by an increase in the somewhat volatile level of the Treasury’s Ge neral Account, more than offset currency 
growth over the period, resulting in a sizable drop in the monetary base in September.

Appendix 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
In the October Senior Loan Officer Opini on Survey on Bank Lending Practices, domestic 
banks, on balance, reported little change over the p ast three months in their standards for business 
lending and residential real estate lending, and a moderate easing of standards for consumer 
loans, on net.1  Significant fractions of banks reported a strengthening of demand for some 
categories of business lending, prime residential mo rtgages, and auto loans, on balance, while 
demand for most other types of loans was about unchanged.  The October survey included special 
questions on factors affecting C&I loan growth over the past year and lending to European banks.  In another set of special questions, the survey queried banks about their participation in the 
revised Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP 2.0) and about changes in their standards for approving applications for mortgages insure d by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) 
relative to pre-crisis levels. 
On net, domestic and foreign respondents re ported that C&I lending standards at their 
banks were about unchanged over the past three months, but most terms on such loans had eased 
in response to heightened competition from other lenders.  Based on a weighting of institutions’ responses by C&I loans outstanding at the end of the second quarter of 2012, a modest fraction reported that demand from large and middle-market firms had increased over the past three months on net.
2  Demand from small firms was reportedly about unchanged.  On net, foreign 
respondents reported little change  in demand for C&I loans over th e survey period.  A special 
question addressing the rapid C&I loan growth at commercial banks over the past year generally 
indicated that customers using bank loans to replace debt from nonbank sources was not an 
important reason for that growth.  The responses to a second set of special questions on business lending indicated that standards to European banks  and affiliates continued to tighten over the 
previous three months.  A small fraction of banks reported that commercial real estate (CRE) 
                                                 
1 The October 2012 survey addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to 
businesses and households over the past three months.  This appendix is based on responses from 
68 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  As part of the recent renewal of 
the survey, 6 domestic banks have been added to the previous sample of banks.  These additions did not materially change the net fraction of banks responding to a particular question.  Respondent banks received the survey on or after September 25, 2012, and responses were due by October 9, 2012.  
For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction of 
banks that reported having tightened standards minus the fraction of banks that reported having eased standards.  For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fractions of banks that reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand. 
2 Unless otherwise noted, statements about banks’ responses apply on a weighted and unweighted 
basis.  Where the results based on weighted and unweighted analyses of responses are materially different, the approach used to summarize responses is explicitly stated. 
Large and middle-market firms are generally defined as firms with annual sales of $50 million or 
more and small firms  as those with annual sales of less than $50 million.

and nontraditional mortgages had remained unchange d over the past three months on balance.  
After weighting responses by residential mortgage loans outstanding, a sizeable fraction of 
respondents reported in both the July and Oct ober surveys that demand for prime residential 
mortgage loans had increased but demand for nontraditional mortgage loans had decreased on net.
3  Responding to a special question on FHA lending, most domestic banks indicated that their 
lending standards for approving an application fo r an FHA-insured purchase mortgage were about 
the same as before the financial crisis for a borro wer with a credit score of 660, but that standards 
had tightened significantly for borrowers with lower FICO scores.  In addition, banks continued to indicate that a material portion of refinance applications at their bank was attributable to HARP 
2.0, and that they expected a significant portion of HARP 2.0 applications to be completed. 
Within consumer lending, modest fractions of respondents continued to report an easing 
of standards on credit card and auto loans; respondents indicated that their standards on other 
types of consumer loans were about unchanged.  On balance, terms on all types of consumer 
loans reportedly changed little over the past three months.  While a modest percentage of banks 
continued to report an increase in demand for credit card and auto loans, demand for other 
consumer loans remained about th e same over the survey period. 
LENDING TO BUSINESSES  
Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending 
Weighting responses by institutions’ C&I loans outstanding, domestic survey respondents 
indicated that their C&I lending standards to fi rms of all sizes were about unchanged over the 
past three months on balance.  On the same b asis, modest fractions of respondent banks had 
indicated an easing of standards on loans to large bo rrowers in each of the previous two surveys.  
While C&I lending standards were little change d, domestic banks re ported having eased most 
C&I loan terms to borrowers of all sizes.  For most terms, the easing was somewhat more 
widespread than it was reported to have been in the July survey.  Of the respondents that reported 
easing either standards or terms over the past three months, almost all cited more-aggressive 
competition from other banks or nonbank lenders  as an important reason for doing so.  The 
number of banks citing more-aggressive competition as an important or very important reason for 
the change in their bank’s lending position has been increasing since the October 2011 survey.  
As in the previous survey, no other reasons were broadly cited as important. 
On balance, the weighted responses from do mestic banks indicated that C&I loan 
demand had increased over the past three months.  As in the July survey, around 15 percent of 
respondents indicated that demand from large firms had strengthened, on net, while demand from 
                                                 
3 On an unweighted basis, positive net fractions of respondents to the October survey indicated 
that demand for both prime and nontraditional mortgage loans had increased.

  smaller firms remained little changed.  Res pondents that reported an increase in C&I loan 
demand broadly cited three reasons for the change :  an increase in their customers’ need to 
finance investment in plant and equipment, an  increase in customers’ merger and acquisition 
financing needs, and a shift to their bank from other sources of funding. 
On balance, branches and agencies of fore ign banks reported that their C&I lending 
standards had remained about the same over the past three months.  Considering only branches 
and agencies of European banks, C&I lending standa rds were also about unchanged.  In the past 
several surveys, the balance of respondents to the foreign survey had reported tightening their C&I standards.  As was true for domestic res pondents, the most widely cited reason for easing 
standards or terms among branches or agencies was more-aggressive competition from other lenders.  After reporting a notable weakening of C& I loan demand in the July survey, the balance 
of foreign respondents reported little change in de mand for such loans over the past three months. 
Special Questions on Factors Af fecting Recent C&I Loan Growth 
The October survey included a set of special  questions that asked banks about possible 
factors related to the brisk expansion in C&I lending at commercial banks over the past 
12 months.  Survey respondents were asked to quantify the share of the dollar volume of the 
increase in outstanding C&I loans at their banks that  was attributable to customers who used the 
lending to replace debt that was previously provided by nonbank sources of funding.  Respondents did not generally report that this f actor was a significant explanation for recent C&I 
loan growth at their banks.  Weighting the r esponses to this question by the dollar volume of 
institutions’ increases in outstanding C&I loans over the past year, about 10 percent of respondents reported that replacement of de bt from nonbank sources accounted for between 
25 and 45 percent of the increase at their banks.  Another 30 percent of the respondents reported 
that the replacement of nonbank debt accounted fo r less than 25 percent of the increase in C&I 
loans at their bank, and the remaining respondents re ported that replacement of such debt was not 
a factor in C&I loan growth at their banks.  T hus, on average, survey respondents estimated that 
the replacement of nonbank debt accounted for roughly 8 percent of the dollar volume of the increase in C&I lending at their institutions over the past year.
4  An additional question asked the 
banks that indicated that the replacement of nonbank debt had contributed to loan growth at their banks to identify the most important nonbank sources of such debt.  In response to this question, 
non-investment-grade or unrated bonds and syndicated  loans that are held by nonbanks were the 
most widely cited alternative funding sources. 
Special Questions on Lending to and Competition from European Banks 
The October survey also included questions  about European banking institutions and 
their affiliates that have been asked on several recent surveys.  Respondents to the domestic and 
foreign survey continued to report that their lending standards to European banks and their 
                                                 
4 Responses are assigned to the midpoints of the ranges provided in the question and then 
weighted by the dollar volume of the increase in C&I loans outstanding at respondent institutions on an 
end-of-period basis between the second quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2012.

  affiliates had tightened over the past three months, although the fractions of respondents 
indicating that they had tightened standards dec lined significantly between the July and October 
surveys on net.  As in the July survey, domes tic banks reported that they had experienced little 
change in demand for loans from European banks  and their affiliates and subsidiaries.   
The share of domestic banks that have observe d an expansion of business associated with 
C&I lending because of a decrease in competition from European banks has trended down 
noticeably in the past two surveys.  Weig hting domestic banks’ responses by outstanding C&I 
loans, just over one-third of domestic respondent s indicated that they ha d experienced a decrease 
in competition from European competitors that ha d resulted in some increase in business at their 
banks.  Almost all of the remaining domestic re spondents reported having experienced a decrease 
in competition from European banks, but the decr ease did not appreciably boost business at their 
banks.   
Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending 
On balance, a small fraction of domestic r espondents to the October survey reported that 
standards on CRE loans had eased over the previous three months.  The fraction of banks that 
reported a strengthening of demand for CRE loans increased notably, moving to about 35 percent 
when responses are weighted by CRE loans on respondent banks’ balance sheets.  Branches and 
agencies of foreign banks reported similar trends in CRE lending conditions ―the percentage of 
respondents that reported easing standards was just  under 10 percent, while a moderate fraction 
reported that demand for CRE loans had stre ngthened over the same period on balance. 
LENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS  
Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending 
Banks’ residential real estate lending sta ndards reportedly remained about unchanged 
over the past three months, while demand for prim e residential mortgages increased.  As in each 
of the previous three surveys this year, responde nts reported little change in their standards for 
prime mortgages.  In the October survey, standards on nontraditional mortgages were reportedly unchanged, in contrast to the tightening reporte d earlier in the year.  Weighting responses by 
respondent banks’ holdings of residential real est ate loans at the end of the second quarter of 
2012, the fraction of banks that reported an in crease in demand for prime residential mortgage 
loans remained close to its level in the July survey, which was at the very high end of its 
historical range over the past 10 years.  In cont rast, weighted responses continued to indicate that 
demand for nontraditional mortgages declined in the past two surveys.
5  Standards and demand 
for home equity lines of credit were reportedly unchanged.   
                                                 
5 Although the survey instructs respondents to exclude refinancing from their considerations about 
demand for residential mortgages, responses to the query about changes in demand may have been 
influenced by the volume of refinance applications that banks received over the past three months.

  Special Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending 
A pair of special questions asked banks to compare their bank’s standards for approving 
an application for an FHA-insured purchase mort gage for a borrower with a given FICO score 
with the standards that prevailed at their ba nk in 2006.  Weighting responses by respondents’ 
holdings of residential mortgage loans, about 80 percent of banks reported that their bank was 
about as likely to approve an application for an FHA mortgage from a borrower with a FICO 
score of 660 as they were in 2006.  For a borrower with a FICO score of 620, most banks reported 
that they would be somewhat less likely to approve  the loan under their current lending policies, 
and for a FICO score of 580, the majority of respondents indicated that they would be much less likely to approve such a loan using their curre nt standards.  A follow-up question asked banks 
that reported that they were currently less likel y to approve an application for an FHA-insured 
mortgage about the reasons for the change in their lending position.  Banks broadly cited three main explanatory factors:  higher servicing cost  if the mortgage were to become delinquent, 
higher risk of putback of delinquent mortgages by the FHA, and concerns that the bank’s 
“compare ratio” could hinder its ability to participate in FHA programs.
6 
The October survey also repeated a pair of special questions from the July survey about 
HARP 2.0.  In the October survey, about  40 percent of banks surveyed estimated that HARP 2.0 
accounted for more than 30 percent of refinance applications, a bit below the percentage found in the July survey.  Between the July and Octobe r surveys, there was a marked increase in the 
proportion of banks that estimated that the share of HARP applications that would be completed 
was between 80 and 100 percent.  In the current  survey, about one-fourth of banks reportedly 
anticipated that at least 80 percent of their bank ’s HARP 2.0 applications would be completed, as 
compared with about 10 percent of respondents th at estimated the same completion rate in the 
July survey.  Another one-fourth of responde nts indicated that somewhere between 60 and 
80 percent of applications would likely be completed, and almost all of the respondents categorized the percentage of HARP applications that would likely be completed as greater than 
40 percent.   
Questions on Consumer Lending 
As in the July survey, domestic banks repor ted that they had eased standards on auto 
loans over the past three months, while standard s on other consumer loans had remained about 
unchanged.  However, the weighted fraction of banks that reported an easing of standards on 
credit card loans, which are highly concentrated among a handful of banks, climbed to about 30 percent, on net, a much higher reading than in the previous survey.
7  On balance, banks 
reported that most terms on all types of consumer  loans were about unchanged over the past three 
months. 
                                                 
6 A bank’s compare ratio is the ratio of its FHA delinquency rate to the delinquency rate on FHA 
loans in the geographic area.  Lender s with high compare ratios may face a udits or other measures from the 
FHA. 
7 The unweighted net fraction of banks reporting an easing of credit card lending standards 
remained near 10 percent.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline pr ojection using simulations of th e staff’s models.  The first 
scenario examines the consequences of an  even sharper fiscal contraction at the 
beginning of next year than assumed in the ba seline.  The next two scenarios consider a 
couple of upside risks to aggregate dema nd—first, that business and consumer 
confidence improve much more quickly than in  the baseline and, sec ond, that the recent 
encouraging readings on labor market conditions signal that the economic recovery is 
proceeding more quickly than we have assumed.   The fourth scenario explores the risk 
that we have both underestimated the pers istence of the headwi nds restraining the 
recovery and overestimated the ability of monetary policy to offset that restraint.  The 
fifth scenario focuses on the upside risk to infl ation stemming from th e possibility that we 
have misjudged the amount of labor market da mage that has alrea dy occurred.  The last 
two scenarios consider foreign risks to th e domestic economy—first, that the European 
crisis could intensify with severe spillove rs to the U.S. economy and, second, that the 
pace of economic growth in China and other Asian countries could slow markedly.   
We generate the first five scenarios us ing the FRB/US model and the last two 
scenarios using the multicountry SIGMA mode l.  For the FRB/US simulations, we use 
the estimated outcome-based rule to govern devi ations of the federal funds rate from its 
baseline path, making adjustments to account  for the additional accommodation implied 
by the Committee’s current forward guidance;  for the SIGMA simulations, we use a 
broadly similar policy rule that employs an alternative concept of resource utilization.1   
                                                 
1 In the FRB/US simulations, the federal funds rate follows the estimated outcome-based rule 
described in the appendix on policy rules in Book B, with an intercept adjustment that reflects monetary 
policy as announced at the conclusion of the September FOMC meeting.  The adjustment is calibrated to 
delay the first increase in the federal funds rate until the third quarter of 2015 under the economic outlook 
in the September Tealbook modified to incorporate changes announced at  the conclusion of the September 
FOMC meeting.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2 015 this intercept adjustment is reduced and is zero 
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017.  However, to  the degree that real ac tivity in the scenarios is 
stronger or weaker relative to the September outlook, or  inflation is higher or lower, liftoff will occur 
earlier or later.  In the SIGMA simulations, the policy rule is broadly similar but uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would 
occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

 In these scenarios, we have assumed that the size and composition of  the SOMA portfolio 
follow their baseline paths.2   
Fiscal Cliff 
Our baseline projection assumes that the C ongress will avert the fiscal cliff in its 
most severe form by extending the tax cuts initially enacted in 2001 and 2003, continuing 
to shield most taxpayers from the altern ative minimum tax, and extending a number of 
other non-stimulus-related tax reductions.  In c ontrast, this scenario assumes that none of 
these actions are taken, thereby increasi ng total tax payments by households and 
businesses next year by about 2½ percent of GDP  relative to the base line.  Moreover, in 
the alternative, the automa tic spending cuts required by the Budget Control Act’s 
sequestration provisions take full effect in  2013, further restraining federal purchases by 
about ¼ percent of GDP relative to the baseline.3  In addition, these fiscal policy 
developments are assumed to weigh on consum er and business confidence more than in 
the baseline.  As a result, real GDP expa nds only 1¼ percent in 2013 and 2½ percent in 
2014, on average 1 percentage point per year less than in the baseline.4  The 
unemployment rate rises to 8¼ percent in  2013 and 2014.  With a wider margin of 
resource slack, inflation declines to 1 percen t in 2015, and the federal funds rate does not 
begin to increase from its effective lower bound until mid-2016.   
Greater Expectations 
Recent reductions in risk premiums on corporate bonds and other assets, along 
with increases in consumer sentiment, may point to a more rapid improvement in 
business and household expectations of future economic acitivity than is assumed in the 
baseline.  Moreover, the public may take comfort from the FOMC’s recent actions and 
                                                 
2 Given the guidance in the FOMC’s September statement that the portfolio would be responsive 
to labor market conditions, it would be desirable to incorporate endogenous rule-based adjustments to the 
portfolio in our scenario analysis.  The staff is cu rrently investigating possible specifications for such 
adjustments.   
3 It is possible to envision an even worse outco me, as even in this scenario we assume that 
Congress raises the debt ceiling and does not default on Treasury debt. 
  After 2014, both tax revenues and government spending gradually return to their baseline 
trajectories, leading eventually to budget deficits that  are about the same as in the baseline.  However, 
because those deficits follow a period of greater fiscal  restraint, the ratio of go vernment debt to GDP is 
lower over the longer term in the alternative scenario. 
4 Although taxes increase by more than 2 percen t of GDP in 2013 in this scenario, the negative 
effect on real GDP next year is smaller as households in the FRB/US model adjust their spending gradually in response to the decline in their disposable income ; accordingly, real GDP in 2014 is also restrained.

 place less weight on downside risks to the reco very.  Accordingly, this scenario assumes 
that household and business pessimism about the economic outlook and uncertainty about 
the durability of the recovery lift more quickly than in the baseline, providing a 
significant boost to aggregate demand.  Increa sed confidence also causes house values to 
recover more quickly, bringing their level 10 percent above the baseline by late 2014, 
with favorable implications  for construction, household wealth, and the willingness of 
financial institutions to extend credit.  As a result, a more robust cycle of increased 
household and business confidence, employment, credit availability, and spending boosts 
the pace of the recovery.  Real GDP accelerates to an average annual growth rate of about 
4 percent in 2013 and 2014, and the unemployment rate falls below 6 percent by the end 
of 2014.  Upward pressure on inflation is init ially tempered by the effects of increased 
capital investment on labor productivity a nd unit labor costs.  But, with resource 
utilization tighter, eventually unit labor costs rise more rapi dly than in the baseline, and 
inflation increases to 2¼ percent later in the decade.  In response to higher inflation and 
the stronger pace of real activity, the federal funds rate lifts off earlier and stays higher 
than in the baseline.5 
More Momentum 
The decline in the unemployment rate over the past year could be a sign that the 
underlying pace of economic activity is stronger than we have assumed in the baseline.  
Indeed, although we have taken some signal fr om recent upside surprises in retail sales 
and housing construction, perhaps we should have taken more.  This scenario takes on 
board this possibility and assumes that the transition of the economy to a self-sustaining 
recovery—in which increases in employment and labor income spur greater spending, credit availability, and business and consum er confidence—occurs sooner and a little 
more rapidly than in the baseli ne.  In addition, this scenario assumes that firms seek to 
more quickly rebuild their workforces, whic h have remained relatively lean throughout 
the recovery, providing an extra boost to labor  demand.  As a result, the unemployment 
                                                 
5 As noted earlier, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio in these 
alternative scenarios are the same as in the baseline.  However, if the unemployment rate were to decline as 
rapidly as shown in the Greater Expectations scenar io, the FOMC might choose to purchase a smaller 
amount of securities than assumed in the baseline.  On e ad hoc way to account for this possibility might be 
to assume that the FOMC ceases adding to its SOMA portfolio beginning in the first quarter of next year, 
reducing the amount of purchases in the first half of  2013 by $500 billio n relative to the baseline.  Staff 
analysis of the effect of LSAPs on the economy sugg ests that this would raise the unemployment rate by 
0.2 percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2014 rela tive to the Greater Expectati ons scenario.  Of course, 
similar considerations could apply to all of the scenarios.

 rate falls more rapidly than in the baseline, reaching 6½ percent by the end of 2014, and 
inflation rises a bit faster.  Liftoff of the federal funds rate occurs in mid-2014.   
Headwinds and Attenuation 
The slow pace of the recovery over the past few years despite a highly 
accommodative monetary policy suggests that we could be underestimating the 
persistence of the headwinds restraining the economy, overes timating the stimulus from 
monetary policy, or both.  In  this scenario, the unfavorab le baseline assumptions for 
fiscal policy, foreign economic conditions, and credit availability turn out to have a more 
restrictive effect on aggregate demand than anticipated; in addition, the eff ectiveness of 
monetary policy to offset those headwinds turn s out to be more attenuated.  As a result, 
the pace of recovery does not pick up:  R eal GDP grows at an annual rate of only 
2 percent in 2013 and 2014, and increases in real  GDP remain below the baseline into the 
second half of the decade.  Wide margins of resource slack put downward pressure on 
inflation and cause inflation e xpectations to edge lower; as  a result, consumer inflation 
falls to 1 percent in 2015.  With inflation well below the FOMC’s longer-run objective 
and the unemployment rate far above its natural rate, the federal funds rate remains at its 
effective lower bound until late 2017.  Despite  the weaker aggregate demand in this 
scenario, we have not built in any degradation to aggregate supply other than the 
endogenous effects of weaker demand on capital deepening. 
Damaged Labor Market 
The unusual depth and breadth of the downt urn may have impaired the efficiency 
of the labor market by more than we judge.  In  this scenario, we assume that the natural 
rate of unemployment reached 7 percent in  early 2011 (1 percentage point above the 
baseline), and that it will remain at that leve l for the indefinite future.  Furthermore, the 
trend labor force participation rate is assu med to be declining more quickly, ending 2015 
more than 1 percentage point below the base line.  These conditions imply lower long-run 
levels of household income and business earnings; as a resu lt underlying aggregate 
demand is weaker and the unemployment rate dec lines more slowly than in the baseline.  
Nevertheless, with a higher natural rate, la bor market slack is narrower, resulting in 
higher unit labor costs and greater upward pressures on consumer prices.  These inflation 
pressures are magnified by the assumption that policymakers initially fail to recognize the 
weaker supply-side conditions, which leads them to maintain a more accommodative 
stance of monetary policy through late 2014 than  they would have chosen with a more

 accurate assessment of the supply side.  In response, the public’s long-run inflation 
expectations are assumed to move up, a nd consumer price inflation rises to around 
2½ percent after 2015.  Largely re flecting these more inflati onary conditions, the federal 
funds rate begins to rise ear lier than in the baseline.   
European Crisis with  Severe Spillovers  
In this scenario, the current economic a nd financial stress in Europe intensifies 
sharply, causing Europe to plunge into a seve re financial crisis and a deep recession.  
Reflecting the greater stress, both soverei gn and private borrowing costs in Europe 
soar—with corporate bond spreads rising 400 basis points above the baseline—and the 
confidence of European households and businesses plummets.  Real GDP in Europe declines about 8½ percent relative to the baseline by the first ha lf of 2014, despite a 
25 percent depreciation in the real effectiv e exchange value of the euro.  Europe’s 
difficulties are assumed to have important financial and economic spillovers to the rest of the world, including the United States.  U.S. economic activity contracts sharply, as U.S. corporate bond spreads rise more than 300 ba sis points, equity pr ices plunge, credit 
availability is restricted, and household and business confidence erodes.  In addition, 
weaker foreign economic activity  and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress 
U.S. net exports.  In all, U.S. real GDP rise s only 1 percent at an a nnual rate in the second 
half of this year before falling 3 percent ne xt year.  The unemployment rate rises to  
10½ percent in 2014 before beginning to gradua lly decline.  With substantially greater 
resource slack and lower import prices, overall U.S. consumer prices decrease in 2013; 
prices begin to rise in 2014 as economic activity starts to recover.
6  Under these 
conditions, the federal funds rate remain s at its effective lower bound until mid-2016. 
Hard Landing in China 
Although real GDP growth in China has slowed  substantially in recent quarters, to 
an annual rate of roughly 7 percent, in our baseline forecast we expect that China’s 
economy will pick up to a growth rate of close to 8 percent in 2013 and 2014.  
                                                 
6 The rebound in consumer price inflation after 2013 in the simulation reflects the forward-looking 
nature of inflation determination in SIGMA and the relatively modest degree of structural inflation 
persistence.  In particular, long-run inflation expecta tions remain firmly anchored at 2 percent, marginal 
costs are expected to rise as the economy recovers, an d productivity is weaker (reflecting reduced capital 
spending).  In addition, import price inflation runs si gnificantly higher than in the baseline as the initial 
appreciation in the exchange value of the dollar is gr adually reversed.  Under alternative specifications of 
SIGMA that, for instance, allowed for more structural persistence in the inflation process or a less firm 
anchoring of inflation expectations, inflation would remain low for a longer period.

 Nevertheless, important downside risks attend this outlook, including th e possibility of a 
collapse in real estate values or a sharp d eceleration in the supply of credit if problems 
mount in China’s banking sector.  In this scenario, we assume that these risks materialize, 
and despite stimulative government policies, r eal GDP in China rises at only a 5 percent 
annual pace over the next two years due to tighter credit conditions, lower investment 
spending, and reduced household and business confidence.  Moreover, we assume that 
the slowdown in China’s economy has pronounced global spillovers, especially to other major U.S. trading partners in Asia.  In th is environment, the trade-weighted exchange 
value of the dollar appreciates about 5 percen t relative to the baseline.  U.S. real net 
exports decline relative to the baseline in response to w eaker foreign economic growth 
and the dollar’s appreciation.  U.S. real GDP expands at an annual rate of only  
1¾ percent in 2013, and the unemployment rate  stays above 8 percent until late 2014, 
about ¾ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Core PCE inflation declines to  
1¼ percent in 2013 and 2014 because of both the appreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and lower re source utilization.  The lifto ff of the federal funds rate 
from its effective lower bound is delayed until early 2016.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained(2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
